  Out-of-Distribution Data",,,"10.1109/ICIP46576.2022.9897514",,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper considers deep out-of-distribution active learning. In practice,
fully trained neural networks interact randomly with out-of-distribution (OOD)
inputs and map aberrant samples randomly within the model representation space.
Since data representations are direct manifestations of the training
distribution, the data selection process plays a crucial role in outlier
robustness. For paradigms such as active learning, this is especially
challenging since protocols must not only improve performance on the training
distribution most effectively but further render a robust representation space.
However, existing strategies directly base the data selection on the data
representation of the unlabeled data which is random for OOD samples by
definition. For this purpose, we introduce forgetful active learning with
switch events (FALSE) - a novel active learning protocol for
out-of-distribution active learning. Instead of defining sample importance on
the data representation directly, we formulate ""informativeness"" with learning
difficulty during training. Specifically, we approximate how often the network
""forgets"" unlabeled samples and query the most ""forgotten"" samples for
annotation. We report up to 4.5\% accuracy improvements in over 270
experiments, including four commonly used protocols, two OOD benchmarks, one
in-distribution benchmark, and three different architectures.

two-dimensional transition metal halides that are experimentally known as van
der Waals bonded bulk materials. Such spin spirals break the rotational
symmetry of the lattice and lead to polar ground states where the axis of
polarization is strongly coupled to the magnetic order (type II multiferroics).
We apply the generalized Bloch theorem in conjunction with non-collinear
density functional theory calculations to find the spiralling vector that
minimizes the energy and then include spin-orbit coupling to calculate the
preferred orientation of the spin plane with respect to the spiral vector. We
find a wide variety of magnetic orders ranging from ferromagnetic, stripy
anti-ferromagnetic, 120$^\circ$ non-collinear structures and incommensurate
spin spirals. The latter two introduce polar axes and are found in the majority
of materials considered here. The spontaneous polarization is calculated for
the incommensurate spin spirals by performing full supercell relaxation
including spinorbit coupling and the induced polarization is shown to be
strongly dependent on the orientation of the spiral planes. We also test the
effect of Hubbard corrections on the results and find that for most materials
LDA+U results agree qualitatively with LDA. An exception is the Mn halides,
which are found to exhibit incommensurate spin spiral ground states if Hubbard
corrections are included whereas bare LDA yields a 120$^\circ$ non-collinear
ground state.

enabling high-impact applications such as web search, question answering, and
natural language processing. They also serve as the backbone for automatic
decision systems, e.g. for medical diagnostics and credit scoring. As
stakeholders affected by these decisions would like to understand their
situation and verify fair decisions, a number of explanation approaches have
been proposed using concepts in description logics. However, the learned
concepts can become long and difficult to fathom for non-experts, even when
verbalized. Moreover, long concepts do not immediately provide a clear path of
action to change one's situation. Counterfactuals answering the question ""How
must feature values be changed to obtain a different classification?"" have been
proposed as short, human-friendly explanations for tabular data. In this paper,
we transfer the notion of counterfactuals to description logics and propose the
first algorithm for generating counterfactual explanations in the description
logic $\mathcal{ELH}$. Counterfactual candidates are generated from concepts
and the candidates with fewest feature changes are selected as counterfactuals.
In case of multiple counterfactuals, we rank them according to the likeliness
of their feature combinations. For evaluation, we conduct a user survey to
investigate which of the generated counterfactual candidates are preferred for
explanation by participants. In a second study, we explore possible use cases
for counterfactual explanations.

the way to a new era of multimessenger observations of cosmic sources.
Second-generation ground-based detectors such as Advanced LIGO and Advanced
Virgo have been extremely successful in detecting gravitational wave signals
from coalescence of black holes and/or neutron stars. However, in order to
reach the required sensitivities, the background noise must be investigated and
removed. In particular, transient noise events called ""glitches"" can affect
data quality and mimic real astrophysical signals, and it is therefore of
paramount importance to characterize them and find their origin, a task that
will support the activities of detector characterization of Virgo and other
interferometers. Machine learning is one of the most promising approaches to
characterize and remove noise glitches in real time, thus improving the
sensitivity of interferometers. A key input to the preparation of a training
dataset for these machine learning algorithms can originate from citizen
science initiatives, where volunteers contribute to classify and analyze
signals collected by detectors. We will present GWitchHunters, a new citizen
science project focused on the study of gravitational wave noise, that has been
developed within the REINFORCE project (a ""Science With And For Society""

between different fitted parameters on this last sample. QUIJOTE-MFI data
contribute to notably improve the characterisation of the AME spectrum, and its
separation from the other components. In particular, ignoring the 10--20\,GHz
data produces on average an underestimation of the AME amplitude, and an
overestimation of the free-free component. We find an average AME peak
frequency of 23.6 $\pm$ 3.6$\,$GHz, about 4$\,$GHz lower than the value
reported in previous studies. The strongest correlation is found between the
peak flux density of the thermal dust and of the AME component. A mild

the interstellar radiation field. On the other hand no correlation is found
between the AME emissivity and the free-free radiation Emission Measure. Our
statistical results suggest that the interstellar radiation field could still
be the main driver of the intensity of the AME as regards spinning dust
excitation mechanisms. On the other hand, it is not clear whether spinning dust
would be most likely associated with cold phases of the interstellar medium

statistically significant spatial variability across the sky. We obtain an
average value of $-3.08$ and a dispersion of $0.13$, considering only pixels
with reliable goodness-of-fit. The power law model of the synchrotron emission
provides a good fit to the data outside the Galactic plane but fails to track
the complexity within this region. Moreover, when we assume a synchrotron model
with uniform curvature, $c_s$, we find a value of $c_s = -0.0797 \pm 0.0012$.
However, there is insufficient statistical significance to determine which

curvature. Furthermore, we estimate the thermal dust spectral parameters in
polarization. Our CMB, synchrotron, and thermal dust maps are highly correlated
with the corresponding products of the PR4 Planck release, although some
large-scale differences are observed in the synchrotron emission. Finally, we
find that the $\beta_s$ estimation in the high signal-to-noise synchrotron

fundamental task in computer science. However, the optimal classical
deterministic algorithm can find the minimum value with a time complexity that
grows linearly with the number of elements in the database. In this paper, we
present the proposal of a quantum algorithm for finding the minimum value of a
database, which is quadratically faster than its best classical analogs. We
assume a Quantum Random Access Memory (QRAM) that stores values from a database
and perform an iterative search based on an oracle whose role is to limit the
searched values by controlling the states of the most significant qubits. A
complexity analysis was performed in order to demonstrate the advantage of this
quantum algorithm over its classical counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrate
how the proposed algorithm would be used in an unsupervised machine learning
task through a quantum version of the K-means algorithm.

human body's expression, has proven to be a constant in numerous studies.
However, due to the enormous amount of data that so far had to be processed by
hand, its crucial role to the formulaic recapitulation of art-historical motifs
since antiquity could only be highlighted selectively. This is true even for
the now automated estimation of human poses, as domain-specific, sufficiently
large data sets required for training computational models are either not
publicly available or not indexed at a fine enough granularity. With the Poses
of People in Art data set, we introduce the first openly licensed data set for
estimating human poses in art and validating human pose estimators. It consists
of 2,454 images from 22 art-historical depiction styles, including those that
have increasingly turned away from lifelike representations of the body since
the 19th century. A total of 10,749 human figures are precisely enclosed by
rectangular bounding boxes, with a maximum of four per image labeled by up to
17 keypoints; among these are mainly joints such as elbows and knees. For
machine learning purposes, the data set is divided into three subsets,
training, validation, and testing, that follow the established JSON-based
Microsoft COCO format, respectively. Each image annotation, in addition to
mandatory fields, provides metadata from the art-historical online encyclopedia
WikiArt. With this paper, we elaborate on the acquisition and constitution of
the data set, address various application scenarios, and discuss prospects for
a digitally supported art history. We show that the data set enables the
investigation of body phenomena in art, whether at the level of individual
figures, which can be captured in their subtleties, or entire figure
constellations, whose position, distance, or proximity to one another is

that the corresponding class of so-called positive energy representations is

dense set of $G$-analytic vectors, then $\rho\big|_G$ is holomorphically

our parallel work (Lorincz-Comi (2023)), this paper established the statistical
theories of multivariable IVW and MRBEE with many weak IVs. First, we showed
that the bias of the multivariable IVW estimate is caused by the
error-in-variable bias, whose scale and direction are inflated and influenced
by weak instrument bias and sample overlaps of exposures and outcome GWAS
cohorts, respectively. Second, we investigated the asymptotic properties of
multivariable IVW and MRBEE, showing that MRBEE outperforms multivariable IVW
regarding unbiasedness of causal effect estimation and asymptotic validity of
causal inference. Finally, we applied MRBEE to examine myopia and revealed that
education and outdoor activity are causal to myopia whereas indoor activity is

future generalization error, should one do this? (2) During optimization such
as via SGD (stochastic gradient descent), we must set the optimization
tolerance $\rho$ -- since it trades off predictive accuracy with computation
cost, how should one set it? Toward these problems, we introduce the {\em

{\em model class mis-specification risk} (the error due to having chosen the
wrong model class) in a theoretical view which is simple, general, and suggests
heuristics that can be used when faced with a dataset instance. In

incorrect parameterization of the IMF. Furthermore, we show that the IMF in the

large number of short-time events compared with the other regions. This recalls

Thus, we introduce a stricter version of monotonicity, termed ""type-K"" in honor

well as the convergence of all trajectories to such equilibria for type-K
monotone and plus-homogeneous systems: we call them ""K-topical"". Since topical
maps are the natural nonlinear counterpart of linear maps defined by
row-stochastic matrices, which are a cornerstone in the convergence analysis of
linear multi-agent systems (MASs), we exploit our results for solving the
consensus problem over nonlinear K-topical MASs. We first provide necessary and
sufficient conditions on the local interaction rules of the agents ensuring the
K-topicality of a MAS. Then, we prove that the agents achieve consensus
asymptotically if the graph describing their interactions contains a globally

  Flexibility","Submitted to IEEE PowerTech 2023",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The ongoing integration of controllable distributed energy resources (DER)
makes distribution networks capable of aggregating flexible power and providing
flexibility services at both transmission and distribution levels. The
aggregated flexibility of an active distribution network (ADN) can be
represented as its feasible operating area in the P-Q space. The limits of this
area are pivotal for arranging flexibility markets and coordinating
transmission and distribution system operators (TSOs and DSOs). However,
motivated by the current technical limitations of distribution networks (e.g.,
protection schemes), existing literature on ADN flexibility and TSO-DSO
coordination mostly focuses on radial networks, overlooking the potential
benefits of network reconfiguration. This paper, using a realistic meshed
distribution system from the UK and the exact ACOPF model for flexibility
estimation, demonstrates that network reconfiguration can increase the limits
of ADN aggregated flexibility and improve the economic efficiency of
flexibility markets.

supernova (SECCSN) progenitors with the stellar evolution code MESA, and find
that the jittering jets explosion mechanism is preferred for explosions where
carbon-oxygen cores with masses of $>20 M_\odot$ collapse to leave a neutron

of $~1.5-2.5 M_\odot$ is ejected in the explosion. We find that the typical
binding energy of the ejecta of stripped-envelope progenitors with
carbon-oxygen core masses of $M_{CO} > 20 M_\odot$ is $E_{bind}>2 \times

jet-driven explosion mechanisms can supply high energies to the explosion. We
apply our results to SN 2020qlb, which is a SECCSN with a claimed core mass of
$~30-50 M_\odot$, and conclude that the jittering jets explosion mechanism best

common for HPC systems to primarily assign resources on a per-node basis to
prevent interference from co-located workloads. This gap between the
coarse-grained resource allocation and the varying resource demands can lead to
HPC resources being not fully utilized. In this study, we analyze the resource
usage and application behavior of NERSC's Perlmutter, a state-of-the-art
open-science HPC system with both CPU-only and GPU-accelerated nodes. Our
one-month usage analysis reveals that CPUs are commonly not fully utilized,
especially for GPU-enabled jobs. Also, around 64% of both CPU and GPU-enabled
jobs used 50% or less of the available host memory capacity. Additionally,
about 50% of GPU-enabled jobs used up to 25% of the GPU memory, and the memory
capacity was not fully utilized in some ways for all jobs. While our study
comes early in Perlmutter's lifetime thus policies and application workload may
change, it provides valuable insights on performance characterization,
application behavior, and motivates systems with more fine-grain resource
allocation.

field of Social Choice with a variety of applications in many different areas
like databases and search engines. Intuitively, given a set of votes over a set
of candidates, the problem asks to find an aggregated ranking of candidates
that minimizes the overall dissatisfaction concerning the votes. Recently, a
diverse version of KRA was considered which asks for a sufficiently diverse set
of sufficiently good solutions. The framework of diversity of solutions is a
young and thriving topic in the field of artificial intelligence. The main idea
is to provide the user with not just one, but with a set of different
solutions, enabling her to pick a sufficiently good solution that satisfies
additional subjective criteria that are hard or impossible to model.
  In this work, we use a quantum annealer to solve the KRA problem and to
compute a representative set of solutions. Quantum annealing is a meta search
heuristic that does not only show promising runtime behavior on currently
existing prototypes but also samples the solutions space in an inherently
different way, making use of quantum effects. We describe how KRA instances can
be solved by a quantum annealer and provide an implementation as well as
experimental evaluations. As existing quantum annealers are still restricted in
their number of qubits, we further implement two different data reduction rules
that can split an instance into a set of smaller instances. In our evaluation,
we compare classical heuristics that allow to sample multiple solutions such as
simulated annealing and local search with quantum annealing performed on a
physical quantum annealer. We compare runtime, quality of solution, and
diversity of solutions, with and without applying preceding data reduction
rules.

obtain infinite commuting families of Hamiltonians of quantum ILW hierarchy
labeled by shape of the auxiliary torus. We calculate explicitly the first five
of these Hamiltonians. Then, we numerically verify that their joint spectrum
can be parametriezed by solutions of Litvinov's Bethe ansatz equations and we
conjecture a general formula for the joint spectrum of all ILW Hamiltonians,
based on results of Feigin, Jimbo, Miwa and Mukhin.
  There are two interesting degeneration limits, the infinitely thick and the
infinitely thin auxiliary torus. In one of these limits, the ILW hierarchy
degenerates to Yangian or Benjamin-Ono hiearchy and the Bethe equations can be
easily solved. The other limit is singular but we can nevertheless extract
local Hamiltonians corresponding to quantum KdV or KP hierarchy. Litvinov's
Bethe equations in this local limit provide an alternative to Bethe ansatz
equations of Bazhanov, Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov, but are more transparent,
work at any rank and are manifestly symmetric under triality symmetry of
$\mathcal{W}_{1+\infty}$. Finally, we illustrate analytic properties of the
solutions of Bethe equations in minimal models, in particular for Lee-Yang CFT.
The analytic structure of Bethe roots is very rich as it reflects the whole

that combines labelled and unlabelled data to learn informative
representations. Our method extends self-supervised contrastive learning --
where representations are shaped by distinguishing whether two samples
represent the same underlying datum (positives) or not (negatives) -- with a
novel approach to selecting positives. To enrich the set of positives, we
leverage the few existing ground-truth labels to predict the missing ones
through a $k$-nearest neighbours classifier by using the learned embeddings of
the labelled data. We thus extend the set of positives with datapoints having
the same pseudo-label and call these semantic positives. We jointly learn the

reinforcing cycle. Strong initial representations enable better pseudo-label
predictions which then improve the selection of semantic positives and lead to
even better representations. SemPPL outperforms competing semi-supervised
methods setting new state-of-the-art performance of $68.5\%$ and $76\%$ top-$1$

of distributions must be non-negative. Our main result is that the $L^{p}$-PP

different, values $2p/(p-1) < q \leq +\infty$. When $p=2$, since
$\infty$-parabolicity coincides with geodesic completeness, our result settles
in the affirmative a conjecture by M. Braverman, O. Milatovic and M. Shubin in

from a complete manifold a possibly singular set with Hausdorff co-dimension
strictly larger than $2p/(p-1)$ or with a uniform Minkowski-type upper estimate
of order $2p/(p-1)$. The threshold value $2p/(p-1)$ is sharp as we show that
when the Hausdorff co-dimension of the removed set is strictly smaller, then
the $L^{p}$-PP fails. This gives a rather complete picture. The tools developed

consequent regularity results for subharmonic distributions, a manifold version

removable singularities results for $L^{p}$-subharmonic distributions and a

That is why singed-directed graph contrastive learning has not been studied
much yet, while there are many contrastive studies for unsigned and undirected.
Thus, this paper proposes a novel signed-directed graph contrastive learning,
SDGCL. It makes two different structurally perturbed graph views and gets node
representations via magnetic Laplacian perturbation. We use a node-level
contrastive loss to maximize the mutual information between the two graph
views. The model is jointly learned with contrastive and supervised objectives.
The graph encoder of SDGCL does not depend on social theories or predefined
assumptions. Therefore it does not require finding triads or selecting
neighbors to aggregate. It leverages only the edge signs and directions via
magnetic Laplacian. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to introduce
magnetic Laplacian perturbation and signed spectral graph contrastive learning.
The superiority of the proposed model is demonstrated through exhaustive
experiments on four real-world datasets. SDGCL shows better performance than
other state-of-the-art on four evaluation metrics.

variety of morphologies found: beyond the canonical tidal tails, our models
reveal that the extra-tidal features generated by globular clusters take a wide
variety of shapes, from thin and elongated shapes, to thick, and complex
halo-like structures. We also compare some of the most well studied stellar

Additionally, we investigate how the distribution and extension in the sky of
the simulated streams vary with the Galactic potential by making use of three
different models, containing or not a central spheroid, or a stellar bar.
Overall, our models predict that the mass lost by the current globular cluster
population in the field from the last 5 Gyrs is between
$0.3-2.1\times10^{7}M_{\odot}$, an amount comparable between 7-55 % of current
mass. Most of this lost mass is found in the inner Galaxy, with the half-mass

two agents, a buyer and a seller, trade an indivisible item. We consider
arguably the simplest form of mechanisms -- the fixed-price mechanisms, where
the designer offers trade at a fixed price to the seller and buyer. Besides the
simple form, fixed-price mechanisms are also the only DSIC and budget balanced
mechanisms in bilateral trade.
  We obtain improved approximation ratios of fixed-price mechanisms in both (i)
the full information setting, where the designer knows the value distributions
of both the seller and buyer; and (ii) the limited information settings. In the
full information setting, we show that the optimal fixed-price mechanism can
achieve at least $0.72$ of the optimal welfare, and no fixed-price mechanism
can achieve more than $0.7381$ of the optimal welfare. Prior to our result the
state of the art approximation ratio was $1 - 1/e + 0.0001\approx 0.632$. We
further consider two limited information settings. In the first one, the
designer is only given the mean of the buyer's value (or the mean of the
seller's value). We show that with such minimal information, one can already
design a fixed-price mechanism that achieves $0.65$ of the optimal social
welfare, which surpasses the previous state of the art ratio in the full
information setting. In the second one, we assume that the designer has access
to more than one but still finitely many samples from the value distributions.
We propose a new family of sample-based fixed-price mechanisms called order
statistic mechanisms and provide a complete characterization of their
approximation ratios for any fixed number of samples. Using the
characterization, we provide the optimal approximation ratios obtainable by
order statistic mechanism for small sample sizes and observe that they
significantly outperform the single sample mechanism.

important question was whether the uniqueness of regular Lagrangian flow could
be implied by proving almost everywhere uniqueness of trajectories. In this
work, we construct an explicit example of divergence-free vector fields in
$W^{1, p}$ with $p < d$ such that the set of initial conditions for which
trajectories are not unique is a set of full measure. To prove this, we build a
vector field $\boldsymbol{u}$ and a corresponding flow map $X^{\boldsymbol{u}}$
such that after finite time $T > 0$, the flow map takes the whole domain
$\mathbb{T}^d$ to a Cantor set $\mathcal{C}_\Phi$, i.e., $X^{\boldsymbol{u}}(T,
\mathbb{T}^d) = \mathcal{C}_\Phi$ and the Hausdorff dimension of this Cantor
set is strictly less than $d$. The flow map $X^{\boldsymbol{u}}$ constructed as
such is not a regular Lagrangian flow. The nonuniqueness of trajectories on a
full measure set is then deduced from the existence of the regular Lagrangian
flow in the DiPerna--Lions theory.

hole (SMBH) in the center of galaxies and their bulge mass or central velocity
dispersion. This suggests a co-evolution between SMBH and their galaxy hosts.
Our aim is to study this relation specifically for radio loud galaxies, and as
a function of redshift $z$. We selected a sample of radio-galaxies and AGN by
cross-matching the low radio frequency sources from VLA FIRST with
spectroscopically confirmed sources from wide field surveys including SDSS DR14
ugriz and DES DR2 grzY in optical, WISE in infrared, and the Galaxy And Mass
Assembly (GAMA) spectroscopic survey. Keeping only high signal to noise (S/N)
sources in WISE magnitudes, and those with broad emission lines, we selected a
sub sample of 42 radio sources, all with infrared-to-optical counterparts, for
which we characterized the stellar, star formation, and black hole properties.
We estimated the central SMBH mass, the stellar mass $M_\star$, the Eddington
ratio $\eta$ and the jet power, $Q_{\rm jet}$. The relation between SMBH mass,
$M_\star$, $\eta$ and $z$ are put into context by comparing them with scaling
relations ($M_{\rm BH}$--$M_{\star}$, $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$--$z$, $M_{\rm
BH}$--$Q_{\rm jet}$ and $Q_{\rm jet}$--$\eta$) from the literature.
  An evolutionary scenario where radio-mode AGN feedback (or the cluster
environments) regulate the accretion onto the SMBHs and the stellar mass
assembly of the radio sources is discussed, which may explain the observed
phenomenology, and in particular the presence of radio sources with high
$M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratios. This pilot study represents a benchmark for future
ones using wide field surveys such as Euclid and the Vera Rubin telescope.

evolution paths, a wide range of resulting atmospheric compositions should be
possible. Atmospheric contamination caused by the outgassing of the underlying
magma ocean is potentially detectable using low resolution spectroscopy. The
James Webb Space Telescope provides the necessary spectral coverage and
sensitivity to characterise smaller planets, including lava worlds. In this
light, we assess observability of outgassed silicates submerged in volatile
atmospheres on the edge of the evaporation valley. By placing a hypothetical 2
R${_\oplus}$ planet around a Sun-like star, we self-consistently model, in 1-D,
a wide range of potential atmospheric compositions, including thermal structure
and outgassing. We focus on atmospheres rich in H, C and N. We assess diverse
chemistry of silicates and volatiles, and what features of outgassed species
could be detected via emission spectroscopy using MIRI LRS. Results indicate
that even for substantial volatile envelopes, strong in infrared opacity, the
presence of silicates causes deep thermal inversions, affecting emission.
Similar to pure lava worlds, SiO remains the only outgassed species with major
infrared, 5 and 9 \textmu m, bands. However, even a small amount of volatiles,
especially of H2O and H-, may hinder its observability. We also find that the
C/O ratio plays a large role in determining the abundance of SiO. Detecting SiO
on a strongly irradiated planet could indicate an atmosphere with high
metallicity and a low C/O ratio, which may be a result of efficient interaction
between the atmosphere and the underlying melt.

incorporates the temporal dimension of interpolation and fuses information from
the input frames and the events adaptively based on their temporal proximity.

entanglement MIPT, entangling dynamics compete with measurement dynamics,
pushing the system either to a phase with extensive entanglement or to a phase
with low-level entanglement. For purification MIPTs, projective measurements
effectively cool and localize the system, inducing a transition from a mixed
state to an uncorrelated pure state. In this work, we numerically simulate
monitored dynamics in the all-to-all Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model for finite
N. We witness both entanglement and purification MIPTs in the steady-state. It
is often said that there is an equivalence between entanglement and
purification MIPTs, however we provide numerical evidence to the contrary,
implying that entanglement and purification MIPTs are indeed two distinct

revive after a completely projective measurement -- if measurements do not

to the idea that the vacuum energy density (VED) is a running quantity with the
cosmological evolution and that this running helps to alleviate the
cosmological tensions afflicting the $\Lambda$CDM. On the theoretical side,
recent devoted studies have shown that the properly renormalized $\rho_{\rm
vac}$ in QFT in FLRW spacetime adopts the ""running vacuum model"" (RVM) form.
While in three previous studies by two of us (CMP and JSP) such computations
focused solely on scalar fields non-minimally coupled to gravity, in the
present work we compute the spin-$1/2$ fermionic contributions and combine them
both. The calculation is performed using a new version of the adiabatic
renormalization procedure based on subtracting the UV divergences at an
off-shell renormalization point $M$. The quantum scaling of $\rho_{\rm vac}$
with $M$ turns into cosmic evolution with the Hubble rate, $H$. As a result the
""cosmological constant"" $\Lambda$ appears in our framework as the nearly
sustained value of $8\pi G(H)\rho_{\rm vac}(H)$ around (any) given epoch $H$,
where $G(H)$ is the gravitational coupling, which is also running, although
very mildly (logarithmically). We find that the VED evolution at present reads
$\delta \rho_{\rm vac}(H)\sim \nu_{\rm eff}\, m_{\rm Pl}^2 \left(H^2-H_0^2
\right)\ (|\nu_{\rm eff}|\ll 1)$. The coefficient $\nu_{\rm eff}$ receives
contributions from all the quantized fields, bosons and fermions. Remarkably,
there also exist higher powers ${\cal O}(H^{6})$ which can trigger inflation in
the early universe. Finally, the equation of state (EoS) of the vacuum receives
also quantum corrections from bosons and fermion fields, shifting its value
from -1. The striking consequence is that the EoS of the quantum vacuum may
nowadays effectively appears as quintessence.

contribution of this work is the meshing module, which represents a scene by an
efficient hierarchical voxels structure, performs fast finding of voxels
observed by new scans, and reconstructs triangle facets in each voxel in an
incremental manner. This voxel-wise meshing operation is delicately designed
for the purpose of efficiency; it first performs a dimension reduction by
projecting 3D points to a 2D local plane contained in the voxel, and then
executes the meshing operation with pull, commit and push steps for incremental
reconstruction of triangle facets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work in literature that can reconstruct online the triangle mesh of
large-scale scenes, just relying on a standard CPU without GPU acceleration. To
share our findings and make contributions to the community, we make our code

critical accretion is found in terms of the coupling constant. In addition, we

  Models for Knowledge-based Visual Reasoning","The first two authors contributed equally to this work",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Large pre-trained vision and language models have demonstrated remarkable
capacities for various tasks. However, solving the knowledge-based visual
reasoning tasks remains challenging, which requires a model to comprehensively
understand image content, connect the external world knowledge, and perform
step-by-step reasoning to answer the questions correctly. To this end, we
propose a novel framework named Interactive Prompting Visual Reasoner (IPVR)
for few-shot knowledge-based visual reasoning. IPVR contains three stages, see,
think and confirm. The see stage scans the image and grounds the visual concept
candidates with a visual perception model. The think stage adopts a pre-trained
large language model (LLM) to attend to the key concepts from candidates
adaptively. It then transforms them into text context for prompting with a
visual captioning model and adopts the LLM to generate the answer. The confirm
stage further uses the LLM to generate the supporting rationale to the answer,
verify the generated rationale with a cross-modality classifier and ensure that
the rationale can infer the predicted output consistently. We conduct
experiments on a range of knowledge-based visual reasoning datasets. We found
our IPVR enjoys several benefits, 1). it achieves better performance than the
previous few-shot learning baselines; 2). it enjoys the total transparency and
trustworthiness of the whole reasoning process by providing rationales for each
reasoning step; 3). it is computation-efficient compared with other fine-tuning
baselines.

in-situ and ex-situ origin of these objects is difficult when we study the
Galactic bulge, which is the most complex and mixed component of the Milky Way.
To investigate the early evolution of the Galactic bulge, we analysed the
globular cluster NGC 6355. We derived chemical abundances and kinematic and
dynamic properties by gathering information from high-resolution spectroscopy
with FLAMES-UVES, photometry with the Hubble Space Telescope, and Galactic
dynamic calculations applied to the globular cluster NGC 6355. We derive an age
of $13.2\pm1.1$ Gyr and a metallicity of [Fe/H]$=-1.39\pm0.08$ for NGC 6355,
with $\alpha$-enhancement of [$\alpha$/Fe]$=+0.37\pm0.11$. The abundance
pattern of the globular cluster is compatible with bulge field RR Lyrae stars
and in-situ well-studied globular clusters. The orbital parameters suggest that
the cluster is currently confined within the bulge volume when we consider a
heliocentric distance of $8.54\pm0.19$ kpc and an extinction coefficient of
$R_V = 2.84\pm0.02$. NGC 6355 is highly likely to come from the main bulge
progenitor. {Nevertheless, it still} has a low probability of being formed from
an accreted event because its age is uncertain and because of the combined
[Mg/Mn] [Al/Fe] abundance. Its relatively low metallicity with respect to old
and moderately metal-poor inner Galaxy clusters may suggest a low-metallicity
floor for globular clusters that formed in-situ in the early Galactic bulge.

find the majority of compact galaxies ($R_{1/2, \star}< 1 \mathrm{pkpc}$),
which drive the negative slope of the size-mass relation, have transitioned
from extended to compact sizes via efficient centralised cooling, resulting in
high specific star formation rates in their cores. These compact stellar
systems are enshrouded by non-star forming gas distributions as much as
$100\times$ larger than their stellar counterparts. By comparing with galaxies
from the EAGLE simulation suite, we find that these extended gas distributions
`turn on' and begin to form stars between $z=5$ and $z=0$ leading to increasing
sizes, and thus the evolution of the size-mass relation from a negative to a
positive slope. This explicitly demonstrates the process of inside-out galaxy
formation in which compact bulges form earlier than the surrounding discs.

in finite specific angular momentum in each infalling shell. Using 3D
hydrodynamical simulations, we follow the infall of this material to small
radii, resolving the circularization radii of the flow. We show that infall of
the convective envelope leads to nearly complete envelope ejection in a
$\gtrsim$ 10$^{48}$ erg explosion with outflow speeds of $\gtrsim$ 200 km/s.
The light curve of such an explosion would show a characteristic, red plateau
as the ejecta cools and a hydrogen recombination front recedes through the
expanding ejecta. Adopting supernova IIp scalings, the event would have a
plateau luminosity of $\gtrsim$ 10$^{40}$ erg/s and a duration of several
hundreds of days. These events would appear quite similar to luminous red novae
with red or yellow supergiant progenitors; some luminous red novae may, in
fact, be signposts of black hole formation. The mechanism studied here produces
more energetic explosions than the weak shock generated from the radiation of
neutrino energy during the proto-neutron star phase. Because we cannot simulate

boundary and defect effects have attracted enormous theoretical and numerical
interests very recently. We focus on decoherence caused by weak measurements
with and without post-selecting the measurement outcomes. Our main results are:
(1) for an O(N) Wilson-Fisher QCP under weak measurement with post-selection,
an observer would in general observe two different types of boundary/defect
criticality with very different behaviors from the well-known Wilson-Fisher
fixed points; in particular, it is possible to observe the recently proposed
exotic ""extraordinary-log"" correlation. (2) An extra quantum phase transition
can be driven by decoherence, if we consider quantities nonlinear with the
decohered density matrix, such as the Renyi entropy. We demonstrate the
connection between this transition to the information-theoretic transition
driven by an error in the toric code model. (3) When there is no
post-selection, though correlation functions between local operators remain the
same as the undecohered pure state, nonlocal operators such as the ""disorder
operator"" would have qualitatively distinct behaviors; and we also show that
the decoherence can lead to confinement.

A web with 7-branes defines a so-called generalized toric polygon (GTP), which
corresponds to combinatorial data that is obtained by removing vertices along
external edges of a toric polygon. We identify the geometries associated to
GTPs as non-toric deformations of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds and provide a

semisimple vacuum expectation values on the worldvolume of D6-branes, which in

However, standard sirens from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers suffer from two
sources of systematic bias, one arising from the anisotropy of GW emission, and
the other from the anisotropy of electromagnetic (EM) emission from the
kilonova. For an observed sample of BNS mergers, the traditional Bayesian
approach to debiasing involves the direct computation of the detection
likelihood. This is infeasible for large samples of detected BNS merger due to
the high dimensionality of the parameter space governing merger detection. In
this study, we bypass this computation by fitting the Hubble constant to
forward simulations of the observed GW and EM data under a simulation-based
inference (SBI) framework using marginal neural ratio estimation. A key
innovation of our method is the inclusion of BNS mergers which were only
detected in GW, which allows for estimation of the bias introduced by EM
anisotropy. Our method corrects for $\sim$90$\%$ of the bias in the inferred
value of $H_0$ when telescope follow-up observations of BNS mergers have
extensive tiling of the merger localization region, using known telescope
sensitivities and assuming a model of kilonova emission. Our SBI-based method
thus enables a debiased inference of the Hubble constant of BNS mergers,

photodissociated. In contrast, the H$_2$ abundance is extremely small and is
insensitive to dust growth, leading to a CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor similar
to the Milky Way value despite the low metallicity. Observationally inferred
dust-to-gas ratio is thus underestimated if adopting the metallicity-dependent
CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor. The newly-produced dust in dense gas mixes with
the ISM through supernova feedback without being completely destroyed by
sputtering, which leads to galactic outflows 20% - 50% dustier than the ISM,
providing a possible source for intergalactic dust.

  Wireless Networks",,,,,"cs.NI cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is an effective approach to train a
deep learning model at multiple nodes over a multi-hop network, without the
need of a server having direct connections to all nodes. In general, as long as
nodes are connected potentially via multiple hops, the DFL process will
eventually allow each node to experience the effects of models from all other
nodes via either direct connections or multi-hop paths, and thus is able to
train a high-fidelity model at each node. We consider an effective attack that
uses jammers to prevent the model exchanges between nodes. There are two attack
scenarios. First, the adversary can attack any link under a certain budget.
Once attacked, two end nodes of a link cannot exchange their models. Secondly,
some jammers with limited jamming ranges are deployed in the network and a
jammer can only jam nodes within its jamming range. Once a directional link is
attacked, the receiver node cannot receive the model from the transmitter node.
We design algorithms to select links to be attacked for both scenarios. For the
second scenario, we also design algorithms to deploy jammers at optimal
locations so that they can attack critical nodes and achieve the highest impact
on the DFL process. We evaluate these algorithms by using wireless signal
classification over a large network area as the use case and identify how these
attack mechanisms exploits various learning, connectivity, and sensing aspects.
We show that the DFL performance can be significantly reduced by jamming
attacks launched in a wireless network and characterize the attack surface as a
vulnerability study before the safe deployment of DFL over wireless networks.

interesting question: can the phases of a system without exact higher-form
symmetries be characterized exactly by emergent higher-form symmetries? Here we
argue the answer is yes by constructing low-energy effective theories for
bosonic lattice Hamiltonian models to identify emergent symmetries. We also
present an alternative point of view for emergent finite symmetries using
topological order in one higher dimension. We find that emergent higher-form
symmetries at zero temperature are robust against local UV perturbations and
become exact symmetries of the effective theory in the thermodynamic limit.
This result is true for both invertible and non-invertible higher-form
symmetries. Therefore, emergent higher-form symmetries are exact emergent
symmetries: they are not UV symmetries but constrain low-energies as if they
were. We demonstrate this in three lattice models, the quantum clock model and
emergent ${\mathbb{Z}_N}$ and ${U(1)}$ ${p}$-gauge theory, finding regions of
parameter space with exact emergent (anomalous) higher-form symmetries. Since
phases of matter are defined in the thermodynamic limit, this implies that a UV
theory without higher-form symmetries can have phases characterized by exact
emergent higher-form symmetries. We discuss in detail the physical consequences
of this and contrast it to emergent ${0}$-form symmetries, which are typically
not exact. Lastly, we show that at finite temperature, emergent 1-form

themselves to neuromorphic hardware. However, the neuromorphic hardware lacks
parallelism and hence, limits the throughput and hardware acceleration of SNNs
on edge devices. To address this problem, many systolic-array SNN accelerators
(systolicSNNs) have been proposed recently, but their reliability is still a
major concern. In this paper, we first extensively analyze the impact of
permanent faults on the SystolicSNNs. Then, we present a novel fault mitigation
method, i.e., fault-aware threshold voltage optimization in retraining
(FalVolt). FalVolt optimizes the threshold voltage for each layer in retraining
to achieve the classification accuracy close to the baseline in the presence of
faults. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mitigation, we
classify both static (i.e., MNIST) and neuromorphic datasets (i.e., N-MNIST and
DVS Gesture) on a 256x256 systolicSNN with stuck-at faults. We empirically show
that the classification accuracy of a systolicSNN drops significantly even at
extremely low fault rates (as low as 0.012\%). Our proposed FalVolt mitigation
method improves the performance of systolicSNNs by enabling them to operate at
fault rates of up to 60\%, with a negligible drop in classification accuracy
(as low as 0.1\%). Our results show that FalVolt is 2x faster compared to other
state-of-the-art techniques common in artificial neural networks (ANNs), such
as fault-aware pruning and retraining without threshold voltage optimization.

present a wide field study of globular clusters (GCs) in NGC 4839 and its

compare the GC system of NGC 4839 with that of NGC 4816, which is the brightest
member (S0) of the nearby group and lies at a similar distance in the west from
the Coma center. Interestingly the spatial distribution of the GCs in NGC 4839
is significantly more compact than that of the GCs in NGC 4816. In addition,
the radial number density profile of the GCs in NGC 4839 shows an abrupt drop
at $R_{N4839}\approx 80$ kpc, while that of the GCs in NGC 4816 shows a
continuous slow decline even in the outer region at $80<R_{N4816}<500$ kpc. The
effective radius of the NGC 4839 GC system is about three times smaller than
that of the NGC 4816 GC system. This striking difference can be explained if
NGC 4839 lost a significant fraction of the GCs in its outskirt when it passed
through Coma. This supports strongly the second infall scenario where the NGC
4839 passed the Coma center about 1.6 Gyr ago, and began the second infall

We address this problem using a cost function based on the Quantum Wasserstein

typically adopted in quantum information processing, $QW_1$ lacks the unitary
invariance property which makes it a suitable tool to avoid to get trapped in
local minima. Focusing on a simple noise model for which an exact QEC solution
is known and can be used as a theoretical benchmark, we run a series of

optical satellite network (FSOSN) with the LISL setup delay; subsequently, we
analyze the impact of LISL setup delay on the end-to-end latency of the FSOSN.
We also provide design guidelines for the laser communication terminal
manufacturers in the form of maximum tolerable value of LISL setup delay for
which the FSOSN based on Starlink's Phase I satellite constellation will be
meaningful to use for low-latency long-distance inter-continental data
communications.

analyze the data being collected and use this information to make on-the-fly
measurement choices, such that the data collected is sparse but representative
of the sample and sufficiently informative. Here, we report the Fast Autonomous
Scanning Toolkit (FAST) that combines a trained neural network, a route
optimization technique, and efficient hardware control methods to enable a
self-driving scanning microscopy experiment. The key features of our method are
that: it does not require any prior information about the sample, it has a very
low computational cost, and that it uses generic hardware controls with minimal
experiment-specific wrapping. We test this toolkit in numerical experiments and
a scanning dark-field x-ray microscopy experiment of a $WSe_2$ thin film, where
our experiments show that a FAST scan of <25% of the sample is sufficient to
produce both a high-fidelity image and a quantitative analysis of the surface
distortions in the sample. We show that FAST can autonomously identify all
features of interest in the sample while significantly reducing the scan time,
the volume of data acquired, and dose on the sample. The FAST toolkit is easy
to apply for any scanning microscopy modalities and we anticipate adoption of
this technique will empower broader multi-level studies of the evolution of
physical phenomena with respect to time, temperature, or other experimental
parameters.

beyond traditional control methods have been proposed to improve the efficiency
of intersection traffic. Amongst these methods, the control of foreseeable
hybrid traffic that consists of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and robot vehicles
(RVs) has recently emerged. We propose a decentralized reinforcement learning
approach for the control and coordination of hybrid traffic at real-world,
complex intersections--a topic that has not been previously explored.
Comprehensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of our
approach. In particular, we show that using 5% RVs, we can prevent congestion
formation inside the intersection under the actual traffic demand of 700
vehicles per hour. In contrast, without RVs, congestion starts to develop when
the traffic demand reaches as low as 200 vehicles per hour. Further performance
gains (reduced waiting time of vehicles at the intersection) are obtained as
the RV penetration rate increases. When there exist more than 50% RVs in
traffic, our method starts to outperform traffic signals on the average waiting
time of all vehicles at the intersection.
  Our method is also robust against both blackout events and sudden RV
percentage drops, and enjoys excellent generalizablility, which is illustrated
by its successful deployment in two unseen intersections.

message-passing programs. They specify communication structures essential for
program correctness; a session type says what and when should be exchanged
through a channel. Central to session-typed languages are sequencing constructs
in types and processes that explicitly specify the order of actions in a
protocol.
  In this paper we study session types without sequencing. The resulting
framework of minimal session types is arguably the simplest form of session
types one could conceive. In the context of a core process calculus with
sessions and higher-order concurrency (abstraction-passing), we establish two
main technical results. First, we prove that every process $P$ typable with
standard session types can be compiled down into a process $\mathcal{D}(P)$
typable with minimal session types. Second, we prove that $P$ and
$\mathcal{D}(P)$ are behaviorally equivalent. These results indicate that
having sequencing constructs in processes and session types is convenient but
redundant: only sequentiality in processes is truly indispensable, as it can
correctly codify sequentiality in types.
  Our developments draw inspiration from work by Parrow on behavior-preserving
decompositions of untyped processes. By casting Parrow's results in the realm
of typed processes, our developments reveal a conceptually simple formulation
of session types and a principled avenue to the integration of session types
into programming languages without sequencing in types.

developments in the field of nonlinear targeted energy transfer (TET) using
\textit{non-resonant} energy exchanges, we achieve this using spatially
localized VI forces that redistribute energy across the linear spectrum of the
lattice in a non-resonant fashion.First, a 1-dimensional (1D), 2-band phononic
lattice with embedded VI unit cells is computationally studied to demonstrate
that energy is scattered in the wavenumber domain, and this nonlinear
scattering mechanism depends on the energy of the propagating wave. Next, a
4-band lattice is studied with a similar technique to demonstrate the concept
of inter-band targeted energy transfer (IBTET) and to establish analogous
scaling relations with respect to energy. To interpret the results of IBTET, we
study the nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) of a reduced order model (ROM) of the
VI unit cell in the 4-band lattice, using the method of numerical continuation.
Interestingly, the slope of the frequency-energy branches of the ROM
corresponding to the 1:1 resonance NNM matches remarkably well with the
dependence of IBTET to input energy in the 4-band lattice. Moreover, relations
between the dynamics of the VI lattice and the NNMs of the underlying
Hamiltonian system provide physical interpretations for the relative energy
transfers.

grid, but their power variations might cause voltage and current constraint
violations in the distribution network, compromising network safety. This could
be avoided by including network constraints within DER control formulations,
but the entities coordinating DERs (e.g., aggregators) may not have access to
network information, which typically is known only to the utility. Therefore,
it is challenging to develop network-safe DER control algorithms when the
aggregator is not the utility; it requires these entities to coordinate with
each other. In this paper, we develop an aggregator-utility coordination
framework that enables network-safe control of thermostatically-controlled
loads to provide frequency regulation. In our framework, the utility sends a
network-safe constraint set on the aggregator's command without directly
sharing any network information. We propose a constraint set construction
algorithm that guarantees satisfaction of a chance constraint on network
safety. Assuming monotonicity of the probability of network safety with respect
to the aggregator's command, we leverage the bisection method to find the
largest possible constraint set, providing maximum flexibility to the
aggregator. Simulations show that, compared to two benchmark algorithms, the
proposed approach provides a good balance between service quality and network
safety.

detailed analysis of arc evolution across frequency and epoch. We perform more
robust determinations of arc curvature and scattering delay
frequency-dependence than allowed by single-frequency-band-per-epoch

report the discovery of a strong correlation between arc asymmetry and arc
curvature, potentially indicating a link between scattering screen distance and
refraction strength or the effect of asymmetric distribution of scattering
material on a scattering screen. Possible evidence for an approximately week
long timescale over which a given scattering screen dominates signal
propagation was found by tracking visible scintillation arcs in each epoch in
PSR J1136+1551. The inclusion of a 155 minute observation allowed us to resolve
the scale of scintillation variations on short timescales, which we find to be
directly tied to the amount of ISM sampled over the observation. Some of our
pulsars showed either consistent or emerging asymmetries in arc curvature,
indicating instances of refraction across their lines of sight. The presence of
significant features in various pulsars, such as multiple scintillation arcs in
PSR J1136+1551 and flat arclets in PSR J1509+5531, that have been found in

  brain activity",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The standard approach to modeling the human brain as a complex system is with
a network, where the basic unit of interaction is a pairwise link between two
brain regions. While powerful, this approach is limited by the inability to
assess higher-order interactions involving three or more elements directly. In
this work, we present a method for capturing higher-order dependencies in
discrete data based on partial entropy decomposition (PED). Our approach
decomposes the joint entropy of the whole system into a set of strictly
non-negative partial entropy atoms that describe the redundant, unique, and
synergistic interactions that compose the system's structure. We begin by
showing how the PED can provide insights into the mathematical structure of
both the FC network itself, as well as established measures of higher-order
dependency such as the O-information. When applied to resting state fMRI data,
we find robust evidence of higher-order synergies that are largely invisible to
standard functional connectivity analyses. This synergistic structure distinct
from structural features based on redundancy that have previously dominated FC
analyses. Our approach can also be localized in time, allowing a frame-by-frame
analysis of how the distributions of redundancies and synergies change over the
course of a recording. We find that different ensembles of regions can
transiently change from being redundancy-dominated to synergy-dominated, and
that the temporal pattern is structured in time. These results provide strong
evidence that there exists a large space of unexplored structures in human
brain data that have been largely missed by a focus on bivariate network
connectivity models. This synergistic ""shadow structures"" is dynamic in time
and, likely will illuminate new and interesting links between brain and
behavior.

recurring problem in formal verification; for example, it arises in our recent
work on efficiently deciding regex constraints in SMT. However,
state-of-the-art graph algorithms for maintaining reachability information
incrementally (that is, as states are visited and before the entire state space
is explored) assume that new edges can be added from any state at any time,
whereas in many applications, outgoing edges are added from each state as it is
explored. To formalize the latter situation, we propose guided incremental
digraphs (GIDs), incremental graphs which support labeling closed states
(states which will not receive further outgoing edges). Our main result is that
dead state detection in GIDs is solvable in $O(\log m)$ amortized time per edge
for $m$ edges, improving upon $O(\sqrt{m})$ per edge due to Bender, Fineman,
Gilbert, and Tarjan (BFGT) for general incremental directed graphs.
  We introduce two algorithms for GIDs: one establishing the logarithmic time
bound, and a second algorithm to explore a lazy heuristics-based approach. To
enable an apples-to-apples experimental comparison, we implemented both
algorithms, two simpler baselines, and the state-of-the-art BFGT baseline using
a common directed graph interface in Rust. Our evaluation shows $110$-$530$x
speedups over BFGT for the largest input graphs over a range of graph classes,
random graphs, and graphs arising from regex benchmarks.

A visibility volume defines the set of admissible (occlusion-free) viewing

  Model Necessary?","Accepted for IEEE PES PowerTech 2023",,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Hybrid power plants comprising renewable power sources and electrolyzers are
envisioned to play a key role in accelerating the transition towards
decarbonization. It is common in the current literature to use simplified
operational models for electrolyzers. It is still an open question whether this
is a good practice, and if not, when a more detailed operational model is
necessary. This paper answers it by assessing the impact of adding different
levels of electrolyzer details, i.e., physics and operational constraints, to
the optimal dispatch problem of a hybrid power plant in the day-ahead time
stage. Our focus lies on the number of operating states (on, off, standby) as
well as the number of linearization segments used for approximating the
non-linear hydrogen production curve. For that, we develop several
mixed-integer linear models, each representing a different level of operational
details. We conduct a thorough comparative ex-post performance analysis under
different price conditions, wind farm capacities, and minimum hydrogen demand
requirements, and discuss under which operational circumstances a detailed
model is necessary. In particular, we provide a case under which a simplified
model, compared to a detailed one, results in a decrease in profit of 1.8% and
hydrogen production of 13.5% over a year. The key lesson learned is that a
detailed model potentially earns a higher profit in circumstances under which
the electrolyzer operates with partial loading. This could be the case for a
certain range of electricity and hydrogen prices, or limited wind power
availability. The detailed model also provides a better estimation of true
hydrogen production, facilitating the logistics required.

adequately from the reconstruction perspective. Extensive experiments support
the versatile transferability of GH-Feat across a range of applications, such

from nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. This idea is contrasted with the mean
free path values in three elastic collision regimes. The main exercise is to
study the behavior of a self-consistent probabilistic distribution function in
a space we have called the reduced phase space, since it is related to the
scattering lifetime. This exercise has been solved in two unconventional
superconductors, for which several calculations are discussed. One of them is
to obtain the scattering phase shift from the inverse strength of an atomic
potential and the other is to build several phases with different nodal
configuration of the superconducting order parameter and show that the

positive for two compounds: the triplet strontium ruthenate and the singlet

the rate of equidistribution in the full family of quartic (sextic, resp.)

reinforcement learning (MARL). One reason is that agents normally choose their
actions independently of one another. In order to see coordination strategies
emerging from the combination of independent policies, the recent research has
focused on the use of a centralized function (CF) that learns each agent's
contribution to the team reward. However, the structure in which the
environment is presented to the agents and to the CF is typically overlooked.
We have observed that the features used to describe the coordination problem
can be represented as vertex features of a latent graph structure. Here, we
present TransfQMix, a new approach that uses transformers to leverage this
latent structure and learn better coordination policies. Our transformer agents
perform a graph reasoning over the state of the observable entities. Our
transformer Q-mixer learns a monotonic mixing-function from a larger graph that
includes the internal and external states of the agents. TransfQMix is designed
to be entirely transferable, meaning that same parameters can be used to
control and train larger or smaller teams of agents. This enables to deploy
promising approaches to save training time and derive general policies in MARL,
such as transfer learning, zero-shot transfer, and curriculum learning. We
report TransfQMix's performances in the Spread and StarCraft II environments.
In both settings, it outperforms state-of-the-art Q-Learning models, and it
demonstrates effectiveness in solving problems that other methods can not
solve.

chromospheric emission regardless of dwarf/giant status or metallicity.
Transformed to Mg2800 flux emerging from the stellar surface, we find a
correlation with temperature with approximately symmetric astrophysical

while the origin destination (OD) type of data, such as NYC taxi data, NYC bike

this paper starts to estimate the OD trips travel time combined with the road
network. Subsequently, a Multitask Weakly Supervised Learning Framework for
Travel Time Estimation (MWSL TTE) has been proposed to infer transition
probability between roads segments, and the travel time on road segments and
intersection simultaneously. Technically, given an OD pair, the transition
probability intends to recover the most possible route. And then, the output of
travel time is equal to the summation of all segments' and intersections'
travel time in this route. A novel route recovery function has been proposed to
iteratively maximize the current route's co occurrence probability, and
minimize the discrepancy between routes' probability distribution and the
inverse distribution of routes' estimation loss. Moreover, the expected log
likelihood function based on a weakly supervised framework has been deployed in
optimizing the travel time from road segments and intersections concurrently.
We conduct experiments on a wide range of real world taxi datasets in Xi'an and
Chengdu and demonstrate our method's effectiveness on route recovery and travel

exceptional degeneracies are the endpoints of lines formed by the eigenvalue
coalescence at finite real energy, resembling the bulk Fermi arcs commonly

of non-Hermiticity are required in contrast to the zero Zeeman field regime.
Furthermore, we find that the spin projections also coalescence at the
exceptional degeneracies and can acquire larger values than in the Hermitian

show that a vast majority of hypergraphs are suppressors of selection under the

empirical performance in various computer vision tasks, and they are viewed as
an important type of foundation model. However, ViTs are typically constructed
with large-scale sizes, which then severely hinder their potential deployment
in many practical resources-constrained applications. To mitigate this
challenging problem, structured pruning is a promising solution to compress
model size and enable practical efficiency. However, unlike its current
popularity for CNNs and RNNs, structured pruning for ViT models is little
explored.
  In this paper, we propose GOHSP, a unified framework of Graph and
Optimization-based Structured Pruning for ViT models. We first develop a
graph-based ranking for measuring the importance of attention heads, and the
extracted importance information is further integrated to an optimization-based
procedure to impose the heterogeneous structured sparsity patterns on the ViT
models. Experimental results show that our proposed GOHSP demonstrates

  Methodologies",,,,,"cs.CY cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Interactive Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are becoming increasingly
prevalent in society. However, application of such systems without
understanding them can be problematic. Black-box AI systems can lead to
liability and accountability issues when they produce an incorrect decision.
Explainable AI (XAI) seeks to bridge the knowledge gap, between developers and
end-users, by offering insights into how an AI algorithm functions. Many modern
algorithms focus on making the AI model ""transparent"", i.e. unveil the inherent
functionality of the agent in a simpler format. However, these approaches do
not cater to end-users of these systems, as users may not possess the requisite
knowledge to understand these explanations in a reasonable amount of time.
Therefore, to be able to develop suitable XAI methods, we need to understand
the factors which influence subjective perception and objective usability. In
this paper, we present a novel user-study which studies four differing XAI
modalities commonly employed in prior work for explaining AI behavior, i.e.
Decision Trees, Text, Programs. We study these XAI modalities in the context of
explaining the actions of a self-driving car on a highway, as driving is an
easily understandable real-world task and self-driving cars is a keen area of
interest within the AI community. Our findings highlight internal consistency
issues wherein participants perceived language explanations to be significantly
more usable, however participants were better able to objectively understand
the decision making process of the car through a decision tree explanation. Our
work also provides further evidence of importance of integrating user-specific
and situational criteria into the design of XAI systems. Our findings show that
factors such as computer science experience, and watching the car succeed or
fail can impact the perception and usefulness of the explanation.

graphs. In the model, a network is generated from a random graph with
independent edges, and agents interact pairwise randomly over the network.
During the process, regular agents average the opinions of themselves and their
neighbors as updates, whereas stubborn agents do not change opinions. To
approximate the original process, we introduce gossip dynamics over an averaged
graph, obtained by averaging all possible networks generated from the random
graph. Using concentration inequalities, we derive high-probability bounds for
the difference between the expected final opinions of the regular agents in the
original gossip process and those in the dynamics over the averaged graph. The
result shows that the expected final opinions for most networks generated from
the random graph are close to the final opinions of the averaged graph, which
are convex combinations of stubborn-agent states with weights depending on link
probability between regular and stubborn agents. We further show how such
concentration can help study the effect of network topology on the expected
final opinions in two cases, using matrix perturbation theory: (i) When the
influence of stubborn agents is large, the original expected final opinions
polarize. (ii) When the influence of stubborn agents is small, the expected
final opinions are close to each other. With the help of concentration
inequalities of Markov chains, we obtain high-probability bounds for the
difference between the time average of agent states in the original process and
the expected final opinions of the averaged graph. As an application, we apply
the results to gossip dynamics over stochastic block models, which generate

range of temperature and crosslink density. Calculations are performed for
model parameters relevant to recent experimental studies of an nm-sized organic
molecule diffusing in crosslinked PnBA networks. The theory predicts the
penetrant alpha relaxation time increases exponentially with the crosslink
fraction ($f_n$) dependent glass transition temperature, $T_g$, which grows
roughly linearly with the square root of $f_n$. Moreover, $T_g$ is also found
to be proportional to a geometric confinement parameter defined as the ratio of
the penetrant diameter to the mean network mesh size. The decoupling ratio of
the penetrant to polymer Kuhn segment alpha relaxation times displays a complex
non-monotonic dependence on crosslink density and temperature that can be well
collapsed based on the variable $T_g(f_n)/T$. The microscopic mechanism for
activated penetrant relaxation is elucidated and a model for the penetrant
diffusion constant that combines activated segmental dynamics and entropic mesh
confinement is proposed which results in a significantly stronger suppression
of mass transport with degree of effective supercooling than predicted for the
penetrant alpha time. This behavior corresponds to a new polymer network-based
type of decoupling of diffusion and relaxation. In contrast to the diffusion of
larger nanoparticles in high temperature rubbery networks, our analysis in the

paper, we use molecular simulation to understand the role that crosslinked
network polymers have in governing the molecular motion of penetrants. By
considering the local, activated alpha relaxation time of the penetrant and its
long-time diffusive dynamics, we can determine the relative importance of
activated glassy dynamics on penetrants at the segmental scale versus entropic
mesh confinement on penetrant diffusion. We vary several parameters, such as
the crosslinking density, temperature, and penetrant size, to show that
crosslinks primarily affect molecular diffusion through modification of the
matrix glass transition, with local penetrant hopping at least partially
coupled to the segmental relaxation of the polymer network. This coupling is
very sensitive to the local activated segmental dynamics of the surrounding
matrix, and we also show that penetrant transport is affected by dynamic
heterogeneity at low temperatures. To contrast, only at high temperatures and
for large penetrants or when the dynamic heterogeneity effect is weak does the
effect of mesh confinement become significant, even though penetrant diffusion
more broadly empirically follows similar trends as established models of mesh
confinement-based transport.

time-consuming procedure that solves eigenvalues and eigenvectors in every
location needed by the coordinate transformation in the conventional method and
thus reduces the computational complexity and improves the efficiency of
generating synthetic turbulence. Through adjusting the generation strategy of
specific random vectors, the proposed method, which is based on the classical
spectrum-based method widely used to generate uniform isotropic turbulence, can
obtain inhomogeneous and anisotropic turbulence with a relatively low
divergence level in practice with almost no additional computational burden.
There are two versions of this new method: the shifter version and the inverter
version. Both versions of the method are highly efficient, easy to implement,
and compatible with high-performance computing. Suitable for providing
high-quality initial or boundary conditions for scale-resolving turbulence
simulations with large grid numbers (such as direct numerical simulation or
large eddy simulation), this method can be quickly implemented either based on
various open-source CFD codes or common commercial CFD software.

inferential tasks such as testing for (conditional) independence of random
variables, constructing confidence intervals in semiparametric location models,
and constructing (by inverting a permutation test) model-free prediction
intervals via conformal inference. Randomization tests are exactly valid for
any sample size, but their use is generally confined to exchangeable data. Yet
in many applications, data is routinely collected adaptively via, e.g.,
(contextual) bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms or adaptive

randomization testing on adaptively collected data (despite its
non-exchangeability) that uses a novel weighted randomization test, for which
we also present novel computationally tractable resampling algorithms for
various popular adaptive assignment algorithms, data-generating environments,
and types of inferential tasks. Finally, we demonstrate via a range of
simulations the efficacy of our framework for both testing and
confidence/prediction interval construction.

location from city-scale point clouds. The task involves two challenges. 1) In
city-scale point clouds, similar ambient instances may exist in several
locations. Searching each location in a huge point cloud with only instances as
guidance may lead to less discriminative signals and incorrect results. 2) In
textual descriptions, the hints are provided separately. In this case, the
relations among those hints are not explicitly described, leading to
difficulties of learning relations. To overcome these two challenges, we
propose a unified Relation-Enhanced Transformer (RET) to improve representation
discriminability for both point cloud and natural language queries. The core of
the proposed RET is a novel Relation-enhanced Self-Attention (RSA) mechanism,
which explicitly encodes instance (hint)-wise relations for the two modalities.
Moreover, we propose a fine-grained cross-modal matching method to further
refine the location predictions in a subsequent instance-hint matching stage.

6$S_{1/2}$ to 6$P_{3/2}$ transition, probes the coupling induced EIT signal. At
the two-photon resonance, we observe that the EIT transmission decreases slowly
with time, which is a signature of interaction induced metastability. The
dephasing rate $\gamma_{\rm OD}$ is extracted with optical depth OD =
$\gamma_{\rm OD}t$. We find that the optical depth linearly increases with time

saturation. The dephasing rate shows a nonlinear dependence on $R_{\rm in}$.
The dephasing mechanism is mainly attributed to the strong dipole-dipole
interactions, which leads to state transfer from $nD_{5/2}$ to other Rydberg
states. We demonstrate that the typical transfer time $\tau_{0(80D)}$ obtained

  Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2109.12731",,,,"q-bio.NC physics.bio-ph","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Young immature granule cells (imGCs) appear via adult neurogenesis in the
hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). In comparison to mature GCs (mGCs) (born during
development), the imGCs exhibit two competing distinct properties such as high
excitability and low excitatory innervation. We develop a spiking neural
network for the DG, incorporating the imGCs, and investigate their effect on
pattern separation. We first consider the effect of high excitability. The
imGCs become very highly active due to their low firing threshold. Then, strong
pattern correlation occurs, which results in pattern integration. On the other
hand, the mGCs exhibit very sparse firing activity due to strongly increased
feedback inhibition. As a result of high sparsity, the pattern separation
efficacy (PSE) of the mGCs becomes very high. Thus, the whole population of GCs
becomes a heterogeneous one, composed of a (major) subpopulation of mGCs (i.e.,
pattern separators) with very low activation degree and a (minor) subpopulation
of imGCs (i.e., pattern integrators) with very high activation degree. In the
whole heterogeneous population, the overall activation degree of all the GCs is
a little reduced in comparison to the activation degree in the presence of only
mGCs without imGCs. However, no pattern separation occurs, due to heterogeneous
sparsity, in contrast to the usual intuitive thought that sparsity could
improve PSE. Next, we consider the effect of low excitatory innervation for the
imGCs. In this case, the imGCs perform pattern integration. The PSE of the mGCs
decreases from a high value to a limit value. In the whole population of all
the GCs, when passing through a threshold, pattern separation starts, the
overall PSE increases and approaches that of the mGCs. However, due to
heterogeneity caused by the imGCs, the overall PSE becomes deteriorated, in
comparison with that in the presence of only mGCs.

High latitude molecular clouds (hereafter HLMCs) permit the study of
interstellar gas dynamics and astrochemistry with good accuracy due to their
proximity, generally clear lines of sight, and lack of internal star-forming
activity which can heavily modify the physical context. MBM 40, one of the
nearest HLMCs, has been extensively studied, making it a superb target to infer
and study the dust-to-gas mixing ratio (DGMR).
  Aims. The mixing of dust and gas in the interstellar medium remains a
fundamental issue to keep track of astrochemistry evolution and molecular
abundances. Accounting for both molecular and atomic gas is difficult because
$H_2$ is not directly observable and HI spectra always show different dynamical
profiles blended together which are not directly correlated with the cloud. We
used two independent strategies to infer the molecular and atomic gas column
densities and compute the dust-to-gas mixing ratio.
  Methods. We combined $HI$ 21 cm and $^{12}CO$ line observations with the IRAS
100 $\mu$m image to infer the dust-to-gas mixing ratio within the cloud. The
cloud 21 cm profile was extracted using a hybrid Gaussian decomposition where
$^{12}CO$ was used to deduce the total molecular hydrogen column density.
Infrared images were used to calculate the dust emission.
  Results. The dust-to-gas mixing ratio is nearly uniform within the cloud as
outlined by the hairpin structure. The total hydrogen column density and 100
$\mu$m emissivity are linearly correlated over a range in $N(H_{tot})$ of one
order of magnitude.

Multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT) dual-connectivity handover. We

  Learning and Shape Prior","29 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Medical images are generally acquired with limited field-of-view (FOV), which
could lead to incomplete regions of interest (ROI), and thus impose a great
challenge on medical image analysis. This is particularly evident for the
learning-based multi-target landmark detection, where algorithms could be
misleading to learn primarily the variation of background due to the varying
FOV, failing the detection of targets. Based on learning a navigation policy,
instead of predicting targets directly, reinforcement learning (RL)-based
methods have the potential totackle this challenge in an efficient manner.
Inspired by this, in this work we propose a multi-agent RL framework for
simultaneous multi-target landmark detection. This framework is aimed to learn
from incomplete or (and) complete images to form an implicit knowledge of
global structure, which is consolidated during the training stage for the
detection of targets from either complete or incomplete test images. To further
explicitly exploit the global structural information from incomplete images, we
propose to embed a shape model into the RL process. With this prior knowledge,
the proposed RL model can not only localize dozens of targetssimultaneously,
but also work effectively and robustly in the presence of incomplete images. We
validated the applicability and efficacy of the proposed method on various
multi-target detection tasks with incomplete images from practical clinics,
using body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), cardiac MRI and head CT
datasets. Results showed that our method could predict whole set of landmarks
with incomplete training images up to 80% missing proportion (average distance
error 2.29 cm on body DXA), and could detect unseen landmarks in regions with
missing image information outside FOV of target images (average distance error
6.84 mm on 3D half-head CT).

embedding on the torus, such that each face of the embedding is a 4-cycle. The

by r when traversing the meridian of length m.
  In 2008, Steve Wilson found two interesting infinite families of

that the canonical bipartite double cover of the grid has more than twice as
many automorphisms as the grid has.) It is easy to see that bipartite grids are
also unstable, because the canonical double cover is disconnected. Furthermore,
there are degenerate cases in which there exist two different vertices that
have the same neighbours. This paper proves Wilson's conjecture that Qd(m,n,r)
is stable for all other values of the parameters.
  In addition, we prove an analogous conjecture of Wilson for the triangular

universe. Studies have shown that Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC), which is an
attempt to extend inflationary scenario to planck scales, leads to a strongly
scale dependent and oscillatory non-Gaussianity. In particular, the
non-Gaussianity function $f_{_{\rm NL}}(k_1,\, k_2,\, k_3)$ generated in LQC,
though similar to that generated during slow roll inflation at small scales, is
highly scale dependent and oscillatory at large wavelengths. In this work, we
investigate the imprints of such a primordial bispectrum in the bispectrum of
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Inspired by earlier works, we propose an
analytical template for the primordial bispectrum in LQC and compute the
corresponding reduced bispectra of temperature and electric polarisation and
their three-point cross-correlations. We show that CMB bispectra generated in
LQC is consistent with the observations from Planck. We conclude with a
discussion of our results and its implications to LQC.

new dataset, electromyography analysis of human activities - database 2

isometric and isotonic activities during weight training. Previously, a novel
Laplacian-Gaussian Mixture (LGM) model was demonstrated for a few benchmark

suitability analysis is extended to the EMAHA-DB2 dataset. Further, the LGM
model is compared with three existing statistical models including the recent
scale-mixture model. According to qualitative and quantitative analyses, the
LGM model has a better fit to the empirical pdf of the recorded sEMG signals
compared with the scale mixture model and the other standard models. The
variance and mixing weight of the Laplacian component of the signal are
analyzed with respect to the type of muscle, type of muscle contraction,
dumb-bell weight and training experience of the subjects. The sEMG variance
(the Laplacian component) increases with respect to the weights, is greater for
isotonic activity especially for the biceps. For isotonic activity, the signal
variance increases with training experience. Importantly, the ratio of the
variances from the two muscle sites is observed to be nearly independent of the
lifted weight and consistently increases with the training experience.

produced when a high-power circular-polarized laser pulse travels through a
micro-scale waveguide. However, the harmonic generation quenches typically
after a few tens of microns of propagation, due to the build-up of
electrostatic potential that suppresses the amplitude of the surface wave. Here
we propose to utilize a hollow-cone channel to overcome this obstacle. When
traveling in a cone target, the laser intensity gradually increases, allowing
the surface wave to maintain a high amplitude for a much longer distance. The
harmonic vortices can be produced with very high efficiency. According to
three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, the overall efficiency are
boosted by almost one order of magnitude, reaching $>20\%$. It is also found
that using the cone targets can mitigate efficiency decline due to pre-heating
of plasma by laser prepulse. The proposed scheme paves the way to the
development of powerful optical vortices sources in the extreme ultraviolet

observe that the data flow in a system consisting of a model and the Kalman
filter can be interpreted to be the same as the data flow in a recurrent neural
network (RNN). Thus, instead of building more sophisticated models and data
assimilation methods, we want to train a RNN to approximate the dynamics of the
response of the FMC sensor to a time series of environmental data. Because
standard AI approaches did not converge to reasonable solutions, we pre-train
the RNN with special initial weights devised to turn it into a numerical solver
of the differential equation. We then allow the AI training machinery to
optimize the RNN weights to fit the data better. We illustrate the method on an
example of a time series of 10h-FMC from RAWS and weather data from the
Real-Time Mesoscale Analysis (RTMA).

fascinating topics in soft matter physics, particularly for out-of-equilibrium
systems, which can lead to rich rheological behaviours in the presence of
steady shear flow. In this article, the role of self-propulsion in the
rheological response of a dense colloidal suspension is investigated by using
particle-resolved simulations. First, the interplay between activity and shear
in the solid to the liquid transition of the suspension is analysed. While both
self-propulsion and shear destroy order and melt the system by themselves above
their critical values, self-propulsion lowers the stress barrier that needs to
be overcome during the transition. Once the suspension reaches a
non-equilibrium steady state the rheological response is analysed. While
passive suspensions show a solid-like behaviour, turning on particle motility
fluidises the system and, at low self-propulsion, the suspension behaves as a
shear-thinning fluid. Increasing the self-propulsion of the colloids induces a
transition from a shear-thinning to a shear-thickening behaviour, which we
attribute to clustering in the suspensions induced by motility. This
interesting phenomenon of motility-induced shear thickening (MIST) can be used
to tailor the rheological response of colloidal suspensions.

similarities in this work. Despite their efficiency, these methods suffer from
the suboptimal representative capacity, since they forgo the correlation
established by connecting multiple first-order similarities, i.e., the relation
among the indirect instances, which could be defined as the high-order

the high-order similarities in the Hamming space through the user-item
bipartite graph. Therefore, we develop a novel learning to hash framework,
namely Hamming Spatial Graph Convolutional Networks (HS-GCN), which explicitly
models the Hamming similarity and embeds it into the codes of users and items.

system with deterministic thresholds is a challenging problem due to the
non-stationary nature of the system's stochastic processes. A typical example
is the computation of the average communication rate (ACR) of the networked
event-triggered stochastic control systems (ET-SCS) of which the communication
of the sensor network is scheduled by whether a system variable of interest
exceeds predefined constant thresholds. For such a system, a closed-loop effect
emerges due to the interdependence between the system variable and the trigger
of communication. This effect, commonly referred to as \textit{side
information} by related work, distorts the stochastic distribution of the
system variables and makes the ACR computation non-trivial. Previous work in
this area used to over-simplify the computation by ignoring the side
information and misusing a Gaussian distribution, which leads to approximated
results. This paper proposes both analytical and numerical approaches to
predict the exact ACR for an ET-SCS using a recursive model. Furthermore, we
use theoretical analysis and a numerical study to qualitatively evaluate the
deviation gap of the conventional approach that ignores the side information.
The accuracy of our proposed method, alongside its comparison with the
simplified results of the conventional approach, is validated by experimental
studies. Our work is promising to benefit the efficient resource planning of
networked control systems with limited communication resources by providing
accurate ACR computation.

electric fields acting on conduction electrons. This in turn leads to the
emergent electromagnetic induction effect which may realize quantum inductor
elements of micrometer size. ${\rm YMn}_{6}{\rm Sn}_{6}$ is a helimagnet with a
short helical period (2-3 nm) that shows this type of emergent inductance
beyond room temperature. To identify the optimized materials conditions for
${\rm YMn}_{6}{\rm Sn}_{6}$-type room-temperature emergent inductors, we have
investigated emergent electromagnetic inductance (EEMI) as the magnetism is
modified through systematic partial substitution of Y by Tb. By small angle
neutron scattering and inductance measurements, we have revealed that the
pinning effect on the spin-helix translational mode by Tb doping selectively
and largely suppresses the negative component of EEMI, while sustaining the
positive inductance arising from the spin tilting mode. We also find that in
addition to the spin helix, even the spin-collinear antiferromagnetic structure
can host the positive EEMI due to thermally enhanced spin fluctuations. The
present study highlights the facile control of both the magnitude and sign of
EEMI beyond room temperature, and thus suggests a route to expand the range of
emergent inductor candidate materials.

eruptive phenomena at the Sun, and represent one of the main sources of
energetic particles. Several interplanetary shock crossings by spacecraft at
$1$ AU have revealed enhanced energetic-ion fluxes that extend far upstream of
the shock. Surprisingly, in some shock events, ion fluxes with energies between
$100$ keV and about $2$ MeV acquire similar values (which we refer to as
``overlapped'' fluxes), corresponding to flat energy spectra in that range. In
contrast, closer to the shock, the fluxes are observed to depend on energy. In
this work, we analyze three interplanetary shock-related energetic particle
events observed by the Advanced Composition Explorer spacecraft where flat ion
energy spectra were observed upstream of the shock. We interpret these
observations via a velocity filter mechanism for particles in a given energy
range. This reveals that low energy particles tend to be confined to the shock
front and cannot easily propagate upstream, while high energy particles can.
The velocity filter mechanism has been corroborated from observations of
particle flux anisotropy by the Solid-State Telescope of Wind/3DP.

confirmation that vulnerability labels are correct or consistent. Our study
seeks to address such shortcomings by inspecting five inherent data quality
attributes for four state-of-the-art software vulnerability datasets and the
subsequent impacts that issues can have on software vulnerability prediction

is a conventional workhorse in the high-pressure community: create implanted NV
centers (INVs) at the diamond anvil tip or immerse NV-enriched nano-diamonds
(NDs) in the pressure medium. Nonetheless, there are limited studies on
comparing the local stress environments experienced by these sensor types as
well as their performances as pressure gauges. In this work, by probing the NV
energy levels with the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) method, we
experimentally reveal a dramatic difference in the partially reconstructed
stress tensors of INVs and NDs incorporated in the same DAC. Our measurement
results agree with computational simulations, concluding that INVs perceive a
more non-hydrostatic environment dominated by a uniaxial stress along the DAC
axis. This provides insights on the suitable choice of NV sensors for specific
purposes and the stress distribution in a DAC. We further propose some possible
methods, such as using NDs and nanopillars, to extend the maximum working
pressure of quantum sensing based on ODMR spectroscopy, since the maximum
working pressure could be restricted by non-hydrostaticity of the pressure
environment. Moreover, we explore more sensing applications of the NV center by
studying how pressure modifies different aspects of the NV system. We perform a
photoluminescence study using both INVs and NDs to determine the pressure
dependence of the zero-phonon line, which helps developing an all-optical
pressure sensing protocol with the NV center. We also characterize the

initially introduced to solve tropical linear systems using Cramer's rule. It
is equivalent to the real tropical hyperfield, which has been used in the study
of tropicalizations of semialgebraic sets. Polynomials over the symmetrized
tropical semiring, and their factorizations, were considered by Quadrat.
Recently, Baker and Lorscheid introduced a notion of multiplicity for the roots
of univariate polynomials over hyperfields. In the special case of the
hyperfield of signs, they related multiplicities with Descarte's rule of sign
for real polynomials. We investigate here the factorizations of univariate
polynomial functions over symmetrized tropical semirings, and relate them with
the multiplicities of roots over these semirings. We deduce a Descartes' rule
for ``signs and valuations'', which applies to polynomials over a real closed
field with a convex valuation and an arbitrary (divisible) value group. We show
in particular that the inequality of the Descartes' rule is tight when the
value group is non-trivial. This extends to arbitrary value groups a
characterization of Gunn in the rank one case, answering also to the tightness
question. Our results are obtained using the framework of semiring systems
introduced by Rowen, together with model theory of valued fields.

ultra-soft X-ray source (photon index $\sim 4$) during the second SRG/eROSITA
All-Sky Survey (eRASS2), where it had brightened in the 0.3--2~keV band by a
factor of more than $\sim$160 relative to an archival 3$\sigma$ upper limit
inferred from a serendipitous Chandra pointing in 2011. The transient was also
independently found in the optical by the Zwicky Transient Factory (ZTF), with
the eRASS2 detection occurring only $\sim$20 days after the peak optical
brightness, suggesting that the accretion disc formed promptly in this TDE.
Continued X-ray monitoring over the following $\sim$400 days by eROSITA, NICER
XTI and Swift XRT showed a net decline by a factor of $\sim$100, albeit with
large amplitude X-ray variability where the system fades, and then rebrightens,
in the 0.3--2~keV band by a factor $\sim$50 during an 80 day period.
Contemporaneous Swift UVOT observations during this extreme X-ray variability
reveal a relatively smooth decline, which persists over $\sim$400 days
post-optical peak. The peak observed optical luminosity (absolute $g$-band
magnitude $\sim -16.8$ mag) from this transient makes J0744 the faintest
optically-detected TDE observed to date. However, contrasting the known set of
`faint and fast' TDEs, the optical emission from J0744 decays slowly
(exponential decay timescale $\sim$120~days), making J0744 the first member of
a potential new class of `faint and slow' TDEs.

matter with internal energy, composed of many fast interacting particles inside

scale. The environment, assumed to be slow, is modeled through experimental
constraints on macroscopic quantities (e.g. energy, particle number, etc), with
a partitioning into two classes: non fluctuating and fluctuating values. The
method to derive the PH macroscopic laws is detailed in several steps and
illustrated on two standard cases (ideal gas, Ising ferromagnets). It revisits
equilibrium statistical physics with a focus on this partitioning. First, the
Boltzmann's principle is used to provide the statistic law of the matter. It
defines a macroscopic equilibrium characterized by a scalar value, the entropy,
together with thermodynamic quantities emerging from each constraint. Then, the
port-Hamiltonian system is derived. The Hamiltonian (macroscopic energy) is
derived as a function of the macroscopic state (entropy and the macroscopic
quantities associated with the fluctuating class). The ports (flows/efforts)
are related to the time-derivative of the state and the Hamiltonian gradient in
a conservative way. This open system defines the reversible laws that govern
standard thermodynamic quantities. Lastly, this paper presents a strategy to
extend this PH system to an irreversible conservative one, given a macroscopic
dissipative law.

treatments based on patients' characteristics. The value function of an ITR is
the expected outcome in a counterfactual world had this ITR been implemented.
Recently, there has been increasing interest in combining heterogeneous data
sources, such as leveraging the complementary features of randomized controlled
trial (RCT) data and a large observational study (OS). Usually, a covariate
shift exists between the source and target population, rendering the
source-optimal ITR unnecessarily optimal for the target population. We present
an efficient and robust transfer learning framework for estimating the optimal
ITR with right-censored survival data that generalizes well to the target
population. The value function accommodates a broad class of functionals of
survival distributions, including survival probabilities and restrictive mean
survival times (RMSTs). We propose a doubly robust estimator of the value
function, and the optimal ITR is learned by maximizing the value function
within a pre-specified class of ITRs. We establish the $N^{-1/3}$ rate of
convergence for the estimated parameter indexing the optimal ITR, and show that
the proposed optimal value estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal
even with flexible machine learning methods for nuisance parameter estimation.
We evaluate the empirical performance of the proposed method by simulation
studies and a real data application of sodium bicarbonate therapy for patients
with severe metabolic acidaemia in the intensive care unit (ICU), combining a
RCT and an observational study with heterogeneity.

agnostic to the choice of recommendation algorithms. Our solution disentangles
the learnt user representation in the recommendation module into
category-independent and category-dependent components to differentiate a
user's preference over items from two orthogonal perspectives. Experimental

to guarantee model performance, which require a significant amount of expert
annotated samples that are high-cost and laborious. Semi-supervised image
segmentation can alleviate the problem by utilizing a large number of unlabeled
images along with limited labeled images. However, learning a robust
representation from numerous unlabeled images remains challenging due to
potential noise in pseudo labels and insufficient class separability in feature
space, which undermines the performance of current semi-supervised segmentation
approaches. To address the issues above, we propose a novel semi-supervised
segmentation method named as Rectified Contrastive Pseudo Supervision (RCPS),
which combines a rectified pseudo supervision and voxel-level contrastive
learning to improve the effectiveness of semi-supervised segmentation.
Particularly, we design a novel rectification strategy for the pseudo
supervision method based on uncertainty estimation and consistency
regularization to reduce the noise influence in pseudo labels. Furthermore, we
introduce a bidirectional voxel contrastive loss to the network to ensure
intra-class consistency and inter-class contrast in feature space, which
increases class separability in the segmentation. The proposed RCPS
segmentation method has been validated on two public datasets and an in-house
clinical dataset. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method yields
better segmentation performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation. The source code is available at

dynamic mode decomposition to generate a low-dimensional, linear model of a

temporal and spatial modes, that we can then use with data assimilation
techniques such as the ensemble Kalman filter. We show how the dynamic mode
decomposition can be combined with the ensemble Kalman filter (which we call
the DMDEnKF) to iteratively update the current state and temporal modes as new

varying dynamical systems in synthetic examples, and experiment with the use of
time-delay embeddings. We then apply the DMDEnKF to real world seasonal

weight of any independent set not contained in the MWIS is bounded from above
by the weight of the intersection of its closed neighbor set and the MWIS, we
give two extension theorems -- independent set extension theorem and vertex
cover extension theorem. With them at our disposal, two types of causal
inference techniques (CITs) are proposed on the assumption that a vertex is
strongly reducible (included or not included in all MWISs) or reducible
(contained or not contained in a MWIS). One is a strongly reducible
state-preserving technique, which extends a strongly reducible vertex into a
vertex set where all vertices have the same strong reducibility. The other, as
a reducible state-preserving technique, extends a reducible vertex into a
vertex set with the same reducibility as that vertex and creates some weighted
packing constraints to narrow the search space. Numerical experiments show that
our CITs can help reduction algorithms find much smaller remaining graphs,
improve the ability of exact algorithms to find the optimal solutions and help
heuristic algorithms produce approximate solutions of better quality. In
particular, detailed tests on $12$ representative graphs generated from
datasets in Network Data Repository demonstrate that, compared to the
state-of-the-art algorithms, the size of remaining graphs is further reduced by
more than 32.6%, and the number of solvable instances is increased from 1 to 5.

Utilizing this quadrature-PT structure, we have further studied its potential

that resonators can be optimized to selectively sense either the quantum vortex
density carried by the throughflow -- as typically done in the literature -- or
the mean velocity of the throughflow. We propose two velocity probing methods:
one that takes advantage of geometrical misalignments between the tweezers

that results in the self-sustainment of a vortex tangle within the cavity.A new
mathematical treatment of the resonant signal is proposed to adequately filter

from large correction terms due to quadratic divergence coming from the self
energy corrections. Veltman Condition (V.C.) ensures that the coefficient of
the quadratic divergent term either vanishes or becomes negligible. If the
Standard Model is valid up-to a scale ($\Lambda$) and new physics takes over
beyond that; Veltman condition demands $\Lambda\lesssim 760$ GeV. But the
non-observation of new physics has pushed $\Lambda$ to be $\geq 1$ TeV already,
making it impossible to satisfy the Veltman condition in the Standard Model
without very large fine tuning. Attempts has been made to satisfy the V.C. in
many Beyond Standard Model theories but they fail to satisfy the V.C. at large
$\Lambda$ including the theory of complex scalar triplet with hypercharge $1$.
Hence, an alternate scenario can be considered where the new physics appears
much above the Electroweak scale. Then, the effect of the new physics can be
observed by integrating out the new degrees of freedoms in terms of the Wilson
Coefficients of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) operators.
Here we consider some specific new physics models to appear at a very large

found that the V.C. satisfies easily in the type-II seesaw model with complex
scalar triplet ($Y=1$) compared to the other extensions in the BSM-EFT

insights into engineering design problems. Concept identification aims at
identifying non-overlapping groups of design instances that are similar in a

subsets of features. These subsets usually comprise features that characterize
a design with respect to one specific context, for example, constructive design
parameters, performance values, or operation modes. It is desirable to evaluate
the quality of design concepts by considering several of these feature subsets
in isolation. In particular, meaningful concepts should not only identify
dense, well separated groups of data instances, but also provide
non-overlapping groups of data that persist when considering pre-defined
feature subsets separately. In this work, we propose to view concept
identification as a special form of clustering algorithm with a broad range of
potential applications beyond engineering design. To illustrate the differences
between concept identification and classical clustering algorithms, we apply a
recently proposed concept identification algorithm to two synthetic data sets

mutual information measure as a metric to evaluate whether solutions return
consistent clusters across relevant subsets. To support the novel understanding
of concept identification, we consider a simulated data set from a
decision-making problem in the energy management domain and show that the
identified clusters are more interpretable with respect to relevant feature
subsets than clusters found by common clustering algorithms and are thus more
suitable to support a decision maker.

dependency on annotated data of specific scene makes it hard for DCNNs to fit
different RS scenes. To solve this problem, recent works gradually focus on
cross-domain RS image semantic segmentation task. In this task, different
ground sampling distance, remote sensing sensor variation and different
geographical landscapes are three main factors causing dramatic domain shift
between source and target images. To decrease the negative influence of domain
shift, we propose a self-training guided disentangled adaptation network
(ST-DASegNet). We first propose source student backbone and target student
backbone to respectively extract the source-style and target-style feature for
both source and target images. Towards the intermediate output feature maps of
each backbone, we adopt adversarial learning for alignment. Then, we propose a
domain disentangled module to extract the universal feature and purify the
distinct feature of source-style and target-style features. Finally, these two
features are fused and served as input of source student decoder and target
student decoder to generate final predictions. Based on our proposed domain
disentangled module, we further propose exponential moving average (EMA) based
cross-domain separated self-training mechanism to ease the instability and
disadvantageous effect during adversarial optimization. Extensive experiments

previous methods on cross-domain RS image semantic segmentation task and
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Our code is available at

fitting the luminosity distribution, stellar kinematics, and age and
metallicity maps simultaneously, we obtained the internal stellar orbit
distribution, as well as the age and metallicity distribution of stars on

into a dynamically cold disk (orbital circularity $\lambda_z\ge0.8$) and a
dynamically hot non-disk component (orbital circularity $\lambda_z<0.8$), and
obtain the surface-brightness, age, and metallicity radial profiles of each
component. The galaxy infall time into the cluster is strongly correlated with
galaxy cold-disk age with older cold disks in ancient infallers. We quantify
the infall time $t_{\rm infall}$ of each galaxy with its cold-disk age using a
correlation calibrated with TNG50 cosmological simulations. For galaxies in the
Fornax cluster, we found that the luminosity fraction of cold disk in galaxies
with $t_{\rm infall}>8$ Gyr are a factor of $\sim 4$ lower than in more recent
infallers while controlling for total stellar mass. Nine of the 16 galaxies
have spatially extended cold disks, and most of them show positive or zero age
gradients; stars in the inner disk are $\sim 2-5$ Gyr younger than that in the
outer disk, in contrast to the expectation of inside-out growth. Our results
indicate that the assembly of cold disks in galaxies is strongly affected by
their infall into clusters, by either removal of gas in outer regions or even
tidally stripping or heating part of the pre-existing disks. Star formation in
outer disks can stop quickly after the galaxy falls into the cluster, while
star formation in the inner disks can last for a few Gyrs more, building the
positive age gradient measured in cold disks.

Next, a novel group-T-matrix-based multiple scattering fast algorithm is
developed to describe a representative inhomogeneous electromagnetic space. All
the analytical results are validated by simulations. In addition, the complete
form of the EMIT-based model is proposed to derive the informatics parameters
frequently used in electromagnetic propagation, through integrating the mode
analysis method with the dyadic Green's function matrix. Finally, as a
proof-or-concept, microwave anechoic chamber measurements of a cylindrical

components, for example voltage regulators for power management. Those are
connected to the CPU and the separate Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) via
the I2C-based PMBus.
  In this paper, using the case study of the widely used Supermicro X11SSL
motherboard, we show how remotely exploitable software weaknesses in the BMC
(or other processors with PMBus access) can be used to access the PMBus and
then perform hardware-based fault injection attacks on the main CPU. The
underlying weaknesses include insecure firmware encryption and signing
mechanisms, a lack of authentication for the firmware upgrade process and the
IPMI KCS control interface, as well as the motherboard design (with the PMBus
connected to the BMC and SMBus by default).
  First, we show that undervolting through the PMBus allows breaking the
integrity guarantees of SGX enclaves, bypassing Intel's countermeasures against
previous undervolting attacks like Plundervolt/V0ltPwn. Second, we
experimentally show that overvolting outside the specified range has the
potential of permanently damaging Intel Xeon CPUs, rendering the server
inoperable. We assess the impact of our findings on other server motherboards
made by Supermicro and ASRock.
  Our attacks, dubbed PMFault, can be carried out by a privileged software
adversary and do not require physical access to the server motherboard or
knowledge of the BMC login credentials.
  We responsibly disclosed the issues reported in this paper to Supermicro and
discuss possible countermeasures at different levels. To the best of our
knowledge, the 12th generation of Supermicro motherboards, which was designed

demonstrated great potential, existing works are either limited by fixed models
or require enormous data/time for online adaptation, which struggle to fit
time-varying and diverse network states. Driven by these practical concerns, we
perform large-scale measurements on WeChat for Business's interactive video
service to study real-world network fluctuations. Surprisingly, our analysis
shows that, compared to time-varying network metrics, network sequences exhibit
noticeable short-term continuity, sufficient for few-shot learning
requirements. We thus propose Fiammetta, the first meta-RL-based bitrate
adaptation algorithm for interactive video streaming. Building on the
short-term continuity, Fiammetta accumulates learning experiences through
offline meta-training and enables fast online adaptation to changing network
states through a few gradient updates. Moreover, Fiammetta innovatively
incorporates a probing mechanism for real-time monitoring of network states,
and proposes an adaptive meta-testing mechanism for seamless adaptation. We
implement Fiammetta on a testbed whose end-to-end network follows the
real-world WeChat for Business traces. The results show that Fiammetta
outperforms prior algorithms significantly, improving video bitrate by
3.6%-16.2% without increasing stalling rate.

consider a single task in a single-cell wireless network, ignoring the impact
of inter-cell interference on learning performance. In this paper, we
investigate a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable
intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted over-the-air computation based vertical
FL system in multi-cell networks, in which a STAR-RIS is deployed at the cell
edge to facilitate the completion of different FL tasks in different cells. We
establish the convergence of the proposed system through theoretical analysis
and introduce the Pareto boundary of the optimality gaps to characterize the
trade-off among cells. Based on the analysis, we then jointly design the
transmit and receive beamforming as well as the STAR-RIS transmission and
reflection coefficient matrices to minimize the sum of the gaps of all cells.
To solve the non-convex resource allocation problem, we introduce a successive
convex approximation based algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that
compared with conventional approaches, the proposed STAR-RIS assisted vertical

logarithmic divergence of the bending energy of the orbital anisotropy axis at

the vector of the orbital anisotropy plays the role of the vector potential of

the spatial distribution of the order parameter in rotating $^3$He-A as a

observe formation of vortex skyrmions known as the double-quantum vortex and
the vortex sheet. These structures include alternating circular and hyperbolic

limited, making the rectangle instance feature mixed with a lot of
instance-irrelevant noise information. Besides, by counting the number of
instances with different degrees of overlap of CrowdHuman dataset, we find that
the number of severely overlapping objects and the number of slightly
overlapping objects are unbalanced, which may exacerbate the challenges posed
by occlusion issues. Regarding to the noise issue, from the perspective of
denoising, an iterable dynamic instance noise filter (DINF) is proposed for the
RCNN-based pedestrian detectors to improve the signal-noise ratio of the
instance feature. Simulating the wavelet denoising process, we use the instance
feature vector to generate dynamic convolutional kernels to transform the RoIs
features to a domain in which the near-zero values represent the noise

applied to convert the near-zero values to zero to filter out noise
information. For the imbalance issue, we propose an IoU-Focal factor (IFF) to
modulate the contributions of the well-regressed boxes and the bad-regressed
boxes to the loss in the training process, paying more attention to the
minority severely overlapping objects. Extensive experiments conducted on

and considerations for future work.
  Materials and Methods: The task used the Social History Annotated Corpus
(SHAC), which consists of clinical text with detailed event-based annotations
for SDOH events such as alcohol, drug, tobacco, employment, and living
situation. Each SDOH event is characterized through attributes related to
status, extent, and temporality. The task includes three subtasks related to

transfer (Subtask C). In addressing this task, participants utilized a range of
techniques, including rules, knowledge bases, n-grams, word embeddings, and
pretrained language models (LM).
  Results: A total of 15 teams participated, and the top teams utilized
pretrained deep learning LM. The top team across all subtasks used a
sequence-to-sequence approach achieving 0.901 F1 for Subtask A, 0.774 F1
Subtask B, and 0.889 F1 for Subtask C.
  Conclusions: Similar to many NLP tasks and domains, pretrained LM yielded the
best performance, including generalizability and learning transfer. An error
analysis indicates extraction performance varies by SDOH, with lower
performance achieved for conditions, like substance use and homelessness, that
increase health risks (risk factors) and higher performance achieved for
conditions, like substance abstinence and living with family, that reduce
health risks (protective factors).

subject to strict legal conditions. Still, many preclinical animal experiments
are only poorly designed. As a consequence, discoveries that are made in one
animal experiment, cannot be reproduced in another animal experiment or
discoveries in translational animal research fail to be translated to humans.
When designing new experiments in a classical frequentist framework, the sample
size for the new experiment is chosen with the goal to achieve at least a
certain statistical power, given a statistical test for a null hypothesis, a
significance threshold and a minimally relevant effect size. In a Bayesian
framework, inference is made by a combination of both the information from
newly observed data and also by a prior distribution, that represents a priori
information on the parameters. In translational animal experiments, a priori
information is present in previously conducted experiments to the same outcome
in similar animals. The prior information can be incorporated in a systematic
way in the design and analysis of a new animal experiment by summarizing the
historical data in a (Bayesian) meta-analysis model and using the meta-analysis
model to make predictions for the data in the new experiment. This is called
meta-analytic predictive (MAP) approach. In this work, concepts of how to
design translational animal experiments by MAP approaches are introduced and
compared to classical frequentist power-oriented sample size planning. Current
chances and challenges, that exist in the practical application of these
approaches in translational animal research, are discussed. Special emphasis is
put on the construction of prior distributions and sample size calculation by
design analysis. The considerations are motivated by a real world translational

electric fields in the framework of a weakly nonlinear theory. Elevation and
depression solitary waves with constant vorticity are computed by a
pseudo-spectral method and a parameter sweep on the intensity of the electric

points does not change significantly with variations of the electric field. For
depression solitary waves, on the other hand, the electric field acts as a
catalyser that makes possible the appearance of stagnation points - in the

cosmic dipole tension. At the crossroad of these, we investigate the impact of
peculiar velocities on estimations of the Hubble constant from time-delay
cosmography. We quantify the bias on the inference of the Hubble constant due
to peculiar velocities of the lens, the source and of the observer. The former
two, which may cancel from one system to another, affect the determination of
the angular diameter distances in the time-delay formula, and reconstructed
quantities like the angle to the source, via a lens model. On the other hand,
the peculiar velocity of the observer, which is a debated quantity in the
context of the cosmic dipole tension, systematically affects observed angles
through aberration, redshifts, angular diameter distance and reconstructed
quantities. We compute in detail the effect of these peculiar velocities on the
inference of the Hubble constant to linear order in the peculiar velocities for
the seven lenses of the H0LiCOW/TDCOSMO collaboration. The bias generated by
the observer's peculiar velocity alone can reach $1.15\%$ for the lenses which
are well aligned with it. This results in a $0.25 \%$ bias for the seven
combined lenses. Assuming a typical peculiar velocity of $300$ km s$^{-1}$ for
the lens and the source galaxies, these add an additional random uncertainty,
which can reach $1\%$ for an individual lens, but reduces to $0.24\%$ for the
full TDCOSMO sample. The picture may change if peculiar velocities turn out to
be larger than expected. Any time-delay cosmography program which aims for
percent precision on the Hubble constant may need to take this source of
systematic bias into account. This is especially so for future ground-based
surveys which cover a fraction of the celestial sphere that is well aligned

utilizes chemical signals in the form of molecules to exchange information
between spatially separated entities. Pulse shaping is an important process in
all communication systems, as it modifies the waveform of transmitted signals
to match the characteristics of the communication channel for reliable and
high-speed information transfer. In MC systems, the unconventional
architectures of components, such as transmitters and receivers, and the
complex, nonlinear, and time-varying nature of MC channels make pulse shaping
even more important. While several pulse shaping methods have been
theoretically proposed for MC, their practicality and performance are still
uncertain. Moreover, the majority of recently proposed experimental MC testbeds
that rely on microfluidics technology lack the incorporation of programmable
pulse shaping methods, which hinders the accurate evaluation of MC techniques
in practical settings. To address the challenges associated with pulse shaping
in microfluidic MC systems, we provide a comprehensive overview of practical
microfluidic chemical waveform generation techniques that have been
experimentally validated and whose architectures can inform the design of pulse
shaping methods for microfluidic MC systems and testbeds. These techniques
include those based on hydrodynamic and acoustofluidic force fields, as well as
electrochemical reactions. We also discuss the fundamental working mechanisms
and system architectures of these techniques, and compare their performances in
terms of spatiotemporal resolution, selectivity, system complexity, and other
performance metrics relevant to MC applications, as well as their feasibility
for practical MC applications.

contact angle $\pi-\theta_2$, where $\theta_2$ is the receding contact angle of
water on the patch material. This pinned macro-bubble serves as the initial
condition of a quasi-static growth process, \`a la Landau, leading to
detachment through the formation of a neck, so long as depinning and dewetting
of the hydrophilic matrix was avoided during the growth of the pinned bubble:
the bubble contact angle should not exceed $\pi-\theta_1$, where $\theta_1$ is
the receding contact angle of water on the matrix material. The boiling process
may then enter a cycle of macro-bubbles forming and detaching on the patches;
the radii of these patches can be optimized for maximizing the heat transfer
for a given substrate area. For this analysis to become quantitative, we
revisit the Young-Laplace quasi-static evolution of key physical quantities,
such as bubble energy, as functions of bubble growing volume, when gravity is
either significative or negligible: this concerns both pinned bubbles on a
fixed circular footprint (Dirichlet boundary conditions) and free un-pinned

are driven by fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs). They can accelerate SEPs up
to relativistic energies and are attributed to the largest SEP events. New
studies suggest that CME-driven shocks can potentially accelerate electrons to
MeV energies in the vicinity of the Sun. We focus on relativistic electrons
associated with strong IP shocks between 2007 and 2019 to determine whether the
shocks can keep accelerating such electrons up to 1 AU distance. We have
analyzed High Energy Telescope (HET) observations aboard the STEREO spacecraft
of potential electron energetic storm particle (ESP) events, characterized by
intensity time series that peak at the time of, or close to, the associated
CME-driven shock crossing. We present a new filtering method to assess the
statistical significance of particle intensity increases and apply it to MeV
electron observations in the vicinity of interplanetary shocks. We identified
27 candidate events by visual inspection from a STEREO in-situ shock list. Our
method identified nine clear cases, where a significant increase of MeV
electrons was found in association with a shock. Typically, the highest
statistical significance was observed in the highest HET energy channel of
electrons. All nine cases were associated with shocks driven by interplanetary
CMEs that showed large transit speeds, in excess of 900 km/s. In several cases
multiple shocks were observed within one day of the shock related to the
electron increase. Although electron ESP events at MeV energies are found to be
rare at 1 AU our filtering method is not designed to identify a potential
interplanetary shock contribution from distances closer to the Sun. Future
observations taken during closer approaches to the Sun will likely provide
clarity on interplanetary shock acceleration of electrons.

characterization of the Mott phase surprisingly related to the one of the
single-particle electronic dispersion. Considerations on the zeros lead to the
prediction of new phenomena: a topological Mott insulator with an inverted gap
for the bulk zeros must possess gapless zeros at the boundary, which behave as

implicit hydrofoil morphing via a polynomial perturbation of parametric level
set representation. Without introducing any change in topology, the hydrofoil
morphing is achieved by six shape design variables associated with the
amplitude and shape of the perturbed displacements. The proposed approach has
three to four times lower design variables than shape optimization via
free-form deformation techniques and almost two orders lower design variables
compared to topology optimization via traditional parametric level sets. Using
the fixed Cartesian level set mesh, we also integrate deep convolutional
encoder-decoder networks as a surrogate of high-fidelity Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations for learning the flow field around hydrofoil
shapes. We show that an efficient shape representation via parametric level
sets can enable online convolutional encoder-decoder application for the shape
optimization of hydrofoils. The generalized flow field prediction of the
convolutional encoder-decoder is demonstrated by a mean and minimum structural
similarity index measure of 0.985 and 0.95, respectively, for predicted
solutions compared to RANS predictions for out-of-training shapes. The
convolutional encoder-decoder predictions are performed nearly five orders of
magnitude faster compared to RANS. This enables a computationally tractable
surrogate-based drag minimization of fifty different hydrofoils for two
different design lift coefficients. Furthermore, the best local minimum
obtained via the surrogate-based optimization lie in the neighbourhood of the
RANS-predicted counterparts for both the design lift cases. The present
findings show promise for the future shape optimization via parametric level
sets with convolutional encoder-decoder over a broader spectrum of flow
conditions and shapes.

this paper, we proposed a GAN-based end-to-end signal transformation network
for data length extension, termed as TEGAN. TEGAN transforms short-length SSVEP
signals into long-length artificial SSVEP signals. By incorporating a novel
U-Net generator architecture and an auxiliary classifier into the network
architecture, the TEGAN could produce conditioned features in the synthetic

LeCam-divergence regularization term to regularize the training process of GAN

public SSVEP datasets (a 4-class dataset and a 12-class dataset). With the
assistance of TEGAN, the performance of traditional frequency recognition
methods and deep learning-based methods have been significantly improved under

frequency recognition methods has been narrowed. This study substantiates the
feasibility of the proposed method to extend the data length for short-time

  Motivated by the importance of data privacy, we develop differentially

of three telescopes: the two High Resolution Imagers in EUV (HRIEUV) and in
Lyman-{\alpha} (HRILya), and the Full Sun Imager (FSI). Solar Orbiter/EUI
started its Nominal Mission Phase on 2021 November 27. Aims. EUI images from
the largest scales in the extended corona off limb, down to the smallest
features at the base of the corona and chromosphere. EUI is therefore a key
instrument for the connection science that is at the heart of the Solar Orbiter
mission science goals. Methods. The highest resolution on the Sun is achieved
when Solar Orbiter passes through the perihelion part of its orbit. On 2022
March 26, Solar Orbiter reached for the first time a distance to the Sun close
to 0.3 au. No other coronal EUV imager has been this close to the Sun. Results.
We review the EUI data sets obtained during the period 2022 March-April, when
Solar Orbiter quickly moved from alignment with the Earth (2022 March 6), to
perihelion (2022 March 26), to quadrature with the Earth (2022 March 29). We
highlight the first observational results in these unique data sets and we
report on the in-flight instrument performance. Conclusions. EUI has obtained
the highest resolution images ever of the solar corona in the quiet Sun and
polar coronal holes. Several active regions were imaged at unprecedented
cadences and sequence durations. We identify in this paper a broad range of
features that require deeper studies. Both FSI and HRIEUV operate at design
specifications but HRILya suffered from performance issues near perihelion. We
conclude emphasising the EUI open data policy and encouraging further detailed
analysis of the events highlighted in this paper.

comparison of organismal anatomies begins by standardizing samples of
homologously labelled point configurations for location, orientation, and
scale, and then renders the ensuing comparisons graphically by thin-plate
spline as applied to group averages, principal components, regression
predictions, or canonical variates. The scale-standardization step has recently
come under criticism as inappropriate, at least for growth studies. This essay
argues for a similar rethinking of the centering and rotation, and then the
replacement of the thin-plate spline interpolant of the resulting
configurations by a different strategy that leaves unexplained residuals at
every landmark individually in order to simplify the interpretation of the
displayed grid as a whole, the ""transformation grid"" that has been highlighted
as the true underlying topic ever since D'Arcy Thompson's exposition of 1917.
  For analyses of comparisons involving gradients at large geometric scale,
this paper argues for replacement of all the Procrustes conventions by a
version of my two-point registration of 1986 (originally Francis Galton's of
1907). The choice of the two points interacts with another non-Procrustes
concern, interpretability of the grid lines of a coordinate system deformed
according to a fitted polynomial trend rather than an interpolating thin-plate
spline.
  The paper works two examples using previously published cranial data; there
result new findings pertinent to the interpretation of both of these classic
data sets.
  A concluding discussion suggests that the current toolkit of geometric
morphometrics, centered on Procrustes shape coordinates and thin-plate splines,
is too restricted to suit many of the interpretive purposes of evolutionary and
developmental biology.

We seek to encapsulate polarization behaviour on a population scale by defining
broad categories for frequency- and phase-dependent polarization evolution,
studying the co-occurrences of these categorizations and comparing them with
average polarization measurements and spin-down energy ($\dot{E}$). This work
shows that deviations of the linear polarization position angle (PA) from the
rotating vector model (RVM) are linked to the presence of circular polarization
features and to frequency evolution of the polarization. Polarization fraction,
circular polarization contribution and profile complexity all evolve with
$\dot{E}$ across the population, with the profiles of high-$\dot{E}$ pulsars
being simple and highly linearly polarized. The relationship between
polarization fraction and circular contribution is also seen to evolve such
that highly polarized profiles show less variation in circular contribution
with frequency than less strongly polarized profiles. This evolution is seen
both across the population and across frequency for individual sources.
Understanding pulsar radio polarization requires detailed study of individual
sources and collective understanding of population-level trends. For the
former, we provide visualizations of their phase- and frequency-resolved
polarization parameters. For the latter, we have highlighted the importance of

cosmological contexts. We show that in the geometric optics approximation, the
corresponding particles move along geodesics and contribute with the same
active mass (energy) to the gravitational field as in Diff invariant theories.
However, for low-frequency modes, the contributions to the energy-momentum
tensor differ from that of Diff invariant theories. This opens up a wide range
of possibilities for cosmological model building. As an example, we show that
the simplest TDiff invariant scalar field theory with only kinetic term could
drive inflation and generate a red-tilted spectrum of density fluctuations. We
also present a detailed analysis of cosmological perturbations and show that
the breaking of full Diff invariance generically induces new non-adiabatic
pressure perturbations. A simple scalar field dark matter model based on a
purely kinetic term that exhibits the same clustering properties as standard
cold dark matter is also presented.

neuropsychiatric conditions. However, most studies only compare a single
clinical group to healthy controls, whereas clinical practice often requires
differentiating between multiple potential diagnoses (multiclass settings). To
address this, we assembled a dataset of repeated recordings from 420
participants (67 with major depressive disorder, 106 with schizophrenia and 46
with autism, as well as matched controls), and tested the performance of a
range of conventional machine learning models and advanced Transformer models
on both binary and multiclass classification, based on voice and text features.
  While binary models performed comparably to previous research (F1 scores
between 0.54-0.75 for autism spectrum disorder, ASD; 0.67-0.92 for major
depressive disorder, MDD; and 0.71-0.83 for schizophrenia); when
differentiating between multiple diagnostic groups performance decreased
markedly (F1 scores between 0.35-0.44 for ASD, 0.57-0.75 for MDD, 0.15-0.66 for
schizophrenia, and 0.38-0.52 macro F1). Combining voice and text-based models
yielded increased performance, suggesting that they capture complementary
diagnostic information.
  Our results indicate that models trained on binary classification may learn
to rely on markers of generic differences between clinical and non-clinical
populations, or markers of clinical features that overlap across conditions,
rather than identifying markers specific to individual conditions. We provide
recommendations for future research in the field, suggesting increased focus on
developing larger transdiagnostic datasets that include more fine-grained
clinical features, and that can support the development of models that better
capture the complexity of neuropsychiatric conditions and naturalistic
diagnostic assessment.

Previous studies are known to suffer from flux losses in the most extended

resulting combined maps are expected to detect the whole nebula extent of the
source. Our new combined maps contain the entirety of the detectable flux of
the source and at the same time are of high spatial resolution thanks to the
interferometric observations. We find that the hourglass-like extended outflow
around the rotating disk is larger and more massive than suggested by previous
works. The total nebular mass of this very extended nebula is 1.8E-2 solar
masses, of which 65% comes from the outflow. The observational data and model
results lead us to classify the envelope around 89 Her as an outflow-dominated
nebula, together with R Sct and IRAS 19125+0343 (and very probably AI CMi, IRAS

accelerators' energy efficiency by introducing inexactness with a tolerable
accuracy loss. However, small accuracy variations may increase the sensitivity
of these accelerators towards undesired subtle disturbances, such as permanent
faults. The impact of permanent faults in accurate deep neural network (AccDNN)
accelerators has been thoroughly investigated in the literature. Conversely,
the impact of permanent faults and their mitigation in approximate DNN (AxDNN)
accelerators is vastly under-explored. Towards this, we first present an
extensive fault resilience analysis of approximate multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using the state-of-the-art
Evoapprox8b multipliers in GPU and TPU accelerators. Then, we propose a novel
fault mitigation method, i.e., fault-aware retuning of weights (Fal-reTune).
Fal-reTune retunes the weights using a weight mapping function in the presence
of faults for improved classification accuracy. To evaluate the fault
resilience and the effectiveness of our proposed mitigation method, we used the
most widely used MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. Our results
demonstrate that the permanent faults exacerbate the accuracy loss in AxDNNs
compared to the AccDNN accelerators. For instance, a permanent fault in AxDNNs
can lead to 56\% accuracy loss, whereas the same faulty bit can lead to only
4\% accuracy loss in AccDNN accelerators. We empirically show that our proposed
Fal-reTune mitigation method improves the performance of AxDNNs up to 98%, even
with fault rates of up to 50%. Furthermore, we observe that the fault
resilience in AxDNNs is orthogonal to their energy efficiency.

from wearable sensor data. Biobehavioral rhythms were modeled using nine
parameters (mesor, amplitude, acrophase, and intra-daily variability). These
features were then input to CovidRhythm for predicting Covid-19 in the
incubation phase (one day before biological symptoms manifest). A combination
of sensor and biobehavioral rhythm features achieved the highest AUC-ROC of
0.79 [Sensitivity = 0.69, Specificity=0.89, F$_{0.1}$ = 0.76], outperforming

interpretation of de Sitter space (i.e., the space curved in the presence of
$\lambda$). According to that interpretation, the curvature is produced by a
cosmological vacuum (now identified as dark energy of the universe). In 1970,
Gliner proposed a description of exponential expansion (or contraction) of the
universe at the early (or late) evolution stage dominated by cosmological
vacuum. In 1975, Gliner (with I.G. Dyminikova) suggested a model of the early
universe free of Big Bang singularity, and developed a scenario of nonsingular
Friedmann cosmology. Many of these findings were used in the modern inflation
scenarios of the universe, first proposed by A.A. Starobinsky (1979) and A.

contains unique BAs. However, a fundamental question remains unsolved to-date
regarding the convexity of the CS in infinite NLS known as the CS problem. The
question which has not been answered is: Is every CS in a NLS convex?. This
question has not got any solution including the simplest form of a real Hilbert
space (HS). In this note, we characterize CSs and convexity in NLSs. In
particular, we consider the space of all real-valued norm-attainable functions.
We show that CSs of the space of all real-valued norm-attainable functions are
convex when they are closed, rotund and admits both Gateaux and Fr\'{e}chet
differentiability conditions.

naive theory of a perturbation on a probability using wavelets, such as a noise
perturbs the signal of a digital image sensor. The cumulative wavelet integral
function is defined and builds up the perturbations with the help of this
function. We show that an arbitrary distribution function additively perturbed
is still a distribution function, which can be seen as a privatized
distribution, with the privatization mechanism being a wavelet function. It is
shown that an arbitrary cumulative distribution function added to such an
additive perturbation is still a cumulative distribution function. Thus, we
offer a mathematical method for choosing a suitable probability distribution to
data by starting from some guessed initial distribution. The areas of
artificial intelligence and machine learning are constantly in need of data
fitting techniques, closely related to sensors. The proposed privatization
mechanism is therefore a contribution to increasing the scope of existing
techniques.

traditionally requires a large investment of time and resources. Experiments
can be expensive and are hence conducted on relatively small scales. This poses
problems for typically data-hungry machine learning tools which could otherwise
expedite the development cycle. We build upon prior work by applying
conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) to scanning electron
microscope (SEM) imagery from an emerging manufacturing process, shear assisted
processing and extrusion (ShAPE). We generate realistic images conditioned on
temper and either experimental parameters or material properties. In doing so,
we are able to integrate machine learning into the development cycle, by
allowing a user to immediately visualize the microstructure that would arise
from particular process parameters or properties. This work forms a technical
backbone for a fundamentally new approach for understanding manufacturing
processes in the absence of first-principle models. By characterizing
microstructure from a topological perspective we are able to evaluate our
models' ability to capture the breadth and diversity of experimental scanning
electron microscope (SEM) samples. Our method is successful in capturing the
visual and general microstructural features arising from the considered
process, with analysis highlighting directions to further improve the
topological realism of our synthetic imagery.

continuous user authentication service through behaviour captured by a
touchscreen. While efforts are made to advance touch-based behavioural
authentication, researchers often focus on gathering data, tuning classifiers,
and enhancing performance by evaluating touch interactions in a sequence rather
than independently. However, such systems only work by providing data
representing distinct behavioural traits. The typical approach separates
behaviour into touch directions and creates multiple user profiles. This work
presents an omnidirectional approach which outperforms the traditional method
independent of the touch direction - depending on optimal behavioural features
and a balanced training set. Thus, we evaluate five behavioural feature sets
using the conventional approach against our direction-agnostic method while
testing several classifiers, including an Extra-Tree and Gradient Boosting
Classifier, which is often overlooked. Results show that in comparison with the
traditional, an Extra-Trees classifier and the proposed approach are superior
when combining strokes. However, the performance depends on the applied feature
set. We find that the TouchAlytics feature set outperforms others when using
our approach when combining three or more strokes. Finally, we highlight the
importance of reporting the mean area under the curve and equal error rate for
single-stroke performance and varying the sequence of strokes separately.

brain tissues is key to diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its subtypes.
Recently, deep learning (DL) models such as UNet have been successfully used
for automatic segmentation of histopathological whole slide images (WSI) of
biological tissues. In this study, we propose a DL-based methodology for
semantic segmentation of tau lesions (i.e., neuritic plaques) in WSI of
postmortem patients with AD. The state of the art in semantic segmentation of
neuritic plaques in human WSI is very limited. Our study proposes a baseline
able to generate a significant advantage for morphological analysis of these
tauopathies for further stratification of AD patients. Essential discussions
concerning biomarkers (ALZ50 versus AT8 tau antibodies), the imaging modality
(different slide scanner resolutions), and the challenge of weak annotations
are addressed within this seminal study. The analysis of the impact of context
in plaque segmentation is important to understand the role of the
micro-environment for reliable tau protein segmentation. In addition, by
integrating visual interpretability, we are able to explain how the network
focuses on a region of interest (ROI), giving additional insights to
pathologists. Finally, the release of a new expert-annotated database and the
code (\url{https://github.com/aramis-lab/miccai2022-stratifiad.git}) will be
helpful for the scientific community to accelerate the development of new
pipelines for human WSI processing in AD.

often in a qualitative way or by theoretical approaches. The aim of this study
is to test physical concepts with empirical data. For this purpose, a
ventilation model has been built and compared with field temperature and air
velocity measurements in the Milandre Cave Laboratory (Switzerland). The model
explains about 95% of the measured airflow thus confirming the major role of
temperature on the air dynamics. However, these first results also reveal that
the measured winter air flow is lower than predicted by the model and that the
air flow reversal occurs at a lower temperature than anticipated. Combined with
a forced ventilation experiment these results underline the influence of the
atmospheric composition (particularly the water vapor and concentration in
CO$_2$ and O$_2$), waterflow rates and network geometry on the air flow. This
work paves the way for a better quantification of heat and mass fluxes in
relation to underground ventilation.

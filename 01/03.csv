risk, which poses challenges for their safe and ethical release to the public.
Differentially private stochastic gradient descent is the de facto standard for
training neural networks without leaking sensitive information about the
training data. However, applying it to models for graph-structured data poses a
novel challenge: unlike with i.i.d. data, sensitive information about a node in
a graph cannot only leak through its gradients, but also through the gradients
of all nodes within a larger neighborhood. In practice, this limits
privacy-preserving deep learning on graphs to very shallow graph neural
networks. We propose to solve this issue by training graph neural networks on
disjoint subgraphs of a given training graph. We develop three
random-walk-based methods for generating such disjoint subgraphs and perform a
careful analysis of the data-generating distributions to provide strong privacy
guarantees. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method greatly
outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline on three large graphs, and matches or

the distribution calibration technique which utilizes the distribution or

regions of shocked molecular gas. A recently published $K$-band spectrum of
Herbig-Haro 7 (HH7) contains several vibration-rotation lines of H2 from highly
excited energy levels that have not been detected elsewhere, including a line
at 2.179 $\mu$m identified as arising from the $v$=2 $J$=29 level, which lies
above the dissociation limit of H2. One emission line at 2.104 $\mu$m in this
spectrum was unidentified.
  Aims. We aim to complete the analysis of the spectrum of HH7 by including
previously missing molecular data that have been recently computed. Methods. We
re-analysed the $K$-band spectrum, emphasising the physics of quasi-bound upper
levels that can produce infrared emission lines in the $K$ band.
  Results. We confirm the identification of the $2-1$ $S$(27) line at 2.1785
$\mu$m and identify the line at 2.1042 $\mu$m as due to the 1-0 $S$(29)
transition of H2, whose upper level energy is also higher than the dissociation
limit. This latter identification, its column density, and the energy of its
upper level further substantiate the existence of a hot thermal component at
5000 K in the HH7 environment.}
  Conclusion. The presence of the newly identified $1-0$ $S$(29) line, whose
quasi-bound upper level ($v$=1, $J$=31) has a significant spontaneous
dissociation probability, shows that dissociation of H2 is occurring. The
mechanism by which virtually all of the H2 levels with energies from 20,000 K
to 53,000 K is maintained in local thermodynamic equilibrium at a single
temperature of $\sim$5,000 K remains to be understood.

low-extinction outflow cavities greatly affect the appearance of a protostar by
allowing the escape of shorter wavelength photons. Doppler-shifted CO line
emission from outflows is also often the most prominent manifestation of deeply
embedded early-stage star formation. Here, we present 3D magneto-hydrodynamic
simulations of a disk wind outflow from a protostar forming from an initially
$60\:M_\odot$ core embedded in a high pressure environment typical of massive
star-forming regions. We simulate the growth of the protostar from
$m_*=1\:M_\odot$ to $26\:M_\odot$ over a period of $\sim$100,000 years. The
outflow quickly excavates a cavity with half opening angle of $\sim10^\circ$
through the core. This angle remains relatively constant until the star reaches
$4\:M_\odot$. It then grows steadily in time, reaching a value of $\sim
50^\circ$ by the end of the simulation. We estimate a lower limit to the star
formation efficiency (SFE) of 0.43. However, accounting for continued accretion
from a massive disk and residual infall envelope, we estimate that the final
SFE may be as high as $\sim0.7$. We examine observable properties of the
outflow, especially the evolution of the cavity opening angle, total mass and
momentum flux, and velocity distributions of the outflowing gas, and compare

quite popular. A convenient way for extending stylization techniques to videos
is by applying them on a per-frame basis. However, such per-frame application
usually lacks temporal-consistency expressed by undesirable flickering
artifacts. Most of the existing approaches for enforcing temporal-consistency
suffers from one or more of the following drawbacks. They (1) are only suitable
for a limited range of stylization techniques, (2) can only be applied in an
offline fashion requiring the complete video as input, (3) cannot provide
consistency for the task of stylization, or (4) do not provide interactive
consistency-control. Note that existing consistent video-filtering approaches
aim to completely remove flickering artifacts and thus do not respect any
specific consistency-control aspect. For stylization tasks, however,
consistency-control is an essential requirement where a certain amount of
flickering can add to the artistic look and feel. Moreover, making this control
interactive is paramount from a usability perspective. To achieve the above
requirements, we propose an approach that can stylize video streams while
providing interactive consistency-control. Apart from stylization, our approach
also supports various other image processing filters. For achieving interactive
performance, we develop a lite optical-flow network that operates at 80 Frames

final consistent video-output using our flow network is comparable to that
being obtained using state-of-the-art optical-flow network. Further, we employ
an adaptive combination of local and global consistent features and enable
interactive selection between the two. By objective and subjective evaluation,
we show that our method is superior to state-of-the-art approaches.

recently, power laws have also been observed in neural populations in the mouse

the neural activity being coupled to multiple latent dynamical variables. An
intriguing possibility is that avalanche criticality emerges due to a similar
mechanism. Here, we determine the conditions under which dynamical latent
variables give rise to avalanche criticality. We find that a single,
quasi-static latent variable can generate critical avalanches, but that
multiple latent variables lead to critical behavior in a broader parameter
range. We identify two regimes of avalanches, both of which are critical, but
differ in the amount of information carried about the latent variable. Our
results suggest that avalanche criticality arises in neural systems in which
there is an emergent dynamical variable or shared inputs creating an effective
latent dynamical variable, and when this variable can be inferred from the

investigated. The majority of these algorithms are however intrusive in the
sense that the High-Fidelity (HF) code must be modified. To address this issue,
non-intrusive strategies are employed. The NIRB two-grid method uses the HF
code solely as a ``black-box'', requiring no code modification. Like other
RBMs, it is based on an offline-online decomposition. The offline stage is
time-consuming, but it is only executed once, whereas the online stage is
significantly less expensive than an HF evaluation. In this paper, we propose
new NIRB two-grid algorithms for both the direct and adjoint state methods. On

that HF evaluations of sensitivities reach an optimal convergence rate in
$L^{\infty}(0,T;H^1(\Omega))$, and then establish that these rates are
recovered by the proposed NIRB approximation. These results are supported by

study focused on the saturation packing of squares and their dimers, trimers,
tetramers, pentamers, and hexamers, all of which were orientated in two
randomly chosen orientations (vertical and horizontal). Our results concurred
with those of previous extrapolation-based research1. We used the ""separating

overlapped. When RSA insertion became disproportionately sluggish, we concluded
that saturation had been attained. We also discovered that the system's
capacity to fill the area decreased as squares were stretched into dimers and
trimmers. The microstructure of the resultant saturation was also thoroughly
investigated, including block function and the structural arrangement of dimers
and trimers. Based on results of ref2, it is predicted that layer adsorbed onto
a substrate will not hinder diffusion. Moreover, it was found that the adsorbed
rectangles' aspect ratio had an impact on the coverage percentage at the
jamming limit, with aspect ratios of 2 (like dimers here) producing the highest
jamming coverage. As a result, the current results are a more in-depth

layer of compressible, barotropic, viscous fluid, modeled by the free boundary
compressible Navier-Stokes equations in dimension $n \ge 2$. The bottom
boundary of the fluid is flat and rigid, while the top is a moving free
boundary. A constant gravitational field acts normal to the flat bottom. We
allow external forces to act in the fluid's bulk and external stresses to act
on its free surface. These are posited to be in traveling wave form, i.e.
time-independent when viewed in a coordinate system moving at a constant,
nontrivial velocity parallel to the lower rigid boundary.
  In the absence of such external sources of stress and force, the fluid system
reverts to equilibrium, which corresponds to a flat, quiescent fluid layer with
vertically stratified density. In contrast, when such sources of stress or
force are present, the system admits traveling wave solutions. We establish a
small data well-posedness theory for this problem by proving that for every
nontrivial traveling wave speed there exists a nonempty open set of stress and
forcing data that give rise to unique traveling wave solutions, and that these
solutions depend continuously on the data and the wave speed. When $n \ge 3$ we
prove this with surface tension accounted for at the free boundary, while in

reinterpreting the oscillators as particles moving on the surface of unit
spheres in a D-dimensional space. Each particle is then represented by a
D-dimensional unit vector. For $D=2$ the particles move on the unit circle and
the vectors can be described by a single phase, recovering the original
Kuramoto model. This multidimensional description can be further extended by
promoting the coupling constant between the particles to a matrix that acts on
the unit vectors, representing a type of generalized frustration. In a recent
paper we have analyzed in detail the role of the coupling matrix for $D=2$.
Here we extend this analysis to arbitrary dimensions, presenting a study of
synchronous states and their stability. We show that when the natural
frequencies of the particles are set to zero, the system converges either to a
stationary synchronized state with well defined phase, or to an effective
two-dimensional dynamics, where the synchronized particles rotate on the
sphere. The stability of these states depend on the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of the coupling matrix. When the natural frequencies are not zero,
synchronization depends on whether $D$ is even or odd. In even dimensions the
transition to synchronization is continuous and rotating states are replaced by
active states, where the order parameter rotates while its module oscillates.
If $D$ is odd the phase transition is discontinuous and active states are
suppressed, occurring only for a restricted class of coupling matrices.

Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) is an efficient tool to fuse empirical

various information sources, we propose a model fusion scheme based on PINN. It
is implemented by developing a semi-empirical semi-physical Partial

leverage the data-driven Deep Hidden Physics Model (DeepHPM) to discover the

fused with that mined by the surrogate neural network in the PINN framework.
Moreover, an uncertainty-based adaptive weighting method is employed to balance

force at large scales towards the small scales. In hydrodynamic turbulence,
when the Reynolds number is large, the velocity field of the fluid becomes
irregular and the rate of energy dissipation remains bounded from below even if
the fluid viscosity tends to zero. A mathematical description of the turbulent
cascade is a very active research topic since the pioneering work of Kolmogorov
in hydrodynamic turbulence and that of Zakharov in wave turbulence. In both
cases, these turbulent cascade mechanisms imply power-law behaviors of several
statistical quantities such as power spectral densities. For a long time, these
cascades were believed to be associated with nonlinear interactions, but recent
works have shown that they can also take place in a dynamics governed by a
linear equation with a differential operator of degree 0. In this spirit, we
construct a linear equation that mimics the phenomenology of energy cascades
when the external force is a statistically homogeneous and stationary
stochastic process. In the Fourier variable, this equation can be seen as a
linear transport equation, which corresponds to an operator of degree 0 in
physical space. Our results give a complete characterization of the solution:
it is smooth at any finite time, and, up to smaller order corrections, it
converges to a fractional Gaussian field at infinite time.

Here, the input data is a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra $H$, its comodule

Considering tensor products of evaluation representations of $H$ in

fused K-operators of spin-$j$; in particular, to prove that for all

Independently, we study K-operator solutions of the twisted intertwining
relations associated with the comodule algebra ${\cal A}_q$, and expand them in
the Poincar\'e-Birkhoff-Witt basis. With a reasonably general ansatz, we found
a unique solution for first few values of $j$ which agrees with the fused

Humans process that information through imperfect cognitive instruments that

To address these questions quantitatively, we analyze J. S. Bach's music
through the lens of network science and information theory. Regarded as one of
the greatest composers in the Western music tradition, Bach's work is highly
mathematically structured and spans a wide range of compositional forms, such
as fugues and choral pieces. Conceptualizing each composition as a network of
note transitions, we quantify the information contained in each piece and find
that different kinds of compositions can be grouped together according to their
information content. Moreover, we find that Bach's music is structured for
efficient communication; that is, it communicates large amounts of information
while maintaining small deviations of the inferred network from reality. We
probe the network structures that enable this rapid and efficient communication
of information -- namely, high heterogeneity and strong clustering. Taken
together, our findings shed new light on the information and network properties
of Bach's compositions. More generally, we gain insight into features that make
networks of information effective for communication.

Additionally, the Universal Model is computationally more efficient (6x faster)

these behaviors still exist when words are randomly shuffled. This proves that
the frequency-based effect observed in unshuffled corpora stems from properties

problematic since bias metrics should depend exclusively on word co-occurrences

However, multivariate tabular data pose different challenges in representation

learning tabular data in contrast to image data and present a novel Gaussian
Cluster Embedding in Autoencoder Latent Space (G-CEALS) algorithm by replacing

the proposed approach independently defines the Gaussian embedding and the

representation learning. A trained G-CEALS model extracts a quality embedding
for unseen test data. Based on the embedding clustering accuracy, the average
rank of the proposed G-CEALS method is 1.4 (0.7), which is superior to all
eight baseline clustering and cluster embedding methods on seven tabular data
sets. This paper shows one of the first algorithms to jointly learn embedding

The nonlocal model involves an integral over the range measured by a horizon

nonlocal horizon parameter goes to zero. Good numerical schemes for simulating
these parameterized nonlocal traffic flow models should be robust with respect
to the change of the model parameters but this has not been systematically
investigated in the literature. We fill this gap through a careful study of a
class of finite volume numerical schemes with suitable discretizations of the
nonlocal integral, which include several schemes proposed in the literature and
their variants. Our main contributions are to demonstrate the asymptotically
compatibility of the schemes, which includes both the uniform convergence of
the numerical solutions to the unique solution of nonlocal continuum model for
a given positive horizon parameter and the convergence to the unique entropy
solution of the local model as the mesh size and the nonlocal horizon parameter
go to zero simultaneously. It is shown that with the asymptotically
compatibility, the schemes can provide robust numerical computation under the
changes of the nonlocal horizon parameter.

state directly as input, they need to both learn a representation for what
matters in the task -- the task ``features"" -- as well as how to combine these
features into a single objective. If they try to do both at once from input
designed to teach the full reward function, it is easy to end up with a
representation that contains spurious correlations in the data, which fails to
generalize to new settings. Instead, our ultimate goal is to enable robots to
identify and isolate the causal features that people actually care about and
use when they represent states and behavior. Our idea is that we can tune into
this representation by asking users what behaviors they consider similar:
behaviors will be similar if the features that matter are similar, even if
low-level behavior is different; conversely, behaviors will be different if
even one of the features that matter differs. This, in turn, is what enables
the robot to disambiguate between what needs to go into the representation
versus what is spurious, as well as what aspects of behavior can be compressed
together versus not. The notion of learning representations based on similarity
has a nice parallel in contrastive learning, a self-supervised representation
learning technique that maps visually similar data points to similar
embeddings, where similarity is defined by a designer through data augmentation
heuristics. By contrast, in order to learn the representations that people use,
so we can learn their preferences and objectives, we use their definition of
similarity. In simulation as well as in a user study, we show that learning
through such similarity queries leads to representations that, while far from
perfect, are indeed more generalizable than self-supervised and task-input
alternatives.

such rectification is generically possible and clarifying previous statements

Usually, these two tasks are performed separately. For topic extraction to
facilitate clustering, we can first project texts into a topic space and then
perform a clustering algorithm to obtain clusters. To promote topic extraction
by clustering, we can first obtain clusters with a clustering algorithm and
then extract cluster-specific topics. However, this naive strategy ignores the
fact that text clustering and topic extraction are strongly correlated and
follow a chicken-and-egg relationship. Performing them separately fails to make
them mutually benefit each other to achieve the best overall performance. In
this paper, we propose an unsupervised text clustering and topic extraction
framework (ClusTop) which integrates text clustering and topic extraction into
a unified framework and can achieve high-quality clustering result and extract
topics from each cluster simultaneously. Our framework includes four
components: enhanced language model training, dimensionality reduction,
clustering and topic extraction, where the enhanced language model can be
viewed as a bridge between clustering and topic extraction. On one hand, it
provides text embeddings with a strong cluster structure which facilitates
effective text clustering; on the other hand, it pays high attention on the
topic related words for topic extraction because of its self-attention

unsupervised. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our

stochastic neighborhood embedding (t-SNE), a machine learning algorithm for
dimensionality reduction, to classify all Swift gamma-ray bursts as short or
long. Here, the method is expanded, using two algorithms, t-SNE and UMAP, to
produce embeddings that are used to provide a classification for the 1911 BATSE
bursts, 1321 Swift bursts, and 2294 Fermi bursts for which both spectra and
metadata are available. Although the embeddings appear to produce a clear
separation of each catalog into short and long bursts, a resampling-based
approach is used to show that a small fraction of bursts cannot be robustly
classified. Further, 3 of the 304 bursts observed by both Swift and Fermi have
robust but conflicting classifications. A likely interpretation is that in
addition to the two predominant classes of GRBs, there are additional, uncommon
types of bursts which may require multi-wavelength observations in order to

aims to offer a solution to this dilemma by empowering individuals to manage
their digital identity through machine-verifiable attestations stored in a

a relying party, these attestations typically reveal more attributes than
required and allow tracking end users' activities. Several academic works and
practical solutions exist to reduce or avoid such excessive information

the SSI solutions that are currently built with anonymous credentials still
lack essential features such as scalable revocation, certificate chaining, and
integration with secure elements. We then argue that general-purpose ZKPs in

describe our implementation and conduct performance tests on different edge

the Narrow Field Mode (NFM) of the MUSE instrument on board the Very Large
Telescope (VLT). The NFM observations provide a spatial resolution of
$\sim$0.1"", corresponding to a physical scale of $\sim$2 pc, one of the highest
spatial resolution achievable using ground-based AO-assisted observations in
the optical wavelengths. The MUSE observations reveal a collimated clumpy
outflow profile originating near the AGN location and extending up to 1.5""
($\sim$30 pc) in the NW direction. The collimated structure then fragments into
two filaments, giving the entire outflowing gas a ``tuning-fork'' morphology.
These structures remain undetected in the lower spatial resolution MUSE Wide
Field Mode data. We explain the origin of this tuning-fork structure to the
interaction of the outflow with a dense clump in the interstellar medium (ISM)
as the outflow propagates outward. The origin of the collimated structure
itself could be from jet-ISM interactions on small scales. These observations
also provide evidence to the origin of the ionised gas filaments previously
observed in the Circinus galaxy out to kiloparsec scales. We find instantaneous
and time-averaged mass outflow rates of 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and
10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively. Based on the star formation rate
in the Circinus galaxy reported in the literature, the observed ionised
outflows are not expected to regulate star formation within the $\sim$100 pc
scales probed by the NFM data.

Buchdahl's theorem sets an upper bound on compactness, further no-go results
rely on the existence of two light rings, the inner of which has been
associated to gravitational instabilities. However, little is known about the
role of quantum fields in these strong gravity regimes. Working in the probe
approximation where the backreaction is ignored, we show that the trapping of
modes around the inner light ring leads the renormalized stress tensor of
Conformal Field Theories to diverge faster than the classical source in the
Buchdahl limit. This leads to the violation of the Null Energy Condition, as
well as the isotropy assumption used in Buchdahl's theorem. The backreaction of
quantum fields in this regime therefore cannot be ignored. This happens as the
star's surface approaches the Buchdahl radius $9GM/4$ rather than the
Schwarzschild radius, with the quantum fields having support in a small region
around the center, becoming negligible at the surface. These are generic
quantum features and do not depend on the details of the interactions. Our
findings open a way for further investigation into the role of QFT in
astrophysics.

increasing the background LW field strength increases the average halo mass
required for star formation, we perform follow-up simulations of selected halos
to investigate the knock-on effects this has on the Population III IMF. We
follow 5 halos for each of the $J_{21}$ = 0, 0.01 and 0.1 LW field strengths,
resolving the pre-stellar core density of $10^{-6}$ g cm$^{-3}$ (10$^{18}$

behaviour for hundreds of years further. We find that the mass accreted onto
sinks by the end of the simulations is proportional to the mass within the
$\sim 10^{-2}$ pc molecular core, which is not correlated to the initial mass
of the halo. As such, the IMFs for masses above the brown dwarf limit show
little dependence on the LW strength, although they do show variance in the
number of low-mass clumps formed. As the range of background LW field strengths
tested here covers the most likely values from literature, we conclude that the
IMF for so-called Pop III.2 stars is not significantly different from the
initial population of Pop III.1 stars. The primordial IMF therefore likely
remains unchanged until the formation of the next generation of Population II

J0607-4448 (SPT0607), which is one of the most distant clusters discovered by
the South Pole Telescope (SPT) at $z=1.4010\pm0.0028$. The high-redshift
cluster shows clear signs of being relaxed with well-regulated feedback from
the active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). Using
Chandra X-ray data, we construct thermodynamic profiles and determine the
properties of the intracluster medium. The cool core nature of the cluster is
supported by a centrally-peaked density profile and low central entropy
($K_0=18_{-9}^{+11}$ keV cm$^2$), which we estimate assuming an isothermal
temperature profile due to the limited spectral information given the distance
to the cluster. Using the density profile and gas cooling time inferred from
the X-ray data, we find a mass cooling rate of
$\dot{M}_\mathrm{cool}=100_{-60}^{+90}~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. From optical
spectroscopy and photometry around the [O II] emission line, we estimate that
the BCG star formation rate is SFR$_\mathrm{[O~II]}=1.7_{-0.6}^{+1.0}~M_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$, roughly two orders of magnitude lower than the predicted mass
cooling rate. In addition, using ATCA radio data at 2.1 GHz, we measure a radio
jet power of $P_\mathrm{cav}=3.2_{-1.3}^{+2.1}\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$,
which is consistent with the X-ray cooling luminosity
($L_\mathrm{cool}=1.9_{-0.5}^{+0.2}\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ within
$r_\mathrm{cool}=43$ kpc). These findings suggest that SPT0607 is a relaxed,
cool core cluster with AGN-regulated cooling at an epoch shortly after cluster
formation, implying that the balance between cooling and feedback can be
reached quickly. We discuss implications for these findings on the evolution of
AGN feedback in galaxy clusters.

for semilinear Neumann elliptic equation with the critical and subcritical
polynomial nonlinearity, much less is known if the polynomial nonlinearity is
replaced by the exponential nonlinearity. In this paper, we consider the
following semilinear Neumann elliptic problem with the Trudinger-Moser
exponential growth: \begin{equation*}\begin{cases} -d\Delta
u_d+u_d=u_d(e^{u^2_{d}}-1)\ \ \mbox{in}\ \Omega,\\ \frac{\partial

$\Omega$ is a smooth bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$, $\nu$ is the unit outer
normal to $\partial \Omega$. We first prove the existence of a ground state
solution to the above equation. If $d$ is sufficiently small, we prove that any
ground state solution $u_d$ has at most one maximum point which is located on
the boundary of $\Omega$ and characterize the shape of ground state solution
$u_d$ around the condensation point $P_d$. The key point of the proof lies in
proving that the maximum point $P_d$ is close to the boundary at the speed of
$\sqrt{d}$ when $d\rightarrow0$ and $u_d$ under suitable scaling transform
converges strongly to the ground state solution of the limit equation $\Delta
w+w=w(e^{w^2}-1)$.
  Our proof is based on the energy threshold of cut-off function, the
concentration compactness principle for the
  Trudinger-Moser inequality, regularity theory for elliptic equation and an
accurate analysis for the energy of the ground state solution $u_d$ as
$d\rightarrow0$. Furthermore, by assuming that $\Omega$ is a unit disk, we
remove the smallness assumption on $d$ and show the maximum point of ground

subsequent assessment of their integrability or superintegrability in a

along these lines for second order autonomous dynamical systems is the
so-called direct method. According to this method, one assumes a general
functional form for the FI I and requires the condition dI/dt=0 along the
dynamical equations. This results to a system of partial differential equations
(PDEs) to which one adds the necessary integrability conditions of the involved
scalar quantities. It is found that the final system of PDEs breaks into two
sets: a. One set containing geometric elements only and b. A second set with
geometric and dynamical quantities. Then, provided the geometric quantities are
known or can be found, one uses the second set to compute the FIs and,
accordingly, assess on the integrability of the dynamical system. The solution
of the system of PDEs for quadratic FIs (QFIs) has been given in a recent paper

application of this solution to Newtonian autonomous conservative dynamical

the inference attack, we quantify how $\epsilon$ affects the estimation of the

consider varying privacy preferences among users and quantify how their privacy
preferences affect the consistency in estimating the optimal ranking function.
Extensive numerical experiments are carried out to verify the theoretical

management systems into two main categories (relational and non-relational) and
several sub categories. Ranking of various sub categories for the month of
July, 2021 are presented in the form of popularity score calculated and managed
by DB-Engines. Popularity trend for each category is also presented to look at
the change in popularity since 2013. Complete ranking and trend of top 20

Oracle and MySQL being two most popular systems. However, recent trends have
shown DBMSs like Time Series and Document Store getting more and more popular
with their wide use in IOT technology and BigData, respectively.

phase transitions, thermodynamic limits, scaling laws, and many other phenomena

the Ising model that features competing agents influencing the behavior of the
spins. With long-range interactions, we consider a mean-field limit resulting
in a nonlocal potential game at the mesoscopic scale. This game exhibits a
phase transition and multiple constant Nash-equilibria in the supercritical

  Our analysis focuses on a sharp interface limit for which potential
minimizing solutions to the Ising game concentrate on two of the constant
Nash-equilibria. We show that the mesoscopic problem can be recast as a mixed
local/nonlocal space-time Allen-Cahn type minimization problem. We prove, using
a $\Gamma$-convergence argument, that the limiting interface minimizes a
space-time anisotropic perimeter type energy functional. This macroscopic scale
problem could also be viewed as a problem of optimal control of interface
motion. Sharp interface limits of Allen-Cahn type functionals have been well
studied. We build on that literature with new techniques to handle a mixture of

observations below 30 solar radii clearly show a positive correlation between
proton temperature and wind speed and a negative correlation between electron
temperature and wind speed. One year (2019) of WIND data confirm that proton
temperature is positively correlated with solar wind speed, but the electron
temperature increases with the solar wind speed for slow wind while it
decreases with the solar wind speed for fast wind. Using a one-dimensional
Alfv\'en-wave-driven solar wind model with different proton and electron
temperatures, we for the first time find that if most of the dissipated
Alfv\'en wave energy heats the ions instead of electrons, a positive
$T_i-V_{SW}$ correlation and a negative $T_e-V_{SW}$ correlation arise
naturally. If the electrons gain a small but finite portion of the dissipated

complicated by contamination of the F360M by PAH emission and variations in the
stellar spectral energy distribution slopes between 3.0 and 3.6 micron. We
modify the empirical prescription from Lai et al. (2020) to remove the
starlight continuum in our highly resolved galaxies, which have a range of
starlight- and PAH-dominated lines-of-sight. Analyzing radially binned profiles
of the F335M$_{\rm PAH}$ emission, we find that between 5-65% of the F335M

kernel is addressed by finding a policy that optimizes the worst-case

unexplored. In this paper, we focus on robust average-reward MDPs, where the
goal is to find a policy that optimizes the worst-case average reward over an

MDPs using discounted MDPs. We prove that the robust discounted value function
converges to the robust average-reward as the discount factor $\gamma$ goes to
$1$, and moreover, when $\gamma$ is large, any optimal policy of the robust
discounted MDP is also an optimal policy of the robust average-reward. We
further design a robust dynamic programming approach, and theoretically
characterize its convergence to the optimum. Then, we investigate robust
average-reward MDPs directly without using discounted MDPs as an intermediate
step. We derive the robust Bellman equation for robust average-reward MDPs,
prove that the optimal policy can be derived from its solution, and further
design a robust relative value iteration algorithm that provably finds its
solution, or equivalently, the optimal robust policy.

from edge devices to data centers. Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs)
represent an architectural midpoint between the flexibility of an FPGA and the
efficiency of an ASIC and are a promising candidate for servicing multi-tasked
workloads within an application domain. Unfortunately, scheduling multiple
tasks onto a CGRA is challenging. CGRAs lack abstractions that capture hardware
resources, leaving workload schedulers unable to reason about performance,
energy, and utilization for different schedules. This work first proposes a
CGRA architecture that can flexibly partition key resources, including the
global buffer memory capacity, the global buffer memory bandwidth, and the
compute resources. Partitioned resources serve as hardware abstractions that
decouple compilation and resource allocation. The compiler uses these
abstractions for coarse-grained resource mapping, and the scheduler uses them
for flexible resource allocation at run time. We then propose two hardware
mechanisms to support multi-task execution. A flexible-shape execution region
increases the overall resource utilization by mapping multiple tasks with
different resource requirements. Dynamic partial reconfiguration (DPR) enables
a CGRA to update the hardware configuration as the scheduler makes decisions
rapidly. We show that our abstraction can help automatic and efficient
scheduling of multi-tasked workloads onto our target CGRA with high
utilization, resulting in 1.05x-1.24x higher throughput and a 23-28% lower
latency in a multi-tasked cloud workload and 60.8% reduced latency in an
autonomous system workload when compared to a baseline CGRA running single

the curvature and moment. To model the damage, a rule based on Griffith theory
for the critical normal strain of the bond is proposed in analogy to the phase
field model, which can be applied individually to each bond and provides strain
localization. With this rule, the crack direction can be automatically
predicted by simply cutting the bond, giving comparable results to the phase
field method. At the same time, a damage rule for critical shear strains in
shear fractures is proposed. Furthermore, an incremental form of the plasticity

traditional document summarization, timeline summarization needs to model the
time series information of the input events and summarize important events in
chronological order. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a
Unified Timeline Summarizer (UTS) that can generate abstractive and extractive
timeline summaries in time order. Concretely, in the encoder part, we propose a
graph-based event encoder that relates multiple events according to their
content dependency and learns a global representation of each event. In the
decoder part, to ensure the chronological order of the abstractive summary, we
propose to extract the feature of event-level attention in its generation
process with sequential information remained and use it to simulate the
evolutionary attention of the ground truth summary. The event-level attention
can also be used to assist in extracting summary, where the extracted summary
also comes in time sequence. We augment the previous Chinese large-scale
timeline summarization dataset and collect a new English timeline dataset.
Extensive experiments conducted on these datasets and on the out-of-domain
Timeline 17 dataset show that UTS achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of both automatic and human evaluations.

finite width of a shock, thus need to be pre-accelerated before they can cross
it and be accelerated by diffusive shock acceleration. One region where
pre-acceleration may occur is the inner foreshock, which upstream electrons
must pass through before any potential downstream crossing. In this paper, we
perform a large scale particle-in-cell simulation that generates a single shock
with parameters motivated from supernova remnants. Within the foreshock,
reflected electrons excite the oblique whistler instability and produce
electromagnetic whistler waves, which co-move with the upstream flow and as
non-linear structures eventually reach radii of up to 5 ion-gyroradii. We show
that the inner electromagnetic configuration of the whistlers evolves into
complex non-linear structures bound by a strong magnetic field around 4 times
the upstream value. Although these non-linear structures do not in general
interact with co-spatial upstream electrons, they resonate with electrons that
have been reflected at the shock. We show that they can scatter, or even trap,
reflected electrons, confining around $0.8\%$ of the total upstream electron
population to the region close to the shock where they can undergo substantial
pre-acceleration. This acceleration process is similar to, yet approximately 3
times more efficient than, stochastic shock drift acceleration.

framework can be exploited to predict the waveguide dispersion relation. We
demonstrate the capabilities of our formulation by revisiting the dynamics of
two representative space-time modulated systems, e.g. the non-reciprocal
propagation of (i) flexural waves along a metabeam and (ii) surface acoustic
waves along a metasurface. Given its flexibility, the proposed method can pave
the way towards the design of novel devices able to realize unidirectional

filters that allow an RL-based ACC controller to explore freely within a
collision safe set. Specifically, we derive control barrier functions for high
relative degree nonlinear systems to take into account inertia effects relevant
to commercial vehicles. We also outline an algorithm for accommodating
actuation saturation with these barrier functions. While any RL algorithm can
be used as the performance ACC controller together with these filters, we
implement the Maximum A Posteriori Policy Optimization (MPO) algorithm with a
hybrid action space that learns fuel optimal gear selection and torque control
policies. The safety filtering RL approach is contrasted with a reward shaping
RL approach that only learns to avoid collisions after sufficient training.
Evaluations on different drive cycles demonstrate significant improvements in
fuel economy with the proposed approach compared to baseline ACC algorithms.

satisfying the so-called manifold hypothesis, assuming data points in the
high-dimensional ambient space to lie in close vicinity of a submanifold of
much lower dimension. In machine learning, encoder-decoder pair based
generative modelling approaches have been successful in learning complicated
high-dimensional distributions such as those over images and texts by
explicitly imposing the low-dimensional manifold structure. In this work, we
introduce a new approach for estimating distributions on unknown submanifolds
via mixtures of generative models. We show that conventional generative
modeling approaches using a single encoder-decoder pair are generally unable to
capture data distributions under the manifold hypothesis, unless the underlying
manifold admits a global parametrization; however, this issue can be solved by
using a collection of encoder-decoder pairs for learning different local
patches of the data supporting manifold. A rigorous theoretical analysis is
developed to demonstrate that the proposed estimator attains the
minimax-optimal rate of convergence for the implicit estimation of data
distributions with manifold structures. Our experiments show that, by utilizing
parameter sharing, the proposed method can significantly improve the
performance of conventional auto-encoder based generative modelling approaches
with minimal additional computational efforts.

Meteorological Institute (MET Norway) produces 120-hour regional operational
storm surge forecasts along the coast of Norway based on the Regional Ocean
Modeling System (ROMS), using a model setup called Nordic4-SS. Despite advances
in the development of models and computational capabilities, forecast errors
remain large enough to impact response measures and issued alerts, in
particular, during the strongest storm events. Reducing these errors will
positively impact the efficiency of the warning systems while minimizing
efforts and resources spent on mitigation. Here, we investigate how forecasts
can be improved with residual learning, i.e., training data-driven models to
predict the residuals in forecasts from Nordic4-SS. A simple error mapping
technique and a more sophisticated Neural Network (NN) method are tested. Using
the NN residual correction method, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in the
Oslo Fjord is reduced by 36% for lead times of one hour and 9% for 24 hours.
Therefore, the residual NN method is a promising direction for correcting storm
surge forecasts, especially on short timescales. Moreover, it is well adapted
to being deployed operationally, as i) the correction is applied on top of the
existing model and requires no changes to it, ii) all predictors used for NN
inference are already available operationally, iii) prediction by the NNs is
very fast, typically a few seconds per station, and iv) the NN correction can
be provided to a human expert who may inspect it, compare it with the model
output, and see how much correction is brought by the NN, allowing to
capitalize on human expertise as a quality validation of the NN output.

machines such requirements pose no fundamental problems as long as the physical

digital microchips become scaled down into the few-nanometer range where
quantum noise and device mismatch become unavoidable, or when the digital

other unconventional hardware bases, it can become difficult to relate
timescale conditions to the physical hardware dynamics. Here we explore the

concerns owing to their wide applications on safety-critical tasks. Compared
with images, videos have much high dimension, which brings huge computational
costs when generating adversarial videos. This is especially serious for the
query-based black-box attacks where gradient estimation for the threat models
is usually utilized, and high dimensions will lead to a large number of
queries. To mitigate this issue, we propose to simultaneously eliminate the
temporal and spatial redundancy within the video to achieve an effective and
efficient gradient estimation on the reduced searching space, and thus query
number could decrease. To implement this idea, we design the novel Adversarial
spatial-temporal Focus (AstFocus) attack on videos, which performs attacks on
the simultaneously focused key frames and key regions from the inter-frames and
intra-frames in the video. AstFocus attack is based on the cooperative
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework. One agent is responsible
for selecting key frames, and another agent is responsible for selecting key
regions. These two agents are jointly trained by the common rewards received
from the black-box threat models to perform a cooperative prediction. By
continuously querying, the reduced searching space composed of key frames and
key regions is becoming precise, and the whole query number becomes less than
that on the original video. Extensive experiments on four mainstream video
recognition models and three widely used action recognition datasets
demonstrate that the proposed AstFocus attack outperforms the SOTA methods,
which is prevenient in fooling rate, query number, time, and perturbation
magnitude at the same.

scheduling in many cropping systems by applying adaptive amounts of water based
on various measurements over time. The goal is to discover an intelligent
decision rule that processes information available to growers and prescribes
sensible irrigation amounts for the time steps considered. Due to the technical
novelty, however, the research on the technique remains sparse and impractical.
To accelerate the progress, the paper proposes a principled framework and
actionable procedure that allow researchers to formulate their own optimisation
problems and implement solution algorithms based on deep reinforcement
learning. The effectiveness of the framework was demonstrated using a case
study of irrigated wheat grown in a productive region of Australia where
profits were maximised. Specifically, the decision rule takes nine state
variable inputs: crop phenological stage, leaf area index, extractable soil
water for each of the five top layers, cumulative rainfall and cumulative
irrigation. It returns a probabilistic prescription over five candidate
irrigation amounts (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 mm) every day. The production system
was simulated at Goondiwindi using the APSIM-Wheat crop model. After training
in the learning environment using 1981-2010 weather data, the learned decision
rule was tested individually for each year of 2011-2020. The results were
compared against the benchmark profits obtained by a conventional rule common
in the region. The discovered decision rule prescribed daily irrigation amounts
that uniformly improved on the conventional rule for all the testing years, and
the largest improvement reached 17% in 2018. The framework is general and
applicable to a wide range of cropping systems with realistic optimisation
problems.

allowing for efficient online approximation of expectations of additive

self-normalised importance sampling, the PaRIS estimator is biased. Our first
contribution is to design a novel additive smoothing algorithm, the Parisian

world (like what will happen next), and their tasks (like a preferred goal).
However, human internal models are not always perfect: for example, it is easy
to underestimate a robot's inertia. Nevertheless, these models change and
improve over time as humans gather more experience. Interestingly, robot
actions influence what this experience is, and therefore influence how people's
internal models change. In this work we take a step towards enabling robots to
understand the influence they have, leverage it to better assist people, and
help human models more quickly align with reality. Our key idea is to model the
human's learning as a nonlinear dynamical system which evolves the human's
internal model given new observations. We formulate a novel optimization
problem to infer the human's learning dynamics from demonstrations that
naturally exhibit human learning. We then formalize how robots can influence
human learning by embedding the human's learning dynamics model into the robot
planning problem. Although our formulations provide concrete problem
statements, they are intractable to solve in full generality. We contribute an
approximation that sacrifices the complexity of the human internal models we
can represent, but enables robots to learn the nonlinear dynamics of these
internal models. We evaluate our inference and planning methods in a suite of
simulated environments and an in-person user study, where a 7DOF robotic arm
teaches participants to be better teleoperators. While influencing human
learning remains an open problem, our results demonstrate that this influence
is possible and can be helpful in real human-robot interaction.

like the solar wind and the heating of the coronal plasma, are ubiquitous

reconnection of opposite polarity magnetic fields producing a short-lived jet
of hot plasma and Alfv\'en waves into the corona. The discrete nature of these
jetlet events leads to intermittent outflows from the corona, which homogenize
as they propagate away from the Sun and form the solar wind. This discovery
establishes the importance of small-scale magnetic reconnection in solar and

heating and solar wind acceleration. Based on previous analyses linking the
switchbacks to the magnetic network, we also argue that these new observations

macroscale elastic shear deformations of the amorphous solid does not depend on

deformations -- the effective modulus exhibits a scale-dependence, softening as

interacted items. However, since the inherent causal reasons that lead to the
observed users' behaviors are not considered, multiple types of biases could
exist in the generated recommendations. In addition, the causal motives that
drive user activities are usually entangled in these RSs, where the

of interest in enhancing traditional RSs with causal inference techniques. In
this survey, we provide a systematic overview of causal RSs and help readers

uncertainty in path choices given recommendations is also considered. We model
the behavior uncertainty based on the passenger's prior preferences and
posterior path choice probability distribution with two new concepts:
epsilon-feasibility and Gamma-concentration, which control the mean and
variance of path flows in the optimization problem. We show that these two
concepts can be seen as a way of approximating the recourse function (expected

these two concepts help to bound the difference between the approximated

closed-form formulations of the mean and variance of the queue length and

behavior in the system. The random service suspension is modeled as a two-state
(disruption and normal) Markov process. We prove that headway is distributed as
the difference between two compound Poisson exponential random variables. The
distribution is used to specify the mean and variance of queue length and
waiting time at each station with analytical formulations. The closed-form
stability condition of the system is also derived, implying that the system is
more likely to be unstable with high incident rates and long incident duration.
The proposed model is implemented on a bus network. Results show that higher
incident rates and higher average incident duration will increase both the mean
and variance of queue length and waiting time, which are consistent with the
theoretical analysis. Crowding stations are more vulnerable to random service
suspensions. The theoretical results are validated with a simulation model,
showing consistency between the two outcomes.

Accordingly, data privacy preservation is vital for sustaining the
proliferation of IoT services. In particular, privacy-preserving IoT connects
devices embedded with sensors and maintains the data privacy of people.
However, common misconceptions exist among IoT researchers, service providers,
and users about privacy-preserving IoT.
  This article refutes five common misconceptions about privacy-preserving IoT
concerning data sensing and innovation, regulations, and privacy safeguards.
For example, IoT users have a common misconception that no data collection is
permitted in data privacy regulations. On the other hand, IoT service providers
often think data privacy impedes IoT sensing and innovation. Addressing these
misconceptions is essential for making progress in privacy-preserving IoT. This
article refutes such common misconceptions using real-world experiments and
online survey research. First, the experiments indicate that data privacy
should not be perceived as an impediment in IoT but as an opportunity to
increase customer retention and trust. Second, privacy-preserving IoT is not
exclusively a regulatory problem but also a functional necessity that must be
incorporated in the early stages of any IoT design. Third, people do not trust
services that lack sufficient privacy measures. Fourth, conventional data
security principles do not guarantee data privacy protection, and data privacy
can be exposed even if data is securely stored. Fifth, IoT decentralization
does not attain absolute privacy preservation.

distributions. To assess the estimator properties, we conducted a simulation
study considering four different sample sizes and three different correlation
values for each distribution. We achieved unbiased and consistent estimators
for Poisson and NB distributions; for COM-Poisson estimators were consistent,
but biased, especially for dispersion, variance, and correlation parameter
estimators. These models were applied to two datasets. The first concerns a
sample from 30 different sites collected in Australia where the number of times
each one of the 41 different ant species was registered; which results in an
impressive 820 variance-covariance and 41 dispersion parameters estimated
simultaneously, let alone the regression parameters. The second is from the
Australia Health Survey with 5 response variables and 5190 respondents. These
datasets can be considered overdispersed by the generalized dispersion index.
The COM-Poisson model overcame the other two competitors considering three
goodness-of-fit indexes. Therefore, the proposed model is capable of dealing
with multivariate count data, and measuring any kind of correlation between
them taking into account the effects of the covariates.

be made at high frequencies, yet information that varies at a slower timescale
also influences the optimal policy. Examples include: (1) service allocation
for a multi-class queue with (slowly varying) stochastic costs, (2) a restless
multi-armed bandit with an environmental state, and (3) energy demand response,
where both day-ahead and real-time prices play a role in the firm's revenue.
Models that fully capture these problems often result in MDPs with large state
spaces and large effective time horizons (due to frequent decisions), rendering
them computationally intractable. We propose an approximate dynamic programming
algorithmic framework based on the idea of ""freezing"" the slow states, solving
a set of simpler finite-horizon MDPs (the lower-level MDPs), and applying value

widely adopting cloud services to mitigate the burdens of maintenance. Despite
its scalability and ease of use, many users who own sensitive data refrain from
fully utilizing cloud services due to confidentiality concerns. Maintaining
data confidentiality for data at rest and in transit has been widely explored
but data remains vulnerable in the cloud while it is in use. This vulnerability
is further elevated once the scope of computing spans across the edge-to-cloud
continuum. Accordingly, the goal of this dissertation is to enable data
confidentiality by adopting confidential computing across the continuum.
Towards this goal, one approach we explore is to separate the intelligence
aspect of data processing from the pattern-matching aspect. We present our
approach to make confidential data clustering on the cloud, and then develop
confidential search service across edge-to-cloud for unstructured text data.
Our proposed clustering solution named ClusPr, performs topic-based clustering
for static and dynamic datasets that improves cluster coherency up to
30%-to-60% when compared with other encryption-based clustering techniques. Our
trusted enterprise search service named SAED, provides context-aware and
personalized semantic search over confidential data across the continuum. We
realized that enabling confidential computing across edge-to-cloud requires
major contribution from the edge tiers particularly to run multiple Deep
Learning (DL) services concurrently. This raises memory contention on the edge
tier. To resolve this, we develop Edge-MultiAI framework to manage Neural
Network (NN) models of DL applications such that it can meet the latency
constraints of the DL applications without compromising inference accuracy.

individual data instances influence the optimization and generalization of a

deep learning. However, most of the existing works on data valuation require
actual training of a model, which often demands high-computational cost. In
this paper, we provide a training-free data valuation score, called
complexity-gap score, which is a data-centric score to quantify the influence
of individual instances in generalization of two-layer overparameterized neural
networks. The proposed score can quantify irregularity of the instances and
measure how much each data instance contributes in the total movement of the
network parameters during training. We theoretically analyze and empirically
demonstrate the effectiveness of the complexity-gap score in finding `irregular

analyzing datasets and diagnosing training dynamics. Our code is publicly

  1) Is knowing the market structure a priori necessary for effective

  2) Which market mechanism results in the highest overall social welfare? To
this end a multi-period, stochastic GATE planning formulation is developed for
both nodal and zonal market designs. The approach considers the costs and

on potential social welfare in zonal market designs is calculated and it is
concluded that from a generation and transmission perspective, planning under

further show that their performance can be significantly boosted by filtering
candidate source tasks based on modality and RoI characteristics. Our
experiments on brain matter, brain tumor, and white matter hyperintensities
segmentation datasets reveal that transferring from different tasks under the
same modality is often more successful than transferring from the same task
under different modalities. Furthermore, within the same modality, transferring
from the source task that has stronger RoI shape similarity with the target

5-$\sigma$ column density limit of $10^{17.9}$ cm$^{-2}$ assuming a line width
of 20 km s$^{-1}$. Taking the existing interferometric HI image from the
HALOGAS project of WSRT as reference, we are able to identify and characterize
a significant excess of large-scale, low-density, and diffuse HI in the group.
This diffuse HI extends for more than 120 kpc across, and accounts for more
than one fourth of the total HI detected by FAST in and around the galaxy NGC
4631. In the region of the tidal tails, the diffuse HI has a typical column
density above $10^{19.5}$ cm$^{-2}$, and is highly turbulent with a velocity
dispersion around 50 km s$^{-1}$. It increases in column density with the dense
HI, and tends to be associated with the kinematically ``hotter'' part of the
dense HI. Through simple modeling, we find that the majority of the diffuse HI
in the tail region is likely to induce cooling out of the hot IGM instead of
evaporating or being radiatively ionized. Given these relations of gas in
different phases, the diffuse HI may represent a condensing phase of the IGM.
Active tidal interactions on-going and in the past may have produced the
wide-spreading HI distribution, and triggered the gas accretion to NGC 4631
through the phase of the diffuse HI.

a wide range of stiffness modulation (~20Nm/rad to ~1KNm/rad), iii)
low-energy-cost stiffness modulation at equilibrium and non-equilibrium

compressing gradients in stochastic optimization in order to alleviate the
communication bottleneck. These works have collectively revealed that
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is robust to structured perturbations such as
quantization, sparsification, and delays. Perhaps surprisingly, despite the
surge of interest in large-scale, multi-agent reinforcement learning, almost
nothing is known about the analogous question: Are common reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithms also robust to similar perturbations? In this paper,
we investigate this question by studying a variant of the classical temporal
difference (TD) learning algorithm with a perturbed update direction, where a
general compression operator is used to model the perturbation. Our main
technical contribution is to show that compressed TD algorithms, coupled with
an error-feedback mechanism used widely in optimization, exhibit the same
non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees as their SGD counterparts. We then extend
our results significantly to nonlinear stochastic approximation algorithms and
multi-agent settings. In particular, we prove that for multi-agent TD learning,
one can achieve linear convergence speedups in the number of agents while
communicating just $\tilde{O}(1)$ bits per agent at each time step. Our work is
the first to provide finite-time results in RL that account for general
compression operators and error-feedback in tandem with linear function
approximation and Markovian sampling. Our analysis hinges on studying the drift
of a novel Lyapunov function that captures the dynamics of a memory variable

learning-based classification model. To solve this problem, this paper proposes
an improved auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network~(AC-GAN)
architecture, namely auxiliary classifier variational autoencoder generative
adversarial network (AC-VAEGAN). AC-VAEGAN can synthesize higher quality
sea-land clutter samples than AC-GAN and serve as an effective tool for data
augmentation. Specifically, a 1-dimensional convolutional AC-VAEGAN
architecture is designed to synthesize sea-land clutter samples. Additionally,
an evaluation method combining both traditional evaluation of GAN domain and
statistical evaluation of signal domain is proposed to evaluate the quality of
synthetic samples. Using a dataset of OTHR sea-land clutter, both the quality
of the synthetic samples and the performance of data augmentation of AC-VAEGAN
are verified. Further, the effect of AC-VAEGAN as a data augmentation method on
the classification performance of imbalanced and scarce sea-land clutter
samples is validated. The experiment results show that the quality of samples
synthesized by AC-VAEGAN is better than that of AC-GAN, and the data
augmentation method with AC-VAEGAN is able to improve the classification
performance in the case of imbalanced and scarce sea-land clutter samples.

performed in a closed-loop by using feedback in the form of change in affective
state. For feedback to the Armoni, an EEG (Electroencephalograph) headband is
used. All the changes in EEG are observed and classified against the change in
the mean and standard deviation value of all frequency bands of signal. This

What are emerging engineering paradigm shifts in the 4IR? What is the
relationship between the data-intensive paradigm and digital engineering

pattern of industrial revolutions, this article argues that ubiquitous machine
intelligence (uMI) is the defining power brought by the 4IR. Digitalization is
a condition to leverage ubiquitous machine intelligence. Digital engineering
transformation towards Industry 4.0 has three essential building blocks:
digitalization of engineering, leveraging ubiquitous machine intelligence, and
building digital trust and security. The engineering design community at large

communication. The quintessential dark energy black holes shadow characterizes
by its mass $(M)$, spin parameter $(a)$, quintessential dark energy parameter
$(\omega_q)$, and normalization factor $(\gamma)$. The dark energy parameter
$\omega_q$ can take values in between $-1.1<\omega_q<-1/3$ and follows the
equation of state $\omega_q$=pressure$(p)$/energy density($\rho_q)$. This state
parameter significantly affects the shape and size of the black hole shadow. We
generalize all the geodesic equations of motion for $\omega_q$ and obtain
relation to visualize the black hole shadow by a static observer at any
arbitrary distance in the domain of outer communication. We analytically
estimate the black hole shadow observables: radius $R_s$, distortion parameter
$\delta_s$ and the shadow area $A$. Using the numerical values of shadow radius
$R_s$ and area $A$, we obtain the angular diameter of the black hole shadow.
The angular size of the M87 and Sgr A$^*$ black holes are $\ 42 \pm 3 \mu a s$

transverse CPGE of Lorentz invariant Weyl fermions is forced to be zero. We
find that the transverse photocurrents of Weyl fermions are associated not only
with the Chern numbers but also with the degree of Lorentz-symmetry breaking in

vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. In recent years, with the
successful application of neural machine translation (NMT) models in natural
language processing (NLP), researchers have tried to build neural decompilers
by borrowing the idea of NMT. They formulate the decompilation process as a
translation problem between LPL and HPL, aiming to reduce the human cost
required to develop decompilation tools and improve their generalizability.
However, state-of-the-art learning-based decompilers do not cope well with
compiler-optimized binaries. Since real-world binaries are mostly
compiler-optimized, decompilers that do not consider optimized binaries have
limited practical significance. In this paper, we propose a novel
learning-based approach named NeurDP, that targets compiler-optimized binaries.
NeurDP uses a graph neural network (GNN) model to convert LPL to an
intermediate representation (IR), which bridges the gap between source code and
optimized binary. We also design an Optimized Translation Unit (OTU) to split
functions into smaller code fragments for better translation performance.
Evaluation results on datasets containing various types of statements show that
NeurDP can decompile optimized binaries with 45.21% higher accuracy than
state-of-the-art neural decompilation frameworks.

cross-device discrepancy. Then, we systematically investigate 11 LiDAR semantic
segmentation models, especially spanning different input representations (e.g.,
point clouds, voxels, projected images, and etc.), network architectures and
training schemes. Through this study, we obtain two insights: 1) We find out
that the input representation plays a crucial role in robustness. Specifically,
under specific corruptions, different representations perform variously. 2)
Although state-of-the-art methods on LiDAR semantic segmentation achieve
promising results on clean data, they are less robust when dealing with noisy

To fully prepare for the interview with the recruiters, job seekers usually

interview with peers is generally far away from the real interview experience:
the mock interviewers are not guaranteed to be professional and are not likely
to behave like a real interviewer. Due to the rapid growth of online
recruitment in recent years, recruiters tend to have online interviews, which
makes it possible to collect real interview data from real interviewers. In
this paper, we propose a novel application named EZInterviewer, which aims to
learn from the online interview data and provides mock interview services to
the job seekers. The task is challenging in two ways: (1) the interview data
are now available but still of low-resource; (2) to generate meaningful and
relevant interview dialogs requires thorough understanding of both resumes and
job descriptions. To address the low-resource challenge, EZInterviewer is
trained on a very small set of interview dialogs. The key idea is to reduce the
number of parameters that rely on interview dialogs by disentangling the
knowledge selector and dialog generator so that most parameters can be trained
with ungrounded dialogs as well as the resume data that are not low-resource.
Evaluation results on a real-world job interview dialog dataset indicate that
we achieve promising results to generate mock interviews. With the help of

by the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of diffeomorphism invariance which

a target label the attacker is interested in exploiting. A backdoored DNN
performs well on clean test images, yet persistently predicts an
attacker-defined label for any sample in the presence of the backdoor trigger.
Although backdoor attacks have been extensively studied in the image domain,
there are very few works that explore such attacks in the video domain, and
they tend to conclude that image backdoor attacks are less effective in the
video domain. In this work, we revisit the traditional backdoor threat model
and incorporate additional video-related aspects to that model. We show that
poisoned-label image backdoor attacks could be extended temporally in two ways,
statically and dynamically, leading to highly effective attacks in the video
domain. In addition, we explore natural video backdoors to highlight the
seriousness of this vulnerability in the video domain. And, for the first time,
we study multi-modal (audiovisual) backdoor attacks against video action
recognition models, where we show that attacking a single modality is enough
for achieving a high attack success rate.

both linear and nonlinear growth in a wide class gyrokinetic systems. The
simplicity afforded by this approach is accompanied by some drawbacks, notably
the lack of any explicit treatment of wave-particle effects, which makes the
theory unable to describe things like stability thresholds or dependence on the
geometry of the background magnetic field. As a step toward overcoming these
limitations, we propose an extension of the theory based on a generalization of
free energy. With this it is demonstrated that resonance effects are recovered,
and the bounds on growth are significantly reduced. The simplicity and
efficient computation of the associated ``optimal'' growth rates makes the
theory potentially applicable to stellarator optimization.

tasks. However, most of existing studies require to pretrain the Transformer
backbone on a large-scale labeled dataset (e.g., ImageNet) for achieving
satisfactory performance, which is usually unavailable for medical images.
Additionally, due to the gap between medical and natural images, the
improvement generated by the ImageNet pretrained weights significantly degrades
while transferring the weights to medical image processing tasks. In this
paper, we propose Bootstrap Own Latent of Transformer (BOLT), a self-supervised
learning approach specifically for medical image classification with the
Transformer backbone. Our BOLT consists of two networks, namely online and
target branches, for self-supervised representation learning. Concretely, the
online network is trained to predict the target network representation of the
same patch embedding tokens with a different perturbation. To maximally
excavate the impact of Transformer from limited medical data, we propose an
auxiliary difficulty ranking task. The Transformer is enforced to identify
which branch (i.e., online/target) is processing the more difficult perturbed
tokens. Overall, the Transformer endeavours itself to distill the
transformation-invariant features from the perturbed tokens to simultaneously
achieve difficulty measurement and maintain the consistency of self-supervised
representations. The proposed BOLT is evaluated on three medical image
processing tasks, i.e., skin lesion classification, knee fatigue fracture
grading and diabetic retinopathy grading. The experimental results validate the
superiority of our BOLT for medical image classification, compared to ImageNet
pretrained weights and state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches.

develop a new method that infers the minimum tree-child network by aligning

methodology for atomic composition of nonblocking operations on concurrent data
structures. Unlike previous software transactional memory (STM) approaches,
NBTC leverages the linearizability of existing nonblocking structures, reducing
the number of memory accesses that must be executed together, atomically, to
only one per operation in most cases (these are typically the linearizing
instructions of the constituent operations).
  Our obstruction-free implementation of NBTC, which we call Medley, makes it
easy to transform most nonblocking data structures into transactional
counterparts while preserving their liveness and high concurrency. In our
experiments, Medley outperforms Lock-Free Transactional Transform (LFTT), the
fastest prior competing methodology, by 40--170%. The marginal overhead of
Medley's transactional composition, relative to separate operations performed
in succession, is roughly 2.2$\times$.
  For persistent data structures, we observe that failure atomicity for
transactions can be achieved ""almost for free"" with epoch-based periodic
persistence. Toward that end, we integrate Medley with nbMontage, a general
system for periodically persistent data structures. The resulting txMontage
provides ACID transactions and achieves throughput up to two orders of
magnitude higher than that of the OneFile persistent STM system.

  Modeling","ICLR2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Witnessing the impressive achievements of pre-training techniques on
large-scale data in the field of computer vision and natural language
processing, we wonder whether this idea could be adapted in a grab-and-go
spirit, and mitigate the sample inefficiency problem for visuomotor driving.
Given the highly dynamic and variant nature of the input, the visuomotor
driving task inherently lacks view and translation invariance, and the visual
input contains massive irrelevant information for decision making, resulting in
predominant pre-training approaches from general vision less suitable for the
autonomous driving task. To this end, we propose PPGeo (Policy Pre-training via
Geometric modeling), an intuitive and straightforward fully self-supervised
framework curated for the policy pretraining in visuomotor driving. We aim at
learning policy representations as a powerful abstraction by modeling 3D
geometric scenes on large-scale unlabeled and uncalibrated YouTube driving
videos. The proposed PPGeo is performed in two stages to support effective
self-supervised training. In the first stage, the geometric modeling framework
generates pose and depth predictions simultaneously, with two consecutive
frames as input. In the second stage, the visual encoder learns driving policy
representation by predicting the future ego-motion and optimizing with the
photometric error based on current visual observation only. As such, the
pre-trained visual encoder is equipped with rich driving policy related
representations and thereby competent for multiple visuomotor driving tasks.
Extensive experiments covering a wide span of challenging scenarios have
demonstrated the superiority of our proposed approach, where improvements range
from 2% to even over 100% with very limited data.

products, where firms are boundedly rational and consumers are assumed to
possess an underlying CES utility function. We mainly focus on two distinct
degrees of product substitutability. Several tools based on symbolic
computations such as the triangular decomposition method and the PCAD method
are employed in the analytical investigation of the model. The uniqueness of
the non-vanishing equilibrium is proved and rigorous conditions for the local
stability of this equilibrium are established for the first time. Most
importantly, we find that increasing the substitutability degree or decreasing
the product differentiation has an effect of destabilization for our Bertrand
model, which is in contrast with the relative conclusions for the Cournot
models. This finding could be conducive to the revelation of the essential
difference between dynamic Cournot and Bertrand oligopolies with differentiated
goods. In the special case of identical marginal costs, we derive that lower
degrees of product differentiation mean lower prices, higher supplies, lower
profits, and lower social welfare. Furthermore, complex dynamics such as
periodic orbits and chaos are reported through our numerical simulations.

Specifically, by assuming that the offloading decision is given, the problem is
decoupled into two sub-problems, i.e., the resource allocation problem for the
devices set that completes the inference tasks locally, and that for the
devices set that offloads tasks. For the problem of offloading decision
optimization, we propose a Channel-Aware heuristic algorithm. To further reduce
the complexity, we propose an alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) based distributed algorithm. The ADMM-based algorithm has a low
computational complexity that grows linearly with the number of devices.
Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of proposed algorithms. The

best fit values is at a level more than $3\sigma$ with a best fit $d_{crit}$

tension is that the new likelihood model, successfully models two signals
hidden in the data: 1. The well known systematic effect called 'volumetric
redshift scatter bias' which is due to asymmetric peculiar velocity variations
at redshifts $z<0.01$ induced by unequal projected volumes at lower and higher
distances compared to a given distance and 2. A mild signal for a change of
intrinsic SnIa luminosity at about $20Mpc$. This interpretation of the results
is confirmed by truncating the $z<0.01$ Hubble diagram data from Pantheon+
where the above systematic is dominant and showing that the $M_<-M_>$ tension
decreases from above $3\sigma$ to a little less than $2\sigma$. It is also
confirmed by a Monte Carlo simulation comparing the SnIa absolute luminosities
$M_i$ of SnIa+Cepheid hosts, with the anticipated luminosities in the context
of a homogeneous single absolute magnitude $M$. This simulation shows that the
maximum significance of the SnIa luminosity transition ($\Sigma\equiv
\frac{|M_>-M_<|}{\sqrt{\sigma_{M_>}^2+\sigma_{M_<}^2}}$) in the real data, is
larger than the corresponding maximum significance of $94\%$ of the

decade-long light curve. The synchrotron and inverse-Compton emissions have the
same power spectral density, suggesting that the long-term jet variability is
irrelevant to the emission mechanism. In the plot of the rest-frame timescale
versus black hole mass, the optical-$\gamma$-ray timescales of the jet
variability occupy almost the same space with the timescales of accretion disk
emission from normal quasars, which may imply that the long-term variabilities
of the jet and accretion disk are driven by the same physical process. It is
suggested that the nonthermal optical-X-ray and $\gamma$-ray emissions are
produced in the same region, while the radio core which can be resolved by
very-long-baseline interferometry locates at a far more distant region from the
black hole. Our study suggests a new methodology for comparing thermal and
nonthermal emissions, which is achieved by using the standard GP method.

advances have been made to overcome the challenges in causal effect estimation
with observational data, such as missing counterfactual outcomes and selection
bias between treatment and control groups, the existing methods mainly focus on
source-specific and stationary observational data. Such learning strategies
assume that all observational data are already available during the training
phase and from only one source. This practical concern of accessibility is
ubiquitous in various academic and industrial applications. That's what it
boiled down to: in the era of big data, we face new challenges in causal
inference with observational data, i.e., the extensibility for incrementally
available observational data, the adaptability for extra domain adaptation
problem except for the imbalance between treatment and control groups, and the
accessibility for an enormous amount of data. In this position paper, we
formally define the problem of continual treatment effect estimation, describe
its research challenges, and then present possible solutions to this problem.
Moreover, we will discuss future research directions on this topic.

acquired concepts, a drawback affecting deep learning models and that goes by
the name of catastrophic forgetting, is a hard challenge. Currently, deep
learning methods can attain impressive results when the data modeled does not
undergo a considerable distributional shift in subsequent learning sessions,
but whenever we expose such systems to this incremental setting, performance
drop very quickly. Overcoming this limitation is fundamental as it would allow
us to build truly intelligent systems showing stability and plasticity.
Secondly, it would allow us to overcome the onerous limitation of retraining
these architectures from scratch with the new updated data. In this thesis, we
tackle the problem from multiple directions. In a first study, we show that in
rehearsal-based techniques (systems that use memory buffer), the quantity of
data stored in the rehearsal buffer is a more important factor over the quality
of the data. Secondly, we propose one of the early works of incremental
learning on ViTs architectures, comparing functional, weight and attention
regularization approaches and propose effective novel a novel asymmetric loss.
At the end we conclude with a study on pretraining and how it affects the
performance in Continual Learning, raising some questions about the effective
progression of the field. We then conclude with some future directions and
closing remarks.

  Analogously, continuous algebras are algebras enriched in $\mathsf{CPO}$, the
category of $\omega$-cpos, so that all operations are continuous. We introduce
equations between extended terms, and prove that varieties (classes presented

novel method for neural supersampling based on ray tracing 1/4-spp samples at

ensuring high quality standards and optimizing production performance. These
technologies have a long history of application in production and have had
numerous positive impacts, but also hold great potential when integrated with
Industry 4.0 and advanced machine learning, particularly deep learning,
solutions. However, in order to implement these solutions in production and
enable widespread adoption, the scalability and transferability of deep
learning methods have become a focus of research. While transfer learning has
proven successful in many cases, particularly with computer vision and
homogenous data inputs, it can be challenging to apply to heterogeneous data.
Motivated by the need to transfer and standardize established processes to
different, non-identical environments and by the challenge of adapting to
heterogeneous data representations, this work introduces the Domain Adaptation
Neural Network with Cyclic Supervision (DBACS) approach. DBACS addresses the
issue of model generalization through domain adaptation, specifically for
heterogeneous data, and enables the transfer and scalability of deep
learning-based statistical control methods in a general manner. Additionally,
the cyclic interactions between the different parts of the model enable DBACS
to not only adapt to the domains, but also match them. To the best of our
knowledge, DBACS is the first deep learning approach to combine adaptation and
matching for heterogeneous data settings. For comparison, this work also
includes subspace alignment and a multi-view learning that deals with
heterogeneous representations by mapping data into correlated latent feature
spaces. Finally, DBACS with its ability to adapt and match, is applied to a
virtual metrology use case for an etching process run on different machine
types in semiconductor manufacturing.

enabler to satisfy the requirements of communication and context-aware services

achieved based on delay and angle estimation using uplink or downlink pilot
signals. However, hardware impairments (HWIs) distort the signals at both the
transmitter and receiver sides and thus affect the localization performance.
While this impact can be ignored at lower frequencies where HWIs are less
severe, and the localization requirements are not stringent, modeling and
analysis efforts are needed for high-frequency 6G bands (e.g., sub-THz) to
assess degradation in localization accuracy due to HWIs. In this work, we model
various types of impairments for a sub-THz multiple-input-multiple-output
communication system and conduct a misspecified Cram\'er-Rao bound analysis to
evaluate HWI-induced performance losses in terms of angle/delay estimation and
the resulting 3D position/orientation estimation error. Complementary to the
localization analysis, we also investigate the effect of individual and overall
HWIs on communication in terms of symbol error rate (SER). Our extensive
simulation results demonstrate that each type of HWI leads to a different level
of degradation in angle and delay estimation performance. The prominent factors
on delay estimation (e.g., phase noise and carrier frequency offset) will have
a dominant negative effect on SER, while the impairments affecting only the
angle estimation (e.g., mutual coupling and antenna displacement) induce slight
degradation in SER performance.

air flows over an obstacle such as an aircraft wing or tree branch, these
particles may not follow the same paths as the air flowing around the obstacle.
Instead the particles in the air may deviate from the path of the air and so
collide with the surface of the obstacle. It is known that particle inertia can
drive this deposition, and that there is a critical value of this inertia,
below which no point particles deposit. Particle inertia is measured by the
Stokes number, St. We show that near the critical value of the Stokes number,
St$_c$, the amount of deposition has the unusual scaling law of
exp(-1/(St-St$_c$)$^{1/2}$). The scaling is controlled by the stagnation point
of the flow. This scaling is determined by the time for the particle to reach
the surface of the cylinder varying as 1/(St-St$_c$)$^{1/2}$, together with the
distance away from the stagnation point (perpendicular to the flow direction)
increasing exponentially with time. The scaling law applies to inviscid flow, a
model for flow at high Reynolds numbers. The unusual scaling means that the
amount of particles deposited increases only very slowly above the critical
Stokes number. This has consequences for applications ranging from rime

their demand for energy and compute resources. On a low level, the major part
of these resources is consumed by data movement between different memory units.
Modern hardware architectures contain a form of fast memory (e.g., cache,
registers), which is small, and a slow memory (e.g., DRAM), which is larger but
expensive to access. We can only process data that is stored in fast memory,
which incurs data movement (input/output-operations, or I/Os) between the two
units. In this paper, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the I/Os
needed in sparse feedforward neural network (FFNN) inference. We establish
bounds that determine the optimal number of I/Os up to a factor of 2 and
present a method that uses a number of I/Os within that range. Much of the
I/O-complexity is determined by a few high-level properties of the FFNN (number
of inputs, outputs, neurons, and connections), but if we want to get closer to
the exact lower bound, the instance-specific sparsity patterns need to be
considered. Departing from the 2-optimal computation strategy, we show how to
reduce the number of I/Os further with simulated annealing. Complementing this
result, we provide an algorithm that constructively generates networks with
maximum I/O-efficiency for inference. We test the algorithms and empirically
verify our theoretical and algorithmic contributions. In our experiments on
real hardware we observe speedups of up to 45$\times$ relative to the standard

uses molecules as information carriers, thereby requiring unconventional
transmitter/receiver architectures and modulation/detection techniques.
Practical MC receivers (MC-Rxs) can be implemented based on field-effect
transistor biosensor (bioFET) architectures, where surface receptors reversibly
react with ligands, whose concentration encodes the information. The
time-varying concentration of ligand-bound receptors is then translated into
electrical signals via field-effect, which is used to decode the transmitted
information. However, ligand-receptor interactions do not provide an ideal
molecular selectivity, as similar types of ligands, i.e., interferers,
co-existing in the MC channel can interact with the same type of receptors,
resulting in cross-talk. Overcoming this molecular cross-talk with time-domain
samples of the Rx's electrical output is not always attainable, especially when
Rx has no knowledge of the interferer statistics or it operates near
saturation. In this study, we propose a frequency-domain detection (FDD)
technique for bioFET-based MC-Rxs, which exploits the difference in binding
reaction rates of different types of ligands, reflected to the noise spectrum
of the ligand-receptor binding fluctuations. We analytically derive the bit
error probability (BEP) of the FDD technique, and demonstrate its effectiveness
in decoding transmitted concentration signals under stochastic molecular
interference, in comparison to a widely-used time-domain detection (TDD)
technique. The proposed FDD method can be applied to any biosensor-based
MC-Rxs, which employ receptor molecules as the channel-Rx interface.

These monotones yield infinite sequences of inequalities that must be satisfied

deriving an infinite sequence of ""Landauer inequalities"" for the work cost,
bounded by linear combinations of expectation values of powers of the modular
Hamiltonian. These inequalities give improved lower bounds for the work cost in
finite dimensional systems, and depend on more details of the erased state than
just on its entropy and variance of modular Hamiltonian. Similarly one can
derive lower bounds for marginal entropy production for a system coupled to an
environment. These infinite sequences of entanglement monotones also give rise
to relative quantifiers that are monotonic in more general processes, namely
those involving so-called $\sigma$-majorization with respect to a fixed point
full rank state $\sigma$; such quantifiers are called resource monotones. As an
application to thermodynamics, one can use them to derive finite-dimension
corrections to the Clausius inequality. Finally, in order to gain some
intuition for what (if anything) plays the role of majorization in field

evaluation of the most commonly used uncertainty and robustness methods for the
classification of Whole-Slide-Images under domain shift using the H\&E stained
Camelyon17 breast cancer dataset. Although it is known that histopathological
data can be subject to strong domain shift and label noise, to our knowledge
this is the first work that compares the most common methods for uncertainty
estimation under these aspects. In our experiments, we compare Stochastic
Variational Inference, Monte-Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles, Test-Time Data
Augmentation as well as combinations thereof. We observe that ensembles of
methods generally lead to higher accuracies and better calibration and that
Test-Time Data Augmentation can be a promising alternative when choosing an
appropriate set of augmentations. Across methods, a rejection of the most
uncertain tiles leads to a significant increase in classification accuracy on
both in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, we
conduct experiments comparing these methods under varying conditions of label
noise. We observe that the border regions of the Camelyon17 dataset are subject
to label noise and evaluate the robustness of the included methods against
different noise levels. Lastly, we publish our code framework to facilitate

threat. Uplink access jamming (UAJ) can increase the number of
dropped/retransmitted packets and restrict or prevent the normal device access.
To tackle this vital and challenging problem, we propose a novel UAJ detection
method based on the joint space-time sparsity (JSTS). Our key insight is that
the JSTS-based feature will be significantly impacted if UAJ happens, since
only a small fraction of the devices are active and the traffic pattern for
each device is sporadic in the normal state. Unlike the existing detection
methods under batch mode (i.e., all sample observations are collected before
making a decision), the JSTS-based detection is performed in a sequential
manner by processing the received signals one by one, which can detect UAJ as
quickly as possible. Moreover, the proposed JSTS-based method does not rely on
the prior knowledge of the attackers, since it only cares the abrupt change in
the JSTS-based feature on each frame. Numerical results evaluate and confirm
the effectiveness of our method.

as the scope of an object in an image given only the image-level labels. Most
of the existing works are based on Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and endeavor
to enlarge the discriminative area inside the activation map to perceive the
whole object, yet ignore the co-occurrence confounder of the object and context
(e.g., fish and water), which makes the model inspection hard to distinguish
object boundaries. Besides, the use of CAM also brings a dilemma problem that
the classification and localization always suffer from a performance gap and
can not reach their highest accuracy simultaneously. In this paper, we propose
a casual knowledge distillation method, dubbed KD-CI-CAM, to address these two
under-explored issues in one go. More specifically, we tackle the co-occurrence
context confounder problem via causal intervention (CI), which explores the
causalities among image features, contexts, and categories to eliminate the
biased object-context entanglement in the class activation maps. Based on the
de-biased object feature, we additionally propose a multi-teacher causal
distillation framework to balance the absorption of classification knowledge
and localization knowledge during model training. Extensive experiments on
several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of KD-CI-CAM in learning clear
object boundaries from confounding contexts and addressing the dilemma problem

explanations behind the formation of the sub-Jovian or Neptunian desert include
several scenarios that can lead to different shapes for the boundary,
predicting various dependencies between the position of the boundary and the
stellar parameters. Methods. We explored the exoplanet distribution in various
2D and 3D projections, revealing the stellar-dependent substructures in the
$P_{\rm orb}-M_{P}$ and the $P_{\rm orb}-R_{P}$ parameter plane. Results. We
demonstrate that the upper boundary includes a range of planets, namely,
inflated hot Jupiters and normal hot Jupiters, in the two parameter planes,
respectively. We confirm the dependence of the boundary on several stellar
parameters and, based on a fuzzy clustering analysis, we provide quantitative
formulae for the dependencies in groups of smaller and larger planets. The
overall period-radius distribution shows chemical substructures as well, with
the boundary being dependent on volatiles and alpha-elements, alongside
marginal (to none) dependence found for refractory elements. Conclusions. These
findings confirm multiple plausible causes for the formation of the desert,

fields, including finance, biology, chemistry, and network science. However, to
enable cycle enumeration in real-world applications, efficient parallel
algorithms are required. In this work, we propose scalable parallelisation of
state-of-the-art sequential algorithms for enumerating simple, temporal, and
hop-constrained cycles. First, we focus on the simple cycle enumeration problem
and parallelise the algorithms by Johnson and by Read and Tarjan in a
fine-grained manner. We theoretically show that our resulting fine-grained
parallel algorithms are scalable, with the fine-grained parallel Read-Tarjan
algorithm being strongly scalable. In contrast, we show that straightforward
coarse-grained parallel versions of these simple cycle enumeration algorithms
that exploit edge- or vertex-level parallelism are not scalable. Next, we adapt
our fine-grained approach to enable the enumeration of cycles under
time-window, temporal, and hop constraints. Our evaluation on a cluster with
256 CPU cores that can execute up to 1024 simultaneous threads demonstrates a
near-linear scalability of our fine-grained parallel algorithms when
enumerating cycles under the aforementioned constraints. On the same cluster,
our fine-grained parallel algorithms achieve, on average, one order of
magnitude speedup compared to the respective coarse-grained parallel versions
of the state-of-the-art algorithms for cycle enumeration. The performance gap
between the fine-grained and the coarse-grained parallel algorithms increases
as we use more CPU cores.

Perceivable Encoding Artifacts (PEAs), which dramatically degrade video visual
quality. Subjective and objective measures capable of identifying and
quantifying various types of PEAs are critical in improving visual quality. In
this paper, we investigate the influence of four spatial PEAs (i.e. blurring,
blocking, bleeding, and ringing) and two temporal PEAs (i.e. flickering and
floating) on video quality. For spatial artifacts, we propose a visual saliency
model with a low computational cost and higher consistency with human visual
perception. In terms of temporal artifacts, self-attention based TimeSFormer is
improved to detect temporal artifacts. Based on the six types of PEAs, a
quality metric called Saliency-Aware Spatio-Temporal Artifacts Measurement
(SSTAM) is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art metrics. We believe that SSTAM will be beneficial
for optimizing video coding techniques.

magnetic topological semimetals is attracting enormous interest due to its
fundamental importance and technological relevance. Mechanisms resulting in
large intrinsic AHE include diverging Berry curvature in Weyl semimetals,
anticrossing nodal rings or points of non-trivial bands, and noncollinear spin
structures. Here we show that a half-topological semimetal (HTS) state near a
topological critical point can provide a new mechanism for driving an
exceptionally large AHE. We reveal this through a systematic experimental and
theoretical study of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) half-Heusler compound TbPdBi.
We not only observed an unusual AHE with a surprisingly large anomalous Hall
angle {\Theta}H (tan {\Theta}H ~ 2, the largest among the antiferromagnets) in
its field-driven ferromagnetic (FM) phase, but also found a distinct Hall
resistivity peak in the canted AFM phase within a low field range, where its
isothermal magnetization is nearly linearly dependent on the field. Moreover,
we observed a nearly isotropic, giant negative magnetoresistance with a
magnitude of ~98%. Our in-depth theoretical modelling demonstrates that these
exotic transport properties originate from the HTS state. A minimal Berry
curvature cancellation between the trivial spin-up and nontrivial spin-down
bands results not only in an extremely large AHE, but it also enhances the spin
polarization of the spin-down bands substantially and thus leads to a giant
negative magnetoresistance. Our study advances the understanding of the
interplay between band topology and magnetism and offers new clues for
materials design for spintronics and other applications.

linearized massless gravity, using Dirac brackets, we recover the necessary

Hilbert space. This leads to split states, and consequently, one cannot use
asymptotic boundary observables to extract bulk information in massive gravity.
We also argue the split property directly without an explicit reference to the
Hilbert space. The result reflects that we can construct local bulk operators
in massive gravity, which are obscured from boundary observables due to the
lack of diffeomorphism invariance. Our analysis sheds some light on evaporating
black holes in the context of the islands proposal.

for high contraction force levels the Laplacian weight becomes weaker. The

develop a style encoder to extract dynamic facial motion patterns of a style
reference video and then encode them into a style code. Afterward, we introduce
a style-controllable decoder to synthesize stylized facial animations from the
speech content and style code. In order to integrate the reference speaking
style into generated videos, we design a style-aware adaptive transformer,
which enables the encoded style code to adjust the weights of the feed-forward
layers accordingly. Thanks to the style-aware adaptation mechanism, the
reference speaking style can be better embedded into synthesized videos during
decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is capable of
generating talking head videos with diverse speaking styles from only one

Learning (IL) presents a promising performance in a wide range of domains.
However, despite the considerable improvement in policy performance, the

Inspired by the recent approaches in explainable artificial intelligence
methods, we proposed a model-agnostic explaining framework for IL models called
R2RISE. R2RISE aims to explain the overall policy performance with respect to
the frames in demonstrations. It iteratively retrains the black-box IL model
from the randomized masked demonstrations and uses the conventional evaluation
outcome environment returns as the coefficient to build an importance map. We
also conducted experiments to investigate three major questions concerning
frames' importance equality, the effectiveness of the importance map, and
connections between importance maps from different IL models. The result shows
that R2RISE successfully distinguishes important frames from the
demonstrations.

human efforts in feature engineering, researchers propose several deep neural
networks (DNN)-based approaches to learn the feature interactions in an
end-to-end fashion. However, existing methods either do not learn both
vector-wise interactions and bit-wise interactions simultaneously, or fail to
combine them in a controllable manner. In this paper, we propose a new model,
xDeepInt, based on a novel network architecture called polynomial interaction
network (PIN) which learns higher-order vector-wise interactions recursively.
By integrating subspace-crossing mechanism, we enable xDeepInt to balance the
mixture of vector-wise and bit-wise feature interactions at a bounded order.
Based on the network architecture, we customize a combined optimization
strategy to conduct feature selection and interaction selection. We implement
the proposed model and evaluate the model performance on three real-world

xDeepInt over state-of-the-art models. We open-source the TensorFlow

$\nu>0$, we consider the Cauchy problem with initial vorticity $\omega_0$ that
represents an infinitely thin vortex filament of arbitrary given strength
$\Gamma$ supported on a circle. The vorticity field $\omega(x,t)$ of the
solution is smooth at any positive time and corresponds to a vortex ring of
thickness $\sqrt{\nu t}$ that is translated along its symmetry axis due to
self-induction, an effect anticipated by Helmholtz in 1858 and quantified by
Kelvin in 1867. For small viscosities, we show that $\omega(x,t)$ is
well-approximated on a large time interval by $\omega_{lin}(x-a(t),t)$, where
$\omega_{lin}(\cdot,t)=\exp(\nu t\Delta)\omega_0$ is the solution of the heat
equation with initial data $\omega_0$, and $\dot a(t)$ is the instantaneous
velocity given by Kelvin's formula. This gives a rigorous justification of the
binormal motion for circular vortex filaments in weakly viscous fluids. The
proof relies on the construction of a precise approximate solution, using a
perturbative expansion in self-similar variables. To verify the stability of
this approximation, one needs to rule out potential instabilities coming from
very large advection terms in the linearized operator. This is done by adapting
V. I. Arnold's geometric stability methods developed in the inviscid case
$\nu=0$ to the slightly viscous situation. It turns out that although the
geometric structures behind Arnold's approach are no longer preserved by the
equation for $\nu > 0$, the relevant quadratic forms behave well on larger
subspaces than those originally used in Arnold's theory and interact favorably
with the viscous terms.

water, from detection in the transmission spectra of exoplanets with
atmospheric temperatures < 800 K. The opacities of laboratory produced organic
compounds (tholins) from Khare et al. (1984) have become a standard for
modeling haze in exoplanet atmospheres. However, these tholins were grown in an
oxygen-free, Titan-like environment that is very different from typical
assumptions for exoplanets, where C/O~0.5. This work presents the 0.13-10
micron complex refractive indices derived from laboratory transmission
measurements of tholins grown in environments with different oxygen abundances.
With the increasing uptake of oxygen, absorption increases across the entire
wavelength range, and a scattering feature around 6 micron shifts towards
shorter wavelengths and becomes more peaked around 5.8 micron, due to a C=O
stretch resonance. Using GJ 1214b as a test-case, we examine the transmission
spectra of a sub-Neptune planet with C/O ratios of solar, 1, and 1000 to
evaluate the effective differences between our opacities and those of Khare.
For an atmosphere with solar hydrogen and helium abundances, we find a
difference of 200-1500 ppm, but for high-metallicity (Z=1000) environments, the
difference may only be 20 ppm. The 1-2 micron transmission data for GJ 1214b
rule out the Titan-like haze model, and are more consistent with C/O=1 and
C/O=solar haze models. This work demonstrates that using haze opacities that
are more consistent with underlying assumptions about bulk atmospheric
composition are important for building self-consistent models that
appropriately constrain the atmospheric C/O ratio, even when molecular features

that they are invariant under Darboux transformations, and they fully determine

this paper we introduce a new semi-analytical method to obtain the greybody

positive samples heavily depends on the carefully designed data augmentations,
while inappropriate data augmentations would easily lead to the semantic drift
and indiscriminative positive samples. 2) The constructed negative samples are
not reliable for ignoring important clustering information. To solve these
problems, we propose a Cluster-guided Contrastive deep Graph Clustering network
(CCGC) by mining the intrinsic supervision information in the high-confidence
clustering results. Specifically, instead of conducting complex node or edge
perturbation, we construct two views of the graph by designing special Siamese
encoders whose weights are not shared between the sibling sub-networks. Then,
guided by the high-confidence clustering information, we carefully select and
construct the positive samples from the same high-confidence cluster in two
views. Moreover, to construct semantic meaningful negative sample pairs, we
regard the centers of different high-confidence clusters as negative samples,
thus improving the discriminative capability and reliability of the constructed
sample pairs. Lastly, we design an objective function to pull close the samples
from the same cluster while pushing away those from other clusters by
maximizing and minimizing the cross-view cosine similarity between positive and
negative samples. Extensive experimental results on six datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of CCGC compared with the existing state-of-the-art

for a wide variety of tasks. The rise and development of machine learning and
deep learning models have created many opportunities to improve our modeling
toolbox. Breakthroughs in these fields often come with the requirement of large
amounts of data. Such large datasets are often not publicly available in
finance and insurance, mainly due to privacy and ethics concerns. This lack of
data is currently one of the main hurdles in developing better models. One
possible option to alleviating this issue is generative modeling. Generative
models are capable of simulating fake but realistic-looking data, also referred
to as synthetic data, that can be shared more freely. Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) is such a model that increases our capacity to fit very
high-dimensional distributions of data. While research on GANs is an active
topic in fields like computer vision, they have found limited adoption within
the human sciences, like economics and insurance. Reason for this is that in
these fields, most questions are inherently about identification of causal
effects, while to this day neural networks, which are at the center of the GAN
framework, focus mostly on high-dimensional correlations. In this paper we
study the causal preservation capabilities of GANs and whether the produced
synthetic data can reliably be used to answer causal questions. This is done by
performing causal analyses on the synthetic data, produced by a GAN, with
increasingly more lenient assumptions. We consider the cross-sectional case,
the time series case and the case with a complete structural model. It is shown
that in the simple cross-sectional scenario where correlation equals causation
the GAN preserves causality, but that challenges arise for more advanced
analyses.

methods for patch assessment involve generating new tests or manual inspection,
which can be time-consuming or biased. In this paper, we propose a novel
technique, INVALIDATOR, to automatically assess the correctness of
APR-generated patches via semantic and syntactic reasoning. INVALIDATOR
leverages program invariants to reason about program semantics while also
capturing program syntax through language semantics learned from a large code
corpus using a pre-trained language model. Given a buggy program and the
developer-patched program, INVALIDATOR infers likely invariants on both
programs. Then, INVALIDATOR determines that an APR-generated patch overfits if:
(1) it violates correct specifications or (2) maintains erroneous behaviors
from the original buggy program. In case our approach fails to determine an
overfitting patch based on invariants, INVALIDATOR utilizes a trained model
from labeled patches to assess patch correctness based on program syntax. The
benefit of INVALIDATOR is threefold. First, INVALIDATOR leverages both semantic
and syntactic reasoning to enhance its discriminative capability. Second,
INVALIDATOR does not require new test cases to be generated, but instead only
relies on the current test suite and uses invariant inference to generalize
program behaviors. Third, INVALIDATOR is fully automated. Experimental results
demonstrate that INVALIDATOR outperforms existing methods in terms of Accuracy
and F-measure, correctly identifying 79% of overfitting patches and detecting
23% more overfitting patches than the best baseline.

instability or the limiting point instability for a class of free energy
functions. A weakly nonlinear analysis is then conducted and it is shown that
the near-critical behavior is described by a fourth order nonlinear ODE with
variable coefficients. This amplitude equation is solved using the finite
difference method and it is demonstrated that a localised solution does indeed
bifurcate from the homogeneous solution. Based on this analysis and what is
already known for the purely mechanical case, we may deduce that the necking
evolution follows the same three stages of initiation, growth and propagation
as other similar localisation problems. The insight provided by the current
study is expected to be relevant in assessing the integrity of dielectric
elastomer actuators.

a crystalline lattice there can exist regions of disorder, such as dislocation
networks or grain boundaries. The cores of these regions of disorder are

atoms, then the fluid-like aggregations inside the regions of disorder can
exhibit Bose-Einstein condensation and hence superfluidity. The regions of
disorder are randomly distributed throughout the sample, so that for describing
the overall properties of the solid requires to accomplish averaging over the

task freeing people from heavy annotation work. However, domain discrepancies
in low-level image statistics and high-level contexts compromise the
segmentation performance over the target domain. A key idea to tackle this
problem is to perform both image-level and feature-level adaptation jointly.
Unfortunately, there is a lack of such unified approaches for UDA tasks in the
existing literature. This paper proposes a novel UDA pipeline for semantic
segmentation that unifies image-level and feature-level adaptation. Concretely,
for image-level domain shifts, we propose a global photometric alignment module
and a global texture alignment module that align images in the source and
target domains in terms of image-level properties. For feature-level domain
shifts, we perform global manifold alignment by projecting pixel features from
both domains onto the feature manifold of the source domain; and we further
regularize category centers in the source domain through a category-oriented
triplet loss and perform target domain consistency regularization over
augmented target domain images. Experimental results demonstrate that our
pipeline significantly outperforms previous methods. In the commonly tested
GTA5$\rightarrow$Cityscapes task, our proposed method using Deeplab V3+ as the

graph learning tasks. To achieve better fitting capability, most GNNs are with
a large number of parameters, which makes these GNNs computationally expensive.
Therefore, it is difficult to deploy them onto edge devices with scarce
computational resources, e.g., mobile phones and wearable smart devices.
Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a common solution to compress GNNs, where a
light-weighted model (i.e., the student model) is encouraged to mimic the
behavior of a computationally expensive GNN (i.e., the teacher GNN model).
Nevertheless, most existing GNN-based KD methods lack fairness consideration.
As a consequence, the student model usually inherits and even exaggerates the
bias from the teacher GNN. To handle such a problem, we take initial steps
towards fair knowledge distillation for GNNs. Specifically, we first formulate
a novel problem of fair knowledge distillation for GNN-based teacher-student
frameworks. Then we propose a principled framework named RELIANT to mitigate
the bias exhibited by the student model. Notably, the design of RELIANT is
decoupled from any specific teacher and student model structures, and thus can
be easily adapted to various GNN-based KD frameworks. We perform extensive
experiments on multiple real-world datasets, which corroborates that RELIANT
achieves less biased GNN knowledge distillation while maintaining high
prediction utility.

low-mass Population III supernovae in a cosmological minihalo, and provide a
tentative lower mass limit on host minihaloes that can recollapse on a short
enough timescale and efficiently mix metals at high densities. We start from
cosmological initial conditions and end the simulation when the central density
undergoes catastrophic recollapse, whereby the water abundance is reported.
During the Population III stars lifetime, the minihalo (M$ = 5 \times 10^5$
M$_{\odot}$) becomes blown out, and consequently the faint supernova explosion
(E$_{\mathrm{SN}} = 5\times 10^{50}$ ergs) is completely unconfined to the
virial radius of the minihalo. At the end of the simulation there is no
significant water formation anywhere throughout the remnant, and the central
recollapsing region is inefficient at incorporating the first metals into
itself, remaining at low metallicity. The majority of metals are ejected from
the core via bipolar outflow into the void and reach a peak metallicity of
$\mathrm{Z} \sim 10^{-6}\ \mathrm{Z}_{\odot}$ at very low densities. The mass
of the minihalo is low enough such that the recollapse timescale is
unreasonable for this configuration to be the primary avenue of water formation
in the early universe. We also provide a comparison with a regular CCSN
(E$_{\mathrm{SN}} = 10^{51}$ ergs) and find the same effect, but amplified. As
such, we can suggest that the minimum minihalo mass required for a confined
explosion, and therefore the possibility of water formation is at least
$10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$ and the chemo-thermal evolution of a supernova remnant is
more sensitive to the mass of the host minihalo than the mass of the Population
III star residing within it.

relationship between support/query features based on a Transformer-like
framework. Our key insights are two folds: Firstly, with the aid of support
masks, we can generate dynamic class centers more appropriately to re-weight
query features. Secondly, we find that support object queries have already
encoded key factors after base training. In this way, the query features can be
enhanced twice from two aspects, i.e., feature-level and instance-level. In
particular, we firstly design a mask-based dynamic weighting module to enhance
support features and then propose to link object queries for better calibration
via cross-attention. After the above steps, the novel classes can be improved
significantly over our strong baseline. Additionally, our new framework can be
easily extended to incremental FSIS with minor modification. When benchmarking
results on the COCO dataset for FSIS, gFSIS, and iFSIS settings, our method

under additional assumptions. We deduce various explicit irrationality
measures, in particular for values of the exponential and Bessel's J0 function
at non-zero algebraic points. We also prove that the values at rational points
of E-functions with rational Taylor coefficients are linearly independent over
the field of algebraic numbers if and only if they are linearly independent
over Q. Our methods rest upon improvements of results recently obtained by
Andr{\'e} and Beukers by means of the theory of E-operators.

gravity with functional form $f(R, T)$=$f_1(R)$+$f_2(T)$ where $R$ is Ricci
scalar, and $T$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor. With this
functional form, three different cases have been formulated, namely negative
and positive powers of curvature, logarithmic curvature, and exponential
curvature given by $f_1(R)=R+\gamma R^2-\frac{\mu^4}{R}$, $f_1(R)=R+\nu ln(\tau

$f_2(T)=\lambda T$, here $\gamma$, $\lambda$, $\mu$, $\nu$, $\tau$, $\kappa$

i) the Expansion scalar is proportional to shear scalar ii) the Hyperbolic
scale factor is used. By using these conditions, the required optimum solutions
are obtained. The physical parameters are calculated, and the geometrical
parameters of three cases are analyzed against redshift($z$) with the help of
pictorial representation. In the context of $f(R, T)$ gravity, energy
conditions are discussed with the help of pressure and energy density. If a
strong energy condition is positive, gravity should be attractive but in our
model, it shows negative, which means that cosmic acceleration is due to
antigravity, whereas NEC and DEC are fulfilled. The perturbation technique is
used to test the stability of the background solutions of the obtained models.
The inferences obtained from this paper are persistent with the present

absorption of the molecularly thin 2D absorber would be one of the key limiting
factors in device efficiency, and conventional photon management techniques are
not necessarily compatible with them. In this paper, we show two semimetal
composite nanostructures for synergistic photon management and strain-induced
band gap engineering of 2D MoS2: (1) pseudo-periodic Sn nanodots, (2)
conductive SnOx (x<1) core-shell nanoneedle structures. Without sophisticated
nanolithography, both nanostructures are self-assembled from physical vapor
deposition. 2D MoS2 achieves up to >15x enhancement in absorption at
{\lambda}=650-950 nm under Sn nanodots, and 20-30x at {\lambda}=700-900 nm
under SnOx (x<1) nanoneedles, both spanning from visible to near infrared
regime. Enhanced absorption in MoS2 results from strong near field enhancement
and reduced MoS2 band gap due to the tensile strain induced by the Sn
nanostructures, as confirmed by Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopy.
Especially, we demonstrate that up to 3.5% biaxial tensile strain is introduced
to 2D MoS2 using conductive nanoneedle-structured SnOx (x<1), which reduces the
band gap by ~0.35 eV to further enhance light absorption at longer wavelengths.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a synergistic
triple-functional photon management, stressor, and conductive electrode layer
on 2D MoS2. Such synergistic photon management and band gap engineering
approach for extended spectral response can be further applied to other 2D
materials for future 2D photonic devices.

When a molecular state composed of two consistent hadrons is attacked by
another particle, one of the constituents should be kicked out while another
quasifree constituent stays almost unaffected. It is different from a compact
multiquark which has no obvious subcluster. In this work, taking the $X(3872)$
as an example, we perform a Dalitz plot analysis of such reaction to find the
effect of the different internal structures. Under the assumption of the
$X(3872)$ as a molecular state or a compact tetraquark state, with the help of
the effective Lagrangians, the Dalitz plot and the invariant mass spectrum are
estimated with different total invariant mass of three final particles, and the
effect of different binding energies is also discussed. Obvious event
concentration can be observed as strips in the Dalitz plot and sharp peaks in
the invariant mass spectrum for the $X(3872)$ with a small binding energy under
the molecular state picture, while such concentration cannot be observed under
the compact tetraquark picture. Such phenomenon can be applied to identify the
internal structure of a new hadron state.

exponential speedup in finding good element(s) from an unstructured database.
Using the labels and the associated possible solutions as input, the VQS can
find all feasible solutions to the vertex coloring problem. The number of
qubits and the circuit depth required by the QFL each is a polynomial function
of the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the number of colors of a
vertex coloring problem. The QFL together with the VQS could be the first

VQS is proved to be efficient for any number of qubits.

dimensions to perform accurate analysis by adopting a distributed ledger
technology. Our work analyses the current state-of-the-art of fish farming and
proposes a fish farm ecosystem that relies on a private-by-design architecture
based on the Hyperledger Fabric private-permissioned distributed ledger
technology. The proposed method puts forward accurate and secure storage of the
retrieved data from multiple sensors across the ecosystem so that the adhering
entities can exercise their decision based on the acquired data. This study
demonstrates a proof-of-concept to signify the efficiency and usability of the
future fish farm.

for study of the Big Bang problem. Moreover, the very possibility of studying
the state of the Universe at the highest temperatures appears. In the 2D and 4D
lattice theories of gravity, the existence of a high-temperature phase is
proved, which is characterized by the folding of space into a point and zeroing
of the energy-momentum tensor. This fact leads to the hypothesis that there are
at least two phases in the 4D lattice theory, and the main properties of the
high-temperature phase are similar to those described above. The solution of
the Einstein equation in the low temperature phase within the framework of the
Friedmann paradigm with a finite bare cosmological constant is mathematically
correct, since all local physical quantities (energy density including vacuum
energy, etc.) on the lattice are finite. As a result, a solution is obtained
that demonstrates an exponential growth of the cosmological scale factor $a(t)$
in the initial period of evolution (inflation phase of the Universe) and then
passes into a power law ($a(t)\propto\sqrt{t}$).

via seizure episodes. Epileptic seizures are commonly monitored through
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings due to their routine and low expense
collection. The stochastic nature of EEG makes seizure identification via
manual inspections performed by highly-trained experts a tedious endeavor,
motivating the use of automated identification. The literature on automated
identification focuses mostly on supervised learning methods requiring expert
labels of EEG segments that contain seizures, which are difficult to obtain.
Motivated by these observations, we pose seizure identification as an
unsupervised anomaly detection problem. To this end, we employ the first
unsupervised transformer-based model for seizure identification on raw EEG. We
train an autoencoder involving a transformer encoder via an unsupervised loss
function, incorporating a novel masking strategy uniquely designed for
multivariate time-series data such as EEG. Training employs EEG recordings that
do not contain any seizures, while seizures are identified with respect to
reconstruction errors at inference time. We evaluate our method on three
publicly available benchmark EEG datasets for distinguishing seizure vs.
non-seizure windows. Our method leads to significantly better seizure
identification performance than supervised learning counterparts, by up to 16%
recall, 9% accuracy, and 9% Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics
Curve (AUC), establishing particular benefits on highly imbalanced data.
Through accurate seizure identification, our method could facilitate widely

derived two modes for modeling dynamic higher-order interactions: dynamic

adjust the strength of learned interactions by instance-aware activation gating
networks. In dynamic parameter mode, we re-parameterize the parameters by
different formulations and dynamically generate the parameters by
instance-aware parameter generation networks. Through instance-aware gating

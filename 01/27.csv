  front-end electronics",,,,,"physics.ins-det","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper describes the fundamental timing properties of a single-pixel
sensor for charged particle detection based on the 3D-trench silicon structure.
We derive the results both analytically and numerically by considering a simple
ideal sensor and the corresponding fast front-end electronics in two different
case scenarios: ideal integrator and real fast electronics (trans-impedance
amplifier). The particular shape of the Time of Arrival (TOA) distribution is
examined and the relation between the time resolution and the spread of
intrinsic charge collection time is discussed, by varying electronics
parameters and discrimination thresholds. The results are obtained with and
without simulated electronics noise. We show that the 3D-trench sensors are
characterized by a $synchronous~region$, i.e. a portion of the active volume
which leads to the same TOA values when charged particles cross it. The
synchronous region size is dependent on the front-end electronics and
discrimination threshold, and the phenomenon represents an intrinsic physical
effect that leads to the excellent time resolution of these sensors. Moreover,
we show that the TOA distribution is characterized by an intrinsic asymmetry,
due to the 3D geometry only, that becomes negligible in case of significant
electronics jitter.

of a class of homogeneous solutions to the relativistic Euler equations on
fixed linearly expanding cosmological spacetimes with a linear equation of
state $p=K \rho$ for the parameter values $K \in (0,1/3)$. This removes the
restriction to irrotational perturbations in earlier work, and relies on a
novel transformation of the fluid variables that is well-adapted to Fuchsian
methods. We then apply this new transformation to show the global regularity
and stability of the Milne spacetime under the coupled Einstein--Euler
equations, again with a linear equation of state $p=K \rho$, $K \in (0,1/3)$.
Our proof requires a correction mechanism to account for the spatially curved
geometry. In total, this is indicative that structure formation in cosmological
fluid-filled spacetimes requires an epoch of decelerated expansion.

contaminated by central AGNs within the XXL survey footprint and provide a

supplementary optical and infrared information. We present 33 AC objects,
including 25 clusters in the redshift range, $0.14 \leq z \leq 1.03$, and eight
other sources with significantly peaked central profiles. Six of these are new
confirmed clusters. We computed the missed fraction of the XXL survey, which is
defined as the fraction of genuine clusters that are undetected due to their
centrally peaked X-ray profiles. We report seven undetected AC clusters above
$z > 0.6$, in the range where X-ray cluster detection efficiency drops
significantly. The missed fraction is estimated to be at the level of $5\%$ for
the 50 square-degree XXL area. The impact on cosmological estimates from missed
clusters is negligible for XXL, but it produces a tension of $\sim 3\sigma$
with the fiducial cosmology when considering larger survey areas. Looking
towards surveys such as eROSITA and \textit{Athena}, larger areas and increased

methods for characterising AGN contamination will be crucial for precise
cluster cosmology, particularly in the redshift $z > 1$ regime.

on existing discrepancies between observed and predicted isotopic abundances

role in the determination of the $s$-process production of $^{94}$Mo in AGB
stars, which presently cannot be reproduced by state-of-the-art stellar models.
There are no previous $^{94}$Nb($n$,$\gamma$) experimental data for the
resolved and unresolved resonance regions mainly due to the difficulties in
producing high-quality samples and also due to limitations in conventional
detection systems commonly used in time-of-flight experiments.Motivated by this
situation, a first measurement of the $^{94}$Nb($n$,$\gamma$) reaction was
carried out at CERN n\_TOF, thereby exploiting the high luminosity of the EAR2
area in combination with a new detection system of small-volume C6D6-detectors
and a high quality $^{94}$Nb-sample. The latter was based on hyper-pure
$^{93}$Nb material activated at the high-flux reactor of ILL-Grenoble. An
innovative ring-configuration detection system in close geometry around the

the beta approximation of the meta distribution. Our numerical results show
that deploying UAVs in wireless networks in most cases can greatly improve the

establishing LoS links is not always beneficial since it also increases the
interference. For instance, with the increase of the SINR threshold, the system
reliability of a high LoS probability environment decreases dramatically and it
is even lower than a low LoS probability environment. We also show that in

Born-Oppenheimer parameter $\kappa=(m/M)^{1/4}$, and what the correlation is
between angular momentum quantum numbers in the various representations. These
questions are addressed both in problems involving a single potential energy
surface, and those with multiple, strongly coupled surfaces; and both in the
electrostatic model and those for which fine structure and electron spin are
important. The analysis leads to an examination of the transformation laws
under rotations of the electronic Hamiltonian; of the basis states, both
adiabatic and diabatic, along with their phase conventions; of the potential
energy matrix; and of the derivative couplings. These transformation laws are
placed in the geometrical context of the structures in the nuclear
configuration space that are induced by rotations, which include the rotational
orbits or fibers, the surfaces upon which the orientation of the molecule
changes but not its shape; and the section, an initial value surface that cuts
transversally through the fibers. Finally, it is suggested that the usual

energy-momentum conservation and matter-current conservation in general and
hence, permits a process of matter creation/annihilation in an expanding
universe. Consequently, the scale factor dependencies of the energy densities
are modified by the dimensionless model parameter $\alpha$. We revisit some

spatially flat static universe, de Sitter expansion by negative vacuum energy,
steady state universes in the presence of arbitrary fluids with constant

Depending on the value of $\alpha$, dust/radiation dominated universe exhibits

  We also extend above MIS and MM algorithms to work with linear global memory.
Specifically, we show that both problems can be solved in deterministic time
$O(\min(\log n, \log \lambda \cdot \log \log n))$, and even in $O(\log \log n)$
time for graphs with arboricity at most $\log^{O(1)} \log n$. In this setting,
only a $O(\log^2 \log n)$-running time bound for trees was known due to Latypov
and Uitto [ArXiv'21].
  Vertex Coloring: We present a $O(1)$-round deterministic algorithm for the
problem of $O(\lambda)$-coloring in linear-memory MPC with relaxed global
memory of $n \cdot poly(\lambda)$ that solves the problem after just one single
graph partitioning step. This matches the state-of-the-art randomized round
complexity by Ghaffari and Sayyadi [ICALP'19] and improves upon the
deterministic $O(\lambda^{\epsilon})$-round algorithm by Barenboim and Khazanov
[CSR'18].

called Inflation and Interest Rate Targeting, IRT. With that and perfect
credibility, the theory of the price level and inflation only needs the Fisher
equation, but it interprets causality in a new sense: if the monetary authority
raises the policy rate, it will raise the inflation target, and vice versa,
given the natural interest rate. If credibility is not perfect or if
expectations are not completely rational, the theory needs something more. Here
I present a model corresponding to this theory that includes both the steady
state case and the recovery dynamics after a supply shock, with and without
policy reactions to such a shock. But, under the finite horizon assumption for
IRT, at some future point in time the money supply must become exogenous. This
creates the incentive for agents to examine, as of today, statistics on
monetary aggregates and form their forecasts of money supply growth and
inflation rates. Additionally, inflation models of the small open economy allow
us to deduce that the IRT in this case is much more powerful than otherwise,
and for the same degree of credibility. But things are not necessarily easier
for the monetary authority: it must monitor not only internal indicators, but
also external inflation and its determinants, and it must, in certain
circumstances, make more intense adjustments to the interest rate.

energy transmission methods are proposed to transmit offshore energy onshore,
considering the capital/operation costs for related energy conversion and
transmission facilities. The first method that deploys power cables only is a
benchmark method. The other two methods utilize a hydrogen supercenter (HSC)
and transmit offshore energy to and onshore substation through hydrogen
pipelines. For the second method, electrolyzers are placed at offshore wind
farms connected to HSC with low-pressure hydrogen pipelines. For the third
method, offshore wind power is distributed to the HSC and then converted into
hydrogen using electrolyzers placed at the HSC. An offshore scenario including
three wind farms located in the Gulf of Mexico and one onshore substation is
used as the base test case. Numerical simulations are conducted over a planning
period of 30 years using the proposed optimization models for each method
separately. Simulation results show that the proposed hydrogen-based methods
can effectively transmit offshore energy to the onshore substation. The
distances between the wind farms can influence the selection and configuration
of the offshore wind energy system. Moreover, the proposed study analyzes the
cost and benefits for various systems with different energy carriers. It can
also suggest which method could be the best candidate for offshore energy
delivery system under which scenario and demonstrate a promising future for
offshore wind power generation.

It has been a challenging task, however, to detect and visualize these coherent
states. We address, by means of stereoscopic particle image velocimetry, that
issue with the help of a large diameter (6 inches) pipe loop, which allowed us
to probe for coherent states at various moderate Reynolds numbers (5300 < Re <
29000)). Although these states have been observed at flow regimes around
laminar-turbulent transition (Re $\approx$ 2300) and also at high Reynolds
number pipe flow (Re $\approx$ 35000), at moderate Reynolds numbers their
existence had not been observed yet by experiment. By conditionally averaging
the flow fields with respect to their dominant azimuthal wavenumber of
streamwise velocity streaks, we have been able to uncover the existence of ten
well-defined coherent flow patterns. It turns out, as a remarkable phenomenon,
that their occurrence probabilities and the total number of dominant modes do
not essentially change as the Reynolds number is varied. Their occurrence
probabilities are noted to be reasonably well described by a Poisson
distribution, which suggests that low-speed streaks are created as a Poisson
process on the pipe circular geometry.

that even in the absence of the magnetic field, the scattering efficiency can

the effective damping parameters of the generators in the grid. In this paper,
we present and analyse the problem of tuning damping parameters when there is

compressible mutually noninteracting fluids and a shell of Koiter type
encompassing a time dependent 3D domain filled by the fluids. The dynamics of
the fluids is modelled by a system resembilng compressible Navier-Stokes
equations with a physically realistic pressure depending on densities of both
the fluids. In fact in the present article the dependence of the fluid pressure
on the densities is analogous to the ones considered in \cite{NovoPoko} (where
the authors deal with a bi-fluid system in a time independent smooth domain).
The shell constitutes the boundary of the fluid domain and it possesses a
non-linear, non-convex Koiter energy (of a quite general form). We are
interested in the existence of a weak solution to the system until the
time-dependent boundary approaches a self-intersection or the Koiter energy
degenerates. We first prove a global existence result when the adiabatic
exponents solve $\max\{\gamma, \beta\}>2$ and $\min\{\gamma,\beta\}>0,$ further
the densities are comparable and the structure involved is non-dissipative.
Next with the assumption that the structure is dissipative we extend our global
existence result to the critical case $\max\{\gamma,\beta\}\geq 2$ and
$\min\{\gamma,\beta\}>0.$ The result is achieved in several steps involving,
extension of the physical domain, penalization of the interface condition,
artificial regularization of the shell energy, added structural dissipation and
suitable limit passages depending on uniform estimates. In order to deal with
the bi-fluid system we generalize the almost compactness argument developed in
\cite{NovoPoko, Vasseur} to the case of time dependent domains with uniform
H\""{o}lder continuous boundaries. Moreover, the proof of such a compactness
result depends on the existence of renormalized continuity equation in time
dependent domains.

massless particles, and whose correlation functions directly lead to simple,
compact formulae for scattering amplitudes and loop integrands for massless
gauge and gravity theories. This article extends this framework to worldsheet
models for massive particles in 4d, obtained via a symmetry reduction of a
higher dimensional massless model. The target space of the resulting models
turns out to be the phase space of 4d massive particles in a twistorial
representation, and so the worldsheet theory agrees with the two-twistor string
previously introduced by the authors. However, the paper has been written so as
to be largely self-contained. We discuss two interesting classes of massive
theories in detail. For gauge theories, the reduction procedure is explicitly
adapted to supersymmetric gauge theories on the Coulomb branch. For
supergravity theories, the reduction is adapted to give theories obtained via
Cremmer, Scherk and Schwartz (CSS) reduction, with broken supersymmetry and
massive multiplets. The reduction procedure gives explicit and systematic rules
to obtain amplitudes for all these theories and their amplitudes from two
compact master formulae that have their origins in 6d based on the polarized
scattering equations; in the CSS case the formulae are new, and in both cases
their derivation is systematic. The freedom to include mass allows the
definition of a loop insertion operator, thereby extending the formulae to
1-loop. Unlike the massless 4d twistorial models, these all display a perfect
double copy structure, here incorporating massive particles in the relationship
between gauge theory and CSS supergravity amplitudes.

given in [Cam95] for $X$ compact.
  In the normal quasi-projective case, the \'etale Galois cover of $X$
associated to the nilpotent completion of $\pi_1(X)$ is thus holomorphically
convex. This is proved in the smooth case by $3$ other methods in [GGK22],

that its attributes are not fully understood. To close this gap, we present
BiBench, a rigorously designed benchmark with in-depth analysis for network
binarization. We first carefully scrutinize the requirements of binarization in
the actual production and define evaluation tracks and metrics for a
comprehensive and fair investigation. Then, we evaluate and analyze a series of
milestone binarization algorithms that function at the operator level and with
extensive influence. Our benchmark reveals that 1) the binarized operator has a
crucial impact on the performance and deployability of binarized networks; 2)
the accuracy of binarization varies significantly across different learning
tasks and neural architectures; 3) binarization has demonstrated promising
efficiency potential on edge devices despite the limited hardware support. The
results and analysis also lead to a promising paradigm for accurate and

singular terms usually not taken into account in phenomenological constitutive

terms of the microscopic parameters of the model. The predictions of this
microscopically grounded constitutive model have several qualitative features
that are specific to the rheology of soft suspensions measured in experiments
or simulations. The model shows a typical behavior of polymeric visco-elastic
materials, such as normal stress differences quadratic in the shear rate
$\dot\gamma$, as well as typical behaviors of suspensions of stiff particles,
such as a particle pressure linear in $\dot\gamma$ and a zero-shear viscosity
diverging at the jamming transition. The model also predicts a sharper shear
thinning than other visco-elastic models at small shear rates, in qualitative
agreement with experimental observations. Furthermore the shear thinning
follows a critical scaling close to the jamming transition.

main difficulty of this problem is the coupling of the shallow-water equations
with the viscoplastic constitutive laws and the high computational effort
needed in its solution. Although there have been many studies of this problem,
most of these works use explicit methods with simplified empirical models. In
our work, to accommodate non-uniform grids and complicated geometries, we use
the discontinuous Galerkin method to solve shallow viscoplastic flows. This
method is attractive due to its high parallelization, h- and p-adaptivity, and
ability to capture shocks. Additionally, we treat the discontinuities in the
interfaces between elements with numerical fluxes that ensure a stable solution
of the nonlinear hyperbolic equations. To couple the Bingham model with the
shallow-water equations, we regularize the problem with three alternatives.
Finally, in order to show the effectiveness of our approach, we perform
numerical examples for the usual benchmarks of the shallow-water equations.

fraction of the patterned region. At low packing fractions, the SPPs are
excluded from the system's center and exhibit a vortical motion that is
dominated by the substrate at intermediate values of $F_D$. This exclusion zone
is due to the coupling between the driving force and torque induced by the
substrate, which induces an outward spiral motion of the SPPs. For high values
of $F_D$, the SPPs exclusion from the center is dominated by the confining

alternative, proposed by Refsdal in 1964, relies on the inverse scaling of H0
with the delay between the arrival times of at least two images of a
strongly-lensed variable source such as a quasar. To date, Refsdal's method has
mostly been applied to quasars lensed by individual galaxies rather than by
galaxy clusters. Using the three quasars strongly lensed by galaxy clusters
(SDSS J1004+4112, SDSS J1029+2623, and SDSS J2222+2745) that have both
multiband Hubble Space Telescope data and published time delay measurements, we
derive H0, accounting for the systematic and statistical sources of
uncertainty. While a single time delay measurement does not yield a
well-constrained H0 value, analyzing the systems together tightens the
constraint. Combining the six time delays measured in the three cluster-lensed
quasars gives H0 = 71.5 +/- 6.1 km/s/Mpc. To reach 1% uncertainty in H0, we
estimate that a sample size of order of 500 time delay measurements of similar

extracting the divergence via different approximations over a range pf averaged

to correct the peculiar redshifts of the last SNIA compilation Pantheon+. The
results have intriguing implications for the LLSS fluid dynamics and
particularly for the ``Tilted Cosmology'' model, although those results have to
be taken carefully as the velocity field could contain significant bias due to
the reconstruction procedure. Those possible bias and its influence in our

A = \mathbb{Z}^d$ then there exists a periodic $A' \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^d$ such

conjecture in high dimensions due to Greenfeld and Tao motivates finding
different generalizations of Newman's theorem and of Bhattacharya's theorem
that hold in arbitrary dimension $d$. In this paper, we formulate and prove
such generalizations. We do so by studying the structure of joint co-tiles in
$\mathbb{Z}^d$. Our generalization of Newman's theorem states that for any $d
\ge 1$, any joint co-tile for $d$ independent tiles is periodic. For a
$(d-1)$-tuple of finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ that satisfy a certain
technical condition that we call property $(\star)$, we prove that any joint
co-tile decomposes into disjoint $(d-1)$-periodic sets. Consequently, we show
that for a $(d-1)$-tuple of finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ that satisfy
property $(\star)$, the existence of a joint co-tile implies the existence of
periodic joint co-tile. Conversely, we prove that if a finite subset $F$ in
$\mathbb{Z}^d$ admits a periodic co-tile $A$, then there exist $(d-1)$
additional tiles that together with $F$ are independent and admit $A$ as a
joint co-tile, and $(d-2)$ additional tiles that together with $F$ satisfy the
property $(\star)$. Combined, our results give a new necessary and sufficient

tilings and joint tilings in other countable abelian groups.

physiological functions and are linked to several pathological processes.
Poro-elastic modeling represents a promising approach because it allows the
integration of multiscale/multiphysics data to probe biologically relevant
phenomena at a smaller scale and embeds the relevant mechanisms at the larger
scale. The implementation of multi-phasic flow poro-elastic models however is a
complex undertaking, requiring extensive knowledge. The open-source software
FEniCSx Project provides a novel tool for the automated solution of partial
differential equations by the finite element method. This paper aims to provide
the required tools to model the mixed formulation of poro-elasticity, from the
theory to the implementation, within FEniCSx. Several benchmark cases are
studied. A column under confined compression conditions is compared to the
Terzaghi analytical solution, using the L2-norm. An implementation of
poro-hyper-elasticity is proposed. A bi-compartment column is compared to
previously published results (Cast3m implementation). For all cases, accurate
results are obtained in terms of a normalized Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
Furthermore, the FEniCSx computation is found three times faster than the
legacy FEniCS one. The benefits of parallel computation are also highlighted.

clock transition rates with classically exchanged signals. We propose an
experimental scheme for the quantum test of LPI: an internal atomic clock
interferometer comprising two interfering clocks within one atom. We prepare
the atom in a superposition of two clock states and one ground state, which
evolves coherently along two quantum clock oscillations into stable internal
Ramsey interference patterns. The interference pattern with the shared ground
state shows a visibility modulation, which can be interpreted as the beating of
the individual clock oscillations and a direct consequence of complementarity.
Upon the interferometer experiencing a different gravitational potential, LPI
predicts that both clock tick rates will change proportionally, while quantum
complementarity indicates that the visibility modulation should modify
accordingly. This change is deemed insignificant for the first period of
visibility modulation but can be stacked up until the limit of the system
coherence time. Since no splitting or recombining is involved, the system
coherence time can be as long as the trap lifetime or the clock state lifetime.
The required resolution to observe the visibility modulation is within reach of
the state-of-art optical clocks' sensitivities. This experimental scheme is
feasible in different scenarios, still or with speed, and may shed new light on
studying the quantum effect of time and general relativity.

the machine learning loss function by the optimality condition of the
downstream optimization. The max-margin formulation enjoys both computational
efficiency and good theoretical properties for the learning procedure. More
importantly, our new approach only needs the observations of the optimal
solution in the training data rather than the objective function, which makes
it a new and natural approach to the inverse linear programming problem under
both contextual and context-free settings; we also analyze the proposed method

technique used to evaluate the strength of long-range correlations in empirical
time series in terms of the Hurst exponent, $H$. Specifically, DFA quantifies
the linear regression slope in log-log coordinates representing the
relationship between the time series' variability and the number of timescales
over which this variability is computed. We compared the performance of two
methods of fractal analysis -- the current gold standard, DFA, and a Bayesian
method that is not currently well-known in behavioral sciences: the
Hurst-Kolmogorov (HK) method -- in estimating the Hurst exponent of synthetic
and empirical time series. Simulations demonstrate that the HK method
consistently outperforms DFA in three important ways. The HK method: (i)
accurately assesses long-range correlations when the measurement time series is
short, (ii) shows minimal dispersion about the central tendency, and (iii)
yields a point estimate that does not depend on the length of the measurement
time series or its underlying Hurst exponent. Comparing the two methods using
empirical time series from multiple settings further supports these findings.
We conclude that applying DFA to synthetic time series and empirical time
series during brief trials is unreliable and encourage the systematic
application of the HK method to assess the Hurst exponent of empirical time
series in behavioral sciences.

in our sample is the $z=1.42$ galaxy CSWA-141, one of the brightest known
reionization-era analogs at high redshift (g=20.5), with a large sSFR (31.2
Gyr$^{-1}$) and an [OIII]+H$\beta$ equivalent width
(EW$_{\rm{[OIII]+H\beta}}$=730~\r{A}) that is nearly identical to the average
value expected at $z\simeq 7-8$. In this paper, we investigate the rest-frame
UV nebular line emission in our sample with the goal of understanding the
factors that regulate strong CIII] emission. Whereas most of the sources in our
sample show weak UV line emission, we find elevated CIII] in the spectrum of
CSWA-141 (EW$_{\rm{CIII]}}$=4.6$\pm1.9$~\r{A}) together with detections of
other prominent emission lines (OIII], Si III], Fe II$^\star$, Mg II). We
compare the rest-optical line properties of high redshift galaxies with strong
and weak CIII] emission, and find that systems with the strongest UV line
emission tend to have young stellar populations and nebular gas that is
moderately metal-poor and highly ionized, consistent with trends seen at low
and high redshift. The brightness of CSWA-141 enables detailed investigation of
the extreme emission line galaxies which become common at $z>6$. We find that
gas traced by the CIII] doublet likely probes higher densities than that traced
by [OII] and [SII]. Characterisation of the spectrally resolved Mg II emission
line and several low ionization absorption lines suggests neutral gas around
the young stars is likely optically thin, potentially facilitating the escape
of ionizing radiation.

stochastic-constrained online convex optimization under two-point bandit

which are constructed using Gaussian process regression models of these fields
trained on the parameters' measurements. We then assimilate measurements of the

optimization problem, we efficiently compute the Jacobian of the vector
objective by exploiting the sparsity structure of the linear system of
equations associated with the forward solution of the physics problem. The
CKLEMAP method provides better scalability compared to the standard MAP method.
In the MAP method, the number of unknowns to be estimated is equal to the
number of elements in the numerical forward model. On the other hand, in
CKLEMAP, the number of unknowns (CKLE coefficients) is controlled by the
smoothness of the parameter field and the number of measurements, and is in
general much smaller than the number of discretization nodes, which leads to a
significant reduction of computational cost with respect to the standard MAP
method. To show its advantage in scalability, we apply CKLEMAP to estimate the
transmissivity field in a two-dimensional steady-state subsurface flow model of
the Hanford Site by assimilating synthetic measurements of transmissivity and
hydraulic head. We find that the execution time of CKLEMAP scales nearly
linearly as $N^{1.33}$, where $N$ is the number of discretization nodes, while
the execution time of standard MAP scales as $N^{2.91}$. The CKLEMAP method
improved execution time without sacrificing accuracy when compared to the

to mitigating non-common path errors, recent focal plane wavefront sensing
techniques have been developed to operate at speeds fast enough to enable

These minimal hardware requirements enable the temporal amplitude modulation to
resolve the sine ambiguity of even wavefront modes for both low, mid, and high

classical phase diversity by defocusing the detector, but such techniques are
incompatible with simultaneous science observations. This optical chopping

provided that the correlation is extremal and has a full-rank model in the
class. This last condition automatically holds for the class of POVM quantum

self-test for projective models which is not a self-test for POVM models

  An advantage of our new definition is that it extends naturally to commuting

extracts knowledge from the parameters of an LM. Recently, it has been shown
that finetuning LMs on a set of factual knowledge makes them produce better
answers to queries from a different set, thus making finetuned LMs a good
candidate for knowledge extraction and, consequently, knowledge graph
construction. In this paper, we analyze finetuned LMs for factual knowledge
extraction. We show that along with its previously known positive effects,
finetuning also leads to a (potentially harmful) phenomenon which we call
Frequency Shock, where at the test time the model over-predicts rare entities
that appear in the training set and under-predicts common entities that do not
appear in the training set enough times. We show that Frequency Shock leads to
a degradation in the predictions of the model and beyond a point, the harm from
Frequency Shock can even outweigh the positive effects of finetuning, making
finetuning harmful overall. We then consider two solutions to remedy the
identified negative effect: 1- model mixing and 2- mixture finetuning with the
LM's pre-training task. The two solutions combined lead to significant
improvements compared to vanilla finetuning.

the inclusion of MAR; 2) the additional MAR causes the ion target flux to
roll-over during detachment; 3) the total $D\alpha$ emission in the divertor
increases during deep detachment by roughly a factor four; 4) the neutral atom
density in the divertor is doubled due to MAD, leading to a 50\% increase in
neutral pressure; 5) total hydrogenic power loss is increased by up to 60\% due
to MAD. These differences result in an improved agreement between the
experiment and the simulations in terms of spectroscopic measurements, ion
source/sink inferences and the occurrence of an ion target flux roll-over.

radiation near the local plasma frequency (fundamental emission) and double the
plasma frequency (harmonic). While the theoretical ratio of these two
frequencies is close to 2, simultaneous observations give ratios ranging from
1.6 to 2, suggesting either a ratio different from 2, a delay of the
fundamental emission, or both. To address this long-standing question, we
conducted high frequency, high time resolution imaging spectroscopy of type III
and type J bursts with fine structures for both the fundamental and harmonic
components with LOFAR between 30 and 80 MHz. The short-lived and narrow
frequency-band fine structures observed simultaneously at fundamental and
harmonic frequencies give a frequency ratio of 1.66 and 1.73, similar to
previous observations. However, frequency-time cross-correlations suggest a
frequency ratio of 1.99 and 1.95 with a time delay between the F and H
emissions of 1.00 and 1.67 s, respectively for each event. Hence, simultaneous
frequency ratio measurements different from 2 are caused by the delay of the
fundamental emission. Among the processes causing fundamental emission delays,
anisotropic radio-wave scattering is dominant. Moreover, the levels of
anisotropy and density fluctuations reproducing the delay of fundamental
emissions are consistent with those required to simulate the source size and
duration of fundamental emissions. Using these simulations we are able to, for
the first time, provide quantitative estimates of the delay time of the
fundamental emissions caused by radio-wave propagation effects at multiple
frequencies, which can be used in future studies.

specific gradient properties across different samples impact the convergence

analysis, we propose a new zero-shot proxy, ZiCo, the first proxy that works
consistently better than #Params. We demonstrate that ZiCo works better than

demonstrate that the optimal architectures found via ZiCo are as competitive as
the ones found by one-shot and multi-shot NAS methods, but with much less

reflected by exoplanets with atmospheres in evolutionary states from current
Earth to current Venus, with cloud compositions ranging from pure water to 0.75

polarisation of the reflected light shows larger variations with the planetary
phase angle than the total flux. Across the visible, the largest polarisation
is reached for an Earth-like atmosphere with water clouds, due to Rayleigh
scattering above the clouds and the rainbow near 40 deg phase angle. In the
near-infrared, the planet with a Venus-like CO2 atmosphere and thin water
clouds shows the most prominent polarisation features due to scattering by the
small cloud droplets. A planet around Alpha Centauri A would leave temporal
variations on the order of 10E-13 W/m3 in the reflected flux and 10E-11 in the
degree of polarisation along the planet's orbit for a spatially unresolved
star-planet system. Star-planet contrasts are on the order of 10E-10. Current
polarimeters cannot distinguish between the possible evolutionary phases of
spatially unresolved terrestrial exoplanets, as a sensitivity near 10E-10 is

starlight. Telescopes capable of reaching planet-star contrasts lower than

reinforcement learning, but counteracting off-policy bias without exacerbating
variance is challenging. Classically, off-policy bias is corrected in a
per-decision manner: past temporal-difference errors are re-weighted by the
instantaneous Importance Sampling (IS) ratio after each action via eligibility
traces. Many off-policy algorithms rely on this mechanism, along with differing
protocols for cutting the IS ratios to combat the variance of the IS estimator.
Unfortunately, once a trace has been fully cut, the effect cannot be reversed.
This has led to the development of credit-assignment strategies that account
for multiple past experiences at a time. These trajectory-aware methods have
not been extensively analyzed, and their theoretical justification remains
uncertain. In this paper, we propose a multistep operator that can express both
per-decision and trajectory-aware methods. We prove convergence conditions for
our operator in the tabular setting, establishing the first guarantees for
several existing methods as well as many new ones. Finally, we introduce
Recency-Bounded Importance Sampling (RBIS), which leverages trajectory

method of improving performance over a single model. Traditionally, ensembling
algorithms train their base learners independently or sequentially with the
goal of optimizing their joint performance. In the case of deep ensembles of
neural networks, we are provided with the opportunity to directly optimize the
true objective: the joint performance of the ensemble as a whole. Surprisingly,
however, directly minimizing the loss of the ensemble appears to rarely be
applied in practice. Instead, most previous research trains individual models
independently with ensembling performed post hoc. In this work, we show that
this is for good reason - joint optimization of ensemble loss results in
degenerate behavior. We approach this problem by decomposing the ensemble
objective into the strength of the base learners and the diversity between
them. We discover that joint optimization results in a phenomenon in which base
learners collude to artificially inflate their apparent diversity. This
pseudo-diversity fails to generalize beyond the training data, causing a larger
generalization gap. We proceed to demonstrate the practical implications of
this effect finding that, in some cases, a balance between independent training
and joint optimization can improve performance over the former while avoiding
the degeneracies of the latter.

a time-consuming optimization for every new image pair. Deep-learning (DL)

Evaluating the functions is fast, but capturing large transforms can be
challenging, and networks tend to struggle if a test-image characteristic
shifts from the training domain, such as the contrast or resolution. A majority
of affine methods are also agnostic to the anatomy the user wishes to align;
the registration will be inaccurate if algorithms consider all structures in
the image. We address these shortcomings with a fast, robust, and easy-to-use
DL tool for affine and deformable registration of any brain image without
preprocessing, right off the MRI scanner. First, we rigorously analyze how
competing architectures learn affine transforms across a diverse set of
neuroimaging data, aiming to truly capture the behavior of methods in the real
world. Second, we leverage a recent strategy to train networks with wildly
varying images synthesized from label maps, yielding robust performance across
acquisition specifics. Third, we optimize the spatial overlap of select
anatomical labels, which enables networks to distinguish between anatomy of
interest and irrelevant structures, removing the need for preprocessing that
excludes content that would otherwise reduce the accuracy of anatomy-specific
registration. We combine the affine model with prior work on deformable
registration and test brain-specific registration across a landscape of MRI
protocols unseen at training, demonstrating consistent and improved accuracy

as a powerful consistency test of our cosmological model. We show that through
combining CMB measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and the moving

independently from the large scale cosmic velocity field. This approach can
provide stringent constraints on the largest scale modes and can be achieved by
a simple change in the standard estimators. Alternatively if one assumes there

propagation modes and polarizations of elastic waves propagating in periodic
solid structures and metamaterials. The method uses the eigenvectors calculated
at each propagating wave solution eigenfrequency to identify the contribution
of each translational and rotational component of the total mass in motion. We
use this information to identify the dominant wave propagation mode by defining
a relative effective modal mass vector. Further, we associate each wave
solution with its correct polarization by defining a new polarization factor
that quantifies the relative orientation between the wave propagation and
lattice motion directions and provides a positive numerical value between 0
(pure S-wave) and 1 (pure P-wave). Further, we suggest a graphical
representational scheme for an easier visualization of the wave polarization
within traditional dispersion plots. The method is validated by comparing our
predictions against previously published results for various elastodynamic
problems. Finally, we use the proposed method to analyze the effect of various
lattice and structural parameter perturbations on the elastic wave propagation
and bandgap behavior of a square planar beam lattice and show the emergence of
previously unobserved dynamic characteristics, including various polarized
bandgaps, fluid-like behavior, and ultralow-frequency SH- and SV-bandgaps that
extend to 0 Hz. The proposed method provides an alternative computational
approach to the typically employed visual mode inspection technique and
provides a robust technique for analyzing the elastic wave response of periodic

transportation, using multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). First, the
dynamical model of the coupled system is obtained using the Newton-Euler
formalism, for ""n"" UAVs transporting a load, where the cables are supposed to
be rigid and mass-less. The control problem is stated as a trajectory tracking
directly on the load. To do so, a hierarchical control scheme is proposed based
on the attractive ellipsoid method, where a virtual controller is calculated
for tracking the position of the load, with this, the desired position for each
vehicle along with their desired cable tensions are estimated, and used to
compute the virtual controller for the position of each vehicle. This results
in an underdetermined system, where an infinite number of drones'
configurations comply with the desired load position, thus additional
constrains can be imposed to obtain an unique solution. Furthermore, this
information is used to compute the attitude reference for the vehicles, which
are feed to a quaternion based attitude control. The stability analysis, using
an energy-like function, demonstrated the practical stability of the system, it
is that all the error signals are attracted and contained in an invariant set.
Hence, the proposed scheme assures that, given well posed initial conditions,
the closed-loop system guarantees the trajectory tracking of the desired
position on the load with bounded errors. The proposed control strategy was
evaluated in numerical simulations for three agents following a smooth desired
trajectory on the load, showing good performance.

than it has ever been before and kinetic models are essential tools for their
industrialization. Kinetic models affect the design, the optimization and the
control of catalytic processes, but they are not easy to obtain. Classical
paradigms, such as mechanistic modeling require substantial domain knowledge,
while data-driven and hybrid modeling lack interpretability. Consequently, a
different approach called automated knowledge discovery has recently gained
popularity. Many methods under this paradigm have been developed, where ALAMO,
SINDy and genetic programming are notable examples. However, these methods
suffer from important drawbacks: they require assumptions about model
structures, scale poorly, lack robust and well-founded model selection
routines, and they are sensitive to noise. To overcome these challenges, the
present work constructs two methodological frameworks, Automated Discovery of
Kinetics using a Strong/Weak formulation of symbolic regression, ADoK-S and
ADoK-W, for the automated generation of catalytic kinetic models. We leverage
genetic programming for model generation, a sequential optimization routine for
model refinement, and a robust criterion for model selection. Both frameworks
are tested against three computational case studies of increasing complexity.
We showcase their ability to retrieve the underlying kinetic rate model with a
limited amount of noisy data from the catalytic system, indicating a strong
potential for chemical reaction engineering applications.

facilities, manufacturing, large-scale science experiments), where failures in
a sub-system can lead to low yield, faulty products, or even damage to
components. While complex systems often have a wealth of data, labeled
anomalies are typically rare (or even nonexistent) and expensive to acquire. In
this paper, we introduce a new method, called CoAD, for training anomaly
detection models on unlabeled data, based on the expectation that anomalous
behavior in one sub-system will produce coincident anomalies in downstream
sub-systems and products. Given data split into two streams $s$ and $q$ (i.e.,
subsystem diagnostics and final product quality), we define an unsupervised
metric, $\hat{F}_\beta$, out of analogy to the supervised classification
$F_\beta$ statistic, which quantifies the performance of the independent
anomaly detection algorithms on s and q based on their coincidence rate. We
demonstrate our method in four cases: a synthetic time-series data set, a
synthetic imaging data set generated from MNIST, a metal milling data set, and
a data set taken from a particle accelerator.

effect impacting the radial-velocities of a binary star system. Its presence
can notably hide the presence of orbiting circumbinary planets because many
fitting algorithms assume perfectly Keplerian motion. To first order, apsidal
precession ($\dot{\omega}$) can be accounted for by adding a linear term to the
usual Keplerian model. We include apsidal precession in the kima package, an
orbital fitter designed to detect and characterise planets from radial velocity
data. In this paper, we detail this and other additions to kima that improve
fitting for stellar binaries and circumbinary planets including corrections
from general relativity. We then demonstrate that fitting for $\dot{\omega}$
can improve the detection sensitivity to circumbinary exoplanets by up to an
order of magnitude in some circumstances, particularly in the case of
multi-planetary systems. In addition, we apply the algorithm to several real
systems, producing a new measurement of aspidal precession in KOI-126 (a tight
triple system), and a detection of $\dot{\omega}$ in the Kepler-16 circumbinary
system. Although apsidal precession is detected for Kepler-16, it does not have
a large effect on the detection limit or the planetary parameters. We also
derive an expression for the precession an outer planet would induce on the
inner binary and compare the value this predicts with the one we detect.

(LQR) for stabilizing falling liquid films via blowing and suction at the base.
LQR methods enable rapidly responding feedback control by precomputing a gain
matrix, but are only suitable for systems of linear ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). By contrast, the Navier-Stokes equations that describe the
dynamics of a thin liquid film flowing down an inclined plane are too complex
to stabilize with standard control-theoretical techniques. To bridge this gap
we use reduced-order models - the Benney equation and a weighted-residual
integral boundary layer model - obtained via asymptotic analysis to derive a
multi-level control framework. This framework consists of an LQR feedback
control designed for a linearised and discretised system of ODEs approximating
the reduced-order system, which are then applied to the full Navier-Stokes
system. The control scheme is tested via direct numerical simulation (DNS), and
compared to analytical predictions of linear stability thresholds and minimum
required actuator numbers. Comparing the strategy between the two reduced-order
models we show that in both cases we can successfully stabilize towards a
uniform flat film across their respective ranges of valid parameters, with the
more accurate weighted-residual model outperforming the Benney-derived
controls. The weighted-residual controls are also found to work successfully
far beyond their anticipated range of applicability. The proposed methodology
increases the feasibility of transferring robust control techniques towards
real-world systems, and is also generalisable to other forms of actuation.

of sight. While the scattering is well studied, the source variability
continues to push the limits of current imaging algorithms. In particular,
movie reconstructions are hindered by the sparse and time-variable coverage of
the array. In this paper, we study the impact of the planned Africa Millimetre
Telescope (AMT, in Namibia) and Canary Islands telescope (CNI) additions to the
time-dependent coverage and imaging fidelity of the EHT array. This African
array addition to the EHT further increases the eastwest (u, v) coverage and
provides a wider time window to perform high-fidelity movie reconstructions of
Sgr A*. We generated synthetic observations of Sgr A*'s accretion flow and used
dynamical imaging techniques to create movie reconstructions of the source. To
test the fidelity of our results, we used one general-relativistic
magneto-hydrodynamic model of the accretion flow and jet to represent the
quiescent state and one semi-analytic model of an orbiting hotspot to represent
the flaring state. We found that the addition of the AMT alone offers a
significant increase in the (u, v) coverage, leading to robust averaged images
during the first hours of the observating track. Moreover, we show that the
combination of two telescopes on the African continent, in Namibia and in the
Canary Islands, produces a very sensitive array to reconstruct the variability
of Sgr A* on horizon scales. We conclude that the African expansion to the EHT
increases the fidelity of high-resolution movie reconstructions of Sgr A* to

the dynamics about the two unstable Lagrange points at the ends of the bar will

candidate phrases using machine learning and identifies target relations with
hand-crafted rules. Results: The three systems achieved F1 scores of 0.884,
0.831, and 0.663 in the Subtask A of the Challenge, which are ranked third,
seventh, and eighth among the 15 participating teams. The review of the
extraction results from our systems reveals characteristics of each approach
and those of the SODH extraction task. Discussion: Phrases and relations
annotated in the task is unique and diverse, not conforming to the conventional
event extraction task. These annotations are difficult to model with limited
training data. The system that extracts information independently, ignoring the
annotated relations, achieves the highest F1 score. Meanwhile, LLM with its
versatile capability achieves the high F1 score, while respecting the annotated
relations. The rule-based system tackling relation extraction obtains the low
F1 score, while it is the most explainable approach. Conclusion: The F1 scores
of the three systems vary in this challenge setting, but each approach has
advantages and disadvantages in a practical application. The selection of the
approach depends not only on the F1 score but also on the requirements in the
application.

suited for practical DA scenarios of remote sensing image classification, since
these methods (such as unsupervised DA) rely on rich prior knowledge about the
relationship between label sets of source and target domains, and source data
are often not accessible due to privacy or confidentiality issues. To this end,
we propose a practical universal domain adaptation setting for remote sensing
image scene classification that requires no prior knowledge on the label sets.
Furthermore, a novel universal domain adaptation method without source data is
proposed for cases when the source data is unavailable. The architecture of the
model is divided into two parts: the source data generation stage and the model
adaptation stage. The first stage estimates the conditional distribution of
source data from the pre-trained model using the knowledge of
class-separability in the source domain and then synthesizes the source data.
With this synthetic source data in hand, it becomes a universal DA task to
classify a target sample correctly if it belongs to any category in the source
label set, or mark it as ``unknown"" otherwise. In the second stage, a novel
transferable weight that distinguishes the shared and private label sets in
each domain promotes the adaptation in the automatically discovered shared
label set and recognizes the ``unknown'' samples successfully. Empirical
results show that the proposed model is effective and practical for remote
sensing image scene classification, regardless of whether the source data is
available or not. The code is available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/UniDA.

rich foods is effective in preventing cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular

activity of lycopene is compromised by light, oxygen, and heat. A biodegradable
polymer such as PLA or PLGA is the most effective carrier for encapsulating
lycopene due to its excellent biodegradability, biocompatibility, and
nontoxigenic effect on the human metabolic system. Hence, the primary objective
of this study was to evaluate the effect of pasteurization on bioaccessibility
and control release kinetics of encapsulated lycopene nanoparticles in invitro
human GIT. In the first objective, sonication time, surfactant, and polymer
concentration were considered as the three factors to synthesize polymeric
lycopene nanoparticles (LNP) whereas in the second objective, type of
pasteurization, encapsulation, and juice concentration were three factors. In
Objectives 4 and 5, the type of encapsulation and pasteurization, and digestion
time were evaluated as the three factors used to evaluate the in-vitro
bioaccessibility of encapsulated lycopene NP. The study evidenced that
encapsulation improved the lycopene's bioaccessibility by 70% and more than 60%
for conventional pasteurized (CP) and microwave pasteurized (MP) nanoemulsions,
respectively without compromising the physicochemical properties of both PLA
and PLGA-lycopene nanoparticles. The invitro bioaccessibility study also showed
that CP reduced the functional activity of PLALNP by 20% whereas MP had no
significant effect on the bioaccessibility of PLA LNP. It is unlikely that the
PLGA LNP was more sensitive against MP nanoemulsion than the CP. In conclusion,
it was shown that the PLA LNP treated with MP provided the highest
bioaccessibility.

hybrid approach to approximate existing ice sheet computational models at a
fraction of their cost. Our approach consists of replacing the finite element
model for the momentum equations for the ice velocity, the most expensive part
of an ice sheet model, with a Deep Operator Network, while retaining a classic
finite element discretization for the evolution of the ice thickness. We show
that the resulting hybrid model is very accurate and it is an order of
magnitude faster than the traditional finite element model. Further, a
distinctive feature of the proposed model compared to other neural network
approaches, is that it can handle high-dimensional parameter spaces (parameter
fields) such as the basal friction at the bed of the glacier, and can therefore
be used for generating samples for uncertainty quantification. We study the
impact of hyper-parameters, number of unknowns and correlation length of the
parameter distribution on the training and accuracy of the Deep Operator

this data consider a specific conversion mechanism, such as the MSW
(Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein) effect, although flavor conversion is still an
open question in supernovae due to the presence of neutrino-neutrino
interactions. In our analysis, instead of considering a specific conversion
mechanism, we let the electron antineutrino survival probability
$P_{\overline{e}\overline{e}}$ be a free parameter. We fit the data from
Kamiokande-II, Baksan, and IMB detected spectrum with two classes of models:
time-integrated and time-dependent. For the time-integrated model, it is not
possible to put limits above $1\sigma$ (68% confidence level) on the survival
probability. The same happens for the time-dependent model when cooling is the
only mechanism of antineutrino emission. However, for models considering an
accretion phase, $P_{\overline{e}\overline{e}}\sim0$ is strongly rejected,
showing a preference for the existence of an accretion component in the
detected antineutrino flux, and a preference for normal mass ordering when only
the MSW is present.

an analysis of the learnt community distributions reveals overlap with known

populations', which have prompted a protracted search for their origin.
Properties requiring explanation include: the high fraction of polluted stars
($\sim 40{-}90$~percent, correlated with cluster mass), the absence of
pollution in young clusters and the lower pollution rate with binarity and
distance from the cluster centre. We present a novel mechanism for late
delivery of pollutants into stars via accretion of sub-stellar companions. In
this scenario, stars move through a medium polluted with AGB and massive star
ejecta, accreting material to produce companions with typical mass ratio $q\sim
0.1$. These companions undergo eccentricity excitation due to dynamical
perturbations by passing stars, culminating in a merger with their host star.
The accretion of the companion alters surface abundances via injected
pollutant. Alongside other self-enrichment models, the companion accretion
model can explain the dilution of pollutant and correlation with intra-cluster
location. The model also explains the ubiquity and discreteness of the
populations and correlations of enrichment rates with cluster mass, cluster age
and stellar binarity. Abundance variations in some clusters can be broadly
reproduced using AGB and massive binary ejecta abundances from the literature.
In other clusters, some high companion mass ratios ($q\gtrsim 1$) are required.
In these cases, the available mass budget necessitates a variable degree of
mixing of the polluted material with the primary star, deviations from model
ejecta abundances or mixing of internal burning products. We highlight the
avenues of further investigation which are required to explore some of the key
processes invoked in this model.

billion years of cosmic history is a major challenge for our understanding of
galaxy formation physics. The advent of JWST has exacerbated this issue by
confirming the existence of galaxies in significant numbers as early as the
first few hundred million years. Perhaps even more surprisingly, in some
galaxies, this initial highly efficient star formation rapidly shuts down, or
quenches, giving rise to massive quiescent galaxies as little as 1.5 billion
years after the Big Bang. However, due to their faintness and red colour, it
has proven extremely challenging to learn about these extreme quiescent
galaxies, or to confirm whether any exist at earlier times. Here we report the
spectroscopic confirmation of a massive quiescent galaxy, GS-9209, at redshift
$z=4.658$, just 1.25 billion years after the Big Bang, using JWST NIRSpec. From
these data we infer a stellar mass of $M_* = 3.8\pm0.2\times10^{10}\ M_\odot$,
which formed over a $\simeq200$ Myr period before this galaxy quenched its star
formation activity at $z=6.5^{+0.2}_{-0.5}$, when the Universe was $\simeq800$
million years old. Based on the presence of broad H$\alpha$ in the spectrum and
a high narrow-line [NII]/H$\alpha$ ratio, we infer the presence of an accreting
supermassive black hole, with a mass of $M_\bullet = 5\pm1\times10^{8}\
M_\odot$. This large black hole mass relative to the stellar mass suggests that
active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback may have been responsible for quenching
this galaxy. GS-9209 is also extremely compact, with an effective radius,
$r_e=215\pm20$ parsecs. This galaxy is both a likely descendent of the
highest-redshift submillimetre galaxies and quasars, and a likely progenitor
for the dense, ancient cores of the most massive local galaxies.

the fact that light is highly aberrated when scattering by the tissue
sub-components. One of the promising approaches for overcoming such aberrations
is wavefront-shaping, where one modulates the incoming and/or the outgoing
wavefront in a way that will allow it to focus into one spot despite scattering
in the tissue. Wavefront modulations are specific to the tissue sample being
imaged and need to be estimated based on a non-invasive feedback from a camera
collecting back-scattered light. Such modulations have been successively
estimated using feedback from strong fluorescent beads which have been manually
added to a sample. However, in a real biomedical application, such feedback
should be provided by the fluorescent components of the tissue itself, whose
emission is orders of magnitude lower than the one provided by beads. When such
a low number of photons is spread over multiple sensor pixels, the image is
highly susceptible to noise, and the feedback signal required for previous
algorithms cannot be detected. In this work we suggest a wavefront shaping
approach that works with a confocal modulation of both illumination and imaging
arms. The advantage of this approach is that as part of the optimization,
aberrations are corrected in the optics, before the detector. Hence the low
photon budget can be directed into a single sensor spot and detected with high
SNR. We derive the optimization problem from mathematical principles and show
why it favors modulations that actually correct the aberrations and focus all
light into one spot. We successfully demonstrate wavefront-shaping correction
on EGFP neurons sliced out of a mouse brain, despite scattering through thick

deterministic forces acting on the system. In out-of-equilibrium setups, e.g.,
for motions under action of L\'evy noises, the existence of the stationary
state is not only determined by the potential but also by the noise. Potential
wells need to be steeper than parabolic in order to assure existence of
stationary states. The existence of stationary states, in sub-harmonic
potential wells, can be restored by stochastic resetting, which is the protocol
of starting over at random times. Herein we demonstrate that the combined
action of L\'evy noise and Poissonian stochastic resetting can result in the
phase transition between non-equilibrium stationary states of various
multimodality in the overdamped system in super-harmonic potentials. Fine-tuned
resetting rates can increase the modality of stationary states, while for high
resetting rates the multimodality is destroyed as the stochastic resetting
limits the spread of particles.

ensembles that are currently at the forefront of random matrix theory by way of
studying two classes of ensembles using two different types of recursive
schemes: Established theory on Selberg correlation integrals is used to derive
linear differential equations on the eigenvalue densities and resolvents of the
classical matrix ensembles, which lead to $1$-point recursions, understood to
be analogues of the Harer-Zagier recursion, for the expansion coefficients of
the associated $1$-point cumulants, while loop equation analysis is used to
recursively compute some leading order correlator expansion coefficients
pertaining to certain products of random matrices that have recently come into
interest due to their connections to Muttalib-Borodin ensembles and integrals
of Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber type. We also show how the aforementioned
differential equations can be used to characterise the large $N$ limiting
statistics of the classical matrix ensembles' eigenvalue densities in the
global and edge scaling regimes and moreover give a comprehensive review of how
the Isserlis-Wick theorem implies ribbon graph interpretations for mixed
moments and cumulants of some of the ensembles at hand. It is expected that
this thesis will serve as a valuable resource for readers wanting a
well-rounded introduction to classical matrix ensembles, matrix product
ensembles, $1$-point recursions, loop equations, Selberg correlation integrals,

degree-one vortex boundary condition on $\partial B^N\times (0,1)^n$ in

global minimizer which is given by the non-escaping radially symmetric vortex

  $\bullet$ if $\epsilon\in (0, \epsilon_N)$, then every global minimizer is an
escaping radially symmetric vortex sheet solution of the form $R \tilde
u_\epsilon$ where $\tilde{u}_{\epsilon}(x,z)=(\tilde{f}_{\epsilon}(|x|)

$\delta_\mathrm{c}$, which in general depends on the underlying gravity theory.
Up to now, the majority of analytic and numerical techniques calculate
$\delta_\mathrm{c}$ within the framework of general relativity. In this work,
using simple physical arguments we estimate semi-analytically the PBH formation
threshold within the framework of quantum gravity, working for concreteness
within loop quantum cosmology (LQC). In particular, for low mass PBHs formed
close to the quantum bounce, we find a reduction in the value of
$\delta_\mathrm{c}$ up to $50\%$ compared to the general relativistic regime
quantifying for the first time to the best of our knowledge how quantum effects
can influence PBH formation within a quantum gravity framework. Finally, by
varying the Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$ of loop quantum gravity (LQG) we
show its effect on the value of $\delta_\mathrm{c}$ while using the
observational/phenomenological signatures associated to ultra-light PBHs,
namely the ones affected by LQG effects, we propose the PBH portal as a novel

all clients are defined in a common subspace i.e. all clients store their data

restrictive as clients, having their own systems to collect and then store
data, may use heterogeneous data representations. We aim at filling this gap.
To this end, we propose a general framework coined FLIC that maps client's data
onto a common feature space via local embedding functions. The common feature
space is learnt in a federated manner using Wasserstein barycenters while the
local embedding functions are trained on each client via distribution
alignment. We integrate this distribution alignement mechanism into a federated

performances against FL benchmarks involving heterogeneous input features

non-line-of-sight attenuation present distinct challenges. To enable robust
network localization, we present Sparse Matrix Inference and Linear Embedding

varying system parameters, such as the flow rate, flow configuration size,

by isolation distance, $d_{\rm{iso}}$. Extending previous work that explored
this scenario to $z=10$, we follow evolution of a $(60\:{\rm{Mpc}})^3$ volume
to $z=0$. We focus on evolution of SMBH comoving number densities, halo
occupation fractions, angular clustering and 3D clustering, exploring a range
of $d_{\rm{iso}}$ constrained by observed local number densities of SMBHs. We
also compute synthetic projected observational fields, in particular a case
comparable to the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. We compare Pop III.1 seeding to a
simple halo mass threshold model, commonly adopted in cosmological simulations
of galaxy formation. Major predictions of the Pop III.1 model include that all
SMBHs form by $z\sim25$, after which their comoving number densities are
near-constant, with low merger rates. Occupation fractions evolve to
concentrate SMBHs in the most massive halos by $z=0$, but with rare cases in
halos down to $\sim10^8\:M_\odot$. The $d_{\rm{iso}}$ scale at epoch of

to alleviate the data sparsity and cold-start problems in traditional
recommender systems. One popular paradigm is to employ overlapping user
representations to establish domain connections, thereby improving
recommendation performance in all scenarios. Nevertheless, the general practice
of this approach is to train user embeddings in each domain separately and then
aggregate them in a plain manner, often ignoring potential cross-domain
similarities between users and items. Furthermore, considering that their
training objective is recommendation task-oriented without specific
regularizations, the optimized embeddings disregard the interest alignment
among user's views, and even violate the user's original interest distribution.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-domain recommendation
framework, namely COAST, to improve recommendation performance on dual domains
by perceiving the cross-domain similarity between entities and aligning user
interests. Specifically, we first construct a unified cross-domain
heterogeneous graph and redefine the message passing mechanism of graph
convolutional networks to capture high-order similarity of users and items
across domains. Targeted at user interest alignment, we develop deep insights
from two more fine-grained perspectives of user-user and user-item interest
invariance across domains by virtue of affluent unsupervised and semantic
signals. We conduct intensive experiments on multiple tasks, constructed from
two large recommendation data sets. Extensive results show COAST consistently
and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain recommendation
algorithms as well as classic single-domain recommendation methods.

undermines the maintenance of herd immunity and elevates the likelihood of
outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Our aim is to identify demographic

help public health professionals and medical providers develop interventions

in transporting tracers such as heat, nutrients, and carbon-dioxide within and
across ocean basins. Traditionally, the gyre circulation is thought to be
driven by surface winds and quantified via Sverdrup balance, but it has been
proposed that surface buoyancy fluxes may also contribute to gyre forcing.
Through a series of eddy-permitting global ocean model simulations with
perturbed surface forcing, the relative contribution of wind stress and surface
heat flux forcing to the large-scale ocean circulation is investigated,
focusing on the subtropical gyres. In addition to gyre strength being linearly
proportional to wind stress, it is shown that the gyre circulation is strongly
impacted by variations in the surface heat flux (specifically, its meridional
gradient) through a rearrangement of the ocean's buoyancy structure. On shorter
timescales ($\sim$ decade), the gyre circulation anomalies are proportional to
the magnitude of the surface heat flux gradient perturbation, with up to $\sim
0.15\,\mathrm{Sv}$ anomaly induced per $\mathrm{W}\,\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ change in
the surface heat flux. On timescales longer than a decade, the gyre response to
surface buoyancy flux gradient perturbations becomes non-linear as ocean
circulation anomalies feed back onto the buoyancy structure induced by the
surface buoyancy fluxes. These interactions complicate the development of a
buoyancy-driven theory for the gyres to complement the Sverdrup relation. The
flux-forced simulations underscore the importance of surface buoyancy forcing
in steering the large-scale ocean circulation.

Bose-Einstein correlations in a moat regime in heavy-ion collisions. The
resulting two-particle spectra exhibit peaks at nonzero average pair momentum,

skeleton as a complete graph, resulting in less variations between different
actions (e.g., the connection between the elbow and head in action ``clapping
hands''). For this, we propose a novel Contrastive GCN-Transformer Network
(ConGT) which fuses the spatial and temporal modules in a parallel way. The
ConGT involves two parallel streams: Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolution stream
(STG) and Spatial-Temporal Transformer stream (STT). The STG is designed to
obtain action representations maintaining the natural topology structure of the
human skeleton. The STT is devised to acquire action representations containing
the global relationships among joints. Since the action representations
produced from these two streams contain different characteristics, and each of
them knows little information of the other, we introduce the contrastive
learning paradigm to guide their output representations of the same sample to
be as close as possible in a self-supervised manner. Through the contrastive
learning, they can learn information from each other to enrich the action
features by maximizing the mutual information between the two types of action
representations. To further improve action recognition accuracy, we introduce
the Cyclical Focal Loss (CFL) which can focus on confident training samples in
early training epochs, with an increasing focus on hard samples during the
middle epochs. We conduct experiments on three benchmark datasets, which
demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in action

However, since most data only provide information integrated along the

outflows. In this paper, we present a method to directly measure the gas
electron density in outflows (ne), which in turn yields estimates of outflow
cloud properties (e.g., density, volume filling-factor, and sizes/masses). We
also estimate the distance (r) from the starburst at which the observed
densities are found. We focus on 22 local star-forming galaxies primarily from
the COS Legacy Archive Spectroscopic SurveY (CLASSY). In half of them, we
detect absorption lines from fine structure excited transitions of Si II (i.e.,
Si II*). We determine ne from relative column densities of Si II and Si II*,
given Si II* originates from collisional excitation by free electrons. We find
that the derived ne correlates well with the galaxy's star-formation rate per
unit area. From photoionization models or assuming the outflow is in pressure
equilibrium with the wind fluid, we get r ~ 1 to 2 * rstar or ~ 5 * rstar,
respectively, where rstar is the starburst radius. Based on comparisons to
theoretical models of multi-phase outflows, nearly all of the outflows have
cloud sizes large enough for the clouds to survive their interaction with the
hot wind fluid. Most of these measurements are the first-ever for galactic
winds detected in absorption lines and, thus, will provide important
constraints for future models of galactic winds.

to the classical problem: (1) it considers the dynamic nature of the problem,
where the demand is uncertain and changes over time, and (2) it allows for the
modification of the facility locations over time, subject to a fixed number of
modifications. The proposed model is using robust optimization in order to
address the uncertainty of demand by allowing for the optimization of solutions
that are not overly sensitive to small changes in the data or parameters. To
manage the computational challenges presented by large-scale DMS-p-MP networks,
a Lagrangian relaxation (LR) algorithm is employed. Our computational study in

formulation in solving the DMS p-Median Problem. According to the results, the
number of opened and closed buildings remains unchanged as the time horizon
increases. This is due to the periodic nature of our demand. This formulation

rigorous analysis of training dynamics is one of the most prominent unsolved

theory, and in particular Dudley theorem, we derive upper bounds on the
Rademacher complexity of NOs, and ${\textit{s}}{\text{NO}}+\varepsilon$. For
the latter, our bounds do not rely on norm control of parameters. This makes it
applicable to networks of any depth, as long as the random variables in the

generalization, as we have conjectured. In contrast, the bounds in NOs, solely
rely on norm control of the parameters, and exhibit an exponential dependence
on depth. Furthermore, our experiments also demonstrate that our proposed

uses a data-driven approach to find the optimal control sequences of all
building's subsystems, including HVAC, lighting, blind and window systems. The
DRL architecture includes a novel reward function that allows the framework to
explore the tradeoffs between energy use and users' comfort, while at the same

interactions of four different building subsystems. In order to cope with
OCTOPUS's data training requirements, we argue that calibrated simulations that
match the target building operational points are the vehicle to generate enough
data to be able to train our DRL framework to find the control solution for the
target building. In our work, we trained OCTOPUS with 10-year weather data and
a building model that is implemented in the EnergyPlus building simulator,

checkpointing (or snapshotting). This increases the reliability of the system,
makes it more immune to power failures, and reduces wasted work in especially
an HPC setup. The traditional line of thinking is to design a system that is
conceptually similar to transactional memory, where we log updates all the
time, and minimize the wasted work or alternatively the MTTR (mean time to
recovery). Such ``instant recovery'' systems allow the system to recover from a
point that is quite close to the point of failure. The penalty that we pay is
the prohibitive number of additional writes to the NVM.
  We propose a paradigmatically different approach in this paper, where we
argue that in most practical settings such as regular HPC workloads or neural
network training, there is no need for such instant recovery. This means that
we can afford to lose some work, take periodic software-initiated checkpoints
and still meet the goals of the application. The key benefit of our scheme is
that we reduce write amplification substantially; this extends the life of NVMs

augmentation methods, mixing-based approaches are effective and practical.
However, previous mixing-based data augmentation methods do not thoroughly
explore the essential characteristics of pathology images, including the local
specificity, global distribution, and inner/outer-sample instance relationship.
To further understand the pathology characteristics and make up effective
pseudo samples, we propose the CellMix framework with a novel
distribution-based in-place shuffle strategy. We split the images into patches
with respect to the granularity of pathology instances and do the shuffle
process across the same batch. In this way, we generate new samples while
keeping the absolute relationship of pathology instances intact. Furthermore,
to deal with the perturbations and distribution-based noise, we devise a
loss-drive strategy inspired by curriculum learning during the training
process, making the model fit the augmented data adaptively. It is worth
mentioning that we are the first to explore data augmentation techniques in the
pathology image field. Experiments show SOTA results on 7 different datasets.
We conclude that this novel instance relationship-based strategy can shed light
on general data augmentation for pathology image analysis. The code is

broadcast channel (BC), regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding has attracted
much attention. However, the reliability performance, i.e., secrecy outage
probability (SOP), of RZF is not well investigated in the literature. In this
paper, we characterize the secrecy performance of RZF precoding in the large
multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast system. For this purpose, we
first consider a central limit theorem (CLT) for the joint distribution of the
users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and the eavesdropper's
(Eve's) signal-to-noise ratio (ESNR) by leveraging random matrix theory (RMT).
The result is then utilized to obtain a closed-form approximation for the
ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and SOP of three typical scenarios: the case with
only external Eves, the case with only internal Eves, and that with both. The
derived results are then used to evaluate the percentage of users in secrecy
outage and the required number of transmit antennas to achieve a positive
secrecy rate. It is shown that, with equally-capable Eves, the secrecy loss
caused by external Eves is higher than that caused by internal Eves. Numerical
simulations validate the accuracy of the theoretical results.

leveraged different amounts of embodiment and visual perception ranging from a
2D visualization desktop environment with a standard mouse to a 3D
visualization virtual reality environment. We measured the accuracy, speed,
perceived workload, and preferences of 20 participants as they completed three
network analytic tasks, each of which required unique navigation and
substantial effort. For the task that required participants to iterate over the
entire visualization rather than focus on a specific area, we found that
participants were more accurate using a VR and a trackball mouse than
conventional desktop settings. From a workload perspective, VR was generally
considered the least mentally demanding and least frustrating in two of our
three tasks. It was also preferred and ranked as the most effective and
visually appealing condition overall. However, using VR to compare two
side-by-side networks was difficult, and it was similar to or slower than other
conditions in two of the three tasks. Overall, the accuracy and workload
advantages of conditions with greater embodiment in specific tasks suggest
promising opportunities to create more effective environments in which to

spectral information that should be properly considered. However, existing
methods show limitations in exploring the spectral correlations across
different bands and feature interactions within each band. Besides, the low-
and high-level features usually exhibit different importance for different
spatial-spectral regions, which is not fully explored for current algorithms as
well. In this paper, we present a Mixed Attention Network (MAN) that
simultaneously considers the inter- and intra-spectral correlations as well as
the interactions between low- and high-level spatial-spectral meaningful

that efficiently integrates the inter-spectral features across all the spectral
bands. These features are further enhanced with a progressive spectral channel
attention by exploring the intra-spectral relationships. Moreover, we propose
an attentive skip-connection that adaptively controls the proportion of the
low- and high-level spatial-spectral features from the encoder and decoder to
better enhance the aggregated features. Extensive experiments show that our MAN
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on simulated and real noise

inspired by a recent result of Aharonov, Gao, Landau, Liu and Vazirani and
makes use of an observation originally due to Kalai and Kindler that the output
probability of Boson Sampling experiments with a Gaussian noise model can be
approximated by sparse low-degree polynomials. This observation alone does not
suffice for classical sampling, because its marginal probabilities might not be
approximated by sparse low-degree polynomials, and furthermore, the
approximated probabilities might be negative. We solve this problem by
employing the first quantization representation to give an algorithm for
computing the marginal probabilities of these experiments. We prove that when
the overall noise rate is constant, the algorithm runs in time quasi-polynomial
in the number of input photons $N$ and accuracy. When the overall noise rate
scales as $1-x_1^\gamma$ for constant $x_1$ and $\gamma=\Omega(\log N)$, the
running time becomes polynomial. Furthermore, we study noisy Boson Sampling
with practically relevant noise models such as partial distinguishability and

noisy quantum advantage for these noise models in certain parameter regimes.

framework, named FairFor, for fairness-aware MTS forecasting. FairFor is based
on adversarial learning to generate both group-irrelevant and -relevant
representations for the downstream forecasting. FairFor first adopts the
recurrent graph convolution to capture spatio-temporal variable correlations
and to group variables by leveraging a spectral relaxation of the K-means
objective. Then, it utilizes a novel filtering & fusion module to filter the
group-relevant information and generate group-irrelevant representations by
orthogonality regularization. The group-irrelevant and -relevant
representations form highly informative representations, facilitating to share
the knowledge from advantaged variables to disadvantaged variables and
guarantee fairness. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate

maximizing the loss function with some box-constraints. However, for solving
this induced optimization problem, the state-of-the-art gradient-based methods
such as FGSM, I-FGSM and MI-FGSM look different from their original methods
especially in updating the direction, which makes it difficult to understand
them and then leaves some theoretical issues to be addressed in viewpoint of
optimization. In this paper, from the perspective of adapting step-size, we
provide a unified theoretical interpretation of these gradient-based
adversarial learning methods. We show that each of these algorithms is in fact
a specific reformulation of their original gradient methods but using the
step-size rules with only current gradient information. Motivated by such
analysis, we present a broad class of adaptive gradient-based algorithms based
on the regular gradient methods, in which the step-size strategy utilizing
information of the accumulated gradients is integrated. Such adaptive step-size
strategies directly normalize the scale of the gradients rather than use some
empirical operations. The important benefit is that convergence for the
iterative algorithms is guaranteed and then the whole optimization process can
be stabilized. The experiments demonstrate that our AdaI-FGM consistently
outperforms I-FGSM and AdaMI-FGM remains competitive with MI-FGSM for black-box

and extremes in building cooling demand, estimated from cooling degree hours
(CDH) using meteorological data from 1990 to 2021, largely explained by global
warming, urban heat islands, and extreme heat events. The quantification of the
impact of base temperatures further reveals that 20% energy saving could be
achieved by increasing one degree setpoint temperatures, which could be
potentially reached by regulatory intervention on building system operation.

process of damage nucleation, growth and localisation. This process spans
multiple length scales and is challenging to simulate numerically due to its
high computational cost. One option is to use domain decomposed multi-scale
methods with dynamical refinement. If needed, these methods refine coarse
regions into a fine-scale representation to explicitly model the damage in the
microstructure. However, damage evolution is commonly restricted to fine-scale
regions only. Thus, they are unable to capture the full complexity and breath
of the degradation process in the material. In this contribution, a generic
procedure that allows to account for damage in all representations is proposed.
The approach combines a specially designed orthotropic damage law, with a
scheme to generate pre-damaged fine-scale microstructures. Results indicate
that the damage approximation for the coarse representation works well.
Furthermore, the generated fine-scale damage patterns are overall consistent
with explicitly simulated damage patterns. Minor discrepancies occur in the
generation but subsequently vanish when explicit damage evolution continuous;
for instance under increased load. The presented approach provides a
methodological basis for adaptive multi-scale simulation schemes with
consistent damage evolution.

explore and map an unknown environment as fast as possible. Since the
environment is being revealed during exploration, the robot needs to frequently
re-plan its path online, as new information is acquired by onboard sensors and
used to update its partial map. While state-of-the-art exploration planners are
frontier- and sampling-based, encouraged by the recent development in deep
reinforcement learning (DRL), we propose ARiADNE, an attention-based neural
approach to obtain real-time, non-myopic path planning for autonomous
exploration. ARiADNE is able to learn dependencies at multiple spatial scales
between areas of the agent's partial map, and implicitly predict potential
gains associated with exploring those areas. This allows the agent to sequence
movement actions that balance the natural trade-off between
exploitation/refinement of the map in known areas and exploration of new areas.
We experimentally demonstrate that our method outperforms both learning and
non-learning state-of-the-art baselines in terms of average trajectory length
to complete exploration in hundreds of simplified 2D indoor scenarios. We
further validate our approach in high-fidelity Robot Operating System (ROS)
simulations, where we consider a real sensor model and a realistic low-level

propose two methods that reduce forgetting on the remaining data: 1) utilizing

leveraging weight importance metrics to pinpoint network parameters guilty of

strength is collectively enhanced by the square root of the number of spins to
overcome the weaker coupling between individual spins and the microwave field.
However, achievement of strong magnon-magnon coupling in a confined nanomagnets

through intensive study of interaction between different magnon modes in a

approach the strong coupling regime with coupling strength up to 0.82 GHz and
cooperativity of 2.51. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that the intermodal

locating vulnerable code by obfuscating the third-party code, to achieve the
purpose of protecting embedded device software. With the rapid development of
binary diffing techniques, they can achieve more and more accurate function
matching and identification by extracting the features within the function.
This makes existing software obfuscation techniques, which mainly focus on the
intra-procedural code obfuscation, no longer effective.
  In this paper, we propose a new inter-procedural code obfuscation mechanism
Khaos, which moves the code across functions to obfuscate the function by using
compilation optimizations. Two obfuscation primitives are proposed to separate
and aggregate the function, which are called fission and fusion respectively. A
prototype of Khaos is implemented based on the LLVM compiler and evaluated on a
large number of real-world programs including SPEC CPU 2006 & 2017, CoreUtils,

of the waveguide constitutive cell, assuming linearity and periodicity. MEMS
waveguides composed of coupled drumhead (membrane) resonators offer tunable MHz
operation frequencies for applications in nonlinear optomechanics, topological
insulators, phononic cavities, and acoustic switching. Here, we construct a
reduced-order model (ROM) to demonstrate the switching of signal transmission
in drumhead-resonator waveguides due to thermoelastic buckling. The ROM shows
that buckling amplifies existing structural disorders, breaking the periodicity
required for waveguide transmission through the first passband. This
periodicity breaking manifests in the localization of the first-passband modes,
like classical Anderson localization caused by disorders. The proposed ROM is
essential to study the investigated phenomena since Bloch mode analysis fails
for weakly-disordered (< 5%) finite waveguides due to the disorder
amplification caused by the thermoelastic buckling. The illustrated
transmission control should be useful for logical acoustic operations, like
switching, and can be extended to 2D circuits in the future.

(AUVs). To perform these tasks, AUVs must navigate the rough challenging sea
environment. AUVs usually employ an inertial navigation system (INS), aided by
a Doppler velocity log (DVL), to provide the required navigation accuracy. The
DVL transmits four acoustic beams to the seafloor, and by measuring changes in
the frequency of the returning beams, the DVL can estimate the AUV velocity
vector. However, in practical scenarios, not all the beams are successfully
reflected. When only three beams are available, the accuracy of the velocity
vector is degraded. When fewer than three beams are reflected, the DVL cannot
estimate the AUV velocity vector. This paper presents a data-driven approach,
MissBeamNet, to regress the missing beams in partial DVL beam measurement
cases. To that end, a deep neural network (DNN) model is designed to process
the available beams along with past DVL measurements to regress the missing
beams. The AUV velocity vector is estimated using the available measured and
regressed beams. To validate the proposed approach, sea experiments were made
with the ""Snapir"" AUV, resulting in an 11 hours dataset of DVL measurements.

varying syntax and vocabulary in clinical free text. Structured information
such as International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes often succinctly
abstracts the most important facts of a clinical encounter and yields good
performance, but is often not as available as clinical text in real-world

learns from codes and text to combine the availability and forward-looking
nature of text and better performance of ICD codes. The learned text embeddings
can be used as inputs to predictive algorithms independent of the ICD codes
during inference. Our approach uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to process ICD

each patient. In experiments using planned surgical procedure text, our model
outperforms BERT models fine-tuned to clinical data, and in experiments using
diverse text in MIMIC-III, our model is competitive to a fine-tuned BERT at a

charges on sub-second timescales while sticking to the electrodes according to
the field polarity. Charging at the electrodes results in a repulsive (lifting)
force and continues until repulsion overcomes adhesion and particles are
lifted, moving towards the opposite electrode. Some aggregates remain attached,
which is consistent with a maximum charge limit being reached, providing an
electrostatic force too small to counteract adhesion. All observations are in
agreement with a model of moderately conductive grains with a small but varying

planetary surfaces with atmospheres, electrostatic repulsion can significantly

Yang-Lee anyons are non-unitary counterparts of Fibonacci anyons. Another

be intriguing. When using more precise waveforms, extending the frequency range

interval being $7.94^{+0.70}_{-1.05}$. If one assumes that the signal comes
from a real gravitational-wave merger event, we find a light component $m_2 =

solar mass at $83.8\%$ confidence level. Such a low mass for a compact object

information theoretic measure of temporal networks, with the aim to detect the
timescales at which the causal influences occur in temporal networks. The
measure can be used on temporal networks as a whole, or separately for each

Furthermore, we notice in both synthetic and empirical data that the temporal
path entropy tends to decrease at timescales that correspond to the causal

measuring temporal path entropy. This is crucial for the analysis of temporal

of the Br{\gamma} line emitting region across the line profile. This spectral

  Results. We derive Br{\gamma} line profiles as a function of rotational phase
and compute interferometric observables, visibilities and phases, from
synthetic images. The line profile shape is modulated along the rotational
cycle, exhibiting inverse P Cygni profiles at the time the accretion shock
faces the observer. The size of the line's emission region decreases as the
magnetic obliquity increases, which is reflected in a lower line flux. We apply
interferometric models to the synthetic visibilities in order to derive the
size of the line-emitting region. We find the derived interferometric size to
be more compact than the actual size of the magnetosphere, ranging from 50 to
90\% of the truncation radius. Additionally, we show that the rotation of the
non-axisymmetric magnetosphere is recovered from the rotational modulation of
the Br{\gamma}-to-continuum photo-centre shifts, as measured by the
differential phase of interferometric visibilities.

high-resolution point clouds rises. As the capturing process is a complex task,
point cloud upsampling is often desired. We propose Frequency-Selective
Upsampling (FSU), an upsampling scheme that upsamples geometry and attribute
information of point clouds jointly in a sequential manner with overlapped
support areas. The point cloud is partitioned into blocks with overlapping
support area first. Then, a continuous frequency model is generated that
estimates the point cloud's surface locally. The model is sampled at new
positions for upsampling. In a subsequent step, another frequency model is
created that models the attribute signal. Here, knowledge from the geometry
upsampling is exploited for a simplified projection of the points in two
dimensions. The attribute model is evaluated for the upsampled geometry
positions. In our extensive evaluation, we evaluate geometry and attribute
upsampling independently and show joint results. The geometry results show best
performances for our proposed FSU in terms of point-to-plane error and
plane-to-plane angular similarity. Moreover, FSU outperforms other color
upsampling schemes by 1.9 dB in terms of color PSNR. In addition, the visual

view is the physical consistency of this model, which leads to proposing the
strong axiom, explaining that every particle rounding on a CTC will be

the same notion, particularly for Turing machines. We claim that in a universe
containing CTCs, the two axioms must be true; otherwise, there will be an
infinite number of any particle rounding on a CTC in the universe.
  An immediate result of the weak axiom is the incapability of Turing machines
to convey information for a full round on a CTC, leading to the proposed
$\text{TM}_\text{CTC}$ programs for the aforementioned corollaries failing to

operator of closure spaces and quasi-discrete closure spaces induces a notion
of neighborhood akin to that of topological spaces that build on open sets. For
closure models and quasi-discrete closure models, in this paper we present
three notions of bisimilarity that are logically characterised by corresponding
modal logics with spatial modalities: (i) CM-bisimilarity for closure models
(CMs) is shown to generalise Topo-bisimilarity for topological models.
CM-bisimilarity corresponds to equivalence with respect to the infinitary modal
logic IML that includes the modality ${\cal N}$ for ``being near''. (ii)
CMC-bisimilarity, with `CMC' standing for CM-bisimilarity with converse,
refines CM-bisimilarity for quasi-discrete closure spaces, carriers of
quasi-discrete closure models. Quasi-discrete closure models come equipped with
two closure operators, Direct ${\cal C}$ and Converse ${\cal C}$, stemming from
the binary relation underlying closure and its converse. CMC-bisimilarity, is
captured by the infinitary modal logic IMLC including two modalities, Direct
${\cal N}$ and Converse ${\cal N}$, corresponding to the two closure operators.
(iii) CoPa-bisimilarity on quasi-discrete closure models, which is weaker than
CMC-bisimilarity, is based on the notion of compatible paths. The logical
counterpart of CoPa-bisimilarity is the infinitary modal logic ICRL with
modalities Direct $\zeta$ and Converse $\zeta$, whose semantics relies on
forward and backward paths, respectively. It is shown that CoPa-bisimilarity
for quasi-discrete closure models relates to divergence-blind stuttering
equivalence for Kripke structures.

characteristics, quantum geometric tensor and Berry curvature play critical
roles in various Hall effects, so are their quantum fluctuations. It is found
that the thermal Hall noise in linear order of the electric field is purely
intrinsic, and the second-order thermal Hall noise has both intrinsic and

stability of the semi-discrete scheme for PDEs has not been reported yet. The
difficulty associated with the uniformity is that due to the parameter of the
step size, it involves a family of operators in different state spaces that
need to be considered simultaneously. Based on the Huang-Pr\""{u}ss frequency
domain criterion for uniform exponential stability of a family of
$C_0$-semigroups in Hilbert spaces, we solve this problem for the first time by
proving the uniform boundedness for all the resolvents of these operators on
the imaginary axis. The proof almost exactly follows the procedure for the
exponential stability of the continuous counterpart, highlighting
  the advantage of this discretization method.

is considered. The general result is that the value of the relative speed of
the objects following their non-zero angular momentum trajectories, both of
geodesic and non-geodesic character, when approaching the ultimate singularity,
tends to the value of speed of light. There is only one exception when both
objects move in the same plane and have parallel angular momenta. This outcome
appears to have a deeper sense: it reflects the anisotropic character of the
dynamics of interior of this particular black hole. The result in question
means that near the singularity, collisions of two particles lead to an
indefinitely large energy in the center of mass frame. Aforementioned
properties have their counterpart in the phenomenon of an indefinitely large
blueshift near the singularity. Thus the angular momentum of a particle turns
out an important feature that affects the final behavior of particle near the
singularity. Motivated by this fact, we generalize the Lema\^{\i}tre frame
under the horizon in such a way that reference particles themselves have
nonzero angular momentum. Our results apply not only to the Schwarzschild
singularity but also to other space-like ones for which the scale factor
$g\rightarrow \infty $. We also analyze another type of singulairites for which
the circumference radius vanishes but $g$ remains finite.

provide the maximal possible information. The shape of the energy depositions

parameter depending on a characteristic length of the discretized domain is
reduced, a corresponding numerical solution is calculated. A convergence to the

the field variance compared to purely quantum fluctuations, therefore
increasing the average energy density during thermal inflation and damping the

later formation of primordial black holes, at least on scales that leave the
horizon for $T>T_c$. The larger thermal field variance also reduces the
duration of a period of fast-roll inflation below $T_c$, as the field rolls to

exponents either calculated directly from eigenvalues of Jacobian of the $2$D

shapes, among which flip bifurcation and Neimark-Sacker bifurcation were

portrait and phase space diagram. Our model restored the $1$D logistic map of
the prey at the absence of the predator, as well as the normal competing
behavior between two species when the initial population of the two is equal.
In spite of the possibility for two species going into chaos simultaneously, it
is also possible that with the same inter-species parameters as normal but with
predator population $10$ times more than that of the prey, under certain growth
rate the latter becomes chaotic, and former dramatically reduces to zero,
referring to total annihilation of the predator species. Interpreting humans as
the predator and natural resources as the prey in the ecological system, the
aforementioned conclusion may imply that not only excessive consumption of the
natural resources, but its chaotic state triggered by overpopulation of humans
may also backfire in a manner of total extinction on human species.
Fortunately, a little chance may exist for survival of human race, as isolated
fixed points in bifurcation diagram of the predator reveals.

procedure constitutes an ill-posed inverse problem. For decades the CLEAN
algorithm was the standard choice in VLBI studies, although having some serious
disadvantages and pathologies that are challenged by the requirements of modern
frontline VLBI applications. We develop a novel multi-scale CLEAN deconvolution
method (DoB-CLEAN) based on continuous wavelet transforms that address several

reconstructions on synthetic data and reanalyze BL Lac observations of
RadioAstron with DoB-CLEAN. DoB-CLEAN approaches the image by multi-scalar and
multi-directional wavelet dictionaries. Two different dictionaries are used.
Firstly, a difference of elliptical spherical Bessel functions dictionary
fitted to the uv-coverage of the observation that is used to sparsely represent
the features in the dirty image. Secondly, a difference of elliptical Gaussian
wavelet dictionary that is well suited to represent relevant image features
cleanly. The deconvolution is performed by switching between the dictionaries.
DoB-CLEAN achieves super-resolution compared to CLEAN and remedies the spurious
regularization properties of CLEAN. In contrast to CLEAN, the representation by
basis functions has a physical meaning. Hence, the computed deconvolved image
still fits the observed visibilities, opposed to CLEAN. State-of-the-art
multi-scalar imaging approaches seem to outperform single-scalar standard

Neural networks have extensively been used before as approximators; in this
work, we make a step further and use them for the first time as abstractions.
For a given dynamical model, our method synthesises a neural network that
overapproximates its dynamics by ensuring an arbitrarily tight, formally
certified bound on the approximation error. For this purpose, we employ a
counterexample-guided inductive synthesis procedure. We show that this produces
a neural ODE with non-deterministic disturbances that constitutes a formal
abstraction of the concrete model under analysis. This guarantees a fundamental
property: if the abstract model is safe, i.e., free from any initialised
trajectory that reaches an undesirable state, then the concrete model is also
safe. By using neural ODEs with ReLU activation functions as abstractions, we
cast the safety verification problem for nonlinear dynamical models into that
of hybrid automata with affine dynamics, which we verify using SpaceEx. We
demonstrate that our approach performs comparably to the mature tool Flow* on
existing benchmark nonlinear models. We additionally demonstrate and that it is
effective on models that do not exhibit local Lipschitz continuity, which are

measurements of quantitative biomarkers are subject to random variability.
Hence, differences of a biomarker in longitudinal measurements do not
necessarily represent real change but might be caused by this random
measurement variability. Before utilizing a quantitative biomarker in
longitudinal studies, it is therefore essential to assess the measurement
repeatability. Measurement repeatability obtained from test-retest studies can
be quantified by the repeatability coefficient (RC), which is then used in the
subsequent longitudinal study to determine if a measured difference represents
real change or is within the range of expected random measurement variability.
The quality of the point estimate of RC therefore directly governs the
assessment quality of the longitudinal study. RC estimation accuracy depends on
the case number in the test-retest study, but despite its pivotal role, no
comprehensive framework for sample size calculation of test-retest studies

UX Ori type star RZ Psc in 2013, the accretion rate increased approximately by
an order of magnitude. This means that the accretion process at the late stages
of the Pre-Main Sequence evolution is very unstable. Using the spectra obtained
during this episode we have studied the magnetospheric emission in the
H$\alpha$ line. Models of magnetospheric accretion are calculated to obtain the
parameters of the magnetosphere from this observation. In present work we have
taken into account the influence of the recombination delay effect during gas
motion in the stellar magnetosphere. The accounting for this effect and the
presence of the magnetospheric absorption in the IR CaII triplet lines and its
absence in D Na I resonance lines allowed us to place a lower limit on the
temperature in the magnetosphere at $\approx$ 10000 K, which significantly
improved precision of our estimate of accretion rate. According to the best fit
model the logarithm of accretion rate is $\log\dot{M} = -10.1\pm0.3$ ($\dot{M}
\approx 7\times10^{-11}$ M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$) and the inclination angle of RZ
Psc is $43\pm 3^\circ$. It is less than the inclination, typical for the UX Ori
stars (about 70$^\circ$), that explains the weak photometric variability of
this star. Using the obtained accretion rate and magnetosphere radius we
estimate the strength of the dipole component of the magnetic field of RZ Psc
$\approx$ 0.1 kGs.

researchers and practitioners. In this paper, we propose a new graph-based
conditional moments (GRACE) method to do portfolio selection based on thousands
of stocks or more. The GRACE method first learns the conditional quantiles and
mean of stock returns via a factor-augmented temporal graph convolutional
network, which guides the learning procedure through a factor-hypergraph built
by the set of stock-to-stock relations from the domain knowledge as well as the
set of factor-to-stock relations from the asset pricing knowledge. Next, the
GRACE method learns the conditional variance, skewness, and kurtosis of stock
returns from the learned conditional quantiles by using the quantiled
conditional moment (QCM) method. The QCM method is a supervised learning
procedure to learn these conditional higher-order moments, so it largely
overcomes the computational difficulty from the classical high-dimensional
GARCH-type methods. Moreover, the QCM method allows the mis-specification in
modeling conditional quantiles to some extent, due to its regression-based
nature. Finally, the GRACE method uses the learned conditional mean, variance,
skewness, and kurtosis to construct several performance measures, which are
criteria to sort the stocks to proceed the portfolio selection in the
well-known 10-decile framework. An application to NASDAQ and NYSE stock markets
shows that the GRACE method performs much better than its competitors,
particularly when the performance measures are comprised of conditional
variance, skewness, and kurtosis.

general-purpose image restoration. The key construction consists in a
mean-reverting SDE that transforms a high-quality image into a degraded
counterpart as a mean state with fixed Gaussian noise. Then, by simulating the
corresponding reverse-time SDE, we are able to restore the origin of the
low-quality image without relying on any task-specific prior knowledge.
Crucially, the proposed mean-reverting SDE has a closed-form solution, allowing
us to compute the ground truth time-dependent score and learn it with a neural
network. Moreover, we propose a maximum likelihood objective to learn an
optimal reverse trajectory that stabilizes the training and improves the
restoration results. The experiments show that our proposed method achieves
highly competitive performance in quantitative comparisons on image deraining,
deblurring, and denoising, setting a new state-of-the-art on two deraining

in the chaotic attractor of the system. While equilibria, periodic orbits and
invariant tori can be constructed using existing methods, computations of
heteroclinic and homoclinic connections mediating the evolution between the
former invariant solutions remain challenging. We propose a robust matrix-free
variational method for computing connecting orbits between equilibrium
solutions of a dynamical system that can be applied to high-dimensional

problem in the space of smooth state space curves that connect the two
equilibria with a cost function measuring the deviation of a connecting curve
from an integral curve of the vector field. Minimization deforms a trial curve
until, at a global minimum, a connecting orbit is obtained. The method is
robust, has no limitation on the dimension of the unstable manifold at the
origin equilibrium, and does not suffer from exponential error amplification
associated with time-marching a chaotic system. Owing to adjoint-based
minimization techniques, no Jacobian matrices need to be constructed and the
memory requirement scales linearly with the size of the problem. The robustness

speech-to-text translation (ST). Different methods have been proposed to reduce
this gap, but most of them require architectural changes in ST training. In
this work, we propose to mitigate this issue at the pre-training stage,
requiring no change in the ST model. First, we show that the connectionist
temporal classification (CTC) loss can reduce the modality gap by design. We
provide a quantitative comparison with the more common cross-entropy loss,
showing that pre-training with CTC consistently achieves better final ST
accuracy. Nevertheless, CTC is only a partial solution and thus, in our second
contribution, we propose a novel pre-training method combining CTC and optimal
transport to further reduce this gap. Our method pre-trains a Siamese-like
model composed of two encoders, one for acoustic inputs and the other for
textual inputs, such that they produce representations that are close to each
other in the Wasserstein space. Extensive experiments on the standard CoVoST-2
and MuST-C datasets show that our pre-training method applied to the vanilla
encoder-decoder Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance under the
no-external-data setting, and performs on par with recent strong multi-task
learning systems trained with external data. Finally, our method can also be
applied on top of these multi-task systems, leading to further improvements for
these models. Code and pre-trained models are available at

the fidelity and duration of the intended quantum computation. However, current
quantum circuit adaptation techniques only apply a specific decomposition or
allow only for local improvements to the target quantum circuit potentially
resulting in a quantum computation with less fidelity or more qubit idle time
than necessary. These issues are further aggravated by the multiple options of
hardware-native quantum gates rendering multiple universal quantum gates sets

high-dimensional vectors containing the outputs of a detailed CFD steady-state

species mass fractions at each point in the discretization. A machine learning
workflow is presented, able to predict out-of-sample (a) observations (e.g.
mass fraction in the reactor) given process parameters (e.g. inlet

cause failures to capture important human-like behaviors. Here, we develop a
model of human pedestrian crossing decisions based on computational
rationality, an approach using deep reinforcement learning (RL) to learn
boundedly optimal behavior policies given human constraints, in our case a
model of the limited human visual system. We show that the proposed combined
cognitive-RL model captures human-like patterns of gap acceptance and crossing
initiation time. Interestingly, our model's decisions are sensitive to not only
the time gap, but also the speed of the approaching vehicle, something which
has been described as a ""bias"" in human gap acceptance behavior. However, our
results suggest that this is instead a rational adaption to human perceptual
limitations. Moreover, we demonstrate an approach to accounting for individual
differences in computational rationality models, by conditioning the RL policy
on the parameters of the human constraints. Our results demonstrate the
feasibility of generating more human-like road user behavior by combining RL
with cognitive models.

And considering the inherent graph structure of spatiotemporal data, recent
works focus on capturing spatial dependencies by utilizing Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCNs) to aggregate vertex features with the guidance of adjacency
matrices. In this paper, with extensive and deep-going experiments, we
comprehensively analyze existing spatiotemporal graph learning models and
reveal that extracting adjacency matrices with carefully design strategies,

largely ineffective. Meanwhile, based on these experiments, we also discover
that the aggregation itself is more important than the way that how vertices

(GFS) learning module based on layer normalization for capturing spatial
correlations in spatiotemporal graph learning. The proposed GFS module can be
easily plugged into existing models for replacing all graph convolution

GFS is significantly better than that of graph convolution operation. Extensive
experiments verify the superiority of GFS in both the perspectives of

address these issues, in this paper, we propose a multi-task multi-stage

elaborately design two auxiliary tasks, namely utterance discrimination and
speaker discrimination, to introduce the modelling of dialogue coherence and

three stages: 1) sentence-level pre-training on large-scale parallel corpus; 2)
intermediate training with auxiliary tasks using additional monolingual
dialogues; 3) context-aware fine-tuning with gradual transition. Particularly,
the second stage serves as an intermediate phase that alleviates the training
discrepancy between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Moreover, to make
the stage transition smoother, we train the NCT model using a gradual
transition strategy, i.e., gradually transiting from using monolingual to
bilingual dialogues. Extensive experiments on two language pairs demonstrate
the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed training framework.

the surfaces with $K_X$ nef and $c_2(X)=0 \in H^4(X, \mathbb{Z})$.
  We observe in the last section, using a construction by Chad Schoen, that a
similar picture does not hold in such a simple way in higher dimension.

considers the difficulties associated with document processing, including the
limited amount of training data available.
  In this respect, we propose a pixel-level detection model and a second
object-level detection model. We first propose a detection model with few
parameters, fast in prediction, and which can obtain accurate prediction masks
from a reduced number of training data. We implemented a strategy of collection
and uniformization of many datasets, which are used to train a single line
detection model that demonstrates high generalization capabilities to
out-of-sample documents.
  We also propose a Transformer-based detection model. The design of such a
model required redefining the task of object detection in document images and
to study different approaches. Following this study, we propose an object
detection strategy consisting in sequentially predicting the coordinates of the
objects enclosing rectangles through a pixel classification. This strategy
allows obtaining a fast model with only few parameters.
  Finally, in an industrial setting, new non-annotated data are often
available. Thus, in the case of a model adaptation to this new data, it is
expected to provide the system as few new annotated samples as possible. The
selection of relevant samples for manual annotation is therefore crucial to
enable successful adaptation. For this purpose, we propose confidence
estimators from different approaches for object detection. We show that these
estimators greatly reduce the amount of annotated data while optimizing the
performances.

$G$ such that $\text{deg}_F(x) \in \pi(v)$ for every $v$ of $G$. When all

To this end, we use the manipulation capabilities of a scanning tunneling

pedestal of two metal atoms. Measurements at millikelvin temperatures and
magnetic fields reveal that the bottom-up assembled standing metal-molecule

electrons, resulting in a Kondo temperature of only $291 \pm 13$ mK. We extract
the Land\'e $g$-factor of the molecule and the exchange coupling $J\rho$ to the

perturbation theory in the weak coupling and high-field regimes. Furthermore,
we show that the interaction between the STM tip and the molecule can tune the
exchange coupling to the substrate, which suggests that the bond between the

exploiting Enhanced Multivariance Products Representation to 3-D data. Features
were split as training and testing vectors. Training vectors were employed to

equal mass binaries with low eccentricity. We also simulate inclined test
particles and highly-misaligned circumstellar discs around one binary component
for comparison. During Kozai-Lidov (KL) cycles, the circumstellar disc
structure is altered through exchanges of disc eccentricity with disc tilt.
Highly inclined circumstellar discs and test particles around individual binary
components can experience very strong KL oscillations. The continuous accretion
of highly misaligned material from the circumbinary disc allows the KL
oscillations of circumstellar discs to be long-lived. In this process, the
circumbinary material is continuously delivered with a high inclination to the
lower inclination circumstellar discs. We find that the simulation resolution
is important for modeling the longevity of the KL oscillations. An initially
polar circumbinary disc forms nearly polar, circumstellar discs that undergo KL
cycles. The gas steams accreting onto the polar circumstellar discs vary in
tilt during each binary orbital period, which determines how much material is
accreted onto the discs. The long-lived KL cycles in polar circumstellar discs
may lead to the formation of polar S-type planets in binary star systems.

wide application of deep reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. Describing an
agent's desired behaviors and properties can be difficult, even for experts. A
new paradigm called reinforcement learning from human preferences (or
preference-based RL) has emerged as a promising solution, in which reward
functions are learned from human preference labels among behavior trajectories.
However, existing methods for preference-based RL are limited by the need for
accurate oracle preference labels. This paper addresses this limitation by
developing a method for crowd-sourcing preference labels and learning from
diverse human preferences. The key idea is to stabilize reward learning through
regularization and correction in a latent space. To ensure temporal
consistency, a strong constraint is imposed on the reward model that forces its
latent space to be close to the prior distribution. Additionally, a
confidence-based reward model ensembling method is designed to generate more
stable and reliable predictions. The proposed method is tested on a variety of
tasks in DMcontrol and Meta-world and has shown consistent and significant
improvements over existing preference-based RL algorithms when learning from

because it is natural for the modes on a fuzzball microstate to follow Poisson
statistics. In a previous paper, we noted a potential loophole here, thanks to
the modes depending not just on the $n$-quantum number, but also on the
$J$-quantum numbers of the compact dimensions. For a free scalar field $\phi$,
by imposing a Dirichlet boundary condition $\phi=0$ at the stretched horizon,
we showed that this $J$-dependence leads to a linear ramp in the Spectral Form
Factor (SFF). Despite this, the status of level repulsion remained mysterious.
In this letter, motivated by the profile functions of BPS fuzzballs, we
consider a generic profile $\phi = \phi_0(\theta)$ instead of $\phi=0$ at the
stretched horizon. For various notions of genericity (eg. when the Fourier
coefficients of $\phi_0(\theta)$ are suitably Gaussian distributed), we find
that the $J$-dependence of the spectrum exhibits striking evidence of level
repulsion, along with the linear ramp. We also find that varying the profile
leads to natural interpolations between Poisson and Wigner-Dyson(WD)-like
spectra. The linear ramp in our previous work can be understood as arising via
an extreme version of level repulsion in such a limiting spectrum. We also
explain how the stretched horizon/fuzzball is different in these aspects from
simply putting a cut-off in flat space or AdS (ie., without a horizon).

small, imperceptible perturbations that can significantly alter the network's

investigate this latter phenomenon in two contexts: (a) discrete-time dynamical
system identification, and (b) the calibration of a neural network's output to
that of another network. We examine noninvertibility through the lens of
mathematical optimization, where the global solution measures the ``safety"" of
the network predictions by their distance from the non-invertibility boundary.
We formulate mixed-integer programs (MIPs) for ReLU networks and $L_p$ norms
($p=1,2,\infty$) that apply to neural network approximators of dynamical

high-stakes decisions, such as loan approval, job hiring, and criminal bail,
researchers in Explainable AI (XAI) have developed algorithms to provide users
with recourse for an unfavorable outcome. We analyze the incentives for a
decision-maker to offer recourse to a set of applicants. Does the
decision-maker have the incentive to offer recourse to all rejected applicants?
We show that the decision-maker only offers recourse to all applicants in
extreme cases, such as when the recourse process is impossible to manipulate.
Some applicants may be worse off when the decision-maker can offer recourse.

  Attention","CIKM-2022 1st FedGraph workshop",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With the frequent happening of privacy leakage and the enactment of privacy
laws across different countries, data owners are reluctant to directly share
their raw data and labels with any other party. In reality, a lot of these raw
data are stored in the graph database, especially for finance. For
collaboratively building graph neural networks(GNNs), federated learning(FL)
may not be an ideal choice for the vertically partitioned setting where privacy
and efficiency are the main concerns. Moreover, almost all the existing
federated GNNs are mainly designed for homogeneous graphs, which simplify
various types of relations as the same type, thus largely limits their
performance. We bridge this gap by proposing a split learning-based
GNN(SplitGNN), where this model is divided into two sub-models: the local GNN
model includes all the private data related computation to generate local node
embeddings, whereas the global model calculates global embeddings by
aggregating all the participants' local embeddings. Our SplitGNN allows the
isolated heterogeneous neighborhood to be collaboratively utilized. To better
capture representations, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Attention(HAT)
algorithm and use both node-based and path-based attention mechanisms to learn
various types of nodes and edges with multi-hop relation features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our SplitGNN on node classification tasks for
two standard public datasets and the real-world dataset. Extensive experimental
results validate that our proposed SplitGNN significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art(SOTA) methods.

  Data",,,,"cs.CY cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate modeling of student knowledge is essential for large-scale online
learning systems that are increasingly used for student training. Knowledge
tracing aims to model student knowledge state given the student's sequence of
learning activities. Modern Knowledge tracing (KT) is usually formulated as a
supervised sequence learning problem to predict students' future practice
performance according to their past observed practice scores by summarizing
student knowledge state as a set of evolving hidden variables. Because of this
formulation, many current KT solutions are not fit for modeling student
learning from non-assessed learning activities with no explicit feedback or
score observation (e.g., watching video lectures that are not graded).
Additionally, these models cannot explicitly represent the dynamics of
knowledge transfer among different learning activities, particularly between
the assessed (e.g., quizzes) and non-assessed (e.g., video lectures) learning
activities. In this paper, we propose Transition-Aware Multi-activity Knowledge
Tracing (TAMKOT), which models knowledge transfer between learning materials,
in addition to student knowledge, when students transition between and within
assessed and non-assessed learning materials. TAMKOT is formulated as a deep
recurrent multi-activity learning model that explicitly learns knowledge
transfer by activating and learning a set of knowledge transfer matrices, one
for each transition type between student activities. Accordingly, our model
allows for representing each material type in a different yet transferrable
latent space while maintaining student knowledge in a shared space. We evaluate
our model on three real-world publicly available datasets and demonstrate
TAMKOT's capability in predicting student performance and modeling knowledge
transfer.

normal mode MEMS capacitive pressure sensor for blood pressure sensing
application. The normal blood pressure of human being is 120/80 mmHg. But this
range varies in case of any stress, hypertension and some other health issues.
Analytical simulation is implemented using MATLAB. Basically, normal mode
capacitive pressure sensors have a fixed plate and a moveable diaphragm which
deflects on application of pressure with the condition that it must not touch
the fixed plate. Deflection depends on material as well as thickness, shape and
size of diaphragm which can be of circular, elliptical, square or rectangular
shape. In this paper, circular shape is chosen due to higher sensitivity
compared to other diaphragm shapes. Deflection, base capacitance, change in
capacitance after applying pressure and sensitivity are reported for systolic
and diastolic blood pressure monitoring application, and study involves
determining the optimized design for the sensor. Diaphragm deflection shows
linear variation with applied pressure, which follows Hooks law. The variation
in capacitance is logarithmic function of applied pressure, which is utilized
for analytical simulation.

the correct causal direction between two random variables. Significant progress
has been made through modelling the effect as a function of its cause and a
noise term, which allows us to leverage assumptions about the generating
function class. The recently introduced heteroscedastic location-scale noise
functional models (LSNMs) combine expressive power with identifiability
guarantees. LSNM model selection based on maximizing likelihood achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy, when the noise distributions are correctly
specified. However, through an extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate
that the accuracy deteriorates sharply when the form of the noise distribution
is misspecified by the user. Our analysis shows that the failure occurs mainly
when the conditional variance in the anti-causal direction is smaller than that
in the causal direction. As an alternative, we find that causal model selection
through residual independence testing is much more robust to noise
misspecification and misleading conditional variance.

in Chemistry that changes the geometrical placement of the particles inside a
structure. It is called structural relaxation and constitutes a local
minimization problem with a non-convex objective function whose domain
complexity increases according to the number of particles involved. In this
work we study the performance of the two most popular first order optimization
methods in structural relaxation. Although frequently employed, there is a lack
of their study in this context from an algorithmic point of view. We run each
algorithm in combination with a constant step size, which provides a benchmark
for the methods' analysis and direct comparison. We also design dynamic step
size rules and study how these improve the two algorithms' performance. Our
results show that there is a trade-off between convergence rate and the
possibility of an experiment to succeed, hence we construct a function to
assign utility to each method based on our respective preference. The function
is built according to a recently introduced model of preference indication
concerning algorithms with deadline and their run time. Finally, building on
all our insights from the experimental results, we provide algorithmic recipes
that best correspond to each of the presented preferences and select one recipe
as the optimal for equally weighted preferences.
  Alongside our results we present our open source Python software veltiCRYS,
which was used to perform the geometric optimization experiments. Our
implementation, can be easily edited to accommodate other energy functions and
is especially targeted for testing different methods in structural relaxation.

been expressed in terms of a mobility ""$\alpha$-noise"" by Hooge and
Kleinpenning. Understanding this noise in graphene is a key towards
high-performance electronics. Early investigations in diffusive graphene have
pointed out a deviation from the standard Hooge formula, with a modified
expression where the free-carrier density is substituted by a constant density
$n_\Delta\sim10^{12}\;\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. We investigate hBN-encapsulated
graphene transistors where high mobility gives rise to the non-linear
velocity-saturation regime. In this regime, the $\alpha$-noise is accounted for
by substituting conductance by differential conductance $G$, ressulting in a
bell-shape dependence of flicker noise with bias voltage $V$. The same analysis
holds at larger bias in the Zener regime, with two main differences: the first
one is a strong enhancement of the Hooge parameter reflecting the hundred-times
larger coupling of interband excitations to the hyperbolic phonon-polariton
(HPhP) modes of the mid-infrared Reststrahlen (RS) bands of hBN. The second is
an exponential suppression of this coupling at large fields, which we attribute
to decoherence effects. We also show that the HPhP bands control the amplitude
of flicker noise according to the graphene-hBN thermal coupling estimated with
microwave noise thermometry. The phenomenology of $\alpha$-noise in graphene
supports a quantum-coherent bremsstrahlung interpretation of flicker noise.

learning at scale. Yet, despite considerable efforts by the learning analytics
community across the world over the past decade, the evidence to support that
claim is hitherto scarce, as is the demand from educators to adopt it into
their practice. We introduce the concept of practicable learning analytics to
illuminate what learning analytics may look like from the perspective of
practice, and how this practice can be incorporated in learning analytics
designs so as to make them more attractive for practitioners. As a framework
for systematic analysis of the practice in which learning analytics tools and
methods are to be employed, we use the concept of Information Systems Artifact
(ISA) which comprises three interrelated subsystems: the informational, the
social and the technological artefacts. The ISA approach entails systemic
thinking which is necessary for discussing data-driven decision making in the
context of educational systems, practices, and situations. The ten chapters in
this book are presented and reflected upon from the ISA perspective, clarifying

cellular network by leveraging covert communication to hide its presence from
the vigilant adversary. In particular, there are adversaries aiming to detect
D2D communications based on their received signal powers. To avoid being
detected, the legitimate entity, i.e., D2D-underlaid cellular network, performs
power control so as to hide the presence of the D2D communication. We model the
combat between the adversaries and the legitimate entity as a two-stage
Stackelberg game. Therein, the adversaries are the followers and aim to
minimize their detection errors at the lower stage while the legitimate entity
is the leader and aims to maximize its utility constrained by the D2D
communication covertness and the cellular quality of service (QoS) at the upper
stage. Different from the conventional works, the study of the combat is
conducted from the system-level perspective, where the scenario that a
large-scale D2D-underlaid cellular network threatened by massive spatially
distributed adversaries is considered and the network spatial configuration is
modeled by stochastic geometry. We obtain the adversary's optimal strategy as
the best response from the lower stage and also both analytically and
numerically verify its optimality. Taking into account the best response from
the lower stage, we design a bi-level algorithm based on the successive convex
approximation (SCA) method to search for the optimal strategy of the legitimate
entity, which together with the best response from the lower stage constitute
the Stackelberg equilibrium. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the
network performance and reveal practical insights that instead of improving the
legitimate utility by strengthening the D2D link reliability, increasing D2D

this article, we highlight the important influence of the temporal distance

can be collected too late: forgetting is a widely acknowledged challenge for
accurate descriptions of past experience. For this reason, methods striving for
assessment as early as possible have become increasingly popular. However, here
we argue that collection may also occur too early: descriptions about very
recent stimuli might be collected before emotional processing has fully
converged. Based on these notions, we champion the existence of a temporal
distance for each type of stimulus that maximizes the validity of self-reports
-- a ""right"" time. Consequently, we recommend future research to (1)
consciously consider the potential influence of temporal distance on affective
self-reports when planning data collection, (2) document the temporal distance
of affective self-reports wherever possible as part of corpora for
computational modelling, and finally (3) and explore the effect of temporal
distance on self-reports across different types of stimuli.

promising research area that this dissertation focuses on is visual and
language understanding which involves many challenging tasks, i.e.,

methodology that we can first extract external knowledge and then integrate it
with the original models. The external knowledge has to be extracted from the

performance by seeking flat minima. To minimize the maximum loss within a
neighborhood in the parameter space, SAM uses an ascent step, which perturbs
the weights along the direction of gradient ascent with a given radius. While
single-step or multi-step can be taken during ascent steps, previous studies
have shown that multi-step ascent SAM rarely improves generalization
performance. However, this phenomenon is particularly interesting because the
multi-step ascent is expected to provide a better approximation of the maximum
neighborhood loss. Therefore, in this paper, we analyze the effect of the
number of ascent steps and investigate the difference between both single-step
ascent SAM and multi-step ascent SAM. We identify the effect of the number of
ascent on SAM optimization and reveal that single-step ascent SAM and
multi-step ascent SAM exhibit distinct loss landscapes. Based on these
observations, we finally suggest a simple modification that can mitigate the

imaging (MRI) because it leads to patient discomfort and motion artifacts.
Although several MRI techniques have been proposed to reduce the acquisition
time, compressed sensing in magnetic resonance imaging (CS-MRI) enables fast
acquisition without compromising SNR and resolution. However, existing CS-MRI
methods suffer from the challenge of aliasing artifacts. This challenge results
in the noise-like textures and missing the fine details, thus leading to
unsatisfactory reconstruction performance. To tackle this challenge, we propose
a hierarchical perception adversarial learning framework (HP-ALF). HP-ALF can
perceive the image information in the hierarchical mechanism: image-level
perception and patch-level perception. The former can reduce the visual
perception difference in the entire image, and thus achieve aliasing artifact
removal. The latter can reduce this difference in the regions of the image, and
thus recover fine details. Specifically, HP-ALF achieves the hierarchical
mechanism by utilizing multilevel perspective discrimination. This
discrimination can provide the information from two perspectives (overall and
regional) for adversarial learning. It also utilizes a global and local
coherent discriminator to provide structure information to the generator during
training. In addition, HP-ALF contains a context-aware learning block to
effectively exploit the slice information between individual images for better
reconstruction performance. The experiments validated on three datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of HP-ALF and its superiority to the comparative
methods.

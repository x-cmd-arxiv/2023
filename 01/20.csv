relation between the Boyer-Lindquist variables and the action-angle ones, while
it generates in analytical closed form all the characteristic functions of the
system as well. The expressed in the action-angle variable Hamiltonian system
is employed to model an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI), i.e. a binary
system where a stellar compact object inspirals into a supermassive black hole
due to gravitational radiation reaction. We consider the adiabatic evolution of
an EMRI, for which the energy and angular momentum fluxes are computed by
solving the Teukolsky equation in the frequency domain. To achieve this a new
Teukolsky equation solver code was developed.

We find that several fragmented boulder morphologies are equivalent to

characterized by an internal weakening period with limited morphological signs

estimation methods that auto-create avatars for users, however, often fail to
work because of the domain gap between realistic faces and stylized avatar
images. To this end, we propose SwiftAvatar, a novel avatar auto-creation
framework that is evidently superior to previous works. SwiftAvatar introduces
dual-domain generators to create pairs of realistic faces and avatar images
using shared latent codes. The latent codes can then be bridged with the avatar
vectors as pairs, by performing GAN inversion on the avatar images rendered
from the engine using avatar vectors. Through this way, we are able to
synthesize paired data in high-quality as many as possible, consisting of
avatar vectors and their corresponding realistic faces. We also propose
semantic augmentation to improve the diversity of synthesis. Finally, a
light-weight avatar vector estimator is trained on the synthetic pairs to
implement efficient auto-creation. Our experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of SwiftAvatar on two different avatar engines.
The superiority and advantageous flexibility of SwiftAvatar are also verified
in both subjective and objective evaluations.

the lumen segmentation sub-network is supervised. The two sub-networks are
interconnected with pathways that enable information exchange and thereby
mutual learning. As the lumen is in the image's deepest visual space, lumen
segmentation helps with the depth estimation at the farthest location. In turn,
the estimated depth guides the lumen segmentation network as the lumen location
defines the farthest scene location. Unlike other environments, view synthesis
often fails in the colon because of the deformable wall, textureless surface,
specularities, and wide field of view image distortions, all challenges that
our pipeline addresses. We conducted qualitative analysis on a synthetic

The current correlation-based methods construct pair-wise feature correlations
to establish the many-to-many matching because the typical prototype-based
approaches cannot learn fine-grained correspondence relations. However, the
existing methods still suffer from the noise contained in naive correlations
and the lack of context semantic information in correlations. To alleviate
these problems mentioned above, we propose a Feature-Enhanced Context-Aware
Network (FECANet). Specifically, a feature enhancement module is proposed to
suppress the matching noise caused by inter-class local similarity and enhance
the intra-class relevance in the naive correlation. In addition, we propose a
novel correlation reconstruction module that encodes extra correspondence
relations between foreground and background and multi-scale context semantic
features, significantly boosting the encoder to capture a reliable matching
pattern. Experiments on PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$ datasets demonstrate that
our proposed FECANet leads to remarkable improvement compared to previous
state-of-the-arts, demonstrating its effectiveness.

signals as planetary using followup observations for four new TESS planets,
including TOI 198 b, TOI 244 b, TOI 444 b, and TOI 470 b. While a three times
increase in primary mirror size should mean that one CHEOPS transit yields an
equivalent model uncertainty in transit depth as about nine TESS transits under
ideal conditions, we find that our CHEOPS transits typically yield
uncertainties equivalent to between 2 and 12 TESS transits, averaging 5.9
equivalent transits. Therefore, we find that while our fits to CHEOPS transits
provide overall lower uncertainties on transit depth and better precision
relative to fits to TESS transits, our uncertainties for these fits do not
always match expected predictions given photon-limited noise. We find no
correlations between number of equivalent transits and any physical parameters,
indicating that this behavior is not strictly systematic, but rather might be
due to other factors such as in-transit gaps during CHEOPS visits or
non-homogeneous detrending of CHEOPS light curves.

neutron matter equation of state (EOS) produced by an accurate N$^3$LO
calculation in chiral effective field theory. Depending on the strength of the
non-linear scalar vector field contribution, we have found three distinct
classes of EOSs, each one correlated to different star properties
distributions. If the non-linear vector field contribution is absent, the
gravitational maximum mass and the sound velocity at high densities are the
greatest. However, it also gives the smallest speed of sound at densities below
three times saturation density. On the other hand, models with the strongest
non-linear vector field contribution predict the largest radii and tidal
deformabilities for 1.4 M$_\odot$ stars, together with the smallest mass for
the onset of the nucleonic direct Urca processes and the smallest central
baryonic densities for the maximum mass configuration. These models have the
largest speed of sound below three times saturation density, but the smallest
at high densities, in particular, above four times saturation density the speed
of sound decreases approaching approximately $\sqrt{0.4}c$ at the center of the
maximum mass star. On the contrary, a weak non-linear vector contribution gives
a monotonically increasing speed of sound. A 2.75 M$_\odot$ NS maximum mass was
obtained in the tail of the posterior with a weak non-linear vector field

that enables jointly training a global model without sharing clients' data.
However, its repetitive server-client communication gives room for backdoor
attacks with aim to mislead the global model into a targeted misprediction when
a specific trigger pattern is presented. In response to such backdoor threats
on federated learning, various defense measures have been proposed. In this
paper, we study whether the current defense mechanisms truly neutralize the
backdoor threats from federated learning in a practical setting by proposing a
new federated backdoor attack method for possible countermeasures. Different
from traditional training (on triggered data) and rescaling (the malicious
client model) based backdoor injection, the proposed backdoor attack framework
(1) directly modifies (a small proportion of) local model weights to inject the
backdoor trigger via sign flips; (2) jointly optimize the trigger pattern with
the client model, thus is more persistent and stealthy for circumventing
existing defenses. In a case study, we examine the strength and weaknesses of
recent federated backdoor defenses from three major categories and provide
suggestions to the practitioners when training federated models in practice.

feature, with most models focused on reproducing only their timing behavior.
Previously, the Accretion-Ejection Instability (AEI) predicted the existence of
a more subtle effect on their energy spectrum. In the case of LMXB, that effect
was deemed impossible to detect. While the AEI can be naturally expanded to
higher-mass systems, there was no observational drive to do it until now.
However the several (candidate) QPOs detected in supermassive black hole
sources in the last decade, now seems the right moment to explore the
applicability of the AEI model. Using our numerical observatory, we compute the
different observables for a system with the AEI active and we take advantage of
the longer timescale coming from the higher mass system, to see if the effect
on the energy spectrum hinted at in LMXB, could become detectable. After
confirming that the AEI causes an imprint of the QPO on the energy spectrum
that should reach detectable levels in SMBH, we turned to observations of 2XMM
J123103.2 and performed a proof of concept spectro-timing fit of the QPO pulse
profile simultaneously with how its energy spectrum changes along it. While the
limited 2XMM J123103.2 data showed the predicted effect at only $1.7\sigma$, it
is fully consistent with the AEI model and hence worthy of further
investigation in other systems.

of the BS precoding matrix and the IRS reflecting coefficient vector is
formulated. To address this high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem,
we propose a novel unsupervised deep neural network (DNN) based algorithm with

obtains the BS precoding and IRS phase shifts as the output of the DNN.
Simulation results reveal that the proposed DNN-based algorithm outperforms the

Our results are divided into three different categories.
  1. We show a quantitative generalization of the 100 year-old Perron-Frobenius
theorem, a fundamental theorem which has been used within diverse areas of
mathematics. The Perron-Frobenius theorem states that every irreducible
nonnegative matrix $R$ has a largest positive eigenvalue $r$, and every other
eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $R$ is such that $\text{Re}\lambda<r$ and
$|\lambda|\leq r$. We capture the notion of irreducibility through the widely
studied notion of edge expansion $\phi$ of $R$ which intuitively measures how
well-connected the underlying digraph of $R$ is, and show a quantitative
relation between the spectral gap $\Delta=1-\text{Re}\lambda/r$ (where
$\lambda\not=r$ is the eigenvalue of $R$ with the largest real part) and the
edge expansion $\phi$, providing a more general result than the Cheeger-Buser
inequalities, as
follows.\[\dfrac{1}{15}\cdot\dfrac{\Delta(R)}{n}\leq\phi(R)\leq\sqrt{2\cdot\Delta(R)}.\]
  2. We study constructions of specific nonsymmetric matrices (or nonreversible
Markov Chains) that have small edge expansion but large spectral gap, and
provide a novel construction of a nonreversible chain for
which\[\phi(R)\leq\dfrac{\Delta(R)}{\sqrt{n}},\] and we also present a
candidate construction of matrices for
which\[\phi(R)\leq2\dfrac{\Delta(R)}{n},\] which is the most beautiful
contribution of this thesis.
  3. We connect edge expansion and spectral gap to other combinatorial
properties of nonsymmetric matrices, such as mixing time and capacity, and
provide elementary proofs or unified views of known results and new results

  Size","17 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tsetlin machine (TM) is a logic-based machine learning approach with the
crucial advantages of being transparent and hardware-friendly. While TMs match
or surpass deep learning accuracy for an increasing number of applications,
large clause pools tend to produce clauses with many literals (long clauses).
As such, they become less interpretable. Further, longer clauses increase the
switching activity of the clause logic in hardware, consuming more power. This
paper introduces a novel variant of TM learning - Clause Size Constrained TMs
(CSC-TMs) - where one can set a soft constraint on the clause size. As soon as
a clause includes more literals than the constraint allows, it starts expelling
literals. Accordingly, oversized clauses only appear transiently. To evaluate
CSC-TM, we conduct classification, clustering, and regression experiments on
tabular data, natural language text, images, and board games. Our results show
that CSC-TM maintains accuracy with up to 80 times fewer literals. Indeed, the
accuracy increases with shorter clauses for TREC, IMDb, and BBC Sports. After
the accuracy peaks, it drops gracefully as the clause size approaches a single
literal. We finally analyze CSC-TM power consumption and derive new convergence
properties.

Jupiters'') have been the subject of extensive efforts to determine their
atmospheric properties using thermal emission measurements from the Hubble and
Spitzer Space Telescopes. However, previous studies have yielded inconsistent
results because the small sizes of the spectral features and the limited
information content of the data resulted in high sensitivity to the varying
assumptions made in the treatment of instrument systematics and the atmospheric
retrieval analysis. Here we present a dayside thermal emission spectrum of the
ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18b obtained with the NIRISS instrument on JWST. The
data span 0.85 to 2.85 $\mu$m in wavelength at an average resolving power of
400 and exhibit minimal systematics. The spectrum shows three water emission
features (at $>$6$\sigma$ confidence) and evidence for optical opacity,
possibly due to H$^-$, TiO, and VO (combined significance of 3.8$\sigma$).
Models that fit the data require a thermal inversion, molecular dissociation as
predicted by chemical equilibrium, a solar heavy element abundance
(''metallicity'', M/H = 1.03$_{-0.51}^{+1.11}$ $\times$ solar), and a
carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio less than unity. The data also yield a dayside
brightness temperature map, which shows a peak in temperature near the
sub-stellar point that decreases steeply and symmetrically with longitude
toward the terminators.

  Applications",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Contrastive learning is widely used for sentence representation learning.
Despite this prevalence, most studies have focused exclusively on English and
few concern domain adaptation for domain-specific downstream tasks, especially
for low-resource languages like Japanese, which are characterized by
insufficient target domain data and the lack of a proper training strategy. To
overcome this, we propose a novel Japanese sentence representation framework,
JCSE (derived from ``Contrastive learning of Sentence Embeddings for
Japanese''), that creates training data by generating sentences and
synthesizing them with sentences available in a target domain. Specifically, a
pre-trained data generator is finetuned to a target domain using our collected
corpus. It is then used to generate contradictory sentence pairs that are used
in contrastive learning for adapting a Japanese language model to a specific
task in the target domain.
  Another problem of Japanese sentence representation learning is the
difficulty of evaluating existing embedding methods due to the lack of
benchmark datasets. Thus, we establish a comprehensive Japanese Semantic
Textual Similarity (STS) benchmark on which various embedding models are
evaluated. Based on this benchmark result, multiple embedding methods are
chosen and compared with JCSE on two domain-specific tasks, STS in a clinical
domain and information retrieval in an educational domain. The results show
that JCSE achieves significant performance improvement surpassing direct
transfer and other training strategies. This empirically demonstrates JCSE's
effectiveness and practicability for downstream tasks of a low-resource
language.

and cosmology. Due to their extragalactic and cosmological origin, they are
useful to study the cosmic expansion and the intergalactic medium (IGM). In the
literature, the dispersion measure DM of FRB has been considered extensively.
It could be used as an indirect proxy of the luminosity distance $d_L$ of FRB.
The observed DM contains the contributions from the Milky Way (MW), the MW
halo, IGM, and the host galaxy. Unfortunately, IGM and the host galaxy of FRB
are poorly known to date, and hence the large uncertainties of $\rm DM_{IGM}$
and $\rm DM_{host}$ in DM plague the FRB cosmology. Could we avoid DM in
studying cosmology? Could we instead consider the luminosity distance $d_L$
directly in the FRB cosmology? We are interested to find a way out for this
problem in the present work. From the lessons of calibrating type Ia supernovae
(SNIa) or long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as standard candles, we consider a
universal subclassification scheme for FRBs, and there are some empirical
relations for them. In the present work, we propose to calibrate type Ib FRBs
as standard candles by using a tight empirical relation without DM. The
calibrated type Ib FRBs at high redshifts can be used like SNIa to constrain
the cosmological models. We also test the key factors affecting the calibration
and the cosmological constraints.

demonstrate, and estimate the potential impacts of two different protocols that
enhance, through motional parametric excitation, the coherent spin-motion
coupling of ions obtained with a spin-dependent force. The experiments are
performed on 2D crystal arrays of approximately one hundred $^9$Be$^+$ ions
confined in a Penning trap. By modulating the trapping potential at close to
twice the center-of-mass mode frequency, we squeeze the motional mode and
enhance the spin-motion coupling while maintaining spin coherence. With a
stroboscopic protocol, we measure $5.4 \pm 0.9$ dB of motional squeezing below
the ground-state motion, from which theory predicts a $10$ dB enhancement in
the sensitivity for measuring small displacements using a recently demonstrated
protocol [Science $\textbf{373}$, 673 (2021)]. With a continuous squeezing
protocol, we measure and accurately calibrate the parametric coupling strength.
Theory suggests this protocol can be used to improve quantum spin squeezing,
limited in our system by off-resonant light scatter. We illustrate numerically
the trade-offs between strong parametric amplification and motional dephasing
in the form of center-of-mass frequency fluctuations for improving quantum spin
squeezing in our set-up.

Spanning the wide bandgap of amorphous InGaZnO$_x$ (a-IGZO), UBPC identifies
seven oxygen-deep donor vacancy peaks that are independently confirmed by
energetically matching to photoluminescence emission peaks. The sub-gap DoS
from 15 different types of a-IGZO TFTs all yield similar DoS, except only
back-channel etch TFTs can have a deep acceptor peak seen at 2.2 eV below the
conduction band mobility edge. This deep acceptor is likely a zinc vacancy,
evidenced by trap density which becomes 5-6x larger when TFT wet-etch methods
are employed. Certain DoS peaks are strongly enhanced for TFTs with active
channel processing damage caused by plasma exposure. While Ar implantation and
He plasma processing damage are similar, Ar plasma yields more disorder showing
a 2x larger valence-band Urbach energy and two orders of magnitude increase in
the deep oxygen vacancy trap density. Changing the growth conditions of a-IGZO
also impacts the DoS, with zinc-rich TFTs showing much poorer electrical
performance compared to 1:1:1 molar ratio a-IGZO TFTs owing to the former
having a ~10xlarger oxygen vacancy trap density. Finally, hydrogen is found to
behave as a donor in amorphous indium tin gallium zinc oxide TFTs.

  framework of Markovian quantum state diffusion",,,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The reduced density matrix that characterises the state of an open quantum
system is a projection from the full density matrix of the quantum system and
its environment, and there are many full density matrices consistent with a
given reduced version. Without a specification of relevant details of the
environment, the evolution of a reduced density matrix is therefore typically
unpredictable, even if the dynamics are deterministic. With this in mind, we
investigate a two level open quantum system using a framework of quantum state
diffusion. We consider the pseudorandom evolution of its reduced density matrix
when subjected to an environment-driven process of continuous quantum
measurement of a system observable, using dynamics that asymptotically send the
system to an eigenstate. The unpredictability is characterised by a stochastic
entropy production, the average of which corresponds to an increase in the
subjective uncertainty of the quantum state adopted by the system and
environment, given the underspecified dynamics. This differs from a change in
von Neumann entropy, and can continue indefinitely as the system is guided
towards an eigenstate. As one would expect, the simultaneous measurement of two
non-commuting observables within the same framework does not send the system to
an eigenstate. Instead, the probability density function describing the reduced
density matrix of the system becomes stationary over a continuum of pure
states, a situation characterised by zero further stochastic entropy
production. Transitions between such stationary states, brought about by
changes in the relative strengths of the two measurement processes, give rise
to finite positive mean stochastic entropy production. The framework
investigated can offer useful perspectives on both the dynamics and
irreversible thermodynamics of measurement in quantum systems.

The equilibrium correlation-length critical exponents are obtained from the
scaling laws which are consistent with previous results. Furthermore, we study
dynamical quantum phase transitions by analyzing the Loschmidt echo and the
order parameter for any $q$ upon a big quench. For $q \leq 4$, we show that
dynamical quantum phase transitions can be described by the Loschmidt echo and
the zeros of the order parameter. In particular, we find the rate function
increases logarithmically with $q$ at the first critical time. However, for $q

Mass-splittings due to SU3 breakings are tiny (< 50 MeV). Though more
accessible experimentally, Class L states have weaker couplings to the currents

between the 1st radial excitation and the ground state are about 2 GeV which
are (almost) heavy flavour and current-type independent while their couplings
are large signaling new dynamics of these exotic states. Quark masses

The majority of known SySts so far are identified based on selection criteria

faint optical emission lines uncloaked a subgroup of SySts with accreting-only
white dwarfs. In this particular case, the luminous red giant may overshadow
the dimmed white dwarf companion. A new approach to search for this subgroup of
SySts is presented, employing GALEX UV and 2MASS/AllWISE IR photometry. The
FUV-NUV colour index is an indicator, direct or indirect, for the presence of
hot compact companions. The cross-match of the Catalogue of Variable Stars III
obtained from the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae with the GALEX, 2MASS

From them, 105 sources have photometric measurements from both FUV and NUV

SySts. Five known SySts are recovered, while two new genuine SySts are
discovered in spectroscopic follow-up observations after the detection of the

sequentially and the inferential aim is to estimate, on-the-fly, a static
parameter regarding the population to which those individuals belong. We
propose sequential Monte Carlo to perform online Bayesian estimation. When
individuals provide sensitive information in response to a query, it is
necessary to perturb it with privacy-preserving noise to ensure the privacy of
those individuals. The amount of perturbation is proportional to the
sensitivity of the query, which is determined usually by the range of the
queried information. The truncation technique we propose adapts to the
previously collected observations to adjust the query range for the next
individual. The idea is that, based on previous observations, we can carefully
arrange the interval into which the next individual's information is to be
truncated before being perturbed with privacy-preserving noise. In this way, we
aim to design predictive queries with small sensitivity, hence small
privacy-preserving noise, enabling more accurate estimation while maintaining
the same level of privacy. To decide on the location and the width of the
interval, we use an exploration-exploitation approach a la Thompson sampling
with an objective function based on the Fisher information of the generated
observation. We show the merits of our methodology with numerical examples.

particles primarily interacting with two photons and predicted by superstring
and superbrane theories, have come to help by solving two distinct problems
about blazars (a type of active galactic nuclei), thus providing two hints at
the existence of ALPs themselves. In the presence of an external magnetic
field, ALPs produce: (i) photon-ALP oscillations, (ii) the change of the
polarization state of photons. The former effect has many consequences in the
astrophysical contest, such as the modification of the transparency of the
Universe and the alteration of the astrophysical spectra. We address here the
latter effect by analyzing how the photon degree of linear polarization and the
polarization angle get modified by photon-ALP interaction in the case where
photons are generated at the jet base of some BL Lacs (a blazar class): OJ 287,
BL Lacertae, Markarian 501 and 1ES 0229+200, by considering both a leptonic and
hadronic emission mechanism. We show that OJ 287 and BL Lacertae are good
observational targets for ALP studies both in the X-ray band with IXPE (already
operative) and with the proposed eXTP, XL-Calibur, NGXP and XPP missions and in
the high-energy range with the COSI, e-ASTROGAM and AMEGO missions, while 1ES
0229+200 represents a strong candidate in the X-ray band only. Since these
blazars show a very high final photon degree of linear polarization, which
cannot be explained by conventional physics, such a possible detection would
represent an additional hint at the ALP existence. Instead, Markarian 501 does
not appear as a good target for these studies. We conclude that all these
observatories can give us additional fundamental information about ALP physics.

test parity violation in gravity and to distinguish between the primordial or
the astrophysical origin of the stochastic background. This property comes from
the expected unpolarized nature of the homogeneous and isotropic astrophysical
background, contrary to some specific cosmological sources that can produce a
polarized background. However, in this work we show that there is a
non-negligible amount of circular polarization also in the astrophysical
background, generated by Poisson fluctuations in the number of unresolved
sources, which can be detected by the third-generation interferometers with
signal-to-noise ratio larger than one. We also explain in which cases the
gravitational wave maps can be cleaned from this extra source of noise,
exploiting the frequency and the angular dependence, in order to search for
signals from the early Universe. Future studies about the detection of
polarized cosmological backgrounds with ground- and space-based interferometers

where $T$ is a random subset of the set of elements covered by $x$. We focus on
estimating $\mathcal E(L)$, the expected number of steps of ${\bf U}_L$ needed
to get from the top element of $L$ to the bottom element of $L$. Using direct
combinatorial arguments, we provide asymptotic estimates when $L$ is the weak
order on the symmetric group $S_n$ and when $L$ is the $n$-th Tamari lattice.
When $L$ is distributive, the Markov chain ${\bf U}_L$ is equivalent to an
instance of the well-studied random process known as last-passage percolation
with geometric weights. One of our main results states that if $L$ is a trim
lattice, then $\mathcal E(L)\leq\mathcal E(\text{spine}(L))$, where
$\text{spine}(L)$ is a specific distributive sublattice of $L$ called the spine
of $L$. Combining this lattice-theoretic theorem with known results about

mainly focus on node-wise correlation when doing weighted aggregation of

doing information propagation. To solve this problem, we propose a General
Information Propagation Algorithm (GIPA in short), which exploits more

bit-wise correlation calculates the element-wise attention weight through a
multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based on the dense representations of two nodes
and their edge; The feature-wise correlation is based on the one-hot
representations of node attribute features for feature selection. We evaluate

that GIPA outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of prediction

which leads to upper and lower bounds on the optimal sample complexity for a
general class of problems encompassing bandits and reinforcement learning with
function approximation. In this paper, we introduce a new variant of the DEC,
the Constrained Decision-Estimation Coefficient, and use it to derive new lower
bounds that improve upon prior work on three fronts:
  - They hold in expectation, with no restrictions on the class of algorithms
under consideration.
  - They hold globally, and do not rely on the notion of localization used by
Foster et al. (2021).
  - Most interestingly, they allow the reference model with respect to which

play a fundamental role.

\mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n$ whose Jacobian determinant is a nonzero
constant) has a compositional inverse which is also a polynomial. The Jacobian
conjecture may be formulated in terms of a problem involving labellings of
rooted trees; we give a new probabilistic derivation of this formulation using
multi-type branching processes. Thereafter, we develop a simple and novel
approach to the Jacobian conjecture in terms of a problem about shuffling
subtrees of $d$-Catalan trees, i.e. planar $d$-ary trees. We also show that, if
one can construct a certain Markov chain on large $d$-Catalan trees which
updates its value by randomly shuffling certain nearby subtrees, and in such a
way that the stationary distribution of this chain is uniform, then the
Jacobian conjecture is true. Finally, we show that the subtree shuffling
conjecture is true in a certain asymptotic sense, and thereafter use our
machinery to prove an approximate version of the Jacobian conjecture, stating
that inverses of Keller maps have small power series coefficients for their
high degree terms.

asymptotically approach equilibrium, i.e., the zero energy state, without ever
reaching it exactly, and that the solution of the critical damping regime
approaches equilibrium faster than the underdamped or the overdamped solution.
Experimentally, the systems described with this model reach an equilibrium
state which is not exactly a zero energy state, but rather a state where the
system's energy has dropped below some threshold corresponding to the energy
resolution of the measuring apparatus. We show that one can always find an
optimal solution in the underdamped regime that will reach this energy
threshold sooner than all other underdamped solutions, as well as the
critically damped solution, no matter how small this threshold is. We also
comment on an exception to this for a particular type of initial conditions,
when a specific overdamped solution reaches the equilibrium state sooner than
all other solutions. We confirm some of our findings experimentally.

to infinitely long-lived coherent dynamics when the system is prepared in a

protocols both for individual scar states in a particular model, as well as
superpositions of them that give rise to coherent dynamics. For superpositions
of scar states, we present both a system-size-linear depth unitary and a
finite-depth nonunitary state preparation protocol, the latter of which uses
measurement and postselection to reduce the circuit depth. For individual
scarred eigenstates, we formulate an exact state preparation approach based on
matrix product states that yields quasipolynomial-depth circuits, as well as a
variational approach with a polynomial-depth ansatz circuit. We also provide
proof of principle state-preparation demonstrations on superconducting quantum

that the olivine, Mg-Al spinel, and alabandite-oldhamite formed by equilibrium

condensation, all in an M-type AGB star envelope. On the other hand, the
magnetite subgrains are likely the result of aqueous alteration on the
Semarkona asteroidal parent body. Additional evidence of secondary processing
includes Fe-enrichment in the Mg-Al spinel and olivine, elevated Al contents in
the olivine, and beam sensitivity and a modulated structure for the olivine.
Compound presolar grains record condensation conditions over a wide range of

in a composite grain can impart information on the relative rates and effects
of post-condensation processing in a range of environments, including the
interstellar medium, solar nebula, and the host asteroid parent body. The TEM

are established, and it is shown that a large class of non-linear models in the
latent space (e.g., causal mechanisms parameterized by two-layer neural
networks) satisfy these conditions. These sufficient conditions ensure that the
effect of an intervention can be detected correctly from changes in the score.
Capitalizing on this property, recovering a valid transformation is facilitated
by the following key property: any valid transformation renders latent
variables' score function to necessarily have the minimal variations across
different interventional environments. This property is leveraged for perfect
recovery of the latent DAG structure using only \emph{soft} interventions. For
the special case of stochastic \emph{hard} interventions, with an additional
hypothesis testing step, one can also uniquely recover the linear

tracks the mosquito life stages, including egg, larva, and adult (male and

transmission of Wolbachia through infected females and cytoplasmic
incompatibility, which effectively sterilizes uninfected females when they mate
with infected males. We derived and interpreted dimensionless numbers,
including the basic reproductive number and next-generation numbers. The
proposed system presents backward bifurcation, which indicates a threshold
infection that needs to be exceeded to establish a stable Wolbachia infection.
The sensitivity analysis ranks the relative importance of the epidemiological
parameters at the baseline. We simulate different intervention scenarios,
including pre-release mitigation using larviciding and thermal fogging before
the release, multiple releases of infected populations, and different release
timing. Our simulations show that the most efficient approach to establishing
Wolbachia is to release all the infected mosquitoes immediately after the
pre-release mitigation process. Also, the model predicts that it is more

message complexity of $n f(n)$ requires $\Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{\log

the node IDs are chosen from a relatively small set of size $\Theta(n\log n)$,

the synchronous clique under simultaneous wake-up is to show that $\Omega(n\log

deterministic algorithm with a termination time $T(n)$. We complement this
result by giving a simple deterministic algorithm that achieves leader election
in sublinear time while sending only $o(n\log n)$ messages, if the ID space is
of at most linear size. We also show that Las Vegas algorithms (that never
fail) require $\Theta(n)$ messages. For the synchronous clique under

chemo-thermal evolution of gas in the Early Universe, as it dissociates H2
molecules, the primary cooling channel in an environment devoid of metals and
dust. Despite its important role, it is still not implemented in cosmological
simulations on a regular basis, in contrast to the ionising UV background. This
is in part due to uncertainty in the source modelling, their spectra and
abundance, as well as the detailed physics involved in the propagation of the
photons and their interactions with the molecules. The goal of this work is to
produce an accurate model of the LW radiation field at $z\geq6$, by
post-processing the physics-rich high-resolution FiBY simulation. Our novelties
include updated cross sections for H$_2$, H$^-$ and H$^+_2$ chemical species,
IGM absorption by neutral Hydrogen and various spectral models for Population
III and Population II stars. With our fiducial set of parameters, we show that
the mean LW intensity steadily increases by three orders of magnitude from
$z\sim23$ to $z\sim6$, while spatial inhomogeneities originate from massive
star-forming galaxies that dominate the photon budget up to a distance of
$\sim100$ proper kpc. Our model can be easily applied to other simulations or
semi-analytical models as an external radiation field that regulates the
formation of stars and massive black hole seeds in high-$z$ low-mass halos.

introduce the Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA), a
non-generative approach for self-supervised learning from images. The idea
behind I-JEPA is simple: from a single context block, predict the
representations of various target blocks in the same image. A core design
choice to guide I-JEPA towards producing semantic representations is the
masking strategy; specifically, it is crucial to (a) sample target blocks with
sufficiently large scale (semantic), and to (b) use a sufficiently informative
(spatially distributed) context block. Empirically, when combined with Vision
Transformers, we find I-JEPA to be highly scalable. For instance, we train a
ViT-Huge/14 on ImageNet using 16 A100 GPUs in under 72 hours to achieve strong
downstream performance across a wide range of tasks, from linear classification
to object counting and depth prediction.

Hamiltonian at criticality has a universal logarithmic scaling with a prefactor
given by the central charge $c$ of the underlying 1+1d conformal field theory.
When the system is probed by measurements, the entanglement in the critical
ground state is inevitably affected due to wavefunction collapse. In this
paper, we study the effect of weak measurements on the entanglement scaling in
the ground state of the one-dimensional critical transverse-field Ising model.
For the measurements of the spins along their transverse spin axis, we identify
interesting post-measurement states associated with spatially uniform
measurement outcomes. The EE in these states still satisfies the logarithmic
scaling but with an alternative prefactor given by the effective central charge
$c_{\text{eff}}$. We derive the analytical expression of $c_{\text{eff}}$ as a
function of the measurement strength. Using numerical simulations, we show that
for the EE averaged over all post-measurement states based on their Born-rule
probabilities, the numerically extracted effective central charge appears to be
independent of the measurement strength, contrary to the usual expectation that
local and non-overlapping measurements reduce the entanglement in the system.
We also examine the behavior of the average EE under (biased) forced
measurements where the measurement outcomes are sampled with a pre-determined
probability distribution without inter-site correlations. In particular, we
find an optimal probability distribution that can serve as a mean-field
approximation to the Born-rule probabilities and lead to the same
$c_{\text{eff}}$ behavior. The effects of the measurements along the
longitudinal spin axis and the post-measurement correlation functions are also
discussed.

the best approach for retrieving L dwarf spectra, isolating the challenges in
the absence of cloud opacity. We conducted atmospheric retrievals on synthetic

pressure layers probed in the near-IR are mostly convective; parameterized PT
profiles bias results and free, unsmoothed profiles should be used. Only when
many layers both above and below the radiative-convective boundary are probed
can parameterized profiles provide accurate results. Furthermore, a nonuniform

star formation histories (SFHs), to disky with smooth SFHs. But even in
simulations, the direct physical cause of such transitions remains unclear. We
therefore explore this in a large suite of numerical experiments re-running
portions of cosmological simulations with widely varied physics, further
validated with existing FIRE simulations. We show that gas supply,
cooling/thermodynamics, star formation model, Toomre scale, galaxy dynamical
times, and feedback properties do not have a direct causal effect on these
transitions. Rather, both the formation of disks and cessation of bursty star
formation are driven by the gravitational potential, but in different ways.
Disk formation is promoted when the mass profile becomes sufficiently
centrally-concentrated in shape (relative to circularization radii): we show
that this provides a well-defined dynamical center, ceases to support the
global 'breathing modes' which can persist indefinitely in less-concentrated
profiles and efficiently destroy disks, promotes orbit mixing to form a
coherent angular momentum, and stabilizes the disk. Smooth SF is promoted by
the potential or escape velocity (not circular velocity) becoming sufficiently
large at the radii of star formation that cool, mass-loaded
(momentum-conserving) outflows are trapped/confined near the galaxy, as opposed
to escaping after bursts. We discuss the detailed physics, how these conditions
arise in cosmological contexts, their relation to other correlated phenomena

high resolution simulations of spiral galaxies with time-dependent chemistry
such that we can track the formation of the CNM, its distribution within the
galaxy, and its correlation with star formation. We find no strong radial
dependence between the CNM fraction and total HI due to the decreasing
interstellar radiation field counterbalancing the decreasing gas column density
at larger galactic radii.However, the CNM fraction does increase in spiral arms
where the CNM distribution is clumpy, rather than continuous, overlapping more
closely with H2. The CNM doesn't extend out radially as far as HI, and the
vertical scale height is smaller in the outer galaxy compared to HI with no
flaring. The CNM column density scales with total midplane pressure and
disappears from the gas phase below values of PT/kB =1000 K/cm3. We find that
the star formation rate density follows a similar scaling law with CNM column
density to the total gas Kennicutt-Schmidt law. In the outer galaxy we produce
realistic vertical velocity dispersions in the HI purely from galactic dynamics
but our models do not predict CNM at the extremely large radii observed in HI
absorption studies of the Milky Way. We suggest that extended spiral arms might

space, on the ground state of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model
(TFIM) at criticality. Local degrees of freedom in critical states exhibit
long-range entanglement and, as a result, local measurements can have highly
nonlocal effects. Our analytical investigation of correlations and entanglement
in the ensemble of measured states is based on properties of the Ising
conformal field theory (CFT), where measurements appear as (1+0)-dimensional
defects in the (1+1)-dimensional Euclidean spacetime. So that we can verify our
predictions using large-scale free-fermion numerics, we restrict ourselves to
parity-symmetric measurements. To describe their averaged effect analytically
we use a replica approach, and we show that the defect arising in the replica
theory is an irrelevant perturbation to the Ising CFT. Strikingly, the
asymptotic scaling of averaged correlations and entanglement entropy are
therefore unchanged relative to the ground state. In contrast, the defect
generated by postselecting on the most likely measurement outcomes is exactly
marginal. We then find that the exponent governing post-measurement order
parameter correlations, as well as the ''effective central charge'' governing
the scaling of entanglement entropy, vary continuously with the density of
measurements in space. Our work establishes new connections between the effects
of measurements on many-body quantum states and of physical defects on
low-energy equilibrium properties.

has significant applications to astronomy. Three-body configurations are often
considered stable as long the system is hierarchical; that is, the two orbital
distances are well-separated. However, instability, which is often associated
with significant energy exchange between orbits, takes time to develop.
Assuming two massive objects in a circular orbit and a test particle in an
eccentric orbit, we develop an analytical formula estimating the time it takes
for the test particle's orbital energy to change by an order of itself. We show
its consistency with results from N-body simulations. For eccentric orbits in
particular, the instability is primarily driven not by close encounters of the
test particle with one of the other bodies, but by the fundamental
susceptibility of eccentric orbits to exchange energy at their periapsis.
Motivated by recent suggestions that the galactic center may host an
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) as a companion to the massive black hole
Sgr A*, we use our timescale to explore the parameter space that could harbor
an IMBH for the lifetime of the S-cluster of stars surrounding Sgr A*.
Furthermore, we show that the orbit of an S-star can be stable for long
timescales in the presence of other orbital crossing stars, thus suggesting
that the S-cluster may be stable for the lifetimes of its member stars.

intended to deal with serial dependence such as leave-future-out (LFO),
h-block, and hv-block.
  Existing large-sample results show that both specialized and generic methods
are applicable to models of serially-dependent data. However, large sample
consistency results overlook the impact of sampling variability on accuracy in
finite samples. Moreover, the accuracy of a CV scheme depends on many aspects
of the procedure. We show that poor design choices can lead to elevated rates

autoregressions of order p with q exogenous regressors (ARX(p,q)), under the

scores computed using the joint (multivariate) density have lower variance and
better model selection accuracy than the popular pointwise estimator. In
addition, we present a detailed case study of the special case of ARX models
with fixed autoregressive structure and variance. For this class, we derive the
finite-sample distribution of the CV estimators and the model selection
statistic. We conclude with recommendations for practitioners.

creation and maintenance of functional societies, with examples of cooperative
dilemmas ranging from navigating busy road junctions to negotiating carbon

the need for socially intelligent agents that are able to navigate these
complex cooperative dilemmas is becoming increasingly evident. In the natural
world, direct punishment is an ubiquitous social mechanism that has been shown
to benefit the emergence of cooperation within populations. However no prior
work has investigated its impact on the development of cooperation within
populations of artificial learning agents experiencing social dilemmas.
Additionally, within natural populations the use of any form of punishment is
strongly coupled with the related social mechanisms of partner selection and
reputation. However, no previous work has considered the impact of combining
multiple social mechanisms on the emergence of cooperation in multi-agent
systems. Therefore, in this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of the
behaviours and learning dynamics associated with direct punishment in
multi-agent reinforcement learning systems and how it compares to third-party
punishment, when both are combined with the related social mechanisms of
partner selection and reputation. We provide an extensive and systematic
evaluation of the impact of these key mechanisms on the dynamics of the
strategies learned by agents. Finally, we discuss the implications of the use

tails of galaxies undergoing intense ram-pressure stripping in galaxy clusters,
so-called jellyfish galaxies. These clumps offer a unique opportunity to study
star formation under extreme conditions, in the absence of an underlying disk
and embedded within the hot intracluster medium. Yet, a comprehensive, high
spatial resolution study of these systems is missing. We obtained UVIS/HST data
to observe the first statistical sample of clumps in the tails and disks of six
jellyfish galaxies from the GASP survey; we used a combination of broad-band
filters and a narrow-band H{\alpha} filter. HST observations are needed to
study the sizes, stellar masses and ages of the clumps and their clustering
hierarchy. These observations will be used to study the clump scaling
relations, the universality of the star formation process and verify whether a
disk is irrelevant, as hinted by jellyfish galaxy results. This paper presents
the observations, data reduction strategy, and some general results based on
the preliminary data analysis: the UVIS high spatial resolution gives an
unprecedented sharp view of the complex structure of the inner regions of the
galaxies and of the substructures in the galaxy disks; we found clear
signatures of stripping in regions very close in projection to the galactic
disk; the star-forming regions in the stripped tails are extremely bright and
compact while we did not detect a significant number of star-forming clumps
outside those detected by MUSE. The paper finally presents the development plan

transformations that are more challenging to apply and interpret. LPA can
classify individuals into groups with similar time-use patterns. Inference on
associations of latent profiles with health outcomes need to account for the
uncertainty of the LPA classifications which is often ignored. The selection of
the most appropriate method should be guided by the scientific questions of
interest and the applicability of each model's assumptions. The analytic
results did not suggest that less time spent on SB and more in PA was
associated with better cognitive function. Further research is needed into the
health implications of the distinct 24HAC patterns identified in this cohort.

to enable adaptation to changes at the edge with online learning. However, the
parallel and distributed architectures of neuromorphic hardware based on

Plasticity (ETLP) rule that uses (1) the pre-synaptic spike trace, (2) the
post-synaptic membrane voltage and (3) a third factor in the form of projected
labels with no error calculation, that also serve as update triggers. We apply
ETLP with feedforward and recurrent spiking neural networks on visual and
auditory event-based pattern recognition, and compare it to Back-Propagation
Through Time (BPTT) and eProp. We show a competitive performance in accuracy
with a clear advantage in the computational complexity for ETLP. We also show
that when using local plasticity, threshold adaptation in spiking neurons and a
recurrent topology are necessary to learn spatio-temporal patterns with a rich
temporal structure. Finally, we provide a proof of concept hardware
implementation of ETLP on FPGA to highlight the simplicity of its computational
primitives and how they can be mapped into neuromorphic hardware for online

scheme for the numerical solution of the equations of magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) in one and two space dimensions. As shown by Godunov in 1972, the MHD
system can be written as overdetermined symmetric hyperbolic and
thermodynamically compatible (SHTC) system. More precisely, the MHD equations
are symmetric hyperbolic in the sense of Friedrichs and satisfy the first and
second principles of thermodynamics. In a more recent work on SHTC systems,
\cite{Rom1998}, the entropy density is a primary evolution variable, and total
energy conservation can be shown to be a \textit{consequence} that is obtained
after a judicious linear combination of all other evolution equations. The
objective of this paper is to mimic the SHTC framework also on the discrete
level by directly discretizing the \textit{entropy inequality}, instead of the
total energy conservation law, while total energy conservation is obtained via
an appropriate linear combination as a \textit{consequence} of the
thermodynamically compatible discretization of all other evolution equations.
As such, the proposed finite volume scheme satisfies a discrete cell entropy
inequality \textit{by construction} and can be proven to be nonlinearly stable
in the energy norm due to the discrete energy conservation. In multiple space
dimensions the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field is taken into
account via a new thermodynamically compatible generalized Lagrangian
multiplier (GLM) divergence cleaning approach. The fundamental properties of
the scheme proposed in this paper are mathematically rigorously proven. The new
method is applied to some standard MHD benchmark problems in one and two space
dimensions, obtaining good results in all cases.

micro-annuli wells is a major concern in the petroleum industry. With effective
permeability of 0.1-1.0 mD, the existence of channels in a cement annulus with
apertures of 10-300 micrometer constitutes a major threat. Squeeze cement is
typically difficult to repair channels-leakage with small apertures; hence, a
low-viscosity sealer that can be inserted into these channels while producing a
long-term resilient seal is sought. A novel application using nano-silica
sealants could be the key to seal these channels. In the construction and
sealing of hydrocarbon wells, cementing is a critical phase. Cement is prone to
cracking during the life cycle of a well because of the changes in downhole
conditions. The usage of micro-sized cross-linked nano-silica gel as a sealant
material to minimize damaged cement sheaths is investigated in this study.
Fluid leakage through channels in the cement was investigated using an
experimental system. With a diameter of 0.05 inches, the impact of the cement
channel size was explored. The sealing efficiency increased from 86 percent to
95 percent when the nano-silica concentration of the sealing gel increased from
13 percent to 25 percent. This demonstrates that the concentration of
nano-silica in the sealing gel affects the gel's ability to seal against fluid
flow. This research proposes a new way for improving cement zonal isolation and
thereby lowering the impact of cement failure in the oil and gas industry.

capable of approximating solution operators to systems of partial differential
equations through data alone. The learned FNO solution operator can be
evaluated in milliseconds, potentially enabling faster-than-real-time modeling
for predictive flow control in physical systems. Here we use FNOs to predict
how physical fluid flows evolve in time, training with particle image
velocimetry measurements depicting cylinder wakes in the subcritical vortex
shedding regime. We train separate FNOs at Reynolds numbers ranging from Re =
240 to Re = 3060 and study how increasingly turbulent flow phenomena impact
prediction accuracy. We focus here on a short prediction horizon of ten
non-dimensionalized time-steps, as would be relevant for problems of predictive
flow control. We find that FNOs are capable of accurately predicting the
evolution of experimental velocity fields throughout the range of Reynolds
numbers tested (L2 norm error < 0.1) despite being provided with limited and
imperfect flow observations. Given these results, we conclude that this method
holds significant potential for real-time predictive flow control of physical
systems.

rotating Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) using smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) with an explicit real-time integration scheme. Specifically, the
Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation was described as a complex representation to
obtain a pair of time-dependent equations, which were then solved
simultaneously following discretization based on SPH particle approximation. We
adopt the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method for time evolution. We performed
simulations of a rotating Bose gas trapped in a harmonic potential, showing
results that qualitatively agreed with previously reported experiments and
simulations. The geometric patterns of formed lattices were successfully
reproduced for several cases, for example, the hexagonal lattice observed in
the experiments of rotating BECs. Consequently, it was confirmed that the
simulation began with the periodic oscillation of the condensate, which
attenuated and maintained a stable rotation with slanted elliptical shapes;
however, the surface was excited to be unstable and generated ripples, which
grew into vortices and then penetrated the inside the condensate, forming a
lattice. We confirmed that each branch point of the phase of wavefunctions
corresponds to each vortex. These results demonstrate our approach at a certain
degree of accuracy. In conclusion, we successfully developed a new SPH scheme
for the simulations of vortex lattice formation in rotating BECs.

Several studies have approached the task as dynamic programming, e.g., integer

networks remains a challenge. Alternatively, reinforcement learning (RL) based
approaches have been proposed to optimize this task, especially to employ a
scaling action-based method which can deploy VNFs within less computational

the atmosphere. For applications involving glycerol, care must be taken to
avoid exposure to humidity, since its viscosity decreases quickly as water is
absorbed. We report experimental measurements of the viscosity of glycerol in a
parallel-plate rheometer where the outer interface is exposed to atmosphere.
The measurements decrease with time as water is absorbed from the atmosphere
and transported throughout the glycerol via diffusion and advection. Measured
viscosities drop faster at higher relative humidities, confirming the role of
hygroscopicity on the transient viscosities. The rate of viscosity decrease
shows a non-monotonic relationship with the rheometer gap height. This behavior
is explained by considering the transition from diffusion-dominated transport
in the narrow gap regime to the large gap regime where transport is dominated
by inertia-driven secondary flows. Numerical simulations of the water
absorption and transport confirm this non-monotonic behavior. The experimental
viscosity measurements show unexpectedly fast decreases at very small gap
heights, violating the parallel-plate, axisymmetric model. We propose that this
drop-off may be due to misalignment in the rheometer that becomes
non-negligible for small gaps. Theoretical considerations show that secondary
flows in a misaligned rheometer dominate the typical secondary inertial flows
in parallel-plate rheometers at small gaps. Finally, simulations in a
misaligned parallel-plate system demonstrate the same sharp drop-off in
viscosity measurements at small gap heights. This modeling can be used to
estimate the gap height where misalignment effects dominate the transient
glycerol viscosity measurements.

detection approaches have been proposed using only normal data for training,
with the aim of detecting outlier anomalous voxels at test time. Denoising
methods, for instance classical denoising autoencoders (DAEs) and more recently
emerging diffusion models, are a promising approach, however naive application
of pixelwise noise leads to poor anomaly detection performance. We show that
optimization of the spatial resolution and magnitude of the noise improves the
performance of different model training regimes, with similar noise parameter
adjustments giving good performance for both DAEs and diffusion models. Visual
inspection of the reconstructions suggests that the training noise influences
the trade-off between the extent of the detail that is reconstructed and the
extent of erasure of anomalies, both of which contribute to better anomaly
detection performance. We validate our findings on two real-world datasets
(tumor detection in brain MRI and hemorrhage/ischemia/tumor detection in brain

that a DAE trained with coarse noise is a fast and simple method that gives
state-of-the-art accuracy. Diffusion models applied to anomaly detection are as
yet in their infancy and provide a promising avenue for further research.

to a purely algebraic setting the construction of the universal $Q$-manifold of
a locally real analytic singular foliation of Lavau-C.L.-Strobl.
  Then we apply these results to study symmetries of singular foliations
through universal Lie $\infty$-algebroids. More precisely, we prove that a weak

Infiltration (CVI) in a fibrous preform. Straight, long fibers of varying
cross-sectional geometry, representing fibers of a preform, were placed within
a domain of a pre-determined size. The preparation of dense fiber-reinforced
Silicon-Carbon (SiC) composites was considered as a representative of CVI
methodology, where methyl-trichlorosilane (MTS) was used as both the silicon
and carbon donor for the silicon carbide matrix. Concentrations of MTS were
then set at the domain boundaries, and the domain was gradually infiltrated
with MTS as time progressed. The concentration of MTS at the surface of the
preform fibers was calculated using the adopted BSM. For quasi-equilibrium
considered, the reaction rate at solid surface is equal to the diffusion rate
towards the surface. The Robin or third type boundary condition, which is a
linear combination of the values of a function and the values of its derivative
on the boundary of the domain, are developed and implemented to BSM. From the
fibers surface concentrations obtained by BSM, deposition rates were
calculated, and the geometry was updated to reflect the fiber growth during the
time step, therefore, the fiber size growth and pore filling was modeled over
time. The BSM analysis was verified by comparisons to a known analytical
solution of concentric cylinders with a concentration set at the outer cylinder
and a reaction at the inner. BSM solutions were also compared to experimental
data as well as computational results obtained by a Level-Set Method (LSM).
Obtained dynamics of pore size and location will help to evaluate quality of
material manufactured by CVI. Porosity transients were obtained to show the
relation between initial and current porosities as time progresses.

that encompasses multiple Brillouin zones. Applying this approach to

regularization, of Allen-Cahn type, is introduced in the transport equation for
the deformation gradient, together with a regularizing interface term depending
on the gradient of the deformation gradient in the free energy of the system.
We study the global existence of a weak solution for the model. While standard
diffusive regularizations of the transport equation for the deformation
gradient presented in literature allows the existence study only for simplified
cases, i.e. in two space dimensions and for convex elastic free energy
densities of Neo-Hookean type which are independent from the phase field
variable, the present regularization allows to study more general cases. In
particular, we obtain the global existence of a weak solution in three space
dimensions and for generic nonlinear elastic energy densities with polynomial
growth. Our analysis considers elastic free energy densities which depend on
the phase field variable and which can possibly degenerate for some values of
the phase field variable. By means of an iterative argument based on elliptic
regularity bootstrap steps, we find the maximum allowed polynomial growths of
the Cahn-Hilliard potential and the elastic energy density which guarantee the
existence of a solution in three space dimensions. We propose two
unconditionally energy stable finite element approximations of the model, based
on convex splitting ideas and on the use of a scalar auxiliary variable,
proving the existence and stability of discrete solutions. We finally report
numerical results for different test cases with shape memory alloy type free

There have been several works to simulate optical tactile sensors that leverage

In this work, we propose a pluggable and low computational cost simulator using

deformed elastomer surfaces to be rendered into tactile images and reveals
contact information without suffering from high computational costs. Tacchi
facilitates creating realistic tactile images in simulation, e.g., ones that
capture wear-and-tear defects on object surfaces. In addition, the proposed
Tacchi can be integrated with robotics simulators for a robot system

better similarity to real images and achieved higher Sim2Real accuracy compared
to the existing methods. Moreover, it can be connected with MuJoCo and Gazebo
with only the requirement of 1G memory space in GPU compared to a computer

Current models struggle to explain the high-frequency light curves of ESEs, and
a recent analysis of a double lensing event in PSR\,B0834+06 reveals features
of ESEs that may also be challenging to accommodate via existing models. We
propose that these features arise naturally when the lens has a cusp-like
profile, described by the elementary $A_3$ cusp catastrophe. This is an
extension of previous work describing pulsar scintillation as arising from
$A_2$ fold catastrophes in thin, corrugated plasma sheets along the line of
sight. We call this framework of describing the lens potentials via elementary
catastrophes ``doubly catastrophic lensing"", as catastrophes (e.g. folds and
cusps) have long been used to describe universal features in the light curves
of lensing events that generically manifest, regardless of the precise details
of the lens. Here, we argue that the lenses themselves may be described by
these same elementary structures. If correct, the doubly catastrophic lensing
framework would provide a unified description of scintillation and ESEs, where
the lenses responsible for these scattering phenomena are universal and can be
fully described by a small number of unfolding parameters. This could enable
their application as giant cosmic lenses for precision measurements of coherent
sources, including FRBs and pulsars.

schedules the operation of switches, generators, battery energy storage

islanded microgrid for multiple days. A performance-based CLPU model is
developed to estimate additional energy needs of CLPU so that CLPU can be
formulated into the traditional 2-stage UC scheduling process. A per-phase
demand response budget term is added to the 1st stage UC objective function to
meet 3-phase load unbalance limits. To reduce computational complexity in the
1st stage UC, we replace the spanning tree method with a feasible
reconfiguration topology list method. The proposed algorithm is developed on a
modified IEEE 123-bus system and tested on the real-time simulation testbed
using actual load and PV data. Simulation results show that Microgrid-UC
successfully accounts for CLPU, phase imbalance, and feeder reconfiguration

computational microscope based on a synchronized array of 54 cameras that can
capture high-speed 3D topographic videos over a 135-cm^2 area, achieving up to
230 frames per second at throughputs exceeding 5 gigapixels (GPs) per second.
3D-RAPID features a 3D reconstruction algorithm that, for each synchronized

globally-consistent composite that includes a coregistered 3D height map. The
self-supervised 3D reconstruction algorithm itself trains a
spatiotemporally-compressed convolutional neural network (CNN) that maps raw
photometric images to 3D topography, using stereo overlap redundancy and
ray-propagation physics as the only supervision mechanism. As a result, our
end-to-end 3D reconstruction algorithm is robust to generalization errors and
scales to arbitrarily long videos from arbitrarily sized camera arrays. The
scalable hardware and software design of 3D-RAPID addresses a longstanding

(FV/FE) scheme is presented for the numerical solution of the compressible
Euler and Navier-Stokes equations at all Mach numbers on unstructured staggered
meshes in two and three space dimensions. The chosen grid arrangement consists
of a primal simplex mesh composed of triangles or tetrahedra, and an edge-based
/ face-based staggered dual mesh. The governing equations are discretized in
conservation form. The nonlinear convective terms of the equations, as well as
the viscous stress tensor and the heat flux, are discretized on the dual mesh
at the aid of an explicit local ADER finite volume scheme, while the implicit
pressure terms are discretized at the aid of a continuous $\mathbb{P}^{1}$
finite element method on the nodes of the primal mesh. In the zero Mach number
limit, the new scheme automatically reduces to the hybrid FV/FE approach
forwarded in \cite{BFTVC17} for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. As
such, the method is asymptotically consistent with the incompressible limit of
the governing equations and can therefore be applied to flows at all Mach
numbers. Due to the chosen semi-implicit discretization, the CFL restriction on
the time step is only based on the magnitude of the flow velocity and not on
the sound speed, hence the method is computationally efficient at low Mach
numbers. In the chosen discretization, the only unknown is the scalar pressure
field at the new time step. Furthermore, the resulting pressure system is
symmetric and positive definite and can therefore be very efficiently solved
with a matrix-free conjugate gradient method.
  In order to assess the capabilities of the new scheme, we show computational
results for a large set of benchmark problems that range from the quasi
incompressible low Mach number regime to compressible flows with shock waves.

finite volume schemes for overdetermined, hyperbolic and thermodynamically
compatible PDE systems. In the following we will denote these methods as HTC
schemes. In particular, we consider the Euler equations of compressible
gasdynamics, as well as the more complex Godunov-Peshkov-Romenski (GPR) model
of continuum mechanics, which, at the aid of suitable relaxation source terms,
is able to describe nonlinear elasto-plastic solids at large deformations as
well as viscous fluids as two special cases of a more general first order
hyperbolic model of continuum mechanics. The main novelty of the schemes
presented in this paper lies in the fact that we solve the \textit{entropy
inequality} as a primary evolution equation rather than the usual total energy
conservation law. Instead, total energy conservation is achieved as a mere
consequence of a thermodynamically compatible discretization of all the other
equations. For this, we first construct a discrete framework for the
compressible Euler equations that mimics the continuous framework of Godunov's
seminal paper \textit{An interesting class of quasilinear systems} of 1961
\textit{exactly} at the discrete level. All other terms in the governing
equations of the more general GPR model, including non-conservative products,
are judiciously discretized in order to achieve discrete thermodynamic
compatibility, with the exact conservation of total energy density as a direct
consequence of all the other equations. As a result, the HTC schemes proposed
in this paper are provably marginally stable in the energy norm and satisfy a
discrete entropy inequality by construction. We show some computational results
obtained with HTC schemes in one and two space dimensions, considering both the
fluid limit as well as the solid limit of the governing partial differential
equations.

strengthen limits, in particular at higher $m_\mathrm{a}$ by probing

detonation initiation are studied. Different hotspot pressure and composition
are first considered in the uniform mixture. It is found that detonation
initiation fails for low hotspot pressures and supercritical regime dominates
with high hotspot pressures. Detonation is directly initiated from the reactive
hotspot, whilst it is ignited somewhere beyond the nonreactive hotspots. Two
cell diverging patterns (i.e., abrupt and gradual) are identified and the
detailed mechanisms are analyzed. Moreover, cell coalescence occurs if many
irregular cells are generated initially, which promotes the local cell growing.
We also consider nonuniform detonable mixtures. The results show that the
initiated detonation experiences self-sustaining propagation, highly unstable
propagation, and extinction in mixtures with a linearly decreasing equivalence
ratio along the radial direction respectively, i.e., 1 to 0.9, 1 to 0.5 and 1
to 0. Moreover, the hydrodynamic structure analysis shows that, for the
self-sustaining detonations, the hydrodynamic thickness increases at the
overdriven stage, decreases as the cells are generated, and eventually become
almost constant at the cell diverging stage, within which the sonic plane shows
a sawtooth pattern. However, in the detonation extinction cases, the
hydrodynamic thickness continuously increases, and no sawtooth sonic plane can
be observed.

collecting accelerated data can reduce the acquisition time. Employing 2D
Cartesian-rectilinear subsampling schemes is a conventional approach for
accelerated acquisitions; however, this often results in imprecise
reconstructions, even with the use of Deep Learning (DL), especially at high
acceleration factors. Non-rectilinear or non-Cartesian trajectories can be
implemented in MRI scanners as alternative subsampling options. This work
investigates the impact of the $k$-space subsampling scheme on the quality of
reconstructed accelerated MRI measurements produced by trained DL models.
  Methods: The Recurrent Variational Network (RecurrentVarNet) was used as the
DL-based MRI-reconstruction architecture. Cartesian, fully-sampled multi-coil
$k$-space measurements from three datasets were retrospectively subsampled with
different accelerations using eight distinct subsampling schemes: four
Cartesian-rectilinear, two Cartesian non-rectilinear, and two non-Cartesian.
Experiments were conducted in two frameworks: scheme-specific, where a distinct
model was trained and evaluated for each dataset-subsampling scheme pair, and
multi-scheme, where for each dataset a single model was trained on data
randomly subsampled by any of the eight schemes and evaluated on data
subsampled by all schemes.
  Results: In both frameworks, RecurrentVarNets trained and evaluated on
non-rectilinearly subsampled data demonstrated superior performance,
particularly for high accelerations. In the multi-scheme setting,
reconstruction performance on rectilinearly subsampled data improved when
compared to the scheme-specific experiments.
  Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the potential for using DL-based
methods, trained on non-rectilinearly subsampled measurements, to optimize scan
time and image quality.

studied only in RD systems which do not explicitly depend on independent
variables such as space. In practise, many systems for which Turing patterning
is important are not homogeneous with ideal boundary conditions. In
heterogeneous systems with stable steady states, the steady states are also
necessarily heterogeneous which is problematic for applying the classical
analysis. Whilst there has been some work done to extend Turing analysis to
some heterogeneous systems, for many systems it is still difficult to determine
if a stable patterned state is driven purely by system heterogeneity or if a
Turing instability is playing a role. In this work, we try to define a
framework which uses numerical continuation to map heterogeneous RD systems
onto a sensible nearby homogeneous system. This framework may be used for
discussing the role of Turing instabilities in establishing patterns in
heterogeneous RD systems. We study the Schnakenberg and Gierer-Meinhardt models
with spatially heterogeneous production as test problems. It is shown that for
sufficiently large system heterogeneity (large amplitude spatial variations in
morphogen production) it is possible that Turing-patterned and base states
become coincident and therefore impossible to distinguish. Other exotic
behaviour is also shown to be possible. We also study a novel scenario in which
morphogen is produced locally at levels that could support Turing patterning
but on intervals/patches which are on the scale of classical critical domain
lengths. Without classical domain boundaries, Turing patterns are allowed to
bleed through; an effect noted by other authors. In this case, this phenomena
effectively changes the critical domain length. Indeed, we even note that this
phenomena may also effectively couple local patches together and drive
instability in this way.

correctly integrate all univariate quadratic functions, as well as univariate

results over short subsequences achieves periodic exactness on a much larger

devised by first considering stochastic blocked mean-field quadratures, which
may be useful in other contexts. By replacing pseudorandom sequences with
quasirandom sequences, over half of all multivariate quadratic basis functions
integrate exactly with only 4 function evaluations, and the exactness dimension
increases for longer subsequences. Analysis shows how these efficient integrals
characterize the dominant log-posterior contributions to mean-field variational

our construction causes particularly strong decoherence compared to more subtle

cascade-driven weight updating scheme governed by two rules: a unit i) adapts

broadcasts its weight vector to its neighbors after adapting for a predefined

We map avalanching to a statistical mechanics model, which allows us to

empirically investigate the effect of the heuristic search accuracy and the

a cumulative signal-to-noise ratio of approximately $3.8 \sigma$ using data on
angular scales $3 \leq \ell \leq 200$. For an idealized reconstructed peculiar

uncertainties, interpolation uncertainties can also play a role in Bayesian
inference, if the model's predictions can only be calculated at a limited set
of model parameters. This uncertainty originates from using an emulator to
interpolate the model's prediction across a continuous space of parameters. In
this work, we study the trade-offs between the emulator (interpolation) and

transferring unknown quantum states from one party to another distant partner.
However, in the scenarios of remote sensing, what people truly care about is
the information carried by certain parameters. The problem of multiparameter
estimation in the framework of qutrit teleportation under amplitude damping
(AD) noise is studied. Particularly, two schemes are proposed to battle against
AD noise and enhance the precision of multiparameter estimation by utilizing
weak measurement (WM) and environment-assisted measurement (EAM). For two-phase
parameters encoded in a qutrit state, the analytical formulas of the quantum
Fisher information matrix (QFIM) can be obtained. The results prove that the
scheme of EAM outperforms the WM one in the improvements of both independent
and simultaneous estimation precision. Remarkably, the EAM scheme can
completely ensure the estimation precision against the contamination by AD
noise. The reason should be attributed to the fact that EAM is carried out
after the AD noise. Thus, it extracts information from both the system and the
environment. The findings show that the techniques of WM and EAM are helpful
for remote quantum sensing and can be generalized to other qutrit-based quantum

  Kalman filtering has previously been applied to track neural model states and
parameters, particularly at the scale relevant to EEG. However, this approach
lacks a reliable method to determine the initial filter conditions and assumes
that the distribution of states remains Gaussian. This study presents an
alternative, data-driven method to track the states and parameters of neural
mass models (NMMs) from EEG recordings using deep learning techniques,
specifically an LSTM neural network.
  Approach
  An LSTM filter was trained on simulated EEG data generated by a neural mass
model using a wide range of parameters. With an appropriately customised loss
function, the LSTM filter can learn the behaviour of NMMs. As a result, it can
output the state vector and parameters of NMMs given observation data as the
input.
  Main Results
  Test results using simulated data yielded correlations with R squared of
around 0.99 and verified that the method is robust to noise and can be more
accurate than a nonlinear Kalman filter when the initial conditions of the
Kalman filter are not accurate. As an example of real-world application, the
LSTM filter was also applied to real EEG data that included epileptic seizures,
and revealed changes in connectivity strength parameters at the beginnings of
seizures.
  Significance
  Tracking the state vector and parameters of mathematical brain models is of
great importance in the area of brain modelling, monitoring, imaging and
control. This approach has no need to specify the initial state vector and
parameters, which is very difficult to do in practice because many of the
variables being estimated cannot be measured directly in physiological
experiments. This method may be applied using any neural mass model and,
therefore, provides a general, novel, efficient approach to estimate brain
model variables that are often difficult to measure.

objective and linear inequality (LI) constraints, which can be solved by
standard convex methods. For the case of imperfect CSI from the PBS, we propose
robust SLP schemes. First, with a norm-bounded CSI error model to approximate
the uncertain channels, we adopt a max-min philosophy to conservatively achieve
robust SLP constraints. Second, we use the additive quantization noise model
(AQNM) to describe the quantized PBS CSI and employ a stochastic constraint to
formulate the problem. Both robust approaches also result in a quadratic
objective with LI constraints. Simulation results show that, rather than simply
trying to eliminate the network's cross-interference, the proposed robust SLP

magnetization transfer (MT) as an inherent driver of longitudinal relaxation in
brain tissue by asserting a substantial difference between the $T_1$ relaxation

avenue towards the quantification of these relaxation processes on a
voxel-by-voxel basis in a clinical imaging setting, i.e. with a nominal
resolution of 1mm isotropic and full brain coverage in 12min. To this end, we
optimized a hybrid-state pulse sequence for mapping the parameters of an
unconstrained MT model. We scanned 4 people with relapsing-remitting multiple
sclerosis (MS) and 4 healthy controls with this pulse sequence and estimated
$T_1^f \approx 1.90$s and $T_1^s \approx 0.327$s for the free and semi-solid
spin pool of healthy WM, respectively, confirming previous reports and
questioning the commonly used assumptions $T_1^s = T_1^f$ or $T_1^s = 1$s.
Further, we estimated a fractional size of the semi-solid spin pool of $m_0^s
\approx 0.202$, which is larger than previously assumed. An analysis of $T_1^f$
in normal appearing white matter revealed statistically significant differences
between individuals with MS and controls. In conclusion, we confirm that
longitudinal spin relaxation in brain tissue is dominated by MT and that the
hybrid state facilitates a voxel-wise fit of the unconstrained MT model, which
enables the analysis of subtle neurodegeneration.

is used to adapt to the target distribution, is a more general approach to
achieving domain adaptation in the real world. However, it can be challenging
to capture the inherent structure of the target features accurately due to the
lack of supervised information on the target domain. By analyzing the
clustering performance of the target features, we show that they still contain
core features related to discriminative attributes but lack the collation of
semantic information. Inspired by this insight, we present Chaos to Order
(CtO), a novel approach for SFDA that strives to constrain semantic credibility
and propagate label information among target subpopulations. CtO divides the
target data into inner and outlier samples based on the adaptive threshold of
the learning state, customizing the learning strategy to fit the data
properties best. Specifically, inner samples are utilized for learning
intra-class structure thanks to their relatively well-clustered properties. The
low-density outlier samples are regularized by input consistency to achieve
high accuracy with respect to the ground truth labels. In CtO, by employing
different learning strategies to propagate the labels from the inner local to
outlier instances, it clusters the global samples from chaos to order. We
further adaptively regulate the neighborhood affinity of the inner samples to
constrain the local semantic credibility. In theoretical and empirical
analyses, we demonstrate that our algorithm not only propagates from inner to
outlier but also prevents local clustering from forming spurious clusters.
Empirical evidence demonstrates that CtO outperforms the state of the arts on
three public benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, and VisDA.

result in the rapid loss of atoms and low repetition rate of the experimental
sequence. Moreover, the coherence time will be sharply shortened due to the
residual thermal motion of cold atoms. These issues can be addressed by a
one-dimensional magic lattice trap, which can form a deeper potential trap than
the traveling wave optical dipole trap when the output power is limited. In
addition, these common techniques for atomic confinement generally have certain
requirements for the polarization and intensity stability of the laser. Here,
we demonstrated a method to suppress both the polarization drift and power
fluctuation only based on the phase management of the Mach-Zehnder

of three wave plates and the interferometer, we used the instrument to collect

significantly suppressed, and the noise power spectral density after
closed-loop locking with a typical bandwidth of 1-3000 Hz was significantly
lower than that under the free running of the laser system. Typically, at 1000

perturbation, the system enjoys faster decaying modes with more oscillations

field's QNM spectra with high overtones for the angular quantum numbers $l>0$.
It is that the LQG-BH has a larger real part of QNM with high overtones than
the Schwarzschild black hole (SS-BH). Such an anomalous phenomenon results in
the oscillation of the scalar field in the LQG-BH to be nearly identical to
that in the SS-BH. Therefore, the high overtone modes of the scalar field in

that can simultaneously track dynamic obstacles and represent static obstacles
based on an RGB-D camera. After inspection, the Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
pipeline is applied to generate the 3D shape of the target. To our best

the gradient-based optimization. The a posteriori performance of the VOMM model
is comprehensively examined in LES of three turbulent flows, including the
forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence, decaying homogenous isotropic

outperforms the dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM), dynamic mixed model (DMM) and

statistics, including the velocity spectrum, structure functions, statistics of

surrounded by a boundary of dual plaquettes. As the temperature is raised,
these spin clusters become more numerous, and it is found that eventually their
boundaries undergo a percolation transition when about 13\% of spins are
minority. Boundary percolation differs from the more commonly studied site and
link percolation, although it is related to an unusual type of site percolation
that includes next to nearest neighbor relationships. Because the Ising model
can be reformulated in terms of the domain boundaries alone, there is reason to
believe boundary percolation should be relevant here. A symmetry-breaking order
parameter is found in the dual theory, the 3D gauge Ising model. It is seen to
undergo a phase transition at a coupling close to that predicted by duality
from the boundary percolation. This transition lies in the disordered phase of
the gauge theory and has the nature of a spin-glass transition. Its critical
exponent $\nu \sim 1.3$ is seen to match the finite-size shift exponent of the
percolation transition further cementing their connection. This predicts a very
weak specific heat singularity with exponent $\alpha \sim -1.9$. The third
energy cumulant fits well to the expected non-infinite critical behavior in a
manner consistent with both the predicted exponent and critical point,
indicating a true thermal phase transition. Unlike random boundary percolation,
the Ising boundary percolation has two different $\nu$ exponents, one
associated with largest-cluster scaling and the other with finite-size
transition-point shift. This suggests there are two different correlation
lengths present.

packet injection attacks are still in their infancy. Furthermore, many of the
proposed solutions have been shown to be easily by-passed by simple
modifications to the attacking packets or by altering the attacking profile. In
this paper, we develop novel Graph Convolutional Neural Network models and
algorithms for grouping network nodes/users into security classes by learning
from network data. We start with two simple classes - nodes that engage in
suspicious packet injection attacks and nodes that are not. From these classes,
we then partition the network into separate segments with different security
policies using distributed Ryu controllers in an SDN network. We show in
experiments on an emulated SDN that our detection solution outperforms
alternative approaches with above 99\% detection accuracy on various types
(both old and new) of injection attacks. More importantly, our mitigation
solution maintains continuous functions of non-compromised nodes while
isolating compromised/suspicious nodes in real-time. All code and data are
publicly available for reproducibility of our results.

insertion direction. The ability to handle a variety of objects, achieve
high-speeds, and handle a wide range in object position variation are also

this paper proposes monolithic fingers with structured compliance and

applications. Recently, learning-based methods have achieved higher accuracy

sufficient depth labels for supervised training. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised framework to estimate depth from LF images. First, we design a
disparity estimation network (DispNet) with a coarse-to-fine structure to
predict disparity maps from different view combinations by performing
multi-view feature matching to learn the correspondences more effectively. As
occlusions may cause the violation of photo-consistency, we design an occlusion
prediction network (OccNet) to predict the occlusion maps, which are used as
the element-wise weights of photometric loss to solve the occlusion issue and
assist the disparity learning. With the disparity maps estimated by multiple
input combinations, we propose a disparity fusion strategy based on the
estimated errors with effective occlusion handling to obtain the final
disparity map. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance on both the dense and sparse LF images, and also has
better generalization ability to the real-world LF images.

transformable spacecrafts are expected to greatly enhance orbit and attitude
control capability due to its high redundancy in control degree of freedom if

difficulties in control, and therefore, previous researchers imposed strong
constraints to limit its potential control capabilities. This paper addresses
novel attitude control techniques for the transformable spacecrafts under SRP.
The authors have constructed two proposed methods; one of those is a joint
angle optimization to acquire arbitrary SRP force and torque, and the other is
a momentum damping control driven by joint angle actuation. Our proposed
methods are formulated in general forms and applicable to any transformable
spacecraft that has front faces that can dominantly receive SRP on each body.
Validity of the proposed methods are confirmed by numerical simulations. This
paper contributes to making most of the high control redundancy of
transformable spacecrafts without consuming any expendable propellants, which
is expected to greatly enhance orbit and attitude control capability.

A for all BP categories in the British Hypertension Society protocol. The
proposed framework performs well even when applied to a combined database of

to extend the notion of $k$-cores, which proved useful with numerous
applications for pairwise graphs, to hypergraphs. However, the previous
extensions are based on an unrealistic assumption that hyperedges are fragile,
i.e., a high-order relation becomes obsolete as soon as a single member leaves
it.
  In this work, we propose a new substructure model, called ($k$,

long as at least $t$ fraction of the members remain. Specifically, it is
defined as the maximal subhypergraph where (1) every node is contained in at

w.r.t the sum of the sizes of hyperedges. Then, we demonstrate that real-world

which capture different perspectives depending on $t$. Lastly, we show the
successful applications of our model in identifying influential nodes, dense

episodic Markov decision process (MDP) from Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
perspective. The objective is formulated theoretically as the expected returns
discounted over the time horizon. One of the major policy gradient biases is
the state distribution shift: the state distribution used to estimate the
gradients differs from the theoretical formulation in that it does not take
into account the discount factor. Existing discussion of the influence of this
bias was limited to the tabular and softmax cases in the literature. Therefore,
in this paper, we extend it to the DRL setting where the policy is
parameterized and demonstrate how this bias can lead to suboptimal policies
theoretically. We then discuss why the empirically inaccurate implementations
with shifted state distribution can still be effective. We show that, despite
such state distribution shift, the policy gradient estimation bias can be
reduced in the following three ways: 1) a small learning rate; 2) an
adaptive-learning-rate-based optimizer; and 3) KL regularization. Specifically,
we show that a smaller learning rate, or, an adaptive learning rate, such as
that used by Adam and RSMProp optimizers, makes the policy optimization robust
to the bias. We further draw connections between optimizers and the
optimization regularization to show that both the KL and the reverse KL
regularization can significantly rectify this bias. Moreover, we provide
extensive experiments on continuous control tasks to support our analysis. Our
paper sheds light on how successful PG algorithms optimize policies in the DRL
setting, and contributes insights into the practical issues in DRL.

aims at building a visual stimuli recognition system customized for the target
subject whose EEG samples are limited, by transferring knowledge from abundant
data of source subjects. Existing approaches consider the scenario that samples
of source subjects are accessible during training. However, it is often
infeasible and problematic to access personal biological data like EEG signals
due to privacy issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel and practical
problem setup, namely source-free subject adaptation, where the source subject
data are unavailable and only the pre-trained model parameters are provided for
subject adaptation. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose
classifier-based data generation to simulate EEG samples from source subjects
using classifier responses. Using the generated samples and target subject
data, we perform subject-independent feature learning to exploit the common
knowledge shared across different subjects. Notably, our framework is
generalizable and can adopt any subject-independent learning method. In the
experiments on the EEG-ImageNet40 benchmark, our model brings consistent
improvements regardless of the choice of subject-independent learning. Also,
our method shows promising performance, recording top-1 test accuracy of 74.6%
under the 5-shot setting even without relying on source data. Our code can be

dynamics of strongly coupled systems with important interdisciplinary
connections to condensed matter physics. Due to the pure Yukawa repulsive
interaction between dust particles, dusty plasmas do not display a traditional
liquid-vapor phase transition, perfectly matching the definition of a
supercritical fluid. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we verify the
supercritical nature of dusty plasmas and reveal the existence of a dynamical
liquid-like to gas-like crossover which perfectly matches the salient features
of the Frenkel line in classical supercritical fluids. We present several
diagnostics to locate this dynamical crossover spanning from local atomic
connectivity, shear relaxation dynamics, velocity autocorrelation function,
heat capacity, and various transport properties. All these different criteria
well agree with each other and are able to successfully locate the Frenkel line
in both 2D and 3D dusty plasmas. In addition, we propose the unity ratio of the
instantaneous transverse sound speed $C_T$ to the average particle speed
$\bar{v}_{p}$, i.e., $C_T / \bar{v}_{p} = 1$, as a new diagnostic to identify
this dynamical crossover. Finally, we observe an emergent degree of
universality in the collective dynamics and transport properties of dusty
plasmas as a function of the screening parameter and dimensionality of the
system. Intriguingly, the temperature of the dynamical transition is
independent of the dimensionality, and it is found to be always $20$ times of
the corresponding melting point. Our results open a new path for the study of
single particle and collective dynamics in plasmas and their interrelation with
supercritical fluids in general.

However, whether these heuristics can apply to non-grid-based problem settings

bounded-suboptimal with any desired factor. We conduct extensive experiments on

a graphical user interface to implement the airglow subtraction on a sample of

1.39$\times$10$^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, and we recommend this as a

recent years. To enable human to steer the image generation process and
customize the output, many works explore the interpretable dimensions of the
latent space in GANs. Existing methods edit the attributes of the output image
such as orientation or color scheme by varying the latent code along certain
directions. However, these methods usually require additional human annotations
for each pretrained model, and they mostly focus on editing global attributes.
In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to improve the spatial
steerability of GANs without searching for steerable directions in the latent
space or requiring extra annotations. Specifically, we design randomly sampled
Gaussian heatmaps to be encoded into the intermediate layers of generative
models as spatial inductive bias. Along with training the GAN model from
scratch, these heatmaps are being aligned with the emerging attention of the
GAN's discriminator in a self-supervised learning manner. During inference,
human users can intuitively interact with the spatial heatmaps to edit the
output image, such as varying the scene layout or moving objects in the scene.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method not only enables spatial
editing over human faces, animal faces, outdoor scenes, and complicated indoor
scenes, but also brings improvement in synthesis quality.

that the idea of hierarchical uniform sampling (Chen, SICOMP'09; Braverman et

general class of constrained clustering problems with general assignment
constraints, including capacity constraints on cluster centers, and assignment
structure constraints for data points (modeled by a convex body $\mathcal{B})$.
  Our main theorem shows that a small-sized $\epsilon$-coreset exists as long
as a complexity measure $\mathsf{Lip}(\mathcal{B})$ of the structure
constraint, and the \emph{covering exponent} $\Lambda_\epsilon(\mathcal{X})$

$\mathsf{Lip}(\mathcal{B})$ for convex body $\mathcal{B}$ is the Lipschitz

preconditioners for a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method (P-PDS).
P-PDS can efficiently solve various types of convex optimization problems
arising in signal processing and image processing. Since the appropriate
diagonal preconditioners that accelerate the convergence of P-PDS vary greatly
depending on the structure of the target optimization problem, a design method
of diagonal preconditioners for PPDS has been proposed to determine them
automatically from the problem structure. However, the existing method has two
limitations: it requires direct access to all elements of the matrices
representing the linear operators involved in the target optimization problem,
and it is element-wise preconditioning, which makes certain types of proximity
operators impossible to compute analytically. To overcome these limitations, we
establish an Operator-norm-based design method of Variable-wise Diagonal
Preconditioning (OVDP). First, the diagonal preconditioners constructed by OVDP
are defined using only the operator norm or its upper bound of the linear
operator thus eliminating the need for their explicit matrix representations.
Furthermore, since our method is variable-wise preconditioning, it keeps all
proximity operators efficiently computable. We also prove that our
preconditioners satisfy the convergence conditions of PPDS. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of our method through applications to
hyperspectral image mixed noise removal, hyperspectral unmixing, and graph

complex-valued phase shift. Our solution method relies on the roots of a cubic
polynomial associated with a hydrodynamic picture, which provides a simple
classification of all the solutions, both bounded and unbounded, while the
boundary conditions are intuitively visualized as intersections of phase space
curves. We compare solutions for open boundary conditions with those for a
barrier potential on a ring, and also show that numerically computed solutions
for smooth barriers agree qualitatively with analytical solutions for
rectangular barriers. A stability analysis of solutions based on the Bogoliubov
equations for fluctuations show that persistent instabilities are localized at
sharp boundaries, and are predicated by the relation of the mean density change

  Federated Learning","Accepted by IEEE ICC2023",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To prevent implicit privacy disclosure in sharing gradients among data owners
(DOs) under federated learning (FL), differential privacy (DP) and its variants
have become a common practice to offer formal privacy guarantees with low
overheads. However, individual DOs generally tend to inject larger DP noises
for stronger privacy provisions (which entails severe degradation of model
utility), while the curator (i.e., aggregation server) aims to minimize the
overall effect of added random noises for satisfactory model performance. To
address this conflicting goal, we propose a novel dynamic privacy pricing
(DyPP) game which allows DOs to sell individual privacy (by lowering the scale
of locally added DP noise) for differentiated economic compensations (offered
by the curator), thereby enhancing FL model utility. Considering
multi-dimensional information asymmetry among players (e.g., DO's data
distribution and privacy preference, and curator's maximum affordable payment)
as well as their varying private information in distinct FL tasks, it is hard
to directly attain the Nash equilibrium of the mixed-strategy DyPP game.
Alternatively, we devise a fast reinforcement learning algorithm with two
layers to quickly learn the optimal mixed noise-saving strategy of DOs and the
optimal mixed pricing strategy of the curator without prior knowledge of
players' private information. Experiments on real datasets validate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of faster
convergence speed and enhanced FL model utility with lower payment costs.

effective vaccines and compelling antibiotics has escalated. Thus, pneumonia
remains a disease that needs spry prevention and treatment. The widespread

research community is the lack of publicly available datasets for chest

highly imbalanced (normal examples are over sampled, while samples with ailment
are in severe minority) making the problem even more challenging. In this

fixpoint algorithm for consistent query answering which, for a given database,
naively computes a set $\Delta$ of subsets of database repairs with at most $k$
facts, where $k$ is the size of the query $q$. The algorithm runs in polynomial

correctly computes certain answers when the query $q$ falls in the polynomial

the algorithm is an under-approximation: The query is guaranteed to be certain

best effort enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) traffic for a 5G-Advanced system.
Although XR users require stringent throughput and latency performance,
operators do not lose significant additional network capacity when adding XR
users to an eMBB dominated network. For instance, adding an XR service at 45
Mbps with 10 ms packet delay budget, yields close to a 45 Mbps drop in eMBB
capacity. In an XR only network layer, we show how the capacity in number of
supported XR users depends significantly on the rate but also the latency
budget. We show also how the XR service capacity is significantly reduced in
the mixed service setting as the system goes into full load and other-cell
interference becomes significant. The presented results can be used by cellular
service providers to assess their networks performance of XR traffic based on
their current eMBB performance, or as input to dimensioning to be able to serve
certain XR traffic loads.

demonstrated the importance of embedding moral choices into intelligent agents.
They have also highlighted that defining top-down ethical constraints on AI
according to any one type of morality is extremely challenging and can pose
risks. A bottom-up learning approach may be more appropriate for studying and
developing ethical behavior in AI agents. In particular, we believe that an
interesting and insightful starting point is the analysis of emergent behavior
of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents that act according to a predefined set of
moral rewards in social dilemmas.
  In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the choices made by
intrinsically-motivated RL agents whose rewards are based on moral theories. We
aim to design reward structures that are simplified yet representative of a set
of key ethical systems. Therefore, we first define moral reward functions that
distinguish between consequence- and norm-based agents, between morality based
on societal norms or internal virtues, and between single- and mixed-virtue
(e.g., multi-objective) methodologies. Then, we evaluate our approach by
modeling repeated dyadic interactions between learning moral agents in three
iterated social dilemma games (Prisoner's Dilemma, Volunteer's Dilemma and Stag
Hunt). We analyze the impact of different types of morality on the emergence of
cooperation, defection or exploitation, and the corresponding social outcomes.
Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
moral agents in artificial and mixed human-AI societies.

observed within the JWST ERS program. Fundamental properties that may enable
the link to exoplanet formation differ amongst retrieval methods, for example
metallicity and mineral ratios.
  In this work, the formation of clouds in the atmosphere of WASP-39b is
explored to investigate how inhomogeneous cloud properties (particle sizes,
material composition, opacity) may be for this intermediately warm gaseous
exoplanet. WASP-39b's atmosphere has a comparable day-night temperature median
with sufficiently low temperatures that clouds may form globally. The presence
of clouds on WASP-39b can explain observations without resorting to a high (>
100x solar) metallicity atmosphere for a reduced vertical mixing efficiency.
The assessment of mineral ratios shows an under-depletion of S/O due to
condensation compared to C/O, Mg/O, Si/O, Fe/O ratios. Vertical patchiness due
to heterogeneous cloud composition challenges simple cloud models. An equal
mixture of silicates and metal oxides is expected to characterise the cloud
top. Further, optical properties of Fe and Mg silicates in the mid-infrared
differ significantly which will impact the interpretation of JWST observations.
We conclude that WASP-39b's atmosphere contains clouds and the underdepletion
of S/O by atmospheric condensation processes suggest the use of sulphur gas
species as a possible link to primordial element abundances. Over-simplified
cloud models do not capture the complex nature of mixed-condensate clouds in
exoplanet atmospheres. The clouds in the observable upper atmosphere of
WASP-39b are a mixture of different silicates and metal oxides. The use of
constant particles sizes and/or one-material cloud particles alone to interpret
spectra may not be sufficient to capture the full complexity available through
JWST observations.

technique to effectively separate the SMC stars from the MW stars using a wider
set of Gaia data. We aim to reduce the possible contamination from MW stars
compared to previous strategies. Methods. The new strategy is based on neural
network classifier, applied to the bulk of the Gaia DR3 data. We produce three
samples of stars flagged as SMC members, with varying levels of completeness
and purity, obtained by application of this classifier. Using different test
samples we validate these classification results and we compare them with the
results of the selection technique employed in the Gaia Collaboration papers,
which was based solely on the proper motions. Results. The contamination of MW
in each of the three SMC samples is estimated to be in the 10-40%; the ""best
case"" in this range is obtained for bright stars (G > 16), which belong to the
Vlos sub-samples, and the ""worst case"" for the full SMC sample determined by
using very stringent criteria based on StarHorse distances. A further check
based on the comparison with a nearby area with uniform sky density indicates
that the global contamination in our samples is probably close to the low end
of the range, around 10%. Conclusions. We provide three selections of SMC star
samples with different degrees of purity and completeness, for which we
estimate a low contamination level and have successfully validated using SMC RR
Lyrae, SMC Cepheids and SMC/MW StarHorse samples.

AR11890 and AR11618, both with complex photospheric magnetic field
configurations. The ARs produced several major eruptive flares while their
photospheric magnetic field exhibited primarily flux decay in AR11890 and
primarily flux emergence in AR11618. Throughout much of their evolution both
ARs featured substantial budgets of free magnetic energy and of both positive
and negative helicity. In fact, the imbalance between the signed components of
their helicity was as low as in the quiet Sun and their net helicity eventually
changed sign 14-19 hours after their last major flare. Despite such
incoherence, the eruptions occurred at times of net helicity peaks that were
co-temporal with peaks in the free magnetic energy. The losses associated with
the eruptive flares in the normalized free magnetic energy were in the range
10-60%. For the helicity, changes ranged from 25% to the removal of the entire
excess helicity of the prevailing sign, leading a roughly zero net helicity,
but with significant equal and opposite budgets of both helicity senses. The
removal of the slowly varying background component of the free energy and
helicity timeseries revealed that all eruption-related peaks of both quantities
exceeded the 2$\sigma$ levels of their detrended timeseries. There was no
eruption when only one or none of these quantities exceeded its 2$\sigma$
level. Our results indicate that differently evolving ARs may produce major
eruptive flares even when, in addition to the accumulation of significant free
magnetic energy budgets, they accumulate large amounts of both negative and
positive helicity without a strong dominance of one handedness over the other.

However, when $f_f>=30$ Hz, the interface responds only at the neutral

since an inaccurate model can bias policy learning via generating misleading
samples. However, learning an accurate model can be difficult since the policy
is continually updated and the induced distribution over visited states used
for model learning shifts accordingly. Prior methods alleviate this issue by
quantifying the uncertainty of model-generated samples. However, these methods
only quantify the uncertainty passively after the samples were generated,
rather than foreseeing the uncertainty before model trajectories fall into
those highly uncertain regions. The resulting low-quality samples can induce
unstable learning targets and hinder the optimization of the policy. Moreover,
while being learned to minimize one-step prediction errors, the model is
generally used to predict for multiple steps, leading to a mismatch between the
objectives of model learning and model usage. To this end, we propose
\emph{Plan To Predict} (P2P), an MBRL framework that treats the model rollout
process as a sequential decision making problem by reversely considering the
model as a decision maker and the current policy as the dynamics. In this way,
the model can quickly adapt to the current policy and foresee the multi-step
future uncertainty when generating trajectories. Theoretically, we show that
the performance of P2P can be guaranteed by approximately optimizing a lower
bound of the true environment return. Empirical results demonstrate that P2P
achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging benchmark tasks.

the rather surprising result that zero-forcing precoding based on the LS

number of pilots used for DL channel training is less than the number of
antennas available at the base station (BS). Although the LMMSE channel
estimate exhibits a better quality in terms of the MSE due to the exploitation
of the channel statistics, we show that in the case of contaminated channel
observations, zero-forcing based on the LMMSE is unable to eliminate the
inter-user interference in the asymptotic limit of high DL transmit powers. In

  oscillations on aerofoils","28 pages, 20 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Self-sustained low-frequency flow unsteadiness over rigid aerofoils in the
transonic regime is referred to as transonic buffet. Although the exact
physical mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unclear, it is generally
assumed to be unique to the transonic regime. This assumption is shown to be
incorrect here by performing large-eddy simulations of flow over a NACA0012
profile for a wide range of flow conditions. At zero incidence and sufficiently
high freestream Mach numbers, M, transonic buffet occurs with shock waves
present in the flow. However, self-sustained oscillations that occur at similar
frequencies are observed at lower M for which shock waves are absent and the
entire flow field remains subsonic at all times. At higher incidences, the
oscillations are sustained at progressively lower M. Oscillations were observed
for M as low as 0.3, where compressibility effects are small. A spectral proper
orthogonal decomposition shows that the spatial structure of these oscillations
(i.e., mode shapes) are essentially the same for all cases. These results
indicate that buffet on aerofoils does not necessarily require the presence of
shock waves. Furthermore, the trend seen with increasing incidence angles
suggests that transonic buffet on aerofoils and low-frequency oscillations
reported in the incompressible regime (Zaman et al., 1989, J. Fluid Mech., vol.
202, pp. 403--442) have similar origins. Thus, models which rely specifically
on shock waves to explain transonic buffet are incorrect. These insights could
be useful in understanding the origins of ``transonic"" buffet and reformulating
mitigation strategies by shifting the focus away from shock waves.

subsystem/component models that are developed by multi-disciplinary teams of

applied for the purpose of simulation and/or control, a reduced-order model for
the interconnected dynamics is needed. In the scope of this paper, we pursue
this goal by subsystem reduction to warrant modularity of the reduction
approach. Clearly, by reducing the complexity of the subsystem models, not only
the accuracy of the subsystem models is affected, but, consequently, also the
accuracy of the interconnected model. It is typically difficult to predict a
priori how the interconnected model accuracy is affected precisely by the
subsystem reduction. In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a
top-down approach which enables the translation of given accuracy requirements
of the interconnected system model to accuracy requirements at subsystem model
level, by using mathematical tools from robust performance analysis. This
allows for the independent reduction of subsystem models while guaranteeing the
desired accuracy of the interconnected model. In addition, we show how this
top-down approach can be used to significantly reduce the interconnected model

to determine a priori whether a simulation will be successful (good conformity
between stent and vessel) or not from a clinical perspective, followed by a
regression step that provides an approximated solution of the deployed stent
configuration. The latter is achieved using a non-intrusive reduced order
modelling scheme that combines the proper orthogonal decomposition algorithm
and Gaussian process regression. The workflow was validated on an idealised
intracranial artery with a saccular aneurysm and the effect of six geometrical

two-step workflow allows the classification of deployment conditions with up to
95% accuracy and real-time prediction of the stent deployed configuration with
an average prediction error never greater than the spatial resolution of 3D

of $\mathcal{T}_\delta$ is described by a pair of trees whose Peano curves are
shown to converge jointly to a multiple SLE$_8$ pair. The interface between the

table, it may in fact follow its own rules. Because of the quite small energy
gap between its valence shells (in particular the 5$f$ and 6$d$ ones) and also
the strong influence of relativistic effects on its properties, it is actually
a challenging element for theoretical chemists. In this article, we combine
experimental information, chemical arguments and standard first-principle
calculations, complemented by implicit and explicit solvation, to revisit the
stepwise complexation of aqueous protactinium(V) with sulfate and oxalate
dianionic ligands (SO$_4$$^{2-}$ and C$_2$O$_4$$^{2-}$, respectively). From a

saturate the coordination sphere of protactinium(V) to reach converged

show that it is necessary to maintain the coordination of one hydroxyl group,

complexation constants. Therefore, we predict that this hydroxyl group is
maintained in the formation of 1:1 complexes while we confirm that it is
withdrawn when coordinating three sulfate or oxalate ligands. Finally, we

strong stochastic behavior, together with relaxation effects, making it more

strategies, mostly involving the precise control of analog parameters like
compliance current during write operations and/or programming voltage

tuning the conductance of analog RRAMs. The method is based on modulating
digital pulse widths during erase operations while keeping other parameters

the horizontal temperature and solutal gradients providing competing effects to
the fluid density while allowing the existence of a conduction state. In this

that convectons persist into parameter regimes in which the primary bifurcation

contracts, because agents may themselves deploy smart contracts (side
contracts). Typically, equilibria of games are analyzed in vitro, under the
assumption that players cannot arbitrarily commit to strategies. However,
equilibria thus obtained do not hold in general in vivo, when games are
deployed on a blockchain. Being able to deploy side contracts changes
fundamental game-theoretic assumptions by inducing a meta-game wherein agents
strategize to deploy the best contracts. Not taking side contracts into account
thus fails to capture an important aspect of deploying smart contracts in
practice. A game that remains secure when the players can deploy side contracts
is said to be side contract resilient. We demonstrate the non-triviality of
side contract resilience by analyzing two smart contracts for decentralized
commerce. These contracts have the same intended functionality, but we show
that only one is side contract resilient. We then demonstrate a side contract
attack on first-price auctions, which are the transaction mechanisms used by
most major blockchains. We show that an agent may deploy a contract ensuring
their transaction is included in the next block at almost zero cost while
forcing most other agents to enter into a lottery for the remaining block
space. This benefits all the users, but is detrimental to the miners. This
might be cause for re-evaluation of the use of auctions in transaction fee
mechanisms. We show that the attack works under certain conditions that hold
with high probability from natural distributions. The attack also works against
the transaction mechanism EIP-1559. Our work highlights an issue that is
necessary to address to ensure the secure deployment of smart contracts and
suggests that other contracts already deployed on major blockchains may be

Second, the proposed method utilizes a variational autoencoder architecture to
simultaneously perform clustering in both latent and original spaces. Also, in
order to handle the bias of a single latent space, our clustering assignment
prediction considers multiple learned latent spaces at different epochs. This

reflection measurement is less consistent than physical measurement but enables
real time adjustment of processing parameters to optimize product surface
characteristics. We propose the use of machine learning to improve accuracy of
the transformation from inline laser reflection measurements to a prediction of
surface properties. In addition to accuracy, model evaluation speed is
important for fast feedback control. The ROCKET model is one of the fastest
state of the art models, however it can be sped up by utilizing a GPU. Our
contribution is to implement the model in PyTorch for fast GPU kernel
transforms and provide a soft version of the Proportion of Positive Values

prevalence rate estimated to 2.0% for people aged over 65 years. Cardinal motor
symptoms of PD such as rigidity and bradykinesia affect the muscles involved in
the handwriting process resulting in handwriting abnormalities called PD
dysgraphia. Nowadays, online handwritten signal (signal with temporal
information) acquired by the digitizing tablets is the most advanced approach
of graphomotor difficulties analysis. Although the basic kinematic features
were proved to effectively quantify the symptoms of PD dysgraphia, a recent
research identified that the theory of fractional calculus can be used to
improve the graphomotor difficulties analysis. Therefore, in this study, we
follow up on our previous research, and we aim to explore the utilization of
various approaches of fractional order derivative (FD) in the analysis of PD
dysgraphia. For this purpose, we used the repetitive loops task from the
Parkinson's disease handwriting database (PaHaW). Handwritten signals were
parametrized by the kinematic features employing three FD approximations:
Gr\""unwald-Letnikov's, Riemann-Liouville's, and Caputo's. Results of the
correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between the clinical
state and the handwriting features based on the velocity. The extracted
features by Caputo's FD approximation outperformed the rest of the analyzed FD
approaches. This was also confirmed by the results of the classification
analysis, where the best model trained by Caputo's handwriting features
resulted in a balanced accuracy of 79.73% with a sensitivity of 83.78% and a
specificity of 75.68%.

$1/f$ noise in DNNs - specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
modelled on real world dataset - by measuring the Power Spectral Density (PSD)
of different activations within the network in response to a sequential input
of natural language. This was done in analogy to the measurement of $1/f$ noise
in human brains with techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) and
functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We further examine the exponent

finding some resemblance in the variations of the exponents in the fMRI signal.

assigning counterparts between two separate datasets -- we need to describe all
possible sources of uncertainty in object position. With ever-increasing time
baselines between observations, like 2MASS in 2001 and the next generation of
surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST, Euclid, and the Nancy
Grace Roman telescope, it is crucial that we can robustly describe and model
the effects of stellar motions on source positions in photometric catalogues.
While Gaia has revolutionised astronomy with its high-precision astrometry, it
will only provide motions for ~10% of LSST sources; additionally, LSST itself
will not be able to provide high-quality motion information for sources below
its single-visit depth, and other surveys may measure no motions at all. This
leaves large numbers of objects with potentially significant positional drifts
that may incorrectly lead matching algorithms to deem two detections too far
separated on the sky to be counterparts.
  To overcome this, in this paper we describe a model for the statistical
distribution of on-sky motions of sources of given sky coordinates and
brightness, allowing for the cross-match process to take into account this
extra potential separation between Galactic sources. We further detail how to
fold these probabilistic proper motions into Bayesian cross-matching
frameworks, such as those of Wilson & Naylor. This will vastly improve the
recovery of e.g. very red objects across optical-infrared matches, and decrease
the false match rate of photometric catalogue counterpart assignment.

  Exploration",,,,,"cs.RO cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Efficient exploration strategies are vital in tasks such as search-and-rescue
missions and disaster surveying. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become
particularly popular in such applications, promising to cover large areas at
high speeds. Moreover, with the increasing maturity of onboard UAV perception,
research focus has been shifting toward higher-level reasoning for single- and
multi-robot missions. However, autonomous navigation and exploration of
previously unknown large spaces still constitutes an open challenge, especially
when the environment is cluttered and exhibits large and frequent occlusions
due to high obstacle density, as is the case of forests. Moreover, the problem
of long-distance wireless communication in such scenes can become a limiting
factor, especially when automating the navigation of a UAV swarm. In this
spirit, this work proposes an exploration strategy that enables UAVs, both
individually and in small swarms, to quickly explore complex scenes in a
decentralized fashion. By providing the decision-making capabilities to each
UAV to switch between different execution modes, the proposed strategy strikes
a great balance between cautious exploration of yet completely unknown regions
and more aggressive exploration of smaller areas of unknown space. This results
in full coverage of forest areas of variable density, consistently faster than
the state of the art. Demonstrating successful deployment with a single UAV as
well as a swarm of up to three UAVs, this work sets out the basic principles
for multi-root exploration of cluttered scenes, with up to 65% speed up in the
single UAV case and 40% increase in explored area for the same mission time in
multi-UAV setups.

braking, could exceed $10^{16}\,\mbox{G}$. This object may therefore be the
most magnetised neutron star observed to date. In this paper, a critical
analysis of a magnetar interpretation for the source is provided. (i) A minimum
polar magnetic field strength of $B \sim 5 \times 10^{15}\,\mbox{G}$ appears to
be necessary for the star to activate as a radio pulsar, based on conventional
`death valley' assumptions. (ii) Back-extrapolation from magnetic braking and
Hall-plastic-Ohm decay suggests that a large angular momentum reservoir was
available at birth to support intense field amplification. (iii) The
observational absence of X-rays constrains the star's field strength and age,
as the competition between heating from field decay and Urca cooling implies a
surface luminosity as a function of time. If the object is an isolated, young

or mitigation indispensable for quantum computation. While current
error-correcting strategies focus on correcting errors in quantum states or
quantum gates, these fine-grained error-correction methods can incur
significant overhead for quantum algorithms of increasing complexity. We
present a first step in achieving error correction at the level of quantum
algorithms by combining a unified perspective on modern quantum algorithms via
quantum signal processing (QSP). An error model of under- or over-rotation of
the signal processing operator parameterized by $\epsilon < 1$ is introduced.
It is shown that while Pauli $Z$-errors are not recoverable without additional
resources, Pauli $X$ and $Y$ errors can be arbitrarily suppressed by coherently
appending a noisy `recovery QSP.' Furthermore, it is found that a recovery QSP
of length $O(2^k c^{k^2} d)$ is sufficient to correct any length-$d$ QSP with
$c$ unique phases to $k^{th}$-order in error $\epsilon$. Allowing an additional
assumption, a lower bound of $\Omega(cd)$ is shown, which is tight for $k = 1$,
on the length of the recovery sequence. Our algorithmic-level error correction
method is applied to Grover's fixed-point search algorithm as a demonstration.

we obtain an exact formula for the joint distribution of the positions of the

to study the fluctuations around the perfect crystal, which, to leading order,

wide range of optimization problems. The Mdp model consists of sets of states,
actions, time steps, rewards, and probability transitions. When in a given
state and at a given time, the decision maker's action generates a reward and
determines the state at the next time step according to the probability
transition function. However, Mdps assume that the decision maker knows the
state of the controlled dynamical system. Hence, when one needs to optimize
controlled dynamical systems under partial observation, one often turns toward
the formalism of Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (Pomdp). Pomdps
are often untractable in the general case as Dynamic Programming suffers from
the curse of dimensionality. Instead of focusing on the general Pomdps, we
present a subclass where transitions and observations mappings are
deterministic: Deterministic Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes
(Det-Pomdp). That subclass of problems has been studied by (Littman, 1996) and
(Bonet, 2009). It was first considered as a limit case of Pomdps by Littman,
mainly used to illustrate the complexity of Pomdps when considering as few
sources of uncertainties as possible. In this paper, we improve on Littman's
complexity bounds. We then introduce and study an even simpler class: Separated
Det-Pomdps and give some new complexity bounds for this class. This new class

property, called DNI, based on {\em branching place bisimilarity}

checkable on CFM processes, as it is compositional, so that it does does not

challenges related to the growth and characterization of doping and p-n

significantly impeded their development. The problems are further amplified if
a p-n junction has to be implemented radially. Therefore, even though radial
junction devices are expected to be on par with their axial junction
counterparts, there are minimal reports on high-performance radial junction
nanowire optoelectronic devices. This paper summarizes our recent results on
the simulation and fabrication of radial junction nanowire solar cells and
photodetectors, which have shown unprecedented performance and clearly
demonstrate the importance of radial junction for optoelectronic applications.
Our simulation results show that the proposed radial junction device is both
optically and electrically optimal for solar cell and photodetector
applications, especially if the absorber quality is extremely low. The radial
junction nanowire solar cells could achieve a 17.2% efficiency, whereas the
unbiased radial junction photodetector could show sensitivity down to a single
photon level using an absorber with a lifetime of less than 50 ps. In
comparison, the axial junction planar device made using same substrate as
absorber showed less than 1% solar cell efficiency and almost no photodetection

radial junction nanowire devices over their thin film or axial junction

softer and has a smaller flux level compared to the synchrotron spectra

J090113.51+144704.6. The last one exhibits IW And-like behaviour in archival
ZTF data, and appears to have shallow, grazing eclipses. In addition, we detect
nSH signatures in two non-eclipsing systems: KQ Mon and Gaia DR3
4684361817175293440, by identifying the orbital period from the
superorbital-dependent irradiation of the secondary. We discover nSH signatures
in one more system, [PK2008] HalphaJ103959, by using an orbital period from
another work. An improved mass ratio - nSH deficit relation $q(\varepsilon_-)$
is suggested by us, which agrees with independent measurements on nova-like
variables. With this relation, we estimate the mass ratios of all systems in
our sample, and determine the orbital inclinations for the three that are
eclipsing. All systems with discovered nSHs in this work are excellent targets
for follow-up spectroscopic studies.

magnetic field is characterized by the Landau levels, which play a fundamental
role in the thermodynamic and transport properties of solids. The topological
nature and the approximate degeneracy of the Landau levels are known to also
survive on crystalline lattices with discrete translation symmetry when the
magnetic flux through a primitive cell is small compared to the flux quantum.
Here we show that the notion of Landau levels and the quantum Hall effect can
be generalized to 2d non-crystalline lattices without spatial long-range order.
Remarkably, even when the spatial correlations decay over microscopic
distances, 2d systems can exhibit a number of well-resolved Landau-like bands.
The existence of these bands imply that non-crystalline systems in magnetic
fields can support the hallmark quantum effects which have been typically
associated with crystalline solids.

attention from society. Specifically, the use of wearables to perform stress
regulation is a growing field of research. Among techniques explored, the
haptic emulation of lowered physiological signals has been suggested to be
promising. However, some discrepancies remain in empirical research focusing on
such biofeedback (BF) regarding their efficacy, and the mechanisms underlying
the effects of these wearables remains unclear. Moreover, the influence of
individual traits on the efficiency of BF has been marginally studied, while it
has been shown that personality could impact both stress and its regulation.
The aim of this study is to investigate the outcome of interactions with these
technologies from a psycho-physiological standpoint, but also to explore
whether personality may influence its efficiency when other interaction devices
are present. Participants had to play a challenging game while a lowered haptic
BF of their heart rate was induced on their wrist. Results showed variable
efficiency of the wearable among the participants: a subjective relaxation was
evident for the participants exhibiting the highest neurotic and extraverted
traits score. Our results highlight the plurality of the modes of action of
these techniques, depending on the individual and on the level of stress to
regulate. This study also suggests that tailoring these regulation methods to
individual characteristics, such as personality traits, is important to
consider, and proposes perspectives regarding the investigation of stress and
regulation systems embedded in wearables.

put an upper bound on the initial mass of PBH requiring the PBH to evaporate

The key to our approach is learning an informative, personalized embedding that

are thought to play an important role in heating the solar corona. We aim at
characterizing the barely-explored chromosphere underneath CBPs, focusing on
the related spicular activity and on the effects of small-scale magnetic flux
emergence on CBPs. We used high-resolution observations of a CBP in H$\beta$
and Fe I 617.3 nm from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) in coordination
with the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). This work presents the first
high-resolution observation of spicules imaged in H$\beta$. The spicules were
automatically detected using advanced image processing techniques, which were
applied to the Dopplergrams derived from H$\beta$. Here we report their
abundant occurrence close to the CBP ``footpoints"", and find that the
orientation of such spicules is aligned along the EUV loops, indicating that
they constitute a fundamental part of the whole CBP magnetic structure.
Spatio-temporal analysis across multiple channels indicates that there are
coronal propagating disturbances associated with the studied spicules,
producing transient EUV intensity variations of the individual CBP loops. Two
small-scale flux emergence episodes appearing below the CBP were analyzed; one
of them leading to quiet-sun Ellerman bombs and enhancing the nearby spicular
activity. This paper presents unique evidence of the tight coupling between the
lower and upper atmosphere of a CBP, thus helping to unravel the dynamic
phenomena underneath CBPs and their impact on the latter.

strain was 0.29. The gauze pressure explained 60% of the model response in
terms of the volume of tissues under strains of 0.3, while the wound deepness
explained 28%. The mattress had a significant, but low impact, whereas the
dressing local geometry had no significant impact. As expected, the wound
deepness was one of the most influential parameters. The gauze turned out to be
more significant than expected. This may be explained by the large range of
values chosen for this study. The results should be extended to more subjects,
but still suggest that the gauze is a parameter that might not be neglected.
Care should also be taken in clinical practice when using gauze that could have
either a positive or negative impact on the soft tissues' strains. This may
also depend on the wound deepness.

effective-mass approximation, while the screened electron-hole attraction is
modeled by a Rytova-Keldysh potential with a 2D electronic polarizability
$\alpha_{2{\rm D}}$. The most important parameters as spin-orbit-induced gap
$E_g$, Fermi velocity $v_F$ and $\alpha_{2{\rm D}}$ are taken from ab initio
density functional theory calculations. In addition, $\alpha_{2{\rm D}}$ is
approximated in two different ways. The relation of $E_b$ and $E_g$ is ruled by
the screening. The existence of an excitonic insulator phase with $E_b>E_g$
sensitively depends on the chosen $\alpha_{2{\rm D}}$. The values of $E_g$ and
$\alpha_{2{\rm D}}$ are strongly modified by a vertical external electric bias
$U$, which defines a transition from the topological into a trivial insulator
at $U=E_g/2$, with the exception of plumbene. Within the Dirac approximation,
but also within the effective mass description of the kinetic energy, the
treatment of screening dominates the appearance or non-appearance of an
excitonic insulator phase. Gating does not change the results: the prediction
done at zero electric field is confirmed when a vertical electric field is
applied. Finally, Many-Body perturbation theory approaches based on the Green's

soft sensor modeling in spatiotemporal industrial processes, such as vibration
displacement. First, CPINN containing NetU and NetG is proposed. NetU is used
to approximate the solutions to PDEs under study and NetG is used to regularize
the training of NetU. The two networks are integrated into a
data-physics-hybrid loss function. Then, we theoretically prove that the

Besides the theoretical aspects, we propose a hierarchical training strategy to

Secondly, NetU-RP is achieved by NetU compensated by RP, the recurrently

quantum-proof randomness extraction has also been widely studied, addressing
the security issues in the presence of a quantum adversary. In contrast with
conventional quantum-proof randomness extractors characterizing the input raw
data as min-entropy sources, we find that the input raw data generated by a
large class of trusted-device quantum random number generators can be
characterized as the so-called reverse block source. This fact enables us to
design improved extractors. Specifically, we propose two novel quantum-proof
randomness extractors for reverse block sources that realize real-time
block-wise extraction. In comparison with the general min-entropy randomness
extractors, our designs achieve a significantly higher extraction speed and a
longer output data length with the same seed length. In addition, they enjoy
the property of online algorithms, which process the raw data on the fly
without waiting for the entire input raw data to be available. These features
make our design an adequate choice for the real-time post-processing of
practical quantum random number generators. Applying our extractors to the raw
data of the fastest known quantum random number generator, we achieve a
simulated extraction speed as high as 374 Gbps.

Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (TDSCHA) in the Wigner framework, paving
the way for the efficient computation of the nuclear motion in systems with
sizable quantum and thermal anharmonic fluctuations. Besides the improved
numerical efficiency, the Wigner formalism unveils the classical limit of

  We further extend the method to account for the non-linear couplings between
phonons and photons, responsible, e.g., for a nonvanishing Raman signal in
high-symmetry Raman inactive crystals, firstly discussed by Rasetti and Fermi.
We benchmark the method in phase III of high-pressure hydrogen ab initio. The
nonlinear photon-phonon coupling reshapes the IR spectra and explains the
high-frequency shoulder of the H2 vibron observed in experiments.
  The Wigner TDSCHA is computationally cheap and derived from first principles:
it is unbiased by assumptions on the phonon-phonon and phonon-photon scattering
and does not depend on empirical parameters. Therefore, the method can be
adopted in unsupervised high-throughput calculations.

optimize long-term user engagement in recommender systems, thereby avoiding
common pitfalls such as user boredom and filter bubbles. They capture the
sequential and interactive nature of recommendations, and thus offer a
principled way to deal with long-term rewards and avoid myopic behaviors.
However, RL approaches are intractable in the slate recommendation scenario -
where a list of items is recommended at each interaction turn - due to the
combinatorial action space. In that setting, an action corresponds to a slate
that may contain any combination of items.
  While previous work has proposed well-chosen decompositions of actions so as
to ensure tractability, these rely on restrictive and sometimes unrealistic
assumptions. Instead, in this work we propose to encode slates in a continuous,
low-dimensional latent space learned by a variational auto-encoder. Then, the
RL agent selects continuous actions in this latent space, which are ultimately
decoded into the corresponding slates. By doing so, we are able to (i) relax
assumptions required by previous work, and (ii) improve the quality of the
action selection by modeling full slates instead of independent items, in
particular by enabling diversity. Our experiments performed on a wide array of
simulated environments confirm the effectiveness of our generative modeling of
slates over baselines in practical scenarios where the restrictive assumptions
underlying the baselines are lifted. Our findings suggest that representation
learning using generative models is a promising direction towards generalizable

that are formed by two massive and hot stars and produce nonthermal (NT)
radiation. The key elements of these systems are fast winds and the shocks that
they create when they collide. Binaries with nonaccreting young pulsars have
also been detected as NT emitters, again as a consequence of the wind-wind
interaction. Black holes (BHs) might produce NT radiation by this mechanism if
they accrete at super-Eddington rates. In such cases, the disk is expected to
launch a radiation-driven wind, and if this wind has an equatorial component,
it can collide with the companion star yielding a PACWB. These systems are
supercritical colliding wind binaries (SCWBs).
  Aims. We aim to characterize the particle acceleration and NT radiation
produced by the collision of winds in binary systems composed of a
superaccreting BH and an early-type star.
  Methods. We estimated the terminal velocity of the disk-driven wind by
calculating the spatial distribution of the radiation fields and their effect
on disk particles. We then found the location of the wind collision region and
calculated the timescales of energy gain and losses of relativistic particles
undergoing diffusive acceleration. With this information, we were able to
compute the associated spectral energy distribution of the radiation.
  Results. We find that the interaction of winds can produce NT emission from
radio up to tens of GeV, with luminosities in the range of $\sim
10^{33}-10^{35} \, {\rm erg \, s^{-1}}$, which for the most part are
contributed by electron synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation.
  Conclusions. We conclude that SCWBs, such as some ultraluminous X-ray sources
and some Galactic X-ray binaries, are capable of accelerating cosmic rays and
producing NT electromagnetic emission from radio to $\gamma$-rays, in addition
to the thermal components.

  spontaneous breaking","13 pages, no figures",,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Pure $R^2$ gravity was considered originally to possess only global scale
symmetry. It was later shown to have the larger restricted Weyl symmetry where
it is invariant under the Weyl transformation $g_{\mu\nu} \to \Omega^2(x)\,
g_{\mu\nu}$ when the conformal factor $\Omega(x)$ obeys the harmonic condition
$\Box \Omega(x)=0$. Restricted Weyl symmetry has an analog in gauge theory.
Under a gauge transformation $A_{\mu}\to A_{\mu} + \frac{1}{e}\partial_{\mu}
f(x)$, the gauge-fixing term $(\partial_{\mu}A^{\mu})^2$ has a residual gauge
symmetry when $\Box f=0$. In this paper, we consider scenarios where the
symmetry of pure $R^2$ gravity can be enlarged even further. In one scenario,
we add a massless scalar field to the pure $R^2$ gravity action and show that
the action becomes on-shell Weyl invariant when the equations of motion are
obeyed. We then enlarge the symmetry to a BRST symmetry where no on-shell or
restricted Weyl condition is required. The BRST transformations here are not
associated with gauge transformations (such as diffeomorphisms) but with Weyl
(local scale) transformations where the conformal factor consists of a product
of Grassmann variables. BRST invariance in this context is a generalization of
Weyl invariance that is valid in the presence of the Weyl-breaking $R^2$ term.
In contrast to the BRST invariance of gauge theories like QCD, it is not
preserved after quantization since renormalization introduces a scale (leading
to the well-known Weyl (conformal) anomaly). We show that the spontaneous
breaking of the BRST symmetry yields an Einstein action; this still has a
symmetry which is also anomalous. This is in accord with previous work that

Krasner hyperfields. In analogy with classical valuation theory for fields, we
generalise the formalism of valuation rings to describe equivalence of
valuations on hyperfields. After proving basic results and discussing several
examples, we focus on the valued hyperfields that Krasner originally defined in
1957. We find that these must have a particular additive structure which in
turns implies the existence of a valuation a'la Krasner. We note that given
such a valued hyperfield $(F,v)$, the valuation induced by its additive
structure does not have to be equivalent to $v$. We discuss the cases in which
it does.

co-evolution of two supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and the surrounding stars
in merging galaxies. In order to investigate how different stellar components
evolve during the merger, we generate evolved stellar distributions with an
initial mass function. Special schemes have also been developed to deal with
some rare but interesting events, such as tidal disruption of main sequence
stars, the plunge of low mass stars, white dwarfs, neutron stars and stellar
mass black holes, and the partial tidal disruption of red giants or asymptotic
giant branch stars. Our results indicate that the formation of a bound
supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) will enhance the capture rates of
stellar objects by the SMBHs. Compared to the equal stellar mass model, the
multi-mass model tends to result in a higher average mass of disrupted stars.
Instead of being tidally disrupted by the SMBH, roughly half of the captured
main sequence stars will directly plunge into the SMBH because of their small
stellar radius. Giant stars, on the other hand, can be stripped of their
envelopes if they are close enough to the SMBH. Though most remnants of the
giant stars can survive after the disruption, a small fraction still could
plunge into the SMBH quickly or after many orbital periods. Our results also
indicate significant mass segregation of compact stars at the beginning of the
merger, and then this effect is destroyed as the two SMBHs form a bound binary.

perturbativity and oblique parameters are incorporated as well as constraints
from meson-antimeson mixing, radiative B-decays and the diphoton Higgs decay
rate. We also consider bounds from searches for heavy neutral and charged
scalars at the LHC. Since the Standard Model Higgs couplings match predictions
very well, we focus on the alignment limit of the model. It is shown that for a
wide range of parameters, the lightest additional scalar, pseudoscalar and
charged scalar can have substantial decays into electrons and muons (in
contrast to the usual leptonic decays into taus). An interesting signature in
the neutral sector would be the production, through vector boson fusion, of a
pair of scalars, each of which decays into an electron or muon pair.

the transmitter and the receiver. For long-distance communication, many
research projects have been conducted towards using a network composed of
high-altitude platforms (HAPs) flying at an elevation of 20 km to carry
intermediate FSO transceivers that forward data between ground stations. The
clear environment at high elevations prevents terrestrial obstacles from
cutting the LoS between the transceivers. An FSO transceiver on a HAP can
communicate with ground stations within a small area owing to its limited beam
size. We suggest using multiple FSO transceivers on a HAP to extend its ground
coverage. However, the use of too many FSO transceivers may quickly exhaust the
onboard energy of the HAP. As a result, HAP must be lowered to recharge
frequently. In this study, we first propose a configuration of multiple FSO
transceivers to widen the ground coverage of a HAP. We then propose a set of
closed-form expressions to calculate the extended coverage. Finally, to
implement a HAP network using multiple FSO transceivers, we seek the optimal
configuration of multiple FSO transceivers that minimizes the total cost of the
HAP network, including amortization, energy, and maintenance costs. The
simulation results show that the proposed multiple FSO transceiver
configuration clearly increases the ground coverage of a HAP and significantly
reduces the cost of the HAP network.

While deep learning approaches outperform conventional estimation techniques on
tasks with abundant training data, the continuously evolving pandemic poses a
significant challenge to solving this problem due to data nonstationarity,
limited observations, and complex social contexts. Prior works on mobility
estimation either focus on a single city or lack the ability to model the
spatio-temporal dependencies across cities and time periods. To address these
issues, we make the first attempt to tackle the cross-city human mobility
estimation problem through a deep meta-generative framework. We propose a
Spatio-Temporal Meta-Generative Adversarial Network (STORM-GAN) model that
estimates dynamic human mobility responses under a set of social and policy
conditions related to COVID-19. Facilitated by a novel spatio-temporal
task-based graph (STTG) embedding, STORM-GAN is capable of learning shared
knowledge from a spatio-temporal distribution of estimation tasks and quickly
adapting to new cities and time periods with limited training samples. The STTG
embedding component is designed to capture the similarities among cities to
mitigate cross-task heterogeneity. Experimental results on real-world data show
that the proposed approach can greatly improve estimation performance and
out-perform baselines.

a grazing incidence X-ray telescope with focal distance limited to 50 cm. The
effective area shall be in the range 25 to 50 cm2 for photon energies in the
range 0.2-10 keV, requiring nesting of several mirrors in the Wolter-1
geometry. Grazing incidence angles will be very small, below 2 deg. The current
target FOV is 0.25 deg. The pulsars photon arrivals are detected with a single
pixel Silicon Drift Detector (SDD) sensor with timing accuracy below 1usec. The
unit has no gimbaling to meet the applicable power, size and mass requirements.
Instead, the host spacecraft shall slew and point to allow pulsar observation.
The avionics architecture is based on a radiation hardened LEON4 processor, to
allow a synchronous propagation task and measurement generation and orbit
determination step in an asynchronous task. PODIUM will enable higher autonomy
and lower cost for interplanetary missions. L2 space observatories and
planetary flybys are the current reference use cases. Onboard autonomous state
estimation can reduce the ground support effort required for navigation and
orbit correction/maintenance computation, and reduce the turnaround time, thus
enabling more accurate maneuvers, reducing the orbit maintenance mass budget.

limitations do not exist only for those nonlinear dynamical systems that can be
converted into linear ones. The obtained results are applied to selected
population dynamics models for which non-standard Lagrangians and their
corresponding null Lagrangians and gauge functions are derived, and their roles

  Networks","AAAI-23",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Low-rank compression is an important model compression strategy for obtaining
compact neural network models. In general, because the rank values directly
determine the model complexity and model accuracy, proper selection of
layer-wise rank is very critical and desired. To date, though many low-rank
compression approaches, either selecting the ranks in a manual or automatic
way, have been proposed, they suffer from costly manual trials or unsatisfied
compression performance. In addition, all of the existing works are not
designed in a hardware-aware way, limiting the practical performance of the
compressed models on real-world hardware platforms.
  To address these challenges, in this paper we propose HALOC, a hardware-aware
automatic low-rank compression framework. By interpreting automatic rank
selection from an architecture search perspective, we develop an end-to-end
solution to determine the suitable layer-wise ranks in a differentiable and
hardware-aware way. We further propose design principles and mitigation
strategy to efficiently explore the rank space and reduce the potential
interference problem.
  Experimental results on different datasets and hardware platforms demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach. On CIFAR-10 dataset, HALOC enables
0.07% and 0.38% accuracy increase over the uncompressed ResNet-20 and VGG-16
models with 72.20% and 86.44% fewer FLOPs, respectively. On ImageNet dataset,
HALOC achieves 0.9% higher top-1 accuracy than the original ResNet-18 model
with 66.16% fewer FLOPs. HALOC also shows 0.66% higher top-1 accuracy increase
than the state-of-the-art automatic low-rank compression solution with fewer
computational and memory costs. In addition, HALOC demonstrates the practical
speedups on different hardware platforms, verified by the measurement results
on desktop GPU, embedded GPU and ASIC accelerator.

other photonic components in a compact and robustly aligned format -- that is,
on a single chip. Such PICs could offer superior scalability for complex
functionalities and volume production, as well as improved stability and
reliability over time. However, there are two major issues preventing the
realization of such envisioned PICs: the high phase noise of semiconductor
lasers, and the difficulty of integrating optical isolators directly on chip.
PICs are still considered as inferior solutions in optical systems such as
microwave synthesizers, optical gyroscopes and atomic clocks, despite their
advantages in size, weight, power consumption and cost (SWaPC). Here, we
challenge this convention by introducing three-dimensional (3D) integration in
silicon photonics that results in ultra-low-noise, isolator-free PICs. Through
multiple monolithic and heterogeneous processing sequences, direct on-chip
integration of III-V gain and ultra-low-loss (ULL) silicon nitride (SiN)

the demonstrated PIC enters a new regime, such that an integrated ultra-high-Q

cavity acts as an effective block for any downstream on-chip or off-chip
reflection-induced destabilization, thus eliminating the need for optical

machine learning applications that are developed and applied to Football Event

probabilistic valuation is outputted using Logistic Regression and Gradient
Boosting based approaches. The model successfully predicts xGs probability
values for football players based on 15,575 shots. The proposed solution
utilises StatsBomb as the data provider and an industry benchmark to tune the

to tackle the age-old cliche of: 'the ball has fallen to the wrong guy there'.
The development of the model is used to adjust and gain more realistic values
of expected goals than the general models show. To achieve this, this paper
tackles Positional Adjusted xG, splitting the training data into Forward,
Midfield, and Defence with the aim of providing insight into player qualities

aim of proving that Messi is statistically at a higher efficiency level than

quantify his qualities in comparison to the average xG models finding that
Messi xG performs 347 xG higher than the general model outcome.

couples electrochemical reactions with mechanical deformation and damage in

diffusion/migration and concurrent electrochemical reaction at damaged sites
within the host, where ionic species are reduced to form a new compound. The
theory is fully-coupled with electrodeposition impacting mechanical
deformation, stress generation and damage of the host. Conversely,
electrodeposition kinetics are affected by mechanical stresses via a
thermodynamically-consistent, physically motivated driving force that
distinguishes chemical, electrical and mechanical contributions. The theory
also captures the interplay between growth-induced fracture of the host and
deposition of a new material inside cracks by tracking damage and extent of
electrodeposition via separate phase-field variables.
  While the framework is general in nature, we specialize it to model a

intergranular and transgranular crack and Li-filament growth mechanisms, which
have been experimentally observed. In addition, we elucidate how mechanical

demonstrate quantitatively that saliency methods such as Smoothgrads or PRP
provide more faithful image patches. We also propose a new relevance metric
based on the segmentation of the object provided in some datasets (e.g.
CUB-200-2011) and show that the imprecise patch visualisations generated by
ProtoPNet and ProtoTree can create a false sense of bias that can be mitigated
by the use of more faithful methods. Finally, we discuss the implications of
our findings for other prototype-based models sharing the same visualisation
method.

Corless and Mair Zamir","Elliptic cross sections in blood flow regulation","31 pages, 17 figures",,,,"q-bio.TO cs.NA math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Arterial deformations arise in blood flow when surrounding tissue invades the
space available for a blood vessel to maintain its circular cross section, the
most immediate effects being a reduction in blood flow and redistribution of
shear stress. Here we consider deformations from circular to elliptic cross
sections. Solution of this problem in steady flow is fairly straightforward.
The focus in the present paper is on pulsatile flow where the change from
circular to elliptic cross sections is associated with a transition in the
character of the equations governing the flow from Bessel to Mathieu equations.
The study of this problem has been hampered in the past because of difficulties
involved in the solution of the governing equations. In the present study we
describe methods we have used to overcome some of these difficulties and
present a comprehensive set of results based on these methods. In particular,
vessel deformation is examined under two different conditions relevant to blood
flow regulation: (i) keeping cross sectional area constant and (ii) keeping
cross sectional circumference constant. The results provide an important
context for the mechanism of neurovascular control of blood flow under the
pathological conditions of vessel deformation.

  Feedback","IEEE ICC 2023 Conference",,,,"cs.NI cs.IT cs.LG eess.SP math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The recent advances in machine learning and deep neural networks have made
them attractive candidates for wireless communications functions such as
channel estimation, decoding, and downlink channel state information (CSI)
compression. However, most of these neural networks are large and inefficient
making it a barrier for deployment in practical wireless systems that require
low-latency and low memory footprints for individual network functions. To
mitigate these limitations, we propose accelerated and compressed efficient
neural networks for massive MIMO CSI feedback. Specifically, we have thoroughly
investigated the adoption of network pruning, post-training dynamic range
quantization, and weight clustering to optimize CSI feedback compression for
massive MIMO systems. Furthermore, we have deployed the proposed model
compression techniques on commodity hardware and demonstrated that in order to
achieve inference gains, specialized libraries that accelerate computations for
sparse neural networks are required. Our findings indicate that there is
remarkable value in applying these model compression techniques and the
proposed joint pruning and quantization approach reduced model size by 86.5%
and inference time by 76.2% with minimal impact to model accuracy. These
compression methods are crucial to pave the way for practical adoption and
deployments of deep learning-based techniques in commercial wireless systems.

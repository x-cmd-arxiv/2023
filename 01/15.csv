in recent years as companies around the world begin to position the so-called
""metaverse"" as the next major medium for accessing and interacting with the
internet. While consumers have become accustomed to a degree of data harvesting
on the web, the real-time nature of data sharing in the metaverse indicates
that privacy concerns are likely to be even more prevalent in the new ""Web
3.0."" Research into VR privacy has demonstrated that a plethora of sensitive
personal information is observable by various would-be adversaries from just a
few minutes of telemetry data. On the other hand, we have yet to see VR
parallels for many privacy-preserving tools aimed at mitigating threats on
conventional platforms. This paper aims to systematize knowledge on the
landscape of VR privacy threats and countermeasures by proposing a
comprehensive taxonomy of data attributes, protections, and adversaries based
on the study of 68 collected publications. We complement our qualitative
discussion with a statistical analysis of the risk associated with various data
sources inherent to VR in consideration of the known attacks and defenses. By
focusing on highlighting the clear outstanding opportunities, we hope to
motivate and guide further research into this increasingly important field.

realization of Landau lasers tunable over the terahertz frequency range. The
hope was that the non-equidistance of the Landau levels from Dirac fermions
would suppress the harmful non-radiative Auger recombination. Unfortunately,
even with this non-equidistance an unfavorable non-radiative process persists
in Landau-quantized graphene, and so far no cyclotron emission from Dirac

process is to sufficiently modify the dispersion of the Landau levels by
opening a small gap in the linear band structure. A proven example of such
gapped graphene-like materials are HgTe quantum wells close to the topological
phase transition. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate Landau emission
from Dirac fermions in such HgTe quantum wells, where the emission is tunable
by both the magnetic field and the carrier concentration. Consequently, these
results represent an advance in the realization of terahertz Landau lasers
tunable by magnetic field and gate-voltage.

conventional batteries with liquid electrolytes in many applications. However,
they are not yet feasible for many relevant applications. One particular
question of interest is the identification of physical effects inside
all-solid-state batteries and their quantitative influence on the performance
of the entire battery cell. Simulation models can contribute to answering the
aforementioned question by systematical studies, e.g. enabling or disabling
certain physical effects. Especially the influence of space-charge layers
(SCLs) is heavily discussed in the scientific community. So far, the different
length scales of SCLs and the microstructure of a battery cell made a spatial
discretization of realistic microstructures with resolved SCLs infeasible.
However, thermodynamically consistent continuum models which are applied to
simplified geometries are already established in the literature. In this work,
we propose a model that enables the prediction of the spatial development of
SCLs within geometrically resolved microstructures by exploiting that effects
in SCLs are predominantly one-dimensional. With the proposed approach it is
possible to quantify the geometric influence of realistic microstructures on
the formation process of SCLs. SCLs in realistic microstructures remarkably
differ from SCLs computed with simplified one-dimensional models which are
already established in the literature.

W1-W2, W1-W3 colors versus mass-to-light ratio (sensitive to a variety of
galaxy types from passive to star-forming). For each galaxy in the sample, we
then derive the combined stellar mass from these scaling relations, producing
Mstellar estimates with better than $\sim$25-30% accuracy for galaxies with

understanding the impact of biases on the news sources that people rely on for
information. Biased news can have significant and far-reaching consequences,
influencing our perspectives and shaping the decisions we make, potentially
endangering the public and individual well-being. With the advent of the
Internet and social media, discussions have moved online, making it easier to
disseminate both accurate and inaccurate information. To combat mis- and
dis-information, many have begun to evaluate the reliability of news sources,
but these assessments often only examine the validity of the news (narrative
bias) and neglect other types of biases, such as the deliberate selection of
events to favor certain perspectives (selection bias). This paper aims to
investigate these biases in various news sources and their correlation with
third-party evaluations of reliability, engagement, and online audiences. Using
machine learning to classify content, we build a six-year dataset on the
Italian vaccine debate and adopt a Bayesian latent space model to identify
narrative and selection biases. Our results show that the source classification
provided by third-party organizations closely follows the narrative bias
dimension, while it is much less accurate in identifying the selection bias.
Moreover, we found a nonlinear relationship between biases and engagement, with
higher engagement for extreme positions. Lastly, analysis of news consumption
on Twitter reveals common audiences among news outlets with similar ideological
positions.

the fundamental integrable $G_2$ vertex model. The model $R$-matrix and
respective spin chain are presented in terms of the basis generators of the
$G_2$ Lie algebra. This formulation permits us to related the number of the
Bethe roots of the respective Bethe equations with the eigenvalues of the
$U(1)$ conserved charges from the Cartan subalgebra of $G_2$. The Bethe
equations are solved by a peculiar string structure which combines complex
three-strings with real roots allowing us determine the bulk properties in the
thermodynamic limit. We argue that $G_2$ spin chain is gapless but the
low-lying excitations have two different speeds of sound and the underlying
continuum limit is therefore not strictly Lorentz invariant. We have
investigate the finite-size corrections to the ground state energy and proposed
that the critical properties of the system should be governed by the product of
two $c=1$ conformal field theories. By combining numerical and analytical
methods we have computed the bulk free-energy of the $G_2$ vertex model. We
found that there are three regimes in the spectral parameter in which the
free-energy is limited and continuous. There exists however at least two sharp
corner points in which the bulk-free energy is not differentiable.

public attention to science-intensive data profiling. This type of profiling
aims to extract complex patterns (primitives) such as functional dependencies,
data constraints, association rules, and others. However, these tools are
research prototypes rather than production-ready systems.
  The following work presents Desbordante - a high-performance
science-intensive data profiler with open source code. Unlike similar systems,
it is built with emphasis on industrial application in a multi-user
environment. It is efficient, resilient to crashes, and scalable. Its
efficiency is ensured by implementing discovery algorithms in C++, resilience
is achieved by extensive use of containerization, and scalability is based on
replication of containers.
  Desbordante aims to open industrial-grade primitive discovery to a broader
public, focusing on domain experts who are not IT professionals. Aside from the
discovery of various primitives, Desbordante offers primitive validation, which
not only reports whether a given instance of primitive holds or not, but also
points out what prevents it from holding via the use of special screens. Next,
Desbordante supports pipelines - ready-to-use functionality implemented using
the discovered primitives, for example, typo detection. We provide built-in
pipelines, and the users can construct their own via provided Python bindings.
Unlike other profilers, Desbordante works not only with tabular data, but with
graph and transactional data as well.
  In this paper, we present Desbordante, the vision behind it and its
use-cases. To provide a more in-depth perspective, we discuss its current
state, architecture, and design decisions it is built on. Additionally, we

distillation of molecular factors taking place on the surface of their lipid
membranes. To understand the properties of this molecular sorting process, a
physical model of the process has been recently proposed [arXiv:1811.06760],
based on (a) the phase separation of a single, initially dispersed molecular
species into spatially localized sorting domains on the lipid membrane, and (b)
domain-induced membrane bending leading to the nucleation of submicrometric
lipid vesicles, naturally enriched in the molecules of the engulfed sorting
domain. The analysis of the model has shown the existence of an optimal region
of the parameter space where sorting is most efficient. Here, the model is
extended to account for the simultaneous distillation of a pool of distinct
molecular species. We find that the mean time spent by sorted molecules on the
membrane increases with the heterogeneity of the pool (i.e., the number of
distinct molecular species sorted) according to a simple scaling law, and that
a large number of distinct molecular species can in principle be sorted in
parallel on a typical cell membrane region without significantly interfering
with each other. Moreover, sorting is found to be most efficient when the
distinct molecular species have comparable homotypic affinities. We also
consider how valence (i.e., the average number of interacting neighbors of a
molecule in a sorting domain) affects the sorting process, finding that
higher-valence molecules can be sorted with greater efficiency than
lower-valence molecules.

which relies on uncertainty as part of its decision-making process when
deciding which experiment to perform next. However, not much work has addressed
the effect of uncertainty on the performance of the BO algorithm and to what
extent calibrated uncertainties improve the ability to find the global optimum.
In this work, we provide an extensive study of the relationship between the BO
performance (regret) and uncertainty calibration for popular surrogate models
and compare them across both synthetic and real-world experiments. Our results
confirm that Gaussian Processes are strong surrogate models and that they tend
to outperform other popular models. Our results further show a positive
association between calibration error and regret, but interestingly, this
association disappears when we control for the type of model in the analysis.
We also studied the effect of re-calibration and demonstrate that it generally
does not lead to improved regret. Finally, we provide theoretical justification
for why uncertainty calibration might be difficult to combine with BO due to
the small sample sizes commonly used.

analysis, design, and optimization of a diverse array of electrochemical and
electrokinetic devices. These systems are represented by the
Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations coupled with the Navier-Stokes (NS)
equation. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) to accurately capture the
spatio-temporal variation of ion concentration and current flux remains
challenging due to the (a) small critical dimension of the electric double
layer (EDL), (b) stiff coupling, large advective effects, and steep gradients
close to boundaries, and (c) complex geometries exhibited by electrochemical
devices.
  In the current study, we address these challenges by presenting a direct
numerical simulation framework that incorporates: (a) a variational multiscale
(VMS) treatment, (b) a block-iterative strategy in conjunction with
semi-implicit (for NS) and implicit (for PNP) time integrators, and (c) octree
based adaptive mesh refinement. The VMS formulation provides numerical
stabilization critical for capturing the electro-convective instabilities often
observed in engineered devices. The block-iterative strategy decouples the
difficulty of non-linear coupling between the NS and PNP equations and allows
using tailored numerical schemes separately for NS and PNP equations. The
carefully designed second-order, hybrid implicit methods circumvent the harsh
timestep requirements of explicit time steppers, thus enabling simulations over
longer time horizons. Finally, the octree-based meshing allows efficient and
targeted spatial resolution of the EDL. These features are incorporated into a
massively parallel computational framework, enabling the simulation of
realistic engineering electrochemical devices. The numerical framework is
illustrated using several challenging canonical examples.

  Society A",,,,"nlin.PS math.AP math.DS nlin.AO q-bio.CB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Originating from the pioneering study of Alan Turing, the bifurcation
analysis predicting spatial pattern formation from a spatially uniform state
for diffusing morphogens or chemical species that interact through nonlinear
reactions is a central problem in many chemical and biological systems. From a
mathematical viewpoint, one key challenge with this theory for two component
systems is that stable spatial patterns can typically only occur from a
spatially uniform state when a slowly diffusing ""activator"" species reacts with
a much faster diffusing ""inhibitor"" species. However, from a modeling
perspective, this large diffusivity ratio requirement for pattern formation is
often unrealistic in biological settings since different molecules tend to
diffuse with similar rates in extracellular spaces. As a result, one key
long-standing question is how to robustly obtain pattern formation in the
biologically realistic case where the time scales for diffusion of the
interacting species are comparable. For a coupled 1-D bulk-compartment
theoretical model, we investigate the emergence of spatial patterns for the
scenario where two bulk diffusing species with comparable diffusivities are
coupled to nonlinear reactions that occur only in localized ""compartments"",
such as on the boundaries of a 1-D domain. The exchange between the bulk medium
and the spatially localized compartments is modeled by a Robin boundary
condition with certain binding rates. As regulated by these binding rates, we
show for various specific nonlinearities that our 1-D coupled PDE-ODE model
admits symmetry-breaking bifurcations, leading to linearly stable asymmetric
steady-state patterns, even when the bulk diffusing species have equal
diffusivities. Depending on the form of the nonlinear kinetics, oscillatory
instabilities can also be triggered. Moreover, the analysis is extended to
treat a periodic chain of compartments.

HI detection in emission from an individual galaxy to date. The emission is
strongly boosted by the gravitational lens, an early type elliptical galaxy, at
redshift $z \sim 0.13$. The measured HI mass of the galaxy is $\rm M_{HI} =
(0.90 \pm 0.14 \pm 0.05) \times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$, which is almost twice the
inferred stellar mass of the galaxy, indicating an extended structure of the HI
gas inside the galaxy. By fitting two-dimensional Gaussian to the HI signal at
the peak of the spectral line, we find the source to be marginally resolved
with the position angle consistent with the emission being tangential to the
critical curve of the lens mass distribution. This indicates that the solid
angle of the approaching HI line flux comes very close to the inner lens
caustic and results in very high magnification. These results, for the first

be conjugate to those of the $\mathcal O(1)$ transformations (abelian algebra

transformations. Because of this structure, one can decouple the
angle-dependent $u(1)$ asymptotic symmetry from the Poincar\'e algebra, just as
in the case of gravity: the generators of these internal transformations are
Lorentz scalars in the redefined algebra. This implies in particular that one
can give a definition of the angular momentum which is free from $u(1)$ gauge
ambiguities. The change of generators that brings the asymptotic symmetry

  monatomic supercooled liquids",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Understanding the physics of supercooled liquids near glassy transition
remains one of the major challenges in condensed matter science. There has been
long recognized that supercooled liquids have spatially dynamical heterogeneity
whose dynamics in some regions of the sample could potentially be orders of
magnitude faster than the dynamics in other regions only a few nanometers away.
However, to identify such domain structures both structurally and
configurationally in a consistent fashion and the connection between structures
and dynamics remains elusive. A new approach to classify these spatial
heterogeneities of supercooled liquids is developed. Using average weighted
coordination numbers (WCNs) of particles as features for the Principle
Component Analysis (PCA) and Gaussian Mixture (GM) clustering, a representation
of the feature space to perform GM clustering is constructed after applying PCA
to WCNs. Nano-domains or aggregated clusters are found in configurational
(real) space by direct mapping the identities of clusters in the feature
(structural) space with some classification uncertainties. These uncertainties
can be improved by a co-learning strategy to transmit information between the
structural space and configurational space iteratively until convergence. The
domains are indeed found to be remarkably consistent in both spaces over long
times as well as measured to have heterogeneous dynamics. Using such a
classification scheme the order parameter time correlation function follows the
non-conserved order parameter scaling law, which indicates that such domains
are the result of liquid-liquid phase separation after quenching.

designed to document cystoscopy in a standardized manner with three major
sections: data management, annotation management, and utilization management. A
Swiss-cheese model was proposed for quality control and root cause analyses. We
defined the infrastructure required to implement the framework with respect to
FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, re-usable) principles. We applied
two scenarios exemplifying data sharing for research and educational projects
to ensure the compliance with FAIR principles. Results: The framework was
successfully implemented while following FAIR principles. The cystoscopy atlas

limit in Gaussian means of the products of trace of N x N Hermitian matrices,
which provides one-stroke graphs of a knot. The Seifert surfaces of knots and

the $B$ type phase, the $\mathscr{PT}$- symmetry remains unbroken and it

contains a $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry broken sector comprised of eigenstates with
only complex energies and a sector of unbroken $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry with
eigenstates of real energies. The $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetry broken sector
consists of pairs of eigenstates whose energies are complex conjugates of each

the exponentially localized bound states at the edges with complex energies
which are described by boundary strings. We find that both $A$ and $B$ type

states. We also compute the bound state wavefunction in one magnon sector and
find that as the imaginary value of the boundary parameter is increased, the
exponentially localized wavefunction broadens thereby protruding more into the

in chemical and biological fields. Here we propose a scheme for
enantio-conversion of chiral mixtures via optical pumping based on a four-level
model of chiral molecules composed of two chiral ground states and two achiral
excited states, in which there exists a tunneling interaction between the
chiral states. By eliminating one of the achiral excited states in the case of
large detuning and well designing the detuning and coupling strengths of the
electromagnetic fields, the induced indirect tunneling interaction between the
chiral ground states can be cancelled with the direct tunneling interaction,
and the induced indirect interaction between the left-handed chiral state and
the remained achiral excited state can be cancelled with the direct one between
them. Hence, the left-handed ground state is unchanged and the right-handed one
can be excited to an achiral excited state, i.e., establishing
chiral-state-selective excitations. By numerically calculating the populations
of two chiral ground states, we find that the high enantiomeric excess can be
achieved with almost only the left-handed ground state being populated. That
means the high-efficiency enantio-conversion of chiral mixtures is realized
under the combining effect of the system dissipation and the
chiral-state-selective excitations.

applications, such as in legal or medical domains. One form of explanation for
a prediction is an extractive rationale, i.e., a subset of features of an
instance that lead the model to give its prediction on that instance. For
example, the subphrase ``he stole the mobile phone'' can be an extractive
rationale for the prediction of ``Theft''. Previous works on generating
extractive rationales usually employ a two-phase model: a selector that selects
the most important features (i.e., the rationale) followed by a predictor that
makes the prediction based exclusively on the selected features. One
disadvantage of these works is that the main signal for learning to select
features comes from the comparison of the answers given by the predictor to the
ground-truth answers. In this work, we propose to squeeze more information from
the predictor via an information calibration method. More precisely, we train
two models jointly: one is a typical neural model that solves the task at hand
in an accurate but black-box manner, and the other is a selector-predictor
model that additionally produces a rationale for its prediction. The first
model is used as a guide for the second model. We use an adversarial technique
to calibrate the information extracted by the two models such that the
difference between them is an indicator of the missed or over-selected
features. In addition, for natural language tasks, we propose a
language-model-based regularizer to encourage the extraction of fluent
rationales. Experimental results on a sentiment analysis task, a hate speech

Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods suffer from severe performance

paper, we empirically analyze Pseudo-Labeling (PL) in class-mismatched SSL. PL
is a simple and representative SSL method that transforms SSL problems into
supervised learning by creating pseudo-labels for unlabeled data according to
the model's prediction. We aim to answer two main questions: (1) How do OOD

show that the major problem of PL is imbalanced pseudo-labels on OOD data.
Second, we find that OOD data can help classify In-Distribution (ID) data given
their OOD ground truth labels. Based on the findings, we propose to improve PL
in class-mismatched SSL with two components -- Re-balanced Pseudo-Labeling
(RPL) and Semantic Exploration Clustering (SEC). RPL re-balances pseudo-labels
of high-confidence data, which simultaneously filters out OOD data and
addresses the imbalance problem. SEC uses balanced clustering on low-confidence

training with ground truth. Experiments show that our method achieves steady

Hence, usual methods assign labels for unannotated data with the prediction by
a well-trained source model in an unsupervised learning framework. Previous
studies have employed unsupervised objectives, such as the entropy of model
predictions, as optimization targets to effectively learn features for
test-time samples. However, the performance of the model is easily compromised
by the quality of pseudo-labels, since inaccuracies in pseudo-labels introduce
noise to the model. Therefore, we propose to leverage the ""less probable

complementary label is introduced to designate these categories. We highlight
that the risk function of complementary labels agrees with their Vanilla loss
formula under the conventional true label distribution. Experiments show that
the proposed learning algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on

unobserved sub-populations of longitudinal processes. In particular, it
describes change patterns within each latent sub-population and examines
between-individual differences in within-individual change for each sub-group.
One research interest in utilizing GMMs is to explore how covariates affect
such heterogeneity in change patterns. Liu and Perera (2022c) extended
mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which mainly focus on time-invariant
covariates, for allowing the covariates to account for within-group and
between-group differences simultaneously and examining the heterogeneity in
nonlinear trajectories. The present study further extends Liu and Perera
(2022c) and examines the effects on trajectory heterogeneity of time-varying
covariates (TVCs). Specifically, we propose methods to decompose a TVC into a
trait feature (e.g., the baseline value of the TVC) and a set of state features
(e.g., interval-specific slopes or changes). The trait features are allowed to
account for within-group differences in growth factors of trajectories (i.e.,
trait effect), and the state features are allowed to impact observed values of
a longitudinal process (i.e., state effect). We examine the proposed models
using a simulation study and a real-world data analysis. The simulation study
demonstrated that the proposed models are capable of separating trajectories
into several clusters and generally generating unbiased and accurate estimates
with target coverage probabilities. With the proposed models, we showed the
heterogeneity in the trait and state features of reading ability across latent
classes of students' mathematics performance. Meanwhile, the trait and state
effects on mathematics development of reading ability are also heterogeneous
across the clusters of students.

At each iteration, PaFF extracts pixel-aligned feedback features from each

them together with respect to each vertex of the downsampled mesh. In this way,
our regressor can not only perceive the misalignment status of each view from

disentangles the global orientation and translation of the body mesh from the
estimation of mesh parameters such that the camera parameters of input views
can be better utilized in the regression process. The efficacy of our method is

new ways of examining literature in a manner that was not available in the

the work of William Shakespeare. The analysis shows clear change in style of
writing over time, with the most significant changes in the sentence length,
frequency of adjectives and adverbs, and the sentiments expressed in the text.
Applying machine learning to make a stylometric prediction of the year of the
play shows a Pearson correlation of 0.71 between the actual and predicted year,
indicating that Shakespeare's writing style as reflected by the quantitative
measurements changed over time. Additionally, it shows that the stylometrics of
some of the plays is more similar to plays written either before or after the
year they were written. For instance, Romeo and Juliet is dated 1596, but is
more similar in stylometrics to plays written by Shakespeare after 1600. The

mechanisms for suppressing cooling flows in cool-core clusters. However, the
composition of AGN jets and bubbles remains uncertain; they could be thermally
dominated, or dominated by cosmic-ray proton (CRp), cosmic-ray electron (CRe),
or magnetic energy. In this work, we investigate the evolution and feedback
effects of CRp and CRe dominated jets by conducting 3D magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of AGN jet-inflated bubbles in the intracluster medium using the
FLASH code. We present the evolution of their energies, dynamics and heating,
and model their expected cavity-power versus radio-luminosity relation ($P_{\rm
cav}-L_R$). We find that bubbles inflated by CRe dominated jets follow a very
similar dynamical evolution to CRp dominated bubbles even though CRe within
bubbles suffer significantly stronger synchrotron and inverse-Compton cooling.
This is because, as CRe lose their energy, the jet-inflated bubbles quickly
become thermally dominated within $\sim 30$ Myr. Their total energy stops
decreasing with CR energy and evolves similarly to CRp dominated bubbles. The
ability of CRe and CRp dominated bubbles to heat the intracluster medium is
also comparable; the cold gas formed via local thermal instabilities is well
suppressed in both cases. The CRp and CRe bubbles follow different evolutionary
trajectories on the $P_{\rm cav}-L_R$ plane, but the values are broadly
consistent with observed ranges for FRI sources. We also discuss observational
techniques that have potential for constraining the composition of AGN jets and
bubbles.

Due to the Pauli principle of quarks, the symmetry structure of the wave
functions is restricted at short distances. Consequently, the $BB$ states with
the same spin-flavor quantum numbers may be reduced into one or a few
spin-flavor states. Such reduction causes repulsion and/or suppression of
transitions at short distances. We show that the observed suppression of the
$\Xi N \to \Lambda\Lambda$ conversion can be explained following the above
argument. It is also applied to the suppression of the $\Sigma N$ to $\Lambda

geographic location. The distribution of surface units shows a latitudinal

existing literature. However, previous mapping efforts were based primarily on
compositional analysis using spectral indices (indicators) or implementation of
complex radiative transfer models, which need (prior) expert knowledge, label
data, or optical constants of representative endmembers. We prove that an
application of unsupervised learning in this instance renders a satisfactory
result in mapping the spatial distribution of ice compositions without any
prior information or label data. Thus, such an application is specifically
advantageous for a planetary surface mapping when label data are poorly
constrained or completely unknown, because an understanding of surface material

from zero to large but with finite positive values. The oscillation frequency
$\omega=E_{\rm b}/\hbar$ with $E_{\rm b}$ being the binding energy. When
$a_{s}$ is quenched to infinity or negative value, the oscillation vanishes.
Near the narrow Feshbach resonance, the interaction should be characterized by
a two-channel model. When the background scattering length $a_{\rm

three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a laser-driven shock
propagating into a stratified, multiphase medium, to investigate the post-shock

configuration used here is currently being tested in the shock tunnel at the

high-fidelity analysis of the shocked medium. Our simulations indicate that the
growth of the magnetic field, which accompanies the near-Saffman kinetic energy
decay ($E_{\textrm{kin}} \propto t^{-1.15})$ without turbulence driving,
exhibits slightly different characteristics as compared to periodic box
simulations. Seemingly no distinct phases exist in its evolution, because the
shock passage and time to observe the magnetic field amplification during the
turbulence decay are very short ($\sim\!0.3$ of a turbulent turnover time).
Yet, the growth rate is still consistent with those expected for compressive

method only uses the historical PV generation data in a given region to

an annular cavity with the fluid bath forced above the Faraday wave threshold.
We model the droplet as a kinematic point particle in air and as inelastic
collisions during impact with the bath. In both experiments and the model the
droplet is observed to chaotically change velocity with a Gaussian distribution
leading to diffusion-like behavior. In addition, the forcing above the Faraday
wave threshold on the fluid bath simplifies the wave dynamics to that of a
standing wave, which allows us to explicitly segregate the damping and driving
mechanisms. The energy gain comes from the kinematics of the droplet between
impacts, and the energy loss comes from the hydrodynamic damping at impact. We
show that this energy gain-loss formulation exhibits dynamical behavior
canonical to a wide range of damped-driven systems. The bifurcations and route
to chaos present in the droplet system reveals analogies with other
well-studied systems from optics, detonation, and electronics. This also hints
at analogies with many more systems that have yet to be analyzed in detail, and
paves a framework with which other systems can be analyzed. Finally, the
statistical distributions from experiments and theory are analyzed. Incredibly,
this simple deterministic interaction of damping and driving of the droplet
leads to more complex Brownian-like and Levy-like behavior.

framework for multi-class segmentation with both intensity and shape
constraints. Firstly, we extend a conventional non-convex energy function as an
intensity constraint and implement it with U-Net. For shape constraint,
synthetic images are generated from anatomical labels via image-to-image
translation, as shape supervision for the segmentation network. Moreover,
augmentation invariance is applied to facilitate the segmentation network to
learn the latent features in terms of shape. We evaluated the proposed
framework using the public datasets from MICCAI2019 MSCMR Challenge and
achieved promising results on cardiac MRIs with Dice scores of 0.5737, 0.7796,
and 0.6287 in Myo, LV, and RV, respectively.

the First-X, is described in this paper. The First-X is developed to handle
liquid xenon safely and efficiently, including liquefying and long-term storing
xenon without losses or contamination, and transferring cryogenic liquid xenon
between the storage module and the detector safely and effectively without
venting out. The storage module of the First-X is five specially designed
double-walled cylindrical vessels (Center Tanks) equipped with three heat
exchangers each for pressure and temperature regulation. Each Center Tank is
designed with a vacuum and multi-layer insulation and a maximum allowable
working pressure of 7.1 MPa, allowing 6 tons of xenon to be stored at 165--178
K at 0.1--0.2 MPa in the liquid phase or up to 300 K and up to 6.95 MPa in the
supercritical phase. High-pressure storage (\textgreater0.2 MPa) only occurs in
case of long-term detector shutdown or lack of nitrogen, ensuring no-loss
storage of 6 tons of xenon in the range 178--300 K. In this paper, the
thermophysical performances of the First-X and innovative scenarios to conduct
non-vented cryogen transportation were experimentally conducted and reported
using liquid argon. The non-vented cryogenic liquid filling and pump-assisted
cryogenic liquid recovery have been conducted with liquid argon at a mass flow
rate of 1390 kg/h, corresponding to a xenon mass flow rate of 2140 kg/h.
Compared with the PandaX-4T, the transportation of xenon between the detector
and the storage module is conducted in the liquid phase rather than in the
gaseous phase, and the filling rate and the recovery rate are increased by
approximately 50 times and 30 times, respectively.

observations and the target variable. However, at the moment, there is no
dominant solution for the symbolic regression task, and we aim to reduce this
gap with our algorithm. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework for symbolic expression generation via variational autoencoder (VAE).
In a nutshell, we suggest using a VAE to generate mathematical expressions, and
our training strategy forces generated formulas to fit a given dataset. Our
framework allows encoding apriori knowledge of the formulas into fast-check
predicates that speed up the optimization process. We compare our method to
modern symbolic regression benchmarks and show that our method outperforms the
competitors under noisy conditions. The recovery rate of SEGVAE is 65% on the
Ngyuen dataset with a noise level of 10%, which is better than the previously
reported SOTA by 20%. We demonstrate that this value depends on the dataset and
can be even higher.

technological and theoretical challenges. Even the physics of the key process
of resistive switching, usually associated with formation or breakage of
conductive filaments in the memristor, is not completely understood yet. This
work proposes a new resistive switching mechanism, which should be important in
the thin-filament regime and take place due to the back reaction, or recoil, of
quantum charge carriers -- independently of the conventional
electrostatically-driven ion migration. Since thinnest conductive filaments are
in question, which are only several atoms thick and allow for a
quasi-ballistic, quantized conductance, we use a mean-field theory and the
framework of nonequilibrium Green's functions to discuss the electron recoil
effect for a quantum current through a nanofilament on its geometry and compare
it with the transmission probability of charge carriers. Namely, we first study
an analytically tractable toy model of a 1D atomic chain, to qualitatively
demonstrate the importance of the charge-carrier recoil, and further proceed
with a realistic molecular-dynamics simulation of the recoil-driven ion
migration along a copper filament and the resulting resistive switching. The
results obtained are expected to add to the understanding of resistive
switching mechanisms at the nanoscale and to help downscale high-retention
memristive devices.

generic agent is a compact Borel space. At every time, each agent is randomly
coupled with another agent via their dynamics and one-stage cost function,
where this randomization is generated via the empirical distribution of their
states (i.e., the mean-field term). Therefore, the transition probability and
the one-stage cost function of each agent depend linearly on the mean-field
term, which is the key distinction between classical mean-field games and
linear mean-field games. Under mild assumptions, we show that the policy
obtained from infinite population equilibrium is $\varepsilon(N)$-Nash when the
number of agents $N$ is sufficiently large, where $\varepsilon(N)$ is an
explicit function of $N$. Then, using the linear programming formulation of
MDPs and the linearity of the transition probability in mean-field term, we
formulate the game in the infinite population limit as a generalized Nash

detecting lung and heart sounds simultaneously with only one trained model and
in invariance to the auscultation point. Methods: We use open-access data from
the 2016 Physionet/CinC Challenge, the 2022 George Moody Challenge, and from
the lung sound database HF_V1. We first train specialist single-task models
using foreground ground truth (GT) labels from different auscultation databases
to identify background sound events in the respective lung and heart
auscultation databases. The pseudo-labels generated in this way were combined
with the ground truth labels in a new training iteration, such that a new model
was subsequently trained to detect foreground and background signals. Benchmark
tests ensured that the newly trained model could detect both, lung, and heart
sound events in different auscultation sites without regressing on the original
task. We also established hand-validated labels for the respective background
signal in heart and lung sound auscultations to evaluate the models. Results:
In this work, we report for the first time results for i) a multi-class
prediction for lung sound events and ii) for simultaneous detection of heart
and lung sound events and achieve competitive results using only one model. The
combined multi-task model regressed slightly in heart sound detection and
gained significantly in lung sound detection accuracy with an overall macro F1
score of 39.2% over six classes, representing a 6.7% improvement over the
single-task baseline models. Conclusion/Significance: To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first approach developed to date for measuring heart and
lung sound events invariant to both, the auscultation site and capturing
device. Hence, our model is capable of performing lung and heart sound
detection from any auscultation location.

presence of $11$-graded exotic bosons (implied by the existence of two classes

presents a challenge. The role of the ""exotic bosonic coordinate"" was not
considered by previous works on the one-dimensional ${\mathbb Z}_2\times

point-particle models). By treating this coordinate at par with the other
graded superspace coordinates new consequences are obtained. The graded
superspace calculus of the ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$-graded worldline
super-Poincar\'e algebra induces two-dimensional ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb

from the previous two ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$-graded $2D$ versions
of super-Poincar\'e introduced in the literature. In this new superalgebra the
second translation generator and the Lorentz boost are $11$-graded.
Furthermore, if the exotic coordinate is compactified on a circle ${\bf S}^1$,
a ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$-graded closed string with periodic
boundary conditions is derived. The analysis of the irreducibility conditions
of the $2D$ supermultiplet implies that a larger $(\beta$-deformed, where
$\beta\geq 0$ is a real parameter) class of point-particle models than the ones
discussed so far in the literature (recovered at $\beta=0$) is obtained. While
the spectrum of the $\beta=0$ point-particle models is degenerate (due to its

the dynamics of DM taken into account. The gravitational-wave (GW) signature
from the DMAIC shows distinctive features. In the diffusive DM limit, the DM
admixture indirectly suppresses the post-bounce spectral peak of the NM GWs. In
the compact DM limit, the collapse dynamics of the DM in a Milky Way event
generate GWs that are strong enough to be detectable by Advanced LIGO as
continuous low-frequency ($< 1000$ Hz) signals after the NM core bounce. Our
study not only is the first-ever computation of GW from a collapsing DM object
but also provides the key features to identify DM in AIC events through future
GW detections.

spontaneous modulation of particle density. In this paper, we focus on the
supersolid stripe phase realized in a spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein
condensate and explore the properties of a class of metastable supersolids. In
particular, we study a one-dimensional supersolid whose characteristic wave
number $k$ (magnitude of wave vector) deviates from $k_{m}$, i.e., the one at
ground state. In other words, the period of density modulation is shorter or
longer than the one at ground state. We find that this class of supersolids can
still be stable if their wave numbers fall in the range $k_{c1}<k<k_{c2}$, with
two thresholds $k_{c1}$ and $k_{c2}$. Stripes with $k$ outside this range
suffer from dynamical instability with complex Bogoliubov excitation spectrum
at long wavelength. Experimentally, these stripes with $k$ away from $k_m$ are
accessible by exciting the longitudinal spin dipole mode, resulting in temporal
oscillation of stripe period as well as $k$. Within the mean-field
Gross-Pitaevskii theory, we numerically confirm that for a large enough
amplitude of spin dipole oscillation, the stripe states become unstable through
breaking periodicity, in qualitative agreement with the existence of thresholds
of $k$ for stable stripes. Our work extends the concept of supersolid and
uncovers a new class of metastable supersolids to explore.

difficult to satisfy high-precision and low-latency applications in future
wireless communications. To address this challenge, two estimators called OPSC
and OSAP-CBAM-CNN are proposed in this paper. The computational complexity of
the traditional DOA algorithm is first considered to be reduced by dividing the
total set of antennas into multiple overlapped subarrays uniformly, each
subarray crosses each other proportionally and performs DOA estimation to
generate coarse angles, and all angles are coherently combined to get the
better estimation, the final DOA estimation can given by maximum likelihood
alternating projection(ML-AP) in a very small range, which has a better
performance than the direct partitioning of subarrays. To further reduce the
complexity of traditional estimation algorithms, deep neural networks(DNN) are
utilized to offline train the relationship between the received signal
covariance matrix and the estimated angles. Due to the high complexity of the
training network based on large-scale arrays, in the OSAP-CBAM-CNN method, the
complex network is divided into several smaller networks based on the
overlapped subarray to give rough DOA estimations, followed by coherent
combining and AP algorithm to get the final DOA estimation. Simulation results
show that as the number of antennas goes to large-scale, the proposed methods
can achieve a remarkable complexity reduction over conventional ML-AP
algorithm.

frequency-dependent photon transport process. The photon transport is a typical
multiscale process governed by the nonlinear radiative transfer equations
(RTE). The flow regime of photon transport varies from the ballistic regime to
the diffusive regime with respect to optical depth and photon frequency. The
UGKP method is an asymptotic preserving (AP) scheme and a regime adaptive
scheme. The teleportation error is significantly reduced, and the computational
efficiency is remarkably improved in the diffusive regime. Distinguished from
the standard multigroup treatment, the proposed UGKP method solves the
frequency space in a non-discretized way. Therefore the Rosseland diffusion
system can be precisely preserved in the optically thick regime. Taking
advantage of the local integral solution of RTE, the distribution of the
emitted photon can be constructed from its macroscopic moments. The Monte Carlo
particles in the UGKP method need only be tracked before their first collision
events, and a re-sampling process is performed to close the photon distribution
for each time step. The large computational cost of excessive scattering events
can be saved, especially in the optically thick regime. The proposed UGKP
method is implicit and removes the light speed constraint on the time step. The
particle tracking approach combining the implicit formulation makes the
proposed UGKP method an efficient solution algorithm for frequency-dependent
radiative transfer problems. We demonstrate with numerical examples the
capability of the proposed multi-frequency UGKP method.

and construct a comprehensive and systematic benchmark for such a task, present
a thorough review of high quality UAV video datasets and benchmarks, and

used classification models for several vision tasks. Typically, a learnable
transformation (i.e. the classifier) is placed at the end of such models
returning class scores that are further normalized into probabilities by
Softmax. This learnable transformation has a fundamental role in determining
the network internal feature representation.
  In this work we show how to extract from CNNs features with the properties of
\emph{maximum} inter-class separability and \emph{maximum} intra-class
compactness by setting the parameters of the classifier transformation as not
trainable (i.e. fixed). We obtain features similar to what can be obtained with
the well-known ``Center Loss'' \cite{wen2016discriminative} and other similar
approaches but with several practical advantages including maximal exploitation
of the available feature space representation, reduction in the number of
network parameters, no need to use other auxiliary losses besides the Softmax.
  Our approach unifies and generalizes into a common approach two apparently
different classes of methods regarding: discriminative features, pioneered by
the Center Loss \cite{wen2016discriminative} and fixed classifiers, firstly
evaluated in \cite{hoffer2018fix}.
  Preliminary qualitative experimental results provide some insight on the

phenomenon containing rich physics. However, the poor sky localization due to
the long-wave nature of gravitational waves makes the identification of such
events very challenging. We propose a new method based on the wave optics
effect of the microlensing field embedded in SLGW data. The microlensing
diffraction/interference fringes can produce frequency-dependent random
fluctuations in the waveform. To pin down the microlensing induced stochastic
features in the waveform, we utilize both the template-independent method,
\texttt{cWB}, and the template-dependent method, \texttt{Bilby}, to reconstruct
the waveform with and without microlensing imprints. The mismatching degree of
these two waveforms can be treated as an indicator of SLGW events. We forecast
the identification rate of this method with the third-generation gravitational
wave observatory, such as Cosmic Explorer. Our result shows that this method
can successfully identify about 2 (out of 180) SLGW events with strong enough
microlensing effect per year. This method is entirely data-driven, which is
immune to model priors, and can greatly avoid the false positive errors
contaminated by the coincident unlensed events.

way, and derive light curves of the broad H$\beta$ line and 5100\,{\AA}

photometric data to increase sampling cadences. We subtract the host galaxy
contamination using {\it HST} imaging to correct fluxes of the calibrated light

absolute flux-calibration of the AGN continuum. We find that the H$\beta$ time
delays are correlated with the 5100\,{\AA} luminosities as $\tau_{\rm
H\beta}\propto L_{5100}^{0.46\pm0.16}$. This is remarkably consistent with
Bentz et al. (2013)'s global size-luminosity relationship of AGNs. Moreover,
the data sets for five of the seasons allow us to obtain the velocity-resolved
delays of the H$\beta$ line, showing diverse structures (outflows, inflows and
disks). Combining our results with previous independent measurements, we find
the measured dynamics of the H$\beta$ broad-line region (BLR) are possibly
related to the long-term trend of the luminosity. There is also a possible
additional $\sim$1.86 years time lag between the variation in BLR radius and
luminosity. These results suggest that dynamical changes in the BLR may be
driven by the effects of radiation pressure.

becomes lower. The thermal profile of the Hayward-AdS BH is established by
combining the temperature diagram and the shadow cast diagram, which shows that
for a fixed magnetic charge, the temperature of the Hayward-AdS BH increases
with the pressure while the region of the thermal profile decreases with the

  Estimation","13 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The goal of image ordinal estimation is to estimate the ordinal label of a
given image with a convolutional neural network. Existing methods are mainly
based on ordinal regression and particularly focus on modeling the ordinal
mapping from the feature representation of the input to the ordinal label
space. However, the manifold of the resultant feature representations does not
maintain the intrinsic ordinal relations of interest, which hinders the
effectiveness of the image ordinal estimation. Therefore, this paper proposes
learning intrinsic Consistent Ordinal REpresentations (CORE) from ordinal
relations residing in groundtruth labels while encouraging the feature
representations to embody the ordinal low-dimensional manifold. First, we
develop an ordinal totally ordered set (toset) distribution (OTD), which can
(i) model the label embeddings to inherit ordinal information and measure
distances between ordered labels of samples in a neighborhood, and (ii) model
the feature embeddings to infer numerical magnitude with unknown ordinal
information among the features of different samples. Second, through OTD, we
convert the feature representations and labels into the same embedding space
for better alignment, and then compute the Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence
between the ordinal labels and feature representations to endow the latent
space with consistent ordinal relations. Third, we optimize the KL divergence
through ordinal prototype-constrained convex programming with dual
decomposition; our theoretical analysis shows that we can obtain the optimal
solutions via gradient backpropagation. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed CORE can accurately construct an ordinal latent
space and significantly enhance existing deep ordinal regression methods to
achieve better results.

solutions, perform the covariant canonical quantization and obtain the stress
tensor in the Gupta-Bleuler (GB) physical states, which is independent of the
GF constant and is also invariant under the quantum residual gauge
transformation. The transverse stress tensor is similar in all flat
Robertson-Walker spacetimes, and its vacuum part is $\propto k^4$
  and becomes zero after the 0th-order adiabatic regularization. The
longitudinal-temporal stress tensor, in both RD and MD stages, is zero due to a
cancelation between the longitudinal and temporal parts in the GB states, and
so is the particle part of the GF stress tensor. The vacuum GF stress tensor,
in the RD stage, contains $k^4,k^2$ divergences and becomes zero by the
2nd-order regularization, however, in the MD stage, contains $k^4, k^2, k^0$
divergences and becomes zero by the 4th-order regularization. So, the order of
adequate regularization depends not only upon the type of fields, but also upon
the background spacetimes. In summary, in both the RD and MD stages, like in de
Sitter space, the total regularized vacuum stress tensor is zero, only the
transverse photon part remains, and this holds independent of the GF term.

unsteady and complex shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction involving major
parts of the flow field. The phenomenon is associated with a large-amplitude
periodic motion of the compression shock coupled with large-scale flow
separation and intermittent re-attachment. Due to the resulting large-scale
variation of the global flow topology, also the turbulent wake of the airfoil
or wing is severely affected, and so are any aerodynamic devices downstream on
which the wake impinges. To analyze and understand the turbulent structures and
dynamics of the wake, we performed a comprehensive experimental study of the
near wake of the supercritical OAT15A airfoil in transonic buffet conditions at
a chord Reynolds number of 2 mio. Velocity field measurements reveal severe
global influences of the buffet mode on both the surface-bound flow field on
the suction side of the airfoil and the wake. The flow is intermittently
strongly separated, with a significant momentum deficit that extends far into
the wake. The buffet motion induces severe disturbances and variations of the
turbulent flow, as shown on the basis of phase-averaged turbulent quantities in
terms of Reynolds shear stress and RMS-values. The spectral nature of
downstream-convecting fluctuations and turbulent structures are analyzed using
high-speed focusing schlieren sequences. Analyses of the power spectral density
pertaining to the vortex shedding in the direct vicinity of the trailing edge
indicate dominant frequencies one order of magnitude higher than those
associated with shock buffet. It is shown that the flapping motion of the shear
layer is accompanied by the formation of a von Karman-type vortex street of
fluctuating strength. These wake structures and dynamics will impact any
downstream aerodynamic devices affected by the wake.

improve the computational efficiency of deep neural networks (DNNs) for edge AI
applications with limited resources at test time. This method leverages the
fact that different test data samples may not require the same amount of
computation for a correct prediction. By allowing early exiting from full
layers of DNN inference for some test examples, we can reduce latency and
improve throughput of edge inference while preserving performance. Although
there have been numerous studies on designing specialized DNN architectures for
training early-exit enabled DNN models, most of the existing work employ
hand-tuned or manual rule-based early exit policies. In this study, we
introduce a novel multi-exit DNN inference framework, coined as EENet, which
leverages multi-objective learning to optimize the early exit policy for a
trained multi-exit DNN under a given inference budget. This paper makes two
novel contributions. First, we introduce the concept of early exit utility
scores by combining diverse confidence measures with class-wise prediction
scores to better estimate the correctness of test-time predictions at a given
exit. Second, we train a lightweight, budget-driven, multi-objective neural
network over validation predictions to learn the exit assignment scheduling for
query examples at test time. The EENet early exit scheduler optimizes both the
distribution of test samples to different exits and the selection of the exit
utility thresholds such that the given inference budget is satisfied while the
performance metric is maximized. Extensive experiments are conducted on five
benchmarks, including three image datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet) and
two NLP datasets (SST-2, AgNews). The results demonstrate the performance
improvements of EENet compared to existing representative early exit

series of multipole moments characterizing its interior mass distribution.
Dominated by the solar quadrupole moment, these deviations from spherical
symmetry significantly perturb the image that is projected by the Sun into its
focal region, especially at solar equatorial latitudes. To study the optical
properties of the quadrupole SGL, we develop an approximate solution for the
point spread function of such an extended lens. We also derive semi-analytical
expressions to estimate signal levels from extended targets. With these tools,
we study the impact of solar oblateness on imaging with the SGL. Given the
small value of the solar quadrupole moment, the majority of the signal photons
arriving from an extended target still appear within the image area projected
by the monopole lens. However, these photons are scrambled, thus reducing the
achievable signal-to-noise ratio during image recovery process (i.e.,
deconvolution). We also evaluate the spectral sensitivity for high-resolution
remote sensing of exoplanets with the extended SGL. We assess the impact on
image quality and demonstrate that despite the adverse effects of the
quadrupole moment, the SGL remains uniquely capable of delivering

  Industry","Published at The AAAI-2023 Workshop On Multimodal AI For Financial
  Forecasting",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In the insurance industry detecting fraudulent claims is a critical task with
a significant financial impact. A common strategy to identify fraudulent claims
is looking for inconsistencies in the supporting evidence. However, this is a
laborious and cognitively heavy task for human experts as insurance claims
typically come with a plethora of data from different modalities (e.g. images,
text and metadata). To overcome this challenge, the research community has
focused on multimodal machine learning frameworks that can efficiently reason
through multiple data sources. Despite recent advances in multimodal learning,
these frameworks still suffer from (i) challenges of joint-training caused by
the different characteristics of different modalities and (ii) overfitting
tendencies due to high model complexity. In this work, we address these
challenges by introducing a multimodal reasoning framework, AutoFraudNet
(Automobile Insurance Fraud Detection Network), for detecting fraudulent
auto-insurance claims. AutoFraudNet utilizes a cascaded slow fusion framework
and state-of-the-art fusion block, BLOCK Tucker, to alleviate the challenges of
joint-training. Furthermore, it incorporates a light-weight architectural
design along with additional losses to prevent overfitting. Through extensive
experiments conducted on a real-world dataset, we demonstrate: (i) the merits
of multimodal approaches, when compared to unimodal and bimodal methods, and
(ii) the effectiveness of AutoFraudNet in fusing various modalities to boost
performance (over 3\% in PR AUC).

informative patterns and insights from ever increasing noisy large-scale
datasets (in our case, satellite images). However, DL models consist of a few
thousand to millions of training parameters, and these training parameters
require tremendous amount of electrical power for extracting informative
patterns from noisy large-scale datasets (e.g., computationally expensive).
Hence, we employ a quantum-inspired tensor network for compressing trainable
parameters of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in Earth science. PINNs
are DL models penalized by enforcing the law of physics; in particular, the law
of physics is embedded in DL models. In addition, we apply tensor decomposition
to HyperSpectral Images (HSIs) to improve their spectral resolution. A
quantum-inspired tensor network is also the native formulation to efficiently
represent and train quantum machine learning models on big datasets on GPU
tensor cores. Furthermore, the key contribution of this paper is twofold: (I)
we reduced a number of trainable parameters of PINNs by using a
quantum-inspired tensor network, and (II) we improved the spectral resolution
of remotely-sensed images by employing tensor decomposition. As a benchmark
PDE, we solved Burger's equation. As practical satellite data, we employed HSIs
of Indian Pine, USA and of Pavia University, Italy.

investigated with second order derivatives. The fractional quantization for
these systems is examined using the WKB approximation. The Hamilton Jacobi
treatment can be applied for these systems. The equations of motion are
obtained. The Hamilton Jacobi partial differential equations are solved to
determine the action function. By finding the action function, the wave
function for these systems is constructed. We achieved that the quantum results
are agreement with the classical results. Besides, to demonstrate the theory;
two mathematical examples are examined.

  Detect Local News","8 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cs.IR cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Local news articles are a subset of news that impact users in a geographical
area, such as a city, county, or state. Detecting local news (Step 1) and
subsequently deciding its geographical location as well as radius of impact
(Step 2) are two important steps towards accurate local news recommendation.
Naive rule-based methods, such as detecting city names from the news title,
tend to give erroneous results due to lack of understanding of the news
content. Empowered by the latest development in natural language processing, we
develop an integrated pipeline that enables automatic local news detection and
content-based local news recommendations. In this paper, we focus on Step 1 of
the pipeline, which highlights: (1) a weakly supervised framework incorporated
with domain knowledge and auto data processing, and (2) scalability to
multi-lingual settings. Compared with Stanford CoreNLP NER model, our pipeline
has higher precision and recall evaluated on a real-world and human-labeled
dataset. This pipeline has potential to more precise local news to users, helps
local businesses get more exposure, and gives people more information about
their neighborhood safety.

technological challenges. This paper addresses the question of the crew
autonomy: as the distances increase, the communication delays and constraints
tend to prevent the astronauts from being monitored and supported by a real
time ground control. Eventually, future planetary missions will necessarily
require a form of astronaut self-scheduling. We study the usage of a computer
decision-support tool by a crew of analog astronauts, during a Mars simulation
mission conducted at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS, Mars Society) in
Utah. The proposed tool, called Romie, belongs to the new category of Robust
Advanced Modelling and Scheduling (RAMS) systems. It allows the crew members
(i) to visually model their scientific objectives and constraints, (ii) to
compute near-optimal operational schedules while taking uncertainty into
account, (iii) to monitor the execution of past and current activities, and
(iv) to modify scientific objectives/constraints w.r.t. unforeseen events and
opportunistic science. In this study, we empirically measure how the
astronauts, who are novice planners, perform at using such a tool when
self-scheduling under the realistic assumptions of a simulated Martian
planetary habitat.

network $N$, i.e. a connected antisymmetric 1-graph $G(X, U)$. Assume that,
unusually, we take the values of flows (resp. tensions) in $\mathbb{C}$. So the
algebraic lattices $\Gamma$ of flow (resp. tension) values associated to $G(X,
U)$ are lattices of $\mathbb{C}$. These lattices are congruent modulo the
action of the special linear group SL($2, \mathbb{C}$). Then, it is well known
one can define a lattice function $G_{k}(\Gamma)$, as a modular function of
weight $2k$, on the set $\mathcal{R}$ of all lattices of $\mathbb{C}$. Let now
$N_{1}, N_{2}, ..., N_{p}$ be connected antisymmetric 1-graphs and $C_{n}$, the
set of hermitian symmetric matrices $n \times n$. Let also $\mathcal{R'} $ be
the set of all the lattices of $C_{n}$. The previous structure can be
transposed to any $ n \times n $ symmetric hermitian matrices of flow (or
tension) values of the $G_{i}$. In this case, the Siegel space $S_{n}= C_{n}$
replaces the Poincar\'{e} half-plane, and the symplectic group Sp$(2n,
\mathbb{R})$ takes the place of the special linear group SL($2, \mathbb{C}$).
We get now the new lattice function as a function of all the lattices of
$S_{n}$, i.e. a model of the ""network of networks"" $\mathcal{R'}$. In the end,
we study the tree of minimal length of $\mathcal{R'}$.

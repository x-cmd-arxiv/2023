Schwarzschild black hole, which is deformed due to noncommutative corrections.
We present the deformed Schwarzschild black hole solution, which depends on the
noncommutative parameter $\Theta$, and we extract the master equation as a
Schr\""odinger-like equation, giving the explicit expression of the effective
potential which is modified due to the noncommutative corrections. We solve the
master equation numerically and we find that the noncommutative gravitational
corrections ``break"" the stability of the scalar perturbations in the long time
evolution of the massless scalar field. The significance of these results is
twofold. Firstly, our results can be related to the detection of gravitational
waves by the near future gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA, which will
have a significantly increased accuracy. In particular, these observed
gravitational waves produced by binary strong gravitational systems have
oscillating modes which can provide valuable information. Secondly, our results
can serve as an additional tool to test the predictions of general relativity,
as well as to examine the possible detection of this kind of gravitational
corrections.

  environment","This version of the manuscript contains supplemental appendices",,,,"hep-ph nucl-ex","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study procedures for discriminating combinatorial jets in a high
background environment, such as a heavy ion collision, from signal jets arising
from a hard-scattering. We investigate a population of jets clustered from a
combined PYTHIA+TennGen event, focusing on jets which can unambiguously be
classified as signal or combinatorial jets. By selecting jets based on their
kinematic properties, we investigate whether it is possible to separate signal
and combinatorial jets without biasing the signal population significantly. We
find that, after a loose selection on the jet area, surviving combinatorial
jets are dominantly imposters, combinatorial jets with properties
indistinguishable from signal jets. We also find that, after a loose selection
on the leading hadron momentum, surviving combinatorial jets are still
dominantly imposters. We use rule extraction, a machine learning technique, to
extract an optimal kinematic selection from a random forest trained on our
population of jets. In general, this technique found a stricter kinematic
selection on the jet's leading hadron momentum to be optimal. We find that it
is possible to suppress combinatorial jets significantly using this machine
learning based selection, but that some signal is removed as well. Due to this
stricter kinematic selection, we find that the surviving signal is biased
towards quark-like jets. Since similar selections are used in many
measurements, this indicates that those measurements are biased towards
quark-like jets as well. These studies should motivate an increased emphasis on
assumptions made when suppressing and subtracting combinatorial background and
the biases introduced by methods for doing so.

comparative linear material. We then correlate the variability in performance
to solitary wave formation in the system and give analytical estimates of
idealized energy absorption capacity under dynamic loading. In addition, we

quadrupole-density-wave (QDW) state at temperatures below
$T_{\textrm{0}}\approx0.4\,\textrm{K}$ and a multi-phase heavy-fermion
superconductivity with $T_{\textrm{c}}=0.26\,\textrm{K}$. The two
superconducting (SC) phases, SC1 and SC2, observed for a magnetic field $H$
parallel to the $c$ axis of the tetragonal unit cell, have been interpreted as
even- and odd-parity SC states, separated by a first order phase boundary at
$\mu_{\textrm{0}}H^{*}=4\,\textrm{T}$. Such parity switching is possible due to
a strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling at the Ce sites located in locally
non-centrosymmetric environments of the globally centrosymmetric lattice.
Existing reports suggest a possibility of the QDW transition line joining the
SC1-SC2 phase boundary at a multicritical point and propose an alternative
interpretation of the transition at $H^{*}$: It separates a mixed SC+QDW (SC1)
and a pure SC (SC2) states. Here, we present a detailed study of higher quality
single crystals of CeRh$_2$As$_2$, showing much sharper signatures of the phase

CeRh$_2$As$_2$ and demonstrate that $T_{\textrm{0}}(H)$ and $T_{\textrm{c}}(H)$
lines meet at $\mu_{\textrm{0}}H\approx6\,\textrm{T}$, well above $H^{*}$,
implying no influence of the QDW on the SC phase switching. We do not detect
the QDW transition within the SC2 state. A basic analysis with the
Ginzburg-Landau theory suggests that we have a weak competing interaction
between the two order parameters.

being widely used in industry and home settings. Recently, many learning-based
methods have been proposed to tackle this challenge, with imitation learning
showing great promise. However, imperfect demonstrations and a lack of feedback
from teleoperation systems may lead to poor or even unsafe results. In this
work we explore the effect of demonstrator force feedback on imitation
learning, using a feedback glove and a robot arm to render fingertip-level and
palm-level forces, respectively. 10 participants recorded 5 demonstrations of a
pick-and-place task with 3 grippers, under conditions with no force feedback,
fingertip force feedback, and fingertip and palm force feedback. Results show
that force feedback significantly reduces demonstrator fingertip and palm
forces, leads to a lower variation in demonstrator forces, and recorded
trajectories that a quicker to execute. Using behavioral cloning, we find that
agents trained to imitate these trajectories mirror these benefits, even though
agents have no force data shown to them during training. We conclude that
immersive demonstrations, achieved with force feedback, may be the key to
unlocking safer, quicker to execute dexterous manipulation policies.

a new perspective to solving two-player zero-sum games and yields a simplified

types of quantum phase transitions (QPTs), however it faces some challenges in
the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) phase transitions due to an essential singularity
which cannot be identified in finite derivatives of the ground state energy. In
this paper, we consider global entanglement (GE) in a KT phase transition and
show that while it does not indicate any clear signature of the phase
transition, the conditional version of GE is a good indicator with strong
signatures of the KT transition. In particular, we study a deformed version of
the $Z_d$ Kitaev model which has an intermediate KT phase which separates a
$Z_d$ topological phase from a magnetized phase at two different KT transition
points. Using a mapping to the classical $d$-state clock model, we consider GE
and the generalized GE and show that they do not provide a reliable indicator
of transition points. However, their difference called conditional global
entanglement (Q) shows a peak at the first KT transition point. Additionally,
we show that it can characterize various phases of the model as it behaves
substantially different in each phase. We therefore conclude that Q is a useful

applications, including information extraction and question answering.
Coreference resolution for English has been studied extensively. However, there
is relatively little work for other languages. A problem that frequently occurs
when working with a non-English language is the scarcity of annotated training
data. To overcome this challenge, we design a simple but effective
ensemble-based framework that combines various transfer learning (TL)
techniques. We first train several models using different TL methods. Then,
during inference, we compute the unweighted average scores of the models'
predictions to extract the final set of predicted clusters. Furthermore, we
also propose a low-cost TL method that bootstraps coreference resolution models
by utilizing Wikipedia anchor texts. Leveraging the idea that the coreferential
links naturally exist between anchor texts pointing to the same article, our
method builds a sizeable distantly-supervised dataset for the target language
that consists of tens of thousands of documents. We can pre-train a model on
the pseudo-labeled dataset before finetuning it on the final target dataset.
Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, OntoNotes and SemEval, confirm
the effectiveness of our methods. Our best ensembles consistently outperform
the baseline approach of simple training by up to 7.68% in the F1 score. These
ensembles also achieve new state-of-the-art results for three languages:

However, the lack of design and fabrication methods that are easy and

applications. Here a top-down planar approach is presented by introducing
Kirigami-inspired engineering combined with a pre-stretching process. Using
this method, Kirigami-Pre-stretched Substrate-Kirigami trilayered precursors
are created in a planar manner; upon release, the strain mismatch -- due to the
pre-stretching of substrate -- between layers would induce an out-of-plane
buckling to achieve targeted three dimensional (3D) bistable structures. By
combining experimental characterization, analytical modeling, and finite
element simulation, the effect of the pattern size of Kirigami layers and
pre-stretching on the geometry and stability of resulting 3D composites is
explored. In addition, methods to realize soft bistable structures with
arbitrary shapes and soft composites with multistable configurations are
investigated, which could encourage further applications. Our method is
demonstrated by using bistable soft Kirigami composites to construct two soft
machines: (i) a bistable soft gripper that can gently grasp delicate objects

feature of nanopore sequencing, Read Until, can eject strands from sequencers

  We propose RawHash, the first mechanism that can accurately and efficiently
perform real-time analysis of nanopore raw signals for large genomes using a
hash-based similarity search. To enable this, RawHash ensures the signals
corresponding to the same DNA content lead to the same hash value, regardless
of the slight variations in these signals. RawHash achieves an accurate
hash-based similarity search via an effective quantization of the raw signals
such that signals corresponding to the same DNA content have the same quantized
value and, subsequently, the same hash value.
  We evaluate RawHash on three applications: 1) read mapping, 2) relative
abundance estimation, and 3) contamination analysis. Our evaluations show that
RawHash is the only tool that can provide high accuracy and high throughput for
analyzing large genomes in real-time. When compared to the state-of-the-art

generation units with renewable sources of energy. The latter results in lower

problem, numerous studies have proposed the use of virtual inertia to improve
the stability properties of the power grid. In this study, we consider how
inertia variations, resulting from the application of control action associated
with virtual inertia and fluctuations in renewable generation, may affect the
stability properties of the power network within the primary frequency control
timeframe. We consider the interaction between the frequency dynamics and a
broad class of power supply dynamics in the presence of time-varying inertia
and provide locally verifiable conditions, that enable scalable designs, such
that stability is guaranteed. To complement the presented stability analysis
and highlight the dangers arising from varying inertia, we provide analytic
conditions that enable to deduce instability from single-bus inertia
fluctuations. Our analytical results are validated with simulations on the

demonstrate how inertia variations may induce large frequency oscillations and
show that the application of the proposed conditions yields a stable response.

non-interacted items with low exposure propensities are assumed to be

recommendation has been Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), which consists of
down-weighting the interacted predictions in the loss function in proportion to

offer a fast and robust region overlap estimation, hence eliminating the need
for the time-consuming global feature extraction and feature matching process
that is typically used in 3D map integration. The region overlap estimation
provides a homogeneous rigid transform that is applied as an initial condition
in the point cloud registration algorithm Fast-GICP, which provides the final
and refined alignment. The efficacy of the proposed framework is experimentally
evaluated based on multiple field multi-robot exploration missions in

Simultaneously, this challenge is one of the most difficult to address, due to

integrable, methods based on the Bethe Ansatz have succeeded in computing the

exploration algorithms have been developed which has resulted most notably in
the ABACUS library. While this performs quite well for correlations on ground
states or low-entropy states, the case of high entropy states (most importantly
at finite temperatures or after a quantum quench) is more difficult, and leaves
room for improvement. In this work, we develop a new Hilbert space exploration

X-ray coverage of NuSTAR the fitted spin and inclination are strongly
constrained for our hypothesized disk models. The faintest spectra are observed
out to 20 keV, even though their hard tail components are almost absent when
described with a simple corona. The hard tail increases with luminosity, but
shows clear two track behavior with one track having appreciably stronger
tails. The disk spectrum color-correction factor is anti-correlated with the
strength of the hard tail (e.g., as measured by the Compton $y$ parameter).
Although the spin and inclination parameters are strongly constrained for our
chosen model, the mass and distance are degenerate parameters. We use our
spectral fits, along with a theoretical prior on color-correction, an
observational prior on likely fractional Eddington luminosity, and an
observational prior on distance obtained from Gaia studies, to present mass and
distance contours for this system. The most likely parameters, given our
presumed disk model, suggest a 4.6 $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ black hole at 7.8 kpc

While many FMs exhibit natural easy-plane anisotropy in the FM film plane, the

drive large-amplitude magneto-dynamics. Here we present a new type of SHO
engineered to have the easy-plane anisotropy oriented normal to the film plane,
enabling large-amplitude easy-plane dynamics driven by spin Hall current. Our

one hand heterogeneous agents which constitute a mixed population and on the

agents prone to compromising coexist with close minded ones, the steady state
of the dynamics shows coexistent phases. In particular, unlike the homogeneous
case in networks, or the heterogeneous case in fully mixed population, it is
possible that the society ends up in consensus around one extreme opinion.
Moreover, during the dynamics, the consensus may be overturned from one extreme
to the other of the opinion space. We also show that the standard order
parameter, the normalized average size of the largest opinion cluster, may be
misleading in this case, as it hides the existence of these phases. The phase
where the opinion of the society is overturned does not require the presence of
agents with special characteristics, (stubborn, extremists, etc.); it results
from the interplay of agents which have agreed on an extreme opinion with the
remaining group that holds the opposite one. Among the former, some may be
prone to compromising with other agents which are out of the majority group,

  In the special case of unary input alphabets, we show that $k$ pebbles
suffice to compute polyregular functions of growth $O(n^k)$. This is obtained
as a corollary of a basis of simple word sequences whose ultimately periodic
combinations generate all polyregular functions with unary input. Finally, we
study polyregular and polyblind functions between unary alphabets (i.e. integer
sequences), as well as their first-order subclasses.

transferring the input signal to randomly connected recurrent neural networks
(RNNs), which are referred to as a reservoir. The high-dimensional
representation of time-series data in the reservoir significantly simplifies
subsequent learning tasks. Although this simple architecture allows fast
learning and facile physical implementation, the learning performance is
inferior to that of other state-of-the-art RNN models. In this paper, to
improve the learning ability of RC, we propose self-modulated RC (SM-RC), which
extends RC by adding a self-modulation mechanism. The self-modulation mechanism
is realized with two gating variables: an input gate and a reservoir gate. The
input gate modulates the input signal, and the reservoir gate modulates the
dynamical properties of the reservoir. We demonstrated that SM-RC can perform
attention tasks where input information is retained or discarded depending on
the input signal. We also found that a chaotic state emerged as a result of
learning in SM-RC. This indicates that self-modulation mechanisms provide RC
with qualitatively different information-processing capabilities. Furthermore,
SM-RC outperformed RC in NARMA and Lorentz model tasks. In particular, SM-RC
achieved a higher prediction accuracy than RC with a reservoir 10 times larger
in the Lorentz model tasks. Because the SM-RC architecture only requires two
additional gates, it is physically implementable as RC, providing a new
direction for realizing edge AI.

  These difficulties call for a deeper and systematic study of the structure of

Motivated by this, we present the first black-box separation of quantum money

Our empirical study, however, suggests that mainstream uncertainty-based and
diversity-based active learning policies are not effective when applied in the
3D detection task, as they fail to balance the trade-off between point cloud
informativeness and box-level annotation costs. To overcome this limitation, we
jointly investigate three novel criteria in our framework Crb for point cloud
acquisition - label conciseness}, feature representativeness and geometric
balance, which hierarchically filters out the point clouds of redundant 3D
bounding box labels, latent features and geometric characteristics (e.g., point
cloud density) from the unlabeled sample pool and greedily selects informative
ones with fewer objects to annotate. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that
the proposed criteria align the marginal distributions of the selected subset

the foreign demand shock; and (b) the domestic relevance of the foreign
countries in which the demand shocks originate from. If the foreign demand
shock from a relevant market happens in a female-intensive (male-intensive)

existing methods enumerate the complete combinations of candidate triangles,

A lack of these features in the environment can lead to the failure of the
entire odometry system. To avoid this problem, we extract feature points from
the LiDAR-generated point cloud that match features identified in LiDAR
intensity images. We then use the extracted feature points to perform scan

optimize the distance between the corresponding feature points, and the point
to plane distance for planes identified in the map. In addition, we use the
features extracted from intensity images to detect loop closure candidates from
previous scans and perform pose graph optimization. Our experiments show that
our method can run in real time with high accuracy and works well with

unsurprising as the problem lacks an explicit test oracle: the vulnerability

  In this work, we develop a metamorphic relation to tackle that challenge and
build the first fuzzing tool -- that we call EDEFuzz -- to systematically

and we assume that gradient updates follow an i.i.d. distribution --
generalized normal or Weibull, which have two degrees of freedom. In both the
distortion measure and the gradient, there is one free parameter for each that
can be fitted as a function of the iteration number. Given a choice of gradient

expected distortion in gradient reconstruction. To measure the gradient
compression performance under a communication constraint, we define the

Experiments) is a new detection system under construction for quasi-free
scattering (QFS) measurements at 200-250 MeV/nucleon at the RIBF facility of
the RIKEN Nishina Center. It consists of a charged-particle silicon tracker
coupled with a dedicated thick liquid hydrogen target (up to 150-mm long) in a
compact geometry to fit inside large scintillator or germanium arrays. Its
design was optimized for two types of studies using QFS: missing-mass
measurements and in-flight prompt $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy. This article
describes (i) the resolution requirements needed to go beyond the sensitivity
of existing systems for these two types of measurements, (ii) the conceptual
design of the system using detailed simulations of the setup and (iii) its
complete technical implementation and challenges. The final tracker aims at a
sub-mm reaction vertex resolution and is expected to reach a missing-mass
resolution below 2 MeV in $\sigma$ for $(p,2p)$ reactions when combined with
the CsI(Na) CATANA array.

devices, tablets, e-readers, and laptops) and these come equipped with
increasing resources, there is a vast potential computation power that can be
utilized from those devices. Edge computing promises to exploit these
underlying computation resources closer to users to help run latency-sensitive
applications such as augmented reality and video analytics. However, one key
missing piece has been how to incorporate personally owned unmanaged devices
into a usable edge computing system. The primary challenges arise due to the
heterogeneity, lack of interference management, and unpredictable availability
of such devices. In this paper we propose an orchestration framework IBDASH,
which orchestrates application tasks on an edge system that comprises a mix of
commercial and personal edge devices. IBDASH targets reducing both end-to-end
latency of execution and probability of failure for applications that have
dependency among tasks, captured by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). IBDASH
takes memory constraints of each edge device and network bandwidth into
consideration. To assess the effectiveness of IBDASH, we run real application
tasks on real edge devices with widely varying capabilities.We feed these
measurements into a simulator that runs IBDASH at scale. Compared to three
state-of-the-art edge orchestration schemes, LAVEA, Petrel, and LaTS, and two
intuitive baselines, IBDASH reduces the end-to-end latency and probability of
failure, by 14% and 41% on average respectively. The main takeaway from our
work is that it is feasible to combine personal and commercial devices into a
usable edge computing platform, one that delivers low latency and predictable

efficient harvesting of low-grade heat with temperatures below 100 {\deg}C. The
thermogalvanic temperature coefficient {\alpha}, usually referred to as
effective thermopower, is the key parameter determining the power density and
efficiency of thermogalvanic batteries. However, the current understanding of
improving {\alpha} of redox pairs remains at the phenomenological level without
microscopic insights, and the development of electrolytes with high {\alpha}
largely relies on experimental trial and error. This work applies the free
energy perturbation method based on molecular dynamics simulations to predict
the {\alpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair in aqueous and acetone
solutions. We showed that {\alpha} of the {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} redox pair can be
increased from 1.5{\pm}0.3 mV/K to 4.1{\pm}0.4 mV/K with the increased acetone
to water fraction. The predicted {\alpha} of {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} both in pure
water and acetone show excellent agreement with experimental values. By
monitoring the fluctuation of dipole orientations in the first solvation shell,
we discovered a significant change in the variance of solvent dipole
orientation between Fe^{3+} and Fe^{2+}, which can be a microscopic indicator
for large magnitudes of {\alpha}. The effect of acetone weight fraction in the
mixed acetone-water solvent on the {\alpha} of {Fe^{3+}/Fe^{2+}} is also
studied. Acetone molecules are found to intercalate into the first solvation
shell of the {Fe^{2+}} ion at high acetone fractions, while this phenomenon is
not observed in the solvation shell of the Fe^{3+} ion. Such solvation shell
structure change of {Fe^{2+}} ions contributes to the enhanced {\alpha} at high
acetone fractions. Our discovery provides atomistic insights into how solvation
shell order can be leveraged to develop electrolytes with high thermopower.

known, but the primary location of the absorbing material is still uncertain.
To gain more knowledge about this, we have performed a time-resolved analysis
of the X-ray spectra of 199 GRBs observed by the \textit{Swift} X-ray
telescope, searching for evidence of a decreasing column density
($N_{\mathrm{H,intr}}$) that would indicate that the GRBs are ionizing matter
in their surroundings. We structured the analysis as Bayesian inference and
used an absorbed power-law as our baseline model. We also explored alternative
spectral models in cases where decreasing absorption was inferred. The analysis
reveals seven GRBs that show signs of a decrease in $N_{\mathrm{H,intr}}$, but
we note that alternative models for the spectral evolution cannot be ruled out.
We conclude that the excess absorption in the vast majority of GRBs must
originate on large scales of the host galaxies and/or in the intergalactic
medium. Our results also imply that an evolving column density is unlikely to
affect the spectral analysis of the early X-ray spectra of GRBs. In line with
this, we show that estimating the total $N_{\mathrm{H,intr}}$ from early {\it

normalizing flow prior model and the top-down generator model by a Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based maximum likelihood algorithm, where a short-run
Langevin sampling from the intractable posterior distribution is performed to
infer the latent variables for each observed example, so that the parameters of
the normalizing flow prior and the generator can be updated with the inferred
latent variables. We show that, under the scenario of non-convergent short-run
MCMC, the finite step Langevin dynamics is a flow-like approximate inference
model and the learning objective actually follows the perturbation of the
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). We further point out that the learning
framework seeks to (i) match the latent space normalizing flow and the
aggregated posterior produced by the short-run Langevin flow, and (ii) bias the
model from MLE such that the short-run Langevin flow inference is close to the
true posterior. Empirical results of extensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of the proposed latent space normalizing flow model in the tasks

blocks usually cannot wait to receive the entire transmission frame and perform
successive interference cancellation (SIC) owing to their stringent latency
requirements. Even if SIC is feasible, it may not be perfect under finite

use GWL to characterise the expressive power of geometric GNNs that are
invariant or equivariant to physical symmetries in terms of distinguishing
geometric graphs. GWL unpacks how key design choices influence geometric GNN
expressivity: (1) Invariant layers have limited expressivity as they cannot
distinguish one-hop identical geometric graphs; (2) Equivariant layers
distinguish a larger class of graphs by propagating geometric information
beyond local neighbourhoods; (3) Higher order tensors and scalarisation enable
maximally powerful geometric GNNs; and (4) GWL's discrimination-based

  Reinforcement Learning Approach with Switching Control Strategy",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wide-area damping control for inter-area oscillation (IAO) is critical to
modern power systems. The recent breakthroughs in deep learning and the broad
deployment of phasor measurement units (PMU) promote the development of
datadriven IAO damping controllers. In this paper, the damping control of IAOs
is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and solved by the proposed Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) based deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
approach. The proposed approach optimizes the eigenvalue distribution of the
system, which determines the IAO modes in nature. The eigenvalues are evaluated
by the data-driven method called dynamic mode decomposition. For a given power
system, only a subset of generators selected by participation factors needs to
be controlled, alleviating the control and computing burdens. A Switching
Control Strategy (SCS) is introduced to improve the transient response of IAOs.
Numerical simulations of the IEEE-39 New England power grid model validate the
effectiveness and advanced performance of the proposed approach as well as its
robustness against communication delays. In addition, we demonstrate the
transfer ability of the DRL model trained on the linearized power grid model to
provide effective IAO damping control in the non-linear power grid model
environment.

Hence, the existing deep learning methods are mostly trained on very limited

cannot be used in clinical setups. To this end, we propose an efficient 3D deep

in the age determinations of halo stars adopting both asteroseismic and classic
observational constraints. [...] We adopt the well-tested SCEPtER pipeline,
covering evolutionary phases up to the red giant branch (RGB). The fitting
grids contain stars with mass in the range of [0.7; 1.0] $M_{\odot}$ and
metallicity [Fe/H] from -2.5 to -0.5. We investigate several scenarios
characterised by different adopted observational uncertainties. We also assess
the impact of systematic discrepancies between the recovery grid models and
target stars by computing several synthetic grids of stellar models with
perturbed input physics. In our reference scenario, we recover ages for stars
in the main sequence (MS) or subgiant branch (SGB) with a typical 10\%--20\%
precision, while we recover those of RGB stars with a precision of about 60\%.
However, adopting tighter constraints on asteroseismic parameters, the age
precision in RGB improved to 20\%, while few modifications occur in the other
analysed evolutionary phases. A systematic discrepancies between grid models
and target stars shows that a mismatch in the mixing-length parameter value
leads to significant bias in the age estimations for MS stars (about 10\%), but
this bias is smaller for SGB and RGB stars. Neglecting the microscopic
diffusion effect in the recovery grid leads to a typical 40\% bias in age
estimates for stars on the MS. Finally, we applied the technique to stars in
globular clusters. We find a precision in age estimates of around 20\% for MS
stars and up to 40\% for RGB stars, greater than those obtained with classical
methods. We demonstrate the method on stars of the cluster M4, obtaining a
cluster age of $11.9 \pm 1.5$ Gyr and a mass at the turn-of off $0.86 \pm 0.04$
$M_{\odot}$, which are in good agreement with literature results.

entanglement and Bell nonlocality. In the paradigmatic scenario involving the
protagonists Alice and Bob, the entangled state shared between them, is said to
be steerable from Alice to Bob if the steering assemblage on Bob's side do not
admit a local hidden state (LHS) description. Quantum conditional entropies, on
the other hand provide for another characterization of quantum correlations.
Contrary to our common intuition conditional entropies for some entangled
states can be negative, marking a significant departure from the classical
realm. Quantum steering and quantum nonlocality in general share an intricate
relation with quantum conditional entropies. In the present contribution, we
investigate this relationship. For a significant class, namely the two-qubit
Weyl states we show that negativity of conditional R\'enyi 2-entropy and
conditional Tsallis 2-entropy is a necessary and sufficient condition for the
violation of a suitably chosen three settings steering inequality. With respect
to the same inequality we find an upper bound for the conditional R\'enyi
2-entropy, such that the general two-qubit state is steerable. Moving from a
particular steering inequality to local hidden state descriptions, we show that
some two-qubit Weyl states which admit a LHS model possess non-negative
conditional R\'enyi 2-entropy. However, the same does not hold true for some
non-Weyl states. Our study further investigates the relation between
non-negativity of conditional entropy and LHS models in two-qudits for the
isotropic and Werner states. There we find that whenever these states admit a
LHS model, they possess a non-negative conditional R\'enyi 2-entropy. We then
observe that the same holds true for a noisy variant of the two-qudit Werner
state.

proposed as the prime way of measuring their redshift and studying their
stellar populations. These galaxies might represent the best examples of cosmic
reionizers, as suggested by recent low-z observations of Lyman Continuum
emitting galaxies, but it is hard to directly study the production and escape
of ionizing photons at such high redshifts. The ESO spectroscopic public survey
VANDELS offers the unique opportunity to find rare examples of such galaxies at
cosmic noon ($z\sim 3$), thanks to the ultra deep observations available. We
have selected a sample of 39 galaxies showing C IV emission, whose origin
(after a careful comparison to photoionization models) can be ascribed to star
formation and not to AGN. By using a multi-wavelength approach, we determine
their physical properties including metallicity and ionization parameter and
compare them to the properties of the parent population to understand what are
the ingredients that could characterize the analogs of the cosmic reionizers.
We find that C IV emitters are galaxies with high photons production efficiency
and there are strong indications that they might have also large escape
fraction: given the visibility of C IV in the epoch of reionization this could
become the best tool to pinpoint the cosmic reioinzers.

this paper we investigate another possibility, namely that the inflaton climbs
up its potential. When it turns back, its velocity crosses zero, which triggers
a short phase of ``uphill inflation'' during which cosmological perturbations
grow at a very fast rate. This naturally occurs in double-well potentials if
the width of the well is close to the Planck scale. We include the effect of
quantum diffusion in this scenario, which plays a crucial role, by means of the

X-rays, comparison with a previous image of the same patient is very valuable
to radiologists. Today, the most common approach for deep learning methods to
automatically inspect chest X-rays disregards the patient history and
classifies only single images as normal or abnormal. Nevertheless, several
methods for assisting in the task of comparison through image registration have
been proposed in the past. However, as we illustrate, they tend to miss
specific types of pathological changes like cardiomegaly and effusion. Due to
assumptions on fixed anatomical structures or their measurements of
registration quality, they produce unnaturally deformed warp fields impacting
visualization of differences between moving and fixed images. We aim to
overcome these limitations, through a new paradigm based on individual rib pair
segmentation for anatomy penalized registration. Our method proves to be a
natural way to limit the folding percentage of the warp field to 1/6 of the
state of the art while increasing the overlap of ribs by more than 25%,
implying difference images showing pathological changes overlooked by other
methods. We develop an anatomically penalized convolutional multi-stage
solution on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) data set, starting from
less than 25 fully and 50 partly labeled training images, employing sequential
instance memory segmentation with hole dropout, weak labeling, coarse-to-fine
refinement and Gaussian mixture model histogram matching. We statistically
evaluate the benefits of our method and highlight the limits of currently used
metrics for registration of chest X-rays.

  Constraints and Beyond","A short version of this work appeared in the proceedings of the 30th
  annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2019)",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Short spanning trees subject to additional constraints are important building
blocks in various approximation algorithms. Especially in the context of the
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), new techniques for finding spanning trees
with well-defined properties have been crucial in recent progress. We consider
the problem of finding a spanning tree subject to constraints on the edges in
cuts forming a laminar family of small width. Our main contribution is a new
dynamic programming approach where the value of a table entry does not only
depend on the values of previous table entries, as it is usually the case, but
also on a specific representative solution saved together with each table
entry. This allows for handling a broad range of constraint types.
  In combination with other techniques -- including negatively correlated
rounding and a polyhedral approach that, in the problems we consider, allows
for avoiding potential losses in the objective through the randomized rounding
-- we obtain several new results. We first present a quasi-polynomial time
algorithm for the Minimum Chain-Constrained Spanning Tree Problem with an
essentially optimal guarantee. More precisely, each chain constraint is
violated by a factor of at most $1+\varepsilon$, and the cost is no larger than
that of an optimal solution not violating any chain constraint. The best
previous procedure is a bicriteria approximation violating each chain
constraint by up to a constant factor and losing another factor in the
objective. Moreover, our approach can naturally handle lower bounds on the
chain constraints, and it can be extended to constraints on cuts forming a
laminar family of constant width.
  Furthermore, we show how our approach can also handle parity constraints (or,
more precisely, a proxy thereof) as used in the context of (Path) TSP and one
of its generalizations, and discuss implications in this context.

While horizontal gene transfer, which corresponds to the exchange of genetic

organisms, its impact on the phenotypic density of populations is not yet fully
understood.
  We study an elliptic integro-differential equation describing the
evolutionary equilibrium of the phenotypic density of an asexual population. In
a regime of small mutational variance, we characterize the solution which
results from the balance between competition for a resource, mutation and
horizontal gene transfer. We show that in a certain range of parameters
polymorphic equilibria exist, which means that the phenotypic density may
concentrate around several dominant traits. Such polymorphic equilibria result
from an antagonist interplay between horizontal gene transfer and selection,
while similar models which neglect the transfer lead only to monomorphic
equilibria.

usage for early screening of cardiovascular diseases. Due to the high

auxiliary diagnosis and reduce the burdens of training professional clinicians.
Nevertheless, classic machine learning is limited to performance improvement in
the era of big data. Deep learning has achieved better performance than classic
machine learning in many research fields, as it employs more complex model
architectures with stronger capability of extracting effective representations.
Deep learning has been successfully applied to heart sound analysis in the past
years. As most review works about heart sound analysis were given before 2017,
the present survey is the first to work on a comprehensive overview to
summarise papers on heart sound analysis with deep learning in the past six

industry-relevant applications. With the field still in its infancy, there are
many competing techniques. This work is an attempt to systematically compare a
broad range of these techniques to guide quantum computing practitioners when
deciding which models and techniques to use in their applications. We compare
fundamentally different architectural ansatzes of parametric quantum circuits
used for quantum generative modeling: 1. A continuous architecture, which
produces continuous-valued data samples, and 2. a discrete architecture, which
samples on a discrete grid. We compare the performance of different data
transformations: normalization by the min-max transform or by the probability
integral transform. We learn the underlying probability distribution of the
data sets via two popular training methods: 1. quantum circuit Born machines
(QCBM), and 2. quantum generative adversarial networks (QGAN). We study their
performance and trade-offs as the number of model parameters increases, with
the baseline of similarly trained classical neural networks. The study is
performed on six low-dimensional synthetic and two real financial data sets.
Our two key findings are that: 1. For all data sets, our quantum models require
similar or fewer parameters than their classical counterparts. In the extreme
case, the quantum models require two of orders of magnitude less parameters. 2.
We empirically find that a variant of the discrete architecture, which learns
the copula of the probability distribution, outperforms all other methods.

adopting a k-shortest path-based algorithm, the theoretical worst case
complexity becomes $O(|\mathcal{V}^{\tau}|! \cdot |\mathcal{V}^{\tau}|^3)$.
Although it runs fast in most cases, its solution can be sub-optimal and may

understood well with the simulation. The main problem with VOFET is the high

There have been many efforts in reducing the off-state current by the addition
of an insulating layer on top of the source electrode, which further increases
the complexity and cost of processing. Simulations based on device geometry,

constant $H_0$ inferred from the cosmic microwave background and the supernovae
observations. In order to alleviate this tension, we propose a modification to
the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by replacing the cosmological constant
$\Lambda$ with a dynamical scalar field in the framework of Horndeski gravity,
which drives the late time accelerated expanding phase of the Universe. With a
combination of the $G_4$ and $G_5$ terms of the Horndeski Lagrangian, we show
that, it is possible to construct viable scenarios for alleviating the Hubble
tension which are free from gradient and ghost instabilities and the
superluminal propagation of the scalar and tensor perturbations. Working with
two different classes of scalar field potentials and with appropriate choices
of model parameters, we exhibit that one can obtain a large enough value of
$H_0$, so as to be consistent with the late Universe observations. Since these
modifications are extremely small at early times, the corresponding deviations
from the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology are completely negligible at high redshifts.

the martingale $\rm BMO.$ Then the semi-martingale $f\cdot g:=(f_ng_n)_{n\in

$$\Phi(t):=\frac{t}{\log(e+t)},\quad \forall\, t\in[0,\infty).$$ The above
bilinear decomposition $L^1+H_{\log}$ is sharp in the sense that, for

the largest subspace of $H_1$, denoted by $H^b_1$ with $b\in {\rm BMO}$, such
that the commutators $[T, b]$ with classical sublinear operators $T$ are
bounded from $H^b_1$ to $L^1$. This endpoint boundedness of commutators allow
the authors to give more applications. On the one hand, in the martingale
setting, the authors obtain the endpoint estimates of commutators for both
martingale transforms and martingale fractional integrals. On the other hand,
in harmonic analysis, the authors establish the endpoint estimates of

due to their great versatility in mechanical and mechatronic systems. As main
rheological features, MRFs must present low viscosity in the absence of a
magnetic field (0.1 - 1.0 Pa.s) and high yield stress (50 - 100 kPa) when
magnetized, in order to optimize the magnetorheological effect. Such
properties, in turn, are directly influenced by the composition, volume
fraction, size, and size distribution (polydispersity) of the particles, the
latter being an important piece in the improvement of these main properties. In
this context, the present work aims to analyze, through experiments and
simulations, the influence of polydispersity on the maximum packing fraction,
on the yield stress under field (on-state), and on the plastic viscosity in the
absence of field (off-state) of concentrated MRF (phi = 48.5 vol.%). Three
blends of carbonyl iron powder in polyalphaolefin oil were prepared. These
blends have the same mode, but different polydispersity indexes, ranging from
0.46 to 1.44. Separate simulations show that the random close packing fraction
increases from about 68% to 80% as the polydispersity index increases over this
range. The on-state yield stress, in turn, is raised from 30 +/- 0.5 kPa to 42
+/- 2 kPa (B ~ 0.57 T) and the off-state plastic viscosity, is reduced from 4.8
Pa.s to 0.5 Pa.s. Widening the size distributions, as is well known in the
literature, increases packing efficiency and reduces the viscosity of
concentrated dispersions, but beyond that, it proved to be a viable way to
increase the magnetorheological effect of concentrated MRF. The Brouwers model,
which considers the void fraction in suspensions of particles with lognormal
distribution, was proposed as a possible hypothesis to explain the increase in
yield stress under magnetic field.

controlling radiolysis and sputtering of astrophysical ices due to their
bombardment by cosmic ray ions. Such ions are slowed down due to inelastic
collisions with bound electrons, resulting in ionization and excitation of ice
molecules. In experiments on CO ice irradiation, we show that the relative
contribution of these two mechanisms of energy loss to molecule destruction and
sputtering can be probed by selecting ion energies near the peak of the
electronic stopping power. We have observed a significant asymmetry, both in
the destruction cross section and the sputtering yield, for pairs of ion
energies corresponding to same values of the stopping power on either side of
the peak. This implies that the stopping power does not solely control these
processes, as usually assumed in the literature. Our results suggest that
electronic excitations represent a significantly more efficient channel for
radiolysis and, possibly, also for sputtering of CO ice. We also show that the
charge state of incident ions as well as the rate for CO$^+$ production in the
ice have negligible effect on these processes.

functions of primordial black holes (PBHs). The mass functions of PBHs are
simply estimated using the conventional Press-Schechter formalism for different
paradigms of cosmic origin, including inflationary $\Lambda$CDM and bounce
cosmology. The standard inflationary $\Lambda$CDM model cannot generate an
appreciable number of massive PBHs; however, non-trivial inflation models with
blue-tilted power spectra at small scales and matter bounce cosmology provide
formation mechanisms for heavy PBHs, which in turn, may seed the observed
supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Fitting the observed mass functions of SMBHs
in the local universe, we derive for the first time constraints on the PBH
current density fraction $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$ and the characteristic mass
$M_{\star}$ for different paradigms of cosmic origin, with the prior assumption
that all local SMBHs stem from PBHs. We demonstrate that this newly proposed

Our results improve our understanding of contagion processes and provide a

additionally shown that the ultra-strong coupling regime is preserved when the

relative strength $\eta = \Omega_R / \omega_0 = 0.12$. This represents an
important milestone for future studies of quantum vacuum radiation because such

the generation of non-classical light via the dynamic Casimir effect. Finally,

proposed to measure the difference between two networks in terms of persistent

probing the topology of the Cosmic web, in contrast to graph-theoretical

as points in a point cloud we calculate persistent homologies, build
persistence (birth-death) diagrams and evaluate Wasserstein distance between

discrimination ability depends on redshift $z$, as well as on the
dimensionality of considered homology features. We find that the highest
discriminating power this tool obtains at $z=2$ snapshots, among the considered

by speeding design iterations and permitting more exhaustive exploration. One
possibility is to exploit low-level parallelism, as RTL expresses considerable
fine-grain concurrency. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art RTL simulators often
perform best on a single core since modern processors cannot effectively

practical. Moreover, static scheduling dramatically simplifies processor

  Real-world Image Deraining","9 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent diffusion models show great potential in generative modeling tasks.
This motivates us to raise an intriguing question - What will happen when
unsupervised learning meets diffusion models for real-world image deraining?
Before answering it, we observe two major obstacles of diffusion models in
real-world image deraining: the need for paired training data and the limited
utilization of multi-scale rain patterns. To overcome the obstacles, we propose
RainDiffusion, the first real-world image deraining paradigm based on diffusion
models. RainDiffusion is a non-adversarial training paradigm that introduces
stable training of unpaired real-world data, rather than weakly adversarial
training, serving as a new standard bar for real-world image deraining. It
consists of two cooperative branches: Non-diffusive Translation Branch (NTB)
and Diffusive Translation Branch (DTB). NTB exploits a cycle-consistent
architecture to bypass the difficulty in unpaired training of regular diffusion
models by generating initial clean/rainy image pairs. Given initial image
pairs, DTB leverages multi-scale diffusion models to progressively refine the
desired output via diffusive generative and multi-scale priors, to obtain a
better generalization capacity of real-world image deraining. Extensive
experiments confirm the superiority of our RainDiffusion over eight
un/semi-supervised methods and show its competitive advantages over seven
fully-supervised ones.

of the most profound challenges in the field of computer-aided diagnosis. The
appearance disparity of pathological whole slide images causes algorithms to
become less reliable, which in turn impedes the wide-spread applicability of
downstream tasks like cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, different stainings lead
to biases in the training which in case of domain shifts negatively affect the
test performance. Therefore, in this paper we propose MultiStain-CycleGAN, a
multi-domain approach to stain normalization based on CycleGAN. Our
modifications to CycleGAN allow us to normalize images of different origins
without retraining or using different models. We perform an extensive
evaluation of our method using various metrics and compare it to commonly used
methods that are multi-domain capable. First, we evaluate how well our method
fools a domain classifier that tries to assign a medical center to an image.
Then, we test our normalization on the tumor classification performance of a
downstream classifier. Furthermore, we evaluate the image quality of the
normalized images using the Structural similarity index and the ability to
reduce the domain shift using the Fr\'echet inception distance. We show that
our method proves to be multi-domain capable, provides the highest image
quality among the compared methods, and can most reliably fool the domain
classifier while keeping the tumor classifier performance high. By reducing the
domain influence, biases in the data can be removed on the one hand and the
origin of the whole slide image can be disguised on the other, thus enhancing
patient data privacy.

effects with the highest possible precision. However, sparse networks with few
available studies and limited direct evidence can arise, threatening the
robustness and reliability of NMA estimates. In these cases, the limited amount
of available information can hamper the formal evaluation of the underlying NMA
assumptions of transitivity and consistency. In addition, NMA estimates from
sparse networks are expected to be imprecise and possibly biased as they rely
on large sample approximations which are invalid in the absence of sufficient
data. We propose a Bayesian framework that allows sharing of information
between two networks that pertain to different population subgroups.
Specifically, we use the results from a subgroup with a lot of direct evidence
(a dense network) to construct informative priors for the relative effects in
the target subgroup (a sparse network). This is a two-stage approach where at
the first stage we extrapolate the results of the dense network to those
expected from the sparse network. This takes place by using a modified
hierarchical NMA model where we add a location parameter that shifts the
distribution of the relative effects to make them applicable to the target
population. At the second stage, these extrapolated results are used as prior
information for the sparse network. We illustrate our approach through a
motivating example of psychiatric patients. Our approach results in more
precise and robust estimates of the relative effects and can adequately inform
clinical practice in presence of sparse networks.

isolating those with markedly increasing patent trends and identifying green

valuation in insurance. Aggregate insurance liability cashflows typically
correspond to stochastic payments several years into the future. However,
insurance regulation requires that capital requirements are computed for a
one-year horizon, by considering cashflows during the year and end-of-year
liability values. This implies that liability values must be computed
recursively, backwards in time, starting from the year of the most distant
liability payments. Solving such backward recursions with paper and pen is
rarely possible, and numerical solutions give rise to major computational
challenges.
  The aim of this paper is to provide explicit and easily computable
expressions for multi-period valuations that appear as limit objects for a

convergence. Such convergence appears naturally if we consider large insurance
portfolios such that the liability cashflows, appropriately centered and

effects of treatment and monitoring disease progression. However, MRI, and
particularly longitudinal MRI, is known to be time consuming. To accelerate
imaging, compressed sensing (CS) theory has been applied to exploit sparsity,
both on single image as on image sequence level. State-of-the-art CS methods
however, are generally focused on image reconstruction, and consider analysis
(e.g., alignment, change detection) as a post-processing step.
  In this study, we propose DELTA-MRI, a novel framework to estimate
longitudinal image changes {\it directly} from a reference image and
subsequently acquired, strongly sub-sampled MRI k-space data. In contrast to
state-of-the-art longitudinal CS based imaging, our method avoids the
conventional multi-step process of image reconstruction of subsequent images,
image alignment, and deformation vector field computation. Instead, the set of
follow-up images, along with motion and deformation vector fields that describe
their relation to the reference image, are estimated in one go. Experiments
show that DELTA-MRI performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art in
terms of the normalized reconstruction error.

Using this equivalence, we improve the current best upper bounds on the

improve the current best lower bounds on strong blocking set.
  Over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_3$, we prove that minimal codes are
equivalent to linear trifferent codes. Using this equivalence, we show that any
linear trifferent code of length $n$ has size at most $3^{n/4.55}$, improving

weak winds with mass-loss rates lower than 10$^{-8} M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. This
implies that their photospheric layers are not strongly affected by the stellar

tested for analyses of late O-type stars. A sample of 20 mostly sharp-lined
Galactic O stars of spectral types O8 to O9.7 and luminosity classes V and IV,
previously studied in the literature using full non-LTE model atmospheres, is
investigated. Methods. Hydrostatic plane-parallel atmospheric structures and
synthetic spectra computed with Kurucz's Atlas12 code together with non-LTE
line-formation codes Detail and Surface, which account for the effects of
turbulent pressure on the atmosphere, were employed. High-resolution spectra
were analysed to derive atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances.
Fundamental stellar parameters were derived by considering stellar evolution
tracks and Gaia EDR3 parallaxes. Interstellar reddening was characterised by
fitting spectral energy distributions from the UV to the mid-IR. Results. A
high precision and accuracy is achieved for all derived parameters for 16
sample stars. Turbulent pressure effects turn out have significant effects.
Effective temperatures are determined to 1-3% uncertainty levels, surface
gravities to 0.05 to 0.10 dex, masses to better than 8%, radii to better than
10%, and luminosities to better than 20% uncertainty typically. Abundances for

HARPS-N spectra of eta Aql to derive its radial velocity curve using different

of the SBCR is critical: a scatter of about 8% is found in the projection
factor for different SBCRs in the literature. The uncertainty on the
coefficients of the SBCR affects the statistical precision of the projection
factor only little (1-2\%). Confirming previous studies, we find that the
method with which the radial velocity curve is derived is also critical, with a
potential difference on the projection factor of 9%. An increase of 0.1 in
E(B-V) translates into a decrease in the projection factor of 3%. A 0.1
magnitude effect of a circumstellar envelope (CSE) in the visible domain is
rather small on the projection factor, about 1.5%. However, we find that a 0.1
mag infrared excess in the K band due to a CSE can increase the projection
factor by about 6%. The impact of the surface-brightness color relation on the

breeders large enough to ensure the feasibility of appropriate breeding

an important reduction in the effective population size: the effective

diffusion model which encodes a batch of instances from a dataset into
evolutionary states that progressively incorporate other instances' information
by their interactions. The diffusion process is constrained by descent criteria
w.r.t.~a principled energy function that characterizes the global consistency
of instance representations over latent structures. We provide rigorous theory
that implies closed-form optimal estimates for the pairwise diffusion strength
among arbitrary instance pairs, which gives rise to a new class of neural
encoders, dubbed as DIFFormer (diffusion-based Transformers), with two
instantiations: a simple version with linear complexity for prohibitive
instance numbers, and an advanced version for learning complex structures.
Experiments highlight the wide applicability of our model as a general-purpose
encoder backbone with superior performance in various tasks, such as node
classification on large graphs, semi-supervised image/text classification, and
spatial-temporal dynamics prediction.

is to preprocess $S$ to subsequently support efficient pattern matching
queries, i.e., given a pattern string $P$ report all the occurrences of $P$ in
$S$. In this paper we study the 'streaming sliding window string indexing
problem'. Here the string $S$ arrives as a stream, one character at a time, and
the goal is to maintain an index of the last $w$ characters, called the
'window', for a specified parameter $w$. At any point in time a pattern
matching query for a pattern $P$ may arrive, also streamed one character at a
time, and all occurrences of $P$ within the current window must be returned.
The streaming sliding window string indexing problem naturally captures
scenarios where we want to index the most recent data (i.e. the window) of a
stream while supporting efficient pattern matching.
  Our main result is a simple $O(w)$ space data structure that uses $O(\log w)$
time with high probability to process each character from both the input string
$S$ and the pattern string $P$. Reporting each occurrence from $P$ uses
additional constant time per reported occurrence. Compared to previous work in
similar scenarios this result is the first to achieve an efficient worst-case
time per character from the input stream. We also consider a delayed variant of
the problem, where a query may be answered at any point within the next
$\delta$ characters that arrive from either stream. We present an $O(w +
\delta)$ space data structure for this problem that improves the above time
bounds to $O(\log(w/\delta))$. In particular, for a delay of $\delta = \epsilon
w$ we obtain an $O(w)$ space data structure with constant time processing per
character. The key idea to achieve our result is a novel and simple
hierarchical structure of suffix trees of independent interest, inspired by the
classic log-structured merge trees.

($M_{\rm\,UV}\simeq-22$) that are similarly spectroscopically confirmed at
$z\gtrsim8$, these NIRCam-selected galaxies are characterized by lower star
formation rates (SFR$\simeq4\,M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$) and lower stellar masses
($\simeq10^{8}\,M_{\odot}$), but with higher [OIII]+H$\beta$ equivalent widths
($\simeq$1100$\r{A}$), and elevated production efficiency of ionizing photons
($\log(\xi_{\rm\,ion}/{\rm\,Hz\,erg}^{-1})\simeq25.8$) induced by young stellar
populations ($<10$~Myrs) accounting for $\simeq20\%$ of the galaxy mass,
highlighting the key contribution of faint galaxies to cosmic reionization.
Taking advantage of the homogeneous selection and sensitivity, we also
investigate metallicity and ISM conditions with empirical calibrations using
the [OIII]/H$\beta$ ratio. We find that galaxies at $z\sim8-9$ have higher SFRs

PDE systems with multidimensional input parametric spaces by leveraging models
of different fidelity. The design of this methodology allows a user to
adaptively sample points ad hoc from a discrete training set with no prior
requirement of error estimators. It is achieved by exploiting low-fidelity
models throughout the parametric space to sample points using an efficient
sampling strategy, and at the sampled parametric points, high-fidelity models
are evaluated to recover the reduced basis functions. The low-fidelity models
are then adapted with the reduced order models ( ROMs) built by projection onto
the subspace spanned by the recovered basis functions. The process continues
until the low-fidelity model can represent the high-fidelity model adequately
for all the parameters in the parametric space. Since the proposed methodology
leverages the use of low-fidelity models to assimilate the solution database,
it significantly reduces the computational cost in the offline stage. The
highlight of this article is to present the construction of the initial
low-fidelity model, and a sampling strategy based on the discrete empirical
interpolation method (DEIM). We test this approach on a 2D steady-state heat
conduction problem for two different input parameters and make a qualitative
comparison with the classical greedy reduced basis method (RBM), and further
test on a 9-dimensional parametric non-coercive elliptic problem and analyze
the computational performance based on different tuning of greedy selection of

consider a class of nonlinear dynamical systems whose nonlinear terms are

model, such as second-order, time-delay, or fractional-order systems. Our
approach relies on the Volterra series representation of these dynamical
systems. Using this representation, we identify the kernels and, thus, the
generalized multivariate transfer functions associated with these systems.
Consequently, we present results allowing the construction of reduced-order
models whose generalized transfer functions interpolate these of the original
system at pre-defined frequency points. For efficient calculations, we also
need the concept of a symmetric Kronecker product representation of a tensor
and derive particular properties of them. Moreover, we propose an algorithm
that extracts dominant subspaces from the prescribed interpolation conditions.
This allows the construction of reduced-order models that preserve the
structure. We also extend these results to parametric systems and a special

This hypothesis is compelling because it explains economic change through
endogenous mechanisms, but it has not been quantitatively tested at the global
economy level. Here, we use an inverse modelling technique and 59 years of
economic data covering 77 countries to test whether the collective dynamics of
national economic activities can be characterised by eco-evolutionary
processes. We estimate the statistical support of dynamic community models in
which the dynamics of economic activities are coupled with positive and
negative interactions between the activities, the spatial dispersal of the
activities, and their transformations into other economic activities. We find
strong support for the models capturing positive interactions between economic
activities and spatial dispersal of the activities across countries. These
results suggest that processes akin to those occurring in ecosystems play a
significant role in the dynamics of economic systems. The strength-of-evidence
obtained for each model varies across countries and may be caused by
differences in the distance between countries, specific institutional contexts,
and historical contingencies. Overall, our study provides a new quantitative,

interaction possibilities for remote XR collaboration using high-fidelity
reconstructions of physical activity spaces. However, creating these
reconstructions often lacks user involvement with an overt focus on capturing
sensory context that does not necessarily augment an informal social
experience. This work seeks to understand social context that can be important
for reconstruction to enable XR applications for informal instructional
scenarios. Our study involved the evaluation of an XR remote guidance prototype
by 8 intergenerational groups of closely related gardeners using
reconstructions of personally meaningful spaces in their gardens. Our findings
contextualize physical objects and areas with various motivations related to
gardening and detail perceptions of XR that might affect the use of
reconstructions for remote interaction. We discuss implications for user
involvement to create reconstructions that better translate real-world
experience, encourage reflection, incorporate privacy considerations, and
preserve shared experiences with XR as a medium for informal intergenerational
activities.

detection of neuromuscular disorders and the control of human-machine
interfaces. Individual motor unit firings are currently identified in vivo by
decomposing electromyographic (EMG) signals. Due to our body's electric
properties, individual motor units can only be separated to a limited extent
with surface EMG. Unlike electrical signals, magnetic fields pass through
biological tissues without distortion. This physical property and emerging
technology of quantum sensors make magnetomyography (MMG) a highly promising
methodology. However, the full potential of MMG to study neuromuscular
physiology has not yet been explored. In this work, we perform in silico trials
that combine a biophysical model of EMG and MMG with state-of-the-art
algorithms for the decomposition of motor units. This allows the prediction of
an upper-bound for the motor unit decomposition accuracy. It is shown that
non-invasive MMG is superior over surface EMG for the robust identification of
the discharge patterns of individual motor units. Decomposing MMG instead of
EMG increased the number of identifiable motor units by 71%. Notably, MMG
exhibits a less pronounced bias to detect superficial motor units. The
presented simulations provide insights into methods to study the neuromuscular
system non-invasively and in vivo that would not be easily feasible by other
means. Hence, this study provides guidance for the development of novel
biomedical technologies.

vehicle re-identification. However, existing approaches directly model part
features and global features, which can easily lead to serious gradient
vanishing issues due to their unequal feature information and unreliable
pseudo-labels for unsupervised vehicle re-identification. To address this
problem, in this paper, we propose a simple Triplet Contrastive Representation
Learning (TCRL) framework which leverages cluster features to bridge the part
features and global features for unsupervised vehicle re-identification.
Specifically, TCRL devises three memory banks to store the instance/cluster
features and proposes a Proxy Contrastive Loss (PCL) to make contrastive
learning between adjacent memory banks, thus presenting the associations
between the part and global features as a transition of the part-cluster and
cluster-global associations. Since the cluster memory bank copes with all the
vehicle features, it can summarize them into a discriminative feature
representation. To deeply exploit the instance/cluster information, TCRL
proposes two additional loss functions. For the instance-level feature, a
Hybrid Contrastive Loss (HCL) re-defines the sample correlations by approaching
the positive instance features and pushing the all negative instance features
away. For the cluster-level feature, a Weighted Regularization Cluster
Contrastive Loss (WRCCL) refines the pseudo labels by penalizing the mislabeled
images according to the instance similarity. Extensive experiments show that
TCRL outperforms many state-of-the-art unsupervised vehicle re-identification
approaches.

composition that was beneficial to improve the fluidity was screened through
the thermodynamic software calculating thermophysical parameters affecting the
fluidity of Ti$_2$AlNb alloy, the numerical simulation test of its fluidity and
the verification test of the fluidity of optimized alloys. Finally, the
improvement mechanism of the alloy fluidity was discussed. Results showed that
the appropriate reduction of Nb element was better than Al element for the
improvement of fluidity. The addition of trace Fe, B and Si elements were
beneficial to the improvement of fluidity, the improvement effect of B element
was best, while the addition of trace Mo, W, Co were not conducive to the
improvement of fluidity. The cessation mechanism of Ti$_2$AlNb alloy is the
cessation mechanism of the alloy with a wide crystallization temperature range.
The composition which was most beneficial to improve the fluidity was
Ti-22Al-24Nb-0.1B. The main reasons for the improvement of the fluidity had two
sides: on the one hand, the reduction of 1at% Nb and the addition of 0.1at% B
not only increased the superheat and crystallization latent heat of the alloy,
but also reduced the melt viscosity and thermal conductivity, thus improving
the fluidity. On the other hand, the TiB phase refined the grains, the fine
grains prevented the dendrite from growing into developed dendrite networks,
inhibited the adverse effect of the increase in the width of the solidification
zone on the fluidity, reduced the flow resistance of the molten metal, and
further improved the fluidity of the alloy.

learning graph-structured data. While numerous approaches have been proposed to
improve GNNs in terms of the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test, generally there is
still a lack of deep understanding of what additional power they can
systematically and provably gain. In this paper, we take a fundamentally
different perspective to study the expressive power of GNNs beyond the WL test.
Specifically, we introduce a novel class of expressivity metrics via graph
biconnectivity and highlight their importance in both theory and practice. As
biconnectivity can be easily calculated using simple algorithms that have
linear computational costs, it is natural to expect that popular GNNs can learn
it easily as well. However, after a thorough review of prior GNN architectures,
we surprisingly find that most of them are not expressive for any of these
metrics. The only exception is the ESAN framework (Bevilacqua et al., 2022),
for which we give a theoretical justification of its power. We proceed to
introduce a principled and more efficient approach, called the Generalized
Distance Weisfeiler-Lehman (GD-WL), which is provably expressive for all
biconnectivity metrics. Practically, we show GD-WL can be implemented by a
Transformer-like architecture that preserves expressiveness and enjoys full
parallelizability. A set of experiments on both synthetic and real datasets
demonstrates that our approach can consistently outperform prior GNN
architectures.

the optical flow and guide the network to focus on motion details. Meanwhile,
we propose a homography decoder module (HD) to combine gyro field and

allow the design of very compact devices by exploiting guiding through sharp

valley-topological triangular resonators coupled to an input waveguide to
evaluate the quality of the topological protection. To that purpose, we analyze
via numerical simulations the existence of backward scattering at cavity
corners or transmission with pseudo-spin conversion at the splitter between the
input waveguide and the cavity. We evidence that a breakdown of topological
protection takes place, in particular at sharp corners, which results in
transmission minima and split-resonances, otherwise non-existent. In order to
evaluate the small coupling coefficients associated to this breakdown, a
phenomenological model based on an ad hoc parameterization of scattering
matrices at splitters and corners of the resonators is introduced. By
comparison with the numerical simulations, we are able to quantify the loss of
topological protection at sharp bends and splitters. Finally, varying the
coupling rate between the input waveguide and the cavity by introducing a small
gap allows reaching quality factors on the order of 10^4 to 10^6 . Our results
suggest that even in a perfectly ordered system, topological protection is not
complete at corners, sharp bends and splitters, which is crucial to design
photonic devices which gather compactness and low losses through topological

Merge: Ethereum blockchain's transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to
proof-of-stake (PoS), a fraction of the Ethereum ecosystem announced plans of
continuing with a PoW-chain. Owners of ETH - whether their ETH was borrowed or
not - would hold the native tokens on each chain. This development alarmed
lending protocols. They feared spiking ETH borrowing rates would lead to mass
liquidations which could undermine their viability. Thus, the decentralized
autonomous organization running the protocols saw no alternative to
intervention - restricting users' ability to borrow.
  We investigate the effects of the merge and the intervention on the two
biggest lending protocols on Ethereum: AAVE and Compound. Our analysis finds
that borrowing rates were extremely volatile, jumping by two orders of
magnitude, and borrowing at times reached 100% of the available funds. Despite
this, no spike in mass liquidations or irretrievable loans materialized.
Further, we are the first to quantify and analyze hard-fork-arbitrage,

We find that arbitrageurs made 13 Mio US$, money that was effectively extracted

  Finally, we identify alarming security risks to the entire Ethereum

it is reported that 34% of the organizations stated that employees who are
inattentive or do not have the necessary knowledge are the principal
vulnerabilities of cybersecurity, and 22% of the organizations indicated that
phishing is the main threat to them. Inattentive users are one of the reasons
for data breaches and cyberattacks. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)

desired distribution over an infinite horizon. This is an optimal transport
problem over dynamical systems, which is challenging due to its high
computational cost. In this paper, by using entropy regularization, we propose
Sinkhorn MPC, which is a dynamical transport algorithm integrating model
predictive control (MPC) and the so-called Sinkhorn algorithm. The notable
feature of the proposed method is that it achieves cost-effective transport in
real time by performing control and transport planning simultaneously, which is
illustrated in numerical examples. Moreover, under some assumption on
iterations of the Sinkhorn algorithm integrated in MPC, we reveal the global
convergence property for Sinkhorn MPC thanks to the entropy regularization.
Furthermore, focusing on a quadratic control cost, without the aforementioned
assumption we show the ultimate boundedness and the local asymptotic stability
for Sinkhorn MPC.

described by the quantum metric of the valence band Bloch state, has been an
intriguing issue owing to its connection to various material properties.
Because the Brillouin zone is periodic, the integration of quantum metric over
momentum space represents an average distance between neighboring Bloch states,
of which we call the fidelity number. We show that this number can further be
expressed in real space as a fidelity marker, which is a local quantity that
can be calculated directly from diagonalizing the lattice Hamiltonian. A linear
response theory is further introduced to generalize the fidelity number and
marker to finite temperature, and moreover demonstrates that they can be
measured from the global and local optical absorption power against linearly
polarized light. In particular, the fidelity number spectral function in 2D
systems can be easily measured from the opacity of the material. Based on the
divergence of quantum metric, a nonlocal fidelity marker is further introduced
and postulated as a universal indicator of any quantum phase transitions
provided the crystalline momentum remains a good quantum number, and it may be
interpreted as a Wannier state correlation function. The ubiquity of these
concepts is demonstrated for a variety of topological insulators and
topological phase transitions in different dimensions.

distance-based metrics on very large graphs such as the (effective) diameter,
the (effective) radius, or the average distance within a small error. The
framework assigns seeds to nodes and propagates them in a BFS-like fashion,
computing the neighbors set until we obtain either the whole vertex set (the
diameter) or a given percentage (the effective diameter). At each iteration, we
derive compressed Boolean representations of the neighborhood sets discovered
so far. The PROPAGATE framework yields two algorithms: PROPAGATE-P, which
propagates all the $s$ seeds in parallel, and PROPAGATE-s which propagates the
seeds sequentially. For each node, the compressed representation of the
PROPAGATE-P algorithm requires $s$ bits while that of PROPAGATE-S only $1$ bit.
Both algorithms compute the average distance, the effective diameter, the
diameter, and the connectivity rate within a small error with high probability:
for any $\varepsilon>0$ and using $s=\Theta\left(\frac{\log
n}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ sample nodes, the error for the average distance is
bounded by $\xi = \frac{\varepsilon \Delta}{\alpha}$, the error for the
effective diameter and the diameter are bounded by $\xi =
\frac{\varepsilon}{\alpha}$, and the error for the connectivity rate is bounded
by $\varepsilon$ where $\Delta$ is the diameter and $\alpha$ is a measure of
connectivity of the graph. The time complexity is $\mathcal{O}\left(m\Delta

electrons passing through two slits form an interference pattern on the

introduced behind the slits between the two electron beams, an extra phase
difference between them appears, as shown by a shift in the interference
pattern. This happens even though there is no magnetic field outside the
solenoid, at the location of the beams. This mysterious effect, purportedly
arises owing to an electromagnetic momentum, attributed to the presence at the
location of either beam, a vector potential due to the solenoid of current even
when there exists no magnetic field outside the solenoid. The first
experimental confirmation came soon and It has since been amply verified using
clever experimental setups, leaving hardly any doubts that the observed effect
is real. However, on the theoretical side the picture is not so clear and a
satisfactory physical explanation of the existence of momentum, at least under
the aegis of classical electromagnetism, is still missing since inception of
the idea more than half a century back. It has remained a puzzle, how just
potential can give rise to an electromagnetic momentum in a system. We here
show that a subtle momentum can be seen to lie in the product of the drift
velocities of the current carrying charges and the mass equivalent of their
non-localized potential energies in the electric field of the interfering
electrons, which manifests, from a classical point of view, a linear momentum
in the system. It is this hard-to-pinpoint, additional momentum, reflected
through an extra phase difference between the interfering beams of electrons,
which exhibits from a classical physics perspective, the presence of an
elusive, long sought-after electromagnetic momentum in the system.

the computational research community for its simple and easy-to-learn coding
interface. As a result, MATLAB is generally preferred for the initial
development (prototyping) of computational models by researchers. However,
MATLAB-developed codes are seldom used for large-scale simulations (after
initial development is complete) due to their computational inefficiency.
Hence, a computationally efficient implementation of LGDM using MATLAB
vectorization is presented in this work. The choice of LGDM (as the fracture
modeling method) is based on its thermodynamically consistent formulation built
upon the micromorphic framework. Moreover, the non-linear coupled field
formulation of LGDM makes it suitable for testing the computational efficiency
of vectorized MATLAB implementation in a non-linear finite element setting. It
is shown in this work that the vectorized MATLAB implementation can save
significant computational resources and time as compared to non-vectorized
implementations (that are parallelized with MATLAB parfor). The vectorized
MATLAB implementation is tested by solving numerical problems in 1D, 2D and 3D
on a consumer-grade PC, demonstrating the capability of vectorized
implementation to run simulations efficiently on systems with limited
resources. The sample source codes are provided as supplementary materials that

generalizability to new environments that enables a mobile robot to navigate
autonomously through spaces filled with both static obstacles and dense crowds
of pedestrians. The policy uses a unique combination of input data to generate
the desired steering angle and forward velocity: a short history of lidar data,
kinematic data about nearby pedestrians, and a sub-goal point. The policy is
trained in a reinforcement learning setting using a reward function that
contains a novel term based on velocity obstacles to guide the robot to
actively avoid pedestrians and move towards the goal. Through a series of 3D
simulated experiments with up to 55 pedestrians, this control policy is able to
achieve a better balance between collision avoidance and speed (i.e., higher
success rate and faster average speed) than state-of-the-art model-based and
learning-based policies, and it also generalizes better to different crowd
sizes and unseen environments. An extensive series of hardware experiments
demonstrate the ability of this policy to directly work in different real-world
environments with different crowd sizes with zero retraining. Furthermore, a
series of simulated and hardware experiments show that the control policy also
works in highly constrained static environments on a different robot platform
without any additional training. Lastly, several important lessons that can be
applied to other robot learning systems are summarized. Multimedia

solve a joint optimization problem that explicitly considers the balance

particularly the magnetic field and non-thermal electron population entrained
in the CME plasma, are crucial to understand their propagation, evolution, and
geo-effectiveness. Spectral modeling of gyrosynchrotron (GS) emission from CME
plasma has been regarded as one of the most promising remote sensing technique
for estimating spatially resolved CME plasma parameters. Imaging the very low
flux density CME GS emission in close proximity to the Sun with orders of
magnitude higher flux density, however, has proven to be rather challenging.
This challenge has only recently been met using the high dynamic range imaging
capability of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). Although routine detection
of GS is now within reach, the challenge has shifted to constraining the large
number of free parameters in GS models, a few of which are degenerate, using
the limited number of spectral points at which the observations are typically
available. These degeneracies can be broken using polarimetric imaging. For the
first time, we demonstrate this using our recently developed capability of high
fidelity polarimetric imaging on the data from the MWA. We show that
spectro-polarimetric imaging, even when only sensitive upper limits on
circularly polarization flux density are available, is not only able to break
the degeneracies, but also yields tighter constraints on the plasma parameters
of key interest than possible with total intensity spectroscopic imaging alone.

strange metals, understanding the highly unconventional behaviors has been a
long-standing challenge. Fundamental aspects of strange metals remain elusive,
including the nature of their charge carriers[1]. Here, we report the
observation of a giant Nernst response in the strange-metal state in a
two-dimensional superconductor 2M-WS2. A giant Nernst coefficient comparable to
the vortex Nernst signal in superconducting cuprates, and its high sensitivity
to carrier mobility, are found when the system enters the strange-metal state
from the Fermi liquid state. The temperature and magnetic field dependence of
the giant Nernst peak rule out the relevance of both Landau quasiparticles and
superconductivity. Instead, the giant Nernst peak at the crossover indicates a
dramatic change in carrier entropy when entering the strange-metal state. The
presence of such an anomalous Nernst response is further confirmed in other
iconic strange metals, suggesting its universality and places stringent
experimental constraints on the mechanism of strange metals.

increasing influence of impact shock from pristine LL5 (or LL6) material (which

and a faint companion. Due to its surface chemical abundances, the red giant
was classified as a barium (Ba) star. This implies that the companion has to be
a white dwarf, since Ba stars form when mass is transferred to them from an
s-process rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star. However, in the case of 56
UMa, the companion might be too massive to be the progeny of an AGB star that
efficiently produced s-process elements such as barium. In this Letter, we
revisit the orbital parameters of the system and perform a full spectral
analysis with the goal of investigating the Ba-star classification of the giant
and unravelling the nature of its faint companion. We combined radial-velocity
and astrometric data to refine the orbital parameters of the system, including
the orbital inclination and the companion mass. Then, we re-determined the
stellar parameters of the giant and its chemical abundances using
high-resolution HERMES spectra. Finally, we investigated the morphology of the
interstellar gas in the vicinity of the system. The faint component in 56 UMa
has a mass of $1.31 \pm 0.12$ M$_{\odot}$, which, together with the mixed s+r
abundance profile of the red giant, confirms that the giant is not a standard
barium star. Additionally, the clear identification of a cavity surrounding 56
UMa could indicate that a supernova explosion occurred about 10 5 years ago in
the system, suggesting that the faint companion might be a neutron star.
However, finding an evolutionary scenario that explains all the observables is
not trivial, so we discuss different possible configurations of the system and
their respective merits.

  lasers","18 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.optics cond-mat.dis-nn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Exceptional points, that are spectral degeneracies in the parameter space of
non-Hermitian systems, have evoked a massive interest in the optical domain
owing to their striking consequences on optical behavior of commonly known
systems. Through careful engineering of gain and loss, exceptional points have
been demonstrated in a variety of photonic systems ranging from optical fibers
to chaotic cavities, exhibiting extra-ordinary phenomena and augmented
functionalities. However, in the domain of disordered systems, there are still
no realizations of exceptional points even though mode-coupling and
non-Hermitian behavior is amply demonstrated. The obvious challenge lies in the
probabilistic nature of disorder, which is a difficult candidate for parametric
control. Here, we exploit the probabilistic nature of Anderson localizing
systems by implementing thousands of disorder configurations. We demonstrate
statistical occurrences of lasing over exceptional points. Our route towards
exceptional points begins with detection of quantum echoes, which are temporal
signatures of coupling between modes. Quantum echoes unambiguously set apart
two coupled modes from a pair of two isolated modes that are spectrally close
perchance. Simultaneous temporal, spectral and spatial investigations provide
corroborative evidence of the convergence of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in
the approach to the exceptional points. Ultimately, the vanishing of the echo
and coalescence of spectral peaks and spatial intensity distributions,
accompanied by the square-Lorentzian lineshape of lasing peaks, identify the
exceptional point, at which the lasing intensity is seen to be significantly
higher.

Processes for regression on unknown manifolds with probabilistic metrics (GPUM)
in point clouds. In many real world applications, one often encounters high
dimensional data (e.g. point cloud data) centred around some lower dimensional
unknown manifolds. The geometry of manifold is in general different from the
usual Euclidean geometry. Naively applying traditional smoothing methods such
as Euclidean Gaussian Processes (GPs) to manifold valued data and so ignoring
the geometry of the space can potentially lead to highly misleading predictions
and inferences. A manifold embedded in a high dimensional Euclidean space can
be well described by a probabilistic mapping function and the corresponding
latent space. We investigate the geometrical structure of the unknown manifolds
using the Bayesian Gaussian Processes latent variable models(BGPLVM) and
Riemannian geometry. The distribution of the metric tensor is learned using
BGPLVM. The boundary of the resulting manifold is defined based on the
uncertainty quantification of the mapping. We use the the probabilistic metric
tensor to simulate Brownian Motion paths on the unknown manifold. The heat
kernel is estimated as the transition density of Brownian Motion and used as
the covariance functions of GPUM. The applications of GPUM are illustrated in
the simulation studies on the Swiss roll, high dimensional real datasets of
WiFi signals and image data examples. Its performance is compared with the
Graph Laplacian GP, Graph Matern GP and Euclidean GP.

Case-Base Neural Networks (CBNN) as a new approach that combines the case-base
sampling framework with flexible architectures. Our method naturally accounts
for censoring and does not require method specific hyperparameters. Using a
novel sampling scheme and data augmentation, we incorporate time directly into
a feed-forward neural network. CBNN predicts the probability of an event
occurring at a given moment and estimates the hazard function. We compare the
performance of CBNN to survival methods based on regression and neural networks
in two simulations and two real data applications. We report two time-dependent
metrics for each model. In the simulations and real data applications, CBNN
provides a more consistent predictive performance across time and outperforms
the competing neural network approaches. For a simple simulation with an
exponential hazard model, CBNN outperforms the other neural network methods.
For a complex simulation, which highlights the ability of CBNN to model both a
complex baseline hazard and time-varying interactions, CBNN outperforms all
competitors. The first real data application shows CBNN outperforming all
neural network competitors, while a second real data application shows
competitive performance. We highlight the benefit of combining case-base

evaluate the health of the heart. Reliable automatic interpretation of ECG
records is crucial to the goal of improving public health. It can enable a safe
inexpensive monitoring. This work presents a new methodology for morphological
identification of heartbeats, which is placed outside the usual machine
learning framework. The proposal considers the sparsity of the representation
of a heartbeat as a parameter for morphological identification. The approach
involves greedy algorithms for selecting elements from redundant dictionaries,
which should be previously learnt from examples of the classes to be
identified. Using different metrics of sparsity, the dictionary rendering the
smallest sparsity value, for the equivalent approximation quality of a new
heartbeat, classifies the morphology of that beat. This study focuses on a
procedure of learning the dictionaries for representing heartbeats and compares
several metrics of sparsity for morphological identification on the basis of
those metrics. The suitability of the method is illustrated by binary
differentiation of Normal and Ventricular heartbeats in the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia
data set. In general classification 99.7% of the Normal beats and 97.6% of the
Ventricular beats in the testing sets are correctly identified. In interpatient
assessment 91.8% of the Normal beats and 91.0% of Ventricular beats are
correctly identified. Even more important than these scores is the fact that
they are produced on the bases of a single parameter. The numerical tests,
designed to emphasise the interpretability and reliability of the approach,
demonstrate the potential of the method to contribute towards the development
of a well grounded expert system for classification of heartbeats in ECG

the original DE formula requires knowledge of the nonlinear state equation,
which is not available in many practical applications. In this paper, the DE
formula is extended to a data-driven method, Data-Driven Encoding (DDE) of
Koopman operator, in which the inner products are calculated from data taken
from a nonlinear dynamic system. An effective algorithm is presented for the
computation of the inner products, and their convergence to true values is
proven. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of DDE compared to
Extended DMD. The experiments demonstrate robustness to data distribution and
the convergent properties of DDE, guaranteeing accuracy improvements with
additional sample points. Furthermore, DDE is applied to deep learning of the

design and discovery. However, the identification of stable and synthesizable
HEMs and robust design rules remains a daunting challenge due to the difficulty
in determining composition/structure-specific enthalpy and entropy
contributions to the stability and formation of HEMs. In this work, using
first-principles calculations, we find that (i) the stability and miscibility
of HEMs strongly depend on the formation enthalpy of the HEM relative to the
most stable completing phase rather than on the conventionally-viewed
enthalpies of mixing over all possible competing phases, and (ii) the entropy
forming ability of a HEM can be measured from the defect formation energy
spectrum of tens of substitutional defects in ordered binary compounds,
involving no sampling over numerous alloy configurations. Based on these
findings, we propose a highly predictive Mixed Enthalpy-Entropy Descriptor
(MEED), which enables the rational high-throughput first-principles design and
screening of new HEMs over large chemical spaces. Applying the MEED to two
structurally distinct material systems (i.e., 3D rocksalt carbides and 2D
layered sulfides), not only all experimentally reported HEMs within each system
are successfully identified, but a universal cutoff criterion for assessing
their relative synthesizability also revealed. In addition, tens of new high
entropy carbides and 2D high-entropy sulfides are also predicted. They have the
potential for a wide variety of applications such as coating in aerospace
devices, energy conversion and storage, and flexible electronics.

particular cognitive processes such as awareness, embodiment, and
predictability that contribute to ErrP variations. In this paper, we explore
the performance of classifier transferability when trained on different ErrP
variation datasets generated by varying the levels of awareness and embodiment

photoionized material is allowed to outflow at $\approx 500$ km s$^{-1}$,
matching the outflow velocity of the forbidden O{\sc vii} emission line. From
constraints on the ionization and density of the photoionized material we can
estimate the location of it to be no further than a few pc from the central

the asymptotic values of the fluid quantities and a sample of hairy black holes

region expanded by a factor of 1.3 of the neutrino event IC-211208A, was found
to be flaring in multi-frequency wavebands at the time of detection by IceCube
Observatory. In addition to leptonic synchrotron (SYN) and synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) emission, we invoke photohadronic (p$\gamma$) interactions
inside the jet to model the spectral energy distribution (SED) and neutrino
emission. We analyze the long-term $\gamma$-ray and X-ray data to generate the
broadband SED. The temporal light curve indicates that the source was in a high
state in optical UV, $\gamma$-ray, and X-ray range during the neutrino
detection epoch. In the one-zone lepto-hadronic model, the SSC photons do not
provide enough seed photons for p$\gamma$ interactions to explain the neutrino
event. However, including an external photon field yields a neutrino event rate
of 0.2 in 100 days, for the IceCube detector, for physically motivated values
of the magnetic field, an external photon field peaking at optical wavelength,
and other jet parameters without exceeding the Eddington luminosity. The
radiation from secondary electrons at X-ray energies severely constrains the
neutrino flux to a lower value than found in previous studies. In contrast, the
pion decay cascade flux at GeV energies is subdominant at the high-energy peak
of the SED, suggesting a higher correlation of neutrinos with X-ray emission is
plausible.

copious electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational waves. One of their most
promising EM signatures is the lightcurve modulation caused by a strong, unique
and extended azimuthal overdensity structure orbiting at the inner edge of the
circumbinary disc (CBD), dubbed ""lump"". In this paper, we investigate the
origin of this structure using 2D general-relativistic (GR) hydrodynamical
simulations of a CBD in an approximate BBH spacetime. First, we use the
symmetric mass-ratio case to study the transition from the natural m = 2 mode
to m = 1. The asymmetry with respect to m = 2 grows exponentially, pointing to
an instability origin. We indeed find that the CBD edge is prone to a
(magneto-)hydrodynamical instability owing to the disc edge density sharpness:
the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI). The RWI criterion is naturally fullfilled at
the CBD edge and we report the presence of vortices, which are typical
structures of the RWI. The RWI is also at work in the asymmetric mass-ratio
cases (from 0.1 to 0.5). However, the CBD edge sharpness decreases with a
decreasing mass ratio, and so the lump. By proposing a scenario for this lump
formation, our work further supports its existence in astrophysical CBDs and
potential source for an EM signature of BBHs. Finally, because the RWI is not
caused by GR effects, it is also a robust candidate for the lump origin in CBDs
around non-compact objects, e.g. binary protostars.

the robust assumption that surface water is flat as gravity always pulls liquid
molecules down. Based on this natural law, the proposed method extracts

records is increasingly used to extract patient characteristics otherwise not
or only partly available, to assess their association with relevant health
outcomes. As manual data labeling needed to develop text mining models is
resource intensive, we investigated whether off-the-shelf text mining models
developed at external institutions, together with limited within-institution
labeled data, could be used to reliably extract study variables to conduct
association studies.
  Materials and Methods: We developed multiple text mining models on different
combinations of within-institution and external-institution data to extract
social factors from discharge reports of intensive care patients. Subsequently,
we assessed the associations between social factors and having a
do-not-resuscitate/intubate code. Results: Important differences were found
between associations based on manually labeled data compared to text-mined
social factors in three out of five cases. Adopting external-institution text
mining models using manually labeled within-institution data resulted in models
with higher F1-scores, but not in meaningfully different associations.
  Discussion: While text mining facilitated scaling analyses to larger samples
leading to discovering a larger number of associations, the estimates may be
unreliable. Confirmation is needed with better text mining models, ideally on a
larger manually labeled dataset.
  Conclusion: The currently used text mining models were not sufficiently
accurate to be used reliably in an association study. Model adaptation using
within-institution data did not improve the estimates. Further research is
needed to set conditions for reliable use of text mining in medical research.

and discuss a one-to-one mapping of the quantum state in a two-dimensional
Hilbert space to a vector in an eight dimensional probability space
(probability simplex). We then show how the usual transformations of the
quantum state, specifically the Hadamard gate and the single-qubit phase gate,
can be accomplished with appropriate transformations of the mapped vector in
the probability simplex. One key defining feature of both the mapping to the
simplex and the transformations in the simplex is that they are not linear.
These results show that both the initial state and the time evolution of a
qubit can be fully captured in an eight dimensional probability simplex (or
equivalently using three classical probabilistic bits). We then discuss
multi-partite quantum systems and their mapping to the probability simplex.
Here, the key tool is the identical tensor product structure of combining
multiple quantum systems as well as multiple probability spaces. Specifically,
we explicitly show how to implement an analog of the two-qubit controlled-not
(CNOT) gate in the simplex. We leave it an open problem how much the quantum
dynamics of $N$ qubits can be captured in a probability simplex with $3N$
classical probabilistic bits. Finally, we also discuss the equivalent of the
Schrodinger's equation for the wavefunction (in a Hilbert space of arbitrary
dimension), which dictates the time evolution of the vectors in the simplex.

generative model that is able to learn a Granger causal graph from a
multivariate time series x and incorporates the underlying causal mechanism
into its data generation process. Distinct to the classical recurrent VAEs, our
CR-VAE uses a multi-head decoder, in which the $p$-th head is responsible for
generating the $p$-th dimension of $\mathbf{x}$ (i.e., $\mathbf{x}^p$). By
imposing a sparsity-inducing penalty on the weights (of the decoder) and
encouraging specific sets of weights to be zero, our CR-VAE learns a sparse
adjacency matrix that encodes causal relations between all pairs of variables.
Thanks to this causal matrix, our decoder strictly obeys the underlying
principles of Granger causality, thereby making the data generating process
transparent. We develop a two-stage approach to train the overall objective.
Empirically, we evaluate the behavior of our model in synthetic data and two
real-world human brain datasets involving, respectively, the
electroencephalography (EEG) signals and the functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) data. Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art time
series generative models both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, it
also discovers a faithful causal graph with similar or improved accuracy over

exoplanets is key to understanding their atmospheric properties. Exoplanetary
atmospheric retrievals are usually based on approximate Bayesian inference and
rely on sampling-based approaches to compute parameter posterior distributions.
Accurate or repeated retrievals, however, can result in very long computation
times due to the sequential nature of sampling-based algorithms. We aim to
amortize exoplanetary atmospheric retrieval using neural posterior estimation
(NPE), a simulation-based inference algorithm based on variational inference
and normalizing flows. In this way, we aim (i) to strongly reduce inference
time, (ii) to scale inference to complex simulation models with many nuisance
parameters or intractable likelihood functions, and (iii) to enable the
statistical validation of the inference results. We evaluate NPE on a radiative
transfer model for exoplanet spectra petitRADTRANS, including the effects of
scattering and clouds. We train a neural autoregressive flow to quickly
estimate posteriors and compare against retrievals computed with MultiNest. NPE
produces accurate posterior approximations while reducing inference time down
to a few seconds. We demonstrate the computational faithfulness of our
posterior approximations using inference diagnostics including posterior
predictive checks and coverage, taking advantage of the quasi-instantaneous
inference time of NPE. Our analysis confirms the reliability of the approximate
posteriors produced by NPE. The accuracy and reliability of the inference
results produced by NPE establishes it as a promising approach for atmospheric
retrievals. Amortization of the posterior inference makes repeated inference on
several observations computationally inexpensive since it does not require
on-the-fly simulations, making the retrieval efficient, scalable, and testable.

  Open-Source Project Health Prediction",,,,,"cs.SE cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When learning from very small data sets, the resulting models can make many
mistakes. For example, consider learning predictors for open source project
health. The training data for this task may be very small (e.g. five years of
data, collected every month means just 60 rows of training data). Using this
data, prior work had unacceptably large errors in their learned predictors. We
show that these high errors rates can be tamed by better configuration of the
control parameters of the machine learners. For example, we present here a {\em
landscape analytics} method (called SNEAK)
  that (a)~clusters the data to find the general landscape of the
hyperparameters; then
  (b)~explores a few representatives from each part of that landscape.
  SNEAK is both
  faster and and more effective than
  prior state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization algorithms (FLASH,
HYPEROPT, OPTUNA, and differential evolution). More importantly, the
configurations found by SNEAK had far less error that other methods.
  We conjecture that SNEAK works so well since it finds the most informative
regions of the hyperparameters, then jumps to those regions. Other methods
(that do not reflect over the landscape) can waste time exploring less
informative options.
  From this, we make the following conclusions. Firstly, for predicting open
source project health, we recommend landscape analytics (e.g.SNEAK). Secondly,
and more generally, when learning from very small data sets, using
hyperparameter optimization (e.g. SNEAK) to select learning control parameters.
Due to its speed and implementation simplicity, we suggest SNEAK might also be
useful in other ``data-light'' SE domains.

ionosphere is one of the crucial coupling mechanisms between these two regions
of geospace and is associated with multiple space weather effects, such as
global navigation satellite system signal disruption and geomagnetically
induced currents at ground level. While precipitating particle fluxes have been
measured by numerous spacecraft missions over the past decades, it often
remains difficult to obtain global precipitation patterns with a good time
resolution during a substorm. Numerical simulations can help to bridge this gap
and improve the understanding of mechanisms leading to particle precipitation
at high latitudes through the global view they offer on the near-Earth space
system. We present the first results on auroral (0.5-50 keV) proton
precipitation within a 3-dimensional simulation of the Vlasiator hybrid-Vlasov
model. The run is driven by southward interplanetary magnetic field conditions
with constant solar wind parameters. We find that, on the dayside, cusp proton
precipitation exhibits the expected energy-latitude dispersion and takes place
in the form of successive bursts associated with the transit of flux transfer
events formed through dayside magnetopause reconnection. On the nightside, the
precipitation takes place within the expected range of geomagnetic latitudes,
and it appears clearly that the precipitating particle injection is taking
place within a narrow magnetic local time span, associated with fast Earthward
plasma flows in the near-Earth magnetotail. Finally, the simulated
precipitating fluxes are compared to observations from Defense Meteorological
Satellite Program spacecraft during driving conditions similar to those in the
simulation and are found to be in good agreement with the measurements.

wavelet space with a matrix-free multigrid for Boltzmann transport problems.
This method scalably mapped to the underlying P$^0$ space during every
matrix-free matrix-vector product, however the multigrid method itself was not
scalable in the streaming limit.
  To tackle this we recently built an iterative method based on using an ideal
restriction multigrid with frozen GMRES polynomials (AIRG) for Boltzmann
transport that showed scalable work with uniform P$^0$ angle in the streaming
and scattering limits. This paper details the practical requirements of using
this new iterative method with angular adaptivity. Hence we modify our angular
adaptivity to occur directly in P$^0$ space, rather than the Haar space. We
then develop a modified stabilisation term for our FEM method that results in
scalable growth in the number of non-zeros in the streaming operator with P$^0$
adaptivity. We can therefore combine the use of this iterative method with
P$^0$ angular adaptivity to solve problems in both the scattering and streaming
limits, with close to fixed work and memory use.
  We also present a CF splitting for multigrid methods based on element
agglomeration combined with angular adaptivity, that can produce a
semi-coarsening in the streaming limit without access to the matrix entries.
The equivalence between our adapted P$^0$ and Haar wavelet spaces also allows
us to introduce a robust convergence test for our iterative method when using
regular adaptivity. This allows the early termination of the solve in each
adapt step, reducing the cost of producing an adapted angular discretisation.

radio architectures, require standardised over-the-air data transmission, or

protocols and hardware creates a problematic case, since this diversity
requires to design or update the calibration procedures for each new advanced

alternative way, namely as a task of functional approximation, and address it
via Bayesian machine learning. Our contributions are three-fold. Firstly, we
define a parameter space, based on near-field measurements, that captures the
underlying hardware impairments corresponding to each radiating element, their
positional offsets, as well as the mutual coupling effects between antenna
elements. Secondly, Gaussian process regression is used to form models from a
sparse set of the aforementioned near-field data. Once deployed, the learned
non-parametric models effectively serve to continuously transform the
beamforming weights of the system, resulting in corrected beam patterns.
Lastly, we demonstrate the viability of the described methodology for both
digital and analog beamforming antenna arrays of different scales and discuss
its further extension to support real-time operation with dynamic hardware
impairments.

the turbulent velocity field, the so-called triad interactions, offers a unique
way of visualizing and describing turbulence. Most often, this study has been
carried out by Direct Numerical Simulations or by power spectral measurements.
Due to the complexity of the problem and the great range of velocity scales in
high Reynolds number developed turbulence, direct measurements of the
interaction between the individual wave components have been rare. In the
present work, we therefore present measurements and related computer
simulations of triad interactions between controlled wave components injected
into an approximately laminar and uniform flow from an open wind tunnel by
vortex shedding from two rods suspended into the flow. This well-defined vortex
shedding approximates well a two-dimensional flow, which makes the analysis of
the triadic interactions considerably less complex to analyze than in a fully
developed spatially three-dimensional flow. With the information obtained from
the simulations, we are hereby able to isolate and display the individual triad
interactions taking place as the flow develops downstream as well as the

(graph) is governed by the graph braid group, which can be strikingly different
from the standard braid group known from two-dimensional physics. It has been
recently shown that imposing the compatibility of graph braiding with anyon
fusion for anyons exchanging at a single wire junction leads to new types of
anyon models with the braiding exchange operators stemming from solutions of
certain generalised hexagon equations. In this work, we establish these
graph-braided anyon fusion models for general wire networks. We show that the
character of braiding strongly depends on the graph-theoretic connectivity of
the given network. In particular, we prove that triconnected networks yield the
same braiding exchange operators as the planar anyon models. In contrast,
modular biconnected networks support independent braiding exchange operators in
different modules. Consequently, such modular networks may lead to more
efficient topological quantum computer circuits. Finally, we conjecture that
the graph-braided anyon fusion models will possess the (generalised) coherence
property where certain polygon equations determine the braiding exchange
operators for an arbitrary number of anyons. We also extensively study
solutions to these polygon equations for chosen low-rank fusion rings,
including the Ising theory, quantum double of groups, and Tambara-Yamagami
models. We find numerous solutions that do not appear in the planar theory of
anyons.

shape into prescribed 3D shapes without an external stimulus such as mechanical
loads or heat. To achieve control over the target shape, two different concepts
are coupled. First, motivated by biological growth, strain mismatch is applied
between the flat composite layers to transform it into a 3D shape. Depending on
the amount of the applied strain mismatch, the transformation involves buckling
into one of the available finite number of mode shapes. Second, inspired by
kirigami, portions of the material are removed from one of the layers according
to a specific pattern. This dramatically increases the number of possible 3D
shapes and allows us to attain specific topologies. We devise an experimental
apparatus that allows precise control of the strain mismatch. An inverse
problem is posed, where starting from a given target shape, the physical
parameters that make these shapes possible are determined. To show how the
concept works, we focus on circular composite plates and design a kirigami
pattern that yields a hemispherical structure. Our analysis combines a
theoretical approach with numerical simulations and physical experiments to
understand and predict the transition from 2D to 3D shapes. The tools developed
here can be extended to attain arbitrary 3D shapes. The initially flat shape
suggests that conventional additive manufacturing techniques can be used to
functionalize the soft kirigami composites to fabricate, for example,
deployable 3D shapes, smart skins, and soft electromagnetic metasurfaces.

modify the inflaton potential, which in some cases can induce a transient
period of acceleration. We illustrate this phenomenon in the setup of
non-supersymmetric non-minimal M-flation (non-$\mathbb{M}$-flation) which has
some motivations from the brane compactifications in string theory.
Implementing a lattice simulation by the LATTICEEASY code, we compute the
potential correction term in our scenario and show that the modified term
indeed causes the universe to make a transition from the decelerated expansion
to a temporary phase of acceleration. The correction term reduces to some
extent the number density of the particles generated during preheating, but the
efficiency of preheating remains still enough to have successful particle
production after inflation. We also compute the spectrum of the gravitational
waves (GWs) generated during preheating in our setup by using the LATTICEEASY
code. Although the peak frequency remains almost the same, the inclusion of the
correction term reduces the amplitude of the gravitational spectrum by almost
one order of magnitude.

While this can be easily seen when studying galaxies in relatively isolated
environments, such kind of analysis takes a higher degree of complexity when
cluster galaxies are considered, due to the variety of interactions which can
potentially occur in these denser environments. We use IFU MUSE data from the
GASP survey to study the combined effect of the presence of a stellar bar and
of ram pressure, on spatially resolved properties of stellar populations. We
have analyzed spatially resolved indicators of both recent SFR and average
stellar population ages to check for signatures of anomalous central SF
activity, also taking into account for the possible presence of nuclear
activity. We found an increase of central SFR in ram pressure affected galaxies
when compared with unperturbed ones. The most extreme cases of increase SFR and
central rejuvenation occur in barred galaxies that are at advanced stages of
ram pressure stripping. For low-mass barred galaxies affected by ram pressure,
the combined effect is a systematic enhancement of the star formation activity
as opposed to the case of high-mass galaxies that present both enhancement and
suppression. Barred galaxies that present a suppression of their star formation
activity also present signatures of nuclear activity. Our results indicate that
the combined effect of the presence of a bar and a strong perturbation by ram
pressure is able to trigger the central SF activity and probably ignite nuclear
activity.

often make strong assumptions about the observed features in the data and

to invest in social sustainability issues to seize more market share in today's
competitive business environment. This study aims to develop a coordination
scheme for a manufacturer-retailer supply chain (SC) contributing to social
donation (SD) activity under a cause-related marketing (CRM) campaign. In the
presence of consumer social awareness (CSA), the manufacturer notices consumers
through some activities (i.e. labelling) that he participates in a CRM campaign
by donating a proportion of the retail price to a cause whenever a consumer
makes a purchase. In this study, the market demand depends on the retail price,
the retailer's stock level and donation size. The proposed problem is designed
under three decision-making systems. Firstly, a decentralized decision-making
system (traditional structure), where the SC's members aim to optimize their
profits regardless of the other member's profitability, is investigated. Then,
the problem is designed under a centralized decision-making system to obtain
the best values of the retail price and replenishment decisions from the entire
SC perspective. Afterwards, an incentive mechanism based on a cost and
revenue-sharing (RCS) factor is developed in the coordination system to
persuade the SC members to accept the optimal results of the centralized system
without suffering any profit loss. Moreover, the surplus profit obtained in the
centralized system is divided between the members based on their bargaining
power. The numerical investigations and the blocked decision-making on SD
activity are presented to evaluate the proposed model. Not only does the
proposed coordination model increase the SC members' profit, but it is also
desirable in achieving a more socially responsible SC.

challenge which has often been approached within several areas of social, life

information, cost restraints, or the underlying complex network structures,
which define real-world populations. Here, we have extended these models,
including the aforementioned concerns, but also tested the robustness of their
findings to stochastic social learning paradigms. Akin to real-world decisions
on how best to distribute endowments, we study several incentive schemes, which
consider information about the overall population, local neighbourhoods, or the
level of influence which a cooperative node has in the network, selectively
rewarding cooperative behaviour if certain criteria are met. Following a
transition towards a more realistic network setting and stochastic behavioural
update rule, we found that carelessly promoting cooperators can often lead to
their downfall in socially diverse settings. These emergent cyclic patterns not
only damage cooperation, but also decimate the budgets of external investors.
Our findings highlight the complexity of designing effective and cogent
investment policies in socially diverse populations.

which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Active learning addresses such
effort by prioritizing which samples are best to annotate in order to maximize
the performance of the task model. While frameworks for active learning have
been widely explored in the context of classification of natural images, they
have been only sparsely used in medical image segmentation. The challenge
resides in obtaining an uncertainty measure that reveals the best candidate
data for annotation. This paper proposes Test-time Augmentation for Active
Learning (TAAL), a novel semi-supervised active learning approach for
segmentation that exploits the uncertainty information offered by data
transformations. Our method applies cross-augmentation consistency during
training and inference to both improve model learning in a semi-supervised
fashion and identify the most relevant unlabeled samples to annotate next. In
addition, our consistency loss uses a modified version of the JSD to further
improve model performance. By relying on data transformations rather than on
external modules or simple heuristics typically used in uncertainty-based
strategies, TAAL emerges as a simple, yet powerful task-agnostic
semi-supervised active learning approach applicable to the medical domain. Our
results on a publicly-available dataset of cardiac images show that TAAL
outperforms existing baseline methods in both fully-supervised and
semi-supervised settings. Our implementation is publicly available on

speculation that these networks are -- or will soon become -- ""thinking

reasoning. Here, we review the capabilities of LLMs by considering their
performance on two different aspects of language use: 'formal linguistic
competence', which includes knowledge of rules and patterns of a given
language, and 'functional linguistic competence', a host of cognitive abilities
required for language understanding and use in the real world. Drawing on
evidence from cognitive neuroscience, we show that formal competence in humans
relies on specialized language processing mechanisms, whereas functional
competence recruits multiple extralinguistic capacities that comprise human
thought, such as formal reasoning, world knowledge, situation modeling, and
social cognition. In line with this distinction, LLMs show impressive (although
imperfect) performance on tasks requiring formal linguistic competence, but
fail on many tests requiring functional competence. Based on this evidence, we
argue that (1) contemporary LLMs should be taken seriously as models of formal
linguistic skills; (2) models that master real-life language use would need to
incorporate or develop not only a core language module, but also multiple
non-language-specific cognitive capacities required for modeling thought.
Overall, a distinction between formal and functional linguistic competence
helps clarify the discourse surrounding LLMs' potential and provides a path

text, graphs and images requires a form of creative intelligence. Modelling the
generation of layouts has recently gained attention due to its importance in
aesthetics and communication style. In contrast to standard prediction tasks,
there are a range of acceptable layouts which depend on user preferences. For
example, a poster designer may prefer logos on the top-left while another
prefers logos on the bottom-right. Both are correct choices yet existing
machine learning models treat layouts as a single choice prediction problem. In
such situations, these models would simply average over all possible choices
given the same input forming a degenerate sample. In the above example, this
would form an unacceptable layout with a logo in the centre. In this paper, we
present an auto-regressive neural network architecture, called LayoutMCL, that
uses multi-choice prediction and winner-takes-all loss to effectively stabilise
layout generation. LayoutMCL avoids the averaging problem by using multiple
predictors to learn a range of possible options for each layout object. This
enables LayoutMCL to generate multiple and diverse layouts from a single input
which is in contrast with existing approaches which yield similar layouts with
minor variations. Through quantitative benchmarks on real data (magazine,
document and mobile app layouts), we demonstrate that LayoutMCL reduces
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) by 83-98% and generates significantly more
diversity in comparison to existing approaches.

(LAD), quantile loss and Huber's loss, to construct its objective function, in
order to for example eschew the impact of outliers, whereas the difficulty in
analysing the resultant estimators rests on the nonsmoothness of these losses.
Generalized functions have advantages over ordinary functions in several
aspects, especially generalized functions possess derivatives of any order.
Generalized functions incorporate local integrable functions, the so-called
regular generalized functions, while the so-called singular generalized
functions (e.g. Dirac delta function) can be obtained as the limits of a
sequence of sufficient smooth functions, so-called regular sequence in
generalized function context. This makes it possible to use these singular
generalized functions through approximation. Nevertheless, a significant
contribution of this paper is to establish the convergence rate of regular
sequence to nonsmooth loss that answers a call from the relevant literature.
For parameter estimation where objective function may be nonsmooth, this paper
first shows as a general paradigm that how generalized function approach can be
used to tackle the nonsmooth loss functions in Section two using a very simple
model. This approach is of general interest and applicability. We further use
the approach in robust M-estimation for additive single-index cointegrating
time series models; the asymptotic theory is established for the proposed
estimators. We evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed
estimation method and theory by both simulated data and an empirical analysis
of predictive regression of stock returns.

off-the-shelf neural networks pay little attention to the specific choice of
activation functions used. Here we show that data-aware customization of
activation functions can result in striking reductions in neural network error.
We first give a simple linear algebraic explanation of the role of activation
functions in neural networks; then, through connection with the
Diaconis-Shahshahani Approximation Theorem, we propose a set of criteria for
good activation functions. As a case study, we consider regression tasks with a
partially exchangeable target function, \emph{i.e.} $f(u,v,w)=f(v,u,w)$ for
$u,v\in \mathbb{R}^d$ and $w\in \mathbb{R}^k$, and prove that for such a target
function, using an even activation function in at least one of the layers
guarantees that the prediction preserves partial exchangeability for best
performance. Since even activation functions are seldom used in practice, we
designed the ``seagull'' even activation function $\log(1+x^2)$ according to
our criteria. Empirical testing on over two dozen 9-25 dimensional examples
with different local smoothness, curvature, and degree of exchangeability
revealed that a simple substitution with the ``seagull'' activation function in
an already-refined neural network can lead to an order-of-magnitude reduction
in error. This improvement was most pronounced when the activation function
substitution was applied to the layer in which the exchangeable variables are
connected for the first time. While the improvement is greatest for
low-dimensional data, experiments on the CIFAR10 image classification dataset
showed that use of ``seagull'' can reduce error even for high-dimensional
cases. These results collectively highlight the potential of customizing
activation functions as a general approach to improve neural network
performance.

examine the existence of the first overtone in GW150914 from multiple novel
perspectives. First, we confirm that the estimates of the remnant black hole
mass and spin are more consistent with those obtained from the full IMR signal
when including the first overtone at an early stage of the ringdown (right
after the inferred signal peak); such improvement fades away at later times.
Second, we formulate a new way to compare the ringdown models with and without
the first overtone by calculating the Bayes factor at different times during
the ringdown. We obtain a Bayes factor of 600 at the time when the signal
amplitude reaches its peak. The Bayes factor decreases sharply when moving away
from the peak time and eventually oscillates around a small value when the
overtone signal is expected to have decayed. Third, we clean the fundamental
mode from the ringdown of GW150914 and estimate the amplitudes of the modes
using the filtered data with MCMC. The inferred amplitude of the fundamental
mode is ~0 whereas the amplitude of the first overtone remains almost
unchanged, implying that the filtered data is consistent with a
first-overtone-only template. Similarly, if we remove the first overtone from
the GW150914 data, the filtered data are consistent with a
fundamental-mode-only template. Finally, after removing the fundamental mode,
we use MCMC to infer the remnant black hole mass and spin from the first
overtone alone. We find the posteriors are still informative and consistent
with those inferred from the fundamental mode.

this emission measure, the bolometric luminosity of the outbursting object must

distributed on-device learning paradigm. However, multiple challenges remain to
be addressed for deploying FL in real-world Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks
with hierarchies. Although existing works have proposed various approaches to
account data heterogeneity, system heterogeneity, unexpected stragglers and
scalibility, none of them provides a systematic solution to address all of the
challenges in a hierarchical and unreliable IoT network. In this paper, we
propose an asynchronous and hierarchical framework (Async-HFL) for performing
FL in a common three-tier IoT network architecture. In response to the largely
varied delays, Async-HFL employs asynchronous aggregations at both the gateway
and the cloud levels thus avoids long waiting time. To fully unleash the
potential of Async-HFL in converging speed under system heterogeneities and
stragglers, we design device selection at the gateway level and device-gateway
association at the cloud level. Device selection chooses edge devices to
trigger local training in real-time while device-gateway association determines
the network topology periodically after several cloud epochs, both satisfying
bandwidth limitation. We evaluate Async-HFL's convergence speedup using
large-scale simulations based on ns-3 and a network topology from NYCMesh. Our

maximum edge congestion for a set of packets specified by source-destination
vertex pairs. We revisit a semi-oblivious approach to this problem: each
source-destination pair is assigned a small set of predefined paths before the
demand is revealed, while the sending rates along the paths can be optimally
adapted to the demand. This approach has been considered in practice in network
traffic engineering due to its superior robustness and performance as compared
to both oblivious routing and traditional traffic engineering approaches.
  We show the existence of sparse semi-oblivious routings: only $O(\log n)$
paths are selected between each pair of vertices. The routing is $(poly \log
n)$-competitive for all demands against the offline-optimal congestion
objective. Even for the well-studied case of hypercubes, no such result was
known: our deterministic and oblivious selection of $O(\log n)$ paths is the
first simple construction of a deterministic oblivious structure that
near-optimally assigns source-destination pairs to few routes. Our results
contrast the current solely-negative landscape of results for semi-oblivious
routing. We give the sparsity-competitiveness trade-off for lower sparsities
and nearly match it with a lower bound.
  Our construction is extremely simple: Sample the few paths from any
competitive oblivious routing. Indeed, this natural construction was used in
traffic engineering as an unproven heuristic. We give a satisfactory
theoretical justification for their empirical effectiveness: the
competitiveness of the construction improves exponentially with the number of
paths. Finally, when combined with the recent hop-constrained oblivious
routing, we also obtain sparse and competitive structures for the
completion-time objective.

Specifically, we assume the residuals of the base model (i.e., a well-developed

$\mathscr{P}$ includes, as fundamental objects in probability theory, the
family of self-similar Markov semigroups on $\mathbb{R}_+^d$. Relying on the WS

analytical properties of the Bernstein-gamma functions defined from the
associated negative definite functions, and, it is either the point, residual,

statistical difference between the features of OOD and in-distribution (ID)
data extracted by the classifiers. Although many of these schemes have brought

dimension data, has attracted intense attention. In this study, we shed a new
light on graph learning by considering a pragmatic scenario where data are
privacy sensitive and located in separated clients (devices or organizations).
The main difficulty in learning graphs in this scenario is that we cannot
process all the data in a central server, because the data are not allowed to
leave the local clients due to privacy concerns. The problem becomes more
challenging when data of different clients are non-IID, since it is
unreasonable to learn a global graph for heterogeneous data. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework in which a personalized graph for each
client and a consensus graph are jointly learned in a federated fashion.
Specifically, we commute model updates instead of raw data to the central
server in the proposed federated algorithm. A provable convergence analysis
shows that the algorithm enjoys $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ convergence rate. To further
enhance privacy, we design a deferentially privacy algorithm to prevent the
information of the raw data from being leaked when transferring model updates.
A theoretical guidance is provided on how to ensure that the algorithm
satisfies differential privacy. We also analyze the impact of differential
privacy on the convergence of our algorithm. Finally, extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real world data are carried out to validate the proposed
models and algorithms. Experimental results illustrate that our framework is

from robust, with the zero-magnetic field QAH effect only realised at
temperatures an order of magnitude below the N\'eel temperature TN, though
small magnetic fields can stabilize QAH effect. Understanding why topological
protection breaks down is therefore essential to realising QAH effect at higher
temperatures. Here we use a scanning tunnelling microscope to directly map the
size of the exchange gap (Eg,ex) and its spatial fluctuation in the QAH
insulator 5-layer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. We observe long-range fluctuations of Eg,ex
with values ranging between 0 (gapless) and 70 meV, uncorrelated to individual
point defects. We directly image the breakdown of topological protection,
showing that the chiral edge state, the hallmark signature of a QAH insulator,
hybridizes with extended gapless metallic regions in the bulk. Finally, we
unambiguously demonstrate that the gapless regions originate in magnetic
disorder, by demonstrating that a small magnetic field restores Eg,ex in these
regions, explaining the recovery of topological protection in magnetic fields.
Our results indicate that overcoming magnetic disorder is key to exploiting the

However, labeled data, especially high-fidelity labeled data, are usually

paper proposes a pithy deep multi-fidelity model (DMFM) for temperature field

with less high-fidelity data. First, a pre-train and fine-tune paradigm are
developed in DMFM to train the low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, which
significantly reduces the complexity of the deep surrogate model. Then, a
self-supervised learning method for training the physics-driven deep

uncover the mechanism(s) by which CNNs successfully predict the labels. We used
patient sex as a case study to validate our proposed methodology.
  Approach: First, we used a set of 4746 fundus images, including training,
validation and test partitions, to fine-tune a pre-trained CNN on the sex
classification task. Next, we utilized deep learning explainability tools to
hypothesize possible ways sex differences in the retina manifest. We measured
numerous retinal properties relevant to our hypotheses through image

females. To tackle the multiple comparisons problem, we shortlisted the
parameters by testing them on a set of 100 fundus images distinct from the

  Results: We observed that the peripapillary area is darker in males compared
to females ($p=.023, d=.243$). We also observed that males have richer retinal
vasculature networks by showing a higher number of branches ($p=.016, d=.272$)

cross-correlates two cross-polarizations (RR and LL) to estimate the
multi-frequency angular power spectrum (MAPS) $C_{\ell}(\Delta\nu)$. We expect
this to mitigate several effects like noise bias, calibration errors etc.,
which affect the 'Total' TGE which combines the two polarizations. Here we
apply the Cross TGE on a $24.4 \,\rm{MHz}$ bandwidth uGMRT Band $3$ data

Considering the mean squared brightness temperature fluctuations, we report a
$2\sigma$ upper limit $\Delta_{UL}^{2}(k) \le (58.67)^{2} \, {\rm mK}^{2}$ at
$k=0.804 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ which is a factor of $5.2$ improvement on our

simultaneously estimate the foregrounds and $[\Omega_{\rm{HI}} b_{\rm{HI}}] $

tomography (PACT). Recently, deep learning has been used to reconstruct the PA
image with a supervised scheme, which requires high-quality images as ground
truth labels. In practice, there are inevitable trade-offs between cost and
performance since the use of more channels is an expensive strategy to access
more measurements. Here, we propose a cross-domain unsupervised reconstruction
(CDUR) strategy with a pure transformer model, which overcomes the lack of
ground truth labels from limited PA measurements. The proposed approach
exploits the equivariance of PACT to achieve high performance with a smaller
number of channels. We implement a self-supervised reconstruction in a
model-based form. Meanwhile, we also leverage the self-supervision to enforce
the measurement and image consistency on three partitions of measured PA data,
by randomly masking different channels. We find that dynamically masking a high
proportion of the channels, e.g., 80%, yields nontrivial self-supervisors in
both image and signal domains, which decrease the multiplicity of the pseudo
solution to efficiently reconstruct the image from fewer PA measurements with
minimum error of the image. Experimental results on in-vivo PACT dataset of
mice demonstrate the potential of our unsupervised framework. In addition, our
method shows a high performance (0.83 structural similarity index (SSIM) in the

collaborative learning framework for harmonizing and aggregating knowledge from
distributed heterogeneous datasets with partial disease annotations. We
evaluate surgical aggregation across synthetic iid datasets and real-world
large-scale non-iid datasets with partial annotations. Our results indicate

factors when speaking the same sentences. This inherent one-to-many
relationship makes co-speech gesture generation from audio particularly
challenging. Conventional CNNs/RNNs assume one-to-one mapping, and thus tend to
predict the average of all possible target motions, easily resulting in
plain/boring motions during inference. So we propose to explicitly model the
one-to-many audio-to-motion mapping by splitting the cross-modal latent code
into shared code and motion-specific code. The shared code is expected to be
responsible for the motion component that is more correlated to the audio while
the motion-specific code is expected to capture diverse motion information that
is more independent of the audio. However, splitting the latent code into two
parts poses extra training difficulties. Several crucial training
losses/strategies, including relaxed motion loss, bicycle constraint, and
diversity loss, are designed to better train the VAE.
  Experiments on both 3D and 2D motion datasets verify that our method
generates more realistic and diverse motions than previous state-of-the-art
methods, quantitatively and qualitatively. Besides, our formulation is
compatible with discrete cosine transformation (DCT) modeling and other popular
backbones (\textit{i.e.} RNN, Transformer). As for motion losses and
quantitative motion evaluation, we find structured losses/metrics
(\textit{e.g.} STFT) that consider temporal and/or spatial context complement
the most commonly used point-wise losses (\textit{e.g.} PCK), resulting in
better motion dynamics and more nuanced motion details. Finally, we demonstrate

highly excited carriers nonradiatively relax to form a band edge exciton. While
cooling plays an important role in determining the thermal losses and quantum
yield of a system, the timescales and mechanism of cooling are not well
understood in confined semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). A mismatch between
electronic energy gaps and phonon frequencies in NCs has led to the hypothesis
of a phonon bottleneck, in which cooling would be extremely slow, while
enhanced electron-hole interactions in NCs have been used to explain cooling
that would occur on ultrafast timescales. Here, we develop an atomistic
approach for describing phonon-mediated exciton dynamics, and we use it to
simulate hot exciton cooling in NCs of experimentally relevant sizes. Our
framework includes electron-hole correlations as well as multiphonon processes,
both of which are necessary to accurately describe the cooling process. We find
that cooling occurs on timescales of tens of femtoseconds in CdSe cores, in
agreement with experimental measurements, through a cascade of relaxation
events that are mediated by efficient multiphonon emission. Cooling timescales
increase with increasing NC size due to decreased exciton-phonon coupling
(EXPC), and they are an order of magnitude larger in CdSe-CdS core-shell NCs
because of reduced EXPC to low- and mid-frequency acoustic modes.

biology, autoregulation is much less studied. In general, it is extremely
difficult to determine the existence of autoregulation with direct biochemical
approaches. Nevertheless, some papers have observed that certain types of
autoregulations are linked to noise levels in gene expression. We generalize
these results by two propositions on discrete-state continuous-time Markov
chains. These two propositions form a simple but robust method to infer the
existence of autoregulation in certain scenarios from gene expression data.
This method only depends on the Fano factor, namely the ratio of variance and
mean of the gene expression level. Compared to other methods for inferring
autoregulation, our method only requires non-interventional one-time data, and
does not need to estimate parameters. Besides, our method has few restrictions

some genes that might have autoregulation. Some inferred autoregulations have

main-sequence star-forming galaxy population at these redshifts, while the
$z\sim5.6$ and $z\sim7.5$ samples are likely biased toward high specific

that each subsample at $z=2.0-6.5$ falls on the same excitation sequence in the

the sequences followed by $z=0$ HII regions in the same diagrams. The direction
of these offsets are consistent with high-redshift star-forming galaxies

algorithmic scope is broader than any single domain. To that end, we design,
develop, and deploy a comprehensive 3D rendering engine programmed entirely in
Ethereum smart contracts, called Shackled. Shackled computes a 2D image from a
3D scene, executing every single computation on-chain, on Ethereum. To our
knowledge, Shackled is the first and only fully on-chain 3D rendering engine
for Ethereum. In this work, we 1) provide three unique datasets for the purpose
of using and benchmarking Shackled, 2) execute said benchmarks and provide
results, 3) demonstrate a potential use case of Shackled in the domain of
tokenised generative art, 4) provide a no-code user interface to Shackled, 5)
enumerate the challenges associated with programming complex algorithms in
Solidity smart contracts, and 6) outline potential directions for improving the
Shackled platform. It is our hope that this work increases the Ethereum
blockchain's native graphics processing capabilities, and that it enables
increased use of smart contracts for more complex algorithms, thus increasing
the overall richness of the Ethereum ecosystem.

in giant molecular clouds where the magnetic turbulence is suppressed by
neutral-ion damping, as our results require a slow diffusion inside dense

Commonly, the input dataset for their computation consists of fine 3D grids of
scalar fields representing either the seismic-driven reflectivities (e.g.,
amplitudes of 3D seismic migrated volumes) or model-driven reflectivities,
computed, for example, from the derived elastic impedance parameters.
Conventionally, the computation of curvature parameters at each grid point is
based on analyzing the local change in the inline/crossline dips, considering
the potential existence of a local quadratic reflecting surface in the vicinity
of that point. This assumption breaks down for subsurface points in the
vicinity of either complex reflecting surfaces (e.g., brittle/rough/tilted
synclines/anticlines, ridges/troughs, and saddles) and/or sharp discontinuous
geological features (e.g., fault edges/tips, pinch-outs, fracture systems,
channels, small geobodies), where the values of the computed curvature become
extremely high. While these high values can indicate the existence of
non-reflecting objects, they do not deliver their specific geometric
characteristics. We present a novel method that better characterizes the shapes
of these complex geological features by extending the assumption of local
surfaces (2D surfaces in 3D space) into hypersurfaces (3D hypersurfaces in 4D
space), with their corresponding principal and effective curvature parameters.

constraints. This paper aims to serve as a baseline by designing detectors to
reach tradeoffs between energy and performance from two perspectives: 1) We
extensively analyze various CNNs to identify low-energy architectures,
including the selection of activation functions, convolutions operators, and
feature fusion structures on necks. These underappreciated details in past
works seriously affect the energy consumption of detectors; 2) To break through
the dilemmatic energy-performance problem, we propose a balanced detector
driven by energy using discovered low-energy components named
\textit{FemtoDet}. In addition to the novel construction, we further improve
FemtoDet by considering convolutions and training strategy optimizations.
Specifically, we develop a new instance boundary enhancement (IBE) module for
convolution optimization to overcome the contradiction between the limited
capacity of CNNs and detection tasks in diverse spatial representations, and
propose a recursive warm-restart (RecWR) for optimizing training strategy to
escape the sub-optimization of light-weight detectors, considering the data

important role in cosmological parameter estimation. In this work, we give for
the first time the joint constraints on cosmological parameters using the
future multi-band GW standard siren observations. We simulate the multi-band GW
standard sirens based on the SKA-era pulsar timing array (PTA), the Taiji
observatory, and the Cosmic Explorer (CE) to perform cosmological analysis. In
the $\Lambda$CDM model, we find that the joint PTA+Taiji+CE data could provide
a tight constraint on the Hubble constant with a $0.5\%$ precision. Moreover,
PTA+Taiji+CE could break the cosmological parameter degeneracies generated by
CMB, especially in the dynamical dark energy models. When combining the
PTA+Taiji+CE data with the CMB data, the constraint precisions of $\Omega_{\rm
m}$ and $H_0$ are $1.0\%$ and $0.3\%$, meeting the standard of precision
cosmology. The joint CMB+PTA+Taiji+CE data give $\sigma(w)=0.028$ in the $w$CDM

their level of engagement. In this paper, backed by educational psychology, we
question the necessity of modeling the order of behavioral and emotional states
of students in measuring their engagement. We develop bag-of-words-based models

computing linear estimators using flow statistics from an initial training
period and evaluating their performance during a subsequent testing period with
data obtained from direct numerical simulation (DNS). We address cases where
(i) no, (ii) limited, and (iii) full-field training data are available using
estimators based on (i) resolvent modes, (ii) resolvent-based estimation, and
(iii) spectral proper orthogonal decomposition modes. During training, we
introduce blockwise inversion to accurately and efficiently compute the
resolvent operator in an interpretable manner. During testing, we enable
efficient streaming reconstructions by using a temporal sliding discrete
Fourier transform to recursively update Fourier coefficients using incoming
measurements. We use this framework to reconstruct with minimal time delay the
turbulent velocity fluctuations in a minimal channel at $Re_\tau \approx 186$

context of the extent of data required and thereby identify potential use cases
for each estimator. The reconstructions capture large portions of the dynamics
from relatively few measurement planes when the linear estimators are computed

the average causal effect (ACE) depends on causal and missingness assumptions.
The latter can be depicted by adding variable-specific missingness indicators
to causal diagrams, creating ""missingness-directed acyclic graphs"" (m-DAGs).
Previous research described ten canonical m-DAGs, representing typical
multivariable missingness mechanisms in epidemiological studies, and determined
the recoverability of the ACE in the absence of effect modification. We extend
the research by determining the recoverability of the ACE in settings with
effect modification and conducting a simulation study evaluating the
performance of widely used missing data methods when estimating the ACE using
correctly specified g-computation, which has not been previously studied.
Methods assessed were complete case analysis (CCA) and various multiple
imputation (MI) implementations regarding the degree of compatibility with the
outcome model used in g-computation. Simulations were based on an example from
the Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study (VAHCS), where interest was in
estimating the ACE of adolescent cannabis use on mental health in young
adulthood. In the canonical m-DAGs that excluded unmeasured common causes of
missingness indicators, we derived the recoverable ACE if no incomplete
variable causes its missingness, and non-recoverable otherwise. Besides, the
simulation showed that compatible MI approaches may enable approximately
unbiased ACE estimation, unless the outcome causes its missingness or it causes
the missingness of a variable that causes its missingness. Researchers must
consider sensitivity analysis methods incorporating external information in the
latter setting. The VAHCS case study illustrates the practical implications of
these findings.

The asymptotic power-law index has typically values p~3 but with a large

overestimate the filament widths. The effect is potentially tens of per cent at
column densities above N(H$_2$) ~ $10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ but is reduced in more
intense radiation fields, such as the Orion region. Spatial variations in dust
properties could cause errors of similar magnitude. In the MIR analysis, dust
scattering should generally not be a significant factor, unless there are
high-mass stars nearby or the dust MIR scattering efficiency is higher than in
the tested dust models. Thermal MIR dust emission can be a more significant
source of error, especially close to embedded sources. The analysis of
interstellar filaments can be affected by several sources of systematic error,

the early 2000s and operated until 2016 when it was dismantled. A straight path
to evaluate the viability of the reassembly of the Schenberg antenna is to
verify the possibility of detecting gravitational wave (GW) signals within its
design sensitivity features. The eventual identification of significant signals
would operate as motivation for the Schenberg rebuild. As the antenna was
dismantled, we can get some indication from the third observing run (O3) data
of the LIGO detectors. It is based on the similarity between Schenberg
sensitivity and the sensitivity of the interferometers in the O3 [3150-3260] Hz
band. We search for signals with milliseconds to a few seconds without making
assumptions about their morphology, polarization, and arrival sky direction.
The data were analyzed with the coherent WaveBurst pipeline (cWB) with
frequencies from 512 Hz to 4096 Hz and the search targets only signals with
bandwidth overlapping the Schenberg frequency band. No statistically
significant evidence of GW bursts during O3 was found. The null result was used
to feature the search efficiency in identifying different simulated signal
morphologies and establish upper limits on the GW burst event rate as a
function of its strain amplitude. The present search, and consequently
Schenberg, is sensitive to sources emitting isotropically 5 x 10e(-6) M_sun c^2
in GWs from a distance of 10 kpc with 50% detection efficiency and with a false
alarm rate of 1/100 years. The feasibility of detecting f-modes of neutron

bands are expectedly similar to one another. Despite also being linearly
polarized, S-band receivers have an entirely different design and distinct
performance characteristics from the lower two bands. As introduced in previous
work for the L band, evidence of higher-order waveguide mode activation also
appears in S-band measurements but there are differences in its manifestation.

as a quantitative measure of class separability. Virtually no clustering is
found in the raw data, even after transforming the EEG signals of each
thirty-second epoch from the time domain into the more informative frequency

encodes the depth of sleep and therefore correlates strongly with the
'hypnogram', a common plot of the discrete sleep stages over time. Moreover,
$C_1(t)$ shows persistent trends during extended time periods where the sleep
stage is constant, suggesting that sleep may be better understood as a
continuum. These intriguing properties of $C_1(t)$ are not only relevant for
understanding brain dynamics during sleep, but might also be exploited in
low-cost single-channel sleep tracking devices for private and clinical use.

metallicity bulk solid helium becomes an excitonic insulator (EI), an exotic
state of matter typically observed in low-dimensional systems in which
electrostatically bound electron-hole pairs form spontaneously. Furthermore, it
is shown that electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is significantly enhanced across

gravitational potential of astrophysical objects with high contrasts in
density, for which nested or adaptive meshes are required. Methods. We present
an extension of the convolution method for computing the gravitational
potential to the nested Cartesian grids. The method makes use of the
convolution theorem to compute the gravitational potential using its integral
form. Results. A comparison of our method with the iterative outside-in
conjugate gradient and generalized minimal residual methods for solving the
Poisson equation using nonspherically symmetric density configurations has
shown a comparable performance in terms of the errors relative to the analytic
solutions. However, the convolution method is characterized by several
advantages and outperforms the considered iterative methods by factors 10--200
in terms of the runtime, especially when graphics processor units are utilized.
The convolution method also shows an overall second-order convergence, except
for the errors at the grid interfaces where the convergence is linear.
Conclusions. High computational speed and ease in implementation can make the
convolution method a preferred choice when using a large number of nested
grids. The convolution method, however, becomes more computationally costly if
the dipole moments of tightly spaced gravitating objects are to be considered
at coarser grids.

the other detector carried by $Bob$ is static. With this set-up, we investigate
the entanglement harvesting condition and the measure of the harvested
entanglement, concurrence, in the nonextremal and extremal scenarios.
Interestingly, our observations suggest a qualitative similarity in
characteristics of the harvested entanglement between these two scenarios.
Compared to the single detector transition probabilities, one can find a
specific and consistent quantitative feature in the nonextremal and extremal
concurrence for a broad range of black hole charges. With moderately large
detector transition energy, the extremal background always accounts for the
larger harvesting than the nonextremal one. In contrast, with low detector
transition energy, harvesting on the nonextremal background can be greater. We
also study the origin of the harvested entanglement, i.e., whether it is true
harvesting or communication based, and discuss our findings in the nonextremal

relevant for technical applications. In this context, lean H2-air flames show
promising features but, among other characteristics, they tend to exhibit
thermo-diffusive instabilities. The formation of cellular structures associated
with these instabilities leads to an increased flame surface area which further
promotes the flame propagation speed, an important reference quantity for
design, control, and safe operation of technical combustors. While many studies
have addressed the physical phenomena of intrinsic flame instabilities in the
past, there is also a demand to predict such flame characteristics with
reduced-order models to allow computationally efficient simulations. In this
work, a H2-air spherical expanding flame, which exhibits thermo-diffusive
instabilities, is studied with flamelet-based modeling approaches both in
a-priori and a-posteriori manner. A recently proposed Flamelet/Progress
Variable (FPV) model, with a manifold based on unstretched planar flames, and a
novel FPV approach, which takes into account a large curvature variation in the
tabulated manifold, are compared to detailed chemistry (DC) calculations.
First, both FPV approaches are assessed in terms of an a-priori test with the
DC reference dataset. Thereafter, the a-posteriori assessment contains two
parts: a linear stability analysis of perturbed planar flames and the
simulation of the spherical expanding flame. Both FPV models are systematically
analyzed considering global and local flame properties in comparison to the DC
reference data. It is shown that the new FPV model, incorporating large
curvature variations in the manifold, leads to improved predictions for the
microstructure of the corrugated flame front and the formation of cellular
structures, while global flame properties are reasonably well reproduced by
both models.

considering the discretization of Laplace type differential equations or, more
generally, multidimensional operators with separable coefficients. In this
work, we focus on the numerical solution of linear systems of the form $$
\left(I\otimes \dots\otimes I \otimes A_1+\dots + A_d\otimes I \otimes\dots

  We propose and analyze a nested divide-and-conquer scheme, based on the
technology of low-rank updates, that attains the quasi-optimal computational
cost $\mathcal O(n^d (\log(n) + \log(\kappa)^2 + \log(\kappa)
\log(\epsilon^{-1})))$ where $\kappa$ is the condition number of the linear
system, and $\epsilon$ the target accuracy. Our theoretical analysis highlights
the role of inexactness in the nested calls of our algorithm and provides worst
case estimates for the amplification of the residual norm. The performances are
validated on 2D and 3D case studies.

outdoor multi-modal dataset, OMMO dataset, containing complex land objects and
scenes with calibrated images, point clouds and prompt annotations. Meanwhile,
a new benchmark for several outdoor NeRF-based tasks is established, such as
novel view synthesis, surface reconstruction, and multi-modal NeRF. To create
the dataset, we capture and collect a large number of real fly-view videos and
select high-quality and high-resolution clips from them. Then we design a
quality review module to refine images, remove low-quality frames and
fail-to-calibrate scenes through a learning-based automatic evaluation plus
manual review. Finally, a number of volunteers are employed to add the text
descriptions for each scene and key-frame to meet the potential multi-modal
requirements in the future. Compared with existing NeRF datasets, our dataset
contains abundant real-world urban and natural scenes with various scales,
camera trajectories, and lighting conditions. Experiments show that our dataset
can benchmark most state-of-the-art NeRF methods on different tasks. We will
release the dataset and model weights very soon.

recently-introduced framework, named \emph{maximum submodular ranking} (MSR),
tackles a family of ranking problems that arise naturally when resources are
shared among multiple demands with different budgets. For example, the MSR
framework can be used to rank web pages for multiple user intents. In this
paper, we extend the MSR framework in the streaming setting. In particular, we
consider two different streaming models and we propose practical approximation
algorithms. In the first streaming model, called \emph{function arriving}, we
assume that submodular functions (demands) arrive continuously in a stream,
while in the second model, called \emph{item arriving}, we assume that items
(resources) arrive continuously. Furthermore, we study the MSR problem with
additional constraints on the output sequence, such as a matroid constraint
that can ensure fair exposure among items from different groups. These
extensions significantly broaden the range of problems that can be captured by
the MSR framework. On the practical side, we develop several novel applications

using a limited amount of additional training data. Performance was evaluated
using classical binary measures (accuracy, recall, precision) for both centers

cells have emerged showing a continuously reduced amount of energetic disorder.
While searching for future high efficiency material systems, it is therefore
important to correctly characterize this energetic disorder. While there are
several techniques in literature, the most common approaches to probe the
density of defect states are using optical excitation as in external quantum
efficiency measurements or sequential filling of the tail states by applying an

With drift-diffusion simulations, we demonstrate that the approaches probe

importance is shown in two ways. First, we present a simple yet effective new

GCAD over existing detectors including deep-learning detectors are: (i) better

addition, monitoring the firmware operations using existing side channels from

particles cannot pass each other. In such processes, the diffusion of a tagged
particle is typically normal at short times and becomes subdiffusive at long
times. For hard-sphere interparticle interaction, the time-dependent mean
squared displacement of a tracer is well understood. Here we develop a scaling
theory for adhesive particles. It provides a full description of the
time-dependent diffusive behavior with a scaling function that depends on an
effective strength of adhesive interaction. Particle clustering induced by the
adhesive interaction slows down the diffusion at short times, while it enhances
subdiffusion at long times. The enhancement effect can be quantified in
measurements irrespective of how tagged particles are injected into the system.
Combined effects of pore structure and particle adhesiveness should speed up
translocation of molecules through narrow pores.

model contains two modes, i.e., the LoW mode and the POD-based mode, and the
model matches with the LES at two, instead of one, off-wall locations. To show
that the proposed model captures non-equilibrium effects, we perform {\it
a-priori} and {\it a-posteriori} tests in the context of both equilibrium and
non-equilibrium flows. The {\it a-priori} tests show that the proposed wall
model captures extreme wall-shear stress events better than the equilibrium
wall model. The model also captures non-equilibrium effects due to adverse
pressure gradients. The {\it a-posteriori} tests show that the wall model
captures the rapid decrease and the initial decrease of the streamwise
wall-shear stress in channels subjected to suddenly imposed adverse and
transverse pressure gradients, respectively, both of which are missed by
currently available wall models. These results show promise in applying modal
analysis for turbulence wall modeling. In particular, the results show that
employing multiple modes helps in the modeling of non-equilibrium flows.

First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FO-MAML) to the vicinity of a

convexity of the reformulation based on Moreau envelopes. Furthermore, to fill
the gaps in the comparison of FO-MAML to the Implicit MAML (iMAML), we show
that the objective of iMAML is neither smooth nor convex, implying that it has

public electric vehicle charging infrastructures (EVCIs) must be equipped with
a good number of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) with fast charging
capability to accommodate the EV traffic demand, or else it would lead to

infrastructures significantly impacts the distribution system (DS). We propose
the optimal placement of fast-charging EVCIs at different locations in the
distribution system so that the power loss and voltage deviations are kept at a
minimum using multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). Time-series
analysis of the distribution and EV load variations are performed using MATLAB

the electron densities of singly-ionized oxygen nebulae with the standard

the $z=4-9$ galaxies are $n_{\rm e}\gtrsim 300$ cm$^{-3}$ significantly higher
than those of low-$z$ galaxies at a given stellar mass, star-formation rate
(SFR), and specific SFR. Interestingly, typical electron densities of singly
ionized nebulae increase from $z=0$ to $z=1-3$ and $z=4-9$, which is
approximated by the evolutionary relation of $n_{\rm e}\propto(1+z)^{p}$ with
$p\sim 1-2$. Although it is not obvious that the ISM property of $n_{\rm e}$ is
influenced by global galaxy properties, these results may suggest that nebula
densities of high-$z$ galaxies are generally high due to the compact
morphologies of high-$z$ galaxies evolving by $r_{\rm e}$ approximately
proportional to $(1+z)^{-1}$ ($r_{\rm vir} \propto (1+z)^{-1}$) for a given
stellar (halo) mass whose inverse square corresponds to the $p\sim 2$

by a combination of the compact morphology and the reduction of $n_{\rm e}$ due
to the high electron temperature of the high-$z$ metal poor nebulae.

focused on Deep Learning models to increase predictive performance, which are
difficult to interpret. As a result, end-users can only estimate engagement

previous methods where the whole simulation domain is discretized either using
the finite volume method or finite element method, our method spatially merges
them together using two types of discretization being tightly coupled on its
seams while enforcing second order accurate boundary conditions at free
surfaces. We achieve our formulation via a variational form using new shape
functions specifically designed for this purpose. By enabling a mixture of the
two methods, we can take advantage of the best of two worlds. For example,
finite volume method (FVM) result in sparse linear systems; however, complexity
is encountered when unstructured grids such as tetrahedral or Voronoi elements
are used. Finite element method (FEM), on the other hand, result in comparably
denser linear systems, but the complexity remains the same even if unstructured
elements are chosen; thereby facilitating spatial adaptivity. In this paper, we
propose to use FVM for the majority parts to retain the sparsity of linear
systems and FEM for parts where the grid elements are allowed to be freely
deformed. An example of this application is locally moving grids. We show that
by adapting the local grid movement to an underlying nearly rigid motion,
numerical diffusion is noticeably reduced; leading to better preservation of
structural details such as sharp edges, thin sheets and spindles of liquids.

inner disk from a colder dusty outer disk starting at up to 100 AU. In both
sources the inner disk extends to almost the stellar surface. Chemistry is
essential for the ionization of hydrogen in these disks. The lack of a gap
between the central objects and these disks suggests that they accrete through
boundary-layer accretion. This would exclude the stars having a strong magnetic
field. Their structures suggest that both disks are transitional in nature,
that is to say they are in the process of being cleared, either through
boundary-layer accretion, photo-evaporation, or through companion activity.

While classical algorithms can efficiently compute shortest paths, neural

and intractable tasks. As a step toward developing such networks, we hand-code
and learn models for Breadth-First Search (BFS), i.e. shortest path finding,
using the unified architectural framework of Neural Cellular Automata, which

present a neural implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS), and outline how it
can be combined with neural BFS to produce an NCA for computing diameter of a

hand-coded NCAs, training networks from scratch to solve the diameter problem
on grid mazes while exhibiting strong generalization ability. Finally, we
introduce a scheme in which data points are mutated adversarially during

generalization on out-of-distribution examples, while at the same time
generating data-sets with significantly more complex solutions for reasoning

Most previous haptic rendering methods strongly rely on data collected by

to their limited reachable space and the restrictions of tactile sensors. To
eliminate the need for tactile data, in this paper we propose a novel method
named as Vis2Hap to generate haptic rendering from visual inputs that can be
obtained from a distance without physical interaction. We take the surface
texture of objects as key cues to be conveyed to the human operator. To this
end, a generative model is designed to simulate the roughness and slipperiness
of the object's surface. To embed haptic cues in Vis2Hap, we use height maps
from tactile sensors and spectrograms from friction coefficients as the
intermediate outputs of the generative model. Once Vis2Hap is trained, it can
be used to generate height maps and spectrograms of new surface textures, from
which a friction image can be obtained and displayed on a haptic display. The
user study demonstrates that our proposed Vis2Hap method enables users to
access a realistic haptic feeling similar to that of physical objects. The
proposed vision-based haptic rendering has the potential to enhance human
operators' perception of the remote environment and facilitate robotic

triadic closure, but also the impact of {shared social context} and
{non-intentional (casual) interactions}, with several tunable parameters. We

used both broad-band ($K_{s}$, $K'$) and narrow-band (Br$\gamma$, H2)
observations from a number of NIR cameras
(UKIRT/UFTI,SUBARU/CIAO,TNG/NICS,LBT/PISCES,and LBT/LUCI1) to derive maps of
the continuum and the H$_2$ emission in the 2.12 $\mu$m line. Three sets of
images, obtained with AO systems (CIAO,2003; FLAO,2012; SOUL,2020), allowed us
to derive the proper motions of a large number of H$_2$ knots along the jet.
Photometry from all images was used to study the jet variability. We derived
knot proper motions in the range of 1.7-20.3 mas yr$^{-1}$ (i.e. 13-158 km
s$^{-1}$ at 1.64 kpc, avg. outflow tangential velocity $\sim$ 80 km s$^{-1}$).
The derived knot dynamical age spans a $\sim$ 200-4000 yr interval. A ring-like
H$_2$ feature near the protostar location exhibits peculiar kinematics and may
represent the outcome of a wide-angle wind impinging on the outflow cavity.
Both H$_2$ geometry and velocities agree with those inferred from proper
motions of the H$_2$O masers, located at a smaller distance from the protostar.
Although the total H$_2$ line emission from the knots does not exhibit time
variations at a $\widetilde{>}$ 0.3 mag level, we have found a clear continuum
flux variation (radiation scattered by the dust in the cavity opened by the
jet) which is anti-correlated between the blue-shifted and red-shifted lobes
and may be periodic (with a period of $\sim$ 12-18 yr). We suggest that the
continuum variability might be related to inner-disc oscillations which have
also caused the jet precession.

Zurek proposed that this cost was given by $K(x\vert y)$, the conditional
Kolmogorov complexity of $x$ given $y$ (up to an additive constant which does
not depend on $x$ or $y$). However, this result was derived from an informal
argument, applied only to deterministic computations, and had an arbitrary
dependence on the choice of protocol (via the additive constant). Here we use
stochastic thermodynamics to derive a generalized version of Zurek's bound from
a rigorous Hamiltonian formulation. Our bound applies to all quantum and
classical processes, whether noisy or deterministic, and it explicitly captures
the dependence on the protocol. We show that $K(x\vert y)$ is a minimal cost of
mapping $x$ to $y$ that must be paid using some combination of heat, noise, and
protocol complexity, implying a tradeoff between these three resources. Our

been profusely used in the literature to analyze the possible phases of neural

Moreover, its stochastic counterpart allows one to study fluctuation-induced
phenomena, such as avalanches. Here, we revisit the stochastic Wilson-Cowan
model paying special attention to the possible phase transitions between
quiescent and active phases. We unveil eight possible types of phase
transitions, including continuous ones with scaling behavior belonging to known
universality classes -- such as directed percolation and tricritical directed
percolation -- as well as novel ones. In particular, we show that under some
special circumstances, at a so-called Hopf tricritical directed percolation
transition, rather unconventional behavior including an anomalous breakdown of
scaling emerges. These results broaden our knowledge of the possible types of
critical behavior in networks of excitatory and inhibitory units and are of
relevance to understanding avalanche dynamics in actual neuronal recordings.
From a more general perspective, these results help extend the theory of
non-equilibrium phase transitions into quiescent or absorbing states.

are all topics of great interest in gravitational wave astronomy at present.
The superradiant instability allows an exotic compact object (ECO) to be
surrounded by an ultralight boson cloud, which leads to the emission of
gravitational waves and further triggers rich dynamical effects. In this paper,
we study the gravitational effects of superradiant instabilities by calculating
the energy fluxes of gravitational waves emitted from ultralight scalar dark
matter fields by solving the Teukolsky equation in the background of a massive
ECO phenomenologically described by a Kerr geometry with a reflective boundary
condition at its physical boundary. We find that both the amplitude and phase
of the reflectivity will either suppress or enhance the energy flux of GWs by
several orders of magnitude if $M\mu \gtrsim 0.5$ where $M$ and $\mu$ are the
mass of ECO and boson, respectively. However, the modifications to energy flux
are negligible if $M \mu \lesssim 0.5$. Our results suggest that reflectivity
will play a significant role in the near-horizon physics of ECO.

sufficient supervision. However, these models face a fundamental challenge that
the syntactic distribution of training data is partially observable in
comparison to the real world. In this paper, we propose a syntactically robust
training framework that enables models to be trained on a syntactic-abundant
distribution based on diverse paraphrase generation. To tackle the intrinsic
problem of knowledge deformation of paraphrasing, two algorithms based on
semantic similarity matching and syntactic tree walking are used to restore the
expressionally transformed knowledge. The training framework can be generally
applied to other syntactic partial observable domains. Based on the proposed
framework, we build a new evaluation set called CaRB-AutoPara, a syntactically
diverse dataset consistent with the real-world setting for validating the
robustness of the models. Experiments including a thorough analysis show that
the performance of the model degrades with the increase of the difference in
syntactic distribution, while our framework gives a robust boundary. The source

domains, Image-Text Retrieval (ITR) aims at searching for the target instances
that are semantically relevant to the given query from the other modality, and
its key challenge is to measure the semantic similarity across different
modalities. Although significant progress has been achieved, existing
approaches typically suffer from two major limitations: (1) It hurts the
accuracy of the representation by directly exploiting the bottom-up attention
based region-level features where each region is equally treated. (2) It limits
the scale of negative sample pairs by employing the mini-batch based end-to-end
training mechanism. To address these limitations, we propose a Unified Semantic
Enhancement Momentum Contrastive Learning (USER) method for ITR. Specifically,
we delicately design two simple but effective Global representation based
Semantic Enhancement (GSE) modules. One learns the global representation via
the self-attention algorithm, noted as Self-Guided Enhancement (SGE) module.
The other module benefits from the pre-trained CLIP module, which provides a
novel scheme to exploit and transfer the knowledge from an off-the-shelf model,
noted as CLIP-Guided Enhancement (CGE) module. Moreover, we incorporate the
training mechanism of MoCo into ITR, in which two dynamic queues are employed
to enrich and enlarge the scale of negative sample pairs. Meanwhile, a Unified
Training Objective (UTO) is developed to learn from mini-batch based and
dynamic queue based samples. Extensive experiments on the benchmark MSCOCO and
Flickr30K datasets demonstrate the superiority of both retrieval accuracy and
inference efficiency. Our source code will be released at

of causal relationships between a set of variables. Yet in many situations,
there are non-causal relationships among variables. For example, we may want

cannot be done in standard causal models, because we can intervene
simultaneously on all three variables. The goal of this paper is to extend
standard causal models to allow for constraints on settings of variables.
Although the extension is relatively straightforward, to make it useful we have
to define a new intervention operation that $disconnects$ a variable from a

the Delaunay triangulation of the Fibonacci covering. The Fibonacci approach
generates a uniform isotropic covering of the sphere with approximately
equal-area triangles, thus potentially supporting a smooth thermodynamic limit.
In the absence of a magnetic field, the model exhibits a spontaneous
magnetization phase transition at a critical temperature that depends on the
connectivity properties of the underlying lattice. While in the standard
triangular lattice, every site is connected to 6 neighboring sites, the
triangulated Fibonacci lattice of the curved surface contains a substantial
density of the 5- and 7-vertices. As the number of sites in the Fibonacci
sphere increases, the triangular cover of the sphere experiences a series of
singular transitions that reflect a sudden change in its connectivity
properties. These changes substantially influence the statistical features of
the system leading to a series of first-order-like discontinuities as the
radius of the sphere increases. We found that the Ising model on a uniform,
Fibonacci-triangulated sphere in a large-radius limit possesses the phase
transition at the critical temperature $T_c \simeq 3.33(3) J$, which is
slightly lower than the thermodynamic result for an equilaterally triangulated
planar lattice. This mismatch is a memory effect: the planar Fibonacci lattice
remembers its origin from the curved space.

invariant model of an interacting scalar relativistic particle with the
electromagnetic field. The latter is treated as a constant background variable
and is, therefore, independent of the evolution parameter of the trajectory of
the above interacting scalar relativistic particle. We show that the universal

further demonstrate that the 1D diffeomorphism invariant models of all kinds of

speculation and so far only seven events have been reported, among which two
involve less than five meteors, and three were seen during the Leonid storms.
Aims. The 1995 outburst of Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann was predicted to
result in a meteor shower in May 2022. We detected the shower, proved this to
be the result of this outburst, and detected another meteor cluster during the
same observation mission. Methods. The {\tau}-Herculids meteor shower outburst
on 31 May 2022 was continuously monitored for 4 hours during an airborne
campaign. The video data were analyzed using a recently developed
computer-vision processing chain for meteor real-time detection. Results. We
report and characterize the detection of a meteor cluster involving 38
fragments, detected at 06:48 UT for a total duration of 11.3 s. The derived
cumulative size frequency distribution index is relatively shallow: s = 3.1.
Our open-source computer-vision processing chain (named FMDT) detects 100% of
the meteors that a human eye is able to detect in the video. Classical
automated motion detection assuming a static camera was not suitable for the
stabilized camera setup because of residual motion. Conclusions. From all
reported meteor clusters, we crudely estimate their occurrence to be less than
one per million observed meteors. Low heliocentric distance enhances the
probability of such meteoroid self-disruption in the interplanetary space.

tradeoff using event cameras. Event cameras operate at microseconds resolution
with negligible motion blur, and output a continuous stream of events that
precisely measures how light changes over time asynchronously. We propose a
setup that consists of a linear polarizer rotating at high-speeds in front of
an event camera. Our method uses the continuous event stream caused by the
rotation to reconstruct relative intensities at multiple polarizer angles.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms physics-based baselines
using frames, reducing the MAE by 25% in synthetic and real-world dataset. In
the real world, we observe, however, that the challenging conditions (i.e.,
when few events are generated) harm the performance of physics-based solutions.
To overcome this, we propose a learning-based approach that learns to estimate
surface normals even at low event-rates, improving the physics-based approach

does not allow failure transitions, and preprocessing the WFSA to eliminate
failure transitions could greatly increase $|E|$. We extend the backward
algorithm to handle failure transitions directly. Our approach is efficient
when the average state has outgoing arcs for only a small fraction $s \ll 1$ of
the alphabet $\Sigma$. We propose an algorithm for general acyclic WFSAs which
runs in $O{\left(|E| + s |\Sigma| |Q| T_\text{max} \log{|\Sigma|}\right)}$,
where $Q$ is the set of states and $T_\text{max}$ is the size of the largest
connected component of failure transitions. When the failure transition
topology satisfies a condition exemplified by CRFs, the $T_\text{max}$ factor
can be dropped, and when the weight semiring is a ring, the $\log{|\Sigma|}$
factor can be dropped. In the latter case (ring-weighted acyclic WFSAs), we
also give an alternative algorithm with complexity $\displaystyle O{\left(|E| +
|\Sigma| |Q| \min(1,s\pi_\text{max}) \right)}$, where $\pi_\text{max}$ is the
size of the longest failure path.

techniques with autonomous vehicles has been used recently to improve the
limitations of more complex methods, such as long baseline and ultra-short
baseline systems. Nonetheless, in ROSB target localization methods, the
trajectory of the tracking vehicle near the localized target plays an important
role in obtaining the best accuracy of the predicted target position. Here, we
investigate a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to find the optimal path
that an autonomous vehicle should follow in order to increase and optimize the
overall accuracy of the predicted target localization, while reducing time and
power consumption. To accomplish this objective, different experimental tests
have been designed using state-of-the-art deep RL algorithms. Our study also
compares the results obtained with the analytical Fisher information matrix
approach used in previous studies. The results revealed that the policy learned
by the RL agent outperforms trajectories based on these analytical solutions,
e.g. the median predicted error at the beginning of the target's localisation
is 17% less. These findings suggest that using deep RL for localizing acoustic
targets could be successfully applied to in-water applications that include
tracking of acoustically tagged marine animals by autonomous underwater
vehicles. This is envisioned as a first necessary step to validate the use of
RL to tackle such problems, which could be used later on in a more complex
scenarios

strategy based on the standard multi-head self attention is applied to solve
the second. The Re-Attention module dynamically adjusts the attention scores to
the fine- and coarse-grained features output by MGA for each point. Extensive

with system size. The time crystal phase transition has attracted much
attention in recent years for it provides a scenario of phase transition of
quantum dynamics, unlike conventional equilibrium phase transitions. Here, we
study critical dynamics near the Floquet time crystal phase transition. Its
critical behavior is described by introducing a space-time coarse grained

revealing the CSD. This is demonstrated by investigating the Floquet dynamics
of one-dimensional disordered spin chain. Through finite-size scaling analysis,
we show the relaxation time has a universal sub-exponential scaling near the
critical point, in sharp contrast to the standard power-law behavior for CSD in
equilibrium phase transitions. This prediction can be readily tested in present

around the M1.5 V star GJ 806 (TOI-4481). GJ 806 is a bright (V=10.8 mag, J=7.3
mag) and nearby (d=12 pc) M dwarf that hosts at least two planets. The
innermost planet, GJ 806 b, is transiting and has an ultra-short orbital period
of 0.93 d, a radius of 1.331+-0.023 Re, a mass of 1.90+-0.17 Me, a mean density
of 4.40+-0.45 g/cm3, and an equilibrium temperature of 940+-10 K. We detect a
second, non-transiting, super-Earth planet in the system, GJ 806c, with an
orbital period of 6.6 d, a minimum mass of 5.80+-0.30 Me, and an equilibrium
temperature of 490+-5 K. The radial velocity data also shows evidence for a
third periodicity at 13.6 d, although the current dataset does not provide
sufficient evidence to unambiguously distinguish between a third super-Earth
mass (Msin(i)=8.50+-0.45 Me) planet or stellar activity. Additionally, we
report one transit observation of GJ 806 b taken with CARMENES in search for a
possible extended atmosphere of H or He, but we can only place upper limits to
its existence. This is not surprising as our evolutionary models support the
idea that any possible primordial H/He atmosphere that GJ 806 b might have had,
would long have been lost. However, GJ 806b's bulk density makes it likely that
the planet hosts some type of volatile atmosphere. In fact, with a transmission
spectroscopy metrics (TSM) of 44 and an emission spectroscopy metrics (ESM) of
24, GJ 806 b the third-ranked terrestrial planet around an M dwarf suitable for
transmission spectroscopy studies, and the most promising terrestrial planet
for emission spectroscopy studies.

Iterative, Joint, and Cascade. Experiments suggest that the Joint scheme is the
best-performing scheme; however, its application requires an expensive search
for the best weight combination of the loss constituents. The Iterative scheme
enables the sharing of features between the two parts of the network at the
early stages of training. It performs better on complex data with multi-labels.
Further experiments showed that methods designed with different architectures

developed for quantifying the individual electrophysiological properties of
large numbers of uncoupled cardiomyocytes under ion channel block in terms of
the parameters values of a conceptual fast-slow model of electrical
excitability. The approach is applied to a population of nearly 500 rabbit
ventricular myocytes for which action potential duration (APD) before and after

functions of APD and dAPD (drug-induced change in APD) for each myocyte. Two
free protocol-related quantities are calibrated to experiment using an
adaptive-domain procedure based on an original assumption of optimal

Newtonian gravity provides an excellent pedagogical tool to understand the

the General Relativistic formula for the power carried by gravitational waves
is required in this scheme. It turns out there is a subtle point: for the
consistency of the this simple, yet pedagogical computation, taking the lowest

devices, several studies are being conducted with the aim of bringing machine
learning to the quantum domain. Currently, quantum variational circuits are one
of the main strategies used to build such models. However, despite its
widespread use, we still do not know what are the minimum resources needed to
create a quantum machine learning model. In this article, we analyze how the
expressiveness of the parametrization affects the cost function. We
analytically show that the more expressive the parametrization is, the more the
cost function will tend to concentrate around a value that depends both on the
chosen observable and on the number of qubits used. For this, we initially
obtain a relationship between the expressiveness of the parametrization and the
mean value of the cost function. Afterwards, we relate the expressivity of the
parametrization with the variance of the cost function. Finally, we show some
numerical simulation results that confirm our theoretical-analytical
predictions.

uncertain. Here we present new mid-IR observations of Beta Pic to track any
motion of the dust clump. Together with previous observations, the data span a
period of 12 years. We measured any projected displacement of the dust clump
over the 12-yr period to be $0.2^{+1.3}_{-1.4}$ au away from the star based on
the median and 1$\sigma$ uncertainty, and constrain this displacement to be <11
au at the 3$\sigma$ level. This implies that the observed motion is
incompatible with Keplerian motion at the 2.8$\sigma$ level. It has been
posited that a planet migrating outwards may trap planetesimals into a 2:1
resonance, resulting in the observed clump at pericentre of their orbits that
trails the planet. The observed motion is also incompatible with such resonant
motion at the 2.6$\sigma$ level. While Keplerian motion and resonant motion is
still possible, the data suggest that the dust clump is more likely stationary.
Such a stationary dust clump could originate from the collision or tidal
disruption of a planet-sized body, or from secular perturbations due to a
planet that create regions with enhanced densities in the disk.

different mechanisms to fuse each other and is enhanced with multi-view
collaborative learning techniques. Firstly, the Fu-TransHNet utilizes the
Transformer branch and the CNN branch to realize the global feature learning
and local feature learning, respectively. Secondly, a fusion module is designed
to integrate the features from two branches. The fusion module consists of two
parts: 1) the Global-Local Feature Fusion (GLFF) part and 2) the Dense Fusion
of Multi-scale features (DFM) part. The former is built to compensate the
feature information mission from two branches at the same scale; the latter is
constructed to enhance the feature representation. Thirdly, the above two
branches and fusion modules utilize multi-view cooperative learning techniques
to obtain their respective weights that denote their importance and then make a
final decision comprehensively. Experimental results showed that the
Fu-TransHNet network was superior to the existing methods on five widely used
benchmark datasets. In particular, on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB dataset containing

results, it is revealed that there is a strong linear relationship between the
applied force or torque and the estimated disturbances. The proposed prediction
algorithm has two phases: the identification & the prediction. During the
identification phase, the linear relationship is identified from the observer
output using a recursive least-square algorithm. In the prediction phase, the
identified linear relationship is used with a force plan, which would be

con\-se\-quen\-tly, the realization of a pure hadronic phase transition in the
hot and finite baryon density nuclear matter. The analysis is performed by
means of an effective relativistic mean-field model with the inclusion of
hyperons, $\Delta$-isobars, and the lightest pseudoscalar and vector meson
degrees of freedom. The Gibbs conditions on the global conservation of baryon
number and zero net strangeness in symmetric nuclear matter are required.
Similarly to the liquid-gas phase transition, we show that a phase transition,
characterized by mechanical instabilities (due to fluctuations on the baryon
number) and chemical-diffusive instabilities (due to fluctuations on the
strangeness number), can take place for a finite range of $\Delta$-meson
coupling constants, compatible with different experimental constraints. The
hadronic phase transition, which presents similar features to the quark-hadron
phase transition, is characterized by different strangeness content during the
mixed phase and, consequently, by a sensible variation of the strange
anti-particle to particle ratios.

the holistic representation of lane lines, which is intuitive and concise.
However, their performance lags behind the recent state-of-the-art methods due
to the limitation of their lane representation and optimization. In this paper,
we revisit the curve-based lane detection methods from the perspectives of the
lane representations' globality and locality. The globality of lane
representation is the ability to complete invisible parts of lanes with visible
parts. The locality of lane representation is the ability to modify lanes
locally which can simplify parameter optimization. Specifically, we first
propose to exploit the b-spline curve to fit lane lines since it meets the
locality and globality. Second, we design a simple yet efficient network BSNet
to ensure the acquisition of global and local features. Third, we propose a new
curve distance to make the lane detection optimization objective more
reasonable and alleviate ill-conditioned problems. The proposed methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS datasets,
which dramatically improved the accuracy of curve-based methods in the lane
detection task while running far beyond real-time (197FPS).

versatility benefits large-scale space-frame structures, as the individual

other functional requirements. To this end, however, the design and analysis of
such space-frames with distinct structural nodes needs to be highly automated.
A critical aspect in this context is automated integration of the local 3D
features into the 1D large-scale models. In the present work, a two-scale
modeling approach is developed to improve the design and linear-elastic
analysis of space frames with complex additively manufactured nodes. The
mechanical characteristics of the 3D nodes are numerically reduced through an
automated dimensional reduction process based on the Finite Cell Method (FCM)
and substructuring. The reduced stiffness quantities are assembled in the
large-scale 1D model which, in turn, enables efficient structural analysis. The
response of the 1D model is passed on to the local model, enabling fully
resolved 3D linear-elastic analysis. The proposed approach is numerically
verified on a simplified beam example. Furthermore, the workflow is
demonstrated on a tree canopy structure with additively manufactured nodes with
bolted connections. The form of the large-scale structure is found based on the
Combinatorial Equilibrium Modeling framework, and the different designs of the
local structural nodes are based on generative exploration of the design space.
It is demonstrated that the proposed methodology effectively automates the

ability to contextualise and attribute mental states to others without having

approaches to ToM have demonstrated that we can train the observer to read the
past and present behaviours of other agents and infer their beliefs (including
false beliefs about things that no longer exist), goals, intentions and future
actions. The challenges arise when the behavioural space is complex, demanding
skilful space navigation for rapidly changing contexts for an extended period.
We tackle the challenges by equipping the observer with novel neural memory
mechanisms to encode, and hierarchical attention to selectively retrieve
information about others. The memories allow rapid, selective querying of
distal related past behaviours of others to deliberatively reason about their
current mental state, beliefs and future behaviours. This results in ToMMY, a
theory of mind model that learns to reason while making little assumptions
about the underlying mental processes. We also construct a new suite of
experiments to demonstrate that memories facilitate the learning process and
achieve better theory of mind performance, especially for high-demand

exclusively provided by large centralized institutions. Specifically in the

control who can interact and conduct transactions through their monopoly of
online trust. However, as recent events have shown, allowing for-profit

Bayesian learning. In this article, we explore the implications of this
hypothesis for internal state temporal evolution. By using a timescale
separation between internal and external variables on the mesoscopic scale, we
derive a hierarchical Fokker-Planck equation for cell-microenvironment

changes in microenvironmental entropy dominate cell state probability

impacts cell decision-making. Notably, our formalism allows us to understand
cell state dynamics even without exact biochemical information about cell

  Fundus Image Quality Enhancement",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Retinal fundus images have been applied for the diagnosis and screening of
eye diseases, such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) or Diabetic Macular Edema
(DME). However, both low-quality fundus images and style inconsistency
potentially increase uncertainty in the diagnosis of fundus disease and even
lead to misdiagnosis by ophthalmologists. Most of the existing image
enhancement methods mainly focus on improving the image quality by leveraging
the guidance of high-quality images, which is difficult to be collected in
medical applications. In this paper, we tackle image quality enhancement in a
fully unsupervised setting, i.e., neither paired images nor high-quality
images. To this end, we explore the potential of the self-supervised task for
improving the quality of fundus images without the requirement of high-quality
reference images. Specifically, we construct multiple patch-wise domains via an
auxiliary pre-trained quality assessment network and a style clustering. To
achieve robust low-quality image enhancement and address style inconsistency,
we formulate two self-supervised domain adaptation tasks to disentangle the
features of image content, low-quality factor and style information by
exploring intrinsic supervision signals within the low-quality images.
Extensive experiments are conducted on EyeQ and Messidor datasets, and results
show that our DASQE method achieves new state-of-the-art performance when only
low-quality images are available.

main experimental challenges of modern physics. One experimental technique is
given by cryogenic detectors named bolometers that are really promising for
this purpose. The current generation tonne-scale experiment CUORE using this
technology is putting the best limit on $^{130}$Te 0$\nu$2$\beta$ half-life
with TeO$_2$ crystals but its sensitivity is limited by its background.
Therefore, it will be followed by the next generation experiment CUPID (CUORE
Upgrade with Particle IDentification) that will study $^{100}$Mo embedded
inside Li$_2$MoO$_4$ crystals in order to reduce the $\gamma$ background. It
will also read the scintillation light produced by Li$_2$MoO$_4$ by adding
another Ge bolometer acting as a light detector next to the main absorber to
reject the $\alpha$ background. Thanks to that, CUPID will reach a sensitivity
2 orders of magnitude higher than CUORE. However, in the case where this is not
enough to detect 0$\nu$2$\beta$, BINGO (Bi-Isotope Next Generation
0$\nu$2$\beta$ Observatory) is preparing the next-next generation of bolometric
experiments. To improve the 0$\nu$2$\beta$ discovery sensitivity, the goal is
to reduce drastically the number of background events in the region of interest
and to combine the use of the two previously cited isotopes: $^{130}$Te and
$^{100}$Mo. To achieve this goal, BINGO is proposing to implement an active
cryogenic veto to suppress the external $\gamma$ background, to use
Neganov-Trofimov-Luke effect to increase light detector sensitivity and to use
a revolutionary detector assembly to reduce the total surface radioactivity
contribution. In this article, we will focus on the latter and present the

are supported by the fact that the radii of BLRs measured by RM observations
are generally consistent with the self-gravitating regions of accretion disks.
We have shown in Paper I that the spiral arms excited by the gravitational
instabilities in these regions may exist in some disk-like BLRs. As the second
paper of the series, we investigate the loosely wound spiral arms excited by
gravitational instabilities in disk-like BLRs and present their observational
characteristics. Following the treatments of Adams et al. (1989), we solve the
governing integro-differential equation by a matrix scheme. The emission-line
profiles, velocity-delay maps, and velocity-resolved lags of the BLR spiral
arms are calculated. We find that the spiral arms can explain some phenomena in
observations: (1) the emission-line profiles in the mean and rms spectra have
different asymmetries, (2) some velocity-delay maps, e.g., NGC 5548, have
complex sub-features (incomplete ellipse), (3) the timescales of the asymmetry
changes in emission-line profiles (rms spectra) are short. These features are
attractive for modeling the observed line profiles and the properties of
reverberation, and for revealing the details of the BLR geometry and
kinematics.

of equations valid for investigating the evolution of early-type galaxies
(ETGs) (Donofrio & Chiosi, 2022). These equations are able to account for the
tilt of the Fundamental Plane (FP) and to explain the observed distributions of
ETGs in all its projections. In this paper we analyze the advantages offered by
those equations, derive the $\beta$ and $L'_0$ parameters for real and
simulated galaxies, and demonstrate that, according to the value of $\beta$,
galaxies can move only along some permitted directions in the FP projections.
Then, we show that simple galaxy models that grow in mass by infall of gas and
form stars with a star formation rate depending on the stellar velocity
dispersion nicely reproduce the observed distributions of ETGs in the FP
projections and yield $\beta$s that agree with the measured ones. We derive the
mutual relationships among the stellar mass, effective radius, velocity
dispersion, and luminosity of ETGs as a function of $\beta$ and calculate the
coefficients of the FP. Then, using the simple infall models, we show that the
star formation history of ETGs is compatible with the $\sigma$-dependent star
formation rate, and that both positive and negative values of $\beta$ are
possible in a standard theory of galaxy evolution. The parameter $\beta(t)$
offers a new view of the evolution of ETGs. In brief, i) it gives a coherent
interpretation of the FP and of the motions of galaxies in its projections; ii)
it is the fingerprint of their evolution; iii) it measures the degree of
virialization of ETGs; iv) and finally it allows us to infer their evolution in

second order in the angular velocity. The structure of this configuration is
obtained by integrating the Hartle-Thorne equations for slowly rotating
relativistic masses. We model a sequence in adiabatic and quasi-stationary
contraction, by varying the tenuity parameter $R/R_{\mathrm{S}}$, where $R$ is
the radius of the configuration and $R_{\mathrm{S}}$ is its Schwarzschild
radius. We determined the moment of inertia $I$, mass quadrupole moment $Q$,
and the ellipticity $\varepsilon$, for various configurations. Similar to
previous results for Maclaurin and polytropic spheroids, in slow rotation, we
found a change in the behaviour of the ellipticity when the tenuity reaches a
certain critical value. We compared our results of $I$ and $Q$ for the T-VII
model with those predicted by the universal fittings proposed for realistic
neutron stars. For the relevant range of compactness, we found that relative
errors are within $10\%$, thus suggesting the T-VII solution as a very good
approximation for the description of the interior of neutron stars.

towards optimizing the limited available resources of the medical facilities.
An automated segmentation of the infected volumes in lung CT is expected to
significantly aid in the diagnosis and care of patients. However, an accurate
demarcation of lesions remains problematic due to their irregular structure and
location(s) within the lung. A novel deep learning architecture, Composite Deep
network with Feature Weighting (CDNetFW), is proposed for efficient delineation
of infected regions from lung CT images. Initially a coarser-segmentation is
performed directly at shallower levels, thereby facilitating discovery of
robust and discriminatory characteristics in the hidden layers. The novel
feature weighting module helps prioritise relevant feature maps to be probed,
along with those regions containing crucial information within these maps. This
is followed by estimating the severity of the disease.The deep network CDNetFW
has been shown to outperform several state-of-the-art architectures in the
COVID-19 lesion segmentation task, as measured by experimental results on CT
slices from publicly available datasets, especially when it comes to defining
structures involving complex geometries.

in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in this paper, we analyze and explore
essential reasons for their success. We claim two factors that are critical for
3D large-scale scene understanding: a larger receptive field and operations
with greater non-linearity. The former is responsible for providing long range
contexts and the latter can enhance the capacity of the network. To achieve the
above properties, we propose a simple yet effective long range pooling (LRP)
module using dilation max pooling, which provides a network with a large
adaptive receptive field. LRP has few parameters, and can be readily added to
current CNNs. Also, based on LRP, we present an entire network architecture,
LRPNet, for 3D understanding. Ablation studies are presented to support our
claims, and show that the LRP module achieves better results than large kernel
convolution yet with reduced computation, due to its nonlinearity. We also
demonstrate the superiority of LRPNet on various benchmarks: LRPNet performs
the best on ScanNet and surpasses other CNN-based methods on S3DIS and
Matterport3D. Code will be made publicly available.

framework of turbulent thermals described by Morton \textit{et al.}, [Proc. R.
Soc. A: Math. Phys. Sci. \textbf{234}, 1 (1956)], we compare particle clouds
with salt-water thermals to highlight specificities due to the particulate
nature of the turbulence forcing. In the absence of rotation, particle clouds
initially behave as salty thermals with a modulation of their entrainment
capacity, which is optimally enhanced for a finite inertia $\mathcal{R}\simeq
0.3$ due to particulate effects. However this regime of turbulence is limited
in time due to the inertial decoupling between turbulent eddies and particles.
For the three values of $\Omega$ explored here, the particulate enhancement of
entrainment is inhibited. Moreover the cloud's expansion is interrupted when
the Coriolis force overcomes its inertia, forcing the cloud to transform into
vortical columnar flows which considerably increase the residence time of
particles.

we show that for configurations that have localized states at the
surfaces/edges, which translate into sharp resonances in the transmission, it
is possible to achieve large Seebeck coefficients and figures of merit by
carefully tuning their energy and their coupling to other states. We calculate
the thermoelectric coefficients as a function of different parameters and find
non-obvious behaviours, like the existence of a certain coupling between the
localized and bulk states for which these quantities have a maximum. The
highest Seebeck coefficients and figures of merit are achieved for symmetric
junctions, which have the same coupling between the localized state and the
bulk states on both sides of the gap. The features and trends of the
thermoelectric properties and their change with various parameters that we find
here cannot only be applied to systems with nanogaps, but also to many other
nanoscale junctions, such as e.g. those that have surface states or states
localized near the contacts between the nanoscale object and the electrodes.
The model presented here can therefore be used to characterize and predict the
thermoelectric properties of many different nanoscale junctions and can also
serve as a guide for studying other systems. These results pave then the way
for the design and fabrication of stable next-generation thermoelectric devices

insertions, edge deletions, and answers certain queries that are specific to
the problem under consideration. There has been a lot of research on dynamic
algorithms for graph problems that are solvable in polynomial time by a static
algorithm. However, while there is a large body of theoretical work on
efficient dynamic graph algorithms, a lot of these algorithms were never
implemented and empirically evaluated. In this work, we consider the fully
dynamic edge orientation problem, also called fully dynamic
$\Delta$-orientation problem, which is to maintain an orientation of the edges
of an undirected graph such that the out-degree is low. If edges are inserted
or deleted, one may have to flip the orientation of some edges in order to
avoid vertices having a large out-degree. While there has been theoretical work
on dynamic versions of this problem, currently there is no experimental
evaluation available. In this work, we close this gap and engineer a range of
new dynamic edge orientation algorithms as well as algorithms from the current
literature. Moreover, we evaluate these algorithms on real-world dynamic

APEX telescopes in the C$^{18}$O $J=2$-1 emission. Overall, the C$^{18}$O
emission shows clear velocity gradients at radii of $\sim$100-1000 au, which
likely originate from rotation of envelopes, while velocity gradients are less
clear and velocity structures are more perturbed on scales of $\sim$1000-10,000
au. IRAS 15398$-$3359 and L1527 IRS show a break at radii of $\sim$1200 and
$\sim$1700 au in the radial profile of the peak velocity, respectively. The
peak velocity is proportional to $r^{-1.38}$ or $r^{-1.7}$ within the break
radius, which can be interpreted as indicating a rotational motion of the
envelope with a degree of contamination of gas motions on larger spatial
scales. The peak velocity follows $v_\mathrm{peak} \propto r^{0.68}$ or
$v_\mathrm{peak} \propto r^{0.46}$ outside the break radius, which is similar
to the $J/M$-$R$ relation of dense cores. TMC-1A exhibits the radial profile of
the peak velocity not consistent with the rotational motion of the envelope nor
the $J/M$-$R$ relation. The origin of the relation of $v_\mathrm{peak} \propto
r^{0.46\operatorname{-}0.68}$ is investigated by examining correlations of the
velocity deviation ($\delta v$) and the spatial scale ($\tau$) in the two
sources. Obtained spatial correlations, $\delta v \propto \tau^{\sim0.6}$, are
consistent with the scaling law predicted by turbulence models, which may
suggest the large-scale velocity structures originate from turbulence.

Our proposed model consists of a multi-channel feature extraction module and an
adaptive feature importance recalibration module. AICare explicitly identifies
the key features that strongly indicate the outcome prediction for each patient
to build the health status embedding individually. This study has collected
13,091 clinical follow-up visits and demographic data of 656 PD patients. To
verify the application universality, this study has also collected 4,789 visits
of 1,363 hemodialysis dialysis (HD) as an additional experiment dataset to test
the prediction performance, which will be discussed in the Appendix. Results:
1) Experiment results show that AICare achieves 81.6%/74.3% AUROC and
47.2%/32.5% AUPRC for the 1-year mortality prediction task on PD/HD dataset
respectively, which outperforms the state-of-the-art comparative deep learning

relationship between the causes of mortality in patients with PD and clinical
features based on an end-to-end deep learning model. 3) This study first
reveals the pattern of variation in the importance of each feature in the
mortality prediction based on built-in interpretability. 4) We develop a

  comprehensive review and future research directions",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a brain disorder where different people experience
different symptoms, such as hallucination, delusion, flat-talk, disorganized
thinking, etc. In the long term, this can cause severe effects and diminish
life expectancy by more than ten years. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis
of SCZ is prevalent, and modalities like structural magnetic resonance imaging
(sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and
electroencephalogram (EEG) assist in witnessing the brain abnormalities of the
patients. Moreover, for accurate diagnosis of SCZ, researchers have used
machine learning (ML) algorithms for the past decade to distinguish the brain
patterns of healthy and SCZ brains using MRI and fMRI images. This paper seeks
to acquaint SCZ researchers with ML and to discuss its recent applications to
the field of SCZ study. This paper comprehensively reviews state-of-the-art
techniques such as ML classifiers, artificial neural network (ANN), deep
learning (DL) models, methodological fundamentals, and applications with
previous studies. The motivation of this paper is to benefit from finding the
research gaps that may lead to the development of a new model for accurate SCZ
diagnosis. The paper concludes with the research finding, followed by the
future scope that directly contributes to new research directions.

  COVID-19 by Trustful Data Collection in the Crowd","18 pages, 14 figures",,,,"cs.HC cs.GT cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS), through employing considerable workers to sense
and collect data in a participatory manner, has been recognized as a promising
paradigm for building many large-scale applications in a cost-effective way,
such as combating COVID-19. The recruitment of trustworthy and high-quality
workers is an important research issue for MCS. Previous studies assume that
the qualities of workers are known in advance, or the platform knows the
qualities of workers once it receives their collected data. In reality, to
reduce their costs and thus maximize revenue, many strategic workers do not
perform their sensing tasks honestly and report fake data to the platform. So,
it is very hard for the platform to evaluate the authenticity of the received
data. In this paper, an incentive mechanism named Semi-supervision based
Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit reverse Auction (SCMABA) is proposed to solve
the recruitment problem of multiple unknown and strategic workers in MCS.
First, we model the worker recruitment as a multi-armed bandit reverse auction
problem, and design an UCB-based algorithm to separate the exploration and
exploitation, considering the Sensing Rates (SRs) of recruited workers as the
gain of the bandit. Next, a Semi-supervised Sensing Rate Learning (SSRL)
approach is proposed to quickly and accurately obtain the workers' SRs, which
consists of two phases, supervision and self-supervision. Last, SCMABA is
designed organically combining the SRs acquisition mechanism with multi-armed
bandit reverse auction, where supervised SR learning is used in the
exploration, and the self-supervised one is used in the exploitation. We prove
that our SCMABA achieves truthfulness and individual rationality. Additionally,
we exhibit outstanding performances of the SCMABA mechanism through in-depth
simulations of real-world data traces.

cognition reflecting the quantum-classical nature of any process that generates
knowledge and learning governed by brain activity. Acknowledging the importance
of such a finding for modelization, we posit an approach to study brain by
means of the quantum-classical dynamics of a Mixed Weyl symbol. The Mixed Weyl
symbol is used to describe brain processes at the microscopic level and
provides a link to the results of measurements made at the mesoscopic scale.
Within this approach, quantum variables (such as,for example, nuclear and
electron spins, dipole momenta of particles or molecules, tunneling degrees of
freedom, etc may be represented by spinors while the electromagnetic fields and
phonon modes involved in the processes are treated either classically or
semi-classically, by also considering quantum zero-point fluctuations.
Zero-point quantum effects can be incorporated into numerical simulations by
controlling the temperature of each field mode via coupling to a dedicated
Nos\`e-Hoover chain thermostat. The temperature of each thermostat is chosen in
order to reproduce quantum statistics in the canonical ensemble. In this first
paper, we introduce a quantum-classical model of brain dynamics, clarifying its
mathematical strucure and focusing the discussion on its predictive value.
Analytical consequences of the model are not reported in this paper, since they
are left for future work. Our treatment incorporates compatible features of
three well-known quantum approaches to brain dynamics - namely the
electromagnetic field theory approach, the orchestrated objective reduction
theory, and the dissipative quantum model of the brain - and hints at
convincing arguments that sustain the existence of quantum-classical processes
in the brain activity. All three models are reviewed.

synthetic ECG for PxAF class in a certified manner. The effect of the certified
GAN is statistically validated. Instead of using a general-purpose classifier,
the NAS automatically designs a highly accurate convolutional neural network
architecture customized for the PxAF classification task. Experimental results
show that the accuracy of the proposed framework exhibits a high value of 99%
which not only enhances state-of-the-art by up to 5.1%, but also improves the
classification performance of the two widely-accepted baseline methods,
ResNet-18, and Auto-Sklearn, by 2.2% and 6.1%.

have near or better performance than state of the art Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs) on Automatic Speech Recognition tasks. These models tend to be lighter
weight and require less training time than traditional RNN-based approaches.
However, these models take frequentist approach to weight training. In theory,
network weights are drawn from a latent, intractable probability distribution.
We introduce BayesSpeech for end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition.
BayesSpeech is a Bayesian Transformer Network where these intractable
posteriors are learned through variational inference and the local
reparameterization trick without recurrence. We show how the introduction of
variance in the weights leads to faster training time and near state-of-the-art
performance on LibriSpeech-960.

Mailybaev","Post-blowup dynamics for the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation",,,,,"nlin.PS math-ph math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this work we present a systematic numerical study of the post-blowup
dynamics of singular solutions of the 1D focusing critical NLS equation in the
framework of a nonlinear damped perturbation. The first part of this study
shows that initially the post-blowup is described by the adiabatic
approximation, in which the collapsing core approaches an universal profile and
the solution width is governed by a system of ODEs (reduced system). After
that, a non-adiabatic regime is observed soon after the maximum of the
solution, in which our direct numerical simulations show a clear deviation from
the dynamics based on the reduced system. Our study suggests that such
non-adiabatic regime is caused by the increasing influx of mass into the
collapsing core of the solution, which is not considered in the derivation of
the reduced system. Also, adiabatic theoretical predictions related to the
wave-maximum and wave-dissipation are compared with our numerical simulations.
The second part of this work describes the non-adiabatic dynamics. Here,
numerical simulations reveal a dominant quasi linear regime, caused by the
rapid defocusing process. The collapsing core approaches the universal profile,
after removing some oscillations resulting from the interference with the tail.
Finally, our numerical study suggests that in the limit of vanishing
dissipation, and in a free-space domain, the critical mass is radiated to
infinity instantly at the collapse time.

randomized algorithm for computing a generalized CUR decomposition, which
provides low-rank approximations of both matrices simultaneously in terms of

store and manipulate, a new variant of the discrete empirical interpolation
method known as L-DEIM, which needs much lower cost and provides a significant
acceleration in practice, is also combined with the random sampling approach to
further improve the efficiency of our algorithm. Moreover, adopting the
randomized algorithm to implement the truncation process of restricted singular

fast algorithm for computing an RSVD based CUR decomposition, which provides a
coordinated low-rank approximation of the three matrices in a CUR-type format
simultaneously and provides advantages over the standard CUR approximation for
some applications. We establish detailed probabilistic error analysis for the
algorithms and provide numerical results that show the promise of our
approaches.

prediction. However, practical application of these models can be hindered by a
lack of information about how well they will perform on previously unseen types
of materials. Because machine learning model predictions depend on the quality
of the available training data, different domains of the material feature space
are predicted with different accuracy levels by such models. The ability to
identify such domains enables the ability to find the confidence level of each
prediction, to determine when and how the model should be employed depending on
the prediction accuracy requirements of different tasks, and to improve the
model for domains with high errors. In this work, we propose a method to find
domains of applicability using a large feature space and also introduce
analysis techniques to gain more insight into the detected domains and

Over the years, numerous solutions have arisen, many of them requiring new
programming languages, extensions to programming languages, or the addition of
pragmas. Support for these various tools and extensions is available to a
varying degree. In recent years, the C++ standards committee has worked to
refine the language features and libraries needed to support parallel
programming on a single computational node. Eventually, all major vendors and
compilers will provide robust and performant implementations of these
standards. Until then, the HPX library and runtime provides cutting edge
implementations of the standards, as well as proposed standards and extensions.
Because of these advances, it is now possible to write high performance
parallel code without custom extensions to C++. We provide an overview of
modern parallel programming in C++, describing the language and library
features, and providing brief examples of how to use them.

efficiency of program executing and memory arrangement in modern operating

self-balloning, Zballoning and so on. However, these methods which are based on
virtual machine usually cause a large overhead. Thus, using those methods to
estimate WSS is impractical. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to
efficiently estimate WSS with eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter), a
cutting-edge technology which monitors and filters data by being attached to
the kernel. With an eBPF program pinned into the kernel, we get the times of
page fault and other information of memory allocation. Moreover, we collect WSS
via vanilla tool to train a predictive model to complete estimation work with
LightGBM, a useful tool which performs well on generating decision trees over
continuous value. The experimental results illustrate that our framework can
estimate WSS precisely with 98.5\% reduction in overhead compared to
traditional methods.

have a pH value above 7, higher values of DO, lower values of BOD & FCC (Faecal

improved in most Indian rivers. There was no discharge of industrial wastes,
hotels/restaurants wastes, immersing of idols during religious festivals, etc.,

  Method","in Chinese language",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The continuous changes in the world have resulted in the performance
regression of neural networks. Therefore, continual learning (CL) area
gradually attracts the attention of more researchers. For edge intelligence,
the CL model not only needs to overcome catastrophic for-getting, but also
needs to face the huge challenge of severely limited resources: the lack of
labeled resources and powerful devices. However, the existing classic CL
methods usually rely on a large number of labeled samples to maintain the
plasticity and stability, and the semi-supervised learning methods often need
to pay a large computational and memory overhead for higher accuracy. In
response to these prob-lems, a low-cost semi-supervised CL method named Edge
Hierarchical Memory Learner (EdgeHML) will be proposed. EdgeHML can
effec-tively utilize a large number of unlabeled samples and a small number of
labeled samples. It is based on a hierarchical memory pool, lever-age
multi-level storage structure to store and replay samples. EdgeHML implements
the interaction between different levels through a combination of online and
offline strategies. In addition, in order to further reduce the computational
overhead for unlabeled samples, EdgeHML leverages a progressive learning
method. It reduces the computation cycles of unlabeled samples by controlling
the learning process. The experimental results show that on three
semi-supervised CL tasks, EdgeHML can improve the model accuracy by up to
16.35% compared with the classic CL method, and the training iterations time
can be reduced by more than 50% compared with semi-supervised methods. EdgeHML
achieves a semi-supervised CL process with high performance and low overhead
for edge intelligence.

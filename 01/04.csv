language processing applications. Commonsense knowledge graphs (CKG) are a
special type of KG, where entities and relations are composed of free-form
text. However, previous works in KG completion and CKG completion suffer from
long-tail relations and newly-added relations which do not have many know
triples for training. In light of this, few-shot KG completion (FKGC), which
requires the strengths of graph representation learning and few-shot learning,
has been proposed to challenge the problem of limited annotated data. In this
paper, we comprehensively survey previous attempts on such tasks in the form of
a series of methods and applications. Specifically, we first introduce FKGC
challenges, commonly used KGs, and CKGs. Then we systematically categorize and
summarize existing works in terms of the type of KGs and the methods. Finally,
we present applications of FKGC models on prediction tasks in different areas
and share our thoughts on future research directions of FKGC.

services such as location-aware communication networks, modern convenience, and
public safety. We consider wireless networks with mobile agents that aim to
localize themselves by performing pairwise measurements amongst agents and
exchanging their location information. Belief propagation (BP) is a
state-of-the-art Bayesian method for CL. In CL, particle-based implementations
of BP often are employed that can cope with non-linear measurement models and
state dynamics. However, particle-based BP algorithms are known to suffer from
particle degeneracy in large and dense networks of mobile agents with
high-dimensional states.
  This paper derives the messages of BP for CL by means of particle flow,
leading to the development of a distributed particle-based message-passing
algorithm which avoids particle degeneracy. Our combined particle flow-based BP
approach allows the calculation of highly accurate proposal distributions for
agent states with a minimal number of particles. It outperforms conventional
particle-based BP algorithms in terms of accuracy and runtime. Furthermore, we
compare the proposed method to a centralized particle flow-based
implementation, known as the exact Daum-Huang filter, and to sigma point BP in
terms of position accuracy, runtime, and memory requirement versus the network
size. We further contrast all methods to the theoretical performance limit
provided by the posterior Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (PCRLB). Based on three
different scenarios, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

although not predicted by standard theories of stellar formation, have been
observed in several classical T Tauri stars (cTTs). The low-mass cTTs DK Tau is
suspected of being among them. It is also an excellent subject to investigate
the interaction between stellar magnetic fields and material accreting from the
circumstellar disk, as it presents clear signatures of accretion. The goal of
this paper is to study DK Tau's average line-of-sight magnetic field (Blos) in
both photospheric absorption lines and emission lines linked to accretion,
using spectropolarimetric observations, as well as to examine inconsistencies
regarding its rotation axis. We used data collected with the ESPaDOnS and
NARVAL spectropolarimeters, probing two distinct epochs (2010 and 2012). We
first determined the stellar parameters, such as effective temperature and v
sin i. Next, we removed the effect of veiling from the spectra, then obtained
least-squares deconvolution profiles of the absorption lines, before
determining the Blos. We also investigated emission lines, the 587.6 nm HeI
line and the CaII infrared triplet, as tracers of the magnetic fields present
in the accretion shocks. We find that DK Tau experiences accretion onto a
magnetic pole at an angle of about 30 degrees from the pole of its rotation
axis, with a positive field at the base of the accretion funnels. In 2010 we
find a magnetic field of up to 1.77kG, and in 2012 up to 1.99kG. Additionally,
using our derived values of period, v sin i and stellar radius, we find a value
of 58 degrees (+18)(-11) for the inclination of the stellar rotation axis,
which is significantly different from the outer disk axis inclination of 21
degrees given in the literature. We find that DK Tau's outer disk axis is
likely misaligned compared to its rotation axis by 37 degrees.

temporal variability may provide a unique way to discriminate the imprint of
the inner engine activity from geometry and propagation related effects. We
define the minimum variability timescale (MVT) as the shortest duration of
individual pulses that shape a light curve for a sample of GRBs and test
correlations with peak luminosity, Lorentz factor, and jet opening angle. We
compare these correlations with predictions from recent numerical simulations
for a relativistic structured -- possibly wobbling -- jet and assess the value
of MTV as probe of prompt-emission physics. We used the peak detection
algorithm mepsa to identify the shortest pulse within a GRB time history and
estimate its full width half maximum (FWHM). We applied this framework to two
sets of GRBs: Swift (from 2005 to July 2022) and Insight-HXMT (from June 2017
to July 2021, including 221009A). We then selected 401 GRBs with measured z to
test for correlations. On average short GRBs have significantly shorter MVT
than long GRBs. The MVT distribution of short GRBs with extended emission such
as 060614 and 211211A is compatible only with that of short GRBs. This provides
a new clue on the progenitor's nature. The MVT for long GRBs anticorrelates
with peak luminosity. We confirm the anticorrelation with the Lorentz factor
and find a correlation with the jet opening angle as estimated from the
afterglow, along with an inverse correlation with the number of pulses. The MVT
can identify the emerging putative new class of long GRBs that are suggested to
be produced by compact binary mergers. For otherwise typical long GRBs, the
different correlations between MVT and peak luminosity, Lorentz factor, jet
opening angle, and number of pulses can be explained within the context of
structured, possibly wobbling, weakly magnetised relativistic jets.

offers several advantages compared to a traditional overlay (e.g. IP in IP), in
particular the possibility to use Traffic Engineering for the overlay tunnels.
In the paper, we provide the architecture and the detailed design of the SRv6

case of non-axisymmetric problems in an axisymmetric domain, described by
cylindrical coordinates. The method is based on a Fourier decomposition of the
source into a modal expansion and the evaluation of the corresponding modes of
the field using a two-dimensional tree decomposition in the radial and axial
coordinate. The field coefficients are evaluated using a modal Green's function
which can be evaluated using well-known recursions for the Legendre function of
the second kind, and whose derivatives can be found recursively using the
Laplace equation in cylindrical coordinates. The principal difference between
the cylindrical and Cartesian problems is the lack of translation invariance in
the evaluation of local interactions, leading to an increase in computational
effort for the axisymmetric domain. Results are presented for solution accuracy
and convergence and for computation time compared to direct evaluation. The
method is found to converge well, with ten digit accuracy being achieved for
the test cases presented. Computation time is controlled by the balance between
initialization and the evaluation of local interactions between source and
field points, and is about two orders of magnitude less than that required for
direct evaluation, depending on expansion order.

transfer, dust extinction based on Mie scattering, grain growth and ablation,
gas-to-dust drift using one mean grain size, a piston that simulates stellar
pulsations, and an accurate high spatial resolution numerical scheme. To enable
this study, we calculated new gas opacities based on the ExoMol database, and
we extended the model code to handle the formation of minerals that may form in
M-type stars. We discern effects of drift by comparing drift models to our new
and extant non-drift models. Three out of four new drift models show high drift
velocities, 87-310 km/s. Our new drift model mass-loss rates are 1.7-13 per
cent of the corresponding values of our non-drift models, but compared to
results of two extant non-drift models that use the same stellar parameters,
these same values are 0.33-1.5 per cent. Meanwhile, a comparison of other
properties such as the expansion velocity and grain size show similar values.
Our results, which are based on single-component forsterite particles, show
that the inclusion of gas-to-drift is of fundamental importance in stellar wind
models driven by such transparent grains. Assuming that the drift velocity is
insignificant, properties such as the mass-loss rate may be off from more
realistic values by a factor fifty and more.

better optimize the regression issue to align with the law of human learning

experimental results indicate that the performance of PMT-IQA is superior to
the comparison approaches, and both MS and PMT modules improve the model's

astrophysical laboratories, which allow us to study the physics of
collisionless shocks, thanks to their bright electromagnetic emission. Blast
wave shocks generated by supernovae (SNe) provide us with an observational
window to study extreme conditions, characterized by high Mach (and Alfvenic
Mach) numbers, together with powerful nonthermal processes. In collisionless
shocks, temperature equilibration between different species may not be reached
at the shock front. In this framework, different particle species might be
heated at different temperatures (depending on their mass) in the post-shock
medium of SNRs. SNRs are also characterized by a broadband nonthermal emission
stemming at the shock front as a result of nonthermal populations of leptons
and hadrons. These particles, known as cosmic rays, are accelerated up to
ultrarelativistic energies via diffusive shock acceleration. If SNRs lose a
significant fraction of their ram energy to accelerate cosmic rays, the shock
dynamics should be altered with respect to the adiabatic case. This shock
modification should result in an increase of the total shock compression ratio
with respect to the Rankine-Hugoniot value of 4. Here I show that the
combination of X-ray high resolution spectroscopy (to measure ion temperatures)
and moderate resolution spectroscopy (for a detailed diagnostic of the
post-shock density) can be exploited to study both the heating mechanism and
the particle acceleration in collisionless shocks. I report on new results in
the temperatures measured for different ion species in the remnant of SN 1987A.
I also discuss evidence of shock modification recently obtained in the remnant
of SN 1006 a. D., where the shock compression ratio increases significantly as
the angle between the shock velocity and the ambient magnetic field is reduced.

of tramp elements, was investigated as a potential cause and none was found.
Only a small amount of Mn rejection from partitioning was observed at the

found to occur more readily in the Low C Charpy specimen. Therefore it is
concluded that the use of C to promote TWIP$+$TRIP behaviour should be avoided

  note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2005.09057",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Screen recordings of mobile applications are easy to obtain and capture a
wealth of information pertinent to software developers (e.g., bugs or feature
requests), making them a popular mechanism for crowdsourced app feedback. Thus,
these videos are becoming a common artifact that developers must manage. In
light of unique mobile development constraints, including swift release cycles
and rapidly evolving platforms, automated techniques for analyzing all types of
rich software artifacts provide benefit to mobile developers. Unfortunately,
automatically analyzing screen recordings presents serious challenges, due to
their graphical nature, compared to other types of (textual) artifacts. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces V2S+, an automated approach for
translating video recordings of Android app usages into replayable scenarios.
V2S+ is based primarily on computer vision techniques and adapts recent
solutions for object detection and image classification to detect and classify
user gestures captured in a video, and convert these into a replayable test
scenario. Given that V2S+ takes a computer vision-based approach, it is
applicable to both hybrid and native Android applications. We performed an
extensive evaluation of V2S+ involving 243 videos depicting 4,028 GUI-based
actions collected from users exercising features and reproducing bugs from a
collection of over 90 popular native and hybrid Android apps. Our results
illustrate that V2S+ can accurately replay scenarios from screen recordings,
and is capable of reproducing $\approx$ 90.2% of sequential actions recorded in
native application scenarios on physical devices, and $\approx$ 83% of
sequential actions recorded in hybrid application scenarios on emulators, both
with low overhead. A case study with three industrial partners illustrates the
potential usefulness of V2S+ from the viewpoint of developers.

techniques mainly aim at achieving the best trade-off between resource usage
efficiency and model utility. The security risks stemming from them have not
been explored. This study performs the first backdoor attack against the models
trained on the data distilled by dataset distillation models in the image
domain. Concretely, we inject triggers into the synthetic data during the
distillation procedure rather than during the model training stage, where all
previous attacks are performed. We propose two types of backdoor attacks,
namely NAIVEATTACK and DOORPING. NAIVEATTACK simply adds triggers to the raw
data at the initial distillation phase, while DOORPING iteratively updates the
triggers during the entire distillation procedure. We conduct extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets, architectures, and dataset distillation
techniques. Empirical evaluation shows that NAIVEATTACK achieves decent attack
success rate (ASR) scores in some cases, while DOORPING reaches higher ASR
scores (close to 1.0) in all cases. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive
ablation study to analyze the factors that may affect the attack performance.
Finally, we evaluate multiple defense mechanisms against our backdoor attacks
and show that our attacks can practically circumvent these defense mechanisms.

tighten bounds showing that certain first quantized quantum algorithms enable

polynomially fewer operations in basis set size than conventional real-time

sample observables in the quantum algorithm reduces the speedup, we show that
one can estimate all elements of the $k$-particle reduced density matrix with a

system of a parallel hybrid electric vehicle based on model predictive control.
Its task is to minimize the vehicle's fuel consumption along a predicted
driving mission by calculating the distribution of the driver's power request
between the electrical and the combustive part of the powertrain, and by
choosing the driving mode, which depends on the vehicle's clutch state. The
inclusion of the clutch state in a model predictive control structure is not
trivial because the underlying optimization problem becomes a mixed-integer
program as a consequence. Using Pontryagin's Minimum Principle and a simplified
vehicle model, it is possible to prove that a drive cycle-dependent critical
power request Pcrit exists, which uniquely separates the optimal driving mode.
Based on this result, a learning algorithm is proposed to determine Pcrit
during the operation of the vehicle. The learning algorithm is incorporated
into a multi-level controller structure and the working principle of the
resulting multi-level learning-based model predictive controller is analyzed in
detail using two realistic driving missions. A comparison to the solution
obtained by Dynamic Programming reveals that the proposed controller achieves
close-to-optimal performance.

remove unwanted artifacts without smoothing away key features of the data set.
In this article, we present a method of model regularization that preserves

Our method varies the strength of a smoothing parameter throughout the domain
automatically, removing artifacts in poorly-constrained regions while leaving

regularization terms based on first and second derivatives to maintain model
accuracy while minimizing numerical artifacts. The behavior of our method is
validated on a collection of two- and three-dimensional data sets produced by
scientific simulations. In addition, a key tuning parameter is highlighted and

spins. As an illustration, we consider two small, n-doped InSb nanoparticles
under illumination by two counter-propagating plane waves. Remarkably, when an
external magnetic field exists, the symmetry in the system is broken, and a
resonant radiation pressure for the dimer appears. Similarly, tunable
inter-particle forces and spins are exerted on the non-reciprocal dimer. The
system is also characterized when the magnetic field is absent. Moreover, we
show how the mechanical observables truly characterize the dimer since their
resonance dependency contains detailed information about the system. Unlike
far-field observables like absorption, mechanical magnitudes depend on the
system's near-field. In addition, the nature of the particle spins is
originally explained by the energy flow's behavior around the dimer. This work
constitutes a generalization of any previous approach to optical binding
between small nanoparticles. It paves the way for fully controlling optical

different types of granularity trees, and different frames of reference.
Semantic units support making statements about statements, can be used for
graph-alignment, subgraph-matching, knowledge graph profiling, and for managing
access restrictions to sensitive data. Organizing the graph into semantic units
supports the separation of ontological, diagnostic (i.e., referential), and

characterize failure types, identify the modality used to report the

describing the electromagnetic near-field enhancement of scatterers associated

which is valid to deduce the integrated near-field CD enhancements of chiral

near-field fCD factor can be related to magnitudes that can be computed in the

value. Moreover, we show that in the case of lossless cylindrically symmetric

deal of applications concerned, such as disease spreading and rumor dynamics.
That is why, a plethora of centrality measures has emerged over the years in
order to rank nodes according to their topological importance in the network.
Local metrics such as degree centrality make use of a very limited information
and are easy to compute. Global metrics such as betweenness centrality exploit
the information of the whole network structure at the cost of a very high
computational complexity. Recent works have shown that combining multiple
metrics is a promising strategy to quantify the node's influential ability. Our
work is in this line. In this paper, we introduce a multi-attributes centrality
measure called M-Centrality that combines the information on the position of
the node in the network with the local information on its nearest neighborhood.
The position is measured by the K-shell decomposition, and the degree variation
in the neighborhood of the node quantifies the influence of the local context.
In order to examine the performances of the proposed measure, we conduct
experiments on small and large scale real-world networks from the perspectives
of transmission dynamics and network connectivity. According to the empirical
results, the M-Centrality outperforms its alternatives in identifying both
influential spreaders and nodes essential to maintain the network connectivity.
In addition, its low computational complexity makes it easily applied to large
scale networks.

vulnerabilities. Finally, test cases are run, and their execution is assessed
by a specific oracle, in order to reveal whether the vulnerability could be
successfully exploited. The proposed novel approach has been implemented and
evaluated on a set of case studies written in different programming languages.
The evaluation highlights that the approach is quite effective in detecting
seeded vulnerabilities, with a remarkably high accuracy.

Thanks to more than 20 years of monitoring, the radial velocity (RV)
method has detected long-period companions (P > 10yr) around several dozens of
stars. Yet, the true nature of these companions remains unclear because of the
uncertainty as to the inclination of the companion orbital plane. Aims. We wish
to constrain the orbital inclination and the true mass of long-period single
companions. Methods. We used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting
algorithm to combine RV measurements with absolute astrometry and, when
available, relative astrometry data. Results. We have lifted the sin(i)
indetermination for 7 seven long-period companions. We find true masses in the
planetary mass range for the candidate planets detected in the following
systems: Epsilon Indi A, HD 13931, HD 115954, and HD 222155. The mass of HD
219077 b is close to the deuterium-burning limit and its nature is uncertain
because of the imprecise mass of the host star. Using additional RV
measurements, we refine the orbital parameters of HIP 70849 b and find a mass
in the planetary range. By combining RV data with absolute and relative
astrometry, we significantly improve the characterization of HD 211847 B and
properly determine its mass, which appears to be in the low-mass star range.
This work illustrates how Gaia and Hipparcos allow for the orbital properties

microbutubules with their minus ends collected and stabilized by a microtubule
organizing center (MTOC) in the interior of the cell. This arrangement enables
the ballistic transport of cargo bound to microtubules, both dynein mediated
transport towards the MTOC and kinesin mediated transport away from it,
interspersed with diffusion for unbound cargo-motor complexes. Spatial and
temporal positioning of the MTOC allows for bidirectional transport towards and
away from specific organelles and locations within the cell and also the
sequestering and subsequent dispersal of dynein transported cargo. The general
principles governing dynamics, efficiency and tunability of such transport in
the MTOC vicinity is not fully understood. To address this, we develop a
one-dimensional model that includes advective transport towards an attractor
(such as the MTOC), and diffusive transport that allows particles to reach
absorbing boundaries (such as cellular membranes). We calculated the mean first
passage time (MFPT) for cargo to reach the boundaries as a measure of the
effectiveness of sequestering (large MFPT) and diffusive dispersal (low MFPT).
The MFPT experiences a dramatic growth in magnitude, transitioning from a low
to high MFPT regime (dispersal to sequestering) over a window of cargo
attachment/detachment rates that is close to in vivo values. We find that
increasing either the attachment or detachment rate, while fixing the other,
can result in optimal dispersal when the attractor is placed asymmetrically.
Finally, we describe a rare event regime, where the escape location is
exponentially sensitive to the attractor positioning. Our results suggest that
structures such as the MTOC allow for the sensitive control of the spatial and
temporal features of transport and corresponding function under physiological
conditions.

associated apsidal precession, significantly reduces the radial range of polar

range of 3-10 times the outer binary separation depending upon the binary
parameters, the orbits behave the same as they do around a circular orbit

quantitative constraints on the efficiency of the non-thermal desorption of
this species. With physical parameters determined from available Herschel data,
we computed abundance maps of 11 detected molecules with a non-local thermal

the molecular abundances as a function of density and visual extinction, with
the variation in temperature being restrained between 12 and 18 K. We then
compared the observed abundances to the predictions of the Nautilus

densities and visual extinctions with respect to lower density regions, except
for methanol. Comparing these observations with a grid of chemical models based
on the local physical conditions, we were able to reproduce these observations,
allowing only the parameter time to vary. Comparing the observed gas-phase
abundance of methanol with previous measurements of the methanol ice, we
estimate a non-thermal desorption efficiency between 0.002% and 0.09%,
increasing with density. The apparent increase in the desorption efficiency

and $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr collisions at two energies $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=0.2$
TeV and 5.02 TeV, where $^{96}$Ru and $^{96}$Zr nuclei have significantly
different deformations and radial profiles, we identify sources of
eccentricities contributing independently to the final state harmonic flow
$v_n$. The efficacy for flow generation is different amount these sources,

In this paper, we explore distillation techniques to transfer the success of
large MIM-based pre-trained models to smaller ones. We systematically study
different options in the distillation framework, including distilling targets,
losses, input, network regularization, sequential distillation, etc, revealing
that: 1) Distilling token relations is more effective than CLS token- and
feature-based distillation; 2) An intermediate layer of the teacher network as
target perform better than that using the last layer when the depth of the
student mismatches that of the teacher; 3) Weak regularization is preferred;
etc. With these findings, we achieve significant fine-tuning accuracy
improvements over the scratch MIM pre-training on ImageNet-1K classification,
using all the ViT-Tiny, ViT-Small, and ViT-base models, with +4.2%/+2.4%/+1.4%

supermassive black hole (SMBH), with closer encounters resulting in larger
perturbations. Exciting these tides comes at the expense of the star's orbital
energy, which leads to the naive conclusion that a smaller pericenter (i.e., a
closer encounter between the star and SMBH) always yields a more tightly bound
star to the SMBH. However, once the pericenter distance is small enough that
the star is partially disrupted, morphological asymmetries in the mass lost by
the star can yield an \emph{increase} in the orbital energy of the surviving
core, resulting in its ejection -- not capture -- by the SMBH. Using
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations, we show that the combination of
these two effects -- tidal excitation and asymmetric mass loss -- result in a
maximum amount of energy lost through tides of $\sim 2.5\%$ of the binding
energy of the star, which is significantly smaller than the theoretical maximum
of the total stellar binding energy. This result implies that stars that are
repeatedly partially disrupted by SMBHs many ($\gtrsim 10$) times on
short-period orbits ($\lesssim$ few years), as has been invoked to explain the
periodic nuclear transient ASASSN-14ko and quasi-periodic eruptions, must be
bound to the SMBH through a mechanism other than tidal capture, such as a
dynamical exchange (i.e., Hills capture).

early quenching of star formation in GE/S. Due to a more protracted history of
star formation, stars in the metal-rich end of the MW satellite populations are
characterized by lower [Mg/Mn] than those of their GE/S counterparts. The
chemical compositions of GE/S stars are consistent with a higher early star
formation rate than MW satellites of comparable and even higher mass,
suggesting that star formation in the early universe was strongly influenced by
other parameters in addition to mass. We find that the direction of the

utterly expected given that before being evolved into a fully non-linear z=0

solely linear theory, power spectrum and highly uncertain and sparse local
peculiar velocities. Additionally, Gaussian fits to velocity wave envelopes
show that wave properties are tightly tangled with cluster masses. This link is
complex though and involves the environment and formation history of the

correlated with the size and arrangement of moir\'e patterns. While rigid
rotation of two layers creates the topology of moir\'e patterns, local
rearrangements of the atoms due to interlayer van der Waals interactions result
in atomic reconstruction within the moir\'e cells. The ability to manipulate
these patterns by controlling twist angle and/or externally applied strain
provides a promising route to tune their properties. While this phenomenon has
been extensively studied for angles close to or smaller than the magic angle
({\theta}m=1.1{\deg}), its extent for higher angles and how it evolves with
strain is unknown and is believed to be mostly absent at high angles. We use
theoretical and numerical analyses to resolve reconstruction in angles above

propose a method to identify local regions within moir\'e cells and track their
evolution with strain for a range of representative high twist angles. Our
results show that reconstruction is actively present beyond the magic angle and
its contribution to the evolution of the moir\'e cells is major. Our
theoretical method to correlate local and global phonon behavior provides
further validation on the role of reconstruction at higher angles. Our findings
provide a better understanding of moir\'e reconstruction in large twist angles

Douglass","Network-theoretic modeling of fluid-structure interactions","20 pages, 9 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The coupling interactions between deformable structures and unsteady fluid
flows occur across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales in many
engineering applications. These fluid-structure interactions (FSI) make it
challenging to predict flow physics accurately. In the present work, two
multi-layer network approaches are proposed that characterize the interactions
between the fluid and structural layers for an incompressible laminar flow over
a two-dimensional compliant flat plate at a 35-degrees angle of attack. In one
approach, the wake vortices and bound vortexlets form the nodes of the network
with the edges defined by induced velocity. In the other approach, coherent
structures (fluid modes) contributing to the kinetic energy of the flow and
structural modes contributing to the kinetic energy of the compliant structure
constitute the network nodes. The energy transfers between the modes are
extracted using a perturbation approach. The network structure of the FSI
system is further simplified using the community detection algorithm in the
vortical approach and by selecting dominant modes in the modal approach.
Network measures are used to reveal the temporal behavior of the individual
nodes within the simplified FSI system. Predictive models are then built using
both data-driven and physics-based methods. We conclude by investigating the
controllability of the modal interaction network. This work sets the foundation
for network-theoretic reduced-order modeling of fluid-structure interactions,
generalizable to other multi-physics systems.

memory cost, sometimes even becoming prohibitive. To overcome this, we propose
the use of \textit{Conditional Neural Stochastic Differential Equations}, which
have a constant memory cost as a function of depth, being more memory efficient
than traditional deep learning architectures. We empirically test that this
proposed model is more efficient than other classical approaches, both in terms
of memory cost and computational time, and that it usually outperforms them in

the vulnerability to the public could harm the system's users; whereas
disclosing the vulnerability only to the software's vendor lets the vendor

unwittingly-affected users. A compelling recent line of work aims to resolve
this by using Zero Knowledge (ZK) protocols that let analysts prove that they
know a vulnerability in a program, without revealing the details of the
vulnerability or the inputs that exploit it. In principle, this could be
achieved by generic ZK techniques. In practice, ZK vulnerability proofs to date
have been restricted in scope and expressibility, due to challenges related to
generating proof statements that model real-world software at scale and to
directly formulating violated properties. This paper presents CHEESECLOTH, a
novel proofstatement compiler, which proves practical vulnerabilities in ZK by
soundly-but-aggressively preprocessing programs on public inputs, selectively
revealing information about executed control segments, and formalizing
information leakage using a novel storage-labeling scheme. CHEESECLOTH's
practicality is demonstrated by generating ZK proofs of well-known

This is interpreted as structures in expansion that are visible in the front
hemisphere and sometimes also in the back hemisphere. We model the plasma
distribution together with its associated velocities through an inversion
algorithm to fit the observed linear polarization. Results. We find that
supposing the existence of plasma beyond the limb rising high enough to be
visible above it can explain the observed linear polarization signatures as
well as their evolution in time. From this we are able to infer the geometric
heights of the convective plumes and establish that this hot plasma rises to at
least 1.1 R*. Conclusions. $\mu$ Cep appears to be in an active phase in which
plasma rises often above 1.1 R* . We generalize this result to all red
supergiants in a similarly evolved stage, which at certain epochs may easily
send plasma to greater heights, as $\mu$ Cep appears to be doing at present.

Results. We identify only three LAEs at z = 4.3 in this field, in concordance

spatially associated with core of the protocluster. All the
previously-identified DSFGs in this field are undetected in Lyman-$\alpha$

find an extended Lyman-$\alpha$ structure, about $60 \times 60$ kpc$^{2}$ in

spectral variation can in turn be readily employed to control and switch the

in which the defender can allocate deceptive targets and modify the cost of
actions for the attacker who aims to compromise security assets in this system.
We model the interaction of the attacker and the system using a formal security
model -- a probabilistic attack graph. By allocating fake targets/decoys, the
defender aims to distract the attacker from compromising true targets. By
increasing the cost of some attack actions, the defender aims to discourage the
attacker from committing to certain policies and thereby improve the defense.
To optimize the defense given limited decoy resources and operational
constraints, we formulate the synthesis problem as a bi-level optimization
problem, while the defender designs the system, in anticipation of the
attacker's best response given that the attacker has disinformation about the
system due to the use of deception. Though the general formulation with
bi-level optimization is NP-hard, we show that under certain assumptions, the
problem can be transformed into a constrained optimization problem. We proposed
an algorithm to approximately solve this constrained optimization problem using
a novel incentive-design method for projected gradient ascent. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method using extensive numerical experiments.

proposed in the 1980's, have become the standard visual classification model.
Recently, as alternatives to CNNs, Capsule Networks (CapsNets) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have been proposed. CapsNets, which were inspired by the
information processing of the human brain, are considered to have more
inductive bias than CNNs, whereas ViTs are considered to have less inductive
bias than CNNs. All three classification models have received great attention
since they can serve as backbones for various downstream tasks. However, these
models are far from being perfect. As pointed out by the community, there are
two weaknesses in standard Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). One of the limitations
of DNNs is the lack of explainability. Even though they can achieve or surpass
human expert performance in the image classification task, the DNN-based
decisions are difficult to understand. In many real-world applications,
however, individual decisions need to be explained. The other limitation of
DNNs is adversarial vulnerability. Concretely, the small and imperceptible
perturbations of inputs can mislead DNNs. The vulnerability of deep neural
networks poses challenges to current visual classification models. The
potential threats thereof can lead to unacceptable consequences. Besides,
studying model adversarial vulnerability can lead to a better understanding of
the underlying models. Our research aims to address the two limitations of
DNNs. Specifically, we focus on deep visual classification models, especially
the core building parts of each classification model, e.g. dynamic routing in

capturing both impacts using two independent analyses: 1) a least-squares

CH4 emissions at 7.9 um, due to shock heating and adiabatic compression from
plume re-entry, and from 8.5 - 11.5 um due to stratospheric NH3 emission and
non-gaseous cometary material. We derive NH3 concentrations of 5.7 ppmv at 30

non-gaseous emission feature at 18 - 19 um. The non-gaseous emission at 8.5 -
11.5 and 18 - 19 um emission is best reproduced by predominantly amorphous

enhanced emissions from 8.8 - 11.5 and 18 - 19 um. We found this could be

concentrations of 150 ppbv at 30 mbar. Stratospheric NH3 abundances are a
factor of 40 higher in the SL9 impacts compared to the Wesley impact, which
confirms the former reached deeper, NH3-richer altitudes of the atmosphere. The

to traverse approximately 2000 km in the South Pole-Aitkin (SPA) Basin, with
individual drives of several kilometers between stops for downlink. These rover
mission scenarios require functionality that provides onboard, autonomous,
global position knowledge ( aka absolute localization). However, planetary
rovers have no onboard global localization capability to date; they have only
used relative localization, by integrating combinations of wheel odometry,
visual odometry, and inertial measurements during each drive to track position
relative to the start of each drive. In this work, we summarize recent
developments from the LunarNav project, where we have developed algorithms and
software to enable lunar rovers to estimate their global position and heading

crater matching, and 3) state estimation. In previous work, we developed crater

based on a linear trend with the average rate. The traditional statistical
approach utilizes the simple Poisson-Gamma model that assumes time-invariant
site activation rates and it can fail to capture the underlying nonlinear
patterns (e.g., up and down site activation pattern). We present a novel
statistical approach based on generalized linear mixed-effects models and the
use of non-homogeneous Poisson processes through Bayesian framework to model
the country initiation, site activation and subject enrollment sequentially in

$3\times3\,\mathrm{{deg}^2}$ sub-fields from the first-year area, divide the
galaxies with redshift $0.3\le z\le1.5$ into four equally-spaced redshift bins,
and perform tomographic analyses. We develop a pipeline to generate simulated
convergence maps from cosmological $N$-body simulations, where we account for
effects such as intrinsic alignments (IAs), baryons, photometric redshift
errors, and point spread function errors, to match characteristics of the real
catalogue. We train CNNs that can predict the underlying parameters from the
simulated maps, and we use them to construct likelihood functions for Bayesian
analyses. In the $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model with two free cosmological
parameters $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ and $\sigma_8$, we find
$\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.278_{-0.035}^{+0.037}$,
$S_8\equiv(\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.5}\sigma_8=0.793_{-0.018}^{+0.017}$, and
the IA amplitude $A_\mathrm{IA}=0.20_{-0.58}^{+0.55}$. In a model with four
additional free baryonic parameters, we find
$\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.268_{-0.036}^{+0.040}$, $S_8=0.819_{-0.024}^{+0.034}$, and
$A_\mathrm{IA}=-0.16_{-0.58}^{+0.59}$, with the baryonic parameters not being
well-constrained. We also find that statistical uncertainties of the parameters
by the CNNs are smaller than those from the power spectrum (5--24 percent
smaller for $S_8$ and a factor of 2.5--3.0 smaller for $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$),
showing the effectiveness of CNNs for uncovering additional cosmological
information from the HSC data. With baryons, the $S_8$ discrepancy between HSC
first-year data and Planck 2018 is reduced from $\sim2.2\,\sigma$ to
$0.3\text{--}0.5\,\sigma$.

due to the composite k-space signals and the resulting images with strong
inter-slice artifacts. Furthermore, many dMRI applications lack sufficient data

DL-based framework for dynamic SMS reconstruction. Our main contributions are
1) a combination of data transformation steps and network design that
effectively leverages the unique characteristics of undersampled dynamic SMS

parallel biconnectivity algorithm is the Tarjan-Vishkin algorithm, which has
$O(n+m)$ optimal work (number of operations) and polylogarithmic span (longest

Tarjan-Vishkin is not widely used in practice. We believe the reason is the
space-inefficiency (it generates an auxiliary graph with $O(m)$ edges). In
practice, existing parallel implementations are based on breath-first search
(BFS). Since BFS has span proportional to the diameter of the graph, existing
parallel BCC implementations suffer from poor performance on large-diameter
graphs and can be even slower than the sequential algorithm on many real-world
graphs.
  We propose the first parallel biconnectivity algorithm (FAST-BCC) that has
optimal work, polylogarithmic span, and is space-efficient. Our algorithm first
generates a skeleton graph based on any spanning tree of the input graph. Then
we use the connectivity information of the skeleton to compute the
biconnectivity of the original input. All the steps in our algorithm are
highly-parallel. We carefully analyze the correctness of our algorithm, which
is highly non-trivial.
  We implemented FAST-BCC and compared it with existing implementations,
including GBBS, Slota and Madduri's algorithm, and the sequential
Hopcroft-Tarjan algorithm. We ran them on a 96-core machine on 27 graphs,
including social, web, road, $k$-NN, and synthetic graphs, with significantly
varying sizes and edge distributions. FAST-BCC is the fastest on all 27 graphs.
On average (geometric means), FAST-BCC is 5.1$\times$ faster than GBBS, and
3.1$\times$ faster than the best existing baseline on each graph.

parametric models asymptotically justified from extreme value theory (EVT).
These methods, while powerful and theoretically grounded, could however

In this paper, we study a framework based on the recently surging literature of
distributionally robust optimization. This approach can be viewed as a
nonparametric alternative to conventional EVT, by imposing general shape belief
on the tail instead of parametric assumption and using worst-case optimization
as a resolution to handle the nonparametric uncertainty. We explain how this
approach bypasses the bias-variance tradeoff in EVT. On the other hand, we face
a conservativeness-variance tradeoff which we describe how to tackle. We also
demonstrate computational tools for the involved optimization problems and

of modern quantum many-body physics, in relationship with fundamental questions
in quantum statistical mechanics, as well as with the fields of quantum
simulation and computing. In this work we propose a Gaussian Ansatz for the
study of the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum spin systems. Within our
approach, the quantum spins are mapped onto Holstein-Primakoff bosons, such
that a coherent spin state -- chosen as the initial state of the dynamics --
represents the bosonic vacuum. The state of the system is then postulated to
remain a bosonic Gaussian state at all times, an assumption which is exact when
the bosonic Hamiltonian is quadratic; and which is justified in the case of a
nonlinear Hamiltonian if the boson density remains moderate. We test the
accuracy of such an Ansatz in the paradigmatic case of the $S=1/2$
transverse-field Ising model, in one and two dimensions, initialized in a state
aligned with the applied field. We show that the Gaussian Ansatz, when applied
to the bosonic Hamiltonian with nonlinearities truncated to quartic order, is
able to reproduce faithfully the evolution of the state, including its
relaxation to the equilibrium regime, for fields larger than the critical field
for the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the ground state. In
particular the spatio-temporal pattern of correlations reconstructed via the
Gaussian Ansatz reveals the dispersion relation of quasiparticle excitations,
exhibiting the softening of the excitation gap upon approaching the critical
field. Our results suggest that the Gaussian Ansatz correctly captures the
essential effects of nonlinearities in quantum spin dynamics; and that it can
be applied to the study of fundamental phenomena such as quantum thermalization
and its breakdown.

with m items and n multi-unit demand agents with additive, unit-sum valuations.
The symmetric case (m=n), the one-sided matching problem, has been studied
extensively for the class of unit demand agents, in particular with respect to
the folklore Random Priority mechanism and the Probabilistic Serial mechanism,
introduced by Bogomolnaia and Moulin. Under the assumption of unit-sum
valuation functions, Christodoulou et al. proved that the price of anarchy is
$\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ in the one-sided matching problem for both the Random
Priority and Probabilistic Serial mechanisms. Whilst both Random Priority and
Probabilistic Serial are ordinal mechanisms, these approximation guarantees are
the best possible even for the broader class of cardinal mechanisms.
  To extend these results to the general setting there are two technical
obstacles. One, asymmetry ($m\neq n$) is problematic especially when the number
of items is much greater than the number of items. Two, it is necessary to
study multi-unit demand agents rather than simply unit demand agents. Our
approach is to study a cardinal mechanism variant of Probabilistic Serial,
which we call Cardinal Probabilistic Serial. We present structural theorems for
this mechanism and use them to obtain bounds on the price of anarchy. Our first
main result is an upper bound of $O(\sqrt{n}\cdot \log m)$ on the price of
anarchy for the asymmetric one-sided allocation problem with multi-unit demand
agents. This upper bound applies to Probabilistic Serial as well and there is a
complementary lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ for any fair mechanism. Our
second main result is that the price of anarchy degrades with the number of
items. Specifically, a logarithmic dependence on the number of items is
necessary for both mechanisms.

three-dimensional spaces such as the ocean. In the ocean, the variability of
the response may vary with depth, and ocean currents may lead to spatially
varying anisotropy. We construct a class of non-stationary anisotropic Gaussian
random fields (GRFs) in three dimensions through stochastic partial
differential equations (SPDEs) where computations are done using Gaussian
Markov random field approximations.
  The approach is proven in a simulation study where the amount of data
required to estimate these models is explored. Then, the method is applied to
construct a GRF prior on an ocean mass outside Trondheim, Norway, based on
simulations from the complex numerical ocean model SINMOD. This GRF prior is
compared to a stationary anisotropic GRF using in-situ measurements collected
with an autonomous underwater vehicle where our approach outperforms the
stationary anisotropic GRF for real-time prediction of unobserved locations.

statistical methods for analyzing modern brain-imaging play an important role
in the advancement of science. Imaging data that measure brain function are
usually multivariate time series and are heterogeneous across both imaging
sources and subjects, which lead to various statistical and computational
challenges. In this paper, we propose a group-based method to cluster a
collection of multivariate time series via a Bayesian mixture of smoothing
splines. Our method assumes each multivariate time series is a mixture of
multiple components with different mixing weights. Time-independent covariates
are assumed to be associated with the mixture components and are incorporated
via logistic weights of a mixture-of-experts model. We formulate this approach
under a fully Bayesian framework using Gibbs sampling where the number of
components is selected based on a deviance information criterion. The proposed
method is compared to existing methods via simulation studies and is applied to
a study on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), which aims to
understand infant emotional reactivity and recovery from stress. The results
reveal distinct patterns of brain activity, as well as associations between
these patterns and selected covariates.

detecting radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) amongst the ~30 submillimeter
galaxies identified in the structure. We detect the central complex of SMGs at
2.2\,GHz with a luminosity of L_2.2=(4.42pm0.56)x10^{25} W/Hz. The ASKAP also
detects the source at 888 MHz, constraining the radio spectral index to
alpha=-1.6pm0.3, consistent with ATCA non-detections at 5.5 and 9GHz, and
implying L_1.4(rest)=(2.4pm0.3)x10^{26}W/Hz. This radio luminosity is about 100
times higher than expected from star formation, assuming the usual FIR-radio
correlation, which is a clear indication of an AGN driven by a forming
brightest cluster galaxy (BCG). None of the SMGs in SPT2349-56 show signs of
AGN in any other diagnostics available to us (notably 12CO out to J=16,
OH163um, CII/IR, and optical spectra), highlighting the radio continuum as a
powerful probe of obscured AGN in high-z protoclusters. No other significant
radio detections are found amongst the cluster members, consistent with the
FIR-radio correlation. We compare these results to field samples of radio
sources and SMGs, along with the 22 SPT-SMG gravitational lenses also observed
in the ATCA program, as well as powerful radio galaxies at high redshifts. Our
results allow us to better understand the effects of this gas-rich, overdense
environment on early supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth and cluster
feedback. We estimate that (3.3pm0.7)x10^{38} W of power are injected into the
growing ICM by the radio-loud AGN, whose energy over 100Myr is comparable to
the binding energy of the gas mass of the central halo. The AGN power is also
comparable to the instantaneous energy injection from supernova feedback from
the 23 catalogued SMGs in the core region of 120kpc projected radius. The
SPT2349-56 radio-loud AGN may be providing strong feedback on a nascent ICM.

enabling a detailed spectral variation study of the flare rise. The flare in
September varies quickly in ~800 sec, while the flare in December has a few

show typical stellar X-ray flare variations with a rapid rise and slow decay,
while the soft X-ray light curves, especially of the September flare, have
prolonged flat peaks. The time-resolved spectra require two temperature plasma
components at kT ~0.3-1 keV and ~2-4 keV. Both components vary similarly, but
the cool component lags by ~200 sec with a 4-6 times smaller emission measure
(EM) compared to the hot component. A comparison with hydrodynamic flare loop
simulations indicates that the cool component originates from X-ray plasma near
the magnetic loop footpoints, which mainly cools via thermal conduction. The
time lag represents the travel time of the evaporated gas through the entire
flare loop. The cool component has several times smaller EM than its simulated
counterpart, suggesting a suppression of conductive cooling possibly by the
expansion of the loop cross-sectional area or turbulent fluctuations. The cool
component's time lag and small EM ratio provide important constraints on the

detection on egocentric (first-person) videos without any form of exocentric

the two domains, large-scale exocentric transferring has been the default
choice for egocentric action detection. This is because prior works found that
egocentric models are difficult to train from scratch and that transferring
from exocentric representations leads to improved accuracy. However, in this
paper, we revisit this common belief. Motivated by the large gap separating the
two domains, we propose a strategy that enables effective training of
egocentric models without exocentric transferring. Our Ego-Only approach is
simple. It trains the video representation with a masked autoencoder finetuned
for temporal segmentation. The learned features are then fed to an
off-the-shelf temporal action localization method to detect actions. We find
that this renders exocentric transferring unnecessary by showing remarkably
strong results achieved by this simple Ego-Only approach on three established
egocentric video datasets: Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-100, and Charades-Ego. On both
action detection and action recognition, Ego-Only outperforms previous best
exocentric transferring methods that use orders of magnitude more labels.
Ego-Only sets new state-of-the-art results on these datasets and benchmarks

Comments welcome",,"10.3847/1538-4357/acc384",,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have historically been divided into two classes.
Short-duration GRBs are associated with binary neutron-star mergers (NSMs),
while long-duration bursts are connected to a subset of core-collapse
supernovae (SNe). GRB 211211A recently made headlines as the first
long-duration burst purportedly generated by an NSM. The evidence for an NSM
origin was excess optical and near-infrared emission consistent with the
kilonova observed after the gravitational wave-detected NSM GW170817. Kilonovae
derive their unique electromagnetic signatures from the properties of the heavy
elements synthesized by rapid neutron capture (the r-process) following the
merger. Recent simulations suggest that the ""collapsar"" SNe that trigger long
GRBs may also produce r-process elements. While observations of GRB 211211A and
its afterglow ruled out an SN typical of those that follow long GRBs, an
unusual collapsar could explain both the duration of GRB 211211A and the
r-process-powered excess in its afterglow. We use semianalytic radiation
transport modeling to evaluate low-mass collapsars as the progenitors of GRB
211211A-like events. We compare a suite of collapsar models to the
afterglow-subtracted emission that followed GRB 211211A, and find the best
agreement for models with high kinetic energies and an unexpected pattern of
Ni-56 enrichment. We discuss how core-collapse explosions could produce such
ejecta, and how distinct our predictions are from those generated by more
straightforward kilonova models. We also show that radio observations can
distinguish between kilonovae and the more massive collapsar ejecta we consider
here.

via pool-based active learning, learns a distribution over reward functions,
and optimizes a corresponding policy via offline RL. Crucially, our proposed
approach does not require actual physical rollouts or an accurate simulator for
either the reward learning or policy optimization steps. To test our approach,
we first evaluate existing offline RL benchmarks for their suitability for
offline reward learning. Surprisingly, for many offline RL domains, we find
that simply using a trivial reward function results good policy performance,
making these domains ill-suited for evaluating learned rewards. To address
this, we identify a subset of existing offline RL benchmarks that are well
suited for offline reward learning and also propose new offline apprenticeship
learning benchmarks which allow for more open-ended behaviors. When evaluated
on this curated set of domains, our empirical results suggest that combining
offline RL with learned human preferences can enable an agent to learn to
perform novel tasks that were not explicitly shown in the offline data.

Comput. Phys. 384, 99 (2019)], following extensions take place: (1) an
tensor-producted basis set, which adopts PWs in the incommensurate dimensions,
and localized basis in the interlayer dimension, (2) a practical application of
a novel cutoff techniques we have recently developed, and (3) a quasi-band
structure picture under the small twisted angles and weak interlayer coupling
limits. With (1) and (2) now the dimensions of Hamiltonian matrix are reduced
by about 2 orders of magnitude compared with the original framework. And (3)
enables us to better organize the calculations and understand the results. For
numerical examples, we study the electronic structures of the linear bilayer
graphene lattice system with the magic twisted angle ($\sim 1.05^{\circ}$). The
famous flat bands have been reproduced with their features in quantitative
agreement with those from experiments and other theoretical calculations.
Moreover, the extended framework has much less computational cost compared to
the commensurate cell approximations, and is more extendable compared to the
traditional model hamiltonians and tight binding models. Finally this framework
can readily accommodate nonlinear models thus will laid the foundations for
more effective yet accurate Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.

dynamic games assumes an open-loop information pattern. In this work, we
demonstrate that the feedback Nash equilibrium concept is more expressive and
encodes more complex behavior. It is desirable to develop specific tools for
inferring players' objectives in feedback games. Therefore, we consider the
dynamic game cost inference problem under the feedback information pattern,

yields a feedback Nash equilibrium state trajectory closest to the observation

an efficient gradient approximator, which enables a novel inverse feedback game

most promising LNL methods rely on identifying clean-label samples from a
dataset with noisy annotations. Such an identification is challenging because
the conventional LNL problem, which assumes a single noisy label per instance,
is non-identifiable, i.e., clean labels cannot be estimated theoretically
without additional heuristics. In this paper, we aim to formally investigate
this identifiability issue using multinomial mixture models to determine the
constraints that make the problem identifiable. Specifically, we discover that
the LNL problem becomes identifiable if there are at least $2C - 1$ noisy
labels per instance, where $C$ is the number of classes. To meet this
requirement without relying on additional $2C - 2$ manual annotations per
instance, we propose a method that automatically generates additional noisy
labels by estimating the noisy label distribution based on nearest neighbours.
These additional noisy labels enable us to apply the Expectation-Maximisation
algorithm to estimate the posterior probabilities of clean labels, which are
then used to train the model of interest. We empirically demonstrate that our
proposed method is capable of estimating clean labels without any heuristics in
several label noise benchmarks, including synthetic, web-controlled, and
real-world label noises. Furthermore, our method performs competitively with

generative models have difficulty in capturing the data distribution of
underrepresented attribute compositions while over-memorizing overrepresented
attribute compositions, which raises public concerns about their robustness and
fairness. To tackle this challenge, we propose ACTIG, an attribute-centric
compositional text-to-image generation framework. We present an
attribute-centric feature augmentation and a novel image-free training scheme,
which greatly improves model's ability to generate images with underrepresented
attributes. We further propose an attribute-centric contrastive loss to avoid
overfitting to overrepresented attribute compositions. We validate our
framework on the CelebA-HQ and CUB datasets. Extensive experiments show that
the compositional generalization of ACTIG is outstanding, and our framework
outperforms previous works in terms of image quality and text-image
consistency.

However, physically relevant states, i.e, the eigenstates of the Schr\""odinger

these eigenstates form a low-dimensional subspace of the entire Hilbert space.
The geometry of this subspace, which we call the eigenstate moduli problem is
parameterized by a set of 2-particle Hamiltonian. This problem is closely
related to the $N$-representability conditions for 2-reduced density matrices,
a long-standing challenge for quantum many-body systems. Despite its
importance, the eigenstate moduli problem remains largely unexplored in the
literature. In this Letter, we propose a comprehensive approach to this

determine the eigenstate spaces of $m$-interaction systems as projective

reduced density matrices. We investigate the geometrical structure of these

detachment of detrital fines against electrostatic attraction and authigenic
fines by breakage, from the rock surface. While much is currently known about
the underlying mechanisms governing detachment of detrital particles, including
detachment criteria at the pore scale and its upscaling for the core scale, a
critical gap exists due to absence of this knowledge for authigenic fines.
Integrating 3D Timoshenkos beam theory of elastic cylinder deformation with
CFD-based model for viscous flow around the attached particle and with strength
failure criteria for particle-rock bond, we developed a novel theory for fines
detachment by breakage at the pore scale. The breakage criterium derived
includes analytical expressions for tensile and shear stress maxima along with
two geometric diagrams which allow determining the breaking stress. This leads
to an explicit formula for the breakage flow velocity. Its upscaling yields a
mathematical model for fines detachment by breakage, expressed in the form of
the maximum retained concentration of attached fines versus flow velocity --
maximum retention function (MRF) for breakage. We performed corefloods with
piecewise constant increasing flow rates, measuring breakthrough concentration
and pressure drop across the core. The behaviour of the measured data is
consistent with two-population colloidal transport, attributed to detrital and
authigenic fines migration. Indeed, the laboratory data show high match with
the analytical model for two-population colloidal transport, which validates
the proposed mathematical model for fines detachment by breakage.

This is only the second source which has two different periods. The period of
~1260 days is approximately twice as long as the longest known period of 6.7

the consistency with the expected period-luminosity relation suggest that the

paper, we systematically study the topological properties and intrinsic SHE of
layered transition metal carbides $M_{2}\rm{C}$ ($M=\rm{V}, \rm{Nb}, \rm{Ta}$).
The results show that both bulk and monolayer $M_{2}\rm{C}$ have
symmetry-protected nodal points (NPs) and lines (NLs) originating from the $d$
band crossing near the Fermi level ($E_F$). The inclusion of SOC breaks the
degeneracy of NLs and NPs, contributing to large spin Hall conductivity (SHC)
up to $\sim$1100 and $\sim$200 $(\hbar / e)(\Omega \mathrm{cm})^{-1}$ for bulk

SHC exhibits a significant enhancement by increasing the layer number. For
eight-layer Ta$_{2}$C, the maximum value of SHC can reach up to $\sim$600
$(\hbar / e)(\Omega \mathrm{cm})^{-1}$, comparable to many reported 3D
topological materials. Analysis of spin Berry curvature reveals that the large
SHC originates from layer-number-dependent nodal line structure near the $E_F$,
in which the repeated crossover between valence and conduction bands creates
large amounts of NPs along the $\Gamma\rm{-K}$ route. Our findings not only
provide a new platform for experimental research of low-dimensional SHE, but
also suggest an effective way of realizing giant SHE by controlling layer

best explained by a magnetic ground state of ferromagnetically coupled layers

transitions for fields applied along the $c$-axis corresponding to spin-flip

magnetization one-third of the saturated value. From our analysis of the

exchange between nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor layers, indicating
the influence of long-range interactions. Meanwhile we find little change of

Preoperative prediction of LN metastasis from non-invasive CT imaging is highly
desired, as it might be straightforwardly used to guide the following
neoadjuvant treatment decision and surgical planning. Most studies only capture
the tumor characteristics in CT imaging to implicitly infer LN metastasis and
very few work exploit direct LN's CT imaging information. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to propose a fully-automated LN segmentation
and identification network to directly facilitate the LN metastasis status
prediction task. Nevertheless LN segmentation/detection is very challenging
since LN can be easily confused with other hard negative anatomic structures
(e.g., vessels) from radiological images. We explore the anatomical spatial
context priors of pancreatic LN locations by generating a guiding attention map
from related organs and vessels to assist segmentation and infer LN status. As
such, LN segmentation is impelled to focus on regions that are anatomically
adjacent or plausible with respect to the specific organs and vessels. The
metastasized LN identification network is trained to classify the segmented LN
instances into positives or negatives by reusing the segmentation network as a
pre-trained backbone and padding a new classification head. More importantly,
we develop a LN metastasis status prediction network that combines the
patient-wise aggregation results of LN segmentation/identification and deep

function, with the forward-forward (FF) adaptation scheme. Furthermore, PFF
efficiently learns to propagate learning signals and updates synapses with
forward passes only, eliminating key structural and computational constraints
imposed by backpropagation-based schemes. Besides computational advantages, the
PFF process could prove useful for understanding the learning mechanisms behind
biological neurons that use local signals despite missing feedback connections.
We run experiments on image data and demonstrate that the PFF procedure works
as well as backpropagation, offering a promising brain-inspired algorithm for
classifying, reconstructing, and synthesizing data patterns.

  Applications",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rapid growth of handheld devices in the internet of things (IoT)
networks, mobile applications have become ubiquitous in everyday life. As
technology is developed, so do also the risks and threats associated with it,
especially in the forthcoming quantum era. Existing IoT networks, however, lack
a quantum-resistant secret key sharing scheme to meet confidential message
transmission demands in wide-area mobile applications. To address this issue,
this article proposes a new scheme, channel reciprocity (CR) based quantum key
distribution (QKD) CR-QKD, which accomplishes the goal of secret key sharing by
combining emerging techniques of QKD and CR-based key generation (CRKG).
Exploiting laws of quantum physics and properties of wireless channels, the
proposed scheme is able to ensure the secrecy of the key, even against
computationally unbounded adversaries. The basic mechanism is elaborated for a
single-user case and it is extended into a multi-user case by redesigning a
multi-user edge forwarding strategy. In addition, to make CR-QKD more
practical, some enhancement strategies are studied to reduce the time delay and
to improve the secret key generation rate in a secure manner. A prototype of
CR-QKD is demonstrated in a metropolitan area network, where secret keys are
shared between two remote IoT devices that are roughly fifteen kilometers apart
from each other. The experimental results have verified that CR-QKD allows a
secret key rate of 424 bits per second with a retransmission rate of 2.1%.

GraphSAGE layer operators and attention mechanism, achieving comparable

we propose a pruning approach including weight pruning and input pruning. While
weight pruning through lasso regression reduces most parameters without
accuracy drop, input pruning eliminates most input pixels with negligible
accuracy drop. \emph{Architecture design}: to fully unleash the computation
parallelism within the proposed model, we develop a novel unified hardware
architecture that can execute various computation kernels (feature aggregation,
feature transformation, graph pooling). The proposed hardware design adopts the
Scatter-Gather paradigm to efficiently handle the irregular computation
{patterns} of various computation kernels. We deploy the proposed design on an

supermassive black holes. The reason for the existence of these black holes
with such a huge mass is still unclear and various models have been proposed to
explain them. However, there is still no comprehensive explanation that is
accepted by the community. The only thing we are sure of is that these black
holes were not created by the collapse of giant stars, nor by the accretion of
matter around them. Moreover, another important question is the mass
distribution of these black holes over time. Observations have shown that if we
go back through redshift, we see black holes with more masses, and after
passing the peak of star formation redshift, this procedure decreases.
Nevertheless, the exact redshift of this peak is still controversial. In this
paper, with the help of deep learning and the LSTM algorithm, we tried to find
a suitable model for the mass of central black holes of quasars over time by
considering QuasarNET data. Our model was built with these data reported from
redshift 3 to 7 and for two redshift intervals 0 to 3 and 7 to 10, it predicted
the mass of the quasar's central supermassive black holes. We have also tested
our model for the specified intervals with observed data from central black
holes and discussed the results.

respectively, the reactive-type and dissipative-type unstable modes with
dominant Alfv\'enic polarization, thus the former being more precisely called
low-frequency Alfv\'en modes (LFAMs). More specifically, due to different
instability mechanisms, the maximal drive of BAEs occurs, in comparison to
LFAMs, when the minimum of the safety factor ($q_{min}$) deviates from a
rational number. Meanwhile, the BAE eigenfunction peaks at the radial position
of the maximum energetic particle pressure gradient, resulting in a large
deviation from the $q_{min}$ surface. Moreover, the ascending frequency
spectrum patterns of the experimentally observed BAEs and LFAMs can be
theoretically reproduced by varying $q_{min}$ and also be well interpreted

long-standing conundrum for solar system formation models as they can only be
created in the inner hot disk at temperatures higher than 800 K, and there is
no obvious mechanism to transport them out into the comets formation region.
Here we propose that these particles could have formed inside the hydrostatic
envelopes surrounding young protoplanets still embedded in the protoplanetary
disk. Using a simplified 1D model we investigate the thermal structure of these
envelopes, and find that for core masses ranging from 0.08 to 1.5 M_Earth,
located anywhere between 1 and 30 AU, the temperature and pressure at the base
of the envelopes are high enough to quickly vaporize silicate particles of
various sizes. Moreover, if the grain abundance is at least solar, these
envelopes become fully convective, allowing for dust ejection across the Bondi
radius back into the disk. Amorphous silicates are hence thermally processed
into crystalline particles in these envelopes, and then transported back to
disk through convective diffusion to be finally incorporated into the cometary
building blocks.

occurs from vertex $a$ to vertex $b$ if the $(b,a)$-entry of the unitary matrix
$\exp(-iHt)$ has unit magnitude for some time $t$. This phenomenon is relevant
for information transmission in quantum spin networks and is known to be
monogamous under real symmetric matrices. We prove the following results:
  1. For oriented graphs (whose nonzero weights are $\pm i$), the oriented
$3$-cycle and the oriented edge are the only graphs where perfect state
transfer occurs between every pair of vertices. This settles a conjecture of
Cameron et al. On the other hand, we construct an infinite family of oriented
graphs with perfect state transfer between any pair of vertices on a subset of
size four.
  2. There are infinite families of Hermitian graphs with one-way perfect state
transfer, where perfect state transfer occurs without periodicity. In contrast,
perfect state transfer implies periodicity whenever the adjacency matrix has
algebraic entries (as shown by Godsil).
  3. There are infinite families with non-monogamous pretty good state transfer
in rooted graph products. In particular, we generalize known results on double
stars (due to Fan and Godsil) and on paths with loops (due to Kempton, Lippner
and Yau). The latter extends the experimental observation of quantum transport
(made by Zimbor\'{a}s et al.) and shows non-monogamous pretty good state
transfer can occur amongst distant vertices.

a flexible model for such systems is constructed by approximating the

it does not use prohibitive assumptions on the underlying component lifetimes.
Due to its flexible nature, the model is capable of providing a good fit to
data obtained from load-sharing systems in general, thus resulting in an
accurate estimation of important reliability characteristics. Estimates of
reliability at a mission time, quantile function, mean time to failure, and
mean residual time for load-sharing systems are developed under the proposed

attracted growing interest in recent decades, fuelled by the mounting
popularity of online social networks (OSNs). On online social platforms, a few
individuals, commonly referred to as \textit{influencers}, produce the majority
of content consumed by users. However, classic opinion models do not capture
this communication asymmetry in OSNs. We develop an opinion model inspired by
observations on leading social media platforms and tailored to the
peculiarities of online interactions. Our work has two main objectives: first,
to describe the inherent communication asymmetry in OSNs, where a tiny group of
\textit{influencers} hegemonizes the landscape of social debate, and second, to
model the personalization of content by the social media platform. We derive a
Fokker-Planck equation for the temporal evolution of users' opinion
distribution and analytically characterize the stationary system behavior.
Analytical results, confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations, show how content
personalization tends to radicalize user opinion and favor structurally
advantaged influencers. These emerging behaviors suggest that algorithmic bias,
inherently associated with platform filtering, can lead to undesirable
outcomes. As an example application, we apply our model to Facebook during the
Italian government crisis in the summer of 2019. Our work provides a flexible
framework to assess the impact of algorithmic filtering on the opinion
formation process and a fine-grained tool to study the complex interaction

degradation assessment, two problems remain when these are applied to
underwater object tracking (UOT). A single-object tracker is trained on
open-air datasets, which results in a serious sample imbalance between
underwater objects and open-air objects when it is applied to UOT. Moreover,
underwater targets such as fish and dolphins usually have a similar appearance,
and it is challenging for models to discriminate weak discriminative features.
Existing detection-based post-processing approaches struggle to distinguish a
tracked target from similar objects. In this study, the UOSTrack is proposed,
which involves the use of underwater images and open-air sequence hybrid
training (UOHT), and motion-based post-processing (MBPP). The UOHT training
paradigm is designed to train the sample-imbalanced underwater tracker. In
particular, underwater object detection (UOD) images are converted into image
pairs through customised data augmentation, such that the tracker is exposed to
more underwater domain training samples and learns the feature expressions of
underwater objects. The MBPP paradigm is proposed to exclude similar objects
near the target. In particular, it employs the estimation box predicted using a
Kalman filter and the candidate boxes in each frame to reconfirm the tracked
target that is hidden in the candidate area when it has been lost. UOSTrack
provides an average performance improvement of 3.5 % compared to OSTrack on
similar object challenge attribute in UOT100 and UTB180. The average
performance improvements provided by UOSTrack are 1 % and 3 %, respectively.
The results from two UOT benchmarks demonstrate that UOSTrack sets a new
state-of-the-art benchmark, and the effectiveness of UOHT and MBPP, and the
generalisation and applicability of the MBPP for use in UOT.

settling through a three-layer stratified fluid in the absence of neutral
buoyant position, which was firstly discovered by Abaid, N., Adalsteinsson D.,
Agyapong A. & McLaughlin, R.M. (2004) in salinity-induced stratification. Both
experiments and numerical simulations are carried out. In our experiments,
illuminated by a laser sheet on the central plane of the particle, its bouncing
behaviour is well captured. We find that the bouncing process starts after the
wake detaches from the particle. The PIV results show that an upward jet is
generated at the central axis behind the particle after the wake breaks. By
conducting a force decomposition procedure, we quantify the enhanced drag
caused by the buoyancy of the wake ($F_{sb}$) and the flow structure
($F_{sj}$). It is noted that $F_{sb}$ contributes primarily to the enhanced
drag at the early stage, which becomes less dominant after the detachment of
the wake. In contrast, $F_{sj}$ plays a pivotal role in reversing the
particle's motion. We conjecture that the jet flow is a necessary condition for
the occurrence of bouncing motion. Then, we examine the minimal velocities
(negative values when bounce occurs) of the particle by varying the lower
Reynolds number $Re_l$, the Froude number $Fr$ and the upper Reynolds number
$Re_u$ within the ranges $1 \leq Re_l\leq 125$, $115 \leq Re_u\leq 356$ and $2
\leq Fr\leq 7$. We find that the bouncing behaviour is primarily determined by
$Re_l$. In our experiments, the bouncing motion is found to occur below a
critical lower Reynolds number around $Re^ \ast _{l}=30$. In the numerical
simulations, the highest value for this critical number is $Re^ \ast
_{l}=46.2$, limited in the currently studied parametric ranges.

inclination, a dark lane of the disk midplane, bipolar outflows, and streamer
features likely tracing infalling material from the surrounding birth cloud
onto the disk. The analysis of the light curve suggests the star is a binary

ALMA continuum and 12CO line emission shows the disk is in keplerian rotation,
with the northern side of the outflowing material receding, while the southern
side approaching the observer. The disk is itself seen edge-on. The direction
of the outflows seen in scattered light is in agreement with the direction of
the more distant molecular hydrogen emission-line objects (MHOs) associated to

to a change in the direction of the angular momentum of the material accreting

well-posed in the space $X = [H^1]^3 \times [H(\textrm{curl})]^3$.
Consequently, finite element formulations of the model rely on $H^1$-conforming
subspaces and N\'ed\'elec elements for discrete solutions of the corresponding
variational problem. This work applies the recently introduced polytopal
template methodology for the construction of N\'ed\'elec elements. This is done
in conjunction with Bernstein-B\'ezier polynomials and dual numbers in order to
compute hp-FEM solutions of the model. Bernstein-B\'ezier polynomials allow for
optimal complexity in the assembly procedure due to their natural factorization
into univariate Bernstein base functions. In this work, this characteristic is
further augmented by the use of dual numbers in order to compute their values
and their derivatives simultaneously. The application of the polytopal template
methodology for the construction of the N\'ed\'elec base functions allows them
to directly inherit the optimal complexity of the underlying Bernstein-B\'ezier
basis. We introduce the Bernstein-B\'ezier basis along with its factorization
to univariate Bernstein base functions, the principle of automatic
differentiation via dual numbers and a detailed construction of N\'ed\'elec
elements based on Bernstein-B\'ezier polynomials with the polytopal template
methodology. This is complemented with a corresponding technique to embed
Dirichlet boundary conditions, with emphasis on the consistent coupling
condition. The performance of the elements is shown in examples of the relaxed
micromorphic model.

yields exactly two intersymbol interference components from the preceding and
the subsequent data symbols, provided that the roll-off factor is $100\%$ and
the modulation packing factor is set to $50\%$. This can be exploited to
symmetrically multiplex two data streams of transmitted symbols. Hence, the
proposed scheme is referred to as pulse-shape binary multiplex modulation. The
demodulation of the two multiplexed data streams at the receiver can be aided
by making the streams mutually orthogonal. It can be achieved by superposition
modulation with symbol-by-symbol interference cancellation, proper design of
transmission sequences interleaving pilot and data symbols in order to also
enable channel estimation, and using orthogonal spreading sequences. The
presented numerical results indicate that the proposed modulation scheme can
outperform Nyquist signaling in terms of transmission reliability or the time
required for transmitting the whole sequence of data symbols. For instance,
differentially encoded modulation symbols can be transmitted twice as fast by
the proposed modulation scheme with a 3 dB penalty in signal-to-noise ratio
over additive white Gaussian noise channels.

local stability and bifurcations of the two models. To the best of our
knowledge, the complete stability conditions of the second model are obtained
for the first time. We also investigate periodic solutions as well as their

parameter space of the second model is much more complex than that of the first

of any periodic orbit with a fixed order constitutes a connected set. In the
second model, however, the stability regions for the 3-cycle, 4-cycle, and

bound not to individual member galaxies, but to the halo of galaxy clusters.
Leading theories predict that the ICL fraction, defined by the ratio of the ICL
to the total light, rapidly decreases with increasing redshift, to the level of
a few per cent at z > 1. However, observational studies have remained
inconclusive about the fraction beyond redshift unity because, to date, only
two clusters in this redshift regime have been investigated. One shows a much
lower fraction than the mean value at low redshift, whereas the other possesses
a fraction similar to the low-redshift value. Here we report an ICL study of
ten galaxy clusters at 1 \lesssim z \lesssim 2 based on deep infrared imaging
data. Contrary to the leading theories, our study finds that ICL is already
abundant at z \lesssim 1, with a mean ICL fraction of approximately 17\%.
Moreover, no significant correlation between cluster mass and ICL fraction or
between ICL color and cluster-centric radius is observed. Our findings suggest
that gradual stripping can no longer be the dominant mechanism of ICL
formation. Instead, our study supports the scenario wherein the dominant ICL
production occurs in tandem with the formation and growth of the brightest
cluster galaxies and/or through the accretion of preprocessed stray stars.

is thus tightly linked to our understanding of the explosion mechanism of
supernovae and supernova nucleosynthesis. X-ray and gamma-ray observations of
young supernova remnants, combined with improved theoretical modeling, have
resulted in enormous improvements in our knowledge of these events. The isotope
${}^{44}$Ti is one of the most sensitive probes of the innermost regions of the
core collapse engine, and its spatial and velocity distribution are key
observables. Hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy with the Nuclear Spectroscopic
Telescope Array (NuSTAR) has provided new insights into the structure of the
supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A), establishing the convective nature of
the supernova engine. However, many questions about the details of this engine
remain. We present here the concept for a balloon-borne follow-up mission

transition edge sensor gamma-ray microcalorimeter detectors with a demonstrated
55 eV Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) energy resolution at 97 keV. This
8--16-fold improvement in energy resolution over NuSTAR will allow high
resolution imaging and spectroscopy of the ${}^{44}$Ti emission. This will
allow a detailed reconstruction of gamma-ray line redshifts, widths, and
shapes, allowing us to address questions such as: What is the source of the
neutron star ""kicks""? What is the dominant production pathway for ${}^{44}$Ti?

must account for stochastic disturbances. Such disturbances are often modeled
as process noise in a dynamical system, and common assumptions are that the
underlying distributions are known and/or Gaussian. In practice, however, these
assumptions may be unrealistic and can lead to poor approximations of the true
noise distribution. We present a novel controller synthesis method that does
not rely on any explicit representation of the noise distributions. In
particular, we address the problem of computing a controller that provides
probabilistic guarantees on safely reaching a target, while also avoiding
unsafe regions of the state space. First, we abstract the continuous control
system into a finite-state model that captures noise by probabilistic
transitions between discrete states. As a key contribution, we adapt tools from
the scenario approach to compute probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds on
these transition probabilities, based on a finite number of samples of the
noise. We capture these bounds in the transition probability intervals of a
so-called interval Markov decision process (iMDP). This iMDP is, with a
user-specified confidence probability, robust against uncertainty in the
transition probabilities, and the tightness of the probability intervals can be
controlled through the number of samples. We use state-of-the-art verification
techniques to provide guarantees on the iMDP and compute a controller for which
these guarantees carry over to the original control system. In addition, we
develop a tailored computational scheme that reduces the complexity of the
synthesis of these guarantees on the iMDP. Benchmarks on realistic control
systems show the practical applicability of our method, even when the iMDP has
hundreds of millions of transitions.

view, the goal is usually to determine a pair of pricing and allocation of the
items that provides an efficient distribution of the resources, i.e., maximizes
the social welfare, or is as profitable as possible for the seller, i.e.,
maximizes the revenue. To overcome the weaknesses of mechanisms operating with
static prices, a recent line of research has concentrated on dynamic pricing
schemes. In this model, agents arrive in an unspecified sequential order, and
the prices can be updated between two agent-arrivals. Though the dynamic
setting is capable of maximizing social welfare in various scenarios, the
assumption that the agents arrive one after the other eliminates the standard
concept of fairness.
  In this paper, we study the existence of optimal dynamic prices under
fairness constraints in unit-demand markets. We propose four possible notions
of envy-freeness of different strength depending on the time period over which
agents compare themselves to others: the entire time horizon, only the past,
only the future, or only the present. For social welfare maximization, while
the first definition leads to Walrasian equilibria, we give polynomial-time
algorithms that always find envy-free optimal dynamic prices in the remaining
three cases. In contrast, for revenue maximization, we show that the
corresponding problems are APX-hard if the ordering of the agents is fixed. On
the positive side, we give polynomial-time algorithms for the setting when the
seller can choose the order in which agents arrive.

different general features for a wide set of H-bonded compounds. Our model

tunnel more efficiently than deuterons along the 1D chain, giving rise to a
strong attraction center that pulls the oxygens together. This mechanism, which

mechanisation of the data generation process across various domains. It is
challenging to estimate the average causal effect and individual causal effects

dimension and the problem of data sufficiency. The existing matching methods
can not effectively estimate individual causal effect or solve the problem of
dimension curse in causal inference. To address this challenge, in this work,
we prove that the reduced set by sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) is a
balance score for confounding adjustment. Under the theorem, we propose to use
an SDR method to obtain a reduced representation set of the original covariates
and then the reduced set is used for the matching method. In detail, a
non-parametric model is used to learn such a reduced set and to avoid model
specification errors. The experimental results on real-world datasets show that
the proposed method outperforms the compared matching methods. Moreover, we
conduct an experiment analysis and the results demonstrate that the reduced

invariant orders of binary forms, and these have been intensively studied. If
$\alpha ,\beta$ are two $\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$-equivalent algebraic numbers,
i.e., $\beta =(a\alpha +b)/(c\alpha +d)$ for some
$\big(\begin{smallmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{smallmatrix}\big)\in\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$,
then $\mathbb{Z}_{\alpha}=\mathbb{Z}_{\beta}$. Given an order $\mathcal{O}$ of
a number field, we call any $\text{GL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$-equivalence class of
$\alpha$ with $\mathbb{Z}_{\alpha}=\mathcal{O}$ a rational monogenization of
$\mathcal{O}$.
  We prove the following. If $K$ is a quartic number field, then $K$ has only
finitely many orders with more than two rational monogenizations. This is best
possible. Further, if $K$ is a number field of degree $\geq 5$, the Galois
group of whose normal closure is five times transitive, then $K$ has only
finitely many orders with more than one rational monogenization. The proof uses
finiteness results for unit equations, which in turn were derived from
Schmidt's Subspace Theorem.
  We generalize the above results to rationally monogenic orders over rings of
$S$-integers of number fields.

  of arXiv:2109.08760",,,,"math.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The problem of density of $C^0$-stable mappings is a classical and venerable
subject in singularity theory. In 1973, Mather showed that the set of proper
$C^0$-stable mappings is dense in the set of all proper mappings, which implies
that the set of $C^0$-stable mappings is dense in the set of all mappings if
the source manifold is compact. The aim of this paper is to complement Mather's
result and to provide new information to the subject. Namely, we show that the
set of $C^0$-stable mappings is never dense in the set of all mappings if the
source manifold is non-compact. As a corollary of this result and Mather's
result, we can obtain a characterization of density of $C^0$-stable mappings,
i.e., the set of $C^0$-stable mappings is dense in the set of all mappings if
and only if the source manifold is compact. To prove the non-density result, we
provide a more essential result by using the notion of topologically critical

with energy above $10^{17}$ to $10^{18}$ eV requires widely-spaced particle
detectors at the ground level to detect the extensive air showers induced in
the atmosphere. The air-shower sizes, proxies of the primary energies, are then
estimated by fitting the observed signals to a functional form for expectations
so as to interpolate the signal at a reference distance. The functional form
describes the rapid falloff of the expected signal with the distance from the
shower core, using typically two logarithmic slopes to account for the
short-range and long-range decreases of signals. The uncertainties associated
to the air-shower sizes are determined under the assumption of a quadratic
dependence of the log-likelihood on the fitted parameters around the minimum,
so that a meaningful variance-covariance matrix is provided. In this paper, we
show that for an event topology where one signal is much larger than the
others, the quadratic dependence of the fitted function around the minimum is a
poor approximation that leads to an inaccurate estimate of the uncertainties.
To restore a quadratic shape, we propose to use the polar coordinates around
the detector recording the largest signal, projected onto the plane of the
shower front, to define the likelihood function in terms of logarithmic polar
distances, polar angles and logarithmic shower sizes as free parameters. We
show that a meaningful variance-covariance matrix is then recovered in the new

uncertainties in the new coordinate system for subsequent high-level analyses
is illustrated.

however, many machine learning methods used for this prediction task do not

two recently developed explainable artificial intelligence techniques called
gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) and expected gradients
(EG) to reveal the decision-making process behind a high-performance neural
network that has been trained to distinguish between MgII spectra derived from
flaring and nonflaring active regions, a fact that can be applied to the task
of short timescale flare forecasting. The two techniques generate visual
explanations (heatmaps) that can be projected back onto the spectra, allowing
for the identification of features that are strongly associated with precursory
flare activity. We automated the search for explainable interpretations on the
level of individual wavelengths, and provide multiple examples of flare
prediction using IRIS spectral data, finding that prediction scores in general
increase before flare onset. Large IRIS rasters that cover a significant
portion of the active region and coincide with small preflare brightenings both
in IRIS and SDO/AIA images tend to lead to better forecasts. The models reveal
that MgII triplet emission, flows, as well as broad and highly asymmetric
spectra are all important for the task of flare prediction. Additionally, we
find that intensity is only weakly correlated to a spectrum's prediction score,
meaning that low intensity spectra can still be of great importance for the
flare prediction task, and that $78$% of the time, the position of the model's
maximum attention along the slit during the preflare phase is predictive of the
location of the flare's maximum UV emission

AOFlagger detection approach. We introduce several new features, including ways
to deal with ranges of invalid data (e.g. caused by shadowing) in both the
SumThreshold and scale-invariant rank operator steps; pre-calibration bandpass
calibration; auto-correlation flagging; and HI flagging avoidance. These
methods are implemented in a new framework that uses the Lua language for
scripting, which is new in AOFlagger version 3. Results. Our approach removes
RFI fully automatically, and is robust and effective enough for further
calibration and (continuum) imaging of these data. Analysis of 304 observations
show an average of 11.1% of lost data due to RFI with a large spread. We
observe 14.6% RFI in auto-correlations. Computationally, AOFlagger achieves a
throughput of 370 MB/s on a single computing node. Compared to published
machine learning results, the method is one to two orders of magnitude faster.

found that the two-component wavefunction for the 1D Feshbach-Villars equation

  piecewise-regular coefficients arising from multi-wave inverse problems",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-wave inverse problems are indirect imaging methods using the
interaction of two different imaging modalities. One brings spatial accuracy,
and the other contrast sensitivity. The inversion method typically involve two
steps. The first step is devoted to accessing internal datum of quantities
related to the unknown parameters being observed. The second step involves
recovering the parameters themselves from the internal data. To perform that
inversion, a typical requirement is that the Jacobian of fields involved does
not vanish. A number of authors have considered this problem in the past two
decades, and a variety of methods have been developed. Existing techniques
require H{\""o}lder continuity of the parameters to be reconstructed. In
practical applications, the medium may present embedded elements, with distinct
physical properties, leading to discontinuous coefficients. In this article we
explain how a Jacobian constraint can imposed in the piecewise regular case,
when the physical model is a divergence form second order linear elliptic
boundary value problem.

presented for adiabatic and isothermal (cooled) walls. Flow snapshots indicate
that the separation bubble contracts and expands in a similar fashion for both
thermal boundary conditions. However, the skin-friction coefficient
distributions reveal a downstream displacement of the separation region when
cooling is applied. The separation bubble is also smaller for this setup
compared to the adiabatic one. A steeper pressure rise is observed for the
isothermal wall downstream of the incident oblique shock, and this occurs
because the incident shock wave gets closer to the blade surface when cooling
is applied. The Reynolds stresses are computed to investigate the effects of
wall temperature on the turbulence activity. While the levels of the tangential

noisy labelings while inter-disagreement among experts is often a good
indicator for the ambiguity and uncertainty that is inherent in natural
language. In this paper, we propose a framework called Learning Ambiguity from
Crowd Sequential Annotations (LA-SCA) to explore the inter-disagreement between
reliable annotators and effectively preserve confusing label information.
First, a hierarchical Bayesian model is developed to infer ground-truth from
crowds and group the annotators with similar reliability together. By modeling
the relationship between the size of group the annotator involved in, the
annotator's reliability and element's unambiguity in each sequence,
inter-disagreement between reliable annotators on ambiguous elements is
computed to obtain label confusing information that is incorporated to
cost-sensitive sequence labeling. Experimental results on POS tagging and NER
tasks show that our proposed framework achieves competitive performance in
inferring ground-truth from crowds and predicting unknown sequences, and
interpreting hierarchical clustering results helps discover labeling patterns
of annotators with similar reliability.

shown that the decay of the positional probability density function P (X, t),

We show that such universality ceases to exist once the threshold of
exponential distribution of particle hops is crossed. While the mean hop is not
diverging and can attain a finite value; the transition itself is critical. The
exponential universality of rare events arises due to the contribution of all
the different states occupied during the process. Once the reported threshold
is crossed, a single large event determines the statistics. In this realm, the
big jump principle replaces the large deviation principle, and the spatial part
of the decay is unaffected by the temporal properties of rare events.

vector-valued capsules. They are motivated by the pattern recognition system in
the human brain, where complex objects are decomposed into a hierarchy of
simpler object parts. Such a hierarchy is referred to as a parse-tree.
Conceptually, capsule neural networks have been defined to realize such
parse-trees. The capsule neural network (CapsNet), by Sabour, Frosst, and
Hinton, is the first actual implementation of the conceptual idea of capsule
neural networks. CapsNets achieved state-of-the-art performance on simple image
recognition tasks with fewer parameters and greater robustness to affine
transformations than comparable approaches. This sparked extensive follow-up
research. However, despite major efforts, no work was able to scale the CapsNet
architecture to more reasonable-sized datasets. Here, we provide a reason for
this failure and argue that it is most likely not possible to scale CapsNets
beyond toy examples. In particular, we show that the concept of a parse-tree,
the main idea behind capsule neuronal networks, is not present in CapsNets. We
also show theoretically and experimentally that CapsNets suffer from a
vanishing gradient problem that results in the starvation of many capsules
during training.

  deep-subwavelength resolution","34 pages, 22 figures",,,,"physics.atm-clus","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Long-range coherence and correlations between electrons in solids are the
cornerstones for developing future quantum materials and devices. In 1954,
Dicke described correlated spontaneous emission from closely packed quantum
emitters, forming the theoretical basis of superradiance and superfluorescence.
Since then, it has remained an open challenge to observe such phenomena with
nanometer spatial resolution, precisely the important scale at which the
collective correlations occur. Here, we report the first instance of
free-electron-driven superfluorescence - superfluorescent cathodoluminescence -
enabling us to excite and observe correlations at nanometer spatial scales. To
exemplify this concept in our experiments, superlattices of lead halide
perovskite quantum dots are excited by focused pulses of multiple free
electrons. The electrons trigger superfluorescence: collective ultrafast
emission observed at rates faster than both the lifetime and decoherence time.
By controlling the area illuminated by the electron beam, we create a
transition from a non-correlated spontaneous emission to a correlated
superfluorescent emission. The observed signatures of superfluorescence are a
reduction of the intrinsic emitter lifetime, a narrower linewidth, and a
distinct redshift. We develop the theory of superfluorescent
cathodoluminescence, which matches the results and highlights the unique
features of electron-driven versus light-driven superfluorescence. Our
observation and theory introduce a novel way to characterize coherence and
correlations in quantum materials with nanometer spatial resolution, a key for
future engineering of quantum devices.

compression filter robust to the attenuation. This chirp approach was compared
to a standard ultrafast emission and a Hadamard-coded emission using a flow
phantom. The mismatched filter was also compared to a matched filter. Results
show that, for a velocity of a few mm/s, the mismatched filter gives a 4.4 to
10.4 dB increase of the signal-to-noise ratio compared to the Hadamard emission
and a 3.1 to 6.6 dB increase compared to the matched filter. Such increases are
obtained for a loss of axial resolution of 13% when comparing the point spread
functions of the mismatched and matched filters. Hence, the mismatched filter
allows increasing significantly the probe capacity to detect slow flows at the
cost of a small loss in axial resolution. This preliminary study is the first

intrinsic synergy between text detection and recognition. Previous methods
commonly regard manual annotations such as horizontal rectangles, rotated

expensive than using single-point. For the first time, we demonstrate that
training scene text spotting models can be achieved with an extremely low-cost
single-point annotation by the proposed framework, termed SPTS v2. SPTS v2
reserves the advantage of the auto-regressive Transformer with an Instance
Assignment Decoder (IAD) through sequentially predicting the center points of
all text instances inside the same predicting sequence, while with a Parallel
Recognition Decoder (PRD) for text recognition in parallel. These two decoders
share the same parameters and are interactively connected with a simple but
effective information transmission process to pass the gradient and
information. Comprehensive experiments on various existing benchmark datasets
demonstrate the SPTS v2 can outperform previous state-of-the-art single-point
text spotters with fewer parameters while achieving 19$\times$ faster inference
speed. Most importantly, within the scope of our SPTS v2, extensive experiments
further reveal an important phenomenon that single-point serves as the optimal
setting for the scene text spotting compared to non-point, rectangular bounding
box, and polygonal bounding box. Such an attempt provides a significant
opportunity for scene text spotting applications beyond the realms of existing
paradigms. Code will be available at https://github.com/bytedance/SPTSv2.

the relative importance of different temperature-corrected decay channels in
the gradual process of reheating depending on the reheating equation of state

universal gravitational decay of inflaton is observed to play a very crucial
role in the reheating process for a large range of inflaton decay parameters.
For our study, we consider typical $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models. We
further establish the intriguing connection among those different inflaton

enrichment of silicates of the interstellar medium of galaxies. We consider a
sub-sample of AGB stars, whose SED is characterised by deep absorption features
at $10$ and $18\mu$m, which can be regarded as the class of stars providing the
most relevant contribution to the silicates' production across the Universe.
Results from stellar evolution and dust formation modelling were used to fit
the observed SED and to reproduce, at the same time, the detected pulsation
periods and the derived surface chemical composition. This analysis leads to
the derivation of tight constraints on the silicates' production rates
experienced by these sources during the final AGB stages. Two out of the four
sources investigated are interpreted as stars currently undergoing HBB,
evolving through phases close to the stage when the mass-loss rate is largest.
The remaining two stars are likely evolving through the very final AGB phases,
after HBB was turned off by the gradual consumption of the convective mantle.
Mass-loss rates of the order of $1-2\times 10^{-4} M_{\odot}/$yr are required

increase by 4-5.5 orders of magnitude during solar flares, responding most
strongly to the non-thermal electron flux of the beam. Generally, $b_1$
decreased from $10^2$-$10^3$ to closer to unity during solar flares, indicating
a stronger coupling to local conditions, while $T_c$ increased from $8$-$9$kK

dynamics of the constituting particles. A study of the dynamical response also
provides invaluable information on the character of those interactions. Here we
demonstrate how tuning the electrostatic interactions by an ionic surfactant in
dispersions of magnetic nanoplatelets leads to developing new dynamic modes in
magnetic response spectra. The collective modes can be induced or suppressed by
either varying the concentration ratio of the magnetic nanoplatelets (MP) to
the surfactant or increasing the MP concentration reflecting the nanoscale
characteristics of this fluid magnet.

a simultaneous inference framework, we aim to: identify as many of the signs of

of positive (or negative) parameters on subsets of interest. Our suggestion is
as follows: start by using the data to select the direction of the hypothesis
test for each parameter; then, adjust the one-sided $p$-values for the
selection, and use them for simultaneous inference on the selected $n$
one-sided hypotheses. The adjustment is straightforward assuming that the
one-sided $p$-values are conditionally valid and mutually independent. Such
assumptions are commonly satisfied in a meta-analysis, and we can apply our
approach following a test of the global null hypothesis that all parameters are
zero, or of the hypothesis of no qualitative interaction. We consider the use
of two multiple testing principles: closed testing and partitioning. The novel
procedure based on partitioning is more powerful, but slightly less
informative: it only infers on positive and non-positive signs. The procedure
takes at most a polynomial time, and we show its usefulness on a subgroup
analysis of a medical intervention, and on a meta-analysis of an educational

the image boundary, which potentially changes related geometric distributions

constructing a win-win representation on both content and boundary by
contributing a new learning model, i.e., Rectangling Rectification Network

By learning the control points on the rectified image, our model can flexibly
warp the source structure to the target domain and achieves an end-to-end
unsupervised deformation. To relieve the complexity of structure approximation,
we then inspire our RecRecNet to learn the gradual deformation rules with a DoF
(Degree of Freedom)-based curriculum learning. By increasing the DoF in each
curriculum stage, namely, from similarity transformation (4-DoF) to homography
transformation (8-DoF), the network is capable of investigating more detailed
deformations, offering fast convergence on the final rectangling task.
Experiments show the superiority of our solution over the compared methods on
both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The code and dataset will be

can impede the flow by stacking up in front of obstacles. We study shear-flow
along an array of narrow gas-filled grooves of finite length embedded in an
otherwise planar surface, with the gas-liquid interface protruding slightly
above or below the plane. Assuming immiscible surfactants forming an
incompressible, inviscid surfactant phase at the gas-liquid interfaces we
employ a recently proposed model [Baier and Hardt, J.Fluid Mech., 949 (2022)]
for addressing this situation. Using a domain perturbation technique together
with the Lorentz reciprocal theorem we obtain the slip length characterizing
the flow over such surfaces to second order in the maximal interface deflection
as a small parameter. We find that within the range of moderate interface
deflections studied, the slip length for flow over such surfaces is negative

contrary to expectations of reduced drag in flow over superhydrophobic surfaces
in Cassie state, surfactant covered interfaces can even be detrimental for drag
reduction in the limit where surfactants act as an effectively incompressible
surface-fluid. This has important implications for the appropriate design of
superhydrophobic surfaces for reducing flow resistance.

this paper, we perform a comprehensive pathway-based analysis of gene
expression profiles in response to low-dose radiation exposure, in order to
examine the potential mechanism of gene regulation underlying such responses.
To accomplish this goal, we employ a statistical framework to determine whether
a specific group of genes belonging to a known pathway display coordinated

properties measured by a set of variables, plays an important role in many
statistical methods. For example, classification, clustering, and data
visualization methods all require a quantification of differences in the
observed values. We can refer to the quantification of such differences, as
distance. An appropriate definition of a distance depends on the nature of the
data and the problem at hand. For distances between numerical variables, there
exist many definitions that depend on the size of the observed differences. For
categorical data, the definition of a distance is more complex, as there is no
straightforward quantification of the size of the observed differences.
Consequently, many proposals exist that can be used to measure differences
based on categorical variables. In this paper, we introduce a general framework
that allows for an efficient and transparent implementation of distances
between observations on categorical variables. We show that several existing
distances can be incorporated into the framework. Moreover, our framework quite
naturally leads to the introduction of new distance formulations and allows for
the implementation of flexible, case and data specific distance definitions.
Furthermore, in a supervised classification setting, the framework can be used
to construct distances that incorporate the association between the response
and predictor variables and hence improve the performance of distance-based
classifiers.

challenged public health authorities worldwide. In the last decades, the
interaction of multiple factors, such as environmental and climate variability,
has influenced increments in incidence and geographical spread of the virus. In
Costa Rica, a country characterized by multiple microclimates separated by
short distances, dengue has been endemic since its introduction in 1993.
Understanding the role of climatic and environmental factors in the seasonal
and inter-annual variability of disease spread is essential to develop
effective surveillance and control efforts. In this study, we conducted a
wavelet time series analysis of weekly climate, local environmental variables,
and dengue cases (2001-2019) from 32 cantons in Costa Rica to identify
significant periods (e.g., annual, biannual) in which climate and environmental
variables co-varied with dengue cases. Wavelet coherence analysis was used to
characterize seasonality, multi-year outbreaks, and relative delays between the
time series. Results show that dengue outbreaks occurring every 3 years in
cantons located in the country's Central, North, and South Pacific regions were
highly coherent with the Oceanic Ni\~no 3.4 and the Tropical North Caribbean
Index (TNA). Dengue cases were in phase with El Ni\~no 3.4 and TNA, with El
Ni\~no 3.4 ahead of dengue cases by roughly nine months and TNA ahead by less
than three months. Annual dengue outbreaks were coherent with local
environmental variables (NDWI, EVI, Evapotranspiration, and Precipitation) in
most cantons except those located in the Central, South Pacific, and South
Caribbean regions of the country. The local environmental variables were in
phase with dengue cases and were ahead by around three months.

measure customer satisfaction and better manage their reputations. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic Brand-Topic Model (dBTM) which is able to
automatically detect and track brand-associated sentiment scores and
polarity-bearing topics from product reviews organised in temporally-ordered
time intervals. dBTM models the evolution of the latent brand polarity scores
and the topic-word distributions over time by Gaussian state space models. It
also incorporates a meta learning strategy to control the update of the
topic-word distribution in each time interval in order to ensure smooth topic
transitions and better brand score predictions. It has been evaluated on a
dataset constructed from MakeupAlley reviews and a hotel review dataset.
Experimental results show that dBTM outperforms a number of competitive
baselines in brand ranking, achieving a good balance of topic coherence and
uniqueness, and extracting well-separated polarity-bearing topics across time
intervals.

improvement of 169.2% noise-reduction in recorded EMG signal using developed
digital filter compared to analog one according to numerical root mean square
error (RMSE). Moreover, digital IIR was tested in two stages: algorithmic and
real-world. As a result, IIR's algorithmic (MATLAB) and real-world RMSEs were
0.03616 and 0.05224, respectively. A notable advancement of 20.8% in data

applicable to pathology AI research were identified. Guidelines were divided
into key categories, reflecting current study types and target areas for AI
research: Literature & Research Priorities, Discovery, Clinical Trial,

prospective and ergonomics studies that consider the complexity and reality of

developers and deploying organisations need to form collaborative partnerships.
This entails access to healthcare data, which frequently might also include
potentially identifiable data such as audio recordings of calls made to an
ambulance service call centre. Information Governance (IG) processes have been
put in place to govern the use of personal confidential data. However,
navigating IG processes in the formative stages of AI development and
pre-deployment can be challenging, because the legal basis for data sharing is
explicit only for the purpose of delivering patient care, i.e., once a system
is put into service. In this paper we describe our experiences of managing IG
for the assurance of healthcare AI, using the example of an
out-of-hospital-cardiac-arrest recognition software within the context of the
Welsh Ambulance Service. We frame IG as a socio-technical process. IG processes
for the development of trustworthy healthcare AI rely on information governance
work, which entails dialogue, negotiation, and trade-offs around the legal
basis for data sharing, data requirements and data control. Information
governance work should start early in the design life cycle and will likely
continue throughout. This includes a focus on establishing and building

it allows us to discover new randomization methods. We present various

their photometric variability and mass loss are still poorly constrained. The
atmospheres of evolved stars are characterized by complex dynamics due to
different interacting processes, such as convection, pulsation, formation of
molecules and dust, and the development of mass loss. These dynamical processes
impact the formation of spectral lines producing their asymmetries and Doppler
shifts. Thus, by studying the line-profile variations on spatial and temporal
scales it is possible to reconstruct atmospheric motions in stars and link them
to the photometric variability and mass loss. The tomographic method, which is
based on the cross-sectioning through the stellar atmosphere and recovering the

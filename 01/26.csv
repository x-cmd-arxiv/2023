and GeCo methods, which belong to the class of nonstandard schemes and preserve
the positivity as well as all linear invariants of the underlying system of
ordinary differential equations for any step size. A stability investigation
for these methods, which are outside the class of general linear methods, is
challenging since the iterates are always generated by a nonlinear map even for
linear problems. Recently, a stability theorem was derived presenting criteria
for understanding such schemes.
  For the analysis, the schemes are applied to general linear equations and
proven to be generated by $\mathcal C^1$-maps with locally Lipschitz continuous
first derivatives. As a result, the above mentioned stability theorem can be
applied to investigate the Lyapunov stability of non-hyperbolic fixed points of
the numerical method by analyzing the spectrum of the corresponding Jacobian of
the generating map. In addition, if a fixed point is proven to be stable, the
theorem guarantees the local convergence of the iterates towards it.
  In the case of first and second order gBBKS schemes the stability domain
coincides with that of the underlying Runge--Kutta method. Furthermore, while
the first order GeCo scheme converts steady states to stable fixed points for
all step sizes and all linear test problems of finite size, the second order
GeCo scheme has a bounded stability region for the considered test problems.
Finally, all theoretical predictions from the stability analysis are validated
numerically.

With the rapid evolution of computer science, data-driven techniques, in

load forecasting problem. These models have showed accurate forecasting
results; however, they need abundance amount of historical data to maintain the
performance. Considering the new buildings and buildings with low resolution

leading to poor forecasting performance. In order to adapt Deep Learning models
for buildings with limited and scarce data, this paper proposes a
Building-to-Building Transfer Learning framework to overcome the problem and
enhance the performance of Deep Learning models. The transfer learning approach
was applied to a new technique known as Transformer model due to its efficacy
in capturing data trends. The performance of the algorithm was tested on a
large commercial building with limited data. The result showed that the
proposed approach improved the forecasting accuracy by 56.8% compared to the
case of conventional deep learning where training from scratch is used. The
paper also compared the proposed Transformer model to other sequential deep

how to achieve fairness in recommendation has become an important problem.
Previous works on fairness-aware recommendation mainly focus on a predefined
set of (usually warm-start) users. However, recommender systems often face more
challenging fairness issues for new users or cold-start users due to their
insufficient amount of interactions. Therefore, it is essential to study
whether the trained model still performs fairly for a new set of cold-start
users. This paper considers the scenario where the recommender system meets new
users who only have limited or even no interaction with the platform, and aims
at providing high-quality and fair recommendations to such users effectively.
The sufficient interaction data from warm users is treated as the source user
domain, while the data from new users is treated as the target user domain, and
we consider to transfer the counterfactual fairness from the source users to
the target users. To this end, we introduce a framework to achieve transferable
counterfactual fairness in recommendation. The proposed method is able to
transfer the knowledge of a fair model learned from the source users to the
target users with the hope of improving the recommendation performance and
keeping the fairness property on the target users. Experiments on two
real-world datasets with representative recommendation algorithms show that our
method not only promotes fairness for the target users, but also outperforms
comparative models in terms of recommendation performance.

affect the dissipation of strong collisionless shocks formed after the shock

allows us to solve these two tasks together. For the ISM trees, this article
presents novel algorithms for recognizing scenes and predicting the poses of
searched objects. We define scenes as sets of objects, where some objects are
connected by 3-D spatial relations. In previous work, we recognized scenes
using single ISMs. However, these ISMs were prone to false positives. To
address this problem, we introduced ISM trees, a hierarchical model that
includes multiple ISMs. Through the recognition algorithm it contributes, this
article ultimately enables the use of ISM trees in scene recognition. We intend
to enable users to generate ISM trees from object arrangements demonstrated by
humans. The lack of a suitable algorithm is overcome by the introduction of an
ISM tree generation algorithm. In scene recognition, it is usually assumed that
image data is already available. However, this is not always the case for
robots. For this reason, we combined scene recognition and object search in
previous work. However, we did not provide an efficient algorithm to link the
two tasks. This article introduces such an algorithm that predicts the poses of
searched objects with relations. Experiments show that our overall approach

connected through a network topology interact locally to form their opinions
(beliefs) as regards certain hypotheses of interest. These opinions evolve over
time, since the agents collect observations from the environment, and update
their current beliefs by accounting for: their past beliefs, the innovation
contained in the new data, and the beliefs received from the neighbors. The
distinguishing feature of the present work is that agents are constrained to
share opinions regarding only a single hypothesis. We devise a novel learning
strategy where each agent forms a valid belief by completing the partial
beliefs received from its neighbors. This completion is performed by exploiting
the knowledge accumulated in the past beliefs, thanks to a principled
memory-aware rule inspired by a Bayesian criterion. The analysis allows us to
characterize the role of memory in social learning under partial information
sharing, revealing novel and nontrivial learning dynamics. Surprisingly, we
establish that the standard classification rule based on selecting the maximum
belief is not optimal under partial information sharing, while there exists a
consistent threshold-based decision rule that allows each agent to classify
correctly the hypothesis of interest. We also show that the proposed strategy
outperforms previously considered schemes, highlighting that the introduction
of memory in the social learning algorithm is critical to overcome the
limitations arising from sharing partial information.

arguably a key parameter, no systematic and satisfactory guiding principles
exist to select the number of units required for a given task and environment.
Even when limited by practical considerations, system designers should endeavor
to identify what a reasonable swarm size should be. Here, we show that this
fundamental question is closely linked to that of selecting an appropriate
swarm density. Our analysis of the influence of density on the collective
performance of a target tracking task reveals different `phases' corresponding
to markedly distinct group dynamics. We identify a `transition' phase, in which
a complex emergent collective response arises. Interestingly, the collective
dynamics within this transition phase exhibit a clear trade-off between
exploratory actions and exploitative ones. We show that at any density, the
exploration-exploitation balance can be adjusted to maximize the system's
performance through various means, such as by changing the level of
connectivity between agents. While the density is the primary factor to be
considered, it should not be the sole one to be accounted for when sizing the
system. Due to the inherent finite-size effects present in physical systems, we
establish that the number of constituents primarily affects system-level
properties such as exploitation in the transition phase. These results
illustrate that instead of learning and optimizing a swarm's behavior for a
specific set of task parameters, further work should instead concentrate on
learning to be adaptive, thereby endowing the swarm with the highly desirable
feature of being able to operate effectively over a wide range of
circumstances.

computing. Previous works have demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of
current-driven skyrmions in cascaded logic structures inspired by reversible
computing. As skyrmions can be propelled through the voltage-controlled
magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect with much greater efficiency, this work
proposes a VCMA-based skyrmion propagation mechanism that drastically reduces
energy dissipation. Additionally, we demonstrate the functionality of skyrmion
logic gates enabled by our novel voltage-based propagation and estimate its
energy efficiency relative to other logic schemes. The minimum dissipation of
this VCMA-driven magnetic skyrmion logic at 0 K is found to be $\sim$6$\times$
the room-temperature Landauer limit, indicating the potential for sub-Landauer
dissipation through further engineering.

with robots following automatically generated motion plans to service
application-level tasks. Given the safety requirements associated with
operating in proximity to humans and expensive infrastructure, it is important
to understand and mitigate the security vulnerabilities of such systems caused
by compromised robots who diverge from their assigned plans. We focus on
centralized systems, where a *central entity* (CE) is responsible for
determining and transmitting the motion plans to the robots, which report their
location as they move following the plan. The CE checks that robots follow
their assigned plans by comparing their expected location to the location they
self-report. We show that this self-reporting monitoring mechanism is
vulnerable to *plan-deviation attacks* where compromised robots don't follow
their assigned plans while trying to conceal their movement by mis-reporting
their location. We propose a two-pronged mitigation for plan-deviation attacks:
(1) an attack detection technique leveraging both the robots' local sensing
capabilities to report observations of other robots and *co-observation
schedules* generated by the CE, and (2) a prevention technique where the CE
issues *horizon-limiting announcements* to the robots, reducing their
instantaneous knowledge of forward lookahead steps in the global motion plan.
On a large-scale automated warehouse benchmark, we show that our solution
enables attack prevention guarantees from a stealthy attacker that has
compromised multiple robots.

detection in a two-dimensional environment, where both the object's impedance
and the properties of the detection signal may vary during operation. The
detection signal is assumed to be an acoustic beam created by an array of
emitters, which scans the area at different angles and different frequencies.
We propose an active control-based solution that creates an effective moving
dead zone around the object, and results in an artificial quiet channel for the
object to pass through undetected. The control principle is based on mid-domain
generation of near uni-directional beams using only monopole actuators. Based
on real-time response prediction, these beams open and close the dead zone with
a minimal perturbation backwards, which is crucial due to detector observers
being located on both sides of the object's route. The back action wave
determines the cloak efficiency, and is traded-off with the control effort; the
higher is the effort the quieter is the cloaking channel. We validate our
control algorithm via numerical experiments in a two-dimensional acoustic
waveguide, testing variation in frequency and incidence angle of the detection
source. Our cloak successfully intercepts the source by steering the control
beams and adjusting their wavelength accordingly.

these emitters, 16 lie in the MIRI coverage area and 12 exhibit a clear flux
excess at $5.6 \, \rm \mu m$, indicating the simultaneous presence of a
prominent H$\alpha$ emission line with EW$_{0}$(H$\alpha$) $\simeq 200-3000$
{\AA}. This is the first time that H$\alpha$ emission can be detected in
individual galaxies at $z>7$. The H$\alpha$ line, when present, allows us to
separate the contributions of H$\beta$ and [OIII] to the (H$\beta$ +[OIII])
complex, and derive H$\alpha$-based star formation rates (SFRs). We find that
in most cases [OIII]/H$\beta > 1$. Instead, two galaxies have [OIII]/H$\beta <
1$, indicating that the NIRCam flux excess is mainly driven by H$\beta$. This
could potentially imply extremely low metallicities. Most prominent line
emitters are very young starbursts or galaxies on their way to/from the
starburst cloud. They make for a cosmic SFR density $\rm
log_{10}(\rho_{SFR_{H\alpha}}) \simeq -2.35$, which is about a quarter of the
total value ($\rm log_{10}(\rho_{SFR_{tot}}) \simeq -1.76$) at $z\simeq 7-8$.
Therefore, the strong H$\alpha$ emitters likely had a significant role in
reionization.

broken-symmetry phases. Through a variational approach we derive the
single-particle energy shift in the mean-field equations which generates the
appropriate self-consistent field responsible for the stabilization of the
broken symmetry. With this correction the different flavours of the slave-spin
mean-field are actually the same method and they give identical results to
Kotliar-Ruckenstein slave-bosons and to the Gutzwiller approximation. We apply
our formalism to the N\'eel antiferromagnetic state and study it in
multi-orbital models as a function of the number of orbitals and Hund's
coupling strength, providing phase diagrams in the interaction-doping plane. We
show that the doped antiferromagnet in proximity of half-filling is typically
unstable towards insulator-metal and magnetic-non magnetic phase separation.
Hund's coupling extends the range of this antiferromagnet, and favors its phase
separation.

candidates were proposed, Kepler-1625 b-I and Kepler-1708 b-I. While the latter
still lacks a dynamical analysis of its stability, Kepler-1625 b-I has already
been the subject of several studies regarding its stability and origin.
Moreover, previous works have shown that this satellite system could harbour at
least two stable massive moons. Motivated by these results, we explored the
stability of co-orbital exomoons using the candidates Kepler-1625 b-I and
Kepler-1708 b-I as case studies. To do so, we performed numerical simulations
of systems composed of the star, planet, and the co-orbital pair formed by the
proposed candidates and another massive body. For the additional satellite, we
varied its mass and size from a Mars-like to the case where both satellites
have the same physical characteristics. We investigated the co-orbital region
around the Lagrangian equilibrium point $L_4$ of the system, setting the
orbital separation between the satellites from $\theta_{min} = 30^{\circ}$ to
$\theta_{max} = 90^{\circ}$. Our results show that stability islands are
possible in the co-orbital region of Kepler-1708 b-I as a function of the
co-orbital companion's mass and angular separation. Also, we identified that
resonances of librational frequencies, especially the 2:1 resonance, can
constrain the mass of the co-orbital companion. On the other hand, we found
that the proximity between the host planet and the star makes the co-orbital
region around Kepler-1625 b-I unstable for a massive companion. Finally, we
provide TTV profiles for a planet orbited by co-orbital exomoons.

for a special choice of the matrix eigenvalue parameters we found the so-called

with constraints. Specifically FQAOA tackle the constrains issue by using
fermion particle number preservation to intrinsically impose them throughout
QAOA. We provide a systematic guideline for designing the driver Hamiltonian
for a given problem Hamiltonian with constraints. The initial state can be
chosen to be a superposition of states satisfying the constraint and the ground
state of the driver Hamiltonian. This property is important since FQAOA reduced
to quantum adiabatic computation in the large limit of circuit depth p and
improved performance, even for shallow circuits with optimizing the parameters
starting from the fixed-angle determined by Trotterized quantum adiabatic
evolution. We perform an extensive numerical simulation and demonstrates that
proposed FQAOA provides substantial performance advantage against existing
approaches in portfolio optimization problems. Furthermore, the Hamiltonian
design guideline is useful not only for QAOA, but also Grover adaptive search
and quantum phase estimation to solve combinatorial optimization problems with
constraints. Since software tools for fermionic systems have been developed in
quantum computational chemistry both for noisy intermediate-scale quantum
computers and fault-tolerant quantum computers, FQAOA allows us to apply these
tools for constrained combinatorial optimization problems.

an inflaton and dark matter as in the ALP miracle scenario. Interestingly, in
the viable parameter region the strong CP phase must be suppressed, providing
another solution to the strong CP problem. This scenario is intimately linked

lensing, thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects (tSZ and kSZ), and

interest at these frequencies that should be present in the CMB maps:
extragalactic CO molecular rotational line emissions, which are the most widely
used tracers of molecular gas in the line intensity mapping experiments. Using
the SIDES simulations adopted for top hat bandpasses at 150 and 220 GHz, we
show that the cross-correlation of the CIB with CO lines has a contribution
similar to the CIB-tSZ correlation and the kSZ power, thereby contributing a
non-negligible amount to the total power at these scales. This signal,
therefore, may significantly impact the recently reported $\geq 3\sigma$
detection of the kSZ power spectrum from the South Pole Telescope (SPT)

time, a parameter which no physical clock can ever perfectly characterise. In
this letter, we study how limitations on acquiring knowledge of time impact
controlled quantum operations in different paradigms. We show that the quality
of timekeeping an agent has access to limits the gate complexity they are able
to achieve within circuit-based quantum computation. It also exponentially
impacts state preparation for measurement-based quantum computation. Another
area where quantum control is relevant is quantum thermodynamics. In that
context, we show that cooling a qubit can be achieved using a timer of
arbitrary quality for control: timekeeping error only impacts the rate of
cooling and not the achievable temperature. Our analysis combines techniques
from the study of autonomous quantum clocks and the theory of quantum channels
to understand the effect of imperfect timekeeping on controlled quantum
dynamics.

relationship between biological macromolecules' primary sequence and tertiary

thoroughly explored structure-to-sequence dependencies in proteins, RNA design
still confronts difficulties due to structural complexity and data scarcity.
Adding to the problem, direct transplantation of protein design methodologies
into RNA design fails to achieve satisfactory outcomes although sharing similar
structural components. In this study, we aim to systematically construct a
data-driven RNA design pipeline. We crafted a large, well-curated benchmark
dataset and designed a comprehensive structural modeling approach to represent
the complex RNA tertiary structure. More importantly, we proposed a
hierarchical data-efficient representation learning framework that learns
structural representations through contrastive learning at both cluster-level
and sample-level to fully leverage the limited data. By constraining data
representations within a limited hyperspherical space, the intrinsic
relationships between data points could be explicitly imposed. Moreover, we
incorporated extracted secondary structures with base pairs as prior knowledge
to facilitate the RNA design process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method, providing a reliable baseline for future
RNA design tasks. The source code and benchmark dataset will be released

coupled metals and non-Fermi liquids, it is valuable to have a framework to
understand properties of metals that are universal, in the sense that they must
hold in any metal. It has previously been argued that an infinite-dimensional
emergent symmetry group is such a property, at least for clean, compressible
metals. In this paper, we will show that such an emergent symmetry group has
very strong implications for the dynamics of the metal. Specifically, we show
that consideration of the hydrodynamics of the associated infinitely many
emergent conserved quantities automatically recovers the collisionless
Boltzmann equation that governs the dynamics of a Fermi liquid. Therefore, the
hydrodynamic prediction is that in the low-temperature, collisionless regime
where the emergent conservation laws hold, the dynamics and response to
external fields of a general spinless metal will be identical to a Fermi
liquid. We discuss some potential limitations to this general statement,
including the possibility of non-hydrodynamic modes. We also report some
interesting differences in the case of spinful metals.

a quasi two-dimensional material consisting of alternating layers of itinerant
Pd-electrons and Mott-insulating CrO$_2$ layers -- which shows a pronounced
regime of $T-$linear resistivity over a wide-range of intermediate

a closely related material PdCoO$_2$, where the CoO$_2$ layers are
band-insulators, we can rule out the traditional electron-phonon interactions
as being responsible for this interesting regime. We propose a previously
ignored electron-magnetoelastic interaction between the Pd-electrons, the Cr
local-moments and an out-of-plane phonon as the main scattering mechanism that
leads to the significant enhancement of resistivity and a $T-$linear regime in
PdCrO$_2$ at temperatures far in excess of the magnetic ordering temperature.

systems. SN 1987A offers one of the most promising examples of significant SN
dust formation, but until the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), instruments
have traditionally lacked the sensitivity at both late times (>1 yr
post-explosion) and longer wavelengths (i.e., >10 um) to detect analogous dust
reservoirs. Here we present JWST/MIRI observations of two historic Type IIP
SNe, 2004et and SN 2017eaw, at nearly 18 and 5 yr post-explosion, respectively.
We fit the spectral energy distributions as functions of dust mass and
temperature, from which we are able to constrain the dust geometry, origin, and
heating mechanism. We place a 90% confidence lower limit on the dust masses for
SNe 2004et and 2017eaw of >0.014 and >4e-4 M_sun, respectively. More dust may
exist at even colder temperatures or may be obscured by high optical depths. We
conclude dust formation in the ejecta to be the most plausible and consistent
scenario. The observed dust is radiatively heated to ~100-150 K by ongoing
shock interaction with the circumstellar medium. Regardless of the best fit or
heating mechanism adopted, the inferred dust mass for SN 2004et is the second
highest (next to SN 1987A) inferred dust mass in extragalactic SNe thus far,
promoting the prospect of SNe as potential significant sources of dust in the

Compared to a control sample of galaxies without gas flows (i.e., without MgII

SFGs with ouflow events (i.e., MgII absorption along the minor axis) are

explore multipole symmetries on arbitrary crystal lattices. We explain how,
given a crystal structure (specified by a space group and the occupied Wyckoff
positions), one may systematically construct all consistent multipole groups.
We focus on two-dimensional crystal structures for simplicity, although our
methods are general and extend straightforwardly to three dimensions. We
classify the possible multipole groups on all two-dimensional Bravais lattices,
and on the kagome and breathing kagome crystal structures to illustrate the
procedure on general crystal lattices. Using Wyckoff positions, we provide an
in-principle classification of all possible multipole groups in any space
group. We explain how, given a valid multipole group, one may construct an
effective Hamiltonian and a low-energy field theory. We then explore the
physical consequences, beginning by generalizing certain results originally
obtained on hypercubic lattices to arbitrary crystal structures. Next, we
identify two seemingly novel phenomena, including an emergent, robust subsystem
symmetry on the triangular lattice, and an exact multipolar symmetry on the
breathing kagome lattice that does not include conservation of charge
(monopole), but instead conserves a vector charge. This makes clear that there
is new physics to be found by exploring the consequences of multipolar
symmetries on arbitrary lattices, and this work provides the map for the
exploration thereof, as well as guiding the search for emergent multipolar

cluster is $\lesssim4\,$Myr old, is extremely massive $M_\star \sim
10^7\,M_\odot$ and yet has a central component as compact as several parsecs,
and we find a metallicity $Z=(0.22\pm0.03)\,Z_\odot$. The cluster is surrounded
by $\gtrsim 10^5\,M_\odot$ of dense clouds that have been pressurized to $P\sim
10^9\,{\rm K}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$ by perhaps stellar radiation at within ten
parsecs. These should have large neutral columns $N_{\rm HI} > 10^{22.5}\,{\rm
cm}^{-2}$ to survive rapid ejection by radiation pressure. The clouds are
likely dusty as they show gas-phase depletion of silicon, and may be conducive
to secondary star formation if $N_{\rm HI} > 10^{24}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}$ or if they
sink further toward the cluster center. Detecting strong ${\rm N
III]}\lambda\lambda$1750,1752, we infer heavy nitrogen enrichment $\log({\rm
N/O})=-0.21^{+0.10}_{-0.11}$. This requires efficiently retaining $\gtrsim
500\,M_\odot$ of nitrogen in the high-pressure clouds from massive stars
heavier than $60\,M_\odot$ up to 4 Myr. We suggest a physical origin of the
high-pressure clouds from partial or complete condensation of slow massive star
ejecta, which may have important implication for the puzzle of multiple stellar
populations in globular clusters.

we extend the analysis to a more general situation where RHNs are also produced
from the decay of the inflaton. The presence of these RHNs along with the
thermally generated ones (above its mass equivalent temperature only)
redistributes different components of the energy density of the Universe during
this reheating era, thereby affecting the charged lepton equilibration

temperature $T_{\rm{RH}}$. Taking both the effects into account, we find that
the decay of the lightest RHN in the set-up not only provides a platform to

Model neutrinos can naturally equilibrate with the neutrinos via oscillations
and scattering. In the presence of dark sector interactions, production of dark
fermions is generically suppressed above BBN, but then enhanced at later times.
Over much of the parameter space, we find that the dark sector equilibrates,
even for mixing angles $\theta_0$ as small as $10^{-13}$, and equilibration
occurs at $T_{\rm equil} \simeq m_{\nu d} \left(\theta_0^2 M_{Pl}/ m_{\nu d}
\right)^{1/5} $ which is naturally at most a few orders of magnitude above the
dark fermion mass. The implications of this are twofold: one, that light states
are often only constrained by the CMB and LSS without leaving an imprint on
BBN, and two, that sectors which equilibrate before recombination will
typically have a mass threshold before recombination, as well. This can result
in dark radiation abruptly transitioning from non-interacting to interacting,
or vice-versa, a ``step'' in the amount of dark radiation, and dark matter with
similar transitions in its interactions, all of which can leave important
signals in the CMB and LSS, and may be relevant for cosmological tensions in
observables such as $H_0$ or $S_8$. Minimal models leave an unambiguous imprint
on the CMB above the sensitivity of upcoming experiments.

debris that can be temporarily captured in geocentric orbits. Short-term
natural satellites are often called mini-moons. Reflectance spectroscopy can
determine the true nature of transient satellites because the spectral
signatures of spacecraft materials and near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are
different. The recently discovered object 2022 NX1 follows an Earth-like orbit
that turns it into a recurrent but ephemeral Earth companion. It has been
suggested that 2022 NX1 could have an artificial origin or be lunar ejecta.
  Aims. Here, we use reflectance spectroscopy and N-body simulations to
determine the nature and actual origin of 2022 NX1.
  Methods. We carried out an observational study of 2022 NX1, using the OSIRIS
camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias, to derive its
spectral class. N-body simulations were also performed to investigate how it
reached NEA space.
  Results. The reflectance spectrum of 2022 NX1 is neither compatible with an
artificial origin nor lunar ejecta; it is also different from the V type of the
only other mini-moon with available spectroscopy, 2020 CD3. The visible
spectrum of 2022 NX1 is consistent with that of a K-type asteroid, although it
could also be classified as an Xk type. Considering typical values of the
similar albedo of both K-type and Xk-type asteroids and its absolute magnitude,
2022 NX1 may have a size range of 5 to 15 m. We confirm that 2022 NX1 inhabits
the rim of Earth's co-orbital space, the 1:1 mean-motion resonance, and
experiences recurrent co-orbital engagements of the horseshoe-type and
mini-moon events.
  Conclusions. The discovery of 2022 NX1 confirms that mini-moons can be larger
than a few meters and also that they belong to a heterogeneous population in
terms of surface composition.

vary. Modeling of the Gap has revealed a sensitivity in its magnitude to a

well-known PRg=~154-day Rieger period and detected commonly in most

InSight mission marsquakes rates are periodic with PRg as characterized by a

>99%-significant spectral peak in the 385.8-64.3-nHz (1-180-day) band of
highest planetary energies; the longest-span (v.9) release of raw data revealed
the entire RR, excluding a tectonically active Mars. For check, I analyze rates

seismicity during traversals of the Earth magnetotail vs. IMF. The analysis
showed with >99-67% confidence and {\Phi}>>12 fidelity that (an unspecified
majority of) moonquakes and Mw5.6+ earthquakes also recur at Rieger periods.
About half of the spectral peaks split but also into clusters that average to
the usual Rieger periodicities, where magnetotail reconnecting clears the
signal. Earlier claims that solar plasma dynamics could be seismogenic due to
electrical surging or magnetohydrodynamic interactions between magnetically
trapped plasma and water molecules embedded within solid matter are confirmed.
This result calls for reinterpreting the seismicity phenomenon and for reliance
on global magnitude scales. The predictability of solar-wind macroscopic
dynamics is now within reach for the first time, which will benefit seismic and
weather prediction and the safety of space missions.

Reduced Order Models (GP-ROMs), derived by projecting the Navier-Stokes

popular because of their low computational costs and theoretical foundations.
However, the accuracy of traditional GP-ROMs degrades over long time prediction
horizons. To address this issue, we extend the recently proposed Neural
Galerkin Projection (NeuralGP) data driven framework to
compressibility-dominated transonic flow, considering a prototypical problem of
a buffeting NACA0012 airfoil governed by the full Navier-Stokes equations. The
algorithm maintains the form of the ROM-ODE obtained from the Galerkin
projection; however coefficients are learned directly from the data using
gradient descent facilitated by differentiable programming. This blends the
strengths of the physics driven GP-ROM and purely data driven neural
network-based techniques, resulting in a computationally cheaper model that is
easier to interpret. We show that the NeuralGP method minimizes a more rigorous
full trajectory error norm compared to a linearized error definition optimized
by the calibration procedure. We also find that while both procedures stabilize
the ROM by displacing the eigenvalues of the linear dynamics matrix of the
ROM-ODE to the complex left half-plane, the NeuralGP algorithm adds more
dissipation to the trailing POD modes resulting in its better long-term
performance. The results presented highlight the superior accuracy of the
NeuralGP technique compared to the traditional calibrated GP-ROM method.

learning dynamics are not well understood. We investigate the training dynamics
of large-graph GNNs using graph neural tangent kernels (GNTKs) and graphons. In
the limit of large width, optimization of an overparametrized NN is equivalent
to kernel regression on the NTK. Here, we investigate how the GNTK evolves as
another independent dimension is varied: the graph size. We use graphons to
define limit objects -- graphon NNs for GNNs, and graphon NTKs for GNTKs -- ,
and prove that, on a sequence of graphs, the GNTKs converge to the graphon NTK.
We further prove that the spectrum of the GNTK, which is related to the
directions of fastest learning which becomes relevant during early stopping,
converges to the spectrum of the graphon NTK. This implies that in the
large-graph limit, the GNTK fitted on a graph of moderate size can be used to
solve the same task on the large graph, and to infer the learning dynamics of
the large-graph GNN. These results are verified empirically on node regression
and classification tasks.

Our key contribution is a new equivariant rotation prediction network called
Neural Euler's Rotation Equations (NERE) for SE(3) score matching. It predicts
a rotation by modeling the force and torque between protein and ligand atoms,
where the force is defined as the gradient of an energy function with respect

phylogenetic networks sitting between rooted (directed) and unrooted

undirected edges. While the spaces of rooted phylogenetic networks and unrooted
phylogenetic networks have been analyzed in recent years and various
rearrangement moves to traverse these spaces have been introduced, the results
do not immediately carry over to semi-directed phylogenetic networks. Here, we
propose a simple rearrangement move for semi-directed phylogenetic networks,
called cut edge transfer (CET), and show that the space of semi-directed
level-$1$ networks with precisely $k$ reticulations is connected under CET.
This level-$1$ space is currently the predominantly used search space for most
algorithms that reconstruct semi-directed phylogenetic networks. Hence, every
semi-directed level-$1$ network with a fixed number of reticulations and leaf
set can be reached from any other such network by a sequence of CETs. By
introducing two additional moves, CET$^+$ and CET$^-$, that allow for the
addition or deletion of reticulations, we then establish connectedness for the
space of all semi-directed phylogenetic networks on a fixed leaf set. As a
byproduct of our results for semi-directed phylogenetic networks, we also show
that the space of rooted level-$1$ networks with a fixed number of

further reduce the achievable degree of entanglement even in the limit of
vanishing temperature due to phonon-induced pure dephasing and phonon-assisted

addition, the degree of entanglement, as measured by the concurrence, decreases
with rising temperature and/or pulse duration, even if the excitonic

pathway to significant developments in the field of thermoelectricity. Here, we
conduct a comparative study of three chemically similar antimonides to
establish the root causes of their extraordinarily low thermal conductivity
($0.4-0.6$ Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 525 K). The materials of interest are: the
unconventional type-XI clathrate K$_{58}$Zn$_{122}$Sb$_{207}$, the tunnel
compound K$_{6.9}$Zn$_{21}$Sb$_{16}$, and the type-I clathrate
K$_8$Zn$_{15.5}$Cu$_{2.5}$Sb$_{28}$ discovered herein. Calculations of the
phonon dispersions show that the type-XI compound exhibits localized (i.e.,
rattling) phonon modes with unusually low frequencies that span the entire
acoustic regime. In contrast, rattling in the type-I clathrate is observed only
at higher frequencies, and no rattling modes are present in the tunnel
structure. Modeling reveals that low-frequency rattling modes profoundly limit
the acoustic scattering time; the scattering time of the type-XI clathrate is
half that of the type-I clathrate and a quarter of the tunnel compound. For all
three materials, the thermal conductivities are additionally suppressed by soft
framework bonding that lowers the acoustic group velocities, and structural
complexity that leads to diffusonic character of the optical modes.
Understanding details of thermal transport in structurally complex materials
will be crucial for developing the next generation of thermoelectrics.

the state-of-the-art PdM attacks by 3X. Furthermore, we present a novel
approximate adversarial training method to defend against adversarial attacks.
We observe that approximate adversarial training can significantly improve the

specifying car lengths and requiring that a car attempts to park in the first
available spot after its preference. If it does not fit there, then a collision
occurs and the car fails to park. In contrast, parking assortments generalize
parking sequences (and parking functions) by allowing cars (also of assorted
lengths) to seek forward from their preference to identify a set of contiguous
unoccupied spots in which they fit. We consider both parking sequences and
parking assortments and establish that the number of preferences resulting in a
fixed parking order $\sigma$ is related to the lengths of cars indexed by
certain subsequences in $\sigma$. The sum of these numbers over all parking
orders (i.e. permutations of $[n]$) yields new formulas for the total number of
parking sequences and of parking assortments.

work extends previously reported implementation of QPP used to encrypt basis
states and demonstrates that application of the QPP scheme is not limited to
the encryption of basis states. For this implementation, a pad of 56 2-qubit
Permutation matrices was used, providing 256 bits of entropy for the QPP
algorithm. An image of a cat was used as the plaintext for this experiment. To
create corresponding superposition states, we applied a novel operator defined
in this paper. These superposition states were then encrypted using QPP,
producing superposition ciphertext states. Due to the lack of a quantum
channel, we omitted the transmission and executed the decryption procedure on
the same IBM quantum system. If a quantum channel existed, the superposition
ciphertext states could be transmitted as qubits, and be directly decrypted on
a different quantum system. We provide a brief discussion of the security,
although the focus of the paper remains on the implementation. Previously we
have demonstrated QPP operating in both classical and quantum computers,
offering an interesting opportunity to bridge the security gap between
classical and quantum systems. This work broadens the applicability of QPP for
the encryption of basis states as well as superposition states.

has been an issue of paramount importance in fluid mechanics. While the
bifurcations at low Rayleigh number, when the flow is laminar or moderately
chaotic, have been fully understood for a long time, transitions at higher
Rayleigh number are much more difficult to be clearly identified. Here, through
a numerical study of the two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection covering
four decades in Rayleigh number for two different Prandtl numbers, we find a
clear-cut transition by considering the fluctuations of the heat flux through a
horizontal plane, rather than its mean value. More specifically, we have found
that this sharp transition is displayed by a jump of the ratio of the
root-mean-square fluctuations of the heat flux to its mean value and occurs at
$Ra/Pr \approx 10^9$. Above the transition, this ratio is found to be constant
in all regions of the flow, while taking different values in the bulk and at
the boundaries. Below the transition instead, different behaviors are observed
at the boundaries and in the bulk: at the boundaries, this ratio decreases with
respect to the Rayleigh number whereas it is found to be constant in the bulk
for all values of the Rayleigh number. Through this numerical evidence and an
analytical reasoning we confirm what was already observed in experiments, that
is the decrease of the ratio of root-mean-square fluctuations of the heat flux
to its mean value, observed at the boundaries below the transition, can
understood in terms of the law of large numbers.

networks. Many advances in pruning leverage concepts from the Lottery Ticket
Hypothesis (LTH). LTH reveals that inside a trained dense network exists sparse
subnetworks (tickets) able to achieve similar accuracy (i.e., win the lottery -
winning tickets). Pruning at initialization focuses on finding winning tickets
without training a dense network. Studies on these concepts share the trend
that subnetworks come from weight or filter pruning. In this work, we
investigate LTH and pruning at initialization from the lens of layer pruning.
First, we confirm the existence of winning tickets when the pruning process
removes layers. Leveraged by this observation, we propose to discover these
winning tickets at initialization, eliminating the requirement of heavy
computational resources for training the initial (over-parameterized) dense
network. Extensive experiments show that our winning tickets notably speed up
the training phase and reduce up to 51% of carbon emission, an important step
towards democratization and green Artificial Intelligence. Beyond computational
benefits, our winning tickets exhibit robustness against adversarial and
out-of-distribution examples. Finally, we show that our subnetworks easily win
the lottery at initialization while tickets from filter removal (the standard
structured LTH) hardly become winning tickets.

easier to see the overview of data groupings. The size and aspect ratio of

model global contextual correlation. To further extract rich representations,
some extensions of the U-Net employ multi-scale feature extraction and fusion
modules and obtain improved performance. Inspired by this idea, we propose
TransCeption for medical image segmentation, a pure transformer-based U-shape
network featured by incorporating the inception-like module into the encoder
and adopting a contextual bridge for better feature fusion. The design proposed
in this work is based on three core principles: (1) The patch merging module in
the encoder is redesigned with ResInception Patch Merging (RIPM). Multi-branch
transformer (MB transformer) adopts the same number of branches as the outputs
of RIPM. Combining the two modules enables the model to capture a multi-scale
representation within a single stage. (2) We construct an Intra-stage Feature
Fusion (IFF) module following the MB transformer to enhance the aggregation of
feature maps from all the branches and particularly focus on the interaction
between the different channels of all the scales. (3) In contrast to a bridge
that only contains token-wise self-attention, we propose a Dual Transformer
Bridge that also includes channel-wise self-attention to exploit correlations
between scales at different stages from a dual perspective. Extensive
experiments on multi-organ and skin lesion segmentation tasks present the
superior performance of TransCeption compared to previous work. The code is

was to evaluate the effect of surfactant and sonication time on the

emulsion evaporation method was used to encapsulate lycopene in poly-lactic
co-glycolic acid (PLGA) with surfactant concentration, sonication time and
polymer concentration as independent variables. Physicochemical and
morphological characteristics were measured with a zetasizer and SEM, while the
encapsulation efficiency and controlled release kinetics with
spectrophotometric, and the dialysis method was used to estimate
bioaccessibility. The results have shown sonication time to have significantly
(p < 0.05) influenced the encapsulation efficiency. Hence, the sonication time
of 4 min yield an encapsulation efficiency of 78% and increased to 97% with
increase sonication time (6 min). Increased sonication time had a decreasing
effect on the hydrodynamic diameter and stability of the encapsulated
nanoparticles. The slow release of lycopene was observed during the first 12
days, followed by a burst release of about 44% on the 13th day in-vitro. The
study will have significant impact on the manufacturing of functional food with

the wellbore to a perforation. Consequently, the paper considers both of these
phenomena independently at first, and then they are combined to address the

calculating the particle and velocity profiles within the wellbore is
developed. The model is calibrated against available laboratory data for
various flow velocities, particle diameters, pipe diameters, and particle

that involves the selection of an algorithm and its associated parameters. How
to choose the most appropriate algorithm generally depends on the type of
network being analyzed and the specific properties of the data that define the
network. In functional temporal networks derived from neuronal spike train
data, communities are expected to be transient, and it is common for the
network to contain multiple singleton communities. Here, we compare the
performance of different DCD algorithms on functional temporal networks built
from synthetic neuronal time series data with known community structure. We
find that, for these networks, DCD algorithms that utilize interlayer links to
perform community carryover between layers outperform other methods. However,
we also observe that algorithm performance is highly dependent on the topology
of interlayer links, especially in the presence of singleton and transient
communities. We therefore define a novel method for defining interlayer links
in temporal networks called skeleton coupling that is specifically designed to
enhance the linkage of communities in the network throughout time based on the
topological properties of the community history. We show that integrating
skeleton coupling with current DCD methods improves algorithm performance in
synthetic data with planted singleton and transient communities. The use of
skeleton coupling to perform DCD will therefore allow for more accurate and
interpretable results of community evolution in real-world neuronal data or in
other systems with transient structure and singleton communities.

Type IA supernova, tend to yield larger values than measurements from
quantities originating at high-redshift, e.g., fits of cosmic microwave
background radiation. It is becoming likely that the discrepancy, currently
standing at $5\sigma$, is not due to systematic errors in the measurements.
Here we explore whether the self-interaction of gravitational fields in General
Relativity, which are traditionally neglected when studying the evolution of
the universe, can explain the tension. We find that with field self-interaction
accounted for, both low- and high-redshift data are simultaneously well-fitted,
thereby showing that gravitational self-interaction could explain the Hubble

quantum rotations and is an extremely sensitive torque and force detector. It
has been proposed to probe fundamental particle-surface interactions such as
the Casimir torque and the rotational quantum vacuum friction, which require it
to be driven to rotate near a surface at sub-micrometer separations. Here, we
optically levitate a silica nanodumbbell in a vacuum at about 430 nm away from
a sapphire surface and drive it to rotate at GHz frequencies. The relative
linear speed between the tip of the nanodumbbell and the surface reaches 1.4
km/s at a sub-micrometer separation. The rotating nanodumbbell near the surface
demonstrates a torque sensitivity of $(5.0 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{-26} {\rm
NmHz}^{-1/2}$ at room temperature. Moreover, we levitate a nanodumbbell near a
gold nanograting and use it to probe the near-field intensity distribution
beyond the optical diffraction limit. Our numerical simulation shows it is
promising to detect the Casimir torque between a nanodumbbell and a
nanograting.

was also filled with activity of both radionuclides. We simulated multiple
phantom configurations and activity combinations by varying the location of the

amount of background activity. We investigated two different scatter window
widths to be used with triple energy window (TEW) scatter correction. We also
created multiple realizations of each configuration to improve our assessment,
leading to a total of 540 simulations. Each configuration was imaged using a
simulated Siemens SPECT camera. The projections were reconstructed using the
standard 3D OSEM algorithm, and errors associated with $^{177}$Lu activity
quantification and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were determined. In all
configurations, the quantification error was within $\pm$6% of the no-$^{90}$Y
case, and we found that quantitative accuracy may slightly improve when
$^{90}$Y is present because of reduction of errors associated with TEW scatter
correction. The CNRs were not significantly impacted by the presence of
$^{90}$Y, but they were increased when a wider scatter window width was used
for TEW scatter correction. The width of the scatter windows made a small but
statistically significant difference of 1-2% on the recovered $^{177}$Lu

of $^{177}$Lu and lesion detectability is not degraded by the presence of
$^{90}$Y.

complementary in checking specifications against stated requirements and
proposes some answers. A second aim is to provide a comparison between
different executable frameworks that have been developed for the same
specification languages. Thus, the ASM discussion is complemented by executable
Corinthian ASM (CASM) and CoreASM models. Similarly, the two TLA$^+$
specifications presented, which rely on the TLC and Apalache model checkers,
respectively, are complemented by a Quint specification, a new language
developed by Informal Systems to serve as a user-friendly syntax layer for

Alternating Bit (AB) protocol because it is a simple and well-understood
protocol already extensively analysed in the literature. While the models
reported here and developed with the two methods are semantically equivalent,
ASMs and Quint are better suited for top-down specification from abstract
requirements by iterative refinement. TLA$^+$ seems to be more easily used
bottom-up, to build abstractions on top of verified components in spite of the
fact that it, too, emphasizes iterative refinement. In the final section, the
report begins to scope out the possibility of a homomorphism between the

combines augmentation to increase cell density using a low-density cell image

  (EFIDL)",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Introduction Data imbalance is one of the crucial issues in big data analysis
with fewer labels. For example, in real-world healthcare data, spam detection
labels, and financial fraud detection datasets. Many data balance methods were
introduced to improve machine learning algorithms' performance. Research claims
SMOTE and SMOTE-based data-augmentation (generate new data points) methods
could improve algorithm performance. However, we found in many online
tutorials, the valuation methods were applied based on synthesized datasets
that introduced bias into the evaluation, and the performance got a false
improvement. In this study, we proposed, a new evaluation framework for
imbalanced data learning methods. We have experimented on five data balance
methods and whether the performance of algorithms will improve or not. Methods
We collected 8 imbalanced healthcare datasets with different imbalanced rates
from different domains. Applied 6 data augmentation methods with 11 machine
learning methods testing if the data augmentation will help with improving
machine learning performance. We compared the traditional data augmentation
evaluation methods with our proposed cross-validation evaluation framework
Results Using traditional data augmentation evaluation meta hods will give a
false impression of improving the performance. However, our proposed evaluation
method shows data augmentation has limited ability to improve the results.
Conclusion EFIDL is more suitable for evaluating the prediction performance of
an ML method when data are augmented. Using an unsuitable evaluation framework
will give false results. Future researchers should consider the evaluation
framework we proposed when dealing with augmented datasets. Our experiments
showed data augmentation does not help improve ML prediction performance.

the MS stars span a wide color range, where the majority of M-dwarfs exhibit
blue colors, and a tail of stars are distributed toward the red. A similar

populations of M-dwarfs are also visible in the optical F606W vs. F606W-F814W

smaller than 0.1 solar masses. We introduce a chromosome map of M-dwarfs that
reveals an extended first population and three main groups of second-population

composition, we simulate colors and magnitudes of different stellar populations

identify the photometric bands that provide the most efficient diagrams to

the colors of first- and second-population M-dwarfs is similar to that inferred
from spectroscopy of red giants, constraining the proposal that the chemical
variations are due to mass transfer phenomena in proto-clusters.

The ADSB brain architecture is made up of the Experience Referencing Engine

scales, can offer surprisingly large fluorescence enhancements, up to $F\sim
10^4$. Our numerical simulations reveal that the enhancement originates from
multipolar ($4 \lesssim \ell \lesssim 10$) resonances, which induce strong
electric field enhancement within spheres without requiring the engineering of
sophisticated shapes, precise nanogaps, generation of hot spots, or designer
metasurfaces. The order, $\ell$, of these resonances is larger than
conventionally utilized dipolar or quadrupolar Mie resonances in nanoparticles
and smaller than of typical whispering gallery modes ($\ell \gtrsim 20$) in
microparticles. With the absence of non-radiative Ohmic losses inherent to
plasmonic particles, we show that $F$ can increase, decrease or even stay the

intact radiative decay rates of a fluorophore, respectively. Further, the
fluorophore may be located inside or outside the particle, providing additional

graph convolutional networks (GCNs) exploit intra-sequence context to construct
adaptive graphs for feature aggregation. However, we argue that such context is
still \textit{local} since the rich cross-sequence relations have not been
explicitly investigated. In this paper, we propose a graph contrastive learning
framework for skeleton-based action recognition (\textit{SkeletonGCL}) to
explore the \textit{global} context across all sequences. In specific,
SkeletonGCL associates graph learning across sequences by enforcing graphs to
be class-discriminative, \emph{i.e.,} intra-class compact and inter-class
dispersed, which improves the GCN capacity to distinguish various action
patterns. Besides, two memory banks are designed to enrich cross-sequence
context from two complementary levels, \emph{i.e.,} instance and semantic
levels, enabling graph contrastive learning in multiple context scales.
Consequently, SkeletonGCL establishes a new training paradigm, and it can be
seamlessly incorporated into current GCNs. Without loss of generality, we
combine SkeletonGCL with three GCNs (2S-ACGN, CTR-GCN, and InfoGCN), and
achieve consistent improvements on NTU60, NTU120, and NW-UCLA benchmarks. The

scaling relationship with the wall-distance. The attached eddy model has
emerged as an elegant and successful theory to explain the physics, structure
and statistics of the logarithmic layer in wall turbulence. Building on the
statistical framework of Woodcock and Marusic (2015), the present work details
quantitative results on the structure of the attached eddies and their impact
on velocity moment predictions. An inverse problem is posed to infer the ideal
eddy contribution function that yields precise first and second order velocity
moments obtained from direct numerical simulations. This ideal function is
further simplified and is used to guide the proposal of a hairpin-type
prototypical eddy which is shown to yield reasonable predictions of the
velocity moments. This hairpin-type structure is improved upon by a) solving a
constrained optimization problem to infer an idealized eddy shape, and b)
inferring the circulation distribution of a hairpin packet. The associated
forward and inverse modeling procedure is general enough to serve as a
foundation to model the flow beyond the log layer and the codes are open
sourced to the community to aid further research.

component of human communication, as it allows individuals to understand and
respond to emotions conveyed through facial expressions and vocal tones. The
recognition of facial emotions is a complex cognitive process that involves the
integration of visual and auditory information, as well as prior knowledge and
social cues. It plays a crucial role in social interaction, affective
processing, and empathy, and is an important aspect of many real-world
applications, including human-computer interaction, virtual assistants, and
mental health diagnosis and treatment. The development of accurate and
efficient models for facial emotion recognition is therefore of great
importance and has the potential to have a significant impact on various fields
of study.The field of Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is of great significance
in the areas of computer vision and artificial intelligence, with vast
commercial and academic potential in fields such as security, advertising, and
entertainment. We propose a FER framework that employs Swin Vision Transformers
(SwinT) and squeeze and excitation block (SE) to address vision tasks. The
approach uses a transformer model with an attention mechanism, SE, and SAM to
improve the efficiency of the model, as transformers often require a large
amount of data. Our focus was to create an efficient FER model based on SwinT
architecture that can recognize facial emotions using minimal data. We trained
our model on a hybrid dataset and evaluated its performance on the AffectNet
dataset, achieving an F1-score of 0.5420, which surpassed the winner of the
Affective Behavior Analysis in the Wild (ABAW) Competition held at the European
Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) 2022~\cite{Kollias}.

successfully decompose clusters into their collisionless and collisional mass
components thanks to the X-ray surface brightness, as well as using the
dynamics of cluster members to obtain more accurate masses with the fundamental
plane of elliptical galaxies. Knowledge from all observables is included
through a consistent Bayesian approach in the likelihood or in physically
motivated priors. We apply this method to the galaxy cluster Abell S1063 and
produce a mass model that we publicly release with this paper. The resulting
mass distribution presents a different ellipticities for the intra-cluster gas
and the other large-scale mass components; and deviation from elliptical
symmetry in the main halo. We assess the ability of our method to recover the
masses of the different elements of the cluster using a mock cluster based on a
simplified version of our Abell S1063 model. Thanks to the wealth of
information provided by the mass model and the X-ray emission, we also found
evidence for an on-going merger event with gas sloshing from a smaller
infalling structure into the main cluster. In agreement with previous findings,
the total mass, gas profile and gas mass fraction are consistent with small
deviations from the hydrostatic equilibrium. This new mass model for Abell

within an image: \emph{Cognitive Distillation} (CD). The idea is to extract the
""minimal essence"" from an input image responsible for the model's prediction.
CD optimizes an input mask to extract a small pattern from the input image that
can lead to the same model output (i.e., logits or deep features). The
extracted pattern can help understand the cognitive mechanism of a model on
clean vs. backdoor images and is thus called a \emph{Cognitive Pattern} (CP).
Using CD and the distilled CPs, we uncover an interesting phenomenon of
backdoor attacks: despite the various forms and sizes of trigger patterns used
by different attacks, the CPs of backdoor samples are all surprisingly and
suspiciously small. One thus can leverage the learned mask to detect and remove
backdoor examples from poisoned training datasets. We conduct extensive
experiments to show that CD can robustly detect a wide range of advanced
backdoor attacks. We also show that CD can potentially be applied to help
detect potential biases from face datasets. Code is available at

and enumerate possible feature interactions to improve performance based on the
input feature set. Therefore, when selecting an optimal feature set, we should
consider the influence of both feature and its interaction. However, most
previous works focus on either feature field selection or only select feature
interaction based on the fixed feature set to produce the feature set. The
former restricts search space to the feature field, which is too coarse to
determine subtle features. They also do not filter useless feature
interactions, leading to higher computation costs and degraded model
performance. The latter identifies useful feature interaction from all
available features, resulting in many redundant features in the feature set. In
this paper, we propose a novel method named OptFS to address these problems. To
unify the selection of feature and its interaction, we decompose the selection
of each feature interaction into the selection of two correlated features. Such
a decomposition makes the model end-to-end trainable given various feature
interaction operations. By adopting feature-level search space, we set a
learnable gate to determine whether each feature should be within the feature
set. Because of the large-scale search space, we develop a
learning-by-continuation training scheme to learn such gates. Hence, OptFS
generates the feature set only containing features which improve the final
prediction results. Experimentally, we evaluate OptFS on three public datasets,
demonstrating OptFS can optimize feature sets which enhance the model
performance and further reduce both the storage and computational cost.

it can also be unreliable when the model is misspecified. Bayesian modular
inference is concerned with complex models which have been specified through a
collection of coupled submodels, and is useful when there is misspecification
in some of the submodels. The submodels are often called modules in the
literature. Cutting feedback is a widely used Bayesian modular inference method
which ensures that information from suspect model components is not used in
making inferences about parameters in correctly specified modules. However, it
may be hard to decide in what circumstances this ``cut posterior'' is preferred
to the exact posterior. When misspecification is not severe, cutting feedback
may increase the uncertainty in Bayesian posterior inference greatly without
reducing estimation bias substantially. This motivates semi-modular inference
methods, which avoid the binary cut of cutting feedback approaches. In this
work, we precisely formalize the bias-variance trade-off involved in
semi-modular inference for the first time in the literature, using a framework
of local model misspecification. We then implement a mixture-based semi-modular
inference approach, demonstrating theoretically that it delivers inferences
that are more accurate, in terms of a user-defined loss function, than either
the cut or full posterior on its own. The new method is demonstrated in a

factors emotion valence (positive; negative) and music (withoutMUSIC:
script-driven imagery of emotional scenes; withMUSIC: script-driven imagery of
emotional scenes and simultaneously listening to affectively congruent music).
The baseline condition was imagery of neutral scenes in the absence of music.
Eleven females and five males participated in this fMRI study. The contrasts of
positive and negative withoutMUSIC conditions minus the baseline (imagery of
neutral scenes) showed no significant activation. When comparing the withMUSIC
to withoutMUSIC conditions, activity in a number of emotion-related regions was
observed, including the temporal pole (TP), amygdala, hippocampus,
hypothalamus, anterior ventral tegmental area (VTA), locus coeruleus, and
anterior cerebellum. We hypothesized that the TP may integrate music and the
imagined scene to extract socioemotional significance, initiating the
subcortical structures to generate subjective feelings and bodily responses.
For the withMUSIC conditions, negative emotions were associated with enhanced
activation in the posterior VTA compared to positive emotions. Our findings
replicated and extended previous research which suggests that different
subregions of the VTA are sensitive to rewarding and aversive stimuli. Taken
together, this study suggests that emotional music embedded in an imagined

alleviate the problem in the dynamic environment? Concretely, we conduct a
comprehensive data-driven study through simulation experiments of political
polarization in news recommendations based on 40,000 annotated news articles.
We find that users are rapidly exposed to more extreme content as the

slow down this polarization, but leaves open significant opportunities for

unexplored due to unavailability of dataset. In order to assist this research,
we present a multi-modal egocentric activity dataset for continual learning

first-person camera and wearable sensors. It contains synchronized data of

approach for building efficient deep-learning models. However, commodity
accelerators are built mainly for efficient dense computation, creating a huge
gap for general sparse computation to leverage. Existing solutions have to use
time-consuming compiling to improve the efficiency of sparse kernels in an
ahead-of-time manner and thus are limited to static sparsity. A wide range of
dynamic sparsity opportunities is missed because their sparsity patterns are
only known at runtime. This limits the future of building more biological
brain-like neural networks that should be dynamically and sparsely activated.
  In this paper, we bridge the gap between sparse computation and commodity
accelerators by proposing a system, called Spider, for efficiently executing
deep learning models with dynamic sparsity. We identify an important property
called permutation invariant that applies to most deep-learning computations.
The property enables Spider (1) to extract dynamic sparsity patterns of tensors
that are only known at runtime with little overhead; and (2) to transform the
dynamic sparse computation into an equivalent dense computation which has been
extremely optimized on commodity accelerators. Extensive evaluation on diverse
models shows Spider can extract and transform dynamic sparsity with negligible
overhead but brings up to 9.4x speedup over state-of-art solutions.

aggregation. We find these schemes are equivalent to or even just a subset of
the basic self-attention mechanism. In this paper, we prove that the vanilla
self-attention structure is sufficient for information aggregation, and
structural adaption is unnecessary. The key is not the attention structure, but
how to extract the discriminative feature for tracking and enhance the

adopt the basic vision transformer (ViT) architecture as our main tracker and
concatenate the template and search image for feature embedding. To guide the
encoder to capture the invariant feature for tracking, we attach a lightweight
correlative masked decoder which reconstructs the original template and search
image from the corresponding masked tokens. The correlative masked decoder
serves as a plugin for the compact transform tracker and is skipped in
inference. Our compact tracker uses the most simple structure which only
consists of a ViT backbone and a box head, and can run at 40 fps. Extensive

programmers use locks. However, programs can eliminate data races only when
they acquire and release correct locks at correct timing. The lock API of C, in
which people have developed a large portion of legacy system programs, does not
validate the correct use of locks. On the other hand, Rust, a recently
developed system programming language, provides a lock API that guarantees the
correct use of locks via type checking. This makes rewriting legacy system
programs in Rust a promising way to retrofit safety into them. Unfortunately,
manual C-to-Rust translation is extremely laborious due to the discrepancies
between their lock APIs. Even the state-of-the-art automatic C-to-Rust

platform, the decentralized platform is powered by blockchain technology, which
allows for secure and transparent Peer-to-Peer transactions among users.
Traditional single-chain-based blockchains suffer from the well-known
blockchain trilemma. Beyond the single-chain-based scheme, decentralized
high-throughput blockchains adopt parallel protocols to reconcile the
blockchain trilemma, implementing any tasking and desired allocation. However,
unneglectable network latency may induce partial observability, resulting in
incoordination and misallocation issues for the decentralized transaction
packaging process at the current high-throughput blockchain protocols.
  To address this problem, we consider a strategic coordination mechanism for
the decentralized transaction packaging process by using a game-theoretic
approach. Under a tractable two-period model, we find a Bayesian Nash
equilibrium of the miner's strategic transaction packaging under partial
observability. Along with novel algorithms for computing equilibrium payoffs,
we show that the decentralized platform can achieve an efficient and stable

the first-order gradient oracles are available. While numerous optimization
methods have been proposed for tackling bilevel problems, existing methods
either tend to require possibly expensive calculations regarding Hessians of
lower-level objectives, or lack rigorous finite-time performance guarantees. In
this work, we propose a Fully First-order Stochastic Approximation (F2SA)
method, and study its non-asymptotic convergence properties. Specifically, we
show that F2SA converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary solution of the bilevel
problem after $\epsilon^{-7/2}, \epsilon^{-5/2}$, and $\epsilon^{-3/2}$
iterations (each iteration using $O(1)$ samples) when stochastic noises are in
both level objectives, only in the upper-level objective, and not present
(deterministic settings), respectively. We further show that if we employ
momentum-assisted gradient estimators, the iteration complexities can be
improved to $\epsilon^{-5/2}, \epsilon^{-4/2}$, and $\epsilon^{-3/2}$,
respectively. We demonstrate even superior practical performance of the
proposed method over existing second-order based approaches on MNIST
data-hypercleaning experiments.

function called target function to decide the destination from the robots'

From the view point of compatibility, we investigate the convergence, the fault

to $f$ points (FC($f$)-PO), the fault tolerant ($n,f$)-convergence to a convex
$f$-gon (FC($f$)-CP), and the gathering problems, assuming crash failures.
Obtained results classify these problems into three groups: The convergence,

year with broad-band and narrow-band filters. We derived the production rates
of five gaseous species, e.g. OH, NH, CN, C$_3$ and C$_2$, using a Haser model
as well as the A($\theta$)f$\rho$, dust proxy parameter. The comet was also
observed with two optical high resolution spectrographs UVES and ESPRESSO
mounted on the 8-m ESO VLT to measure the isotopic ratios of C and N, the
oxygen forbidden lines ratios and the NH$_2$ ortho-to-para ratios. We followed
during almost a year the rise and decline of the production rates of different
species as well as the dust activity of 46P on both pre- and post-perihelion.
Relative abundances with respect to CN and OH along the orbit of the comet show
constant and symmetric abundance ratios and a typical coma composition. We
determined the rotation period of the nucleus using high cadence observations
and long series of CN images on several nights, and we obtained a value of
(9.18$\pm$0.05) hr at perihelion. Using high resolution spectra of 46P coma, we
derived C and N isotopic ratios of 100$\pm$20 and 150$\pm$30 and a green-to-red
forbidden oxygen [OI] lines ratio of 0.23$\pm$0.02. We measured a NH$_2$

GNNs show strong empirical performance in many practical tasks. However, the
theoretical properties have not been completely elucidated. In this paper, we
investigate whether GNNs can exploit the graph structure from the perspective
of the expressive power of GNNs. In our analysis, we consider graph generation
processes that are controlled by hidden (or latent) node features, which
contain all information about the graph structure. A typical example of this
framework is kNN graphs constructed from the hidden features. In our main
results, we show that GNNs can recover the hidden node features from the input
graph alone, even when all node features, including the hidden features
themselves and any indirect hints, are unavailable. GNNs can further use the
recovered node features for downstream tasks. These results show that GNNs can
fully exploit the graph structure by themselves, and in effect, GNNs can use
both the hidden and explicit node features for downstream tasks. In the
experiments, we confirm the validity of our results by showing that GNNs can
accurately recover the hidden features using a GNN architecture built based on

data (i.e., user-item interaction data) are kept locally on their personal
devices, therefore, it is considered a fairly secure approach to protect user
privacy. As a result, the privacy issue of FedRecs is rarely explored.
Unfortunately, several recent studies reveal that FedRecs are vulnerable to
user attribute inference attacks, highlighting the privacy concerns of FedRecs.
In this paper, we further investigate the privacy problem of user behavior data
(i.e., user-item interactions) in FedRecs. Specifically, we perform the first
systematic study on interaction-level membership inference attacks on FedRecs.
An interaction-level membership inference attacker is first designed, and then
the classical privacy protection mechanism, Local Differential Privacy (LDP),
is adopted to defend against the membership inference attack. Unfortunately,
the empirical analysis shows that LDP is not effective against such new attacks
unless the recommendation performance is largely compromised. To mitigate the
interaction-level membership attack threats, we design a simple yet effective
defense method to significantly reduce the attacker's inference accuracy
without losing recommendation performance. Extensive experiments are conducted
with two widely used FedRecs (Fed-NCF and Fed-LightGCN) on three real-world

justify the transfer characteristics and robustness of the time-delay control

for deploying the controller, that comes in favor of applications. An otherwise
inherently instable proportional-integral (PI) feedback of the non-collocated

chromatic dispersion of CMOS devices is large and impairs generation of
broadband microcombs. Here, we report the development of a microresonator in
which GVD is reduced due to a couple-ring resonator configuration. Operating in
the turnkey self-injection-locking mode, the resonator is hybridly integrated
with a semiconductor laser pump to produce high-power-efficiency combs spanning
a bandwidth of 9.9 nm (1.22 THz) centered at 1560 nm, corresponding to 62 comb
lines. Fast, linear optical sampling of the comb waveform is used to observe
the rich set of near-zero GVD comb behaviors, including soliton molecules,
switching waves (platicons) and their hybrids. Tuning of the 20 GHz repetition
rate by electrical actuation enables servo locking to a microwave reference,
which simultaneously stabilizes the comb repetition rate, offset frequency and
temporal waveform. This hybridly integrated system could be used in coherent
communications or for ultra-stable microwave signal generation by two-point

measure magnetism and structure at the two interfaces of FeCoB, namely,
FeCoB-on-MgO and MgO-on-FeCoB, independently, yielding an intriguing result
that both interfaces are not symmetric. A high-density layer with an increased
magnetic hyperfine field at the FeCoB-on-MgO interface suggests different
growth mechanisms at the two interfaces. The azimuthal angle-dependent
magneto-optic Kerr effect measurements reveal the presence of unusual uniaxial
magnetic anisotropy (UMA) in the trilayer. An in-situ temperature-dependent
study discovered that this UMA systematically reduces with temperature. The
trilayer becomes isotropic at 450C with an order-of-magnitude increase in
coercivity. The asymmetry at the interfaces is, in turn, explained by boron
diffusion from the FeCoB interface layer into the nearby MgO layer.
Stress-induced UMA is observed in the boron-deficient FeCoB layer, superimposed
with the bulk FeCoB layer, and found to be responsible for unusual UMA. The
temperature-dependent variation in the UMA and coercivity can be understood in
terms of variations in the internal stresses and coupling between FeCoB bulk

demonstrated that mode locks through the formation of pulse pairs in
normal-dispersion coupled-ring resonators. Unlike conventional microcombs,
pulses in this system cannot exist alone, and instead must phase lock in pairs
to form a bright soliton comb. Also, the pulses can form at recurring spectral
windows and the pulses in each pair feature different optical spectra. This
pairwise mode-locking modality extends to higher dimensions and we demonstrate
3-ring systems in which 3 pulses mode lock through alternating pairwise pulse
coupling. The results are demonstrated using the new CMOS-foundry platform that
has not previously produced bright solitons on account of its inherent normal
dispersion. The ability to generate multi-color pulse pairs over multiple rings
is an important new feature for microcombs. It can extend the concept of
all-optical soliton buffers and memories to multiple storage rings that
multiplex pulses with respect to soliton color and that are spatially
addressable. The results also suggest a new platform for the study of quantum

coordination (TS-FL-ASC) are investigated. To address straggler effect in

A server dropping-based solution is proposed to allow slow-performance edge
servers to be removed from participating in model training if their impact on
the resulting model accuracy is limited. A joint optimization algorithm is
proposed to minimize the overall time consumption of model training by
selecting participating edge servers, local epoch number. We develop an
analytical expression to characterize the impact of staleness effect of

$T_{\nu,\nu'}$ denotes the electron transmission rate from the left $K_{\nu'}$

Focused Topic Model. Indeed, we develop a neural model for topic evolution
which exploits sequences of Bernoulli random variables in order to track the
appearances of topics, thereby decoupling their activities from their
proportions. We evaluate our model on three different datasets (the UN general
debates, the collection of NeurIPS papers, and the ACL Anthology dataset) and
show that it (i) outperforms state-of-the-art topic models in generalization
tasks and (ii) performs comparably to them on prediction tasks, while employing
roughly the same number of parameters, and converging about two times faster.

between surfaces at nano-scale contact (NSC) i.e., 0.1-0.4nm. To evaluate NSC

specific fluorescence molecules, named donor and acceptor. The F\""orster radius
(R0) of the FRET pair indicates the distance detection range (0.5R0-2R0) of the

we propose a new FRET pair: 7-Amino-4-methyl-cumarin (C120) and
5(6)-Carboxy-2',7'-dichlor-fluorescein (CDCF) with high quantum yield (QY,
QYC120=0.91 and QYCDCF=0.64) and a distance range of 0.6-2.2nm (0.1 mM)
specifically developed to measure NSC between soft surfaces. For this,
polymeric thin films were bonded using different loads, from 1.5 to 150 bar, to
create different degrees of NSC, analyzed by FRET spectroscopy, and later
pulled apart to measure their interfacial separation energy (adhesion force).
Our experiments showed that NSC increases with the applied pressure in the
bonded thin films, leading to higher FRET intensity and adhesion
force/separation energy. Thus, we have validated a new FRET pair, suitable to
measure the degree of NSC between surfaces and establish a linear relationship
between FRET and adhesion force; which can be of interest for any type of study
with soft materials interfaces that include NSC and its influence on adhesion,
as sealants, adhesives or sensors.

fully decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning problem and propose a
novel multi-agent congestion cost minimization (MACCM) algorithm. Our MACCM
algorithm uses linear function approximations of transition probabilities and
the global cost function. In the absence of a central controller and to
preserve privacy, agents communicate the cost function parameters to their
neighbors via a time-varying communication network. Moreover, each agent
maintains its estimate of the global state-action value, which is updated via a
multi-agent extended value iteration (MAEVI) sub-routine. We show that our
MACCM algorithm achieves a sub-linear regret. The proof requires the
convergence of cost function parameters, the MAEVI algorithm, and analysis of
the regret bounds induced by the MAEVI triggering condition for each agent. We
implement our algorithm on a two node network with multiple links to validate
it. We first identify the optimal policy, the optimal number of agents going to
the goal node in each period. We observe that the average regret is close to
zero for 2 and 3 agents. The optimal policy captures the trade-off between the
minimum cost of staying at a node and the congestion cost of going to the goal
node. Our work is a generalization of learning the stochastic shortest path

their actions, yielding a psychological language resource for Mental Health
Analysis (MHA) of online users. The success of Computational Intelligence
Techniques (CIT) for inferring mental illness from such social media resources
points to NLP as a lens for causal analysis and perception mining. However, we
argue that more consequential and explainable research is required for optimal
impact on clinical psychology practice and personalized mental healthcare. To
bridge this gap, we posit two significant dimensions: (1) Causal analysis to
illustrate a cause and effect relationship in the user generated text; (2)
Perception mining to infer psychological perspectives of social effects on
online users intentions. Within the scope of Natural Language Processing (NLP),
we further explore critical areas of inquiry associated with these two
dimensions, specifically through recent advancements in discourse analysis.
This position paper guides the community to explore solutions in this space and
advance the state of practice in developing conversational agents for inferring
mental health from social media. We advocate for a more explainable approach
toward modeling computational psychology problems through the lens of language
as we observe an increased number of research contributions in dataset and
problem formulation for causal relation extraction and perception enhancements
while inferring mental states.

multiple spatially configurable near-eye display modules and full 3D tracking

easily develop and prototype novel peripheral vision interaction and

several possible applications for spatial awareness, balance, interaction,

been missing. The present study provides a systematic comparison between Oslo
data and six global level density models for 42 nuclei for which $s$-wave
resonance spacings are also available. We apply a coherent normalization
procedure to the Oslo data for each of the six different models, all being
treated on the same footing.
  Our quantitative analysis shows that the constant-temperature model presents
the best global description of the Oslo data, closely followed by the
mean-field plus combinatorial model and Hartree-Fock plus statistical model.
Their accuracies are quite similar, so that it remains difficult to clearly
favour one of these models. When considering energies above the threshold where
the experimental level scheme is complete, all the six models are shown to lead
to rather similar accuracies with respect to Oslo data.
  The recently proposed shape method can, in principle, improve the situation
since it provides an absolute estimate of the excitation-energy dependence of
the measured level densities. We show for the specific case of $^{112}$Cd that
the shape method could exclude the Hartree-Fock plus statistical model. Such an
analysis remains to be performed for the bulk of data for which the shape
method can be applied to the Oslo measurements before drawing conclusions on

be reduced by spatially shaping the fundamental beam to generate high-order

measuring both the intensity profile and wavefront for each harmonic in a

to the mass and energy transfer from the lower atmosphere to the corona;
consequently, this region has been studied intensely with ultraviolet (UV) and
extreme ultraviolet observations. A major result of these studies is that the
amount of plasma at temperatures smaller than 100 000 K, is far too large to be
compatible with the standard theory of thermal conductivity. However, it is not
clear whether the disagreement lies with a problem in the observations or in
the theory. We address this issue by analysing high-spatial and temporal
resolution EUV observations from an X1.6-class flare taken with the Interface
Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Solar Dynamic
Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA). These data allow us to
isolate the emission of flare loops from that of surrounding structures. We
compare the Emission Measures (EMs) derived from the C II 1334.525Ang., Si IV
1402.770Ang transition region spectral lines, the Fe XXI 1354.066Ang flare line
and the AIA 171Ang coronal images. We find that the EM ratios are incompatible
with a standard conduction-dominated transition region model. Furthermore, the
large increases in the EM magnitudes due to flare heating make it highly
unlikely that the disagreement between data and theory is due to observational
uncertainties in the source of the emission. We conclude that the standard
Spitzer Harm thermal conductivity must be invalid for, at least, flare loops.
We discuss the possibility that turbulent suppression of thermal conduction can

discrete real eigenvalues. The distributional trace of the time evolution
operator has singularities at the periods of induced Killing flow on the

cellular receptor-ligand system used to biochemically convey magnetic-field
changes. Measurable physiological quantities, such as the number of receptors
and fluctuations in ligand concentration, are shown to reflect the introduced
Wigner-Yanase measure of singlet-triplet coherence. We arrive at a
quantum-biological uncertainty relation, connecting the product of a biological
resource and a biological figure of merit with the Wigner-Yanase coherence. Our

enhance the photocatalytic activity, while increase in concentration and size
of the iron oxides can hinder it. Previously, TiO2/Fe2O3 composites have been
studied using DFT methods and explained a photo electron transfer from TiO2 to
Fe2O3. Nevertheless, a systematic study by increasing the size and coverage
concentration of Fe2O3 clusters on the anatase surface can give more insights
into observed photocatalytic activity. In this scenario, keeping this as a
guideline, we have simulated adsorption of Fe2O3 clusters at the anatase TiO2
(101) surface. We investigated the structural, electronic and magnetic
properties to understand the photocatalytic system. Adsorption of the clusters
at the surface is exothermic and generates impurity states in the band gap
which narrows the band gap. Notable charge transfer is attributed to a
formation of heterojunction between TiO2 and Fe2O3 cluster. These findings
indicate TiO2 to be a better photocatalyst with hematite clusters at low
coverage. We also introduced oxygen vacancy in the heterostructure to study the
possibility of altering the photocatalytic properties. We find that oxygen
vacancy further alters the electronic properties, and also locally affects the
magnetic properties. The results suggest that introduction of oxygen vacancy
can be a promising routine to modify the photocatalytic performance of TiO2.

  superchiral light",,,,,"physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sensitivity to molecular chirality is crucial for many fields, from biology
and chemistry to the pharmaceutical industry. By generating superchiral light,
nanophotonics has brought innovative solutions to reduce the detection volume
and increase sensitivity at the cost of a non-selectivity of light chirality or
a strong contribution to the background. Here, we theoretically propose an
achiral plasmonic resonator, based on a rectangular nanoslit in a thin gold
layer behaving as a magnetic dipole, to generate a tunable nanosource of purely
superchiral light. This nanosource is free of any background, and the sign of
its chirality is externally tunable in wavelength and polarization. These
properties result from the coupling between the incident wave and the magnetic
dipolar character of our nano-antenna. Thus, our results propose a platform
with deep subwavelength detection volumes for chiral molecules in particular,
in the visible, and a roadmap for optimizing the signal-to-noise ratios in
circular dichroism measurements to reach single-molecule sensitivity.

incomplete multi-view clustering (IMvC). Namely, i) instance commonality refers
to that within-cluster instances should share a common pattern, and ii) view
versatility refers to that cross-view samples should own view-specific
patterns. To this end, we design a novel dual-stream model which employs a dual
attention layer and a dual contrastive learning loss to learn view-specific
prototypes and model the sample-prototype relationship. When the view is
missed, our model performs data recovery using the prototypes in the missing
view and the sample-prototype relationship inherited from the observed view.
Thanks to our dual-stream model, both cluster- and view-specific information
could be captured, and thus the instance commonality and view versatility could
be preserved to facilitate IMvC. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method on six challenging benchmarks compared with 11
approaches. The code will be released.

urged to hold themselves accountable for the carbon emissions of the AI models

tackling AI environmental sustainability, a field referred to as Green AI.
Despite the rapid growth of interest in the topic, a comprehensive overview of
Green AI research is to date still missing. To address this gap, in this paper,
we present a systematic review of the Green AI literature. From the analysis of
98 primary studies, different patterns emerge. The topic experienced a
considerable growth from 2020 onward. Most studies consider monitoring AI model
footprint, tuning hyperparameters to improve model sustainability, or
benchmarking models. A mix of position papers, observational studies, and
solution papers are present. Most papers focus on the training phase, are
algorithm-agnostic or study neural networks, and use image data. Laboratory
experiments are the most common research strategy. Reported Green AI energy
savings go up to 115%, with savings over 50% being rather common. Industrial
parties are involved in Green AI studies, albeit most target academic readers.
Green AI tool provisioning is scarce. As a conclusion, the Green AI research
field results to have reached a considerable level of maturity. Therefore, from
this review emerges that the time is suitable to adopt other Green AI research
strategies, and port the numerous promising academic results to industrial
practice.

particle to extract energy and escape to an observer at infinity. In this
paper, we considered the electromagnetic field in the rotating

accretion disc forms an electromagnetic field around compact objects. After
that, we briefly examine negative energy orbits and their significance in
energy extraction. The ergoregion is absent in a rotating JNW geometry, but we
show that the effective ergoregion is there. The change in a negative energy
orbit concerning the magnetic field (B), spin parameter (a), and electric

empirical Bayes factor is closely related to the widely applicable information
criterion. We develop test-based empirical Bayes factors for several standard
tests and propose an extension to multiple testing closely related to the
optimal discovery procedure. For non-parametric tests the empirical Bayes
factor is approximately 10 times the P-value. We propose interpreting the
strength of Bayes factors on a logarithmic scale with base 3.73, reflecting the

larger than $0.6_{-0.15}^{+0.05}$. The unresolved multiplicity fractions are
estimated applying a flexible mixture model to the observed Gaia
colour-magnitude diagrams of the open clusters. Then we use custom Gaia
simulations to account for the resolved systems and derive the total
multiplicity fractions. The studied open clusters have ages between 6.6 Myr and
3.0 Gyr and total high-mass-ratio multiplicity fractions between 6% and 80%,
with a median of 18%. The multiplicity fractions increase with the mass of the
primary star, as expected. The average multiplicity fraction per cluster
displays an overall decreasing trend with the open cluster age up to ages about
100 Myr, above which the trend increases. Our simulations show that most of
this trend is caused by complex selection effects (introduced by the mass
dependence of the multiplicity fraction and the magnitude limit of our sample).
Furthermore, the multiplicity fraction is not significantly correlated with the
clusters' position in the Galaxy. The spread in multiplicity fraction decreases
significantly with the number of cluster members (used as a proxy for cluster
mass). We also find that the multiplicity fraction decreases with metallicity,

isotope, can be expressed as the sum of a field shift and a mass shift, similar
to the atomic case. We show that a linear relation holds between atomic and
molecular isotopes shifts, thus extending the King-plot analysis to molecular
isotope shifts. Optical isotope shifts in YbF and ZrO and infrared isotope
shifts in SnH are analyzed with a molecular King-plot approach, utilizing
Yb$^{+}$ and Zr$^{+}$ ionic isotope shifts and charge radii of Sn obtained with
non-optical methods. The changes in the mean-squared nuclear charge radii
$\delta \langle r^2 \rangle$ of $^{170-174,176}$Yb and $^{90-92,94,96}$Zr
extracted from the molecular transitions are found to be in excellent agreement
with the values from the spectroscopy of Yb$^{+}$ and Zr$^{+}$, respectively.
On the contrary, in the case of the vibrational-rotational transition in SnH,
no sensitivity to the nuclear volume could be deduced within the experimental
resolution, which makes it unsuitable for the extraction of nuclear charge
radii but provides insights into the molecular electronic wave function not
accessible via other methods. The new opportunities offered by the molecular

used to estimate class hierarchical structures. If we have a predefined class

whether the metric learning model learned semantic distances that match our

hierarchical inference performance by inspecting learned class representatives

and the metric learning performance by considering predefined hierarchical
structures. Furthermore, we investigate how the considered measures are
affected by various models and training options. When our proposed ProxyDR
model is trained without using predefined hierarchical structures, the
hierarchical inference performance is significantly better than that of the
popular NormFace model. Additionally, our model enhances some
hierarchy-informed performance measures under the same training options. We
also found that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with random weights
correspond to the predefined hierarchies better than random chance.

MIMO) is one of the most promising technologies for the fifth generation and
beyond wireless communication system. However, a large number of antennas incur
high power consumption and hardware costs, and high-frequency communications
place a heavy burden on the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at the base
station (BS). Furthermore, it is too costly to equipping each antenna with a
high-precision ADC in a large antenna array system. It is promising to adopt
low-resolution ADCs to address this problem. In this paper, we investigate the
cascaded channel estimation for a mmWave massive MIMO system aided by a
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with the BS equipped with few-bit
ADCs. Due to the low-rank property of the cascaded channel, the estimation of
the cascaded channel can be formulated as a low-rank matrix completion problem.
We introduce a Bayesian optimal estimation framework for estimating the
user-RIS-BS cascaded channel to tackle with the information loss caused by
quantization. To implement the estimator and achieve the matrix completion, we
use efficient bilinear generalized approximate message passing (BiG-AMP)
algorithm. Extensive simulation results verify that our proposed method can
accurately estimate the cascaded channel for the RIS-aided mmWave massive MIMO

(opacity, remaining time, initial position in the cell) on a parameter grid,
the escape distribution is precomputed offline and only the quantiles are
retained. The online computation samples only from this quantized version by
choosing a parameter triplet on the grid (close to actual particle's

quantiles for that parameter. We first check numerically that the escape laws
depend smoothly on the parameters and then implement the procedure on a

as diffusion along reaction coordinates (RCs). If the RCs are optimally
selected, the diffusive model allows one to compute important properties of the
dynamics exactly. The committor is a primary example of an optimal RC.
Recently, additive eigenvectors (addevs) have been introduced in order to
extend the formalism to non-equilibrium dynamics. An addev describes a
sub-ensemble of trajectories of a stochastic process together with an optimal
RC. The sub-ensemble is conditioned to have a single RC optimal for both the
forward and time-reversed non-equilibrium dynamics of the sub-ensemble. Here we
consider stationary addevs and obtain the following results. We show that the
forward and time-reversed committors are functions of the addev, meaning a
diffusive model along an addev RC can be used to compute important properties
of non-equilibrium dynamics exactly. The rates of the conditioned stochastic
process, describing an addev sub-ensemble, can be computed ``on the fly'', thus
allowing efficient sampling schemes. We obtain two families of addev solutions
for diffusion. The first is described by equations of classical mechanics,
while the second can be approximated by quantum mechanical equations. We show
how the potential can be introduced into the formalism self-consistently. The
developments are illustrated on simple examples. The two addev families provide
stochastic models together with optimal RCs and new sampling schemes for
classical and quantum mechanical systems. It suggests that the conditioned
stochastic processes defined by addevs are suitable for description of dynamics

the sample size of such systems is key to minimising statistical uncertainties

solve the multiclass Traffic Assignment Problem (TAP) in mixed traffic of CAVs
and HDVs. Few studies have tried to solve this problem; however, most used
analytical solutions, which are challenging to implement in real and large
networks (especially in dynamic cases). Also, studies in implementing
simulation-based methods have not considered all of CAVs' potential
capabilities. On the other hand, several different (conflicting) assumptions
are made about the CAV's route choice behavior in these studies. So, providing
a tool that can solve the multiclass TAP of mixed traffic under different
assumptions can help researchers to understand the impacts of CAVs better. To
fill these gaps, this study provides an open-source solution framework of the
multiclass simulation-based traffic assignment problem for mixed traffic of
CAVs and HDVs. This model assumes that CAVs follow system optimal principles
with rerouting capability, while HDVs follow user equilibrium principles.
Moreover, this model can capture the impacts of CAVs on road capacity by
considering distinct driving behavioral models in both micro and meso scales
traffic simulation. This proposed model is tested in two case studies which
shows that as the penetration rate of CAVs increases, the total travel time of
all vehicles decreases.

percent 5-year overall survival. Radiation therapy (RT) is an effective
treatment for Locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). The current clinical
RT workflow is lengthy and involves separate image acquisition for diagnostic
CT (dCT) and planning CT (pCT). Studies have shown a reduction in mortality
rate from expeditious radiotherapy treatment. dCT and pCT are acquired
separately because of the differences in the image acquisition setup and
patient body. We are presenting deepPERFECT: deep learning-based model to adapt
the shape of the patient body on dCT to the treatment delivery setup. Our
method expedites the treatment course by allowing the design of the initial RT
planning before the pCT acquisition. Thus, the physicians can evaluate the
potential RT prognosis ahead of time, verify the plan on the treatment day-one
CT and apply any online adaptation if needed. We used the data from 25
pancreatic cancer patients. The model was trained on 15 cases and tested on the
remaining ten cases. We evaluated the performance of four different
deep-learning architectures for this task. The synthesized CT (sCT) and regions
of interest (ROIs) were compared with ground truth (pCT) using Dice similarity
coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff distance (HD). We found that the
three-dimensional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model trained on large
patches has the best performance. The average DSC and HD for body contours were
0.93, and 4.6 mm. We found no statistically significant difference between the
synthesized CT plans and the ground truth. We showed that employing deepPERFECT
shortens the current lengthy clinical workflow by at least one week and
improves the effectiveness of treatment and the quality of life of pancreatic
cancer patients.

  that leverages pointers over objects","Under review in the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ)",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Planning as heuristic search is one of the most successful approaches to
classical planning but unfortunately, it does not extend trivially to
Generalized Planning (GP). GP aims to compute algorithmic solutions that are
valid for a set of classical planning instances from a given domain, even if
these instances differ in the number of objects, the number of state variables,
their domain size, or their initial and goal configuration. The generalization
requirements of GP make it impractical to perform the state-space search that
is usually implemented by heuristic planners. This paper adapts the planning as
heuristic search paradigm to the generalization requirements of GP, and
presents the first native heuristic search approach to GP. First, the paper
introduces a new pointer-based solution space for GP that is independent of the
number of classical planning instances in a GP problem and the size of those
instances (i.e. the number of objects, state variables and their domain sizes).
Second, the paper defines a set of evaluation and heuristic functions for
guiding a combinatorial search in our new GP solution space. The computation of
these evaluation and heuristic functions does not require grounding states or
actions in advance. Therefore our GP as heuristic search approach can handle
large sets of state variables with large numerical domains, e.g.~integers.
Lastly, the paper defines an upgraded version of our novel algorithm for GP
called Best-First Generalized Planning (BFGP), that implements a best-first
search in our pointer-based solution space, and that is guided by our
evaluation/heuristic functions for GP.

on observational studies. Under the typical unconfoundness assumption,
augmented inverse probability weighting (AIPW) has been popular for estimating
the average causal effect (ACE) due to its double robustness in the sense it
relies on either the propensity score model or the outcome mean model to be
correctly specified. To ensure the key assumption holds, the effort is often
made to collect a sufficiently rich set of pretreatment variables, rendering
variable selection imperative. It is well known that variable selection for the
propensity score targeted for accurate prediction may produce a variable ACE
estimator by including the instrument variables. Thus, many recent works
recommend selecting all outcome predictors for both confounding control and
efficient estimation. This article shows that the AIPW estimator with variable
selection targeted for efficient estimation may lose the desirable double
robustness property. Instead, we propose controlling the propensity score model
for any covariate that is a predictor of either the treatment or the outcome or
both, which preserves the double robustness of the AIPW estimator. Using this
principle, we propose a two-stage procedure with penalization for variable
selection and the AIPW estimator for estimation. We show the proposed procedure
benefits from the desirable double robustness property. We evaluate the
finite-sample performance of the AIPW estimator with various variable selection
criteria through simulation and an application.

object detection and semantic segmentation? We evaluate different
vision-language models with multiple datasets across a set of concepts and find
(i) all models evaluated show distinct performance differences based on the
perceived gender of the person co-occurring with a given concept in the image

model calibration (i.e. the relationship between accuracy and confidence) also
differs distinctly by perceived gender, even when evaluating on similar

existing gender biases in word embeddings from language models. These findings
suggest that, while language greatly expands the capability of vision tasks, it
can also contribute to social biases in zero-shot vision settings. Furthermore,
biases can further propagate when foundational models like CLIP are used by
other models to enable zero-shot capabilities.

under the auspices of Jules Janssen. For his part, Henri Deslandres initiated
imaging spectroscopy in 1892 at Paris observatory. He invented, concurrently
with George Hale in Kenwood (USA) but quite independently, the
spectroheliograph designed for monochromatic imagery of the solar atmosphere.
Deslandres developed two kinds of spectrographs: the ''spectroh{\'e}liographe
des formes'', i.e. the narrow bandpass instrument to reveal chromospheric
structures (such as filaments, prominences, plages and active regions); and the
''spectroh{\'e}liographe des vitesses'', i.e. the section spectroheliograph to
record line profiles of cross sections of the Sun with a 20''-30'' spatial
step. This second apparatus was intended to measure the velocities (more
exactly the Dopplershifts) of dynamic features. Deslandres moved to Meudon in
1898 with his instruments and tested various combinations, in order to improve
the spectral and spatial resolutions, leading to the final large quadruple
spectroheliograph in 1908. CaII K systematic observations started at this date
and were followed in 1909 by H$\alpha$. The service was organized by Lucien
d'Azambuja and continues today. Optical and mechanical parts were revisited in
1989 and the digital technology was introduced in 2002. Full line profiles are
registered for all pixels of the Sun since 2018, so that the instrument
produces now data-cubes. The collection is one of the longest available (more
than 100 000 observations). It contains sporadic images from 1893 to 1907
(during the development phase) and systematic observations along 10 solar
cycles since 1908, in H$\alpha$ and CaII K lines. This paper summarizes 130
years of observations, instrumental research and technical advances.

multi-modal knowledge learned from large-scale image-text data pairs, thus

model, we revisit temporal modeling in the context of image-to-video knowledge
transferring, which is the key point for extending image-text pretrained models
to the video domain. We find that current temporal modeling mechanisms are
tailored to either high-level semantic-dominant tasks (e.g., retrieval) or
low-level visual pattern-dominant tasks (e.g., recognition), and fail to work
on the two cases simultaneously. The key difficulty lies in modeling temporal
dependency while taking advantage of both high-level and low-level knowledge in

Network (STAN) -- a simple and effective temporal modeling mechanism extending
CLIP model to diverse video tasks. Specifically, to realize both low-level and

decomposed spatial-temporal modules that enable multi-level CLIP features to be
spatial-temporally contextualized. We evaluate our method on two representative

including in the cytoskeleton, where reorganization of actin filaments allows
the cell to move and divide. Most methods for simulating semiflexible
inextensible fibers/polymers are based on discrete (bead-link or blob-link)
models, which become prohibitively expensive in the slender limit when
hydrodynamics is accounted for. In this paper, we develop a novel
coarse-grained approach for simulating fluctuating slender filaments with
hydrodynamic interactions. Our approach is tailored to relatively stiff fibers
whose persistence length is comparable to or larger than their length, and is
based on three major contributions. First, we discretize the filament
centerline using a coarse non-uniform Chebyshev grid, on which we formulate a
discrete constrained Gibbs-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution and overdamped
Langevin equation. Second, we define the hydrodynamic mobility at each point on
the filament as an integral of the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa kernel along the
centerline, and apply a spectrally-accurate quadrature to accurately resolve
the hydrodynamics. Third, we propose a novel midpoint temporal integrator which
can correctly capture the Ito drift terms that arise in the overdamped Langevin
equation. We verify that the equilibrium distribution for the Chebyshev grid is
a good approximation of the blob-link one, and that our temporal integrator
samples the equilibrium distribution for sufficiently small time steps. We also
study the dynamics of relaxation of an initially straight filament, and find
that as few as 12 Chebyshev nodes provides a good approximation to the dynamics
while allowing a time step size two orders of magnitude larger than a resolved
blob-link simulation. We conclude by studying how bending fluctuations aid the
process of bundling in cross-linked networks of semiflexible fibers.

random $d$-dimensional subspace of $R^n$. A classical question is how to
recover this planted vector given a random basis in this subspace. A recent
result by [ZSWB21] showed that the Lattice basis reduction algorithm can
recover the planted vector when $n\geq d+1$. Although the algorithm is not
expected to tolerate inverse polynomial amount of noise, it is surprising
because it was previously shown that recovery cannot be achieved by low degree
polynomials when $n\ll \rho^2 d^{2}$ [MW21]. A natural question is whether we
can derive an Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound matching the previous low
degree lower bound in [MW21]. This will
  - imply that the SQ lower bound can be surpassed by lattice based algorithms;
  - predict the computational hardness when the planted vector is perturbed by
inverse polynomial amount of noise. In this paper, we prove such an SQ lower
bound. In particular, we show that super-polynomial number of VSTAT queries is
needed to solve the easier statistical testing problem when $n\ll \rho^2 d^{2}$

among multiple social, technical, and sociotechnical systems). Conclusion: The
academic literature on SSE is surprisingly non-empirical. More empirical
evaluations of specific sustainability interventions are needed. The
sustainability of software development products and processes should be
conceptualized as multisystemic and stratified, and assessed accordingly.

  Shear","submitted to JNNFM",,,,"math.NA cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The method of harmonic balance (HB) is a spectrally accurate method used to
obtain periodic steady state solutions to dynamical systems subjected to
periodic perturbations. We adapt HB to solve for the stress response of the
Giesekus model under large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) deformation. HB
transforms the system of differential equations to a set of nonlinear algebraic
equations in the Fourier coefficients. Convergence studies find that the
difference between the HB and true solutions decays exponentially with the
number of harmonics ($H$) included in the ansatz as $e^{-m H}$. The decay
coefficient $m$ decreases with increasing strain amplitude, and exhibits a ""U""
shaped dependence on applied frequency. The computational cost of HB increases
slightly faster than linearly with $H$. The net result of rapid convergence and
modest increase in computational cost with increasing $H$ implies that HB
outperforms the conventional method of using numerical integration to solve
differential constitutive equations under oscillatory shear. Numerical
experiments find that HB is simultaneously about three orders of magnitude
cheaper, and several orders of magnitude more accurate than numerical
integration. Thus, it offers a compelling value proposition for parameter
estimation or model selection.

in the case of algebraic cellular automata, that is, when the state set has an
algebraic structure and the automaton acts as a morphism. The most studied
cases include finite fields, finite commutative rings and finite commutative
groups. In this paper, we provide methods to generalize these results to the
broader case of group cellular automata, that is, the case where the state set
is a finite (possibly non-commutative) finite group. The configuration space is
not even necessarily the full shift but a subshift -- called a group shift --
that is a subgroup of the full shift on Z^d, for any number d of dimensions. We
show, in particular, that injectivity, surjectivity, equicontinuity,
sensitivity and nilpotency are decidable for group cellular automata, and
non-transitivity is semi-decidable. Injectivity always implies surjectivity,
and jointly periodic points are dense in the limit set. The Moore direction of
the Garden-of-Eden theorem holds for all group cellular automata, while the
Myhill direction fails in some cases. The proofs are based on effective
projection operations on group shifts that are, in particular, applied on the
set of valid space-time diagrams of group cellular automata. This allows one to
effectively construct the traces and the limit sets of group cellular automata.

for maximizing the achievable sum-rate of the multi-user communications under
an SNR constraint for target detection or a CRB constraint for parameter

data, however spatial resolution of their spectral bands limited to 10 m, 20 m,
and 60 m ground sampling distance remains insufficient in many cases. This
problem can be addressed with super-resolution, aimed at reconstructing a
high-resolution image from a low-resolution observation. For Sentinel-2,
spectral information fusion allows for enhancing the 20 m and 60 m bands to the
10 m resolution. Also, there were attempts to combine multitemporal stacks of
individual Sentinel-2 bands, however these two approaches have not been
combined so far. In this paper, we introduce DeepSent -- a new deep network for
super-resolving multitemporal series of multispectral Sentinel-2 images. It is
underpinned with information fusion performed simultaneously in the spectral
and temporal dimensions to generate an enlarged multispectral image. In our
extensive experimental study, we demonstrate that our solution outperforms
other state-of-the-art techniques that realize either multitemporal or
multispectral data fusion. Furthermore, we show that the advantage of DeepSent
results from how these two fusion types are combined in a single architecture,
which is superior to performing such fusion in a sequential manner.
Importantly, we have applied our method to super-resolve real-world Sentinel-2
images, enhancing the spatial resolution of all the spectral bands to 3.3 m
nominal ground sampling distance, and we compare the outcome with very
high-resolution WorldView-2 images. We will publish our implementation upon
paper acceptance, and we expect it will increase the possibilities of
exploiting super-resolved Sentinel-2 images in real-life applications.

Malware authors are constantly evolving in their attack strategies and

performance model first, explores and implements an improvement model from the
baseline model, and finally it evaluates the performance of the final model.
The baseline model initially achieves 98% accurate rate but after increasing
the depth of the CNN model, its accuracy reaches 99.183 which outperforms most
of the CNN models in the literature. Finally, to further solidify the
effectiveness of this CNN model, we use the improved model to make predictions

foundation of many verification paradigms. The safety-liveness classification
of boolean properties characterizes whether a given property can be falsified
by observing a finite prefix of an infinite computation trace (always for

properties assign not truth values, but quantitative values to infinite traces
(e.g., a cost, or the distance to a boolean property). We introduce
quantitative safety and liveness, and we prove that our definitions induce
conservative quantitative generalizations of both (1)~the safety-progress
hierarchy of boolean properties and (2)~the safety-liveness decomposition of
boolean properties. In particular, we show that every quantitative property can
be written as the pointwise minimum of a quantitative safety property and a
quantitative liveness property. Consequently, like boolean properties, also
quantitative properties can be $\min$-decomposed into safety and liveness
parts, or alternatively, $\max$-decomposed into co-safety and co-liveness
parts. Moreover, quantitative properties can be approximated naturally. We
prove that every quantitative property that has both safe and co-safe
approximations can be monitored arbitrarily precisely by a monitor that uses
only a finite number of states.

The over-increasing Winograd parameters not only exacerbate training complexity

element-wise products in the Winograd domain. We attempt to reduce trainable
parameters by introducing a low-rank Winograd transformation, a novel training
paradigm that decouples the original large tensor into two less

reduction. Built upon our low-rank Winograd transformation, we take one step
ahead by proposing a low-rank oriented sparse granularity that measures
column-wise parameter importance. By simply involving the non-zero columns in
the element-wise product, our sparse granularity is empowered with the ability
to produce a very regular sparse pattern to acquire effectual Winograd
speedups. To better understand the efficacy of our method, we perform extensive
experiments on 3D CNNs. Results manifest that our low-rank Winograd
transformation well outperforms the vanilla Winograd transformation. We also

recent line of work to derive such exploratory options builds upon the
eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian. Importantly, until now these methods

The most common synthe-sis approaches use on-axis sputter geometries. However,
in some scenarios, on-axis sputtering is not feasible. During ionized physical
vapor deposition (PVD), in contrast to conventional PVD, the film-forming
species can be accelerated onto the growing film using substrate-bias
potentials. This increas-es the ad-atom mobility, but also deflects the
trajectory of ions towards the substrate increasing the texture of the growing
film. However, potential gas-ion incorporation in the films limits the
feasibility of such approaches for the deposition of defect-sensitive
materials. In this work, we report on the oblique-angle deposition of highly
c-axis oriented AlN (0002) films, enabled by reactive metal-ion syn-chronized
HiPIMS. The effect of critical deposition parameters, such as the magnetic
configuration, ion kinetic energies and substrate biasing are investigated. The
films deposited using HiPIMS show a more pronounced texture and orientation
compared to DCMS films. We find that combining the HiPIMS dep-ositions with a
moderate substrate bias of -30 V is sufficient to improve the crystalline
quality and tex-ture of the films significantly. To reduce process-gas
incorporation, and the formation of point defects, the negative substrate-bias
potential is synchronized to the Al-rich fraction of each HiPIMS pulse. This
leads to reduced Ar-Ion incorporation and improves the structural properties.
The films also show uni-form polarization of the grains making this synthesis
route suitable for piezoelectric applications. While the compressive stress in
the films is still high, the results demonstrate, that synchronized HiPIMS can
yield promising results for the synthesis under oblique-angle deposition
conditions - even with low substrate-bias potentials.

sets can exploit information on moments as well as confidence sets. Typically,
reformulation approaches using duality theory need to make strong assumptions
on the structure of the underlying constraints, such as convexity in the
decisions or concavity in the uncertainty. In contrast, here we present a very
general duality-based reformulation approach for distributionally robust
problems that are allowed to depend on elementary functions, which renders the
problem nonlinear and nonconvex. In order to be able to reformulate the
semiinfinite constraints nevertheless, a safe approximation is presented that
is realized by a discretized counterpart. Its reformulation leads to a
mixed-integer positive semidefinite problem that yields sufficient conditions
for distributional robustness of the original problem. For specific models with
uncertainties that are only one-dimensional, it is proven that with
increasingly fine discretizations, the discretized reformulation converges to
the robust counterpart of the original distributionally robust problem. The
approach is made concrete for a one-dimensional robust chance-constrained
problem, where the discretized counterpart results in a mixed-integer linear
problem. We study a challenging, fundamental task in particle separation that
appears in material design. Computational results for a realistic setting show
that the safe approximation yields robust solutions of high-quality within

as a use case to test our proposed method. From our analysis, the network
effectively predicts high peaks in discharge measurements at watershed outlets
with up to 4.1x speedup and increased prediction performance of up to 93\%. Our
approach achieved a 12.6x overall speedup and increased the mean prediction

model of complex neuron-astrocyte network and employ it to explore the roles of
astrocyte in regulating the synchronization behaviors of networked neurons. It
is found that a fraction of neurons on the network can be synchronized as a

during the course of network evolution, the cluster is switching between the
synchrony and asynchrony states intermittently, henceforth the phenomenon of

due to the interplay between the neural network and the astrocyte. The
breathing phenomenon is demonstrated in network models of different structures

high-resolution images of weakly-attenuating materials that would otherwise be
indistinguishable in conventional attenuation-based imaging. The experimental
setup of SB-PCXI requires only a sufficiently coherent source and spatially
random mask, positioned between the source and detector. The technique can
extract sample information at length scales smaller than the imaging system's
spatial resolution; this enables multimodal signal reconstruction. ``Multimodal
Intrinsic Speckle-Tracking'' (MIST) is a rapid and deterministic formalism
derived from the paraxial-optics form of the Fokker-Planck equation. MIST
simultaneously extracts attenuation, refraction, and small-angle scattering
(diffusive-dark-field) signals from a sample and is more computationally
efficient compared to alternative speckle-tracking approaches. Hitherto,
variants of MIST have assumed the diffusive-dark-field signal to be spatially
slowly varying. Although successful, these approaches have been unable to
well-describe unresolved sample microstructure whose statistical form is not
spatially slowly varying. Here, we extend the MIST formalism such that there is
no such restriction, in terms of a sample's rotationally-isotropic
diffusive-dark-field signal. We reconstruct multimodal signals of two samples,
each with distinct X-ray attenuation and scattering properties. The
reconstructed diffusive-dark-field signals have superior image quality compared
to our previous approaches which assume the diffusive-dark-field to be a slowly
varying function of transverse position. Our generalisation may assist
increased adoption of SB-PCXI in applications such as engineering and
biomedical disciplines, forestry, and palaeontology, and is anticipated to aid
the development of speckle-based diffusive-dark-field tensor tomography.

  Organisations","313 pages, PhD Thesis",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Information security governance (ISG) is a relatively new and
under-researched topic. A review of literature shows the lack of an ISG
framework or model that can help the implementation of ISG. This research aims
to introduce an empirically grounded ISG process model as a practical reference
to facilitate the implementation of ISG in organisations.
  This research has adopted an exploratory research approach where a conceptual
ISG process model was proposed based on synthesis of extant literature and
detailed review of relevant frameworks and models. The conceptual ISG process
model was subsequently refined based on empirical data gathered from 3 case
study organisations. The refined ISG process model was finally validated in 6
expert interviews.
  This research has developed an empirically grounded ISG process model
identifying stakeholder groups and explaining how core ISG processes and
sub-processes interact. Specifically, the research contributes by: (1)
developing ISG process theory, as ISG is a series of events occurring within an
organisational context; and (2) developing an information-processing
perspective on ISG, as the process model identifies the information and
communication flows, and the relationships among stakeholder groups. In
addition, the research has: (3) empirically examined and validated the ISG
process model based on how ISG is practised in real-world organisations; (4)
examined corporate governance theories to provide additional perspectives to
ensure that the ISG process model is aligned with corporate governance
objectives; (5) identified additional factors that influence the implementation
of ISG requiring further research; and finally (6) expanded existing seminal
research by introducing an empirically grounded ISG process model that has been
developed based on synthesis of cumulative knowledge from previous research and
validated with empirical data.

  elements","10 pages and 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Growing soft materials which follow a 3D path in space are critical to
applications such as search and rescue and minimally invasive surgery. Here, we
present a concept for a single-input growing multi-stable soft material, based
on a constrained straw-like structure. This class of materials are capable of
maneuvering and transforming their configuration by elongation while executing
multiple turns. This is achieved by sequenced actuation of bi-stable frusta
with predefined constraints. Internal viscous flow and variations in the
stability threshold of the individual cells enable sequencing and control of
the robot's movement so as to follow a desired 3D path as the structure grows.
We derive a theoretical description of the shape and dynamics resulting from a
particular set of constraints. To validate the model and demonstrate the
suggested concept, we present experiments of maneuvering in models of
residential and biological environments. In addition to performing complex 3D
maneuvers, the tubular structure of these robots may also be used as a conduit
to reach inaccessible regions, which is demonstrated experimentally.

end, we focus on a case study, in which nine different research groups
concurrently simulated the process of injecting CO2 into the subsurface. We
explore different data aggregation and interactive visualization approaches to
compare and analyze these nine simulations. In terms of data aggregation, one
key component is the choice of similarity metrics that define the relation
between the different simulations. We test different metrics and find that a
fine-tuned machine-learning based metric provides the best visualization
results. Based on that, we propose different visualization methods. For
overviewing the data, we use dimensionality reduction methods that allow us to
plot and compare the different simulations in a scatterplot. To show details
about the spatio-temporal data of each individual simulation, we employ a
space-time cube volume rendering. We use the resulting interactive, multi-view
visual analysis tool to explore the nine simulations and also to compare them
to data from experimental setups. Our main findings include new insights into
ranking of simulation results with respect to experimental data, and the
development of gravity fingers in simulations.

performance-proof purpose; classical ZDT test functions, which is a widespread
test suite that takes its name from its authors Zitzler, Deb, and Thiele, and
on IEEE Congress of Evolutionary Computation benchmark (CEC 2019) multi modal
multi objective functions. MOFDO results are compared to the latest variant of
multi objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO), non-dominated sorting
genetic algorithm third improvement (NSGA-III), and multi objective dragonfly
algorithm (MODA). The comparative study shows the superiority of MOFDO in most
cases and comparative results in other cases. Moreover, MOFDO is used for
optimizing real-world engineering problems (e.g., welded beam design problems).
It is observed that the proposed algorithm successfully provides a wide variety
of well-distributed feasible solutions, which enable the decision-makers to
have more applicable-comfort choices to consider.

investigated using machine learning and artificial neural network based tools

as well as its volatility and other complex relationships. To combine them,
hidden markov models (HMMs) have been utilized to anticipate the price of
stocks. We demonstrated the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) HMM method for
predicting stock prices for the next day based on previous data. An HMM is
trained by analyzing the fractional change in the stock price as well as the
intraday high and low values. It is then utilized to produce a MAP estimate
across all possible stock prices for the next day. The approach demonstrated in
our work is quite generalized and can be used to predict the stock price for
any company, given that the HMM is trained on the dataset of that company's
stocks dataset. We evaluated the accuracy of our models using some extensively
used accuracy metrics for regression problems and came up with a satisfactory
outcome.

tractable density. They transform a simple base distribution, such as a
Gaussian, through a sequence of invertible functions, which are referred to as
layers. These layers typically use neural networks to become very expressive.
Flows are ubiquitous in machine learning and have been applied to image
generation, text modeling, variational inference, approximating Boltzmann
distributions, and many other problems. Here, we present normflows, a Python
package for normalizing flows. It allows to build normalizing flow models from
a suite of base distributions, flow layers, and neural networks. The package is
implemented in the popular deep learning framework PyTorch, which simplifies
the integration of flows in larger machine learning models or pipelines. It
supports most of the common normalizing flow architectures, such as Real NVP,
Glow, Masked Autoregressive Flows, Neural Spline Flows, Residual Flows, and
many more. The package can be easily installed via pip and the code is publicly

distance to the support can be interpreted as a normality score, and its
approximation using 1-Lipschitz neural networks provides robustness bounds
against l2 adversarial attacks, an under-explored weakness of deep
learning-based OCC algorithms. As a result, OCSDF comes with a new metric,
certified AUROC, that can be computed at the same cost as any classical AUROC.
We show that OCSDF is competitive against concurrent methods on tabular and
image data while being way more robust to adversarial attacks, illustrating its
theoretical properties. Finally, as exploratory research perspectives, we
theoretically and empirically show how OCSDF connects OCC with image generation
and implicit neural surface parametrization. Our code is available at

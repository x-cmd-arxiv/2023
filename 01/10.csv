the high complexity of 3D environments and the diversity of possible human
behaviors within. We present LAMA, Locomotion-Action-MAnipulation, to
synthesize natural and plausible long term human movements in complex indoor
environments. The key motivation of LAMA is to build a unified framework to
encompass a series of motions commonly observable in our daily lives, including
locomotion, interactions with 3D scenes, and manipulations of 3D objects. LAMA
is based on a reinforcement learning framework coupled with a motion matching
algorithm to synthesize locomotion and scene interaction seamlessly under
common constraints and collision avoidance handling. LAMA also exploits a
motion editing framework via manifold learning to cover possible variations in
interaction and manipulation motions. We quantitatively and qualitatively
demonstrate that LAMA outperforms existing approaches in various challenging

  Prediction","Accepted by AAAI2023",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers have their own advantages
and both have been widely used for dense prediction in multi-task learning
(MTL). Most of the current studies on MTL solely rely on CNN or Transformer. In
this work, we present a novel MTL model by combining both merits of deformable
CNN and query-based Transformer for multi-task learning of dense prediction.
Our method, named DeMT, is based on a simple and effective encoder-decoder
architecture (i.e., deformable mixer encoder and task-aware transformer
decoder). First, the deformable mixer encoder contains two types of operators:
the channel-aware mixing operator leveraged to allow communication among
different channels ($i.e.,$ efficient channel location mixing), and the
spatial-aware deformable operator with deformable convolution applied to
efficiently sample more informative spatial locations (i.e., deformed
features). Second, the task-aware transformer decoder consists of the task
interaction block and task query block. The former is applied to capture task
interaction features via self-attention. The latter leverages the deformed
features and task-interacted features to generate the corresponding
task-specific feature through a query-based Transformer for corresponding task
predictions. Extensive experiments on two dense image prediction datasets,
NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context, demonstrate that our model uses fewer GFLOPs and
significantly outperforms current Transformer- and CNN-based competitive models
on a variety of metrics. The code are available at

liquid water on the surface of exoplanets. On terrestrial planets, volcanic
outgassing is a significant source of atmospheric and surface water and a major
contributor to the long-term evolution of the atmosphere. The rate of volcanism
depends on the interior evolution and on numerous feedback processes between
atmosphere and interior, which continuously shape atmospheric composition,
pressure, and temperature. We present the results of a comprehensive 1D model
of the coupled evolution of the interior and atmosphere of rocky exoplanets
that combines central feedback processes between these two reservoirs. We
carried out more than \num{280000} simulations over a wide range of mantle
redox states and volatile content, planetary masses, interior structures and
orbital distances in order to robustly assess the emergence, accumulation and
preservation of surface water on rocky planets. To establish a conservative
baseline of which types of planets can outgas and sustain water on their
surface, we focus here on stagnant-lid planets. We find that only a narrow
range of the mantle redox state around the iron-w\""ustite buffer allows the
formation of atmospheres that lead to long-term habitable conditions. At
oxidizing conditions similar to those of the Earth's mantle, most stagnant-lid
planets end up in a hothouse regime akin to Venus due to strong \ce{CO2}
outgassing. At more reducing conditions, the amount of outgassed greenhouse
gases is often too low to keep surface water from freezing. In addition,
Mercury-like planets with large metallic cores are able to sustain habitable
conditions at an extended range of orbital distances as a result of lower
volcanic activity.

has been used to show that hot Jupiters are more likely to be found around
exoplanet host-stars in high 6D phase space density, suggesting a more dynamic
formation environment for these planets. However, later work showed that this
initial result may be due to a bias in the age of hot Jupiters and the
kinematics of their host stars. We test the ability of the Mahalanobis distance
and density to differentiate more generally between star-forming regions with
different morphologies by applying it to static regions that are either
substructured or smooth and centrally concentrated. We find that the
Mahalanobis distance is unable to distinguish between different morphologies,
and that the initial conditions of the N-body simulations cannot be constrained
using only the Mahalanobis distance or density. Furthermore, we find that the
more dimensions in the phase space the less effective the Mahalanobis density
is at distinguishing between different initial conditions. We show that a
combination of the mean three-dimensional (x, y, z) Mahalanobis density and the
Q-parameter for a region can constrain its initial virial state. However this
is due to the discriminatory power of the Q-parameter and not from any extra
information imprinted in the Mahalanobis density. We therefore recommend
continued use of multiple diagnostics for determining the initial conditions of
star-forming regions, rather than relying on a single multi-dimensional metric.

solar flare coronal electron beams lose their energy in a thick target of gas
in the upper and middle chromosphere (log$_{10}$ column mass /[g cm$^{-2}$]

instabilities are expected to further inhibit propagation to low altitudes. We
show that recent numerical solutions of the time-dependent equations governing
the power-law electrons and background coronal plasma (Langmuir and
ion-acoustic) waves from Kontar et al. produce order-of-magnitude larger
heating rates than occur in the deep chromosphere through standard solar flare
electron beam power-law distributions. We demonstrate that the redistribution
of beam energy above $E \gtrsim 100$ keV in this theory results in a local
heating maximum that is similar to a radiative-hydrodynamic model with a large,

address this inequity. To this end, this paper presents the first thorough

relied heavily on mean-field analysis. A pivotal assumption for this framework
is that the servers are exchangeable. However, modern data-centers have data
locality constraints, where tasks of a particular type can only be routed to a
small subset of servers. An emerging line of research, therefore, considers
load balancing algorithms on bipartite graphs where vertices in the two
partitions represent the task types and servers, respectively, and an edge
represents the server's ability to process the corresponding task type. Due to
the lack of exchangeability in this model, the mean-field techniques
fundamentally break down. Recent progress has been made by considering graphs
with strong edge-expansion properties, i.e., where any two large subsets of
vertices are well-connected. However, data locality often leads to spatial
constraints, where edges are local. As a result, these bipartite graphs do not
have strong expansion properties.
  In this paper, we consider the power-of-$d$ choices algorithm and develop a
novel coupling-based approach to establish mean-field approximation for a large
class of graphs that includes spatial graphs. As a corollary, we also show
that, as the system size becomes large, the steady-state occupancy process for
arbitrary regular bipartite graphs with diverging degrees, is indistinguishable
from a fully flexible system on a complete bipartite graph. The method extends
the scope of mean-field analysis far beyond the classical full-flexibility
setup. En route, we prove that, starting from suitable states, the occupancy
process becomes close to its steady state in a time that is independent of $N$.
Such a large-scale mixing-time result might be of independent interest.
Numerical experiments are conducted, which positively support the theoretical
results.

multichannel) signals in which a single time-series is associated with each of
the nodes or vertex of a graph. Aided by the graph-theoretic tools,
time-varying graph models have the ability to capture the underlying structure
of the data associated with multiple nodes of a graph -- a feat that is hard to
accomplish using standard signal processing approaches. The aim of this
contribution is to propose a method for the decomposition of time-varying graph
signals into a set of graph modes. The graph modes can be interpreted in terms
of their temporal, spectral and topological characteristics. From the temporal
(spectral) viewpoint, the graph modes represent the finite number of
oscillatory signal components (output of multiple band-pass filters whose
center frequencies and bandwidths are learned in a fully data-driven manner),
similar in properties to those obtained from the empirical mode decomposition
and related approaches. From the topological perspective, the graph modes
quantify the functional connectivity of the graph vertices at multiple scales
based on their signal content. In order to estimate the graph modes, a
variational optimization formulation is designed that includes necessary
temporal, spectral and topological requirements relevant to the graph modes. An
efficient method to solve that problem is developed which is based on the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the primal-dual
optimization approach. Finally, the ability of the method to enable a joint
analysis of the temporal and topological characteristics of time-varying graph
signals, at multiple frequency bands/scales, is demonstrated on a series of
synthetic and real time-varying graph data sets.

heating and cooling rate, simulation size, model uncertainty, and the role of
the underlying exchange-correlation functional on the phase behavior of CsPbX3

show that rates below approximately 30 K/ns and system sizes of at least a few
ten thousand atoms are indicated to achieve convergence with regard to these
parameters. By controlling these factors and constructing models that are
specific for different exchange-correlation functionals we then show that the
semi-local functionals considered in this work (SCAN, vdW-DF-cx, PBEsol, and
PBE) systematically underestimate the transition temperatures separating the
perovskite phases while overestimating the lattice parameters. Among the
considered functionals the vdW-DF-cx functional yields the closest agreement
with experiment, followed by SCAN, PBEsol, and PBE. Our work provides
guidelines for the systematic analysis of dynamics and phase transitions in
inorganic halide perovskites and similar systems. It also serves as a benchmark
for the further development of machine-learned potentials as well as
exchange-correlation functionals.

The AeST model shows some deviations from MOND at the radii probed by weak

frameworks and the interaction with the molecular moieties. Here, we address
this question by using a combination of high-resolution spontaneous Raman

disorder in and out of equilibrium and provides surprising observables that
differentiate single- and double-layered perovskites. While no distinct

an off-resonant terahertz pulse can selectively drive a long-lived coherent
phonon mode through a two-photon process in the single-layered system. This
difference highlights the dramatic change in the lattice environment as the

compact objects. However, there is the possibility of constructing
ultra-compact stars for sufficiently large anisotropies. We investigate the
stellar stability against radial oscillations, and we also determine the moment
of inertia and tidal deformability of these stars. We find that the usual
static criterion for radial stability $dM/d\rho_c >0$ still holds for dark
energy stars since the squared frequency of the fundamental pulsation mode
vanishes at the critical central density corresponding to the maximum-mass
configuration. The dependence of the tidal Love number on the anisotropy

transition, where the transition from glass to liquid appears as a dynamic
process where atoms/molecules cooperatively relax into the equilibrium phase,
we experimentally show that the nature of the glass transition depends at a
given temperature on the ratio between the relaxation time of the glass,
{\tau}_glass, taken as its transformation time, and the alpha relaxation time,
{\tau}_{\alpha}. Although the relaxation of liquid-cooled glasses is not
totally synchronous, due to the existence of a distribution of relaxation
times, there has been no clear observation of phase separation. However, at
temperatures at which {\tau}_glass/{\tau}_{\alpha} is large, high mobility
regions nucleate into the liquid phase that subsequently grow by dynamic
facilitation before, or while, cooperative glass relaxation sets into play. On
the contrary, at temperatures associated to smaller
{\tau}_glass/{\tau}_{\alpha} the glass transition proceeds by cooperative
relaxation dynamics all across the material. This behavior is independent of
the experimental procedure or protocol to produce the glass.

introduce a design optimization framework that allows us to co-optimize a

its parameters with respect to the efficiency in a model-free fashion. In the
first step, we train a design-conditioned policy using model-free Reinforcement

design parameters. Afterwards, we use Bayesian Optimization to find the best
design using the policy. We use this framework to optimize the parallel-elastic
spring parameters for the knee of our quadrupedal robot ANYmal together with
the optimal controller. We evaluate the optimized design and controller in
real-world experiments over various terrains. Our results show that the new
system improves the torque-square efficiency of the robot by 33% compared to
the baseline and reduces maximum joint torque by 30% without compromising
tracking performance. The improved design resulted in 11% longer operation time

cues to infer the conditions they may encounter and express potentially
favorable traits. However, external cues can be unreliable or too costly to
use. We consider an alternative strategy where organisms exploit internal
sources of information. Even without sensing environmental cues, their internal
states may become correlated with the environment as a result of selection,
which then form a memory that helps predict future conditions. To demonstrate
the adaptive value of such internal memory in varying environments, we revisit
the classic example of seed dormancy in annual plants. Previous studies have
considered the germination fraction of seeds and its dependence on
environmental cues. In contrast, we consider a model of germination fraction
that depends on the seed age, which is an internal state that can serve as a
memory. We show that, if the environmental variation has temporal structure,
then age-dependent germination fractions will allow the population to have an
increased long-term growth rate. The more organisms can remember through their
internal states, the higher growth rate a population can potentially achieve.
Our results suggest experimental ways to infer internal memory and its benefit
for adaptation in varying environments.

electron distribution. It enables measurements of cosmological parameters,
especially of the expansion rate and the cosmic baryon fraction. The number of
events is expected to increase dramatically over the coming years, and of
particular interest are bursts with identified host galaxy and therefore
redshift information. In this paper, we explore the covariance matrix of the
dispersion measure (DM) of FRBs induced by the large-scale structure, as bursts
from a similar direction on the sky are correlated by long wavelength modes of
the electron distribution. We derive analytical expressions for the covariance
matrix and examine the impact on parameter estimation from the FRB dispersion
measure - redshift relation. The covariance also contains additional
information that is missed by analysing the events individually. For future
samples containing over $\sim300$ FRBs with host identification over the full
sky, the covariance needs to be taken into account for unbiased inference, and
the effect increases dramatically for smaller patches of the sky.

  Consortium Blockchain in Metaverse",,,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The metaverse gradually evolves into a virtual world containing a series of
interconnected sub-metaverses. Diverse digital resources, including identities,
contents, services, and supporting data, are key components of the
sub-metaverse. Therefore, a Domain Name System (DNS)-like system is necessary
for efficient management and resolution. However, the legacy DNS was designed
with security vulnerabilities and trust risks due to centralized issues.
Blockchain is used to mitigate these concerns due to its decentralized
features. Additionally, it supports identity management as a default feature,
making it a natural fit for the metaverse. While there are several DNS
alternatives based on the blockchain, they either manage only a single type of
identifiers or isolate identities from other sorts of identifiers, making it
difficult for sub-metaverses to coexist and connect with each other. This paper
proposes a Multi-Identifier management and resolution System (MIS) in the
metaverse, supporting the registration, resolution, and inter-translation
functions. The basic MIS is portrayed as a four-tier architecture on a
consortium blockchain due to its manageability, enhanced security, and
efficiency properties. On-chain data is lightweight and compressed to save on
storage while accelerating reading and writing operations. The resource data is
encrypted based on the attributes of the sub-metaverse in the storage tier for
privacy protection and access control. For users with decentralization
priorities, a modification named EMIS is built on top of Ethereum. Finally, MIS
is implemented on two testbeds and is available online as the open-source
system. The first testbed consists of 4 physical servers located in the UK and
Malaysia while the second is made up of 200 virtual machines (VMs) spread over
26 countries across all 5 continents on Google Cloud.

in clinical notes by addressing this data sparsity issue through zero-shot
learning. U.S. Veterans Affairs clinical notes served as data. The training
dataset label was determined using diagnostic codes of suicide attempt and
self-harm. A base string associated with the target label of suicidality was
used to provide auxiliary information by narrowing the positive training cases
to those containing the base string. A deep neural network was trained by
mapping the training documents contents to a semantic space. For comparison, we
trained another deep neural network using the identical training dataset labels
and bag-of-words features. The zero shot learning model outperformed the
baseline model in terms of AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and positive
predictive value at multiple probability thresholds. In applying a 0.90
probability threshold, the methodology identified notes not associated with a
relevant ICD 10 CM code that documented suicidality, with 94 percent accuracy.
This new method can effectively identify suicidality without requiring manual

the basis for certified randomness generation, which applies to untrusted

devices, making it unfit for a compact apparatus. Here we provide a general
method for certified randomness generation on a small-scale application-ready

which in the absence of spacelike separation are vulnerable to loopholes
inherent to realistic devices, the protocol we implement accounts for
information leakage to be compatible with emerging compact scalable devices. We
demonstrate a 2-qubit photonic device that achieves the highest standard in

stabilized process harnesses a bright and stable single-photon quantum-dot

indistinguishably of the entangled photons above 93%. Using the contextuality

and positive result: the non-existence of test (super)martingales, and the
consistency of universal inference. To elaborate, the set of log-concave
distributions $\mathcal{L}$ is a nonparametric class, which contains the set
$\mathcal G$ of all possible Gaussians with any mean and covariance. Developing
further the recent geometric concept of fork-convexity, we first prove that
there do no exist any nontrivial test martingales or test supermartingales for
$\mathcal G$ (a process that is simultaneously a nonnegative supermartingale
for every distribution in $\mathcal G$), and hence also for its superset
$\mathcal{L}$. Due to this negative result, we turn our attention to
constructing an e-process -- a process whose expectation at any stopping time
is at most one, under any distribution in $\mathcal{L}$ -- which yields a
level-$\alpha$ test by simply thresholding at $1/\alpha$. We take the approach
of universal inference, which avoids intractable likelihood asymptotics by
taking the ratio of a nonanticipating likelihood over alternatives against the
maximum likelihood under the null. Despite its conservatism, we show that the
resulting test is consistent (power one), and derive its power against
Hellinger alternatives. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other
e-process or sequential test for $\mathcal{L}$.

by seeding faults into the programs under test and asking developers to write

both ""natural"" in a sense easily understood by developers and strong (have high
chances to reveal faults). To achieve this we propose using pre-trained
generative language models (i.e. CodeBERT) that have the ability to produce
developer-like code that operates similarly, but not exactly, as the target
code. This means that the models have the ability to seed natural faults,
thereby offering opportunities to perform mutation testing. We realise this
idea by implementing $\mu$BERT, a mutation testing technique that performs
mutation testing using CodeBert and empirically evaluated it using 689 faulty

$\mu$BERT is higher than that of a state-of-the-art mutation testing (PiTest),

invariant mass spectrum on the renormalization scales $R$ and $\mu_m$ of the
MSR mass $m_\mathrm{t}^{\textrm{MSR}}(R)$ and $\overline{\textrm{MS}}$ mass
$\overline{m}_\mathrm{t}(\mu_m)$, respectively, is carried out. We demonstrate
that a scale choice of $R\sim 80$~GeV is important for the stability of the
cross-section predictions for the low $\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}$
invariant mass range, which is important for a reliable extraction of the top
quark mass. Furthermore, a choice of semi-dynamical renormalization and
factorization scales is preferred. These findings are expected to remain valid
once non-relativistic quasi-bound state effects are included in the low
invariant mass region.

the isothermal incompressibility $\mathcal{K}$ at first order over a small

in good agreement with the results of accurate numerical calculations. These
results are also close to those obtained by using more accurate Tolman and

critical point, was obtained for a finite particle-number average $\langle N

shown that for a large dimensionless parameter, $\alpha \propto

$\mathcal{K}^{\prime\prime}$ is the second derivative of the incompressibility
$\mathcal{K}$ as function of the average particle density $n$, far from the

$\omega\propto 1/\mathcal{K}$, for the fluctuations $\omega$. For a small

$\alpha=0$, one obtains another asymptote of $\omega$. These fluctuations,
having a maximum near the critical point as function of the average density

central aggregator to build a global model. Impermissibility to access client's
data and collaborative training makes FL appealing for applications with
data-privacy concerns such as medical imaging. However, these FL
characteristics pose unprecedented challenges for debugging. When a global
model's performance deteriorates, finding the round and the clients responsible
is a major pain point. Developers resort to trial-and-error debugging with
subsets of clients, hoping to increase the accuracy or let future FL rounds
retune the model, which are time-consuming and costly.
  We design a systematic fault localization framework, FedDebug, that advances
the FL debugging on two novel fronts. First, FedDebug enables interactive
debugging of realtime collaborative training in FL by leveraging record and
replay techniques to construct a simulation that mirrors live FL. FedDebug's
{\em breakpoint} can help inspect an FL state (round, client, and global model)
and seamlessly move between rounds and clients' models, enabling a fine-grained
step-by-step inspection. Second, FedDebug automatically identifies the client
responsible for lowering global model's performance without any testing data
and labels--both are essential for existing debugging techniques. FedDebug's
strengths come from adapting differential testing in conjunction with neurons
activations to determine the precise client deviating from normal behavior.
FedDebug achieves 100\% to find a single client and 90.3\% accuracy to find
multiple faulty clients. FedDebug's interactive debugging incurs 1.2\% overhead
during training, while it localizes a faulty client in only 2.1\% of a round's
training time. With FedDebug, we bring effective debugging practices to
federated learning, improving the quality and productivity of FL application
developers.

capstone courses presented in the literature. The goal of this work is to
understand the pros and cons of different approaches by synthesising the
various aspects of software engineering capstone courses and related
experiences. In a systematic literature review for 2007-2022, we identified 127
primary studies. These studies were analysed based on their presented course
characteristics and the reported course outcomes. The characteristics were
synthesised into a taxonomy consisting of duration, team sizes, client and
project sources, project implementation, and student assessment. We found out
that capstone courses generally last one semester and divide students into
groups of 4-5 where they work on a project for a client. For a slight majority
of courses, the clients are external to the course staff and students are often
expected to produce a proof-of-concept level software product as the main end
deliverable. The courses also offer versatile assessments for students
throughout the project. This paper provides researchers and educators with a
classification of characteristics of software engineering capstone courses
based on previous research. We further synthesise insights on the reported
outcomes of capstone courses. Our review study aims to help educators to
identify various ways of organising capstones and effectively plan and deliver

equidistributed on each side. The proof of this result is remarkably simple,
using only the radial vector field and a Rellich type integrations by parts.
The equidistribution law, including on higher dimensional simplices, agrees
with what Quantum Ergodic Restriction would predict. However, distribution of
the Neumann data on subsets of a side is not well understood, and elementary
methods do not appear to give enough information to draw conclusions.
  In the present note, we first show that an ``obvious'' conjecture fails even

use a result of Marklof-Rudnick \cite{Marklof-Rudnick} in which the authors
show an interior {\it spatial} equidistribution law for a density-one

  Datasets Predict Construction Injuries Better than Company-Specific Models","Added paragraph to background",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this study, we capitalized on a collective dataset repository of 57k
accidents from 9 companies belonging to 3 domains and tested whether models
trained on multiple datasets (generic models) predicted safety outcomes better
than the company-specific models. We experimented with full generic models
(trained on all data), per-domain generic models (construction, electric T&D,
oil & gas), and with ensembles of generic and specific models. Results are very
positive, with generic models outperforming the company-specific models in most
cases while also generating finer-grained, hence more useful, forecasts.
Successful generic models remove the needs for training company-specific
models, saving a lot of time and resources, and give small companies, whose
accident datasets are too limited to train their own models, access to safety
outcome predictions. It may still however be advantageous to train specific
models to get an extra boost in performance through ensembling with the generic
models. Overall, by learning lessons from a pool of datasets whose accumulated
experience far exceeds that of any single company, and making these lessons
easily accessible in the form of simple forecasts, generic models tackle the
holy grail of safety cross-organizational learning and dissemination in the
construction industry.

described using the equation of state of a degenerate Fermi gas. We consider
two different scenarios for the distribution of the dark matter. In the first
scenario the dark matter is confined to the core of the star, whereas in the
second scenario the dark matter extends beyond the surface of the baryonic
matter, forming a halo around the baryonic star. The presence of dark matter
alters the star's reaction to the companion's tidal forces, which we
investigate in terms of the coordinate deformation and mass shedding
parameters. The constructed quasi-equilibrium configurations mark the first
step towards consistent numerical-relativity simulations of dark matter admixed
neutron star binaries.

planar anisotropy hosts a strongly fluctuating dipolar spin liquid (DSL), which
originates from the intriguing interplay between dipolar and Heisenberg
interactions. The DSL constitutes an extended regime in the field-temperature
phase diagram, which gets lowered in temperature as field increases and
eventually ends with an unconventional quantum critical point (QCP) at
$B_c\simeq 0.75$~T. Based on dipolar Heisenberg model calculations, we identify
the DSL as a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase with emergent U(1)
symmetry. Due to the tremendous entropy accumulation that can be related to the
strong BKT and quantum fluctuations, unprecedented magnetic cooling effects are
observed in the DSL regime and particularly near the QCP, making KBGB a
superior dipolar coolant to commercial Gd-based refrigerants. We establish the
phase diagram for triangular-lattice dipolar quantum magnets where emergent
symmetry plays an essential role, and provide a basis and opens an avenue for
their applications in sub-Kelvin refrigeration.

obtain a corrected gradient. Our method can be used with most popular sparse
training pipelines under both standard and adversarial setups. Theoretically,
we prove that our method can accelerate the convergence rate of sparse

finite-blocklength analysis of the URLLC error probability relying on the use
of mismatched decoding, and of the so-called saddlepoint approximation.
Puncturing (PUNC) and superposition coding (SPC) are considered as alternative
downlink coexistence strategies to deal with the inter-service interference,
under the assumption of only statistical channel state information (CSI)
knowledge at the users. eMBB and URLLC performances are then evaluated over
different precoding techniques and power control schemes, by accounting for
imperfect CSI knowledge at the base stations, pilot-based estimation overhead,
pilot contamination, spatially correlated channels, the structure of the radio
frame, and the characteristics of the URLLC activation pattern. Simulation
results reveal that SPC is, in many operating regimes, superior to PUNC in
providing higher SE for the eMBB yet achieving the target reliability for the
URLLC with high probability. Moreover, PUNC might cause eMBB service outage in
presence of high URLLC traffic loads. However, PUNC turns to be necessary to
preserve the URLLC performance in scenarios where the multi-user interference

various perspectives, it remains unclear why the most popular forms of NAG must
handle convex and strongly convex objective functions separately. Motivated by
this inconsistency, we propose an NAG method that unifies the existing ones for
the convex and strongly convex cases. We first design a Lagrangian function
that continuously extends the first Bregman Lagrangian to the strongly convex
setting. As a specific case of the Euler--Lagrange equation for this
Lagrangian, we derive an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, which we
call the unified NAG ODE, that bridges the gap between the ODEs that model NAG
for convex and strongly convex objective functions. We then design the unified
NAG, a novel momentum method whereby the continuous-time limit corresponds to
the unified ODE. The coefficients and the convergence rates of the unified NAG
and unified ODE are continuous in the strong convexity parameter $\mu$ on $[0,
+\infty)$. Unlike the existing popular algorithm and ODE for strongly convex
objective functions, the unified NAG and the unified NAG ODE always have
superior convergence guarantees compared to the known algorithms and ODEs for
non-strongly convex objective functions. This property is beneficial in
practical perspective when considering strongly convex objective functions with
small $\mu$. Furthermore, we extend our unified dynamics and algorithms to the
higher-order setting. Last but not least, we propose the unified NAG-G ODE, a
novel ODE model for minimizing the gradient norm of strongly convex objective

transfer between a band with Chern number $C = +1$ and a band with $C = -1$ via
a gapless edge mode, in agreement with the bulk-edge correspondence for

contemporary decompositions are primarily tile-based, our method operates by
partitioning an even share of the aggregate inner loop iterations among
physical processing elements. This provides a near-perfect utilization of
computing resources, regardless of how efficiently the output tiling for any
given problem quantizes across the underlying processing elements.
  On GPU processors, our Stream-K parallelization of GEMM produces a peak
speedup of up to 14$\times$ and 6.7$\times$, and an average performance
response that is both higher and more consistent across 32,824 GEMM problem
geometries than state-of-the-art math libraries such as CUTLASS and cuBLAS.
Furthermore, we achieve this performance from a single tile size configuration
per floating-point precision, whereas today's math libraries employ complex
kernel-selection heuristics to select from a large ensemble of kernel variants.

our conclusions we stack all spectra and obtain a deep-stacked spectrum of
24.75 hrs. The stacked Lya profile displays a clear asymmetric red peak and an
absence of a blue peak. We additionally estimate the intrinsic stacked Lya
profile of our targets by correcting for IGM transmission using a range of
neutral hydrogen fractions, finding no significant change in the profile. We
measure a velocity offset Vred > 300 km/s and an asymmetry in our red peak A
~3. Using various models and estimators such as the peak separation, the
asymmetry of the red peak, the ratio between Lya and Hb and the beta slope, we

finds in general very good results, with the extracted value of $\alpha_s$
agreeing well with the world average. This is the case in particular for the
thrust and $C$-parameter for which notably small values of $\alpha_s$ have been
reported when non-perturbative corrections have been computed using analytic

the potential of nuclear (<50 pc) continuum observations with ALMA to discover
hidden growing SMBH pairs. While the exact occurrence rate of close-separation
dual AGN is not yet known, it may be surprisingly high, given that UGC 4211 was

to be fully understood. There is an increasing number of successful examples of
reproducing explosions in multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations, but
subsequent studies pointed out that the growth rates of the explosion energy
$\dot{E}_\mathrm{expl}$ of these simulations are insufficient to produce enough
$^{56}$Ni to match observations. This issue is known as the `$^{56}$Ni problem'
in CCSNe. Recently, however, some studies have suggested that this $^{56}$Ni
problem is derived from the simplicity of the explosion model. In response, we
investigate the effect of the explosion energy growth rate
$\dot{E}_\mathrm{expl}$ on the behavior of nucleosynthesis in CCSNe in a more
realistic model. We employ the 1D Lagrangian hydrodynamic code, in which we
take neutrino heating and cooling terms into account with the light-bulb
approximation. We reiterate that, consistent with previous rebuttal studies,
there is the $^{56}$Ni problem: Although $^{56}$Ni is synthesized to almost the
same mass coordinate independent of $\dot{E}_\mathrm{expl}$, some of the
innermost material in the low-$\dot{E}_\mathrm{expl}$ model failed to escape,
leading to a shift in the innermost mass coordinate of the ejecta to the outer
positions. Comparing our results with observations, we find that while modern
slow explosions can, in principle, reproduce observations of standard Type II
SNe, this is not possible with stripped-envelope SNe. Our finding places a
strong constraint on the explosion mechanism. There are significant differences
in the progenitor structures and the explosion mechanism between Type II and
stripped-envelope SNe.

Mach numbers, a Sedov blast wave, different tests including self-gravity such
as gravitational freefall, a hydrostatic sphere, the Zeldovich-pancake, and the
nifty cluster as cosmological application. Advantages over SPH include
increased mixing and a better convergence behavior. We demonstrate that the
MFM-solver is robust, also in a cosmological context. We show evidence that the
solver preforms extraordinarily well when applied to decaying subsonic
turbulence, a problem very difficult to handle for many methods. MFM captures
the expected velocity power spectrum with high accuracy and shows a good
convergence behavior. Using MFM or SPH within OpenGadget3 leads to a comparable
decay in turbulent energy due to numerical dissipation. When studying the
energy decay for different initial turbulent energy fractions, we find that MFM
performs well down to Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}\approx 0.007$. Finally, we show

(Yamada et al. 2021), we estimate the properties of host galaxies, active
galactic nucleus (AGN) tori, and polar dust. The star formation rates (SFRs)
become larger with merger stage and most of them are above the main sequence.
The SFRs are correlated with radio luminosity, indicating starburst emission is
dominant in the radio band. Although polar-dust extinction is much smaller than
torus extinction, the UV-to-IR (mainly IR) polar dust luminosities are $\sim$2
times larger than the torus ones. The polar-dust temperature decreases while
the physical size, estimated by the temperature and dust sublimation radius,
increases with AGN luminosity from a few tens of parsec (early mergers) to
kiloparsec scales (late mergers), where the polar dust is likely the expanding
(i.e., evolving) dusty outflows. The comparison between SFRs and intrinsic AGN
luminosities suggests that the starbursts occur first and AGNs arise later, and
overall their growth rates follow the simultaneous coevolution relation that
can establish the local galaxy-SMBH mass relation. We confirm the coexistence
of intense starbursts, AGNs, and large-scale outflows in late mergers,
supporting a standard AGN feedback scenario.

the hot CGM (corona) triggered by the fountain. Our dynamical model reproduces
the distribution and kinematics of the EPG H$\mathrm{\scriptsize{I}}$ emission

$4.7^{+1.2}_{-0.9}\times10^8\mathrm{M}_\odot$, with a typical scale height of
around 1 kpc and a vertical gradient of the rotation velocity of
$-10.0\pm2.7\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-1}}$. The best-fitting model requires a
characteristic outflow velocity of $50\pm10\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. The
outflowing gas starts out mostly ionised and only becomes neutral later in the
trajectory. The accretion rate from the condensation of the inner hot CGM
inferred by the model is 0.8$\,\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$,
approximately equal to the star formation rate in this galaxy

profile, which peaks at a radius of about 4.5$\,$kpc, predicts a disc growth
rate compatible with the observed value. Our results indicate that
fountain-driven corona condensation is a likely mechanism to sustain star

clear evidence for an AT line. For $\sigma = 0.75$, there is evidence from
finite size scaling studies for an AT transition but for $\sigma = 0.85$, the
evidence for a transition is non-existent. We have also studied these systems
at fixed temperature varying the field and discovered that at both $\sigma =

the correlation length and spin glass susceptibility as a function of the field

hence the non-existence of an AT line. The evidence from our simulations points
to the complete absence of the AT line in dimensions outside the mean-field

which suggested there was an AT line can be attributed to the consequences of
studying systems which are just too small. The collapse of our data to the
droplet scaling form is poor for $\sigma = 0.75$ and to some extent also for
$\sigma = 0.85$, when the correlation length becomes of the order of the length
of the system, due to the existence of excitations which only cost a free
energy of $O(1)$, just as envisaged in the TNT picture of the ordered state of
spin glasses. However, for the case of $\sigma = 0.85$ we can provide evidence
that for larger system sizes, droplet scaling will prevail even when the

central massive protostellar object MIR 2, with magnetic fields mostly parallel
to the east-west Streamer but oriented north-south across MIR 2. The magnetic

across the cloud, which traces in both total intensity and polarised flux, a
powerful bipolar outflow from MIR 2 that interacts strongly with the Streamer.
The magnetic field is also strongly aligned along the outflow direction;
energetically, it may dominate the outflow near MIR 2, comprising rare evidence
for a magnetocentrifugal origin to such outflows. A portion of the Streamer may
be in Keplerian rotation around MIR 2, implying a gravitating mass 1350$\pm$50
M$_{\odot}$ for the protostar+disk+envelope; alternatively, these kinematics
can be explained by gas in free fall towards a 950$\pm$35 M$_{\odot}$ object.
The high accretion rate onto MIR 2 apparently occurs through the Streamer/disk,
and could account for $\sim$33% of MIR 2's total luminosity via gravitational

features across the whole electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma rays,
especially in the bands where there is a desert i.e. regions where no strong
lines from baryons are expected. Such novel signatures can arise for dark
matter models with a composite nature and internal electromagnetic transitions.
The photons from a background source can interact with the dark matter
resulting in an absorption signal in the source spectrum. In the case of a
compact source, such as a quasar, such interactions in the dark matter halos
can produce a series of closely spaced absorption lines, which we call the dark
forest. We show that the dark forest feature is a sensitive probe of the dark
matter self-interactions and the halo mass function, especially at the low mass
end. Moreover, the absorption of CMB photons by dark matter gives rise to a
global absorption signal in the CMB spectrum. For dark matter transition
energies in the range $2.5\times 10^{-4} \text{eV}$-$5\times 10^{3}$ eV, such
absorption features result in spectral distortions of the CMB in the COBE/FIRAS
band of 60-600 GHz. If the dark matter transition frequency is $\sim$156 GHz,

weakly connected to a sparse periphery, and an alternative structure in which
the core is strongly connected both within itself and to the periphery.
Networks vary in whether they are better represented by one type of structure

core-periphery structure and community structure, in which networks have a set
of non-overlapping cores that correspond roughly to communities, surrounded by
a single undifferentiated periphery. Computer code implementing our methods is

strong sensitivity to the initial condition, wherein some initial states give
rise to persistent quantum revivals -- a type of weak ergodicity breaking known
as `quantum many-body scarring' (QMBS). Recent work [Phys.Rev.B 105, 125123
(2022)] pointed out that QMBS gets destroyed by tuning the system to a quantum
critical point, echoing the disappearance of long-range order in the system's
ground state at equilibrium. Here we show that this picture can be much richer
in systems that display QMBS dynamics from a continuous family of initial
conditions: as the system is tuned across the critical point while at the same
time deforming the initial state, the dynamical signatures of QMBS at
intermediate times can undergo an apparently smooth evolution across the
equilibrium phase transition point. We demonstrate this using the PXP model --
a paradigmatic model of QMBS that has recently been realized in Rydberg atom
arrays as well as ultracold bosonic atoms in a tilted optical lattice. Using
exact diagonalization and matrix product state methods, we map out the
dynamical phase diagram of the PXP model with the quenched chemical potential.
We demonstrate the existence of a continuous family of initial states that give
rise to QMBS and formulate a ramping protocol that can be used to prepare such
states in experiment. Our results show the ubiquity of scarring in the PXP
model and highlight its intriguing interplay with quantum criticality.

launched from an accreting alpha-disc. Building on previous work where the
driving radiation field is static, we compute a time-dependent radiation flux
from the local, variable accretion rate of the disc. We find that prior to the
establishment of a steady state in the disc, variations of ~ 15% in disc
luminosity correlate with variations of ~ 2-3 in the mass flux of the wind.
After a steady state is reached, when luminosity variations drop to ~ 3%, these
correlations vanish as the variability in the mass flux is dominated by the
intrinsic variability of the winds. This is especially evident in lower
luminosity runs where intrinsic variability is higher due to a greater
prevalence of failed winds. The changing mass flux occurs primarily due to the
formation of clumps and voids near the disc atmosphere that propagate out into
the low velocity part of the flow, a process that can be influenced by local
variations in disc intensity. By computing the normalised standard deviation of
the mass outflow, we show that the impact of luminosity variations on mass
outflow is more visible at higher luminosity. However, the absolute change in
mass outflow due to luminosity increases is larger for lower luminosity models
due to the luminosity-mass flux scaling relation becoming steeper. We further
discuss implications for CVs and AGN and observational prospects.

detection named Structural Attention-Based Recurrent VAE (SABeR-VAE), which
explicitly uses the structure of the environment to aid anomaly identification.
Specifically, we use a vehicle self-attention module to learn the relations
among vehicles on a road, and a separate lane-vehicle attention module to model
the importance of permissible lanes to aid in trajectory prediction.
Conditioned on the attention modules' outputs, a recurrent encoder-decoder
architecture with a stochastic Koopman operator-propagated latent space
predicts the next states of vehicles. Our model is trained end-to-end to
minimize prediction loss on normal vehicle behaviors, and is deployed to detect
anomalies in (ab)normal scenarios. By combining the heterogeneous vehicle and
lane information, SABeR-VAE and its deterministic variant, SABeR-AE, improve
abnormal AUPR by 18% and 25% respectively on the simulated MAAD highway dataset

hierarchical off-diagonal low-rank (HODLR) matrix approximations. In this work,
we show that a class of Hessians that arise from inverse problems governed by

inverse problems governed by PDEs that model the instantaneous viscous flow of

consistent with ice sheet surface velocity observations. We demonstrate the use
of HODLR approximation by efficiently generating Hessian approximations that
allow fast generation of samples from a Gaussianized posterior proposal

problem regimes for which the Gauss-Newton data-misfit Hessian is more
efficiently approximated by the HODLR matrix format than the low-rank (LR)

shows many unique qualities including a flat-topped [Ar III] 8.991 um profile,
a strongly tilted [Co III] 11.888 um feature, and multiple stable Ni lines.
These features provide critical information about the physics of the explosion.
The observations are compared to synthetic spectra from detailed NLTE
multi-dimensional models. The results of the best-fitting model are used to
identify the components of the spectral blends and provide a quantitative
comparison to the explosion physics. Emission line profiles and the presence of
electron capture (EC) elements are used to constrain the mass of the exploding
white dwarf (WD) and the chemical asymmetries in the ejecta. We show that the
observations of SN 2021aefx are consistent with an off-center
delayed-detonation explosion of a near-Chandrasekhar mass (Mch) WD at a viewing
angle of -30 degrees relative to the point of the deflagration-to-detonation
transition. From the strength of the stable Ni lines we determine that there is
little to no mixing in the central regions of the ejecta. Based on both the
presence of stable Ni and the Ar velocity distributions, we obtain a strict
lower limit of 1.2 Msun of the initial WD, implying that most sub-Mch
explosions models are not viable models for SN 2021aefx. The analysis here

  Aims: This study aims to extend Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT),

matter N-body calculations at the field level.
  Methods: We extend Augmented LPT (ALPT) to an Eulerian framework, dubbed
eALPT. This enables modelling the stress tensor, with this introducing
vorticity. To compensate that ALPT assumes curl-free fields, a fraction of the
vorticity, emerging after each Eulerian transformation, is added to the
subsequent timestep. The model has three free parameters apart from the choice
of cosmology, redshift snapshots, cosmic volume, and the number of
particles-cells.
  Results: We find that the cross-correlation of the dark matter distribution

by multiple spacecraft including Solar Orbiter (SolO). The event was associated
with an M1.6 flare, a coronal mass ejection (CME) and a shock wave. During the
event, high-energy protons and electrons were recorded by multiple instruments
located within a narrow longitudinal cone. An interesting aspect of the event
was the multi-stage particle energization during the flare impulsive phase and
also what appears to be a separate phase of electron acceleration detected at
SolO after the flare maximum. We aim to investigate and identify the multiple
sources of energetic electron acceleration. We utilize SEP electron
observations from the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) and hard X-ray (HXR)
observations from the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on-board
SolO, in combination with radio observations at a broad frequency range. We
focus on establishing an association between the energetic electrons and the
different HXR and radio emissions associated with the multiple acceleration
episodes. We have found that the flare was able to accelerate electrons for at
least 20 minutes during the nonthermal phase observed in the form of five
discrete HXR pulses. We also show evidence that the shock wave has contributed
to the electron acceleration during and after the impulsive flare phase. The
detailed analysis of EPD electron data shows that there was a time difference
in the release of low- and high-energy electrons, with the high-energy release
delayed. Also, the observed electron anisotropy characteristics suggest
different connectivity during the two phases of acceleration.

leftovers of defunct stars. Their morphology and emission properties provide
insights into the evolutionary history of the progenitor star. But while some
SNRs are spherical, as expected from a point-like explosion expanding into a
roughly uniform medium, many others exhibit complex non-spherical morphologies
which are often not easily explained. In this work, we use three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic simulations to show that rectangular and jet-like
morphologies can be explained by supernovae (SNe), either type Ia or type II,
expanding within anisotropic, bipolar stellar wind bubbles driven by the
progenitor star. The stellar wind has an anisotropic density distribution,
which channels the SN ejecta differently depending on the anisotropy
characteristics. We compute synthetic thermal (X-ray) and non-thermal
(synchrotron) emission maps from our numerical simulations to compare with
observations. We find rectangular morphologies are generated when the stellar
wind has a high mass loss rate and forms a dense, narrow disk at the equatorial
region. Instead, a jet-like or ear-like morphology is obtained when the stellar
wind develops a wide, dense disk. Stellar winds with low mass-loss rates do not
strongly influence the SNR morphology. Finally, our synthetic synchrotron and
X-ray maps for the high mass-loss rate case qualitatively agree with the
observations of the SNRs G332.5-5.6 and G290.1-0.8.

significant frequency partition points and to identify components and

Finite-sample performance of the proposed method is illustrated via

in students. To model data arising from such assessments, cognitive diagnostic
models with discrete latent variables have gained popularity in educational and
behavioral sciences. In a learning context, the latent variables often denote
sequentially acquired skill attributes, which is often modeled by the so-called
attribute hierarchy method. One drawback of the traditional attribute hierarchy
method is that its parameter complexity varies substantially with the
hierarchy's graph structure, lacking statistical parsimony. Additionally,
arrows among the attributes do not carry an interpretation of statistical
dependence. Motivated by these, we propose a new family of latent conjunctive
Bayesian networks (LCBNs), which rigorously unify the attribute hierarchy
method for sequential skill mastery and the Bayesian network model in
statistical machine learning. In an LCBN, the latent graph not only retains the
hard constraints on skill prerequisites as an attribute hierarchy, but also
encodes nice conditional independence interpretation as a Bayesian network.
LCBNs are identifiable, interpretable, and parsimonious statistical tools to
diagnose students' cognitive abilities from assessment data. We propose an
efficient two-step EM algorithm for structure learning and parameter estimation
in LCBNs. Application of our method to an international educational assessment

most studies have been confined to the parameters $S_V$ and $L$, the important

neutron matter incompressibility $K_N$, are discussed. Strong correlations
among $S_V, L$, and $K_{N}$ are found from both nuclear binding energies and
neutron matter theory. However, these correlations somewhat differ in the two
cases, and those from neutron matter theory have smaller uncertainties. To 68\%
confidence, it is found from neutron matter theory that $S_V=32.0\pm1.1$ MeV,
$L=51.9\pm7.9$ MeV and $K_N=152.2\pm38.1$ MeV. Theoretical predictions for
neutron skin thickness and dipole polarizability measurements of the

$L=-5\pm40$ MeV, respectively, to 68\% confidence. However, we show that
nuclear interactions optimally satisfying both measurements imply $L=53\pm13$
MeV, nearly the range suggested by either nuclear mass measurements or neutron

surface warming. This trend suggests that very vigorous convection might be the
norm in extremely hot and humid atmospheres, such as those undergoing a runaway
greenhouse transition. However, theoretical and numerical evidence suggests
that convection is actually gentle in water vapor-dominated atmospheres,
implying that convective vigor may peak at some intermediate humidity level.
Here, we perform small-domain convection-resolving simulations of an Earth-like
atmosphere over a wide range of surface temperatures and confirm that there is
indeed a peak in convective vigor, which we show occurs near T_s ~ 330 K. We
show that a similar peak in convective vigor exists when the relative abundance
of water vapor is changed by varying the amount of background (non-condensing)
gas at fixed T_s, which may have implications for Earth's climate and
atmospheric chemistry during the Hadean and Archean. We also show that
Titan-like thermodynamics (i.e., a thick nitrogen atmosphere with condensing
methane and low gravity) produce a peak in convective vigor at T_s ~ 95 K,
which is curiously close to the current surface temperature of Titan. Plotted
as functions of the saturation specific humidity at cloud base, metrics of
convective vigor from both Earth-like and Titan-like experiments all peak when
cloud-base air contains roughly 10% of the condensible gas by mass. Our results
point to a potentially common phenomenon in terrestrial atmospheres: that moist
convection is most vigorous when the condensible component is between dilute
and non-dilute abundance.

recombination-enhanced dislocation glide and III-V/Si residual strain. Beyond
these direct effects of increased nonradiative recombination, we find the
long-range strain field of misfit dislocations deeper in the defect filter

for securing satellite communication. We classify main satellite applications
into five domains, namely: Satellite-terrestrial, satellite-based IoT,
Satellite navigation systems, FSO-based, and inter-satellite. In each domain,
we discuss and investigate how PLS can be used to improve the system's overall

defining standard interfaces for adding new, or updating additional, components

of galactic and environmental parameters, utilizing a machine learning approach
with Random Forest classification. We have previously demonstrated the power of
this technique to isolate causality, not mere correlation, in complex
astronomical data. First, we analyze three cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations (Eagle, Illustris, and IllustrisTNG), selecting snapshots spanning
the bulk of cosmic history from comic noon ($z \sim 2$) to the present epoch,
with stellar masses in the range $9 < \log(M_*/M_{\odot}) < 12$. In the
simulations, black hole mass is unanimously found to be the most predictive
parameter of central galaxy quenching at all epochs. Perhaps surprisingly,
black hole accretion rate (and hence the bolometric luminosity of active
galactic nuclei, AGN) is found to be of little predictive power over quenching.
This theoretical result is important for observational studies of galaxy
quenching as it cautions against using the current AGN state of a galaxy as a
useful proxy for the cumulative impact of AGN feedback on a galactic system.
The latter is traced by black hole mass not AGN luminosity. Additionally, we
explore a sub-set of 'observable' parameters, which can be readily measured in
extant wide-field galaxy surveys targeting $z = 0 - 2$, at $9 <
\log(M_*/M_{\odot}) < 12$. All three simulations predict that in lieu of black
hole mass, the stellar gravitational potential will outperform the other
parameters in predicting quenching. We confirm this theoretical prediction
observationally in the SDSS (at low redshifts) and in CANDELS (at intermediate
and high redshifts).

produce gas inflows, which in turn may trigger accretion onto the supermassive

studied in galaxy pairs, the frequency of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in fully
coalesced post-merger systems is poorly constrained due to the limited size or
impurity of extant post-merger samples. Previously, we combined convolutional
neural network (CNN) predictions with visual classifications to identify a
highly pure sample of 699 post-mergers in deep r-band imaging. In the work
presented here, we quantify the frequency of AGN in this sample using three
metrics: optical emission lines, mid-infrared (mid- IR) colour, and radio
detection of low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs). We also compare the
frequency of AGN in post-mergers to that in a sample of spectroscopically
identified galaxy pairs. We find that AGN identified by narrow-line optical
emission and mid-IR colour have an increased incidence rate in post-mergers,
with excesses of ~4 over mass- and redshift-matched controls. The optical and
mid-IR AGN excesses in post-mergers exceed the values found for galaxy pairs,
indicating that AGN activity in mergers peaks after coalescence. Conversely, we
recover no significant excess of LERGs in post-mergers or pairs. Finally, we
find that the [OIII] luminosity (a proxy for SMBH accretion rate) in
post-mergers that host an optical AGN is ~0.3 dex higher on average than in
non-interacting galaxies with an optical AGN, suggesting that mergers generate
higher accretion rates than secular triggering mechanisms.

populations is the degeneracy between age, reddening, and metallicity. When a
single metallicity is used for all star clusters in a galaxy, this degeneracy
can result in $`$catastrophic$'$ errors for old globular clusters. Typically,
approximately 10 - 20 % of all clusters detected in spiral galaxies can have
ages that are incorrect by a factor of ten or more. In this paper we present a
pilot study for four galaxies (NGC 628, NGC 1433, NGC 1365, and NGC 3351) from
the PHANGS-HST survey. We describe methods to correct the age-dating for old
globular clusters, by first identifying candidates using their colors, and then
reassigning ages and reddening based on a lower metallicity solution. We find
that young $`$interlopers$'$ can be identified from their Halpha flux. CO (2-1)
intensity or the presence of dust can also be used, but our tests show that
they do not work as well. Improvements in the success fraction are possible at
the $\sim$ 15 % level (reducing the fraction of catastrophic age-estimates from
between 13 - 21 % to 3 - 8 %). A large fraction of the incorrectly age-dated
globular clusters are systematically given ages around 100 Myr, polluting the
younger populations as well. Incorrectly age-dated globular clusters
significantly impact the observed cluster age distribution in NGC 628, which
affects the physical interpretation of cluster disruption in this galaxy. For
NGC 1365, we also demonstrate how to fix a second major age-dating problem,
where very dusty young clusters with E(B-V) $>$ 1.5 mag are assigned old,
globular-cluster like ages. Finally, we note the discovery of a dense
population of $\sim$ 300 Myr clusters around the central region of NGC 1365.

Among those websites, 33% of them expose users' passwords to the CDNs, and a
popular CDN may observe passwords from more than 40% of its customers. This
result suggests that if a CDN infrastructure has a vulnerability or an insider

be the product of all these expansions. Consequently, non-leading cross terms

observables could be significant. In particular, we argue that the chiral
magnetic effect (CME) and elliptic flow can develop separately, with their
convolution affecting the observable that is sensitive to the shear-induced
CME. We will use the event-by-event anomalous-viscous fluid dynamics model to
illustrate the effects of this scenario. Besides giving new insights into

quantum computing is the development of interconnected and individually

visible-spectrum, multi-channel photonic integrated circuit (PIC) systems for
scalable atom control. However, it has remained an open challenge to realize
optical programmability with a qubit layer that can achieve high optical

by introducing a modular architecture of piezoelectrically-actuated
atom-control PICs (APICs) and artificial atoms embedded in diamond
nanostructures designed for high-efficiency free-space collection. The
high-speed 4-channel APIC is based on a splitting tree mesh with triple-phase

optically broadband operation at visible wavelengths, high-fidelity switching
($> 40$ dB) at low voltages, sub-$\mu$s modulation timescales ($> 30$ MHz), and
minimal channel-to-channel crosstalk for repeatable optical pulse carving. Via
a reconfigurable free-space interconnect, we use the APIC to address single
silicon vacancy color centers in individual diamond waveguides with inverse
tapered couplers, achieving efficient single photon detection probabilities
(15$\%$) and second-order autocorrelation measurements $g^{(2)}(0) < 0.14$ for
all channels. The modularity of this distributed APIC - quantum memory system
simplifies the quantum control problem, potentially enabling further scaling to
1000s of channels.

  mention of local isosceles paths to the title",,,,"math.HO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Ellipses, parabolas and hyperbolas all have beautiful reflective properties.
However, an intuitive explanation for why they have those properties has been
lacking. There exist many mathematical proofs, but they tend to involve several
analytical steps or geometrical constructions, making them unintuitive and hard
to understand. Here, a simpler explanation is presented which only requires
following the paths of light rays, and examining local paths that move from one
point on a conic to a nearby one. First, a light-ray is followed as it runs
along one of the legs of an isosceles triangle, and then reflects off a mirror
that is parallel to the triangle's base. It bounces back along the path of the
triangle's other leg. Next, a path is examined, moving from an arbitrary point
on a conic section curve to a nearby point on the same curve. This path
consists of two equal-length straight line steps, with each step following one
of the constraints that defines the curve. For example, on an ellipse, defined
by the sum of the distances to the two foci remaining constant, the path starts
at a point on the ellipse, moves a distance delta directly away from one focus,
then makes a second equal-length step directly towards the second focus. These
two steps form the legs of precisely the sort of isosceles triangle described
above, with its base running along the path of the curve. A light ray following
the legs of that triangle gets reflected directly from one focus to the other.
As the triangle shrinks towards zero, the reflection point converges onto the
actual curve. Exactly the same argument also explains the reflections of
parabolas and hyperbolas. Surprisingly, this explanation does not seem to have
appeared previously in the long history of writings about conics. It is hoped
that it will help to make the reflective properties of conic sections easier to
understand and to explain.

This is the case, for instance, when the data registry is formed by interval
sampling. Double truncation generally induces a sampling bias on the target
variable, so proper corrections of ordinary estimation and inference procedures
must be used. Unfortunately, the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator of
a doubly truncated distribution has several drawbacks, like potential
non-existence and non-uniqueness issues, or large estimation variance.
Interestingly, no correction for double truncation is needed when the sampling
bias is ignorable, which may occur with interval sampling and other sampling
designs. In such a case the ordinary empirical distribution function is a
consistent and fully efficient estimator that generally brings remarkable
variance improvements compared to the nonparametric maximum likelihood
estimator. Thus, identification of such situations is critical for the simple
and efficient estimation of the target distribution. In this paper we introduce
for the first time formal testing procedures for the null hypothesis of
ignorable sampling bias with doubly truncated data. The asymptotic properties
of the proposed test statistic are investigated. A bootstrap algorithm to
approximate the null distribution of the test in practice is introduced. The
finite sample performance of the method is studied in simulated scenarios.
Finally, applications to data on onset for childhood cancer and Parkinson's
disease are given. Variance improvements in estimation are discussed and
illustrated.

of flux, exhibits a two-humped distribution well matched to the AGN and
star-forming galaxy (SFG) populations, and with each population contributing
roughly equal energy. Only at 3 GHz are the source count contributions to the
EBL fully convergent, and hence we report empirical lower limits to the
radio-EBL in the remaining bands. Adopting predictions from the SHARK
semi-analytic model for the form of the SFG population, we can fit the fainter
source counts providing measurements of the total contribution to the radio-EBL
for the SFG and the AGN populations separately. This constitutes an empirically
constrained model-dependent measurement for the SFG contribution, but a fully
empirical measurement of the AGN contribution. Using the {\sc ProSpect}
spectral energy distribution code we can model the UV-optical-infrared-mm-radio

adoption of a Chabrier initial mass function. However, significant discrepancy
remains ($5\times$) between our source-count estimates of the radio-EBL and the

consider a partially functional model, under which some covariates are scalars

unspecified nonlinear effects. Significantly advancing from the existing
literature, we consider a model with interactions between the functional and
scalar covariates. To accommodate long-tailed error distributions which are not
uncommon in data analysis, we adopt the quantile technique for estimation. To
achieve more interpretable estimation, and to accommodate many practical
settings, we assume that the functional covariate effects are locally sparse
(that is, there exist subregions on which the effects are exactly zero), which
naturally leads to a variable/model selection problem. We propose respecting
the ""main effect, interaction"" hierarchy, which postulates that if a subregion
has a nonzero effect in an interaction term, then its effect has to be nonzero
in the corresponding main functional effect. For estimation, identification of
local sparsity, and respect of the hierarchy, we propose a penalization
approach. An effective computational algorithm is developed, and the
consistency properties are rigorously established under mild regularity
conditions. Simulation shows the practical effectiveness of the proposed
approach. The analysis of the Tecator data further demonstrates its practical
applicability. Overall, this study can deliver a novel and practically useful

We also find four empirical phenomena observed during the training, such as
emergent coordinate-ascent style training that naturally alternates between
modalities, guidelines for selecting critical hyper-parameters, and connections
between mixed-modal competition and training stability. Finally, we test our
scaling law by training a 30B speech-text model, which significantly

materials simulations, they must be thoroughly tested and validated. The
existing tests on the radial distribution function and mean-squared

X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) signals, which capture the density

density-of-state in the solid phase and the liquid-solid phase transition

of the solid phase only when the configurations from the solid phase are

appropriately selecting the training data set when developing machine-learned

is able to learn how to complete an unknown task having access to only a part

attention and active perception that are characteristic of humans and tried to
apply them to our agent, creating a hard attention mechanism. In this
mechanism, the model decides first which region of the input image it should
look at, and only after that it has access to the pixels of that region.
Current RL agents do not follow this principle and we have not seen these
mechanisms applied to the same purpose as this work. In our architecture, we
adapt an existing model called recurrent attention model (RAM) and combine it
with the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. We investigate whether a
model with these characteristics is capable of achieving similar performance to
state-of-the-art model-free RL agents that access the full input observation.
This analysis is made in two Atari games, Pong and SpaceInvaders, which have a
discrete action space, and in CarRacing, which has a continuous action space.
Besides assessing its performance, we also analyze the movement of the
attention of our model and compare it with what would be an example of the
human behavior. Even with such visual limitation, we show that our model
matches the performance of PPO+LSTM in two of the three games tested.

reasonablly addressed for individual microscopic configuration by two different
ways of special vector field on configuration space, anharmonicity in the

equiatomic binary alloys that have been most studied in the CN-based context.
We confirm that while one of the contribution to CN of DdG for each
configuration, due to difference in CDOS from Gaussian, exhibits significant
positive correlation with ASDF, another contribution of Dns due to
non-separability in structural degee of freedoms (SDFs) exhibit no effective
correlation with ASDF, which can be naturally accepted since the former
contribution depends on ASDF itself, while the latter is independent. We find
that average of Dns over all configurations for sets of SDFs can be
well-characterized by information about asymmetric Hausdorff distance between
configurational polyhedra (CP) for practical and ideally separable system, and
CP hypervolumes. This fact certainly indicates that non-local information about

issue, max K sliced Wasserstein (Max-K-SW) distance ($K\geq 1$), seeks the best
discriminative orthogonal projecting directions. Despite being able to reduce
the number of projections, the metricity of Max-K-SW cannot be guaranteed in
practice due to the non-optimality of the optimization. Moreover, the
orthogonality constraint is also computationally expensive and might not be
effective. To address the problem, we introduce a new family of SW distances,
named Markovian sliced Wasserstein (MSW) distance, which imposes a first-order
Markov structure on projecting directions. We discuss various members of MSW by
specifying the Markov structure including the prior distribution, the
transition distribution, and the burning and thinning technique. Moreover, we
investigate the theoretical properties of MSW including topological properties
(metricity, weak convergence, and connection to other distances), statistical
properties (sample complexity, and Monte Carlo estimation error), and
computational properties (computational complexity and memory complexity).
Finally, we compare MSW distances with previous SW variants in various
applications such as gradient flows, color transfer, and deep generative
modeling to demonstrate the favorable performance of MSW.

We formulate the problem as a discrete time Markov decision process (MDP). We
propose a new algorithm, SAFFE, that makes fair allocations with respect to the
entire demands revealed over the horizon by accounting for expected future
demands at each arrival time. The algorithm introduces regularization which
enables the prioritization of current revealed demands over future potential
demands depending on the uncertainty in agents' future demands. Using the MDP
formulation, we show that SAFFE optimizes allocations based on an upper bound
on the Nash Social Welfare fairness objective, and we bound its gap to
optimality with the use of concentration bounds on total future demands. Using
synthetic and real data, we compare the performance of SAFFE against existing
approaches and a reinforcement learning policy trained on the MDP. We show that
SAFFE leads to more fair and efficient allocations and achieves
close-to-optimal performance in settings with dense arrivals.

scaling up, both in terms of model size and input context, introducing more
hidden and input neurons. While this generally improves performance on average,
the extra neurons do not yield a consistent improvement for all instances. This
is because some hidden neurons are redundant, and the noise mixed in input
neurons tends to distract the model. Previous work mainly focuses on
extrinsically reducing low-utility neurons by additional post- or
pre-processing, such as network pruning and context selection, to avoid this

suppress input noise by intrinsically enhancing the utility of each neuron? If
a model can efficiently utilize neurons, no matter which neurons are ablated

However, they may be unreliable for ``unseen"" inputs when the training dataset
is unrepresentative. Enhancing the representativeness of the training dataset
for NN solvers is indispensable but is not well studied in the literature. To
tackle this challenge, we propose an OPF solver based on a
physical-model-integrated NN with worth-learning data generation. The designed
NN is a combination of a conventional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and an
OPF-model module, which outputs not only the optimal decision variables of the
OPF problem but also the constraints violation degree. Based on this NN, the
worth-learning data generation method can identify feasible samples that are
not well generalized by the NN. By iteratively applying this method and
including the newly identified worth-learning samples in the training set, the
representativeness of the training set can be significantly enhanced.
Therefore, the solution reliability of the NN solver can be remarkably
improved. Experimental results show that the proposed method leads to an over
50% reduction of constraint violations and optimality loss compared to
conventional NN solvers.

has attracted intensive research interests recently. In this paper, we study a
novel Temporal k-Core Query (TCQ) problem: given a time interval, find all
distinct k-cores that exist within any subintervals from a temporal graph,
which generalizes the previous historical k-core query. This problem is
challenging because the number of subintervals increases quadratically to the
span of time interval. For that, we propose a novel Temporal Core Decomposition
(TCD) algorithm that decrementally induces temporal k-cores from the previously
induced ones and thus reduces ""intra-core"" redundant computation significantly.
Then, we introduce an intuitive concept named Tightest Time Interval (TTI) for
temporal k-core, and design an optimization technique with theoretical
guarantee that leverages TTI as a key to predict which subintervals will induce
duplicated k-cores and prunes the subintervals completely in advance, thereby
eliminating ""inter-core"" redundant computation. The complexity of optimized TCD
(OTCD) algorithm no longer depends on the span of query time interval but only
the scale of final results, which means OTCD algorithm is scalable. Moreover,
we propose a compact in-memory data structure named Temporal Edge List (TEL) to
implement OTCD algorithm efficiently in physical level with bounded memory
requirement. TEL organizes temporal edges in a ""timeline"" and can be updated
instantly when new edges arrive, and thus our approach can also deal with
dynamic temporal graphs. We compare OTCD algorithm with the incremental
historical k-core query on several real-world temporal graphs, and observe that
OTCD algorithm outperforms it by three orders of magnitude, even though OTCD
algorithm needs none precomputed index.

capable of producing high-quality talking head videos in synchronization with
the source audio, and more importantly, it can be naturally generalized across

determining the band topology. In general, for systems that possess inversion
symmetry, the Zak phase of an isolated band is quantized as 0 or Pi and is
associated with the spatial field symmetries at the Brillouin zone center and
boundary. The phase is Pi if the field symmetries are different but is 0 when
they are the same. Since the radiation losses from leaky systems are strongly
associated with the Bloch waves, one may probe the far-field continuum to
determine the Zak phases. Here, we formulate the diffractions from photonic

the Bloch wave symmetries and thereby the corresponding Zak phase. The field
symmetries also generalize the occurrence of bound states in the continuum at
high symmetry points. For verification, we have studied the Zak phases of

space-inversion (SI) and time-reversal (TR) symmetry breaking provides a unique
platform for the exploration of novel topological states. Here, by employing
electrical and thermoelectrical transport, angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES), high-pressure techniques, and band calculations, we
demonstrate that magnetism and pressure can serve as efficient parameters to
tune the positions of Weyl nodes in CeAlSi. At ambient pressure, an anomalous
Hall effect (AHE) and an anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) arise in the
paramagnetic state, and then are enhanced when temperature approaches the
ferromagnetic ordering temperature, evidencing magnetism facilitates the
AHE/ANE. Such an enhancement of AHE/ANE can be ascribed to the tuning of the
positions of Weyl nodes via magnetism. The ARPES measurements reveal that the
ferromagnetism serves as a pivotal knob to tune the band structure of CeAlSi
both in the bulk and on the surface. Such magnetism-tunable electronic
structure has hitherto not been reported in other magnetic $R$Al$Pn$ ($R$ =
rare earth elements, $Pn$ = Si, Ge) siblings, suggesting the great potential of
controlling Weyl node positions in CeAlSi. Under pressure, an enhancement and a
sign change of AHE are discovered. Based on band calculations, the evolution of
AHE may root in the tuning of Weyl nodes via pressure. Moreover, multiple
pressure-induced phase transitions are uncovered. These findings indicate that
CeAlSi provides a unique and tunable platform for exploring exotic topological
physics and electron correlations, as well as catering to an array of potential
applications, such as spintronics and thermoelectrics.

routes because of their tacit knowledge of the road and curbside
infrastructure, customer availability, and other characteristics of the
respective service areas. Hence, the actual stop sequences chosen by an
experienced human driver may be potentially preferable to the theoretical
shortest-distance routing under real-life operational conditions. Thus, being
able to predict the actual stop sequence that a human driver would follow can
help to improve route planning in last-mile delivery. This paper proposes a
pair-wise attention-based pointer neural network for this prediction task using
drivers' historical delivery trajectory data. In addition to the commonly used
encoder-decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence prediction, we propose a
new attention mechanism based on an alternative specific neural network to
capture the local pair-wise information for each pair of stops. To further
capture the global efficiency of the route, we propose a new iterative sequence
generation algorithm that is used after model training to identify the first
stop of a route that yields the lowest operational cost. Results from an
extensive case study on real operational data from Amazon's last-mile delivery
operations in the US show that our proposed method can significantly outperform
traditional optimization-based approaches and other machine learning methods
(such as the Long Short-Term Memory encoder-decoder and the original pointer
network) in finding stop sequences that are closer to high-quality routes
executed by experienced drivers in the field. Compared to benchmark models, the
proposed model can increase the average prediction accuracy of the first four
stops from around 0.2 to 0.312, and reduce the disparity between the predicted

algebraic approach where the starting point is an associative algebra with
involution and states are defined as positive linear functionals on this
algebra and on geometric approach where the starting point is a set of states
considered as a convex subset of linear space. The exposition does not depend
on textbooks in quantum mechanics. Standard formulas for quantum probabilities
are derived from decoherence. This derivation allows us to go beyond quantum
theory in geometric approach. Particles are defined as elementary excitations
of ground state (and quasiparticles as elementary excitations of any
translation invariant state). It follows from this definition that the notion
of identical particles is very natural. The scattering of particles is analyzed
in the framework of generalization of Haag-Ruelle theory. The conventional
scattering matrix does not work for quasiparticles (and even for particles if
the theory does not have particle interpretation). The analysis of scattering
in these cases is based on the notion of inclusive scattering matrix, closely
related to inclusive cross-sections. It is proven that the conventional
scattering matrix can be expressed in terms of Green functions (LSZ formula)
anf inclusive scattering matrix can be expressed in terms of generalized Green
functions that appear in the Keldysh formalism of non-equilibrium statistical
physics. It is shown that generalized Green functions and inclusive scattering
matrices appear also in the formalism of L-functionals that can be identified
with positive functionals on Weyl or Clifford algebras. The derivation of the
expression of the evolution operator and other physical quantities in terms of
functional integrals is based on the notion of symbol of operator; these
arguments can be applied also in geometric approach. This result can be used,
in particular, to give a simple derivation of diagram technique for generalized
Green functions. The notion of inclusive scattering matrix makes sense in
geometric approach (but it seems that one cannot give a definition of
conventional scattering matrix in this situation). The geometric approach is
used to show that quantum mechanics and its generalizations can be considered
as classical theories where our devices are able to measure only a part of
observables. This text is based on first ten lectures of the course taught by

BECs are even modulationally unstable and this tendency towards MI increases
with increasing impurity fraction and superfluid-impurity coupling strength.
However, the tendency of a given BEC towards the MI decreases with the
decreasing mass of the impurity atoms while the sign of the superfluid-impurity
interaction plays no role. The above results are true even for attractive BECs

as a commutative algebra $A:={\mathcal P} (P, \, Q )$ satisfying a certain
universal property. The universal algebra is shown to exist for any finite
dimensional Poisson algebra $P$ and several of its applications are
highlighted. For any Poisson $P$-module $U$, we construct a functor $U \otimes
- \colon {}_{A} {\mathcal M} \to {}_Q{\mathcal P}{\mathcal M}$ from the
category of $A$-modules to the category of Poisson $Q$-modules which has a left
adjoint whenever $U$ is finite dimensional. Similarly, if $V$ is an $A$-module,
then there exists another functor $ - \otimes V \colon {}_P{\mathcal
P}{\mathcal M} \to {}_Q{\mathcal P}{\mathcal M}$ connecting the categories of
Poisson representations of $P$ and $Q$ and the latter functor also admits a
left adjoint if $V$ is finite dimensional. If $P$ is $n$-dimensional, then
${\mathcal P} (P) := {\mathcal P} (P, \, P)$ is the initial object in the
category of all commutative bialgebras coacting on $P$. As an algebra,
${\mathcal P} (P)$ can be deescribed as the quotient of the polynomial algebra
$k[X_{ij} \, | \, i, j = 1, \cdots, n]$ through an ideal generated by $2 n^3$
non-homogeneous polynomials of degree $\leq 2$. Two applications are provided.
The first one describes the automorphisms group ${\rm Aut}_{\rm Poiss} (P)$ as
the group of all invertible group-like elements of the finite dual ${\mathcal
P} (P)^{\rm o}$. Secondly, we show that for an abelian group $G$, all
$G$-gradings on $P$ can be explicitly described and classified in terms of the
universal coacting bialgebra ${\mathcal P} (P)$.

  Approach with Panel Effects Across Days",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Understanding passengers' path choice behavior in urban rail systems is a
prerequisite for effective operations and planning. This paper attempts
bridging the gap by proposing a probabilistic approach to infer passengers'
path choice behavior in urban rail systems using a large-scale smart card data.
The model uses latent classes and panel effects to capture passengers' implicit
behavior heterogeneity and longitudinal correlations, key research gaps in big
data driven behavior studies. We formulate the probability of each individual's
arrival time at a destination based on their path choice behavior, and estimate
corresponding path choice model parameters as a maximum likelihood estimation
problem. The original likelihood function is intractable due to the exponential
computation complexity. We derive a tractable likelihood function and propose a
numerical integral approach to efficiently estimate the model. Also, we propose
a method to calculate the t-statistic of the estimated choice parameters based
on the numerically estimated Hessian matrix and Cramer-Rao bound (the lower
bound on the coefficient variance). Case studies using synthetic data validate
the model performance and its robustness against parameter initialization and
input errors, and highlight the importance of incorporating crowding impact in
path choice estimation. Applications using actual data from the Mass Transit
Railway, Hong Kong reveal two latent groups of passengers: time-sensitive (TS)
and comfort-aware (CA). TS passengers are those who are more likely to choose
paths with short travel times. Most of them are regular commuters with high
travel frequency and less schedule flexibility. CA passengers care more about
the travel comfort experience and choose paths with less walking and waiting
times. The proposed approach is data-driven and general to accommodate other
discrete choice structures.

objects, including their masses, distances, and proper motions through
calculating Fisher and Covariance matrices. Since the ~2.3-year time gap
between Roman's first three observing seasons and the others may lower the
efficiency of realizing microlensing events and characterizing ISMBHs, we
additionally consider a scenario where we add a small amount of additional
observations -- one hour of observations every 10 days when the Bulge is
observable during the large time gap -- which is equivalent to a total of about
one additional day of observations with the Roman telescope. These extra
observations increase Roman's efficiency for characterizing ISMBHs by ~$1-2\%$

possible degenerate solutions. By considering uniform, and power-law mass
functions ($dN/dM ~ M^{-\alpha}$, $\alpha=2,~1,~0.5$) for ISMBHs in the range

high dimensional and nonconvex with discrete constraints. To tackle this
problem, a back propagation based phase design scheme for both continuous and

tackled using the Bayesian method with the factor graph technique, where the
problem is represented by a graph model which consists of difficult local

obscure the fluorescence emissions from Chls and BChls. We found that
BChl-based fluorescence for wavelengths of 1000-1100 nm, assuming the spectrum
of BChl b-bearing purple bacteria, could provide a suitable biosignature but
only in the absence of the water cloud coverage or other strong absorbers near
1000 nm. The Chl fluorescence is weaker for several reasons, e.g., spectral
blending with the VRE. The apparent reflectance excess is greatly increased in
both Chl and BChl cases around TRAPPIST-1 due to fluorescence and stellar
absorption lines. This could be a promising feature for detecting the
fluorescence around ultracool red dwarfs by follow-up ground-based observations
with high spectral resolution; however, it requires a long time around Sun-like

formation. Yet, only formulae for single-sized (monodisperse) distribution have
been derived in the literature. These can lead to significant underestimates
for Bondi accretion, for which the best accreted pebble size may not be the one
that dominates the mass distribution. We derive in this paper the polydisperse
theory of pebble accretion. We consider a power-law distribution in pebble
radius, and we find the resulting surface and volume number density
distribution functions. We derive also the exact monodisperse analytical pebble
accretion rate for which 3D and 2D accretion are limits. In addition, we find
analytical solutions to the polydisperse 2D Hill and 3D Bondi limits. We
integrate the polydisperse pebble accretion numerically for the MRN
distribution, finding a slight decrease (by an exact factor 3/7) in the Hill
regime compared to the monodisperse case. In contrast, in the Bondi regime, we
find 1-2 orders of magnitude higher accretion rates compared to monodisperse,
also extending the onset of pebble accretion to 1-2 order of magnitude lower in
mass. We find Myr-timescales, within the disk lifetime, for Bondi accretion on
top of planetary seeds of masses $10^{-6}-10^{-4} M_\oplus$, over a significant
range of the parameter space. This mass range overlaps with the high mass end
of the planetesimal initial mass function, and thus pebble accretion is
possible directly following formation by streaming instability. This alleviates
the need for mutual planetesimal collisions as a major contribution to
planetary growth.

neural networks can learn domain invariant features to reduce the shift between
source and target domains. While such adversarial approaches achieve
domain-level alignment, they ignore the class (label) shift. When
class-conditional data distributions are significantly different between the
source and target domain, it can generate ambiguous features near class
boundaries that are more likely to be misclassified. In this work, we propose a
two-stage model for domain adaptation called \textbf{C}ontrastive-adversarial
\textbf{D}omain \textbf{A}daptation \textbf{(CDA)}. While the adversarial
component facilitates domain-level alignment, two-stage contrastive learning
exploits class information to achieve higher intra-class compactness across
domains resulting in well-separated decision boundaries. Furthermore, the
proposed contrastive framework is designed as a plug-and-play module that can
be easily embedded with existing adversarial methods for domain adaptation. We
conduct experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets for domain
adaptation, namely, \textit{Office-31} and \textit{Digits-5}, and demonstrate
that CDA achieves state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

that one cannot split the CEE into one stage during which the companion

slower phase when the companion orbits the initial envelope radiative zone and
a stable mass transfer takes place. At best, this might take place when the

video frame. To this end, many works dedicate to integrate diverse information
from consecutive frames to enhance the features for prediction, where a feature
alignment procedure via estimated optical flow is usually required. However,
the optical flow would inevitably suffer from inaccuracy, and then introduce
noises in feature fusion and further result in unsatisfactory segmentation
results. In this paper, to tackle the misalignment issue, we propose a
spatial-temporal fusion (STF) module to model dense pairwise relationships
among multi-frame features. Different from previous methods, STF uniformly and
adaptively fuses features at different spatial and temporal positions, and
avoids error-prone optical flow estimation. Besides, we further exploit feature
refinement within a single frame and propose a novel memory-augmented
refinement (MAR) module to tackle difficult predictions among semantic
boundaries. Specifically, MAR can store the boundary features and prototypes
extracted from the training samples, which together form the task-specific
memory, and then use them to refine the features during inference. Essentially,
MAR can move the hard features closer to the most likely category and thus make
them more discriminative. We conduct extensive experiments on Cityscapes and
CamVid, and the results show that our proposed methods significantly outperform
previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Code and

PDF analysis using this model, we show that the synthesis method can yield two
types of low-temperature stacking structures: a completely disordered stacking

transition temperature of the former sample is about 15 K lower than that of
the latter. We discuss that this is due to the strong trimer frustration that
appears in the sample without short-range order, which suppresses the phase
transition temperature, similar to the frustration effect in conventional spin

  modeling",,,,,"q-bio.GN cs.OH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Motivation: Detection of structural variants (SV) from the alignment of
sample DNA reads to the reference genome is an important problem in
understanding human diseases. Long reads that can span repeat regions, along
with an accurate alignment of these long reads play an important role in
identifying novel SVs. Long read sequencers such as nanopore sequencing can
address this problem by providing very long reads but with high error rates,
making accurate alignment challenging. Many errors induced by nanopore
sequencing have a bias because of the physics of the sequencing process and
proper utilization of these error characteristics can play an important role in
designing a robust aligner for SV detection problems. In this paper, we design
and evaluate HQAlign, an aligner for SV detection using nanopore sequenced
reads. The key ideas of HQAlign include (i) using basecalled nanopore reads
along with the nanopore physics to improve alignments for SVs (ii)
incorporating SV specific changes to the alignment pipeline (iii) adapting
these into existing state-of-the-art long read aligner pipeline, minimap2
(v2.24), for efficient alignments.
  Results: We show that HQAlign captures about 4%-6% complementary SVs across
different datasets which are missed by minimap2 alignments while having a
standalone performance at par with minimap2 for real nanopore reads data. For
the common SV calls between HQAlign and minimap2, HQAlign improves the start
and the end breakpoint accuracy for about 10%-50% of SVs across different
datasets. Moreover, HQAlign improves the alignment rate to 89.35% from minimap2
85.64% for nanopore reads alignment to recent telomere-to-telomere CHM13
assembly, and it improves to 86.65% from 83.48% for nanopore reads alignment to

constructing a complete metric space $X$ with a conical bicombing $\sigma$ such
that there is a finite subset of $X$ whose closed $\sigma$-convex hull is
non-compact. In $\text{CAT}(0)$-geometry, the analogous statement is an open
question, i.e. it is not known whether closed convex hulls of finite subsets of
complete $\text{CAT}(0)$ space are compact or not. This question goes back to
Gromov. Our result shows that to obtain a positive answer to Gromov's question,
more than just the convexity properties of the metric must be used. The
constructed space $X$ has the additional property that there is an integer $n$
such that it is an initial object in the category of convex hulls of $n$-point
sets. Thus, roughly speaking, $X$ can be thought of as the largest possible
convex hull of $n$ points.

to generalize to an unknown test-time distribution in which the spurious
correlations do not hold anymore. Debiasing methods were developed to make
networks robust to such spurious biases but require to know in advance if a
dataset is biased and make heavy use of minority counterexamples that do not
display the majority bias of their class. In this paper, we argue that such
samples should not be necessarily needed because the ''hidden'' causal
information is often also contained in biased images. To study this idea, we
propose 3 publicly released synthetic classification benchmarks, exhibiting
predictive classification shortcuts, each of a different and challenging
nature, without any minority samples acting as counterexamples. First, we
investigate the effectiveness of several state-of-the-art strategies on our
benchmarks and show that they do not yield satisfying results on them. Then, we
propose an architecture able to succeed on our benchmarks, despite their
unusual properties, using an entropic adversarial data augmentation training
scheme. An encoder-decoder architecture is tasked to produce images that are
not recognized by a classifier, by maximizing the conditional entropy of its
outputs, and keep as much as possible of the initial content. A precise control
of the information destroyed, via a disentangling process, enables us to remove
the shortcut and leave everything else intact. Furthermore, results competitive
with the state-of-the-art on the BAR dataset ensure the applicability of our
method in real-life situations.

LCS data in a mobile setting? Which factors most significantly contribute to
differences between mobile LCS data and higher-quality instruments? Can data
from LCS be used to identify hotspots and generate generalizable pollutant
concentration maps? To help address these questions we deployed low-cost PM2.5
sensors (Alphasense OPC-N3) and a research-grade instrument (TSI DustTrak) in a
mobile laboratory in Boston, MA, USA. We first collocated these instruments
with stationary PM2.5 reference monitors at nearby regulatory sites. Next,
using the reference measurements, we developed different models to correct the
OPC-N3 and DustTrak measurements, and then transferred the corrections to the
mobile setting. We observed that more complex correction models appeared to
perform better than simpler models in the stationary setting; however, when
transferred to the mobile setting, corrected OPC-N3 measurements agreed less
well with corrected DustTrak data. In general, corrections developed using
minute-level collocation measurements transferred better to the mobile setting
than corrections developed using hourly-averaged data. Mobile laboratory speed,
OPC-N3 orientation relative to the direction of travel, date, hour-of-the-day,

applications such as oscillator-based neuromorphic computing and Ising machines
where larger N can tackle larger problems. Here we fabricate spin Hall
nano-oscillator chains of up to 50 serially connected nano-constrictions in

heuristic algorithms, which often do not provide any guarantees on the quality

interesting target for pulsar searches, because of its multiple stellar
populations and the intriguing possibility that it was once the nucleus of a

in this globular cluster and their association with known X-ray sources was a
hint that, given the large number of known X-ray sources, there is a much
larger undiscovered pulsar population. We used the superior sensitivity of the
MeerKAT radio telescope to search for pulsars in Omega Centauri. In this paper,
we present some of the first results of this survey, including the discovery of
13 new pulsars; the total number of known pulsars in this cluster currently
stands at 18. At least half of them are in binary systems and preliminary
orbital constraints suggest that most of the binaries have light companions. We
also discuss the ratio between isolated and binaries pulsars and how they were
formed in this cluster.

to the distribution function, but this approach is not suited to construct
models with a preset density profile and it imposes unphysical constraints on
the orbit population. We investigate whether it is possible to construct simple
dynamical models for spherical systems with a preset density profile with a
finite extent, and ideally with a different range of orbital structures. We
systematically investigate the consistency of radially truncated dynamical
models, and demonstrate that no spherical models with a discontinuous density
truncation can be supported by an ergodic orbital structure. On the other hand,
we argue that many radially truncated models can be supported by a tangential
Osipkov-Merritt orbital structure that becomes completely tangential at the
truncation radius. We formulate a consistency hypothesis for radially truncated
models with such an orbital structure, and test it using an analytical example
and the numerical exploration of a large model parameter space using the
SpheCow code. We physically interpret our results in terms of the occupancy of

probed by the sudden change of the tail of the topological charge distribution

research has seen a significant effort around black-box recommender based
approaches such as Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). These advances have led,
together with the increasing concerns around users' data collection and
privacy, to a strong interest in building responsible recommender systems. A
key element of a successful music recommender system is modelling how users
interact with streamed content. By first understanding these interactions,
insights can be drawn to enable the construction of more transparent and
responsible systems. An example of these interactions is skipping behaviour, a
signal that can measure users' satisfaction, dissatisfaction, or lack of
interest. In this paper, we study the utility of users' historical data for the
task of sequentially predicting users' skipping behaviour. To this end, we
adapt DRL for this classification task, followed by a post-hoc explainability
(SHAP) and ablation analysis of the input state representation. Experimental
results from a real-world music streaming dataset (Spotify) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in this task by outperforming state-of-the-art
models. A comprehensive analysis of our approach and of users' historical data
reveals a temporal data leakage problem in the dataset. Our findings indicate
that, overall, users' behaviour features are the most discriminative in how our
proposed DRL model predicts music skips. Content and contextual features have a
lesser effect. This suggests that a limited amount of user data should be
collected and leveraged to predict skipping behaviour.

demonstrations, as they offer an arbitrarily precise estimation of global and
local tallies while making very few assumptions. However, since the inception
of such numerical approaches, it is well known that bias might affect both the
estimation of errors on these tallies and the tallies themselves. In
particular, stochastic modeling approaches developed in the past decade have
shed light on the prominent role played by spatial correlations through a
phenomenon called neutron clustering. This effect is particularly of great
significance when simulating loosely coupled systems (i.e., with a high
dominance ratio). In order to tackle this problem, this paper proposes to
recast the power iteration technique of Monte Carlo criticality codes into a
variance reduction technique called Adaptative Multilevel Splitting. The
central idea is that iterating over neutron generations can be seen as pushing
a sub-population of neutrons towards a generational detector (instead of a
spatial detector as variance reduction techniques usually do). While both
approaches allow for neutron population control, the former blindly removes or
splits neutrons. In contrast, the latter optimizes spatial, generational, and
spectral attributes of neutrons when they are removed or split through an
adjoint flux estimation, hence tempering both generational and spatial
correlations. This is illustrated in the present article with a simple case of
a bare slab reactor in the one speed theory on which the Adaptive Multilevel
Splitting was applied and compared to variations of the Monte Carlo power
iteration method used in neutron transport. Besides looking at the resulting
efficiency of the methods, this work also aims at highlighting the main
mechanisms of the Adaptive Multilevel Splitting in criticality calculations.

the gravitational Standard-Model Extension (SME). Our analysis rests upon the
Hubble tension (HT), which is a discrepancy between the observational
determination of the Hubble parameter via data from the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae, respectively. While the latter
approach is model-independent, the former highly depends on the model used to
describe the physics of the early Universe. Motivated by the HT, we take into
account two recently introduced cosmological models as test frameworks of the
pre-CMB era. These settings involve local Lorentz and diffeomorphism violation
parameterized by nondynamical SME background fields $s_{00}$ and $s^{ij}$,
respectively. We aim at explaining the tension in the measured results of the
cosmic expansion rate in early and late epochs by resorting to these two
modified cosmologies as potential descriptions of the pre-CMB era. As long as
the HT does not turn out to be a merely systematic effect, it can serve as a
criterion for exploring regions of the parameter space in certain pre-CMB
new-physics candidates such as SME cosmologies. By setting extracted limits on
SME coefficients into perspective with already existing bounds in the
literature, we infer that none of the aforementioned models are suitable
pre-CMB candidates for fixing the HT. In this way, new physics arising from the
particular realizations of Lorentz and diffeomorphism violation studied in this
paper does not explain the HT. Our paper exemplifies how to exploit this
discrepancy as a novel possibility of refining our description of the early
Universe.

reinforcement learning. Compared with the actor-critic framework, the director
role is added, and action classification and action evaluation are applied
simultaneously to improve the decision-making performance of the agent.
Firstly, the actions of the agent are divided into high quality actions and low
quality actions according to the rewards returned from the environment. Then,
the director network is trained to have the ability to discriminate high and
low quality actions and guide the actor network to reduce the repetitive
exploration of low quality actions in the early stage of training. In addition,
we propose an improved double estimator method to better solve the problem of
overestimation in the field of reinforcement learning. For the two critic
networks used, we design two target critic networks for each critic network
instead of one. In this way, the target value of each critic network can be
calculated by taking the average of the outputs of the two target critic
networks, which is more stable and accurate than using only one target critic
network to obtain the target value. In order to verify the performance of the

applied them to the TD3 algorithm to improve the TD3 algorithm. Then, we
carried out experiments in multiple environments in MuJoCo and compared the

digital beamforming for interference mitigation. Then, to establish appropriate

algorithm which determines the connections according to the total spectral
efficiency (SE) increment of the multi-satellite cooperative network. Next, a
joint hybrid beamforming and user scheduling scheme is proposed to dramatically
improve the performance of the multi-satellite cooperative network. Moreover,

the pseudo-first-order kinetics. The rate constants for the reaction catalyzed

several observational tensions arising within the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark
matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario. Different DDE models, parameterized by
different combinations of the local value of the equation-of-state parameter
$w_0$ and its time derivative $w_a$, predict different maximal abundance of
massive galaxies in the early Universe. We use the observed abundance of
massive galaxies already in place at z>=4.5 to constrain DDE models. To this
aim, we consider four independent probes: (i) the observed stellar mass
function at z~6 from the CANDELS survey; (ii) the estimated volume density of
massive haloes derived from the observation of massive, star-forming galaxies
detected in the submillimeter range at z~5; (iii) the rareness of the most
massive system detected at z~7 by the SPT survey; (iv) the abundance of massive
(M>10^10.5 Msun) galaxies at z~10 as inferred from early JWST observations. Our
probes exclude a major fraction of the DDE parameter space that is allowed by
other existing probes. In particular, early JWST results, if confirmed, are in
tension with the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario at a 2$\sigma$ confidence
level.

diminish with decreasing heliographic distance. Fast streams are observed to
roughly retain their near-Sun anisotropic properties, with the observed
spectral index and power anisotropies being more consistent with a
``dynamically aligned'' type of cascade, though the lack of extended fast-wind

that overwhelm the capacity of branch target buffers (BTB) and instruction
caches (L1-I), causing frequent front-end stalls that inevitably hurt
performance. BTB capacity is crucial for performance as a sufficiently large
BTB enables the front-end to accurately resolve the upcoming execution path and
steer instruction fetch appropriately. Moreover, it also enables highly
effective fetch-directed instruction prefetching that can eliminate a large
portion L1-I misses. For these reasons, commercial processors allocate vast
amounts of storage capacity to BTBs.
  This work aims to reduce BTB storage requirements by optimizing the
organization of BTB entries. Our key insight is that storing branch target
offsets, instead of full or compressed targets, can drastically reduce BTB
storage cost as the vast majority of dynamic branches have short offsets
requiring just a handful of bits to encode. Based on this insight, we size the
ways of a set associative BTB to hold different number of target offset bits
such that each way stores offsets within a particular range. Doing so enables a
dramatic reduction in storage for target addresses. Our final design, called
BTB-X, uses an 8-way set associative BTB with differently sized ways that
enables it to track about 2.24x more branches than a conventional BTB and 1.3x
more branches than a storage-optimized state-of-the-art BTB organization,
called PDede, with the same storage budget.

$v$ with respect to this ordering is the number of edges from any vertex before

an ordering is the maximum cutwidth of any vertex with respect to this
ordering. We are interested in finding the cutwidth of a graph, that is, the
minimum cutwidth over all orderings, which is an NP-hard problem. In order to
approximate the cutwidth of a given graph, we present a semidefinite
relaxation. We identify several classes of valid inequalities and equalities
that we use to strengthen the semidefinite relaxation. These classes are on the
one hand the well-known 3-dicycle equations and the triangle inequalities and
on the other hand we obtain inequalities from the squared linear ordering
polytope and via lifting the linear ordering polytope. The solution of the
semidefinite program serves to obtain a lower bound and also to construct a
feasible solution and thereby having an upper bound on the cutwidth.
  In order to evaluate the quality of our bounds, we perform numerical
experiments on graphs of different sizes and densities. It turns out that we
produce high quality bounds for graphs of medium size independent of their
density in reasonable time. Compared to that, obtaining bounds for dense
instances of the same quality is out of reach for solvers using integer linear

up-type quark (either up or charm) and a light scalar particle $X$ decaying
into a bottom anti-bottom quark pair is presented. The search focuses on
top-quark pair production where one top quark decays to $qX$, with $X
\rightarrow b\bar{b}$, and the other top quark decays according to the Standard
Model, with the $W$ boson decaying leptonically. The final state is thus
characterised by an isolated electron or muon and at least four jets. Events
are categorised according to the multiplicity of jets and jets tagged as
originating from $b$-quarks, and a neural network is used to discriminate
between signal and background processes. The data analysed correspond to 139
fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV,
recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The 95% confidence-level upper
limits between 0.019% and 0.062% are derived for the branching fraction
$\mathcal{B}$($t \rightarrow uX$) and between 0.018% and 0.078% for the

TinyML-class training as opposed to inference only. Current training
algorithms, based on various forms of error and gradient backpropagation, rely
on floating-point matrix operations to meet the precision and dynamic range
requirements. So far, the energy and power cost of these operations has been
considered too high for TinyML scenarios. This paper addresses the open
challenge of near-sensor training on a few mW power budget and presents RedMulE
- Reduced-Precision Matrix Multiplication Engine, a low-power specialized
accelerator conceived for multi-precision floating-point General Matrix-Matrix
Operations (GEMM-Ops) acceleration, supporting FP16, as well as hybrid FP8
formats, with {sign, exponent, mantissa}=({1,4,3}, {1,5,2}). We integrate
RedMule into a Parallel Ultra-Low-Power (PULP) cluster containing eight
energy-efficient RISC-V cores sharing a tightly-coupled data memory and
implement the resulting system in a 22 nm technology. At its best efficiency
point (@ 470 MHz, 0.65 V), the RedMulE-augmented PULP cluster achieves 755
GFLOPS/W and 920 GFLOPS/W during regular General Matrix-Matrix Multiplication
(GEMM), and up to 1.19 TFLOPS/W and 1.67 TFLOPS/W when executing GEMM-Ops,
respectively, for FP16 and FP8 input/output tensors. In its best performance
point (@ 613 MHz, 0.8 V), RedMulE achieves up to 58.5 GFLOPS and 117 GFLOPS for
FP16 and FP8, respectively, with 99.4% utilization of the array of Computing
Elements and consuming less than 60 mW on average, thus enabling on-device
training of deep learning models in TinyML application scenarios while
retaining the flexibility to tackle other classes of common linear algebra
problems efficiently.

with high granularity, high hit-rate capability, fast response time and
superior radiation tolerance. The small pixel size ($36.4\times
36.4$~$\mu$m$^2$) provides high spatial resolution. Its asynchronous readout
architecture is designed for high hit-rates and fast time response in triggered

stream all hit data to the multi-channel output which allows an off-sensor
trigger formation and the use of hit-time information for event tagging.
  The sensor manufacturing has been optimised through process adaptation and
special implant designs to allow the manufacturing of small electrode DMAPS on
thick high-resistivity p-type Czochralski substrate. The special processing
ensures excellent charge collection and charge particle detection efficiency
even after a high level of radiation. Furthermore the special implant design
and use of a Czochralski substrate improves the sensor's time resolution. This
paper presents a summary of sensor design optimisation through process and
implant choices and TCAD simulation to model the signal response. Beam and
laboratory test results on unirradiated and irradiated sensors have shown
excellent detection efficiency after a dose of $2\times10^{15}$ 1 MeV

Gaussian distributions in kinetic variables (velocity, momentum), as it shows
mathematically that, in the absence of any other dynamic mechanisms, almost
Gaussian distributions stems from the low-velocity approximations of the

AI systems are becoming increasingly common in real-world applications,
especially in fields related to human decision-making, and its interpretability
is necessary. However, there are still relatively few standard methods for
assessing and addressing the interpretability of machine learning-based systems
in real-world applications. In this study, we examine the framework of a video

identified a new SdH frequency of 0.39 kT. The increased SNR allowed resistance
fluctuation (noise) spectroscopy that would not be possible for bulk crystals,

thin microstructured samples exhibited a large increase of T_N from 67 mK up to
188 mK while still showing clear signatures of the phase transition and SdH

that it can be used to not only virtually replicate a system's detailed

various fields, such as smart manufacturing and transportation, its
conventional paradigm is limited to embody non-living entities, e.g., robots
and vehicles. When adopted in human-centric systems, a novel concept, called
human digital twin (HDT) has thus been proposed. Particularly, HDT allows in
silico representation of individual human body with the ability to dynamically
reflect molecular status, physiological status, emotional and psychological
status, as well as lifestyle evolutions. These prompt the expected application
of HDT in personalized healthcare (PH), which can facilitate remote monitoring,
diagnosis, prescription, surgery and rehabilitation. However, despite the large
potential, HDT faces substantial research challenges in different aspects, and
becomes an increasingly popular topic recently. In this survey, with a specific
focus on the networking architecture and key technologies for HDT in PH
applications, we first discuss the differences between HDT and conventional
DTs, followed by the universal framework and essential functions of HDT. We
then analyze its design requirements and challenges in PH applications. After
that, we provide an overview of the networking architecture of HDT, including
data acquisition layer, data communication layer, computation layer, data
management layer and data analysis and decision making layer. Besides reviewing
the key technologies for implementing such networking architecture in detail,
we conclude this survey by presenting future research directions of HDT.

important transition entropy change $\Delta s_t$ exists so far for
Ni(-Co)-Mn-Ti. Here, we present a systematic study analyzing the composition
and temperature dependence of $\Delta s_t$. Our results reveal a substantial
structural entropy change contribution of approximately 65 J(kgK)$^{-1}$, which
is compensated at lower temperatures by an increasingly negative entropy change
associated with the magnetic subsystem. This leads to compensation temperatures
$T_{comp}$ of 75 K and 300 K in Ni$_{35}$Co$_{15}$Mn$_{50-y}$Ti$_{y}$ and
Ni$_{33}$Co$_{17}$Mn$_{50-y}$Ti$_{y}$, respectively, below which the
martensitic transformations are arrested. In addition, we simultaneously
measured the responses of the magnetic, structural and electronic subsystems to
the temperature- and field-induced martensitic transformation near $T_{comp}$,
showing an abnormal increase of hysteresis and consequently dissipation energy
at cryogenic temperatures. Simultaneous measurements of magnetization and
adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{ad}$ in pulsed magnetic fields reveal a
change in sign of $\Delta T_{ad}$ and a substantial positive and irreversible
$\Delta T_{ad}$ up to 15 K at 15 K as a consequence of increased dissipation
losses and decreased heat capacity. Most importantly, this phenomenon is
universal, it applies to any first-order material with non-negligible

the atomic scale and its development during the thin film deposition is a
matter of major scientific interests. The development of stress is a complex
phenomenon and has a complex dependence to process parameters, film
microstructure and its morphology. In this work, by utilizing a custom-designed
cathodic arc deposition system and synchrotron radiation based 2D x-ray
diffraction (XRD) technique, we determine the real-time evolution of stress,
crystallite sizes and their preferential orientations of
Aluminum-Titanium-Nitride (AlxTi1-xN) films with varied Al-content (x=0.0,
0.25, 0.50, and 0.67) on Si-100 substrate. The energies of incoming ions and
hence stress in the films is tuned by applying different direct current
substrate bias (Vs = floating potential, -20, -40, -60, -80, and -100 V). The
instantaneous stress is evaluated by the well-known d vs. sin2{\psi} technique,
while crystallite sizes are determined by analyzing line profiles of x-ray
diffractograms. The evolution of stress and crystallite sizes are modelled with
multiple numerical models from which kinetic parameters associated with the
thin film depositions are extracted. The ex-situ microstructure
characterizations of AlxTi1-xN coatings are carried out by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The formation of
ex-situ microstructure of the films is discussed considering the results
obtained from in-situ XRD data. Finally, we demonstrate that the method
utilized here is a powerful approach towards estimation of the fracture

contradicts conventional wisdom. Furthermore, we identify two effects, a

absence of real measurements for a real-suburban German DN, the algorithms are
developed and evaluated over synthetic data using a digital twin. To utilize
strongly correlated measurements, the DN is clustered into zones. We observe
those reference measurements located in the same zone as the single-phase
consumer leads to accurate prediction of DN phases. Four consensus algorithms
are developed and compared. Using numerical results, we recommend the most
robust phase identification mechanism. In our evaluation, measurement error,
and the impact of the neutral conductor are also assessed. We assume limited DN
observability and apply our findings to a German DN without smart meters, but
only less than 8% of nodes have measurement boxes along with single-phase

single-phase consumers in a German DN can be identified. Further, we also
propose metrics quantifying the goodness of the phase identification. The phase
identification framework based on consensus algorithms for DN zones is scalable
for large DN and robust towards measurement errors as the estimation is not

However, a
simple simulation, even for an extremely high number of simulated miles or

does indeed cover a large fraction of the relevant real-world situations. In
addition, the validation must concern not only incidents, but also the
detection of any type of potentially dangerous situation, such as traffic
violations.
  We investigate a rigorous simulation and testing-based validation method for
autonomous driving systems that integrates an existing industrial simulator and
a formally defined testing environment. The environment includes a scenario
generator that drives the simulation process and a monitor that checks at
runtime the observed behavior of the system against a set of system properties
to be validated. The validation method consists in extracting from the
simulator a semantic model of the simulated system including a metric graph,
which is a mathematical model of the environment in which the vehicles of the
system evolve. The monitor can verify properties formalized in a first-order
linear temporal logic and provide diagnostics explaining their non
satisfaction. Instead of exploring the system behavior randomly as many
simulators do, we propose a method to systematically generate sets of scenarios
that cover potentially risky situations, especially for different types of
junctions where specific traffic rules must be respected. We show that the
systematic exploration of risky situations has uncovered many flaws in the real
simulator that would have been very difficult to discover by a random
exploration process.

  foils",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The hydrodynamic influence of surface texture on static surfaces ranges from
large drag penalties (roughness) to potential performance benefits (shark-like
skin). Although, it is of wide-ranging research interest, the impact of
roughness on flapping systems has received limited attention. In this work, we
explore the effect of roughness on unsteady performance of a harmonically
pitching foil through experiments using foils with different surface roughness,
at a fixed Strouhal number and within the Reynolds number (Re) range of
15k-30k. The foils' surface roughness is altered by changing the distribution
of spherical-cap shaped elements over the propulsor area. We find that the
addition of surface roughness does not improve the performance compared to a
smooth surface over the Re range considered. The analysis of the flow fields
shows near identical wakes regardless of the foil's surface roughness. The
performance reduction mainly occurs due to an increase in profile drag.
However, we find that the drag penalty due to roughness is reduced from 76% for
a static foil to 16% for a flapping foil at the same mean angle of attack, with
the strongest decrease measured at the highest Re. Our findings highlight that
the effect of roughness on dynamic systems is very different than that on
static systems, thereby, cannot be accounted for by only using information
obtained from static cases. This also indicates that the performance of
unsteady, flapping systems is more robust to the changes in surface roughness.

  Forensics And Security (TIFS 2022)",,,,"cs.CR cs.PL cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Blockchain smart contracts have given rise to a variety of interesting and
compelling applications and emerged as a revolutionary force for the Internet.
Quite a few practitioners have devoted themselves to developing tools for
detecting bugs in smart contracts. One line of efforts revolve around static
analysis techniques, which heavily suffer from high false-positive rates.
Another line of works concentrate on fuzzing techniques. Unfortunately, current
fuzzing approaches for smart contracts tend to conduct fuzzing starting from
the initial state of the contract, which expends too much energy revolving
around the initial state and thus is usually unable to unearth bugs triggered
by other states. Moreover, most existing methods treat each branch equally,
failing to take care of the branches that are rare or more likely to possess
bugs. This might lead to resources wasted on normal branches. In this paper, we
try to tackle these challenges from three aspects: (1) In generating function
invocation sequences, we explicitly consider data dependencies between
functions to facilitate exploring richer states. We further prolong a function
invocation sequence S1 by appending a new sequence S2, so that S2 can start
fuzzing from states that are different from the initial state. (2) We
incorporate a branch distance-based measure to evolve test cases iteratively
towards a target branch. (3) We engage a branch search algorithm to discover
rare and vulnerable branches, and design an energy allocation mechanism to take
care of exercising these crucial branches. We implement IR-Fuzz and extensively
evaluate it over 12K real-world contracts. Empirical results show that: (i)
IR-Fuzz achieves 28% higher branch coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzing
approaches, and (ii) IR-Fuzz detects more vulnerabilities and increases the
average accuracy of vulnerability detection by 7% over current methods.

up-to-date vulnerability databases which are maintained by security
researchers. These databases record the libraries related to each

library and human analysis is required to determine all the relevant libraries.
Human analysis may be slow and expensive, which motivates the need for
automated approaches. Researchers and practitioners have proposed to
automatically identify libraries from vulnerability reports using extreme
multi-label learning (XML).
  While state-of-the-art XML techniques showed promising performance, their
experiment settings do not practically fit what happens in reality. Previous
studies randomly split the vulnerability reports data for training and testing
their models without considering the chronological order of the reports. This
may unduly train the models on chronologically newer reports while testing the
models on chronologically older ones. However, in practice, one often receives
chronologically new reports, which may be related to previously unseen
libraries. Under this practical setting, we observe that the performance of
current XML techniques declines substantially, e.g., F1 decreased from 0.7 to
0.24 under experiments without and with consideration of chronological order of
vulnerability reports.
  We propose a practical library identification approach, namely CHRONOS, based
on zero-shot learning. The novelty of CHRONOS is three-fold. First, CHRONOS
fits into the practical pipeline by considering the chronological order of
vulnerability reports. Second, CHRONOS enriches the data of the vulnerability
descriptions and labels using a carefully designed data enhancement step.

demanding. However, selective harvesting of strawberries is complicated forming
a few scientific research questions. Most available solutions only deal with a
specific picking scenario, e.g., picking only a single variety of fruit in
isolation. Nonetheless, most economically viable (e.g. high-yielding and/or
disease-resistant) varieties of strawberry are grown in dense clusters. The
current perception technology in such use cases is inefficient. In this work,
we developed a novel system capable of harvesting strawberries with several
unique features. The features allow the system to deal with very complex
picking scenarios, e.g. dense clusters. Our concept of a modular system makes
our system reconfigurable to adapt to different picking scenarios. We designed,
manufactured, and tested a picking head with 2.5 DOF (2 independent mechanisms
and 1 dependent cutting system) capable of removing possible occlusions and
harvesting targeted strawberries without contacting fruit flesh to avoid damage
and bruising. In addition, we developed a novel perception system to localise
strawberries and detect their key points, picking points, and determine their
ripeness. For this purpose, we introduced two new datasets. Finally, we tested
the system in a commercial strawberry growing field and our research farm with
three different strawberry varieties. The results show the effectiveness and
reliability of the proposed system. The designed picking head was able to
remove occlusions and harvest strawberries effectively. The perception system
was able to detect and determine the ripeness of strawberries with 95%
accuracy. In total, the system was able to harvest 87% of all detected
strawberries with a success rate of 83% for all pluckable fruits. We also

contrast to the plain-text modeling as the focus of the PrLMs, dialogue texts
involve multiple speakers and reflect special characteristics such as topic
transitions and structure dependencies between distant utterances. However, the
related PrLM models commonly represent dialogues sequentially by processing the
pairwise dialogue history as a whole. Thus the hierarchical information on
either utterance interrelation or speaker roles coupled in such representations

holistic interaction across the utterances beyond the sequential
contextualization from PrLMs, in order to capture the utterance-aware and
speaker-aware representations entailed in a dialogue history. We decouple the
contextualized word representations by masking mechanisms in Transformer-based
PrLM, making each word only focus on the words in current utterance, other
utterances, and two speaker roles (i.e., utterances of sender and utterances of
the receiver), respectively. In addition, we employ domain-adaptive training
strategies to help the model adapt to the dialogue domains. Experimental
results show that our method substantially boosts the strong PrLM baselines in

WDs older than 2-3 Gyr, demonstrating that in low- and average-mass WDs, the
effects of magnetism become more common as they age, and the fields on average
become stronger. However, the available statistics of WDs older than about 5
Gyr do not clearly establish how fields evolve beyond this age. We are carrying
out a survey to clarify the occurrence of magnetism in DC-type WDs in order to
better understand this late evolution. We use broadband filter polarimetry,
arguably the most efficient way to detect magnetic fields in featureless WDs
via continuum circular polarization. Here we report the discovery of a magnetic
field in five DC WDs (of 23 observed), almost doubling the total sample of

between mobile phone-derived mobility metrics and COVID-19 cases and deaths in
more than 200 European subnational regions. We found that past knowledge of
mobility does not provide statistically significant information on COVID-19

geographic and demographic factors, such as users' coverage and commuting

that diversity is in fact a hidden dimension in the bias-variance decomposition

bias-variance-diversity decompositions, for both classification and regression
losses, e.g., squared, and cross-entropy. The framework provides a methodology
to automatically identify the combiner rule enabling such a decomposition,

just two design choices: the loss, and the combiner. For certain choices (e.g.,

predict the future environment and mount a response ahead of time. To this end,
cells need to encode the past signal into the output of the intracellular

costly while not all features of the past signal are equally informative on the
future input signal. Here, we show, for two classes of input signals, that
cellular networks can reach the fundamental bound on the predictive information
as set by the information extracted from the past signal: push-pull networks
can reach this information bound for Markovian signals, while networks that
take a temporal derivative can reach the bound for predicting the future
derivative of non-Markovian signals. However, the bits of past information that
are most informative about the future signal are also prohibitively costly. As
a result, the optimal system that maximizes the predictive information for a
given resource cost is, in general, not at the information bound. Applying our
theory to the chemotaxis network of Escherichia coli reveals that its adaptive
kernel is optimal for predicting future concentration changes over a broad
range of background concentrations, and that the system has been tailored to
predicting these changes in shallow gradients.

effect of two proximity-induced interactions: superconducting pairing and a
(spatially inhomogeneous) Zeeman exchange field. The coexistence of these
competing interactions generates a rich quantum phase diagram and a complex
subgap Andreev bound state (ABS) spectrum. By exploiting the symmetries of the

even and odd ABS with respect to the spatial inversion symmetry $x\to -x$. We
find the ABS spectrum of the device as a function of the different parameters

Zeeman exchange field $h_0$, and the induced superconducting coherence length
$\xi$. In particular we analyze the evolution of the subgap spectrum as a
function of the length $L$. Interestingly, we have found that depending on the
ratio $h_0/\Delta$, the emerging ABS can eventually cross below the Fermi
energy at certain critical values $L_c$, and induce spin-and fermion
parity-changing quantum phase transitions. We argue that this type of device
constitute a promising highly-tunable platform to engineer subgap ABS.

both a strong topological insulator phase as well as a crystalline topological
phase co-exist. The formation of a supercurrent through the Bi$_4$Te$_3$ layer
is explained by a two-step process. First, due to the close proximity of the
Al/Ti electrodes a superconducting gap is induced within the Bi$_4$Te$_3$ layer
right below the electrodes. The size of this gap is determined by analysing
multiple Andreev reflections (MARs) identified within the devices differential
resistance at low voltage biases. Second, based on the Andreev reflection and
reverse Andreev reflection processes a supercurrent establishes in the weak
link region in between these two proximity coupled regions. Analyses of the
temperature dependency of both the critical current as well as MARs indicate
mostly ballistic supercurrent contributions in between the proximitized
Bi$_4$Te$_3$ regions even though the material is characterized by a
semi-metallic bulk phase. The presence of these ballistic modes gives
indications on the topological nature of Bi$_4$Te$_3$.

with multiple submodels to learn from different perspectives. To avoid
transferring erroneous pseudo labels between these submodels, a high threshold
is usually used to filter out a large number of low-confidence predictions for
unlabeled data. However, such filtering can not fully exploit unlabeled data
with low prediction confidence. To overcome this problem, in this work, we
propose a mutual learning framework based on pseudo-negative labels. Negative
labels are those that a corresponding data item does not belong. In each
iteration, one submodel generates pseudo-negative labels for each data item,
and the other submodel learns from these labels. The role of the two submodels
exchanges after each iteration until convergence. By reducing the prediction
probability on pseudo-negative labels, the dual model can improve its
prediction ability. We also propose a mechanism to select a few pseudo-negative
labels to feed into submodels. In the experiments, our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on several main benchmarks. Specifically, with our
framework, the error rates of the 13-layer CNN model are 9.35% and 7.94% for

loss-gain system which introduces unavoidable noise and consequently, this
limits the coherent control of propagation dynamics. Here, we show that an
all-dielectric, non-dissipative photonic crystal (PC) could host, at least two
exceptional points in its eigenvalue spectrum. By introducing optimum
apodization in the PC architecture, namely 1D-APC, we show that such a
configuration supports a spectrum of exceptional points which distinctly
demarcates the PT-symmetric region from the region where PT -symmetry is broken
in the parameter space. The analytical framework allows us to estimate the

the excitation of topologically-protected optical Tamm-plasmon modes in

Natural Language processing (NLP) has been used extensively to process this

applications. A Language Model is a probability distribution over a word
sequence. Self-supervised Learning on a large corpus of data automatically
generates deep learning-based language models. BioBERT and Med-BERT are
language models pre-trained for the healthcare domain. Healthcare uses typical
NLP tasks such as question answering, information extraction, named entity
recognition, and search to simplify and improve processes. However, to ensure
robust application of the results, NLP practitioners need to normalize and
standardize them. One of the main ways of achieving normalization and
standardization is the use of Knowledge Graphs. A Knowledge Graph captures
concepts and their relationships for a specific domain, but their creation is
time-consuming and requires manual intervention from domain experts, which can
prove expensive. SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical
Terms), Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and Gene Ontology (GO) are
popular ontologies from the healthcare domain. SNOMED CT and UMLS capture
concepts such as disease, symptoms and diagnosis and GO is the world's largest
source of information on the functions of genes. Healthcare has been dealing
with an explosion in information about different types of drugs, diseases, and
procedures. This paper argues that using Knowledge Graphs is not the best
solution for solving problems in this domain. We present experiments using LLMs
for the healthcare domain to demonstrate that language models provide the same
functionality as knowledge graphs, thereby making knowledge graphs redundant.

bonded strongly with the benzene ring of PCP222 via Dewar interaction.
Subsequently, the calculation of the diffusion energy barrier revealed a
significantly high energy barrier of 5.97 eV preventing the Ti clustering over
PCP222 surface. On adsorption of hydrogen, the first H2 molecule was
chemisorbed over PCP222 with a binding energy of 1.79 eV with the Ti metals.
Further addition of H2 molecules, however, exhibited their physisorption over
PCP222-Ti through the Kubas type H2 interaction. The charge transfer mechanism
during the hydrogen adsorption was explored by the Hirshfeld charge analysis
and electrostatic potential map, and the PDOS, and Baders topological analysis
revealed the nature of the interaction between Ti and H2. The PCP222
functionalized with three Ti atoms showed a maximum hydrogen uptake capacity of
up to 7.37 wt%, which was fairly above the US-DOE criterion. The practical H2
storage estimation revealed that at ambient conditions, the gravimetric density
of up to 6.06 wt% H2 molecules could be usable, and up to 1.31 wt% of adsorbed
H2 molecules were retained with the host. The ADMP molecular dynamics
simulations assured the reversibility by desorption of adsorbed H2 and the
structural integrity of the host material at sufficiently above the desorption
temperature (300K and 500K). Therefore, the Ti-functionalized PCP222 can be

neural networks, they tend to produce overly confident uncertainty estimates
and can introduce bias when BNNs are applied to data. In this work, we
implement multiplicative normalizing flows (MNFs), a family of approximate
posteriors for the parameters of BNNs with the purpose of enhancing the
flexibility of the variational posterior distribution, to extract $\Omega_m$,
$h$, and $\sigma_8$ from the QUIJOTE simulations. We have compared this method
with respect to the standard BNNs, and the flipout estimator. We found that
MNFs combined with BNNs outperform the other models obtaining predictive
performance with almost one order of magnitude larger that standard BNNs,
$\sigma_8$ extracted with high accuracy ($r^2=0.99$), and precise uncertainty
estimates. The latter implies that MNFs provide more realistic predictive
distribution closer to the true posterior mitigating the bias introduced by the
variational approximation and allowing to work with well-calibrated networks.

Specifically, we showed that by properly tailoring the spatial distribution of
the linear state of polarization transverse to the direction of propagation,
the beam followed a curved trajectory in free space. Here we extend the model
to the partially coherent, polychromatic case by redefining the beam amplitude,
phase, and polarization angle as appropriate statistical quantities. In
particular, we propose an entirely new definition of linear polarization
gradient as an average over the third generalized Stokes parameter in the
spatial frequency domain. In the new model, the beam curvature matches that of
our previous work in the fully coherent case, but is predicted to gradually
vanish as the beam loses coherence and becomes depolarized. The model also
clearly predicts, however, that there does not exist a natural mechanism in
free space or due to atmospheric turbulence that will cause significant
depolarization. Simulated beam trajectories are shown for varying levels of
initial partial coherence and for different polarization profiles. A new class
of non-diffracting beams is also suggested by way of example. Lastly, as a
byproduct of the derivation we generalize a previously known result concerning
the free-space propagation of generalized Stokes parameters [13] by showing the
result also holds for propagation in inhomogeneous media.

Perhaps the greatest source of uncertainty is the electron density of the

rates. Here we present spatially-resolved, wide spectral-coverage Xshooter
observations of the nearby active galaxy IC 5063 (z=0.001131), which shows
clear signatures of outflows being driven by shocks induced by a radio jet
interacting with the ISM. For the first time, we use the higher
critical-density transauroral [SII] and [OII] lines to derive electron
densities in spatially-resolved observations of an active galaxy, and present
evidence that the lines are emitted in the same spatial regions as other key
diagnostic lines. In addition, we find that the post-shock gas is denser than
the pre-shock gas, possibly due to shock compression effects. We derive kinetic
powers for the warm ionised outflow phase and find them to be below those
required by galaxy evolution models; however, other studies of different gas
phases in IC 5063 allow us to place our results in a wider context in which the
cooler gas phases constitute most of the outflowing mass. We investigate the
dominant ionisation and excitation mechanisms and find that the warm ionised
outflow phase is dominated by AGN-photoionisation, while the warm molecular
phase has composite AGN-shock excitation. Overall, our results highlight the
importance of robust outflow diagnostics and reinforce the utility of the
transauroral lines for future studies of outflows in active galaxies.

Surface Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) offers a non-invasive solution
to restore the lost abilities. However, inducing desired movements using FES is
still an open engineering problem. This problem is accentuated by the
complexities of human arms' neuromechanics and the variations across
individuals. Reinforcement Learning (RL) emerges as a promising approach to
govern customised control rules for different subjects and settings. Yet, one
remaining challenge of using RL to control FES is unobservable muscle fatigue
that progressively changes as an unknown function of the stimulation, breaking
the Markovian assumption of RL. In this work, we present a method to address
the unobservable muscle fatigue issue, allowing our RL controller to achieve
higher control performances. Our method is based on a Gaussian State-Space
Model (GSSM) that utilizes recurrent neural networks to learn Markovian
state-spaces from partial observations. The GSSM is used as a filter that
converts the observations into the state-space representation for RL to
preserve the Markovian assumption. Here, we start with presenting the
modification of the original GSSM to address an overconfident issue. We then
present the interaction between RL and the modified GSSM, followed by the setup
for FES control learning. We test our RL-GSSM system on a planar reaching
setting in simulation using a detailed neuromechanical model and show that the
GSSM can help RL maintain its control performance against the fatigue.

ions/cm$^2$. Before and after irradiation the nanolayer surfaces were
investigated using the atomic force microscope. As the result, well pronounced
modifications of the nanolayer surfaces in the form of craters have been
observed. A systematic analysis of the crater sizes (diameter on the surface

the neutralization energy on the size of the obtained nanostructures. The

the quantum two-state vector model of the ionic Rydberg states population. The
charge dependent ion-atom interaction potential inside the solid is used for
the calculation of the nuclear stopping power. According to the model the

to examine whether exposure to inquiry-based science content courses that
actively involve students in the collaborative process of learning and
discovery can promote a positive change in attitudes toward science across
several different dimensions. To examine this issue, surveys and administrative
data were collected from over 200 students enrolled in the Hands-on-Science

well as more than 200 students in a comparison group enrolled in traditional

scales measuring confidence, enjoyment, anxiety, and perceptions of relevance,
while those in the comparison group experienced a decline in favorable
attitudes to science. These patterns offer empirical support for the
attitudinal benefits of inquiry-based instruction and have implications for the

learning model. FL is promoted as a privacy-enhancing technology (PET) that
provides data minimization: data never ""leaves"" personal devices and users
share only model updates with a server (e.g., a company) coordinating the
distributed training. While prior work showed that in vanilla FL a malicious
server can extract users' private data from the model updates, in this work we
take it further and demonstrate that a malicious server can reconstruct user
data even in hardened versions of the protocol. More precisely, we propose an
attack against FL protected with distributed differential privacy (DDP) and
secure aggregation (SA). Our attack method is based on the introduction of
sybil devices that deviate from the protocol to expose individual users' data
for reconstruction by the server. The underlying root cause for the
vulnerability to our attack is a power imbalance: the server orchestrates the
whole protocol and users are given little guarantees about the selection of
other users participating in the protocol. Moving forward, we discuss
requirements for privacy guarantees in FL. We conclude that users should only
participate in the protocol when they trust the server or they apply local
primitives such as local DP, shifting power away from the server. Yet, the
latter approaches come at significant overhead in terms of performance
degradation of the trained model, making them less likely to be deployed in
practice.

of the lithium are not stripped reversibly and remain isolated from the current
collector. This isolated lithium is trapped in the insulating remaining
solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) shell and contributes to the capacity loss.
However, a fundamental understanding of why isolated lithium forms and how it
can be mitigated is lacking. In this article, we perform a combined theoretical
and experimental study to understand isolated lithium formation during
stripping. We derive a thermodynamic consistent model of lithium dissolution
and find that the interaction between lithium and SEI leads to locally
preferred stripping and isolated lithium formation. Based on a cryogenic
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) setup, we reveal that these local
effects are particularly pronounced at kinks of lithium whiskers. We find that
lithium stripping can be heterogeneous both on a nanoscale and on a larger
scale. Cryo TEM observations confirm our theoretical prediction that isolated
lithium occurs less at higher stripping current densities. The origin of
isolated lithium lies in local effects, such as heterogeneous SEI, stress
fields, or the geometric shape of the deposits. We conclude that in order to
mitigate isolated lithium, a uniform lithium morphology during plating and a
homogeneous SEI is indispensable.

contained in a given spatial region is still unresolved, except for particular
cases of localized objects where the asymptotic flatness holds for a given

whole energy content is not uniquely defined in a specific volume. Here we
generalize the Einstein gravitational energy-momentum pseudotensor to non-local
theories of gravity where analytic functions of the non-local integral operator
$\Box^{-1}$ are taken into account. We apply the Noether theorem to a
gravitational Lagrangian, supposed invariant under the one-parameter group of
diffeomorphisms, that is, the infinitesimal rigid translations. The invariance
of non-local gravitational action under global translations leads to a locally
conserved Noether current, and thus, to the definition of a gravitational
energy-momentum pseudotensor, which is an affine object transforming like a
tensor under affine transformations. Furthermore, the energy-momentum complex
remains locally conserved, thanks to the non-local contracted Bianchi
identities. The continuity equations for the gravitational pseudotensor and the
energy-momentum complex, taking into account both gravitational and matter
components, can be derived. Finally, the weak field limit of pseudotensor is
performed to lowest order in metric perturbation in view of astrophysical
applications.

because the plasma oscillation period directly depend not only on the final
number density of created particles, but also on the external electric field
parameters. Moreover, it is found that the momentum spectrum presents complex
interferences after considering the backreaction. These results give us the

the optimal image resolution is critical to achieving superior performance.

slip-related geohazards such as rock avalanches, landslides, and earthquakes.
However, descriptions of the progressive damage on the shear surface are still
incomplete or ambiguous. In this study, we use the hybrid finite-discrete
element method (FDEM) to simulate a shear experiment and obtain a detailed
comprehension of shear induced progressive damage and the associated seismic
activity. We built a laboratory fault model from high resolution surface scans
and micro-CT imaging. Our results show that under quasi-static shear loading,
the fault surface experiences local dynamic seismic activities. We found that
the seismic activity is related to the stress concentration on interlocking
asperities. This interlocking behavior (i) causes stress concentration at the
region of contact that could reach the compressive strength, and (ii) produces
tensile stress up to the tensile strength in the region adjacent to the contact
area. Thus, different failure mechanisms and damage patterns including crushing
and sub-vertical fracturing are observed on the rough surface. Asperity failure
creates rapid local slips resulting in significant stress perturbations that
alter the overall stress condition and may trigger the slip of adjacent
critically stressed asperities. We found that the spatial distribution of the
damaged asperities and the seismic activity is highly heterogeneous; regions
with intense asperity interactions formed gouge material, while others exhibit
minimal to no damage. These results emphasize the important role of surface
roughness in controlling the overall shear behavior and the local dynamic
seismic activities on faults.

developed method allows us to simultaneously identify significant details of
the Galactic warping and estimate the offset $z_\odot$ of the Sun relative to

is applied to data on classical Cepheids. Significant local extremes of the
average disk surface model were found: the minimum in the first Galactic

has been confirmed. The optimal order of the model was found to be
$n_\text{o}=4$. The local (near the Sun, $n_\text{o}=0$) estimate of $z_\odot =

However, deploying AVs to real-world systems is challenging due to safety and

$\textit{human-compatible control}$, where human drivers are guided by
real-time instructions to stabilize the traffic. To respect drivers' cognitive
load, a class of $\textit{piecewise-constant policies}$ is considered, where
periodic instructions are given every $\Delta$ seconds to human drivers, who
hold the instructed action constant until the next instruction. While previous
works separately consider stability analysis for continuous AV control or the
extent to which human drivers can follow guidance, this article is the first to
consider an integrated theoretical analysis, directly relating the guidance
provided to the human drivers to the traffic flow stability outcome. Casting
the problem into the Lyapunov stability framework, sufficient conditions are
derived for piecewise-constant controls with hold length $\Delta$ to stabilize
the system. Numerical simulations reveal that the theoretical analysis closely
matches simulated results, and, importantly, classical stability concepts are
insufficient for explaining hold lengths. Additionally, the theoretical and
empirical analyses can be leveraged to derive improved controllers with greater

under the influence of electromagnetic field in $f(G,T)$ theory, where $G$ and
$T$ indicate the Gauss-Bonnet term and trace of the stress-energy tensor,
respectively. For this purpose, we calculate the modified field equations,
non-conservation equation and mass distributions that assist in comprehending
the structure of astrophysical objects. The Riemann tensor is divided into
different structure scalars, among which one is called the complexity factor.
This factor is used to measure complexity of the system due to the involvement
of inhomogeneous energy density, anisotropic pressure and charge. The vanishing
of the complexity factor is employed as a constraint to formulate charged
static solutions for the Gokhroo-Mehra model and polytropic equation of state.
We conclude that the presence of charge reduces the complexity of the
anisotropic system.

geometric and semantic information is of foremost importance for the
large-scale deployment of autonomous driving. To automatically generate such
type of map from a set of images captured by a vehicle, most works formulate
this mapping as a segmentation problem, which implies heavy post-processing to
obtain the final vectorized representation. Alternative techniques have the
ability to generate an HD map in an end-to-end manner but rely on
computationally expensive auto-regressive models. To bring camera-based to an
applicable level, we propose InstaGraM, a fast end-to-end network generating a
vectorized HD map via instance-level graph modeling of the map elements. Our
strategy consists of three main stages: top-view feature extraction, road
elements' vertices and edges detection, and conversion to a semantic vector
representation. After top-down feature extraction, an encoder-decoder
architecture is utilized to predict a set of vertices and edge maps of the road
elements. Finally, these vertices along with edge maps are associated through
an attentional graph neural network generating a semantic vectorized map.
Instead of relying on a common segmentation approach, we propose to regress
distance transform maps as they provide strong spatial relations and
directional information between vertices. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes
dataset show that our proposed network outperforms HDMapNet by 13.7 mAP and
achieves comparable accuracy with VectorMapNet 5x faster inference speed.

reduction in program size and/or improvement in program efficiency. Prior works
on compilation pass ordering have two major drawbacks. They either require an
excessive budget (in terms of compilation steps) at compile time or fail to
generalize to unseen programs. In this paper, for code-size reduction tasks, we
propose a novel pipeline to find program-dependent pass sequences within 45
compilation calls. It first identifies a coreset of 50 pass sequences via
greedy optimization of a submodular function, and then learns a policy with
Graph Neural Network (GNN) to pick the optimal sequence by predicting the
normalized values of the pass sequences in the coreset. Despite its simplicity,
our pipeline outperforms the default -Oz flag by an average of 4.7% over a
large collection (4683) of unseen code repositories from diverse domains across
14 datasets. In comparison, previous approaches like reinforcement learning on
the raw pass sequence space may take days to train due to sparse reward, and
may not generalize well in held-out ones from different domains. Our results
demonstrate that existing human-designed compiler flags can be improved with a
simple yet effective technique that transforms the raw action space into a

domains in terms of generation quality and downstream task performance. In the
continuous domain, a key factor behind this success is the usage of quantized
latent spaces (e.g., obtained via VQ-VAE autoencoders), which allow for
dimensionality reduction and faster inference times. However, using existing
pre-trained models to perform new non-trivial tasks is difficult since it
requires additional fine-tuning or extensive training to elicit prompting. This
paper introduces LASS as a way to perform vector-quantized Latent
Autoregressive Source Separation (i.e., de-mixing an input signal into its
constituent sources) without requiring additional gradient-based optimization
or modifications of existing models. Our separation method relies on the
Bayesian formulation in which the autoregressive models are the priors, and a
discrete (non-parametric) likelihood function is constructed by performing
frequency counts over latent sums of addend tokens. We test our method on
images and audio with several sampling strategies (e.g., ancestral, beam
search) showing competitive results with existing approaches in terms of
separation quality while offering at the same time significant speedups in
terms of inference time and scalability to higher dimensional data.

paper, we proposed a novel deep learning model named Spectral Cross-domain
neural network (SCDNN) with a new block called Soft-adaptive threshold spectral
enhancement (SATSE), to simultaneously reveal the key information embedded in
spectral and time domains inside the neural network. More precisely, the
domain-cross information is captured by a general Convolutional neural network
(CNN) backbone, and different information sources are merged by a self-adaptive
mechanism to mine the connection between time and spectral domains. In SATSE,
the knowledge from time and spectral domains is extracted via the Fast Fourier
Transformation (FFT) with soft trainable thresholds in modified Sigmoid
functions. The proposed SCDNN is tested with several classification tasks
implemented on the public ECG databases \textit{PTB-XL} and \textit{MIT-BIH}.
SCDNN outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with a low computational cost
regarding a variety of metrics in all classification tasks on both databases,
by finding appropriate domains from the infinite spectral mapping. The
convergence of the trainable thresholds in the spectral domain is also
numerically investigated in this paper. The robust performance of SCDNN
provides a new perspective to exploit knowledge across deep learning models

The work zone signs are placed according to the location of the end-of-queue of
vehicles which usually changes rapidly. The detection of moving objects in
video captured by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) has been extensively
researched so far, and is used in a wide array of applications including
traffic monitoring. Unlike the fixed traffic cameras, UAVs can be used to
monitor the traffic at work zones in real-time and also in a more
cost-effective way. This study presents a method as a proof of concept for
detecting End-of-Queue (EOQ) of traffic by processing the real-time video
footage of a highway work zone captured by UAV. EOQ is detected in the video by
image processing which includes background subtraction and blob detection
methods. This dynamic localization of EOQ of vehicles will enable faster and
more accurate relocation of work zone warning signs for drivers and thus will
reduce work zone fatalities. The method can be applied to detect EOQ of
vehicles and notify drivers in any other roads or intersections too where
vehicles are rapidly accumulating due to special events, traffic jams,
construction, or accidents.

  Hyperspectral Image Classification",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning methods have been successfully applied to hyperspectral image
(HSI) classification with remarkable performance. Because of limited labelled
HSI data, earlier studies primarily adopted a patch-based classification
framework, which divides images into overlapping patches for training and
testing. However, this approach results in redundant computations and possible
information leakage. In this study, we propose an objective evaluation-based
high-efficiency learning framework for tiny HSI classification. This framework
comprises two main parts: (i) a leakage-free balanced sampling strategy, and
(ii) a modified end-to-end fully convolutional network (FCN) architecture that
optimizes the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The leakage-free
balanced sampling strategy generates balanced and non-overlapping training and
testing data by partitioning an HSI and the ground truth image into small
windows, each of which corresponds to one training or testing sample. The
proposed high-efficiency FCN exhibits a pixel-to-pixel architecture with
modifications aimed at faster inference speed and improved parameter
efficiency. Experiments conducted on four representative datasets demonstrated
that the proposed sampling strategy can provide objective performance
evaluation and that the proposed network outperformed many state-of-the-art
approaches with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. Our source code is

calving signs from video. Calving sign detection from a camera, which is a
non-contact sensor, is expected to enable more efficient livestock management.
As large-scale, well-developed data cannot generally be assumed when
establishing calving detection systems, the basis for making the prediction
needs to be presented to farmers during operation, so black-box modeling (also
known as end-to-end modeling) is not appropriate. For practical operation of
calving detection systems, the present study aims to incorporate expert
knowledge into a deep neural network. To this end, we propose a multi-stream
calving sign detection network in which multiple calving-related features are
extracted from the corresponding feature extraction networks designed for each
attribute with different characteristics, such as a cow's posture, rotation,
and movement, known as calving signs, and are then integrated appropriately
depending on the cow's situation. Experimental comparisons conducted using
videos of 15 cows demonstrated that our multi-stream system yielded a
significant improvement over the end-to-end system, and the multi-stream
architecture significantly contributed to a reduction in detection errors. In
addition, the distinctive mixture weights we observed helped provide
interpretability of the system's behavior.

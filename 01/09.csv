exterior to the one of the primary perturber. Starting with a multipole
expansion of the barycentric (Jacobi-reduced) Hamiltonian, we carry out a
sequence of normalizations in Delaunay variables by Lie series, leading to a
secular Hamiltonian model without use of relegation. To this end, we introduce
a book-keeping analogous to the one proposed in Cavallari and Efthymiopoulos
(2022) for test particle orbits interior to the one of the primary perturber,
but here adapted, instead, to the case of exterior orbits. We give numerical
examples of the performance of the method in both the planar circular and the
spatial elliptic restricted three-body problem, for parameters pertinent to the
Sun-Jupiter system. In particular, we demonstrate the method's accuracy in
terms of reproducibility of the orbital elements' variations far from
mean-motion resonances. As a basic outcome of the method, we show how, using as
criterion the size of the series' remainder, we reach to obtain an accurate
semi-analytical estimate of the boundary (in the space of orbital elements)

fast degree of freedom provides a valid approximation of the true dynamics.

-3.5<logU<-2.0. Blue Bump (BB), the characteristic feature of the WR stars,
however, is not detected in any of the spectra. We demonstrate that this
non-detection is due to the relatively low equivalent width (EW) of the BB in
metal-poor SSPs, in spite of containing sufficient number of WR stars to
reproduce the observed I(HeII4686)/I(Hbeta) ratio of 1.5% at the Cartwheel
metallicity of Z=0.004. The HII regions in the WR phase that are coincident
with a ULX source do not show line ratios characteristic of ionization by X-ray

He+ in two (#99, 144) of the five regions that are not in the WR phase.
Ionization by radiative shocks along with the presence of channels for the
selective leakage of ionizing photons are the likely scenarios in #17 and #148,

paper, we use the Perron-Frobenius operator in stochastic process to develop a

filtering and works for non-Gaussian distributions for nonlinear stochastic
dynamical systems. The recursion of the filtering can be characterized by the
composition of Perron-Frobenius operator and likelihood operator. This gives a
significant connection between the Perron-Frobenius operator and Bayesian
filtering. We numerically fulfil the recursion through approximating the
Perron-Frobenius operator by Ulam's method. In this way, the posterior measure
is represented by a convex combination of the indicator functions in Ulam's
method. To get a low rank approximation for the Perron-Frobenius operator
filter, we take a spectral decomposition for the posterior measure by using the
eigenfunctions of the discretized Perron-Frobenius operator. A convergence
analysis is carried out and shows that the Perron-Frobenius operator filter
achieves a higher convergence rate than the particle filter, which uses Dirac
measures for the posterior. The proposed method is explored for the data

artery datasets were acquired using a portable 3D US imaging system. A U-Net
segmentation network was firstly applied to extract the carotid artery on 2D
transverse frame, then a novel 3D reconstruction algorithm using fast dot
projection (FDP) method with position regularization was proposed to
reconstruct the carotid artery volume. Furthermore, a convolutional neural
network was used to classify the healthy case and diseased case qualitatively.
3D volume analysis including longitudinal reprojection algorithm and stenosis
grade measurement algorithm was developed to obtain the clinical metrics
quantitatively. Results: The proposed system achieved sensitivity of 0.714,
specificity of 0.851 and accuracy of 0.803 respectively in diagnosis of carotid
atherosclerosis. The automatically measured stenosis grade illustrated good
correlation (r=0.762) with the experienced expert measurement. Conclusion: the
developed technique based on 3D US imaging can be applied to the automatic
diagnosis of carotid atherosclerosis. Significance: The proposed deep-learning
based technique was specially designed for a portable 3D freehand US system,
which can provide carotid atherosclerosis examination more conveniently and
decrease the dependence on clinician's experience.

candidate algorithms whose serving cost is suspected to be optimal up-to a

with some important issues in composability verification and a verification
process is suggested to verify composability of different kinds of systems
models, such as reactive, real-time and probabilistic systems. With an
assumption that all these systems are concurrent in nature in which different
composed components interact with each other simultaneously, the requirements
for the extensive techniques for the structural and behavioral analysis becomes
increasingly challenging. The proposed verification framework provides methods,
techniques and tool support for verifying composability at its different
levels. These levels are defined as foundations of consistent model
composability. Each level is discussed in detail and an approach is presented
to verify composability at that level. In particular we focus on the
Dynamic-Semantic Composability level due to its significance in the overall
composability correctness and also due to the level of difficulty it poses in
the process. In order to verify composability at this level we investigate the
application of three different approaches namely (i) Petri Nets based Algebraic
Analysis (ii) Colored Petri Nets (CPN) based State-space Analysis and (iii)
Communicating Sequential Processes based Model Checking. All three approaches
attack the problem of verifying dynamic-semantic composability in different
ways however they all share the same aim i.e., to confirm the correctness of a

undisturbed. We model the distribution and kinematics of the stars and the
molecular gas in four late-type cluster galaxies (JO201, JO204, JO206, and

pressure stripping. We analyze MUSE@VLT data and CO data from ALMA searching
for signatures of radial gas flows, ram pressure stripping, and other
perturbations. We find that all galaxies, with the possible exception of JW100,
host stellar bars. Signatures of ram pressure are found in JO201 and JO206,
which also shows clear indications of ongoing stripping in the molecular disk
outskirts. The stripping affects the whole molecular gas disk of JW100. The
molecular gas kinematics in JO204 is instead dominated by rotation rather than
ram pressure. We also find indications of enhanced turbulence of the molecular
gas compared to field galaxies. Large-scale radial flows of molecular gas are
present in JO204 and JW100, but more uncertain in JO201 and JO206. We show that
our sample follows the molecular gas mass-size relation, confirming that it is
essentially independent of environment even for the most extreme cases of
stripping. Our findings are consistent with the molecular gas being affected by
the ram pressure on different timescales and less severely than the atomic and
ionized gas phases, likely because the molecular gas is denser and more

distances on the sky is due to either the presence of multiple, in-spiraling
SMBHs, or to gravitational lensing of a single AGN. Both phenomena allow us to
address important astrophysical and cosmological questions. However, few
kpc-separation multiple AGN are currently known. Recently, the newly-developed
Gaia Multi peak (GMP) method provided numerous new candidate members of these
populations. We present spatially resolved, integral-field spectroscopy of a
sample of four GMP-selected multiple AGNs candidates. In all of these systems,
we detect two or more components with sub-arcsec separations. We find that two
of the systems are dual AGNs, one is either an intrinsic triple or a lensed
dual AGN, while the last system is a chance AGN/star alignment. Our
observations double the number of confirmed multiple AGNs at projected
separations below 7 kpc at z > 0.5, present the first detection of a possible
triple AGN in a single galaxy at z > 0.5, and successfully test the GMP method
as a novel technique to discover previously unknown multiple AGNs.

permittivity from scattered waves. Deep learning is a promising alternative to
traditional iterative solvers, but it has been used mostly in a supervised
framework to regress the permittivity patterns from scattered fields or
back-projections. While such methods are fast at test-time and achieve good
results for specific data distributions, they are sensitive to the distribution
drift of the scattered fields, common in practice. If the distribution of the
scattered fields changes due to changes in frequency, the number of
transmitters and receivers, or any other real-world factor, an end-to-end
neural network must be re-trained or fine-tuned on a new dataset. In this
paper, we propose a new data-driven framework for inverse scattering based on
deep generative models. We model the target permittivities by a low-dimensional
manifold which acts as a regularizer and learned from data. Unlike supervised
methods which require both scattered fields and target signals, we only need
the target permittivities for training; it can then be used with any
experimental setup. We show that the proposed framework significantly
outperforms the traditional iterative methods especially for strong scatterers
while having comparable reconstruction quality to state-of-the-art deep

growing search space which makes learning large programs intractable. Humans
mitigate this problem by leveraging the compositional nature of the real world:
In structured domains, a logical specification can often be decomposed into
smaller, complementary solution programs. We show that compositional
segmentation can be applied in the programming by examples setting to divide
the search for large programs across multiple smaller program synthesis
problems. For each example, we search for a decomposition into smaller units
which maximizes the reconstruction accuracy in the output under a latent task
program. A structural alignment of the constituent parts in the input and
output leads to pairwise correspondences used to guide the program synthesis
search. In order to align the input/output structures, we make use of the
Structure-Mapping Theory (SMT), a formal model of human analogical reasoning
which originated in the cognitive sciences. We show that decomposition-driven
program synthesis with structural alignment outperforms Inductive Logic
Programming (ILP) baselines on string transformation tasks even with minimal
knowledge priors. Unlike existing methods, the predictive accuracy of our agent
monotonically increases for additional examples and achieves an average time
complexity of $\mathcal{O}(m)$ in the number $m$ of partial programs for highly

extends the classical linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model from legged
locomotion on a static surface to DRS locomotion, by relaxing the LIP's
underlying assumption that the surface is static. The resulting model, which we
call ""DRS-LIP"", is explicitly time-varying. After converting the DRS-LIP into
Mathieu's equation, an approximate analytical solution of the DRS-LIP is
obtained, which is reasonably accurate with a low computational cost.
Furthermore, to illustrate the practical uses of the analytical results, they
are exploited to develop a hierarchical motion planner that efficiently
generates physically feasible trajectories for DRS locomotion. Finally, the
effectiveness of the proposed theoretical results and motion planner is
demonstrated both through PyBullet simulations and experimentally on a Laikago

Transverse oscillations are ubiquitously observed in the solar
corona, both in coronal loops and open magnetic flux tubes. Numerical
simulations suggest that their dissipation could heat coronal loops,
counterbalancing radiative losses. These models rely on a continuous driver at
the footpoint of the loops. However, analytical works predict that transverse
waves are subject to a cut-off in the transition region. It is thus unclear
whether they can reach the corona, and indeed heat coronal loops. Aims. Our
aims are to determine how the cut-off of kink waves affects their propagation
into the corona, and to characterize the variation of the cut-off frequency
with altitude. Methods. Using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we modelled
the propagation of kink waves in a magnetic flux tube, embedded in a realistic
atmosphere with thermal conduction, that starts in the chromosphere and extends
into the corona. We drove kink waves at four different frequencies, and
determined whether they experienced a cut-off. We then calculated the altitude
at which the waves were cut-off, and compared it to the prediction of several
analytical models. Results. We show that kink waves indeed experience a cut-off
in the transition region, and we identified the analytical model that gives the
best predictions. In addition, we show that waves with periods shorter than
approximately 500 s can still reach the corona by tunnelling through the
transition region, with little to no attenuation of their amplitude. This means
that such waves can still propagate from the footpoints of loop, and result in
heating in the corona.

Lipschitz continuous and the equation $Gx = 0$ admits a weak Minty solution,
where $\mathbb{E}[\cdot]$ is the expectation and $k$ is the iteration counter.
Our second method is a new accelerated randomized block-coordinate optimistic

a galaxy that intercepts and strongly lenses the radio blazar PKS 1830-211

and the first clearly associated with hydrogen. We detect effective
H144$\alpha$ (and H163$\alpha$) transitions at observed frequencies of 1156
(798) MHz by stacking 17 (27) RRLs with 21$\sigma$ (14$\sigma$) significance.
The RRL emission contains two main velocity components and is coincident in
velocity with HI 21 cm and OH 18 cm absorption. We use the RRL spectral line
energy distribution and a Bayesian analysis to constrain the density ($n_e$)
and the volume-averaged pathlength ($\ell$) of the ionized gas. We determine
$\log( n_e ) = 2.0_{-0.7}^{+1.0}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $\log( \ell ) =
-0.7_{-1.1}^{+1.1}$ pc towards the north east (NE) lensed image, likely tracing

recognition model based on the popular architecture of deep Siamese neural
networks, by mathematically changing a small fraction of its weights (i.e.,
without using any additional training or optimization). These backdoors force
the system to err only on specific persons which are preselected by the
attacker. For example, we show how such a backdoored system can take any two
images of a particular person and decide that they represent different persons
(an anonymity attack), or take any two images of a particular pair of persons
and decide that they represent the same person (a confusion attack), with
almost no effect on the correctness of its decisions for other persons.
Uniquely, we show that multiple backdoors can be independently installed by
multiple attackers who may not be aware of each other's existence with almost
no interference.
  We have experimentally verified the attacks on a FaceNet-based facial
recognition system, which achieves SOTA accuracy on the standard LFW dataset of
$99.35\%$. When we tried to individually anonymize ten celebrities, the network
failed to recognize two of their images as being the same person in $96.97\%$

different looking Morgan Freeman and Scarlett Johansson, for example, their
images were declared to be the same person in $91.51 \%$ of the time. For each
type of backdoor, we sequentially installed multiple backdoors with minimal
effect on the performance of each one (for example, anonymizing all ten
celebrities on the same model reduced the success rate for each celebrity by no
more than $0.91\%$). In all of our experiments, the benign accuracy of the

result, the radius $\rho/B$ indicates a localized condensate, as we increase

such condensate shows quantum Hall-type behavior. This radius is also inversely

increasing the Horndeski parameter decreases the critical temperature of the

$Pr = 1$, with both no-slip and free-slip boundary conditions. We obtain 2D and
3D solutions and determine the relation between the Rayleigh number $Ra$ and
the Nusselt number $Nu$. In 2D we vary $Ra$ between $0$ and $10^{14}$. In the
range $10^6 \le Ra \le 10^{10}$ the $Nu$-$Ra$ relation is $Nu \sim Ra^{1/5}$.
With $Ra$ greater than about $10^{11}$ we find a 2D regime with $Nu \sim
Ra^{1/4}$ over three decades, up to the highest 2D $Ra$. In 3D, with maximum
$Ra = 10^{11.5}$, we find only $Nu \sim Ra^{1/5}$. These results apply to both
free slip and no slip boundary conditions. The $Nu \sim Ra^{1/4}$ regime has a
double boundary layer (BL): there is a thin BL with thickness $\sim Ra^{-1/4}$
nested inside a thicker BL with thickness $\sim Ra^{-1/5}$. The $Ra^{-1/4}$ BL
thickness, which determines $Nu$, coincides with the Kolmogorov and Batchelor
scales of HC.
  Numerical and theoretical results indicate that 3D HC is qualitatively and
quantitatively similar to 2D HC. At the same $Ra$, the 3D $Nu$ exceeds the 2D
$Nu$ by less than $20$%, i.e., there is very little 3D enhancement of heat
transport. Boundary conditions are more important than dimensionality: the 2D
free-slip solutions have larger $Nu$ than 3D no-slip solutions. Using the
mechanical energy power integral of HC we show that the mean square vorticity
of 3D HC is nearly equal to that of 2D HC at the same $Ra$. Thus vorticity
amplification by strain-mediated vortex stretching does not operate in 3D HC.

a minibatch variant of SPP, namely M-SPP, for solving convex composite risk
minimization problems. The core contribution is a set of novel excess risk
bounds of M-SPP derived through the lens of algorithmic stability theory.
Particularly under smoothness and quadratic growth conditions, we show that
M-SPP with minibatch-size $n$ and iteration count $T$ enjoys an in-expectation
fast rate of convergence consisting of an
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T^2}\right)$ bias decaying term and an

results of SPP-type approaches by revealing the impact of noise level of model
on convergence rate. In the complementary small-$T$-large-$n$ regime, we
provide a two-phase extension of M-SPP to achieve comparable convergence rates.
Moreover, we derive a near-tight high probability (over the randomness of data)

extensively studied in the past fifteen years. Our main goal is to introduce
four new families of homogeneous free divisors and investigate central aspects
of the blowup algebras of their Jacobian ideals. For instance, for all families
the Rees algebra and its special fiber are shown to be Cohen-Macaulay -- a
desirable feature in blowup algebra theory. Moreover, we raise the problem of
when the analytic spread of the Jacobian ideal of a (not necessarily free)
polynomial is maximal, and we characterize this property with tools ranging
from cohomology to asymptotic depth. In addition, as an application, we give an
ideal-theoretic homological criterion for homaloidal divisors, i.e.,
hypersurfaces whose polar maps are birational.

  Mismatched Background Knowledge Bases",,,,,"cs.NI cs.AI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semantic communications learned on background knowledge bases (KBs) have been
identified as a promising technology for communications between intelligent
agents. Existing works assume that transceivers of semantic communications
share the same KB. However, intelligent transceivers may suffer from the
communication burden or worry about privacy leakage to exchange data in KBs.
Besides, the transceivers may independently learn from the environment and
dynamically update their KBs, leading to timely sharing of the KBs infeasible.
All these cause the mismatch between the KBs, which may result in a
semantic-level misunderstanding on the receiver side. To address this issue, we
propose a transceiver cooperative learning-assisted semantic communication
(TCL-SC) scheme against mismatched KBs. In TCL-SC, the transceivers
cooperatively train semantic encoder and decoder neuron networks (NNs) of the
same structure based on their own KBs. They periodically share the parameters
of NNs. To reduce the communication overhead of parameter sharing, parameter
quantization is adopted. Moreover, we discuss the impacts of the number of
communication rounds on the performance of semantic communication systems.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our proposed TCL-SC can reduce
the semantic-level misunderstanding on the receiver side caused by the mismatch
between the KBs, especially at the low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio regime.

collect large volume of trajectory data in diverse application domains. Machine
learning allows to study the activities or behaviours of moving objects (e.g.,

In this study, we consider the task of classifying the activities of moving

companies to develop appropriate management policies, and optimise safety,
productivity, and efficiency. We present a semi-supervised machine learning
approach that first applies an information theoretic criterion to partition a
long trajectory into a set of segments such that the object exhibits
homogeneous behaviour within each segment. The segments are then labelled
automatically based on a constrained hierarchical clustering method. Finally, a
deep learning classification model based on convolutional neural networks is
trained on trajectory segments and the generated pseudo labels. The proposed
approach has been evaluated on a dataset containing indoor trajectories of
multiple workers collected from a tricycle assembly workshop. The proposed
approach is shown to achieve high classification accuracy (F-score varies
between 0.81 to 0.95 for different trajectories) using only a small proportion

attempt to better capture sentiment from sentences with complex syntactic
structures by introducing aspect-level sentiment classification (ASC). Despite
the growing interest, however, fine-grained sentiment analysis has not been
fully explored in non-English literature due to the shortage of annotated
finance-specific data. Accordingly, it is necessary for non-English languages
to leverage datasets and pre-trained language models (PLM) of different

finance-specific ASC research in the Korean language, we build KorFinASC, a
Korean aspect-level sentiment classification dataset for finance consisting of
12,613 human-annotated samples, and explore methods of intermediate transfer

the potentially wrong knowledge of financial entities encoded during the

sample efficiency. However, existing worst-case regret analysis typically
requires optimistic planning, which is not realistic in general. In contrast,
motivated by the theory, empirical study utilizes ensemble of models, which
achieve state-of-the-art performance on various testing environments. Such
deviation between theory and empirical study leads us to question whether
randomized model ensemble guarantee optimism, and hence the optimal worst-case
regret? This paper partially answers such question from the perspective of
reward randomization, a scarcely explored direction of exploration with MBRL.
We show that under the kernelized linear regulator (KNR) model, reward
randomization guarantees a partial optimism, which further yields a
near-optimal worst-case regret in terms of the number of interactions. We
further extend our theory to generalized function approximation and identified
conditions for reward randomization to attain provably efficient exploration.
Correspondingly, we propose concrete examples of efficient reward
randomization. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis establishes the first
worst-case regret analysis on randomized MBRL with function approximation.

(IR)-dark and 9 IR-bright types, which correspond to an evolutionary sequence
from the IR-dark to IR-bright stage. The central massive clumps and their
associated most massive cores are observed to follow a trend of increasing mass
($M$) and mass surface density ($\Sigma$) with evolution from IR-dark to

objects (YSOs) are revealed in both IR-dark and IR-bright HFSs with massive
YSOs located in the hub and the population of low-mass YSOs distributed over
larger areas. Moreover, outflow feedback in all HFSs are found to escape
preferentially through the inter-filamentary diffuse cavities, suggesting that
outflows would render a limited effect on the disruption of the HFSs and
ongoing high-mass star formation therein. From the above observations, we

without damaging grid performance is difficult.
  We study power adaptation algorithms that use grid metrics and seek to reduce
datacenter (DC) operational carbon emissions. First, we consider local, online
adaptation. Second, to reduce grid disruption that can arise from adaptation,
we consider using an external coordinator that limits aggregate impact.
Finally, we study a novel cooperative scheme, where datacenters first create a
full-day adapted power plan, based on day-ahead information, and then share it
with the power grid. This novel approach is a partnership that reflects the
shared responsibility between datacenter and the grid for carbon minimization.
For each, we report DC carbon emissions reduction and grid impacts.
  Results show that PlanShare, the novel cooperative scheme is superior to all
online approaches considered, achieving a net benefit of 12.6% reduction in
datacenter operational carbon emissions. PlanShare achieves 26%--132% better
performance than the best online approach, and far larger for many. This
benefit arises from allowing the grid optimization with full future DC load
information. Further it enables efficient DC resource management with a 24-hour
capacity schedule. It also decreases power cost for the entire grid

a linearized discrete isometry constraint and controls deformation gradients at
barycenters of elements. We prove $\Gamma$-convergence of LDG, design a fully
practical gradient flow, which gives rise to a linear scheme at every step, and
show energy stability and control of the isometry defect. We extend the
$\Gamma$-convergence analysis to piecewise quadratic creases. We also
illustrate the performance of the LDG method with several insightful

  submitted to Magnetic Resonance in Medicine",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: To develop an efficient simultaneous multi-slab imaging method with
blipped-controlled aliasing in parallel imaging (blipped-SMSlab) in a 4D
k-space framework, and demonstrate its efficacy in high-resolution diffusion
MRI (dMRI).
  Theory and Methods: First, the SMSlab 4D k-space signal expression is
formulated, and the phase interferences from intra-slab and inter-slab
encodings on the same physical z axis are analyzed. Then, the blipped-SMSlab
dMRI sequence is designed, with blipped-CAIPI gradients for inter-slab
encoding, and a 2D multi-band accelerated navigator for inter-kz-shot phase
correction. Third, strategies are developed to remove the phase interferences,
by RF phase modulation and/or phase correction during reconstruction, thus
decoupling intra-slab and inter-slab encodings that are otherwise entangled. In
vivo experiments are performed to validate the blipped-SMSlab method, and
preliminarily evaluate its performance in high-resolution dMRI compared with
traditional 2D imaging.
  Results: In the 4D k-space framework, inter-slab and intra-slab phase
interferences of blipped-SMSlab are successfully removed using the proposed
strategies. Compared with non-CAIPI sampling, the blipped-SMSlab acquisition
reduces the g-factor and g-factor-related SNR penalty by about 12%. In
addition, in vivo experiments show the SNR advantage of blipped-SMSlab dMRI
over traditional 2D dMRI for 1.3 and 1.0 mm isotropic resolution imaging with
matched acquisition time.
  Conclusion: Removing inter-slab and intra-slab phase interferences enables
SMSlab dMRI with blipped-CAIPI in a 4D k-space framework. The proposed
blipped-SMSlab dMRI is demonstrated to be more SNR-efficient than 2D dMRI and
thus capable of high-quality, high-resolution fiber orientation detection.

manner to elementary features, such as searching for all redder items or the
reddest item, supporting a relational theory of visual attention. However, in
previous studies, the conditions were often conducive for relational search,
allowing successfully selecting the target relationally on 50% of trials or
more. Moreover, the search displays were often only sparsely populated and
presented repeatedly, rendering it possible that relational search was based on
context learning and not spontaneous. The present study tested the shape of the
attentional tuning function in 36-item search displays, when the target never
had a maximal feature value (e.g., was never the reddest or yellowest item),
and when only the target colour but not the context colour was known. The first
fixations on a trial showed that these displays still reliably evoked
relational search, even when participants had no advance information about the
context and no on-task training. Context learning further strengthened
relational tuning on subsequent trials, but was not necessary for relational
search. Analysing the progression of visual search within a singe trial showed
that attention is first guided to the relationally maximal item (e.g.,
reddest), then the next-maximal (e.g., next-reddest) item, and so forth, before
attention can hone in on target-matching features. In sum, the results support
two tenets of the relational account, that information about the dominant
feature in a display can be rapidly extracted and used to guide attention to
the relatively best-matching features.

Specifically, we propose two innovative designs, i.e., Locality-Perceptive

handle the many-to-many relationship between textual expressions and visual
objects. LPA embeds the local spatial priors into attention modeling, i.e., a
pixel may belong to multiple masks at different scales, thereby improving
segmentation. To help understand the complex semantic relationships, SAL
proposes a bidirectional contrastive objective to regularize the semantic
consistency inter modalities. Extensive experiments on the PNG benchmark
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Compared to
the single-stage baseline, our method achieves a significant improvement of up
to 9.4% accuracy. More importantly, our EPNG is 10 times faster than the
two-stage model. Meanwhile, the generalization ability of EPNG is also
validated by zero-shot experiments on other grounding tasks.

behaviors when interfacial flow is introduced. Motivated by previous
experimental observations, the failure pattern of particle rafts under uniform
radial expansion is reported in this paper. The expansion process is
specifically designed to expand the system affinely in the radial direction and
to keep the velocity gradient constant throughout. A strong resemblance to the
results of particle rafts under uniform uniaxial expansion[1] is found. The
size of the cluster emerging as the rafts are pulled apart scales inversely
with the pulling velocity. This is a result of two competing velocities: the
inter-particle separation speed provided by the flow and a size-dependent
relaxation speed for clustering. A model, generalized from a one-dimensional
linear (in)stability calculation, is in agreement with the failure morphology
found for this radially expanded system. Nonlinear relaxation and particle
rearrangement is observed after the initial clustering occurs. This is a
feature unique to a two-dimensional system. With its easily accessible particle

causal inference and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a popular choice to
represent the causal relationships. As one can recover a causal graph only up
to its Markov equivalence class from observations, interventions are often used
for the recovery task. Interventions are costly in general and it is important
to design algorithms that minimize the number of interventions performed. In
this work, we study the problem of identifying the smallest set of
interventions required to learn the causal relationships between a subset of
edges (target edges). Under the assumptions of faithfulness, causal
sufficiency, and ideal interventions, we study this problem in two settings:
when the underlying ground truth causal graph is known (subset verification)
and when it is unknown (subset search). For the subset verification problem, we
provide an efficient algorithm to compute a minimum sized interventional set;
we further extend these results to bounded size non-atomic interventions and
node-dependent interventional costs. For the subset search problem, in the
worst case, we show that no algorithm (even with adaptivity or randomization)
can achieve an approximation ratio that is asymptotically better than the
vertex cover of the target edges when compared with the subset verification
number. This result is surprising as there exists a logarithmic approximation
algorithm for the search problem when we wish to recover the whole causal
graph. To obtain our results, we prove several interesting structural
properties of interventional causal graphs that we believe have applications
beyond the subset verification/search problems studied here.

existing deep learning-based shadow removal methods still produce images with
shadow remnants. These shadow remnants typically exist in homogeneous regions
with low intensity values, making them untraceable in the existing
image-to-image mapping paradigm. We observe from our experiments that shadows
mainly degrade object colors at the image structure level (in which humans
perceive object outlines filled with continuous colors). Hence, in this paper,
we propose to remove shadows at the image structure level. Based on this idea,
we propose a novel structure-informed shadow removal network (StructNet) to
leverage the image structure information to address the shadow remnant problem.
Specifically, StructNet first reconstructs the structure information of the
input image without shadows and then uses the restored shadow-free structure
prior to guiding the image-level shadow removal. StructNet contains two main
novel modules: (1) a mask-guided shadow-free extraction (MSFE) module to
extract image structural features in a non-shadow to shadow directional manner,
and (2) a multi-scale feature & residual aggregation (MFRA) module to leverage
the shadow-free structure information to regularize feature consistency. In
addition, we also propose to extend StructNet to exploit multi-level structure
information (MStructNet), to further boost the shadow removal performance with
minimum computational overheads. Extensive experiments on three shadow removal
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing shadow removal
methods, and our StructNet can be integrated with existing methods to boost
their performances further.

continuous one and applying the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method, an efficient
Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In our previous studies, we have used a
mixture of normal distributions for the prior distribution. In this study, we
propose using a mixture of t-distributions, which further improves detection
performance. Based on our theoretical analysis and computer simulations, the
proposed method can achieve near-optimal signal detection with polynomial
computational complexity. This high-performance and practical MIMO signal
detection could contribute to the development of the 6th-generation mobile
network.

directional and adaptive beamforming in today's mmWave systems have opened new
possibilities for self-backhauling. Tapping into this potential, 3GPP has
standardized Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) allowing the same base

cost-effective and flexible, resource allocation and path selection in IAB
mmWave networks is a formidable task. To date, prior works have addressed this

generally optimizing a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) such as throughput,

ensures reliability by minimizing the losses in the tail of the performance
distribution. We develop a novel simulator and show via extensive simulations
that Safehaul not only reduces the latency by up to 43.2% compared to the

tumor cells, is a sign of increased mortality. However, metastatic LNs are
time-consuming and challenging to detect even for professional radiologists due
to their small sizes, high sparsity, and ambiguity in appearance. It is desired
to leverage recent development in deep learning to automatically detect
metastatic LNs. Besides a two-stage detection network, we here introduce an
additional branch to leverage information about LN stations, an important
reference for radiologists during metastatic LN diagnosis, as supplementary
information for metastatic LN detection. The branch targets to solve a closely
related task on the LN station level, i.e., classifying whether an LN station
contains metastatic LN or not, so as to learn representations for LN stations.
Considering that a metastatic LN station is expected to significantly affect
the nearby ones, a GCN-based structure is adopted by the branch to model the
relationship among different LN stations. At the classification stage of
metastatic LN detection, the above learned LN station features, as well as the
features reflecting the distance between the LN candidate and the LN stations,
are integrated with the LN features. We validate our method on a dataset

one extending MI attacks to audio data, and our results highlight the security
risks resulting from the extraction of the biometric data in that setup.

leading to privacy-related concerns. Recent regulations like the European GDPR
provide rules for the processing of personal and sensitive data, like that no
such data may be leaked without the consent of the user.
  Researchers have proposed sophisticated approaches to track sensitive data
within mobile apps, all of which rely on specific lists of sensitive source and
sink API methods. The data flow analysis results greatly depend on these lists'
quality. Previous approaches either used incomplete hand-written lists that
quickly became outdated or relied on machine learning. The latter, however,
leads to numerous false positives, as we show.
  This paper introduces CoDoC, a tool that aims to revive the machine-learning
approach to precisely identify privacy-related source and sink API methods. In
contrast to previous approaches, CoDoC uses deep learning techniques and
combines the source code with the documentation of API methods. Firstly, we
propose novel definitions that clarify the concepts of sensitive source and
sink methods. Secondly, based on these definitions, we build a new ground truth
of Android methods representing sensitive source, sink, and neither (i.e., no
source or sink) methods that will be used to train our classifier.
  We evaluate CoDoC and show that, on our validation dataset, it achieves a
precision, recall, and F1 score of 91% in 10-fold cross-validation,
outperforming the state-of-the-art SuSi when used on the same dataset. However,
similarly to existing tools, we show that in the wild, i.e., with unseen data,
CoDoC performs poorly and generates many false positive results. Our findings,
together with time-tested results of previous approaches, suggest that
machine-learning models for abstract concepts such as privacy fail in practice

The dissipative dynamics of these quadratic open fermionic systems is captured
by a non-Hermitian single-particle matrix which contains both the internal
dynamics and the dissipation, refereed to as damping matrix $X$. And the dark
states in these systems are the eigenmodes of $X$ which the eigenvalues'
imaginary part vanishes. However, there is a constraint on $X$, namely that the
modes in which the eigenvalues' imaginary parts are positive are forbidden. In
other words, the imaginary line-gap of $X$ is ill-defined, so the topological
band theory classifying the dark states can not be applied to $X$. To reveal
the topological protection of EDS, we propose the double damping matrix
$\tilde{X} = \text{diag}\left( X, X^* \right)$, where the imaginary line-gap is
well defined. Thus, the 38-fold way can be applied to $\tilde{X}$, and the
topological protection of the EDS is uncovered. Different from previous studies
of EDS in purely dissipative dynamics, the EDS in the dissipative TIs are
robust against the inclusion of Hamiltonians. Furthermore, the topological
classification of $\tilde{X}$ not only reflects the topological protection of
EDS in dissipative TIs but also provides a paradigm to predict the appearance
of EDS in other open free fermionic systems.

coincide with orbital phases $3.36 \pm 0.11$ deg (NRS1) and $2.66 \pm 0.12$ deg

planet-to-star emission ratios of $3,924 \pm 7$ ppm (NRS1) and $4,924 \pm 9$

However, the full spectrum of challenges of egocentric tracking faced by an
embodied AI is underrepresented in many existing datasets; these tend to focus
on relatively short, third-person videos. Egocentric video has several
distinguishing characteristics from those commonly found in past datasets:
frequent large camera motions and hand interactions with objects commonly lead
to occlusions or objects exiting the frame, and object appearance can change
rapidly due to widely different points of view, scale, or object states.
Embodied tracking is also naturally long-term, and being able to consistently
(re-)associate objects to their appearances and disappearances over as long as
a lifetime is critical. Previous datasets under-emphasize this re-detection
problem, and their ""framed"" nature has led to adoption of various
spatiotemporal priors that we find do not necessarily generalize to egocentric
video. We thus introduce EgoTracks, a new dataset for long-term egocentric
visual object tracking. Sourced from the Ego4D dataset, this new dataset
presents a significant challenge to recent state-of-the-art single-object
tracking models, which we find score poorly on traditional tracking metrics for
our new dataset, compared to popular benchmarks. We further show improvements
that can be made to a STARK tracker to significantly increase its performance
on egocentric data, resulting in a baseline model we call EgoSTARK. We publicly
release our annotations and benchmark, hoping our dataset leads to further
advancements in tracking.

solutions for the population balance equations such as Smoluchowski's
coagulation, fragmentation, coupled coagulation-fragmentation and bivariate
coagulation equations. An accelerated form of the HPM is combined with the
Elzaki transformation to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the method. One
of the significant advantages of the technique lies over the classic numerical
methods as it allows solving the linear and non-linear differential equations
without discretization. Further, it has benefits over the existing
semi-analytical techniques such as Adomian decomposition method (ADM),
optimized decomposition method (ODM), and homotopy analysis method (HAM) in the
sense that computation of Adomian polynomials and convergence parameters are
not required. The novelty of the scheme is shown by comparing the numerical
findings with the existing results obtained via ADM, HPM, HAM and ODM for
non-linear coagulation equation. This motivates us to extend the scheme for
solving the other models mentioned above. The supremacy of the proposed scheme
is demonstrated by taking several numerical examples for each problem. The
error between exact and series solutions provided in graphs and tables show the
accuracy and applicability of the method. In addition to this, convergence of
the series solution is also the key attraction of the work.

automate the information creation process while fulfilling the personalized
requirements of users. However, due to the instability of AIGC models, e.g.,
the stochastic nature of diffusion models, the quality and accuracy of the
generated content can vary significantly. In wireless edge networks, the
transmission of incorrectly generated content may unnecessarily consume network
resources. Thus, a dynamic AIGC service provider (ASP) selection scheme is
required to enable users to connect to the most suited ASP, improving the
users' satisfaction and quality of generated content. In this article, we first
review the AIGC techniques and their applications in wireless networks. We then
present the AIGC-as-a-service (AaaS) concept and discuss the challenges in
deploying AaaS at the edge networks. Yet, it is essential to have performance
metrics to evaluate the accuracy of AIGC services. Thus, we introduce several
image-based perceived quality evaluation metrics. Then, we propose a general
and effective model to illustrate the relationship between computational
resources and user-perceived quality evaluation metrics. To achieve efficient
AaaS and maximize the quality of generated content in wireless edge networks,
we propose a deep reinforcement learning-enabled algorithm for optimal ASP
selection. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can provide a
higher quality of generated content to users and achieve fewer crashed tasks by
comparing with four benchmarks, i.e., overloading-avoidance, random,
round-robin policies, and the upper-bound schemes.

effort required for applying formal specification and verification techniques

years, the tremendous progress with SAT and SMT solvers enabled the
construction of a new generation of tools that promise to make formal
verification more accessible for software engineers, by automating most if not
all of the verification process. The Dafny system is a prominent example of
that trend. However, little evidence exists yet about its accessibility. To
help fill this gap, we conducted a set of 10 case studies of developing
verified implementations in Dafny of some real-world algorithms and data
structures, to determine its accessibility for software engineers. We found
that, on average, the amount of code written for specification and verification
purposes is of the same order of magnitude as the traditional code written for
implementation and testing purposes (ratio of 1.14) -- an ``overhead'' that
certainly pays off for high-integrity software. The performance of the Dafny
verifier was impressive, with 2.4 proof obligations generated per line of code
written, and 24 ms spent per proof obligation generated and verified, on
average. However, we also found that the manual work needed in writing
auxiliary verification code may be significant and difficult to predict and
master. Hence, further automation and systematization of verification tasks are
possible directions for future advances in the field.

thereby undermine the honesty and authenticity of online shopping environments.
So far, various fake review classifiers have been proposed that take into
account the actual content of the review. To improve the accuracies of existing
fake review classification or detection approaches, we propose to use BERT
(Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) model to extract word
embeddings from texts (i.e. reviews). Word embeddings are obtained in various
basic methods such as SVM (Support vector machine), Random Forests, Naive
Bayes, and others. The confusion matrix method was also taken into account to
evaluate and graphically represent the results. The results indicate that the
SVM classifiers outperform the others in terms of accuracy and f1-score with an
accuracy of 87.81%, which is 7.6% higher than the classifier used in the
previous study [5].

deep reversible Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to perform flow sensing (flow

asynchronously operate a loop controlling the high-order modes digging a DH and
a control loop that uses the rejected light by a Lyot coronagraph with a

waveguide: leading to super and subradiant coupling even when the emitters are
distant. The incorporation of chiral effects, for example unidirectional
emission of dipole emitters, has already led to rich physics such as dimer
coupling. However, chirality is not the only effect of the dipole, as we
explore from a phase singularity perspective. We demonstrate that control of
the dipole allows a rich variety of control of the phase and amplitude of the
scattered light in both directions. This expands the scope for the physics of
1D chains of emitters.

services depend increasingly on wireless connectivity. Therefore, it is
important to quantify the resilience of existing cellular network
infrastructures against potential risks, ranging from natural disasters to
security attacks, that might occur with a low probability but can lead to
severe disruption of the services. In this paper, we combine models with public
data from national bodies on mobile network operator (MNO) infrastructures,
population distribution, and urbanity level to assess the coverage and capacity
of a cellular network at a country scale. Our analysis offers insights on the
potential weak points that need improvement to ensure a low fraction of
disconnected population (FDP) and high fraction of satisfied population (FSP).
As a resilience improvement approach, we investigate in which regions and to
what extent each MNO can benefit from infrastructure sharing or national
roaming, i.e., all MNOs act as a single national operator. As our case study,
we focus on Dutch cellular infrastructure and model risks as random failures,
correlated failures in a geographic region, and abrupt increase in the number
of users. Our analysis shows that there is a wide performance difference across
MNOs and geographic regions in terms of FDP and FSP. However, national roaming
consistently offers significant benefits, e.g., up to 13% improvement in FDP
and up to 55% in FSP when the networks function without any failures.

investigate precession-driven flows in ellipsoids subject to stress-free
boundary conditions (SF-BC). The SF-BC could indeed unlock numerical
constraints associated with the no-slip boundary conditions (NS-BC), but are
also relevant for some astrophysical applications. Although SF-BC have been
employed in the pioneering work of Lorenzani & Tilgner (J. Fluid Mech., 2003,
492, pp. 363--379), they have scarcely been used due to the discovery of some
specific mathematical issues associated with angular momentum conservation. We
revisit the problem using asymptotic analysis in the low-viscosity regime,
which is validated with numerical simulations. First, we extend the reduced
model of uniform-vorticity flows in ellipsoids to account for SF-BC. We show
that the long-term evolution of angular momentum is affected by viscosity in
triaxial geometries, but also in axisymmetric ellipsoids when the mean rotation
axis of the fluid is not the symmetry axis. In a regime relevant to planets, we
analytically obtain the primary forced flow in triaxial geometries, which
exhibits a second inviscid resonance. Then, we investigate the bulk
instabilities existing in precessing ellipsoids. We show that using SF-BC would
be useful to explore the non-viscous instabilities (e.g. Kerswell, Geophys.

from the X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) effect, where the phase of
the magnetization precession of each magnetic layer with respect to the
exciting radio frequency is obtained using stroboscopic probing of the spin
precession. Measurement of both amplitude and phase response in the magnetic
layers as a function of bias field can give a clear signature of spin-transfer
torque (STT) coupling between ferromagnetic layers due to spin pumping. Over
the last few years, there have been new developments utilizing X-ray scattering
techniques to reveal the precessional magnetization dynamics of ordered spin
structures in the GHz frequency range. The techniques of diffraction and
reflectometry ferromagnetic resonance (DFMR and RFMR) provide novel ways for
the probing of the dynamics of chiral and multilayered magnetic materials,

continuous spectral density of waves either randomly interacting or scattered
by the fine structure of a medium. In a wide range of systems, the wave kinetic
equation is derived from a fundamental equation of wave motion, which is
symmetric through time-reversal. By contrast, the corresponding wave kinetic
equation is time-irreversible. A similar paradox appears whenever one makes a
mesoscopic description of the evolution of a very large number of microscopic
degrees of freedom. Recently, it has been understood that the kinetic
description itself, at a mesoscopic level, should not break time-reversal
symmetry. The proper theoretical or mathematical tool to derive a mesoscopic
time-reversal stochastic process is large deviation theory, for which the
deterministic wave kinetic equation appears as the most probable evolution.
This paper follows Bouchet (2020) and a series of other works that derive the
large deviation Hamiltonians of the classical kinetic theories. We propose a
derivation of the large deviation principle for the linear scattering of waves
by a weak random potential in an inhomogeneous situation. This problem involves
microscopic scales corresponding to the typical wavelengths and periods of the
waves and mesoscopic ones which are the scales of spatial inhomogeneities in
the spectral density and the time needed for the random scatterers to alter the
wave spectrum. The main assumption of the kinetic regime is a large separation
of these microscopic and mesoscopic scales. We choose a generic model of wave
scattering by weak disorder: the Schr\""odinger equation with a random
potential. We derive the path large deviation principle for the local spectral
density and discuss its main properties. We show that the mesoscopic process
obeys a time-reversal symmetry at the level of large deviations. (abridged)

pedestal plasma with a sheared poloidal flow, is developed. This theory reveals
that the separate spatially uniform Fourier modes of the electrostatic
responses of the ions and of the electrons on the mesoscale convective flows
are determined only in the frames of references moved with velocities of the
ion and electron convective flows. In the laboratory frame, these modes are
observed as the compressed-sheared modes with time dependent wave numbers. The
integral equation, which governs the separate Fourier mode of the electrostatic
potential of the plasma species responses on the mesoscale convective flows, is
derived. In this equation, the effects of the compressing and shearing of the
convective flows are revealed as the time dependence of the finite ion Larmor
radius effect. The solution of this equation for the kinetic drift instability
displays the nonmodal transformation of the potential to the zero frequency
cell-like perturbation when time elapsed.

time-domain data. Furthermore, the temporal sampling in measurements needs to
be high enough to capture the TPSF, but this rate can be achieved with standard

affect significantly on image quality. In this work, a prototype time-domain

constructed. The system consisted of a nanosecond Nd-YAG laser combined with

are formed under Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) conditions. In the
presence of oscillations, changes in the opacity impact the response height of
the spectral lines and hinder the determination of the real properties of the
fluctuations. We aim to explore the relationship between the chromospheric
oscillations inferred by NLTE inversion codes and the waves' intrinsic
fluctuations in velocity and temperature. Numerical simulations of wave
propagation in an umbra have been computed with the code MANCHA. The NLTE
synthesis and inversion code NICOLE has been used to compute
spectropolarimetric Ca II 8542 \AA\ line profiles for the models obtained from
the simulations. The synthetic profiles have been inverted and the inferences
from the inversions have been compared with the known simulated atmospheres.
NLTE inversions of the Ca II 8542 \AA\ line capture low-frequency oscillations,
including those in the main band of chromospheric oscillations around 6 mHz. In
contrast, waves with frequencies above 9 mHz are poorly characterized. Velocity
oscillations at those higher frequencies exhibit clear indications of opacity
fluctuations. The main response of the line to velocity fluctuations comes from
low chromospheric heights, whereas the response to temperature shows sudden
jumps between the high photosphere and the low chromosphere. This strong
variation in the heights where the line is sensitive to temperature is revealed
as a strong oscillatory power in the inferred fluctuations. Our results
validate the use of NLTE inversions to study chromospheric oscillations with
frequencies below 9 mHz. The interpretation of higher frequency oscillations
and the power of temperature oscillations must be addressed with care since
they exhibit signatures of opacity oscillations.

the proposed BD-RIS supports the hybrid reflecting and transmitting mode, and
is compatible with flexible single/group/fully-connected architectures,
enabling the system to realize full-space coverage. To achieve the expected
benefits, we jointly optimize the transmit waveform, the BD-RIS coefficients,
and sensing receive filters, by maximizing the minimum
signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio for fair target detection, subject to the
constraints of the communication quality of service, different BD-RIS
architectures and power budget. To solve the non-convex and non-smooth max-min
problem, a general solution based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers is provided for all considered BD-RIS architectures. Numerical
simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and show the
superiority of the BD-RIS aided DFRC system in terms of both communication and
sensing compared to conventional RIS aided DFRC.

technique to enable and enhance future wireless communications due to its
potential to engineer the wireless channels in a cost-effective manner.
Extensive research attention has been drawn to the use of conventional RIS 1.0
with diagonal phase shift matrices, where each RIS element is connected to its
own load to ground but not connected to other elements. However, the simple
architecture of RIS 1.0 limits its flexibility of manipulating passive
beamforming. To fully exploit the benefits of RIS, in this paper, we introduce
RIS 2.0 beyond diagonal phase shift matrices, namely beyond diagonal RIS
(BD-RIS). We first explain the modeling of BD-RIS based on the scattering
parameter network analysis and classify BD-RIS by the mathematical
characteristics of the scattering matrix, supported modes, and architectures.
Then, we provide simulations to evaluate the sum-rate performance with
different modes/architectures of BD-RIS. We summarize the benefits of BD-RIS in
providing high flexibility in wave manipulation, enlarging coverage,
facilitating the deployment, and requiring low complexity in resolution bit and
element numbers. Inspired by the benefits of BD-RIS, we also discuss potential
applications of BD-RIS in various wireless systems. Finally, we list key
challenges in modeling, designing, and implementing BD-RIS in practice and
point to possible future research directions for BD-RIS.

undergoing several collisions per orbit. Their collective behaviour generates a
remarkable array of structure over many orders of magnitude, much of it not
well understood. On the other hand, the collisional properties and parameters
of individual ring particles are poorly constrained; usually N-body simulations
and kinetic theory employ hard-sphere models with a coefficient of restitution
$\epsilon$ that is constant or a decreasing function of impact speed. Due to
plastic deformation of surface regolith, however, it is likely that $\epsilon$
will be more complicated, at the very least a non-monotonic function. We
undertake N-body simulations with the REBOUND code with non-monotonic
$\epsilon$ laws to approximate surfaces that are friable but not sticking. Our
simulations reveal that such ring models can support two thermally stable
steady states for the same (dynamical) optical depth: a cold and a warm state.
If the ring breaks up into radial bands of one or the other state, we find that
warmer states tend to migrate into the colder states via a coherent travelling
front. We also find stationary `viscous' fronts, which connect states of
different optical depth, but the same angular momentum flux. We discuss these
preliminary results and speculate on their implications for structure formation
in Saturn's B and C-rings, especially with respect to structures that appear in
Cassini images but not in occultations.

on some Pareto optimizers, recent work has shifted from tuning for a single,
time-related performance objective to two intrinsically different objectives
that assess distinct performance aspects of the system, each with varying
aspirations. Before we design better optimizers, a crucial engineering decision
to make therein is how to handle the performance requirements with clear
aspirations in the tuning process. For this, the community takes two
alternative optimization models: either quantifying and incorporating the
aspirations into the search objectives that guide the tuning, or not
considering the aspirations during the search but purely using them in the
later decision-making process only. However, despite being a crucial decision
that determines how an optimizer can be designed and tailored, there is a
rather limited understanding of which optimization model should be chosen under
what particular circumstance, and why.
  In this paper, we seek to close this gap. Firstly, we do that through a
review of over 426 papers in the literature and 14 real-world requirements
datasets. Drawing on these, we then conduct a comprehensive empirical study
that covers 15 combinations of the state-of-the-art performance requirement
patterns, four types of aspiration space, three Pareto optimizers, and eight
real-world systems/environments, leading to 1,296 cases of investigation. We
found that (1) the realism of aspirations is the key factor that determines
whether they should be used to guide the tuning; (2) the given patterns and the
position of the realistic aspirations in the objective landscape are less
important for the choice, but they do matter to the extents of improvement; (3)
the available tuning budget can also influence the choice for unrealistic
aspirations but it is insignificant under realistic ones.

engineering of topological phenomena on the macroscopic scale. For the inverse
design of 3D TMs in continuum medium, however, it would be extremely difficult
to classify the topological properties, tackle the computational complexity,
and search solutions in an infinite parameter space. This work proposed a
systematic design framework for the 3D mechanical higher-order topological
insulators (HOTIs) by combining the symmetry indicators (SI) method and the
moving morphable components (MMC) method. The 3D unit cells are described by
the MMC method with only tens of design variables. By evaluating the inherent
singularity properties in the 3D mechanical system, the classic formulas of
topological invariants are modified accordingly for elastic waves. Then a
mathematical formulation is proposed for designing the helical multipole
topological insulators (MTIs) featured corner states and helical energy fluxes,
by constraining the corresponding topological invariants and maximizing the
width of band gap. Mechanical helical HOTIs with different symmetries are
obtained by this method and verified by full wave simulations. This design
paradigm can be further extended to design 3D TMs among different symmetry
classes and space groups, and different physical systems.

negatives and positives alike. Often observational studies focus on the stars
remaining bound. However, they quickly lose the memory of the pre-gas expulsion
phase due to interactions with other cluster members. Our study shows that the
unbound stars hold the key to charting a cluster's dynamic history.
Backtracking unbound stars can provide the original cluster size and determine
the time of gas expulsion. This information is lost in the bound population. In
addition, former members are often better indicators for disc lifetimes or
initial binary fractions. We apply the backtracking analysis, with varying
success, to the clusters: Upper Scorpius and NGC 6530. For highly substructured
clusters such as Upper Scorpius, backtracking to the individual subcluster

a set of well-converged and welldistributed feasible solutions. To complete
this goal, there should be a tradeoff among feasibility, diversity, and
convergence. However, it is nontrivial to balance these three elements
simultaneously by using a single tradeoff model since the importance of each
element varies in different evolutionary phases. As an alternative, we adapt
different tradeoff models in different phases and propose a novel algorithm
called ATM-R. In the infeasible phase, ATM-R takes the tradeoff between
diversity and feasibility into account, aiming to move the population toward
feasible regions from diverse search directions. In the semi-feasible phase,
ATM-R promotes the transition from ""the tradeoff between feasibility and
diversity"" to ""the tradeoff between diversity and convergence"", which can
facilitate the discovering of enough feasible regions and speed up the search
for the feasible Pareto optima in succession. In the feasible phase, the
tradeoff between diversity and convergence is considered to attain a set of
well-converged and well-distributed feasible solutions. It is worth noting that
the merits of reference points are leveraged in ATM-R to accomplish these
tradeoff models. Also, in ATM-R, a multiphase mating selection strategy is
developed to generate promising solutions beneficial to different evolutionary
phases. Systemic experiments on a wide range of benchmark test functions
demonstrate that ATM-R is effective and competitive, compared against five
state-of-the-art constrained multiobjective optimization evolutionary
algorithms.

individually under the episodic meta-learning regime and then performing
temporal alignment to match query and support videos. However, they still
suffer from two drawbacks: (i) learning individual features without considering
the entire task may result in limited representation capability, and (ii)
existing alignment strategies are sensitive to noises and misaligned instances.
To handle the two limitations, we propose a novel Hybrid Relation guided
temporal Set Matching (HyRSM++) approach for few-shot action recognition. The
core idea of HyRSM++ is to integrate all videos within the task to learn
discriminative representations and involve a robust matching technique. To be
specific, HyRSM++ consists of two key components, a hybrid relation module and
a temporal set matching metric. Given the basic representations from the
feature extractor, the hybrid relation module is introduced to fully exploit
associated relations within and cross videos in an episodic task and thus can
learn task-specific embeddings. Subsequently, in the temporal set matching
metric, we carry out the distance measure between query and support videos from
a set matching perspective and design a Bi-MHM to improve the resilience to
misaligned instances. In addition, we explicitly exploit the temporal coherence
in videos to regularize the matching process. Furthermore, we extend the
proposed HyRSM++ to deal with the more challenging semi-supervised few-shot
action recognition and unsupervised few-shot action recognition tasks.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under various few-shot settings. The

However, the direct control of individual EVs is challenging due to their small

that interacts with the grid on behalf of EVs by characterizing their aggregate
flexibility. In this paper, we focus on the aggregate EV power flexibility

trajectory within the region is feasible. Then, considering that parameters
such as real-time electricity prices and EV arrival/departure times are not

optimization techniques. We prove that the charging time delays for EVs always
meet the requirement even if they are not considered explicitly. Furthermore,
real-time feedback is designed and integrated into the proposed online

paper compares three statistical models' assessment of a data example that
appears in several epidemiology textbooks to illustrate biological interaction
in a binomial outcome. A linear binomial model quantifies departure from
additivity in the data example in terms of differences in probabilities. It
generates directly interpretable estimates and 95% confidence intervals for
parameters including the interaction contrast (IC). Log binomial and logistic
regression models detect no departure from multiplicativity in the data
example. However, their estimates contribute to calculation of a ""Relative
Excess Risk Due to Interaction"" (RERI), a measure of departure from additivity
on a relative risk scale. The linear binomial model directly produces
interpretable assessments of departures from additivity of effects and deserves
wider use in research and in the teaching of epidemiology. Strategies exist to
address the model's limitations.

turbines as ever more of them are being installed for renewably producing
electricity. The taller the wind turbine the higher the risk that the type of
lightning striking the man-made structure is UL. UL can be much more
destructive than downward lightning due to its long lasting initial continuous
current leading to a large charge transfer within the lightning discharge
process. Current standards for the risk assessment of lightning at wind
turbines mainly take the summer lightning activity into account, which is
inferred from LLS. Ground truth lightning current measurements reveal that less
than 50% of UL might be detected by lightning location systems (LLS). This
leads to a large underestimation of the proportion of LLS-non-detectable UL at
wind turbines, which is the dominant lightning type in the cold season. This
study aims to assess the risk of LLS-detectable and LLS-non-detectable UL at
wind turbines using direct UL measurements at the Gaisberg Tower (Austria) and
S\""antis Tower (Switzerland). Direct UL observations are linked to
meteorological reanalysis data and joined by random forests, a powerful machine
learning technique. The meteorological drivers for the non-/occurrence of
LLS-detectable and LLS-non-detectable UL, respectively, are found from the
random forest models trained at the towers and have large predictive skill on
independent data. In a second step the results from the tower-trained models
are extended to a larger study domain (Central and Northern Germany). The
tower-trained models for LLS-detectable lightning is independently verified at
wind turbine locations in that domain and found to reliably diagnose that type
of UL. Risk maps based on case study events show that high diagnosed
probabilities in the study domain coincide with actual UL events.

  Paper --",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image denoising (removal of additive white Gaussian noise from an image) is
one of the oldest and most studied problems in image processing. An extensive
work over several decades has led to thousands of papers on this subject, and
to many well-performing algorithms for this task. Indeed, 10 years ago, these
achievements have led some researchers to suspect that ""Denoising is Dead"", in
the sense that all that can be achieved in this domain has already been
obtained. However, this turned out to be far from the truth, with the
penetration of deep learning (DL) into image processing. The era of DL brought
a revolution to image denoising, both by taking the lead in today's ability for
noise removal in images, and by broadening the scope of denoising problems
being treated. Our paper starts by describing this evolution, highlighting in
particular the tension and synergy that exist between classical approaches and
modern DL-based alternatives in design of image denoisers.
  The recent transitions in the field of image denoising go far beyond the
ability to design better denoisers. In the 2nd part of this paper we focus on
recently discovered abilities and prospects of image denoisers. We expose the
possibility of using denoisers to serve other problems, such as regularizing
general inverse problems and serving as the prime engine in diffusion-based
image synthesis. We also unveil the idea that denoising and other inverse
problems might not have a unique solution as common algorithms would have us
believe. Instead, we describe constructive ways to produce randomized and
diverse high quality results for inverse problems, all fueled by the progress
that DL brought to image denoising.
  This survey paper aims to provide a broad view of the history of image
denoising and closely related topics. Our aim is to give a better context to
recent discoveries, and to the influence of DL in our domain.

handedness of a neutrino (antineutrino) at each act of its interaction with a
real or virtual massless pseudoscalar boson, due to which, at the exit from the
Sun, the fluxes of left- and right-handed electron neutrinos become
approximately equal. Thanks to the new interaction, beta decays of nuclei have
a mode with the emission of a massless pseudoscalar boson, at which the
antineutrino changes its handedness and becomes unobservable, what is the
essence of the reactor antineutrino anomaly. The nature of the gallium anomaly

electricity demand of buildings has to react to the fluctuating electricity
generation in view of stability. As buildings consume one-third of global
energy and almost half of this energy accounts for Heating, Ventilation, and
Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems, HVAC are suitable for shifting their
electricity consumption in time. To this end, intelligent control strategies
are necessary as the conventional control of HVAC is not optimized for the
actual demand of occupants and the current situation in the electricity grid.
In this paper, we present the novel multi-zone controller Price Storage Control
(PSC) that not only considers room-individual Occupants' Thermal Satisfaction
(OTS), but also the available energy storage, and energy prices. The main
feature of PSC is that it does not need a building model or forecasts of future
demands to derive the control actions for multiple rooms in a building. For
comparison, we use an ideal, error-free Model Predictive Control (MPC), a
simplified variant without storage consideration (PC), and a conventional
hysteresis-based two-point control. We evaluate the four controllers in a
multi-zone environment for heating a building in winter and consider two
different scenarios that differ in how much the permitted temperatures vary. In
addition, we compare the impact of model parameters with high and low thermal
capacitance. The results show that PSC strongly outperforms the conventional
control approach in both scenarios and for both parameters. For high
capacitance, it leads to 22 % costs reduction while the ideal MPC achieves cost
reductions of more than 39 %. Considering that PSC does not need any building
model or forecast, as opposed to MPC, the results support the suitability of
our developed control strategy for controlling HVAC systems in future energy

signals to be stable, they must honestly inform their audience, and to be
honest, their costs need deter least commited individuals. To account for the
existence of uniform high-cost signals , we design a simple game theory model.
In our model, senders can engage in second-order signaling. They can pay a cost
to express outrage at a non-sender. In doing so, they draw attention to their
own signal, and benefit from its increased visibility. Outrage is therefore a
self-serving behavior performed at the expense of a target. Using our model and

lead signal costs to run away. Second-order signaling such as outrage may
explain why groups sometimes demand displays of commitment from all their

to cooperatively explore an unknown region as fast as possible. Multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) has recently become a trending paradigm for
solving this challenge. However, existing MARL-based methods adopt
action-making steps as the metric for exploration efficiency by assuming all
the agents are acting in a fully synchronous manner: i.e., every single agent
produces an action simultaneously and every single action is executed
instantaneously at each time step. Despite its mathematical simplicity, such a
synchronous MARL formulation can be problematic for real-world robotic
applications. It can be typical that different robots may take slightly
different wall-clock times to accomplish an atomic action or even periodically
get lost due to hardware issues. Simply waiting for every robot being ready for
the next action can be particularly time-inefficient. Therefore, we propose an
asynchronous MARL solution, Asynchronous Coordination Explorer (ACE), to tackle
this real-world challenge. We first extend a classical MARL algorithm,
multi-agent PPO (MAPPO), to the asynchronous setting and additionally apply
action-delay randomization to enforce the learned policy to generalize better
to varying action delays in the real world. Moreover, each navigation agent is
represented as a team-size-invariant CNN-based policy, which greatly benefits
real-robot deployment by handling possible robot lost and allows
bandwidth-efficient intra-agent communication through low-dimensional CNN
features. We first validate our approach in a grid-based scenario. Both
simulation and real-robot results show that ACE reduces over 10% actual
exploration time compared with classical approaches. We also apply our
framework to a high-fidelity visual-based environment, Habitat, achieving 28%
improvement in exploration efficiency.

revealed a weak ergodicity breaking mechanism known as quantum many-body scars,
which is typically a collection of states with low entanglement embedded in
otherwise thermal spectra. Here, by applying a generic formalism, we propose a
direct evolution from the quantum many-body scars to their inverse case and
construct multiple inverted quantum many-body scars, i.e., different sets of
excited states with volume-law entanglement embedded in a sea of the many-body
localized spectrum. When increasing the disorder strength, a tower of exact
eigenstates remain intact, acting as conventional quantum many-body scars at
weak disorder, and each residing inside narrow energy windows with the emerged
inverted quantum many-body scar at strong disorder. Moreover, the strong
disorder also induces additional sets of inverted quantum many-body scars with
their energies concentrating in the middle of the exact eigenstates. As a
result, all the multiple inverted quantum many-body scars are approximately
equidistant in energy. We further examine the stability of the conventional and
the inverted quantum many-body scars against the external random field. Our
findings expand the variety of nonthermal systems and connect the weak

gravitationally lensed supernovae predicted to be found with upcoming

assumed to be independent of properties such as the host galaxy mass. Some
studies hint that a host galaxy mass bias may exist for IIn supernovae. This
paper aims to provide an updated local IIn supernova-to-core-collapse ratio
based on data from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and the Zwicky Transient
Facility (ZTF) Bright Transient Survey (BTS). Furthermore, the goal is to
investigate the dependency of the IIn supernova peak magnitude on the host
galaxy mass and the consequences of a possible host galaxy mass preference on
the volumetric rate of type IIn supernovae. We constructed approximately
volume-limited subsamples to determine the local IIn supernova-to-core-collapse
ratio. We investigated the absolute peak magnitude of a subsample of type IIn
and superluminous II or IIn supernovae exploring how this relates to the i-band
magnitude of the host galaxies (as a proxy for stellar mass). We presented a
method to quantify the effect of a potential preference for low-mass host
galaxies utilizing the UniverseMachine algorithm. The IIn
supernova-to-core-collapse ratios for PTF and BTS are 0.046 +- 0.013 and 0.048

consistent with the ratio of 0.05 currently used to estimate the number of
gravitationally lensed IIn supernovae. We report fainter host galaxy median
absolute magnitudes for type IIn brighter than -20.5 mag with a 3 sigma
significance. If the IIn supernova-to-core-collapse ratio were described by the

transient superdomains convert into the regular ferroelectric domains, the
superdomain boundaries transform into the desired charged domain walls. In
order to assign the observed transient domain patterns, to understand the

well-established platform-based Mobility on Demand (MOD) providers. Such
alliances can improve service quality, coverage, and ridership; reduce public
sector costs and vehicular emissions; and integrate the passenger experience.
To amplify the effectiveness of such alliances, we develop a fare-setting model
that jointly optimizes discounted fares across a multimodal network. We capture
commuters' travel choices with a discrete choice model, resulting in a
large-scale, mixed-integer, non-convex optimization problem. To solve this
challenging problem, we develop a two-stage decomposition with the pricing
decisions in the first stage and a mixed-integer linear optimization problem
optimizing fare discounts and the induced passenger behaviors in the second
stage. To solve the decomposition, we develop a new solution approach combining
tailored coordinate descent, parsimonious second-stage evaluations, and
interpolations using special ordered sets. This approach, enhanced by
acceleration techniques based on slanted traversal, randomization and
warm-start, significantly improves system-wide practical outcomes over
algorithmic benchmarks. Different alliance priorities result in qualitatively
different fare designs: flat fares decrease the total vehicle-miles traveled,
while geographically-informed discounts improve passenger happiness. The model
responds appropriately to equity-oriented and passenger-centric priorities,
improving system utilization and lowering prices for low-income residents and
long-distance commuters. Finally, our revenue allocation mechanism improves
outcomes for both operators, thus incentivizing profit-oriented MOD operators
to adopt transit priorities.

some high extinction cases caused by local dust lanes. We present the lower

applications. However, high-quality graphite can be expensive, limiting the
cost-competitiveness of high-quality graphite technologies. Here, we
investigate the thermal properties of low-cost, low-quality, macro-porous
graphite to determine the tradeoff between cost and thermal performance. We use
laser flash analysis (LFA) to measure the thermal diffusivity of graphite at
high temperatures. However, due to the large pores in the graphite samples
preventing uniform laser flash heating, we must apply a thick coating to
achieve the required flat, parallel surfaces for LFA measurements. The presence
of the coating directly impacts the measured diffusivity, not only because of
the added thickness but also because of the sample/coating interface profile
generated. We therefore develop a methodology based on finite element modeling
of a variety of sample/coating interface profiles to extract properties of the
sample. Validating the methodology against a reference sample demonstrates a
mean absolute percentage error of 8.5%, with potential improvement with better
sample characterization. We show low-cost, low-quality graphite has a thermal
conductivity of ~10 W/m/K up to 1000$^{\circ}$C, which is an order of magnitude
lower than high-quality graphite, but contributions from photon conductivity
may result in higher conductivities at higher temperatures. Overall, we
demonstrate an approach for measuring thermal properties of macro-porous
materials at high temperatures, and apply the approach to measuring thermal
conductivity of porous graphite, which will aid in the design of
high-temperature systems for cost-competitive decarbonization.

to improve sleep staging performance, the sequential modelling approach in
existing state-of-the-art deep learning models are inefficient for that
purpose. We thus introduce a method for efficient long sequence modelling and
propose a new deep learning model, L-SeqSleepNet, which takes into account

four distinct databases of various sizes, we demonstrate state-of-the-art

scalp EEG in conventional Polysomnography (PSG), in-ear EEG, and around-the-ear

that L-SeqSleepNet is able to alleviate the predominance of N2 sleep (the major
class in terms of classification) to bring down errors in other sleep stages.
Moreover the network becomes much more robust, meaning that for all subjects
where the baseline method had exceptionally poor performance, their performance
are improved significantly. Finally, the computation time only grows at a
sub-linear rate when the sequence length increases.

methods to a dialect/standard (or modern) Arabic pair to automatically produce
a standard Arabic text from a dialect input, a process we call ''automatic
standardization''. we opt here for the application of ''statistical models''
because ''automatic standardization'' based on rules is more hard with the lack
of ''diglossic'' dictionaries on the one hand and the difficulty of creating
linguistic rules for each dialect on the other. Carrying out this research
could then lead to combining ''automatic standardization'' software and
automatic translation software so that we take the output of the first software
and introduce it as input into the second one to obtain at the end a quality
machine translation. This approach may also have educational applications such
as the development of applications to help understand different Arabic dialects
by transforming dialectal texts into standard Arabic.

here, in which $N$ servers help to compute the real-valued functions requested
by $K$ users, where each function can be written as a linear combination of up
to $L$ (generally non-linear) subfunctions. Each server computes a fraction
$\gamma$ of the subfunctions, then communicates a function of its computed

recover its desired function. Our goal is to bound the ratio between the
computation workload done by all servers over the number of datasets. To this
end, we here reformulate the real-valued distributed computing problem into a
matrix factorization problem and then into a basic sparse recovery problem,
where sparsity implies computational savings. Building on this, we first give a
simple probabilistic scheme for subfunction assignment, which allows us to
upper bound the optimal normalized computation cost as $\gamma \leq
\frac{K}{N}$ that a generally intractable $\ell_0$-minimization would give. To
bypass the intractability of such optimal scheme, we show that if these optimal
schemes enjoy $\gamma \leq - r\frac{K}{N}W^{-1}_{-1}(- \frac{2K}{e N r} )$

communication between servers and users), then they can actually be derived
using a tractable Basis Pursuit $\ell_1$-minimization. This newly-revealed
connection between distributed computation and compressed sensing opens up the
possibility of designing practical distributed computing algorithms by
employing tools and methods from compressed sensing.

FRW universe for any spherically symmetric case and, finally, we obtain the

can be unstable and, due to the quantum tunnelling effect, the spacetime can
undergo a black hole-to-white hole transition (a bouncing Planck star).

different labels provides a hint about the importance of the features where a
and b differ. Following this idea, we introduce the Analogical Relevance Index
(ARI), a new statistical test of the significance of a given feature with
respect to the label. ARI is a filter-based method. Filter-based methods are
ML-agnostic but generally unable to handle feature redundancy. However, ARI can
detect feature redundancy. Our experiments show that ARI is effective and
outperforms well-known methods on a variety of artificial and some real
datasets.

investigated in the range of initial energies where the motion is unbounded. In
this paper we study, with the help of the exit basins and the escape time
distributions, how an external perturbation, be it dissipation or periodic
forcing with a random phase, can enhance or mitigate the unpredictability of a
system that exhibit chaotic scattering. In fact, if basin boundaries have the
Wada property, predictability becomes very complicated, since the basin
boundaries start to intermingle, what means that there are points of different
basins close to each other. The main responsible of this unpredictability is
the external forcing with random phase, while the dissipation can recompose the
basin boundaries and turn the system more predictable. Therefore, we do the
necessary simulations to find out the values of dissipation and external
forcing for which the exit basins present the Wada property. Through these
numerical simulations, we show that the presence of the Wada basins have a
specific relation with the damping, the forcing amplitude and the energy value.
Our approach consists on investigating the dynamics of the system in order to
gain knowledge able to control the unpredictability due to the Wada basins.

  Systems","11 pages, 11 figures article",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY nlin.CD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The power conversion process of a wind turbine can be characterized by a
stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the power output conditioned to
certain fixed wind speeds. An analogous approach can also be applied to the
mechanical loads on a wind turbine, such as generator torque. The constructed
SDE consists of the deterministic and stochastic terms, the latter
corresponding to the highly fluctuating behavior of the wind turbine. Here we
show how advanced stochastic analysis of the noise contribution can be used to
show different operating modes of the conversion process of a wind turbine. The
parameters of the SDE, known as Kramers-Moyal (KM) coefficients, are estimated
directly from the measurement data. Clear evidence is found that both,
continuous diffusion noise and discontinuous jump noise are present. The
difference in the noise contributions indicates different operational regions.
In particular, we observe that the jump character or discontinuity in power
production has a significant contribution in the regions where the control
system switches strategies. We find that there is a high increase in jump
amplitude near the transition to the rated region, and the switching strategies
cannot result in a smooth transition. The proposed analysis provides new
insights to the control strategies of the wind turbine.

forward model is governed by complex partial differential equations (PDEs).
This is typically caused by expensive forward model evaluations and
high-dimensional parameterization of priors. This paper proposes a
domain-decomposed variational auto-encoder Markov chain Monte Carlo
(DD-VAE-MCMC) method to tackle these challenges simultaneously. Through
partitioning the global physical domain into small subdomains, the proposed
method first constructs local deterministic generative models based on local
historical data, which provide efficient local prior representations. Gaussian
process models with active learning address the domain decomposition interface
conditions. Then inversions are conducted on each subdomain independently in
parallel and in low-dimensional latent parameter spaces. The local inference
solutions are post-processed through the Poisson image blending procedure to
result in an efficient global inference result. Numerical examples are provided
to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

city applications. Vehicle-based mobile sensing, or drive-by sensing (DS), is
gaining popularity in both academic research and field practice. The DS
paradigm has an inherent transport component, as the spatial-temporal
distribution of the sensors are closely related to the mobility patterns of
their hosts, which may include third-party (e.g. taxis, buses) or for-hire
(e.g. unmanned aerial vehicles and dedicated vehicles) vehicles. It is
therefore essential to understand, assess and optimize the sensing power of
vehicle fleets under a wide range of urban sensing scenarios. To this end, this
paper offers an optimization-oriented summary of recent literature by
presenting a four-step discussion, namely (1) quantifying the sensing quality
(objective); (2) assessing the sensing power of various fleets (strategic); (3)
sensor deployment (strategic/tactical); and (4) vehicle maneuvers
(tactical/operational). By compiling research findings and practical insights
in this way, this review article not only highlights the optimization aspect of
drive-by sensing, but also serves as a practical guide for configuring and
deploying vehicle-based urban sensing systems.

ratio (SNR) and high inter-subject variability. Multiple techniques have been
proposed to alleviate this problem, such as averaging, denoising source
separation (DSS) and (multiway) canonical correlation analysis ((M)CCA), but
all these methods have significant limitations. We propose a novel paradigm for
the self-supervised enhancement of stimulus-related brain response data.
Different time-aligned stimulus-evoked brain responses to the same stimulus are
randomly shifted in time and independently enhanced. Both enhanced brain
responses are compared using a model that predicts the shift in time between
the brain responses. Using a model based on a multi-view convolutional neural
network as an enhancement module, we show the efficacy of our method for a
downstream task of decoding the speech envelope from auditory EEG. A
significant relative improvement of 32% (p<0.001) was found when using the
enhanced EEG versus normal EEG. While the shown example concerns EEG in
response to auditory stimulation, conceptually, our method applies to other
modalities (such as MEG) and other tasks (such as visual stimulus-response
modelling).

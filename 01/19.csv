to the lack of large-scale realscanned 3D databases. To facilitate the
development of 3D perception, reconstruction, and generation in the real world,
we propose OmniObject3D, a large vocabulary 3D object dataset with massive
high-quality real-scanned 3D objects. OmniObject3D has several appealing
properties: 1) Large Vocabulary: It comprises 6,000 scanned objects in 190
daily categories, sharing common classes with popular 2D datasets (e.g.,
ImageNet and LVIS), benefiting the pursuit of generalizable 3D representations.
2) Rich Annotations: Each 3D object is captured with both 2D and 3D sensors,
providing textured meshes, point clouds, multiview rendered images, and
multiple real-captured videos. 3) Realistic Scans: The professional scanners
support highquality object scans with precise shapes and realistic appearances.
With the vast exploration space offered by OmniObject3D, we carefully set up
four evaluation tracks: a) robust 3D perception, b) novel-view synthesis, c)
neural surface reconstruction, and d) 3D object generation. Extensive studies
are performed on these four benchmarks, revealing new observations, challenges,
and opportunities for future research in realistic 3D vision.

The survey was conducted with the CfA 1.2 m telescope, which at 89 GHz has a
beam width of 11' and a spectral resolution of 0.85 km s$^{-1}$. A total of 8.1
deg$^2$ was surveyed on a uniform 10' grid to a sensitivity of 14 mK per
channel. The survey was compared with similar surveys of CO and dust in order
to study and calibrate the HCN line as a dense gas tracer. We find the HCN
emission to extend over a considerable fraction of the cloud. We show that the
HCN intensity remains linear with H$_2$ column density well into the regime
where the CO line saturates. We use radiative transfer modeling to show that
this likely results from subthermal excitation of HCN in a cloud where the
column and volume densities of H$_2$ are positively correlated. To match our
HCN observations the model requires an exponential decrease in HCN abundance
with increasing extinction, consistent with HCN depletion onto grains. The
modeling also reveals that the mean volume density of H$_2$ in the HCN emitting
regions is $\sim$ 10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, well below the HCN critical density. For
the first time, we obtain a direct measurement of the ratio of dense gas mass
to HCN luminosity for an entire nearby molecular cloud: $\alpha$(HCN) $=$ 92

auxiliary information, such as email addresses, as a proxy signal to predict
the underlying password distribution. Specifically, the model uses deep
learning to capture the correlation between the auxiliary data of a group of
users (e.g., users of a web application) and their passwords. It then exploits
those patterns to create a tailored password model for the target system at
inference time. No further training steps, targeted data collection, or prior
knowledge of the community's password distribution is required. Besides
improving over current password strength estimation techniques and attacks, the
model enables any end-user (e.g., system administrators) to autonomously
generate tailored password models for their systems without the often
unworkable requirements of collecting suitable training data and fitting the

moving unidirectionally along the lattice, whereas high power initial

this case, we numerically construct both stationary and moving coherent
structures, which are solutions reproducing themselves exactly after an integer
multiple of the coupling period. For the stationary solutions, which are true
periodic orbits, we use Floquet analysis to determine the parameter regime for
which they are spectrally stable. Typically, the traveling solutions are
characterized by having small-amplitude, oscillatory tails, although we
identify a set of parameters for which these tails disappear. These parameters
turn out to be independent of the lattice size, and our simulations suggest
that for these parameters, numerically exact traveling solutions are stable.

we propose a unified framework, that incorporates heterogeneous datasets in a

framework first curates heterogeneous datasets to bring them into a common
format and then trains a single-backbone FCN on all of them simultaneously. To
achieve this, it transforms weak annotations, which are incompatible with
semantic segmentation, to per-pixel labels, and hierarchizes their label spaces

variants of local learning can lead to efficient training of modern deep

splitting layers or modules into sub-components, adding a notion of width-wise
modularity to the existing depth-wise modularity associated with local
learning. We investigate local-learning penalties that permit such models to be

greater capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn from these

  In this paper, we identify the root causes of the performance limitations in
existing approaches, and propose techniques to overcome these limitations. With
these techniques, we improve the testing speed over the state-of-the-art by up
to two orders of magnitude.
  These improvements enable us to run a testing campaign of unprecedented depth

wave in a low-beta plasma using one-dimensional fully kinetic simulations. We
focus for the first time on the conversion of the energy stored in the initial
Alfv\'en wave into particle internal energy, and on its partition between
particle species. We show that compressible fluctuations generated by the decay
of the pump wave into a secondary ion-acoustic mode and a reflected Alfv\'en
wave contribute to the gain of internal energy via two distinct mechanisms.
First, the ion-acoustic mode leads nonlinearly to proton trapping and proton
phase space mixing, in agreement with previous work based on hybrid
simulations. Second, during the nonlinear stage, a compressible front of the
fast type develops at the steepened edge of the backward Alfv\'en wave leading
to a field-aligned proton beam propagating backwards at the Alfv\'en speed. We
find that parametric decay heats preferentially protons, which gain about 50%
of the pump wave energy in the form of internal energy. However, we find that
electrons are also energized and that they contribute to the total energy
balance by gaining 10% of the pump wave energy. By investigating energy
partition and particle heating during parametric decay, our results contribute
to determine the role of compressible and kinetic effects in wave-driven models

electron-electron interaction (EEI) by low temperature magnetotransport
measurements for a set of 2D disordered TiN thin films. While cooling down the
sample, a characteristic temperature T* is obtained from the R(T) at which
superconducting fluctuations start to appear. The upturn in R(T) above T*
corresponds to weak localization (WL) and/or EEI. By the temperature and field
dependences of the observed resistance, we show that the upturn in R(T)
originates mainly from EEI with a negligible contribution from WL. Further, we
have used the modified Larkins electron-electron attraction strength
beta(T/Tc), containing a field induced pair breaking parameter, in the
Maki-Thompson (MT) superconducting fluctuation term. Here, the temperature
dependence of the beta(T/Tc) obtained from the magnetoresistance analysis shows
a diverging behavior close to Tc and it remains almost constant at higher
temperature within the limit of ln(T/Tc) < 1. Interestingly, the variation of
beta(T/Tc) on the reduced temperature (T/Tc) offers a common trend which has
been closely followed by all the concerned samples presented in this study.
Finally, the temperature dependence of inverse phase scattering time , as
obtained from the magnetoresistance analysis, clearly shows two different
regimes; the first one close to Tc follows the Ginzburg-Landau relaxation rate
, whereas, the second one at high temperature varies almost linearly with
temperature indicating the dominance of inelastic electron-electron scattering
for the dephasing mechanism. These two regimes are followed in a generic way by
all the samples in spite of being grown under different growth conditions.

  Error With Microphone-dependent Prediction Delays",,,,,"eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the last decades several multi-microphone speech dereverberation
algorithms have been proposed, among which the weighted prediction error (WPE)
algorithm. In the WPE algorithm, a prediction delay is required to reduce the
correlation between the prediction signals and the direct component in the
reference microphone signal. In compact arrays with closely-spaced microphones,
the prediction delay is often chosen microphone-independent. In acoustic sensor
networks with spatially distributed microphones, large
time-differences-of-arrival (TDOAs) of the speech source between the reference
microphone and other microphones typically occur. Hence, when using a
microphone-independent prediction delay the reference and prediction signals
may still be significantly correlated, leading to distortion in the
dereverberated output signal. In order to decorrelate the signals, in this
paper we propose to apply TDOA compensation with respect to the reference
microphone, resulting in microphone-dependent prediction delays for the WPE
algorithm. We consider both optimal TDOA compensation using crossband filtering
in the short-time Fourier transform domain as well as band-to-band and integer
delay approximations. Simulation results for different reverberation times
using oracle as well as estimated TDOAs clearly show the benefit of using
microphone-dependent prediction delays.

greater on the left side than on the right side. In positive valence, the
temperature and blood perfusion increased in some cases, showing a complex

increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the maps. In all cases but one, we do not
detect these transients in the ACT data. The single candidate detection (event
AT2019ppm), seen at ${\sim}5\sigma$ significance in our data, appears to be due
to active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity in the host galaxy coincident with a

(RAN) equipment, and edge infrastructure requires major capital expenses for
mobile network operators. A neutral host infrastructure, where a third-party
company provides RAN services to mobile operators through network
virtualization and slicing techniques, is seen as a promising solution to
decrease these costs. Currently, however, neutral host providers lack automated
and virtualized pipelines for onboarding new tenants and to provide elastic and
on-demand allocation of resources matching operator's demands. To address this
gap, this paper presents NeutRAN, a zero-touch framework based on the O-RAN
architecture to support applications on neutral hosts and automatic operator
onboarding, that enables multiple tenants to access a shared RAN
infrastructure. The NeutRAN architecture builds upon two key components: (i) an
optimization engine to guarantee coverage and meet quality of service
requirements while accounting for the limited amount of shared spectrum and RAN
nodes, and (ii) a fully virtualized and automated infrastructure that converts
the output of the optimization engine into deployable micro-services to be
executed at RAN nodes and cell sites. NeutRAN was prototyped on an OpenShift
cluster and on a programmable testbed with 4 base stations and 10 users from 3
different tenants. We evaluated the benefits of NeutRAN compared to a
traditional license-based RAN where each tenant has dedicated physical and
spectrum resources. Experimental results show that NeutRAN can deploy a fully
operational neutral host-based cellular network in around 10 seconds, and it
increases the cumulative network throughput by 2.18x and the per-user average
throughput by 1.73x with shared spectrum blocks of 30 MHz.

domains. The gold standard solution is to conduct a randomised controlled
trial. However, in many situations such trials cannot be performed. In the
absence of such trials, many methods have been devised to quantify the causal
impact of an intervention from observational data given certain assumptions.
One widely used method are synthetic control models. While identifiability of
the causal estimand in such models has been obtained from a range of
assumptions, it is widely and implicitly assumed that the underlying
assumptions are satisfied for all time periods both pre- and post-intervention.
This is a strong assumption, as synthetic control models can only be learned in
pre-intervention period. In this paper we address this challenge, and prove
identifiability can be obtained without the need for this assumption, by
showing it follows from the principle of invariant causal mechanisms. Moreover,
for the first time, we formulate and study synthetic control models in Pearl's
structural causal model framework. Importantly, we provide a general framework
for sensitivity analysis of synthetic control causal inference to violations of
the assumptions underlying non-parametric identifiability. We end by providing
an empirical demonstration of our sensitivity analysis framework on simulated

resolve the conflict between maximal matter entropy in the early universe and

argues that the scale factor, and with it the overall state, was out of
equilibrium. He illustrates subsequent entropy-increasing interaction with
other degrees of freedom in two models: particles in a box interacting with a
piston initially out of equilibrium and Newtonian gravitating particles.
However, the piston's position and momentum, like the particles"", are defined
relative to the box, while unobservable absolute space defines those of the
gravitating particles. Their representation using observable scale-invariant
variables shows that the box and gravitational statistics differ greatly: in
the latter a single degree of freedom, gravity's creative core, drives the
system in every solution from entropic-like disorder to ever increasing ordered
structure. Since in many ways such particles are a good approximation to
general relativity, this may also be true for our universe.

non-linearly on the initial incidence, the reproduction number $R$, and the
number of matches played. The strongest effects are seen in Scotland and
England, where as much as 10,000 primary cases per million inhabitants occur
from championship-related gatherings. The average match-induced increase in $R$

Over and above methodological hurdles, random sampling has proven an extremely

This work aims to take advantage of the diversity and speed offered by random

""popcorn-like"" or intermittent with duty cycles of order $10^{-3}$. However,
the standard cross-correlation search for stochastic GWBs currently performed
by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration is based on a continuous-Gaussian signal

Reduced-Reference quality metric for point clouds, which is based on
Content-oriented sAliency Projection (RR-CAP). Specifically, we make the first
attempt to simplify reference and distorted point clouds into projected
saliency maps with a downsampling operation. Through this process, we tackle
the issue of transmitting large-volume original point clouds to user-ends for
quality assessment. Then, motivated by the characteristics of the human visual
system (HVS), the objective quality scores of distorted point clouds are
produced by combining content-oriented similarity and statistical correlation
measurements. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on SJTU-PCQA and WPC
databases. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm
outperforms existing reduced-reference and no-reference quality metrics, and
significantly reduces the performance gap between state-of-the-art
full-reference quality assessment methods. In addition, we show the performance
variation of each proposed technical component by ablation tests.

accurate estimation of their channels or the fine adjustment of their narrow
beams. This, however, is typically associated with high channel
acquisition/beam sweeping overhead that scales with the number of antennas.
Machine and deep learning represent promising approaches to overcome these
challenges thanks to their powerful ability to learn from prior observations
and side information. Training machine and deep learning models, however,
requires large-scale datasets that are expensive to collect in deployed
systems. To address this challenge, we propose a novel direction that utilizes
digital replicas of the physical world to reduce or even eliminate the MIMO
channel acquisition overhead. In the proposed digital twin aided communication,
3D models that approximate the real-world communication environment are
constructed and accurate ray-tracing is utilized to simulate the site-specific
channels. These channels can then be used to aid various communication tasks.
Further, we propose to use machine learning to approximate the digital replicas
and reduce the ray tracing computational cost. To evaluate the proposed digital
twin based approach, we conduct a case study focusing on the position-aided
beam prediction task. The results show that a learning model trained solely
with the data generated by the digital replica can achieve relatively good
performance on the real-world data. Moreover, a small number of real-world data
points can quickly achieve near-optimal performance, overcoming the modeling
mismatches between the physical and digital worlds and significantly reducing
the data acquisition overhead.

techniques, high-energy photon emission and electron-positron pair creation
probability rates and energy distributions are calculated within the
locally-constant-field approximation (LCFA) as well as with more advanced
models [Phys. Rev. A 99, 022125 (2019)]. SFQEDtoolkit is designed to provide
users with high-performance and high-accuracy, and neat examples showing its

the angular distribution of the generated particles, i.e., beyond the commonly
employed collinear emission approximation, as well as to model spin and
polarization dependent SFQED processes. Notably, the generality and flexibility
of the presented function approximation approach makes it suitable to be
employed in other areas of physics, chemistry and computer science.

approach where clients are able to update the central model information
theoretically privately. Our approach is based on private set union (PSU),
which is further based on multi-message symmetric private information retrieval
(MM-SPIR). The server has two non-colluding databases which keep the model in a
replicated manner. With our scheme, the server does not get to learn anything
further than the subset of submodels updated by the clients: the server does
not get to know which client updated which submodel(s), or anything about the
local client data. In comparison to the state-of-the-art private FSL schemes of
Jia-Jafar and Vithana-Ulukus, our scheme does not require noisy storage of the
model at the databases; and in comparison to the secure aggregation scheme of
Zhao-Sun, our scheme does not require pre-distribution of client-side common
randomness, instead, our scheme creates the required client-side common
randomness via random SPIR and one-time pads. The protocol starts with a common
randomness generation (CRG) phase where the two databases establish common
randomness at the client-side using RSPIR and one-time pads (this phase is
called FSL-CRG). Next, the clients utilize the established client-side common
randomness to have the server determine privately the union of indices of
submodels to be updated collectively by the clients (this phase is called
FSL-PSU). Then, the two databases broadcast the current versions of the
submodels in the set union to clients. The clients update the submodels based
on their local training data. Finally, the clients use a variation of FSL-PSU
to write the updates back to the databases privately (this phase is called
FSL-write). Our proposed private FSL scheme is robust against client drop-outs,
client late-arrivals, and database drop-outs.

antineutrino coming from $Z_0$ decay are detected, one can observe an
oscillation pattern between the corresponding detectors. This prediction is
based on two properties; the neutrino-antineutrino pairs are produced
coherently and they are detected with definite flavor in detectors. In this
paper, we reanalyze this problem by considering some massive neutrinos which
are mixed with light neutrinos but they either participate incoherently or are
decoupled in the production and detection processes. In fact, neutrinos whose
masses are larger than the upper bound on the mass uncertainty to be compatible
with the coherence conditions (we will see it is about 1 keV) must be treated
incoherently. Very heavy neutrinos whose masses are much larger than the
neutrino energy in the neutrino production process are decoupled. Under these
conditions, the created neutrino-antineutrino state as well as the states of
detected neutrino and antineutrino is mixed. We see that the oscillation
pattern cannot be observed for incoherent neutrinos and the standard
oscillation pattern is recovered if the light neutrino masses are ignored in
the production and detection processes. Moreover, since the $Z_0$ decay process
is performed blindly with respect to flavors, the oscillating contributions in
the event rates are independent of the $Z_0$ decay width.

a method for diagnosing the root cause of functional faults through the lens of
causality. CaRE abstracts the causal relationships between various
configuration options and the robot's performance objectives by learning a
causal structure and estimating the causal effects of options on robot
performance indicators. We demonstrate CaRE's efficacy by finding the root
cause of the observed functional faults and validating the diagnosed root cause
by conducting experiments in both physical robots (Husky and Turtlebot 3) and
in simulation (Gazebo). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the causal models
learned from robots in simulation (e.g., Husky in Gazebo) are transferable to

of star formation. At high redshifts star formation occurs in a series of short
and intense bursts, while at low redshifts star formation proceeds at a steady
rate with a transition from one mode to another at times ranging from 3 to 7
Gyr ago for different galaxies. We analyse how the mode of star formation
affects iron and alpha-element abundance. We find that the early bursty regime
imprints a measurable pattern in stellar elemental abundances in the form of a
""sideways chevron"" shape on the [Fe/H] - [O/Fe] plane and the scatter in [O/Fe]
at a given stellar age is higher than when a galaxy is in the steady regime.
That suggests that the evolution of [O/Fe] scatter with age provides an
estimate of the end of the bursty phase. We investigate the feasibility of
observing of this effect by adding mock observational errors to a simulated
stellar survey and find that the transition between the bursty and steady phase
should be detectable in the Milky Way, although larger observational
uncertainties make the transition shallower. We apply our method to
observations of the Milky Way from the Second APOKASC Catalog and estimate that
the transition to steady star formation in the Milky Way happened 7-8 Gyrs ago,
earlier than transition times measured in the simulations.

$2^{-\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}\cdot n^5$ copies of $C_5$. To this end, he
devised a new variant of Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma. We obtain the
following results:
  - We first give a regularity-free proof of Csaba's theorem, which improves
the number of copies of $C_5$ to the optimal number

extragalactic high-precision RM values across 5720 deg$^{2}$ of sky
(corresponding to a polarized source areal number density of $\sim$0.43

synthesis from the Stokes $Q$ and $U$ channel images at an angular resolution
of 20'' across a frequency range of 120 to 168 MHz with a channel bandwidth of
97.6 kHz. The fraction of total intensity sources ($>1$ mJy beam$^{-1}$) found
to be polarized was $\sim$0.2%. The median detection threshold was 0.6 mJy
beam$^{-1}$ ($8\sigma_{QU}$), with a median RM uncertainty of 0.06 rad m$^{-2}$
(although a systematic uncertainty of up to 0.3 rad m$^{-2}$ is possible, after
the ionosphere RM correction). The median degree of polarization of the
detected sources is 1.8%, with a range of 0.05% to 31%. Comparisons with
cm-wavelength RMs indicate minimal amounts of Faraday complexity in the LoTSS
detections, making them ideal sources for RM Grid studies. Host galaxy
identifications were obtained for 88% of the sources, along with redshifts for
79% (both photometric and spectroscopic), with the median redshift being 0.6.

considering a model which does not suffer from strong coupling or large

inflation by coupling the gauge-invariants $F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$ and
$F_{\mu\nu}{\tilde{F}}^{\mu\nu}$ to a time-dependent function $I$ with a sharp
transition during inflation. The magnetic power spectrum is scale-invariant up
to the transition and very blue-shifted after that. The subsequent evolution of
the helical magnetic field is subjected to magneto-hydrodynamical processes,
resulting in far larger coherence lengths than those occurring after adiabatic
decay. Scale-invariant quadratic gravity is a suitable framework to test the
model, providing a natural physical interpretation. We show that fully helical
magnetic fields are generated with values in agreement with the lower bounds on
fields in the Intergalactic Medium derived from blazar observations. This model
holds even at large/intermediate energy scales of inflation, contrary to what
has been found in previous works.

analyzing whole slide images (WSIs) for disease classification problems.
However, with regard to gigapixel WSI classification problems, current MIL
models are often incapable of differentiating a WSI with extremely small tumor
lesions. This minute tumor-to-normal area ratio in a MIL bag inhibits the
attention mechanism from properly weighting the areas corresponding to minor
tumor lesions. To overcome this challenge, we propose salient instance
inference MIL (SiiMIL), a weakly-supervised MIL model for WSI classification.
Our method initially learns representations of normal WSIs, and it then
compares the normal WSIs representations with all the input patches to infer
the salient instances of the input WSI. Finally, it employs attention-based MIL
to perform the slide-level classification based on the selected patches of the
WSI. Our experiments imply that SiiMIL can accurately identify tumor instances,
which could only take up less than 1% of a WSI, so that the ratio of tumor to
normal instances within a bag can increase by two to four times. It is worth
mentioning that it performs equally well for large tumor lesions. As a result,
SiiMIL achieves a significant improvement in performance over the
state-of-the-art MIL methods.

the union of interiors of all geodesics going to a fixed point tends to form a
tree-like structure which is supported on a vanishing fraction of the space.
Such geodesic trees exhibit intricate fractal behaviour; for instance, while
almost every point in the space has only one geodesic going to the fixed point,
there exists an atypical set of points which admit multiple such geodesics. In
this paper, we consider the directed landscape, the recently constructed
scaling limit of exponential last passage percolation (LPP), with the aim of
developing tools to analyse the fractal aspects of the tree of semi-infinite
geodesics in a given direction. We use the duality (Pimentel '16) between the
geodesic tree and the interleaving competition interfaces in exponential LPP to
obtain a duality between the geodesic tree and the corresponding dual tree in
the landscape. Using this, we show that problems concerning the fractal
behaviour of sets of atypical points for the geodesic tree can be transformed
into corresponding problems for the dual tree, which might turn out to be
easier. In particular, we use this method to show that the set of points having
multiple semi-infinite geodesics in a fixed direction a.s. has Hausdorff

extend the analysis and explore the effects that different fractions (0$\%$,
10$\%$, and 20$\%$) of primordial binaries and stellar-mass black holes (BHs)
induce on the dynamical history of the system. As expected, the gradual
contraction of the cluster becomes milder and core collapse shallower for
increasing binary fraction. Nevertheless, the cluster dynamical evolution is
still properly traced by the three parameters. For models with a larger initial
retention of stellar mass BHs the evolution depends on the timescale of their
subsequent dynamical ejection. An early dynamical ejection of BHs results in a
long-term evolution of the three parameters similar to that found in systems
with no initial BH retention. Conversely, in the model that retains a large
number of BHs for extended time (slow dynamical ejection of BHs), the system is
characterized by a less concentrated structure and by the lack of significant
temporal evolution of the three parameters. The smaller values of the three

that these automata break ergodicity, i.e. they exhibit quantum scarring. We

without stellar feedback, magnetic fields, and driven turbulence, to study the
compression and expansion rates of the gas as functions of density. We show
that, around the mean density, supersonic turbulence promotes rough equilibrium
between the amounts of compressing and expanding gas, consistent with
continuous gas cycling between high and low density states. We find that the
inclusion of protostellar jets produces rapidly expanding and compressing
low-density gas. We find that the gas mass flux peaks at the transition between
the lognormal and power-law forms of the density probability distribution
function (PDF). This is consistent with the transition density tracking the
post-shock density, which promotes an enhancement of mass at this density
(i.e., shock compression and filament formation). At high densities, the gas
dynamics are dominated by self-gravity: the compression rate in all of our runs
matches the rate of the run with only gravity, suggesting that processes other
than self-gravity have little effect at these densities. The net gas mass flux
becomes constant at a density below the sink formation threshold, where it
equals the star formation rate. The density at which the net gas mass flux
equals the star formation rate is one order of magnitude lower than our sink
threshold density, corresponds to the formation of the second power-law tail in
the density PDF, and sets the overall star formation rates of these
simulations.

CANDELS mosaics and achieved an absolute alignment within $0.02\pm0.02$ arcsec
on average, which is a factor of several superior to existing mosaics. These
mosaics are available to download. We investigated the systematic effects that
need to be corrected for weak-lensing measurements. We find the largest
contributing systematic effect is caused by undersampling. Using stars as a
probe of the point-spread function (PSF), we find a sub-pixel centroid
dependence on the PSF shape that induces a change in the PSF ellipticity and
size by up to 0.02 and $3\%$, respectively. We find that the brighter-fatter
effect causes a $2\%$ increase in the size of the PSF and discover a
brighter-rounder effect that changes the ellipticity by 0.006. Based on the
narrow bandpasses of the WFC3-IR filters and the small range of slopes in a
galaxy's spectral energy distribution (SED) within the bandpasses, we suggest
that the impact of galaxy SED on PSF is minor in the NIR. Finally, we modeled
the PSF of WFC3-IR F160W for weak lensing using a principal component analysis.
The PSF models account for temporal and spatial variations of the PSF. The PSF
corrections result in residual ellipticities and sizes, $|de_1| <
0.0005\pm0.0003$, $|de_2| < 0.0005\pm0.0003$, and $|dR| < 0.0005\pm0.0001$,

investigate the orbital architecture of 14 close-in planets ranging from
mini-Neptune to Jupiter-size and covering a broad range of orbital distances.
While no signal is detected for the two smallest planets, we were able to
constrain the sky-projected spin--orbit angle of six planets for the first

stellar inclination, to derive the 3D orbital architecture in seven systems.
These results reveal a striking three-quarters of polar orbits in our sample,
all being systems with a single close-in planet but of various stellar and
planetary types. High-eccentricity migration is favored to explain such orbits
for several evaporating warm Neptunes, supporting the role of late migration in
shaping the desert and populating its rim. Putting our measurements in the
wider context of the close-in planet population will be useful to investigate
the various processes shaping their architectures.

delays between multiple SN images as a way to measure cosmological distances

SN sizes via microlensing, and measure properties of dust in galaxies. The
current challenge in the field is the rarity and difficulty in finding lensed

computational problems. In the quantum setting, it is also natural to consider
a different notion of complexity, namely the complexity of physically preparing
a certain quantum state. We study the relation between two such state
complexity classes: statePSPACE, which contains states that can be generated by
space-uniform polynomial-space quantum circuits, and stateQIP, which contains
states that a polynomial-time quantum verifier can generate by interacting with
an all-powerful untrusted quantum prover. The latter class was recently
introduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), who proved that statePSPACE
$\subseteq$ stateQIP.
  Our main result is the reverse inclusion, stateQIP $\subseteq$ statePSPACE,
thereby establishing equality of the two classes and providing a natural
state-complexity analogue to the celebrated QIP = PSPACE theorem of Jain, et
al. (J. ACM 2011). To prove this, we develop a polynomial-space quantum
algorithm for solving a large class of exponentially large ""PSPACE-computable""
semidefinite programs (SDPs), which also prepares an optimiser encoded in a
quantum state. Our SDP solver relies on recent block-encoding techniques from
quantum algorithms, demonstrating that these techniques are also useful for
complexity theory.
  Using similar techniques, we also show that optimal prover strategies for
general quantum interactive protocols can be implemented in quantum polynomial

Measurements of the occultation of an exoplanet at visible
wavelengths allow us to determine the reflective properties of a planetary
atmosphere. The observed occultation depth can be translated into a geometric
albedo. This in turn aids in characterising the structure and composition of an
atmosphere by providing additional information on the wavelength-dependent
reflective qualities of the aerosols in the atmosphere.
  Aims. Our aim is to provide a precise measurement of the geometric albedo of
the gas giant HD 189733b by measuring the occultation depth in the broad
optical bandpass of CHEOPS (350 - 1100 nm).
  Methods. We analysed 13 observations of the occultation of HD 189733b
performed by CHEOPS utilising the Python package PyCHEOPS. The resulting
occultation depth is then used to infer the geometric albedo accounting for the
contribution of thermal emission from the planet. We also aid the analysis by
refining the transit parameters combining observations made by the TESS and
CHEOPS space telescopes.
  Results. We report the detection of an $24.7 \pm 4.5$ ppm occultation in the
CHEOPS observations. This occultation depth corresponds to a geometric albedo
of $0.076 \pm 0.016$. Our measurement is consistent with models assuming the
atmosphere of the planet to be cloud-free at the scattering level and
absorption in the CHEOPS band to be dominated by the resonant Na doublet.
Taking into account previous optical-light occultation observations obtained
with the Hubble Space Telescope, both measurements combined are consistent with
a super-stellar Na elemental abundance in the dayside atmosphere of HD 189733b.
We further constrain the planetary Bond albedo to between 0.013 and 0.42 at
3$\sigma$ confidence.

have a significant effect on this trend, but the positions of the sightlines
with respect to the galaxy centres play an important role: the difference
between the two metallicities decreases when moving towards the galaxy centres,
and saturates to a minimum value in the central regions of galaxies,
irrespective of redshift and stellar mass. This implies that the mixing of the
two gas phases is most efficient in the central regions of galaxies where
sightlines generally have high column densities of HI. However, a high HI
column density alone doesn't guarantee a small difference between the two
metallicities. In galaxy outskirts, the inefficiency of the mixing of
star-forming gas with HI seems to dominate over the dilution of heavy elements
in HI through mixing with the pristine gas. We find good agreement between the
available observational data and the Z_{SFR}-Z_{HI} relation predicted by the
EAGLE simulations. Though, observed regions with a nuclear-starburst mode of
star formation appear not to follow the same relation.

quantum effects become important for its thermodynamic properties when its
temperature is below a mass gap scale. Using AdS$_2$/CFT$_1$ correspondence and
solutions for the corresponding Schwarzian action, we calculate the black hole
greybody factors including the quantum effects. In the low temperature limit,
the greybody factors scale as $T^{2s + 3/2}$ with $s$ the radiated field spin.
Hence, the Hawking radiation of a near-extremal charged black hole (NEBH) is
dominated by emitting scalar particles including the Higgs boson. Time
evolution of an NEBH is also calculated and shows a stochastic feature. For an
NEBH lighter than around $10^8$ times the Planck mass, its temperature at the

field-induced anomalous hysteresis observed only in temperature/magnetic

(anomalous thermomagnetic hysteresis) strongly depends on the driving thermal

dipolar interaction induced Ising paramagnetic to spin ice crossover develops a
liquid-gas transition type hysteresis below 4 K. Unlike field-induced
hysteresis, it shows weak dependency on thermal and non-thermal variables. Due
to the non-colinear spin structure, the applied dc bias magnetic field produces
quench disorder sites in the cooperative Ising spin matrix and suppresses the
spin-phonon coupling. These quench disorders create dynamic spin correlations
governed by quantum fluctuations, having slow spin relaxation and quick decay
times, which additionally contribute to ac susceptibility. The initial
conditions and measurement protocol decide the magnitude and sign of this
dynamical term contributing to ac susceptibility. It has been suggested that
such kind of out-of-equilibrium properties emerge by the cumulative effect of
geometric frustration, disorder, quantum fluctuations, and the cooperative

our understanding of exotic systems throughout cosmic time. These EIGs exhibit
spectral features requiring >54.42 eV photons: the energy needed to fully
ionize helium into He2+ and emit He II recombination lines. They are likely key
contributors to reionization, and they can also probe exotic stellar
populations or accretion onto massive black holes. To facilitate the use of
EIGs as probes of high ionization, we focus on ratios constructed from strong
rest-frame UV/optical emission lines, specifically [O III] 5008, H-beta, [Ne

= Ne53 and [Ne III]/[O II]), which are closely separated in wavelength, and
mitigates effects of dust attenuation and uncertainties in flux calibration. We
make predictions from photoionization models constructed from Cloudy that use a
broad range of stellar populations and black hole accretion models to explore
the sensitivity of these line ratios to changes in the ionizing spectrum. We
compare our models to observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and James

surface of a 3D topological insulator) coupled to an array of localized spins.
The spins are coupled ferromagnetically to each other, forming an ordered
ground state with low-energy spin-wave excitations (magnons). The Dirac
electrons couple to the spins through a spin-dependent effective Zeeman field.
The out-of-plane effective Zeeman field therefore serves as a Dirac mass that
gaps the electronic spectrum. Once a spin is flipped, it creates a surrounding
domain in which the sign of the Dirac mass is opposite to that of the rest of
the sample. Therefore, an electronic bound state appears on the domain wall, as
predicted by Jackiw and Rebbi. However, in a quantum magnet, a localized spin
flip does not produce an eigenstate. Instead, the eigenstates correspond to
delocalized spin waves (magnons). As in the case of the single flipped spin,
the delocalized magnon also binds an in-gap electronic state. We name this
excitation a `Jackiw-Rebbi-Magnon' (JRM) and study its signature in the dynamic
spin susceptibility. When the sample is tunnel-coupled to an electronic
reservoir, a magnon produced in a system without any electrons hybridizes with
a JRM (which binds a single electron), producing magnon-JRM polaritons. For
such a system, we identify a quantum phase transition when the magnon-JRM
polariton energy falls below that of the fully polarized ferromagnetic ground
state.

""what would have happened if...?"" For example, ""would the person have had
surgery if he or she had been Black?"" To address this kind of questions,
calculating an average treatment effect (ATE) is often uninformative, because
one would like to know how much impact a variable (such as skin color) has on a
specific individual, characterized by certain covariates. Trying to calculate a
conditional ATE (CATE) seems more appropriate. In causal inference, the
propensity score approach assumes that the treatment is influenced by x, a
collection of covariates. Here, we will have the dual view: doing an
intervention, or changing the treatment (even just hypothetically, in a thought
experiment, for example by asking what would have happened if a person had been
Black) can have an impact on the values of x. We will see here that optimal
transport allows us to change certain characteristics that are influenced by
the variable we are trying to quantify the effect of. We propose here a mutatis
mutandis version of the CATE, which will be done simply in dimension one by
saying that the CATE must be computed relative to a level of probability,
associated to the proportion of x (a single covariate) in the control
population, and by looking for the equivalent quantile in the test population.
In higher dimension, it will be necessary to go through transport, and an
application will be proposed on the impact of some variables on the probability
of having an unnatural birth (the fact that the mother smokes, or that the

the spectroscopic parameters of C10H-. From the velocity stacked data and the
matched filter response, C10H- is detected at >9{\sigma} confidence level at a
column density of 4.04e11 cm-2. A dedicated search for the C10H radical was
also conducted towards TMC-1. In this case, the stacked molecular emission of
C10H was detected at a ~3.2{\sigma} confidence interval at a column density of
2.02e11 cm-2. However, since the determined confidence level is currently
<5{\sigma}, we consider the identification of C10H as tentative. The full
GOTHAM dataset was also used to better characterize the physical parameters
including column density, excitation temperature, linewidth, and source size
for the C4H, C6H and C8H radicals and their respective anions, and the measured
column densities were compared to the predictions from a gas/grain chemical
formation model and from a machine learning analysis. Given the measured
values, the C10H-/C10H column density ratio is ~2.0 - the highest value
measured between an anion and neutral species to date. Such a high ratio is at
odds with current theories for interstellar anion chemistry. For the radical
species, both models can reproduce the measured abundances found from the

abundances much better than the gas/grain chemical model, suggesting that the

activated events in which the system changes its state by surmounting an

often employed in the stochastic modeling of activated processes. In this
contribution, we explore the alternative of employing parameterized forms of
the equilibrium distribution by means of the symmetric linear combination of
two gaussian functions. Such a procedure leads to flexible and convenient
models for the landscape and the energy barrier whose features are controlled
by the second moments of the gaussian functions. The rate constants are
examined through the solution of the corresponding diffusion problem, that is
the Fokker-Planck-Smoluchowski equation specified according to the
parameterized equilibrium distribution. The numerical calculations clearly show
that the asymptotic limit of large barriers does not agree with the results of
the Kramers theory. The underlying reason is that the linear scaling of the
potential, the procedure justifying the Kramers theory, cannot be applied when
dealing with parameterized forms of the equilibrium distribution. A different
kind of asymptotic analysis is then required and we introduce the appropriate
theory when the equilibrium distribution is represented as a symmetric linear
combination of two gaussian functions, first in the one-dimensional case and

parameter space into a weak and a strong selection regimes. We find that
genetic diversity is highly non-monotone in the selection strength and, in
contrast with the common intuition, our model predicts that genetic diversity
is typically higher in the strong selection regime. This apparent paradox is
resolved by observing that a higher selection strength increases the absolute
fitness of the wave, but typically generate lower relative fitness between
individuals within the wave. These findings entail that inferring the magnitude
of natural selection from genetic data may raise some serious conceptual
issues.
  Along the way, we uncover a new phase transition in front propagation.
Namely, we show that the transition from weak to strong selection can be

the economic implication of CDRT if not effectively managed. Hence, a novel
deep reinforcement learning agent (DRL), integrated with an automated
hyperparameter selection feature, is proposed in this study for the real-time
scheduling of a multi-energy system coupled with CDRT. Post-carbon capture
systems (PCCS) and direct-air capture systems (DACS) are considered CDRT.
Various possible configurations are evaluated using real-time multi-energy data
of a district in Arizona and CDRT parameters from manufacturers' catalogues and
pilot project documentation. The simulation results validate that an optimised
soft-actor critic (SAC) algorithm outperformed the TD3 algorithm due to its
maximum entropy feature. We then trained four (4) SAC agents, equivalent to the
number of considered case studies, using optimised hyperparameter values and
deployed them in real time for evaluation. The results show that the proposed
DRL agent can meet the prosumers' multi-energy demand and schedule the CDRT
energy demand economically without specified constraints violation. Also, the
proposed DRL agent outperformed rule-based scheduling by 23.65%. However, the
configuration with PCCS and solid-sorbent DACS is considered the most suitable
configuration with a high CO2 captured-released ratio of 38.54, low CO2
released indicator value of 2.53, and a 36.5% reduction in CDR cost due to
waste heat utilisation and high absorption capacity of the selected sorbent.
However, the adoption of CDRT is not economically viable at the current carbon
price. Finally, we showed that CDRT would be attractive at a carbon price of
400-450USD/ton with the provision of tax incentives by the policymakers.

significant detections, direct measurements of single objects remain scarce.
The lack of such a sample currently prevents a robust analysis of the cosmic
baryon content composed of the hot WHIM, which could help solve the
cosmological missing baryons problem. To improve the search for the missing
baryons, we used the EAGLE simulation. Our aim is to understand the metal
enrichment and distribution of highly ionised metals in the Cosmic Web. We
detected the filaments by applying the Bisous formalism to the simulated
galaxies, and characterised the spatial distributions as well as mass and
volume fractions of the filamentary oxygen and OVII. We then constructed OVII
column density maps and determined their detectability with Athena X-IFU.
However, the oxygen and OVII number densities drop fast beyond the virial radii
of haloes, falling below detectable levels at 700 kpc. Thus, only ~1% of the
filament volumes are filled with OVII at detectable densities. This
non-homogeneous distribution of the OVII complicates its usage for tracing the
missing baryons. Instead, OVII forms narrow envelopes around haloes. This
localised nature results in a low chance (10-20% per sight line) of detecting
intergalactic OVII with Athena X-IFU within the SDSS catalogue of filaments.
With future filament samples from the 4MOST survey, the chances increase up to
a level of ~50%. Nonetheless, based on EAGLE results, this would not be enough
to conclusively solve the missing baryon problem, as it would be limited to a
few times the virial radii of haloes. Fortunately, the volumes around haloes
are dense in hot WHIM, and tracing it could reduce the content of baryons still
missing by ~25%.

results on nucleon resonance ($N^\ast$) electroexcitation amplitudes (i.e.
$\gamma_vpN^\ast$ electrocouplings) in the mass range up to 1.8\,GeV for
virtual photon four-momentum squared (i.e. photon virtualities $Q^2$) up to
7.5\,GeV$^2$ available from exclusive meson electroproduction data acquired
during the 6-GeV era of experiments at Jefferson Laboratory (JLab). These
results, combined with achievements in the use of continuum Schwinger function
methods (CSMs), offer new opportunities for charting the momentum dependence of
the dressed quark mass from results on the $Q^2$-evolution of the
$\gamma_vpN^\ast$ electrocouplings. A successful description of the
$\Delta(1232)3/2^+$ and $N(1440)1/2^+$ electrocouplings has been achieved using
CSMs with, in both cases, common momentum-dependent mass functions for the
dressed quarks, for the gluons, and the same momentum-dependent strong
coupling. Parameter-free CSM predictions for the electrocouplings of the
$\Delta(1600)3/2^+$ became available in 2019. The experimental results obtained
in the first half of 2022 have confirmed the CSM predictions. We also discuss
prospects for these studies during the 12-GeV era at JLab using the CLAS12
detector, with experiments that are currently in progress, and canvass the
physics motivation for continued studies in this area with a possible increase
of the JLab electron beam energy up to 22\,GeV.

However, little has hitherto been understood about the role of symmetry in
quantum entanglement. Here, we establish the comprehensive classification of
typical quantum entanglement for free fermions, or equivalently the quadratic
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with symmetry, on the basis of the tenfold fundamental
symmetry classes of time reversal, charge conjugation, and chiral
transformation. Through both analytical and numerical calculations of random
matrix theory, we show that the volume-law contribution to average entanglement
entropy is robust and remains unaffected by symmetry. Conversely, we uncover
that the constant terms of the average and variance of entanglement entropy
yield tenfold universal values unique to each symmetry class. These constant
terms originate from the combination of a global scaling of the entanglement
spectrum due to time-reversal symmetry and a singular peak at the center of the
entanglement spectrum due to chiral or particle-hole symmetry. Our work
elucidates the interplay of symmetry and entanglement in quantum physics and
provides characterization of symmetry-enriched quantum chaos.

the correctness of programs with executions beyond the given bound. By

Generalized Policy Improvement (GPI) to define principled, formally-derived

that holds great promise for improving human health. Full-waveform inversion
(FWI)-based image reconstruction methods account for the relevant wave physics
to produce high spatial resolution images of the acoustic properties of the
breast tissues. A practical USCT design employs a circular ring-array comprised
of elevation-focused ultrasonic transducers, and volumentric imaging is
achieved by translating the ring-array orthogonally to the imaging plane. In
commonly deployed slice-by-slice (SBS) reconstruction approaches, the
three-dimensional (3D) volume is reconstructed by stacking together
two-dimensional (2D) images reconstructed for each position of the ring-array.
A limitation of the SBS reconstruction approach is that it does not account for
3D wave propagation physics and the focusing properties of the transducers,
which can result in significant image artifacts and inaccuracies. To perform 3D
image reconstruction when elevation-focused transducers are employed, a
numerical description of the focusing properties of the transducers should be
included in the forward model. To address this, a 3D computational model of an
elevation-focused transducer is developed to enable 3D FWI-based reconstruction
methods to be deployed in ring-array-based USCT. The focusing is achieved by
applying a spatially varying temporal delay to the ultrasound pulse (emitter
mode) and recorded signal (receiver mode). The proposed numerical transducer
model is quantitatively validated and employed in computer-simulation studies

amount of resource consumption is determined so as to maximize a profit-loss

consumption while taking individuals' behavioral disparity into account. Unlike
rational decision makers who consume the amount of resource to maximize the
expected utility function, human decision makers act to maximize their
subjective utilities. We employ prospect theory to model humans' loss aversion
towards a risky event. The amount of resource consumption that maximizes the
humans' subjective utility is derived to characterize the actual behavior of
humans. It is shown that loss attitudes may lead the human to behave quite

important aspect of financial transaction networks is temporality. The order

the graph structure. Temporal motifs, defined as a set of nodes that interact
with each other in a short time period, are a promising tool in this context.
In this work, we study three unique temporal financial networks: transactions
in Mercari, an online marketplace, payments in a synthetic network generated by
J.P. Morgan Chase, and payments and friendships among Venmo users. We consider
the fraud detection problem on the Mercari and J.P. Morgan Chase networks, for
which the ground truth is available. We show that temporal motifs offer
superior performance than a previous method that considers simple graph
features. For the Venmo network, we investigate the interplay between financial

identification, and analysis of temporal cycles. For friendship prediction,
temporal motifs yield better results than general heuristics, such as Jaccard
and Adamic-Adar measures. We are also able to identify vendors with high
accuracy and observe interesting patterns in rare motifs, like temporal cycles.
We believe that the analysis, datasets, and lessons from this work will be
beneficial for future research on financial transaction networks.

a function of disk viscosity, and are found to be in agreement with previous
studies. At very low disk viscosities (e.g. $\alpha = 10^{-5}$), anticyclonic
vortices are observed along the inner edge of the disk. These vortices can
persist for thousands of binary orbits, creating azimuthally localized

state-of-the-art systems lack robustness to ""real world"" events, where the
input distributions and tasks encountered by the deployed systems will not be
limited to the original training context, and systems will instead need to
adapt to novel distributions and tasks while deployed. This critical gap may be
addressed through the development of ""Lifelong Learning"" systems that are
capable of 1) Continuous Learning, 2) Transfer and Adaptation, and 3)
Scalability. Unfortunately, efforts to improve these capabilities are typically
treated as distinct areas of research that are assessed independently, without
regard to the impact of each separate capability on other aspects of the
system. We instead propose a holistic approach, using a suite of metrics and an
evaluation framework to assess Lifelong Learning in a principled way that is
agnostic to specific domains or system techniques. Through five case studies,
we show that this suite of metrics can inform the development of varied and
complex Lifelong Learning systems. We highlight how the proposed suite of
metrics quantifies performance trade-offs present during Lifelong Learning
system development - both the widely discussed Stability-Plasticity dilemma and
the newly proposed relationship between Sample Efficient and Robust Learning.
Further, we make recommendations for the formulation and use of metrics to
guide the continuing development of Lifelong Learning systems and assess their
progress in the future.

devices for quantum information has highlighted the need to mitigate sources of
qubit decoherence, driving a renewed interest in understanding the underlying
noise mechanism(s). Though a consensus has emerged attributing flux noise to
surface spins, their identity and interaction mechanisms remain unclear,
prompting further study. Here we apply weak in-plane magnetic fields to a
capacitively-shunted flux qubit (where the Zeeman splitting of surface spins
lies below the device temperature) and study the flux-noise-limited qubit
dephasing, revealing previously unexplored trends that may shed light on the
dynamics behind the emergent $1/f$ noise. Notably, we observe an enhancement
(suppression) of the spin-echo (Ramsey) pure dephasing time in fields up to
$B=100~\text{G}$. With direct noise spectroscopy, we further observe a
transition from a $1/f$ to approximately Lorentzian frequency dependence below
10 Hz and a reduction of the noise above 1 MHz with increasing magnetic field.
We suggest that these trends are qualitatively consistent with an increase of
spin cluster sizes with magnetic field. These results should help to inform a
complete microscopic theory of $1/f$ flux noise in superconducting circuits.

automatic differentiation (FAD) framework that 1) enables computing derivatives
of functions involving client and server computation as well as communication
between them and 2) operates in a manner compatible with existing federated
technology. In other words, FAD computes derivatives across communication
boundaries. We show, in analogy with traditional AD, that FAD may be
implemented using various accumulation modes, which introduce distinct
computation-communication trade-offs and systems requirements. Further, we show
that a broad class of federated computations is closed under these various
modes of FAD, implying in particular that if the original computation can be
implemented using privacy-preserving primitives, its derivative may be computed
using only these same primitives. We then show how FAD can be used to create
algorithms that dynamically learn components of the algorithm itself. In
particular, we show that FedAvg-style algorithms can exhibit significantly
improved performance by using FAD to adjust the server optimization step
automatically, or by using FAD to learn weighting schemes for computing
weighted averages across clients.

is also unclear how relics relate to radio halos, which trace merger-induced
turbulence in the intracluster medium. Aims. We aim to perform the first
statistical analysis of radio relics in a mass-selected sample of galaxy
clusters, using homogeneous observations. Methods. We analysed all relics
observed by the Low Frequency Array Two Metre Sky Survey Data Release 2 (LoTSS
DR2) at 144 MHz, hosted by galaxy clusters in the second Planck catalogue of SZ
sources (PSZ2). We measured and compared the relic properties in a uniform,
unbiased way. In particular, we developed a method to describe the
characteristic downstream width in a statistical manner. Additionally, we
searched for differences between radio relic-hosting clusters with and without
radio halos. Results. We find that, in our sample, $\sim$ 10% of galaxy
clusters host at least one radio relic. We confirm previous findings, at higher
frequencies, of a correlation between the relic-cluster centre distance and the
longest linear size, as well as the radio relic power and cluster mass.
However, our findings suggest that we are still missing a population of
low-power relics. We also find that relics are wider than theoretically
expected, even with optimistic downstream conditions. Finally, we do not find
evidence of a single property that separates relic-hosting clusters with and
without radio halos.

relying on (potentially imprecise) derivative information, it is particularly
well suited to controlling a system based on an imperfect deep neural network

operation of distributed multi-agent systems (MAS). Existing fault-tolerant
control strategies generally assume the sensor faults to be bounded and
uncorrelated. In this paper, we study the ramifications of allowing the sensor
attack injections to be unbounded and correlated. These malicious sensor
attacks may bypass the conventional attack-detection methods and compromise the
cooperative performance and even stability of the distributed networked MAS.
Moreover, the attackers may gain access to the actuation computing channels and
manipulate the control input commands. To this end, we consider the resilient
containment control problem of general linear heterogeneous MAS in the face of
correlated and unbounded sensor attacks, as well as general unbounded actuator
attacks. We propose an attack-resilient control framework to guarantee the
uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamical systems and preserve
the bounded containment performance. Compared with existing literature
addressing bounded faults and/or disturbances that are unintentionally caused
in the sensor and actuator channels, the proposed control protocols are
resilient against unknown unbounded attack signals simultaneously injected into

show that nonlinear dynamics in low-finesse resonators, namely the formation of

measurements of CO2, we show an equivalent path length enhancement of nearly

high concentrations of CO2 with sensitivities that are orders of magnitude
higher than those achievable through linear cavity-enhanced sensing, thereby

High-sensitivity detection of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) was developed based
on this principle. Under irradiation from monochromatic light with a wavelength
much larger than the size of a given MNP, Rayleigh scattering occurs on the MNP
surface. The MNPs anisotropic and orientate themselves into chains, meaning
that the Rayleigh scattering now decreases under magnetic field excitation.
After applying an AC magnetic field of frequency f, the transmitted light
passing through the MNPs reagent generates an AC signal with a frequency of 2f.
Moreover, the 2f signal disappears after removal of the magnetic field. This
creates a ""magneto-optical gate"" effect. The instantaneous and highly sensitive
detection of magneto-optical markers with a concentration of 0.2 {\mu}g/mL and
an effective optical path length of 10 {\mu}m is realized based on this

of radiative precession. HAC also has slow Larmor precession compared to the
randomization by gas collisions and cannot be aligned with the magnetic field

can be weakly aligned along the induced electric field ($E$-RAT) at high$-J$

Deployed RMAB systems typically operate in two stages: the first predicts the
unknown parameters defining the RMAB instance, and the second employs an
optimization algorithm to solve the constructed RMAB instance.
  In this work we provide and analyze the results from a first-of-its-kind
deployment of an RMAB system in public health domain, aimed at improving
maternal and child health. Our analysis is focused towards understanding the
relationship between prediction accuracy and overall performance of deployed
RMAB systems. This is crucial for determining the value of investing in
improving predictive accuracy towards improving the final system performance,
and is useful for diagnosing, monitoring deployed RMAB systems.
  Using real-world data from our deployed RMAB system, we demonstrate that an
improvement in overall prediction accuracy may even be accompanied by a
degradation in the performance of RMAB system -- a broad investment of
resources to improve overall prediction accuracy may not yield expected

two state of the art approaches: masked auto-encoders, MAE and contrastive
language image pre-training, CLIP provides a benefit over CLIP when trained on
a corpus of 11.3M image-text pairs, but little to no benefit (as evaluated on a

answering key questions including the coronal heating problem. Multiple studies
have suggested small-scale magnetic reconnection events may play a crucial
role. These reconnection events are expected to involve acceleration of
electrons to suprathermal energies, which can then produce nonthermal
observational signatures. However, due to the paucity of sensitive
high-fidelity observations capable of probing these nonthermal signatures, most
studies were unable to quantify their nonthermal nature. Here we use joint
radio observations from the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Expanded Owens
Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) to detect transient emissions from the quiet solar
corona in the microwave (GHz) domain. While similar transients have been
reported in the past, their nonthermal nature could not be adequately
quantified due to the unavailability of broadband observations. Using a much
larger bandwidth available now with the VLA and EOVSA, in this study, we are
able to quantify the nonthermal energy associated with two of these transients.
We find that the total nonthermal energy associated with some of these
transients can be comparable to or even larger than the total thermal energy of
a nanoflare, which underpins the importance of nonthermal energy in the total
coronal energy budget.

other vehicles and will reselect for the next SPS period. Besides that, other
protocols follow the SPS. Although it sacrifices 14.29% of resources by
including Ledger, it can eventually reduce the collision probability. In this
paper, a Monte Carlo simulator is used to verify and analyze the performance of
the Ledger system. Numerical results show that abide by the SPS protocol, the
Ledger system can make the collision probability converge to zero after amount

whose communication links may appear or disappear unpredictably over time.
Previous research has shown that deterministically computing an arbitrary

linear number of communication rounds (Di Luna-Viglietta, FOCS 2022).
  However, fast algorithms for anonymous dynamic networks rely on the
construction and transmission of large data structures called ""history trees"",
whose size is polynomial in the number of processes. This approach is
unfeasible if the network is congested, and only messages of logarithmic size
can be sent through its links. Observe that sending a large message piece by

the processes combined with the dynamic nature of the network. Moreover, it is
known that certain basic tasks such as all-to-all token dissemination (by means
of single-token forwarding) require $\Omega(n^2/\log n)$ rounds in congested

BD+30$^\circ$549 which is bona-fide member of young NGC 1333 star forming
region. We found that the star possesses negligible rotation and helium-weak
spectroscopic pattern with strongly enhanced Si II and Si III lines. The
fundamental parameters of the star $T_{eff}$=13100~K and $\log
(L/L_{\odot})$=2.1 indicate its age of about 2.7 Myr and position on the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram at the end of the Pre-Main Sequence evolutionary
track, close to the Zero Age Main Sequence. Abundance analysis reveals the
modest deficit of almost all elements with exception of Si, Fe, Ca and P which
are overabundant. We performed the non-LTE calculations for Si II/Si III, Mg II
and Ca II in order to check the influence of departures from LTE on line
formation. Non-LTE calculations lead to much better reproduction of individual
silicon line profiles, but does not completely remove the abundance discrepancy
between Si II and Si III lines. We also investigate the effects of possible
chemical stratification in BD+30$^\circ$549. We suspect that the ""Si II/Si III
anomaly"", observed in BD+30$^\circ$549 spectrum arises under the combined
action of the vertical and horizontal abundance gradients and non-LTE effects.
We suppose that evolutionary status and phenomena observed in BD+30$^\circ$549
indicate that conditions favorable for the selective diffusion and formation of
the surface chemical composition peculiarities (slow rotation and stabilization
of the atmosphere) can be built up already at the Pre-Main Sequence phase.

Seeking to improve on these limitations, we apply a new paradigm denoted
Autonomous Material Composites to the design of avian-scale morphing wings.
With this methodology, we reduce the need for complex actuation and mechanisms,
and allow for three-dimensional placement of stretchable fiber optic strain
gauges (Optical Lace) throughout the metamaterial structure. This structure
centers around elastomeric conformal lattices, and by applying
functionally-graded warping and thickening to this lattice, we allow for local
tailoring of the compliance properties to fit the desired morphing. As a
result, the wing achieves high-deformation morphing in three DOF: twist,
camber, and extension/compression, with these morphed shapes effectively
modifying the aerodynamic performance of the wing, as demonstrated in
low-Reynolds wind tunnel testing. Our sensors also successfully demonstrate
differentiable trends across all degrees of morphing, enabling the future state
estimation and control of this wing.

higher resource utilization, greater sky survey area, and higher frequency of
full space-time monitoring than single telescopes. Compared with the ordinary
coordinated operation of several telescopes, the new astronomical observation
mode has an order of magnitude difference in the number of telescopes. It
requires efficient coordinated observation by large-domain telescopes
distributed at different sites. Coherent modeling of various abstract
environmental constraints is essential for responding to multiple complex
science goals. Also, due to competing science priorities and field visibility,
how the telescope arrays are scheduled for observations can significantly
affect observation efficiency. This paper proposes a multilevel scheduling
model oriented toward the problem of telescope-array scheduling for time-domain
surveys. A flexible framework is developed with basic functionality
encapsulated in software components implemented on hierarchical architectures.
An optimization metric is proposed to self-consistently weight contributions
from time-varying observation conditions to maintain uniform coverage and
efficient time utilization from a global perspective. The performance of the
scheduler is evaluated through simulated instances. The experimental results
show that our scheduling framework performs correctly and provides acceptable
solutions considering the percentage of time allocation efficiency and sky
coverage uniformity in a feasible amount of time. Using a generic version of
the telescope-array scheduling framework, we also demonstrate its scalability
and its potential to be applied to other astronomical applications.

bias field that is known to generate a single particle gap $2\Delta$ and a

The transition occurs when the exciton binding energy exceeds the band gap
$2\Delta$. We predict the critical bias (converted to band gap),
$\Delta_c\approx 60$ meV, below which the excitons condense. The critical
temperature, $T_c(\Delta)$, is maximum at $\Delta \approx 25$ meV,
$T_c^\text{max}\approx 115$ K, decreasing significantly at smaller $\Delta$ due
to thermal screening. Entering the condensate phase, the superfluid transition
is accompanied by a cusp in the electric polarization ${\cal P}(\Delta)$ at
$\Delta\to\Delta_c$, which provides a striking testable signature.
Additionally, we find that the condensate prefers to form a pair density wave.

substitute the Ga atom of monolayer GaN and form a buckling structure with a
magnetic moment of 1 $\mu_B$ per dopant. The N-rich growth conditions are more
desirable for such a substitution process than the Ga-rich grow conditions.
With a large diffusion barrier vertical to the monolayer GaN, both Ge and Sn
atoms tend to stay on the same side of monolayer GaN with an antiferromagnetic
coupling between them. When intrinsic vacancies exist in monolayer GaN, the
magnetic moments of group-IV dopants vanish due to the charge transferring from
the dopants to Ga or N vacancies. The precondition creation of Ga vacancies, a

this goal, we propose a new method dubbed Multimodal Video Adapter (MV-Adapter)

dynamic variations across frames. The second is a Cross-Modal Interaction

receding-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) controller. By developing a novel
perturbation result of the Riccati difference equation, a performance upper
bound is obtained and suggests that for many cases, the prediction horizon
should be either 1 or infinity to improve the control performance, depending on
the relative difference between the modeling error and the terminal value
function error. The obtained suboptimality performance bound is also applied to
provide end-to-end performance guarantees, e.g., regret bounds, for nominal
receding-horizon LQ controllers in a learning-based setting.

a total (gas and dust) mass of 0.031 Msun. We estimated a dynamical mass for
the central object of 0.66 Msun, and the mass of the molecular outflow of
5x10-5 Msun. The observations confirm that the outflow rotation has a similar
orientation to that of the edge-on disk. For the outflow, we find that the
following quantities: the rotation velocity, the specific angular momentum, and
the launching radius, decrease with the height above mid-plane, as observed in
other molecular rotating outflows. The radius, and expansion velocity also
increase with the height above the disk midplane. Estimations for the outflow
linear momentum rate, the outflow angular momentum rate, and the accretion
luminosity seem to be well explained by a disk wind present in CB26.

stars transform kinetic energy into heat via a process referred to as tidal
heating. In this paper we aim to explore the way tidal heating affects the
stellar structure. We used the TIDES code, which solves the equations of motion
of the three-dimensional (3D) grid of volume elements that conform multiple
layers of a rotating binary star to obtain an instantaneous value for the
angular velocity, $\omega''$, as a function of position in the presence of
gravitational, centrifugal, Coriolis, gas pressure, and viscous forces. The
released energy, $\dot{E,}$ was computed using a prescription for turbulent
viscosity that depends on the instantaneous velocity gradients. The $\dot{E}$
values for each radius were injected into a MESA stellar structure calculation.
The method is illustrated for a 1.0+0.8 M$_\odot$ binary system, with an
orbital period of $P$=1.44d and departures from synchronous rotation of 5% and
10%. We find that heated models have a larger radius and surface luminosity, a
smaller surface convection zone, and lower nuclear reaction rates than the
equivalent standard stellar models, and their evolutionary tracks extend to
higher temperatures. The magnitude of these effects depends on the amount of
injected energy, which, for a fixed set of stellar, rotation and orbital
parameters, depends on the perturbed star's density structure and turbulent
viscosity. Tidal heating offers a possible alternative for describing phenomena
such as bloated or overluminous binary components, age discrepancies, and
aspherical mass ejection, as well as the extended main sequence turnoff in
clusters. However, establishing its actual role requires 3D stellar structure
models commensurate with the nonspherically symmetric properties of tidal
perturbations.

clothing is a very high volume and high velocity category and thus deserves its
own attention. Given the scale it is challenging to monitor the completeness of
image set, which adequately details the product for the consumers, which in
turn often leads to a poor customer experience and thus customer drop off.
  To supervise the quality and completeness of the images in the product pages
for these product types and suggest improvements, we propose a Human Pose
Detection based unsupervised method to scan the image set of a product for the
missing ones. The unsupervised approach suggests a fair approach to sellers
based on product and category irrespective of any biases. We first create a
reference image set of popular products with wholesome imageset. Then we create
clusters of images to label most desirable poses to form the classes for the
reference set from these ideal products set. Further, for all test products we
scan the images for all desired pose classes w.r.t. reference set poses,
determine the missing ones and sort them in the order of potential impact.
These missing poses can further be used by the sellers to add enriched product
listing image. We gathered data from popular online webstore and surveyed ~200
products manually, a large fraction of which had at least 1 repeated image or
missing variant, and sampled 3K products(~20K images) of which a significant
proportion had scope for adding many image variants as compared to high rated
products which had more than double image variants, indicating that our model
can potentially be used on a large scale.

the magnetization varies in the plane perpendicular to the current. Using
density functional theory and Boltzmann transport equation calculations for bcc

four typical deformed nuclei. The density distributions of neutrons and protons
are consistently obtained from the Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov calculation,
and the angular distribution of the neutron skin can be varied by adjusting the

polar angular distributions of the neutron skin in $^{96}$Ru and $^{197}$Au by
comparing the yield ratios of free spectator neutrons to protons in their

Therefore it is essential to design scalable dataframe solutions. There have
been multiple attempts to tackle this problem, the most notable being the
dataframe systems developed using distributed computing environments such as
Dask and Ray. Even though Dask/Ray distributed computing features look very
promising, we perceive that the Dask Dataframes/Ray Datasets still have room
for optimization. In this paper, we present CylonFlow, an alternative
distributed dataframe execution methodology that enables state-of-the-art
performance and scalability on the same Dask/Ray infrastructure (thereby
supercharging them!). To achieve this, we integrate a high performance
dataframe system Cylon, which was originally based on an entirely different
execution paradigm, into Dask and Ray. Our experiments show that on a pipeline
of dataframe operators, CylonFlow achieves 30x more distributed performance
than Dask Dataframes. Interestingly, it also enables superior sequential
performance due to the native C++ execution of Cylon. We believe the success of
Cylon & CylonFlow extends beyond the data engineering domain, and can be used
to consolidate high performance computing and distributed computing ecosystems.

using physics-informed neural networks (PINN). PINN represents a recent advance
in deep learning, offering the possibility to enhance physics-based simulations
and inverse analyses. PINN-based deterministic seismic tomography uses two
separate neural networks (NNs) to predict seismic velocity and travel time.
Naive Bayesian NN (BNN) approaches are unable to handle the high-dimensional
spaces spanned by the weight parameters of these two NNs. Hence, we reformulate
the problem to perform the Bayesian estimation exclusively on the NN predicting
seismic velocity, while the NN predicting travel time is used only for
deterministic travel time calculations, with the help of the adjoint method.
Furthermore, we perform BNN by introducing a function-space Stein variational
gradient descent (SVGD), which performs particle-based variational inference in
the space of the function predicted by the NN (i.e., seismic velocity), instead
of in the traditional weight space. The result is a velocity-space SVGD for the
PINN-based seismic tomography model (vSVGD-PINN-ST) that decreases the
complexity of the problem thus enabling a more accurate and physically
consistent Bayesian estimation, as confirmed by synthetic tests in one- and
two-dimensional tomographic problem settings. The method allows PINN to be
applied to Bayesian seismic tomography practically for the first time. Not only
that, it can be a powerful tool not only for geophysical but also for general
PINN-based Bayesian estimation problems associated with compatible NNs

in the active research field of studies on the decoding of brain signals of
human speech. A brain-computer interface system can be implemented using
electroencephalogram signals because it poses more less clinical risk and can
be acquired using portable instruments. One of the most interesting tasks for
the brain-computer interface system is decoding words from the raw
electroencephalogram signals. Before a brain-computer interface may be used by
a new user, current electroencephalogram-based brain-computer interface
research typically necessitates a subject-specific adaption stage. In contrast,
the subject-independent situation is one that is highly desired since it allows
a well-trained model to be applied to new users with little or no
precalibration. The emphasis is on creating an efficient decoder that may be
employed adaptively in subject-independent circumstances in light of this
crucial characteristic. Our proposal is to explicitly apply skip connections
between convolutional layers to enable the flow of mutual information between
layers. To do this, we add skip connections between layers, allowing the mutual
information to flow throughout the layers. The output of the encoder is then
passed through the fully-connected layer to finally represent the probabilities
of the 13 classes. In this study, overt speech was used to record the
electroencephalogram data of 16 participants. The results show that when the
skip connection is present, the classification performance improves notably.

suffer from white Gaussian noise (WGN) and non-Gaussian impulsive noise (IN),
i.e., mixed Gaussian-impulsive noise (MGIN). Under MGIN channel, classical
communication signal schemes and corresponding detection methods usually can
not achieve desirable performance as they are optimized with respect to WGN.
Moreover, as the widely adopted IN model has no analytical and general
closed-form expression of probability density function (PDF), it is extremely
hard to obtain optimal communication signal and corresponding detection schemes
based on classical stochastic signal processing theory. To circumvent these
difficulties, we propose a data-driven end-to-end framework to address the
communication signal design and detection under MGIN channel in this paper. In
this proposed framework, a channel noise simulator (CNS) is elaborately
designed based on an improved generative adversarial net (GAN) to simulate the
MGIN without requirement of any analytical PDF. Meanwhile, a multi-level
wavelet convolutional neural network (MWCNN) based preprocessing network is
used to mitigate the negative effect of outliers due to the IN. Compared with
conventional approaches and existing end-to-end systems, extensive simulation
results verify that our proposed novel end-to-end communication system can
achieve better performance in terms of bit-error rate (BER) under MGIN

PG~1229+204, the inferred B-field direction is parallel to the local kpc-scale
jet direction. Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data on PG~0050+124 indicates
that the jet changes its direction from pc- to kpc-scales in this source. For

literature for global signatures of `AGN feedback' in this sample such as
reduced molecular gas content or star-formation, scenarios like localised AGN
feedback or a preliminary phase of AGN feedback, cannot be ruled out.
Differences in the time-scales of gas outflows and AGN activity could also play
a role. In addition, the galactic merger scenario could influence the overall
interpretation of AGN feedback in these sources, given that the host galaxies

suitable regularity on the admissible class of shear force $g(t),$ we prove
that these functionals are Fr\'echet differentiable, and the derivatives are
expressed through the solutions of corresponding adjoint problems posed with

solvability of these adjoint problems is obtained under the minimal regularity

decision through present input features. Such methods do not inform the user of
the sufficient conditions that alter these decisions when they are not
desirable. Contrastive explanations circumvent this problem by providing
explanations of the form ""If the feature $X>x$, the output $Y$ would be
different''. While different approaches are developed to find contrasts; these
methods do not all deal with mutability and attainability constraints.
  In this work, we present a novel approach to locally contrast the prediction
of any classifier. Our Contrastive Entropy-based explanation method, CEnt,
approximates a model locally by a decision tree to compute entropy information
of different feature splits. A graph, G, is then built where contrast nodes are
found through a one-to-many shortest path search. Contrastive examples are
generated from the shortest path to reflect feature splits that alter model
decisions while maintaining lower entropy. We perform local sampling on
manifold-like distances computed by variational auto-encoders to reflect data
density. CEnt is the first non-gradient-based contrastive method generating
diverse counterfactuals that do not necessarily exist in the training data
while satisfying immutability (ex. race) and semi-immutability (ex. age can
only change in an increasing direction). Empirical evaluation on four
real-world numerical datasets demonstrates the ability of CEnt in generating
counterfactuals that achieve better proximity rates than existing methods
without compromising latency, feasibility, and attainability. We further extend
CEnt to imagery data to derive visually appealing and useful contrasts between
class labels on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets. Finally, we show how CEnt can
serve as a tool to detect vulnerabilities of textual classifiers.

long-term temporal modeling module to model the global temporal relations based
on the extracted spatial appearance features. Meanwhile, we design another
short-term temporal modeling module to encode the motion characteristics

be obtained by feeding the embedded rich spatial-temporal features to a common

prediction has a wide range of applications. The fundamental challenge in
traffic flow prediction is to effectively model the complex spatial-temporal
dependencies in traffic data. Spatial-temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN)
models have emerged as one of the most promising methods to solve this problem.
However, GNN-based models have three major limitations for traffic prediction:
i) Most methods model spatial dependencies in a static manner, which limits the
ability to learn dynamic urban traffic patterns; ii) Most methods only consider
short-range spatial information and are unable to capture long-range spatial
dependencies; iii) These methods ignore the fact that the propagation of
traffic conditions between locations has a time delay in traffic systems. To
this end, we propose a novel Propagation Delay-aware dynamic long-range
transFormer, namely PDFormer, for accurate traffic flow prediction.
Specifically, we design a spatial self-attention module to capture the dynamic
spatial dependencies. Then, two graph masking matrices are introduced to
highlight spatial dependencies from short- and long-range views. Moreover, a
traffic delay-aware feature transformation module is proposed to empower
PDFormer with the capability of explicitly modeling the time delay of spatial
information propagation. Extensive experimental results on six real-world
public traffic datasets show that our method can not only achieve
state-of-the-art performance but also exhibit competitive computational
efficiency. Moreover, we visualize the learned spatial-temporal attention map
to make our model highly interpretable.

COVID-19 (distinguishing several SARS-CoV-2 variants) with different sampling
strategies to assess their impact on genomic surveillance. In particular, we
compare adaptive sampling, i.e., dynamically reallocating resources between
screening at points of entry and inside communities, and constant sampling,
i.e., assigning fixed resources to the two locations. We show that adaptive
sampling uncovers new variants up to five weeks earlier than constant sampling,
significantly reducing detection delays and estimation errors. This advantage
is most prominent at low sequencing rates. Although increasing the sequencing
rate has a similar effect, the marginal benefits of doing so may not always
justify the associated costs. Consequently, it is convenient for countries with
comparatively few resources to operate at lower sequencing rates, thereby
profiting the most from adaptive sampling. Finally, our methodology can be

enclosed self-propelled particles can adhere to the membrane. A vesicle is
represented by a dynamically triangulated membrane, while the adhesive active
particles are modelled as active Brownian particles (ABPs) that interact with
the membrane via the Lennard-Jones potential. Phase diagrams of dynamic vesicle
shapes as a function of ABP activity and particle volume fraction inside the
vesicle are constructed for different strengths of adhesive interactions. At
low ABP activity, adhesive interactions dominate over the propulsion forces,
such that the vesicle attains near static configurations, with protrusions of
membrane-wrapped ABPs having ring-like and sheet-like structures. At moderate
particle densities and strong enough activities, active vesicles show dynamic
highly-branched tethers filled with string-like arrangements of ABPs, which do
not occur in the absence of particle adhesion to the membrane. At large volume
fractions of ABPs, vesicles fluctuate for moderate particle activities, and
elongate and finally split into two vesicles for large ABP propulsion
strengths. We also analyze membrane tension, active fluctuations, and ABP
characteristics (e.g., mobility, clustering), and compare them to the case of
active vesicles with non-adhesive ABPs. The adhesion of ABPs to the membrane
significantly alters the behavior of active vesicles, and provides an
additional parameter for controlling their behavior.

witness operator or not. It may be expressed in terms of the following
quantities such as (i) the eigenvalues of the product of the given three-qubit
state and the composite system of single qubit maximally mixed state and
reduced two-qubit state and (ii) the non-locality of reduced two-qubit state.
We then achieve the inequality whose violation may detect the genuine
non-locality of any three-qubit state. Few examples are cited to support our
obtained results. Lastly, we discuss its possible implementation in the
laboratory.

Although its appearance editing has been studied, how to achieve

present RecolorNeRF, a novel user-friendly color editing approach for the

pure-colored layers, forming a palette. By this means, color manipulation can
be conducted by altering the color components of the palette directly. To
support efficient palette-based editing, the color of each layer needs to be as
representative as possible. In the end, the problem is formulated as an
optimization problem, where the layers and their blending weights are jointly
optimized with the NeRF itself. Extensive experiments show that our
jointly-optimized layer decomposition can be used against multiple backbones
and produce photo-realistic recolored novel-view renderings. We demonstrate
that RecolorNeRF outperforms baseline methods both quantitatively and
qualitatively for color editing even in complex real-world scenes.

connections can be pruned with little to no effect on accuracy. But when we
cross a critical level of parameter sparsity, pruning any further leads to a
sudden drop in accuracy. This drop plausibly reflects a loss in model
complexity, which we aim to avoid. In this work, we explore how sparsity also
affects the geometry of the linear regions defined by a neural network, and
consequently reduces the expected maximum number of linear regions based on the
architecture. We observe that pruning affects accuracy similarly to how
sparsity affects the number of linear regions and our proposed bound for the
maximum number. Conversely, we find out that selecting the sparsity across
layers to maximize our bound very often improves accuracy in comparison to
pruning as much with the same sparsity in all layers, thereby providing us
guidance on where to prune.

multi-core architectures. Reasoning techniques for concurrent programs, like
Owicki-Gries-style proof calculi, have to be based on such a semantics, and
hence need to be freshly developed for every new memory model. Recently, a more
uniform approach to reasoning has been proposed which builds correctness proofs
on the basis of a number of core axioms. This allows to prove program
correctness independent of memory models, and transfers proofs to specific
memory models by showing these to instantiate all axioms required in a proof.
The axiomatisation is built on the notion of thread views as first class
elements in the semantics. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of
this form of axiomatic reasoning to the Partial Store Order (PSO) memory model.
As the standard semantics for PSO is not based on views, we first of all
provide a view-based semantics for PSO and prove it to coincide with the
standard semantics. We then show the new view-based semantics to satisfy all
but one axiom. The missing axiom refers to message-passing (MP) abilities of
memory models, which PSO does not guarantee. As a consequence, only proofs
without usage of the MP axiom are transferable to PSO. We illustrate the
reasoning technique by proving correctness of a litmus test employing a fence
to ensure message passing.

high-quality samples from complex data distributions. These models are able to
capture sophisticated patterns and structures in the data, and can generate
samples that are highly diverse and representative of the underlying
distribution. However, one of the main limitations of diffusion models is the
complexity of sample generation, since a large number of inference timesteps is
required to faithfully capture the data distribution. In this paper, we present
MMD-DDM, a novel method for fast sampling of diffusion models. Our approach is
based on the idea of using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to finetune the
learned distribution with a given budget of timesteps. This allows the
finetuned model to significantly improve the speed-quality trade-off, by
substantially increasing fidelity in inference regimes with few steps or,
equivalently, by reducing the required number of steps to reach a target
fidelity, thus paving the way for a more practical adoption of diffusion models
in a wide range of applications. We evaluate our approach on unconditional
image generation with extensive experiments across the CIFAR-10, CelebA,
ImageNet and LSUN-Church datasets. Our findings show that the proposed method
is able to produce high-quality samples in a fraction of the time required by
widely-used diffusion models, and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for

on such libraries exposes a project to potential vulnerabilities and may put an
application and its users at risk. Unfortunately, research on software
ecosystems has shown that the number of projects that are affected by such
vulnerabilities is rising. Previous investigations usually reason about
dependencies on the dependency level, but we believe that this highly inflates
the actual number of affected projects. In this work, we study the effect of
transitivity and granularity on vulnerability propagation in the Maven
ecosystem. In our research methodology, we gather a large dataset of 3M recent
Maven packages. We obtain the full transitive set of dependencies for this
dataset, construct whole-program call graphs, and perform reachability
analysis. This approach allows us to identify Maven packages that are actually
affected by using vulnerable dependencies. Our empirical results show that: (1)
about 1/3 of packages in our dataset are identified as vulnerable if and only
if all the transitive dependencies are considered. (2) less than 1% of packages
have a reachable call path to vulnerable code in their dependencies, which is
far lower than that of a naive dependency-based analysis. (3) limiting the
depth of the resolved dependency tree might be a useful technique to reduce
computation time for expensive fine-grained (vulnerability) analysis. We
discuss the implications of our work and provide actionable insights for

dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD) is proposed for feature selection and
variables clustering in reacting flow simulations. The hierarchical HODMD
(h-HODMD) performs a reduction of the model order, followed by the iterative
selection of the best reconstructed variables thus creating clusters of
features which can eventually be associated with distinct dynamical phenomena.
Firstly, h-HODMD is combined with different data pre-processing techniques to
assess their influence on the algorithm in terms of reconstruction error.
Afterwards, the algorithm is applied to analyze three different databases
obtained from numerical simulations of a non-premixed co-flow methane flame,
and its performance are compared with the standard HODMD in terms of the
achievable degree of reduction as well as in terms of reconstruction error.
Results show that h-HODMD improves the reconstruction for all the variables
when compared to the standard HODMD algorithm. This condition is achieved
thanks to the iterative variables' clustering: finding dedicated modes for a
specific group of features does in fact lead to a better reconstruction of the
dynamics with respect to the case when the same (global) modes are used to
reconstruct the entire set of variables. Finally, the clusters of variables
found by means of h-HODMD are analyzed, and it is observed that the algorithm
can group chemical species whose behavior is also consistent from a kinetic
point of view. In fact, it allows for the possibility to formulate inexpensive
reduced dynamical models for predicting flames liftoff, as well as for
identifying the formation of local extinction and blowout conditions, to
formulate accurate reduced models to describe the formation of pollutants in

sickness. It hinders the passengers' willingness to perform secondary
activities. In order to mitigate motion sickness in automated vehicles, we
propose an optimization-based motion planning algorithm that minimizes the
distribution of acceleration energy within the frequency range that is found to
be the most nauseogenic. The algorithm is formulated into integral and
receding-horizon variants and compared with a commonly used alternative
approach aiming to minimize accelerations in general. The proposed approach can
reduce frequency-weighted acceleration by up to 11.3% compared with not
considering the frequency sensitivity for the price of reduced overall
acceleration comfort. Our simulation studies also reveal a loss of performance
by the receding-horizon approach over the integral approach when varying the
preview time and nominal sampling time. The computation time of the
receding-horizon planner is around or below the real-time threshold when using
a longer sampling time but without causing significant performance loss. We
also present the results of experiments conducted to measure the performance of
human drivers on a public road section that the simulated scenario is actually
based on. The proposed method can achieve a 19\% improvement in general
acceleration comfort or a 32% reduction in squared motion sickness dose value
over the best-performing participant. The results demonstrate considerable
potential for improving motion comfort and mitigating motion sickness using our
approach in automated vehicles.

regularization of high-density regions in the latent space to improve

  The flows computed with the coherent structure tracking (CST) technique on
the whole surface of the Sun allow for the texture of the velocity modulus to
be analyzed and for one to locate the largest horizontal flows and determine
their organization. The velocity modulus maps show structures more or less
circular and closedwhich are visible at all latitudes; here they are referred
to as donuts. They reflect the most active convective cells associated with
supergranulation. These annular flows are not necessarily joined as would seem
to indicate the divergence maps. The donuts have identical properties
(amplitude, shape, inclination, etc.) regardless of their position on the Sun.
The kinematic simulation of the donuts' outflow applied to passive scalar
(corks) indicates the preponderant action of the selected donuts which are,
from our analysis, one of the major actors for the magnetic field diffusion on
the quiet Sun. The absence of donuts in the magnetized areas (plages) indicates
the action of the magnetic field on the strongest supergranular flows and thus
modifies the diffusion of the magnetic field in that location. The detection of
the donuts is a way to locate in the quiet Sun the vortex and the link with the
jet, blinkers, coronal bright points (campfires), or other physical structures.
Likewise, the study of the influence of donuts on the evolution of active

and transverse oscillations of a quiescent filament trigged by a two-sided-loop

pushed the filament mass moving northwardly along the magnetic field lines
consisting of the coronal cavity, then some elevated filament mass fell back
and started to oscillate longitudinally at the bottom of the cavity (i.e., the
magnetic dip). The northernmost part of the filament also showed transverse
oscillation simultaneously. The amplitude and period of the longitudinal
(transverse) oscillation are 12.96 (2.99) Mm and 1.18 (0.33) hours,
respectively. By using the method of filament seismology, the radius of
curvature of the magnetic dip is about 151 Mm, consistent with that obtained by
the 3D reconstruction (166 Mm). Using different physical parameters of the
observed longitudinal and transverse oscillations, the magnetic field strength
of the filament is estimated to be about 23 and 21 Gauss, respectively. By
calculating the energy of the moving filament mass, the minimum energy of the

accurate stellar ages for a large sample of stars is essential although
challenging. In this work, we present the asteroseismic age determination of
5306 red giant branch stars using \kepler{} and LAMOST data, with a thorough
examination of how the age determination is affected by the choice of different
temperature scales and stellar models. Thanks to the high precision of the
asteroseismic and spectroscopic parameters of our sample stars, we are able to
achieve age determination with an average accuracy of 12 per cent. However, the
age determination is sensitively dependent on the adopted temperature scale, as
50\,K difference in effective temperature may cause larger than 10 per cent
systematic uncertainty in the age estimates. Using the ages derived with the
most plausible set of the temperature scale, we study the age distribution of
the chemical thin disc stars, and present an estimate of the formation epoch of
the first Galactic thin disc stars. We find that the first (oldest) thin disc
stars have an age of $9.5^{+0.5(\rm rand.)+0.5(\rm sys.)}_{-0.4(\rm
rand.)-0.3(\rm sys.)}$\,Gyr, where the systematic uncertainties reflect ages
estimated using different stellar evolutionary models. At this epoch, the
Galactic thick disc was still forming stars, indicating there is a time window
when both the thin and thick discs of our Galaxy were forming stars together.
Moreover, we find that the first thin disc stars exhibit a broad distribution
of Galactocentric radii, suggesting that the inner and outer thin discs began
to form simultaneously.

determine a high probability lower bound on the resultant finite excitation of

gain-scheduling controller design that guarantees robust performance. This
leads to a semidefinite program-based design which computes an exploration
strategy with finite excitation bounds and minimal energy, and a gain-scheduled

losing contact with the terrain surface by reducing the robot's momentum
change. RAMP minimizes the swing momentum with a Low-Reaction Swing Trajectory
(LRST) while distributing this momentum to the whole body, ensuring zero

the proposed approach with dynamic simulations indicating the capability of

  decarbonizing the multi-energy system of a manufacturing company","23 pages, 28 figures, research paper",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY econ.EM stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Digitalization and sector coupling enable companies to turn into flexumers.
By using the flexibility of their multi-energy system (MES), they reduce costs
and carbon emissions while stabilizing the electricity system. However, to
identify the necessary investments in energy conversion and storage
technologies to leverage demand response (DR) potentials, companies need to
assess the value of flexibility. Therefore, this study quantifies the
flexibility value of a production company's MES by optimizing the synthesis,
design, and operation of a decarbonizing MES considering self-consumption
optimization, peak shaving, and integrated DR based on hourly prices and carbon
emission factors (CEFs). The detailed case study of a beverage company in
northern Germany considers vehicle-to-X of powered industrial trucks,
power-to-heat on multiple temperatures, wind turbines, photovoltaic systems,
and energy storage systems (thermal energy, electricity, and hydrogen). We
propose and apply novel data-driven metrics to evaluate the intensity of
price-based and CEF-based DR. The results reveal that flexibility usage reduces
decarbonization costs (by 19-80% depending on electricity and carbon removal
prices), total annual costs, operating carbon emissions, energy-weighted
average prices and CEFs, and fossil energy dependency. The results also suggest
that a net-zero operational carbon emission MES requires flexibility, which, in
an economic case, is provided by a combination of different flexible
technologies and storage systems that complement each other. While the value of
flexibility depends on various market and consumer-specific factors such as
electricity or carbon removal prices, this study highlights the importance of
demand flexibility for the decarbonization of MESs.

operate in normal conditions avoiding explosive synchronization. Here, we have
discovered that synchronization in networks where the oscillators are coupled

explosive to standard synchronization in neuronal-like systems. We prove
analytically that explosive synchronization emerges when using this theoretical
setting in star-like (neuronal) networks. As soon as this star-like network is
topologically converted to a network containing cycles, e.g., via synaptic
connections to other neurons, the explosive synchronization gives rise to
classical synchronization. This allows us to hypothesize that such topological

dynamics of gravity-induced convective transport with that reported in the
literature. Results show good agreement for both the characteristics of
descending fingers and the associated dissolution rate. The developed simulator

with heterogeneous geological layers is discretized into a two-dimensional
computational domain where numerical simulation is performed. Impacts of
hysteresis and the diffusion of CO2 in liquid phase on the migration and
trapping of CO2 plume are investigated. Inclusion of the hysteresis effect does
not affect plume migration in this benchmark model, whereas diffusion plays an
important role in promoting convective mixing. This work casts a promising
approach to predict the migration of the CO2 plume, and to assess the amount of
trapping from different mechanisms for long-term CO2 storage.

of linguistic units, such as syllables, words, and sentences. It has been
hypothesized that the time scale of cortical activity encoding each linguistic
unit is commensurate with the time scale of that linguistic unit in speech.
Evidence for the hypothesis originally comes from studies using the
frequency-tagging paradigm that presents each linguistic unit at a constant
rate, and more recently extends to studies on natural speech. For natural
speech, it is sometimes assumed that neural encoding of different levels of
linguistic units is captured by the neural response tracking speech envelope in
different frequency bands (e.g., around 1 Hz for phrases, around 2 Hz for
words, and around 4 Hz for syllables). Here, we analyze the coherence between
speech envelope and idealized responses, each of which tracks a single level of
linguistic unit. Four units, i.e., phones, syllables, words, and sentences, are
separately considered. It is shown that the idealized phone-, syllable-, and
word-tracking responses all correlate with the speech envelope both around 3-6
Hz and below ~1 Hz. Further analyses reveal that the 1-Hz correlation mainly
originates from the pauses in connected speech. The results here suggest that a
simple frequency-domain decomposition of envelope-tracking activity cannot
separate the neural responses to different linguistic units in natural speech.

non-convex multi-player games, and casts the complementary problem into a

We then prove the existence condition of global NE: the solution to the VI
problem satisfies a duality relation. Based on this VI formulation, we design a
conjugate-based ordinary differential equation (ODE) to approach global NE,
which is proved to have an exponential convergence rate. To make the dynamics
more implementable, we further derive a discretized algorithm. We apply our
algorithm to two typical scenarios: multi-player generalized monotone game and
multi-player potential game. In the two settings, we prove that the step-size

The electrons may either arise from a laser plasma instability, or from the

useful, and simple enough to be incorporated into a radiation hydrodynamics

That is why analytic insights become important, they allow one to simplify the
Fokker Planck theory so that a solution of it can be incorporated into a

a steady state Fokker Planck theory for plasmas of arbitrary Z. It developes a
method of solving the simplified Fokker Planck method with a technique called

changes in the environment (e.g. positions of obstacles in the maze, size of

adaptive curriculum of environments (generated automatically) to improve

superconducting under certain conditions (AuTe$_2$ and SrAuSi$_3$). Compounds
of another noble element, Ag, are also relatively rare, and very few of them

silver) is a challenge - especially having in mind that the best high-$T_c$
superconductors at normal conditions are based upon their rather close
''relative'', Cu. Here we report combined X-ray diffraction, Raman, and
resistivity measurements, as well as first-principles calculations, to explore
the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the properties of the sylvanite mineral,
AuAgTe$_4$. Our experimental results, supported by density functional theory,
reveal a structural phase transition at $\sim$5 GPa from a monoclinic $P2/c$ to
$P2/m$ phase, resulting in almost identical coordinations of Au and Ag ions,
with rather uniform interatomic distances. Further, resistivity measurements
show the onset of superconductivity at $\sim$1.5 GPa in the $P2/c$ phase,
followed by a linear increase of $T_c$ up to the phase transition, with a
maximum in the $P2/m$ phase, and a gradual decrease afterwards. Our
calculations indicate phonon-mediated superconductivity, with the
electron-phonon coupling coming predominantly from the low-energy phonon modes.
Thus, along with the discovery of a new superconducting compound of
gold/silver, our results advance understanding of the mechanism of the
superconductivity in Au-containing compounds, which may pave the way to the
discovery of novel ones.

practical solutions with low computational time are essential to cope with
frequent updates in user-requirements that might occur. In this context, we
formulate an optimization problem to determine the optimal user association and
resource allocation in the network, while the serving time is partitioned into
a series of time periods. Therefore, cooperative ANN models are designed to
estimate and predict the association and resource allocation variables for each
user such that sub-optimal solutions can be obtained within a certain period of
time prior to its actual starting, which makes the solutions valid and in
accordance with the demands of the users at a given time. The results show the

the same time, monitor the execution of complex tasks. In this paper, we
present a novel architecture for dynamic role allocation and collaborative task
planning in a mixed human-robot team of arbitrary size. The architecture
capitalizes on a centralized reactive and modular task-agnostic planning method
based on Behavior Trees (BTs), in charge of actions scheduling, while the
allocation problem is formulated through a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP),
that assigns dynamically individual roles or collaborations to the agents of
the team. Different metrics used as MILP cost allow the architecture to favor
various aspects of the collaboration (e.g. makespan, ergonomics, human
preferences). Human preference are identified through a negotiation phase, in
which, an human agent can accept/refuse to execute the assigned task.In
addition, bilateral communication between humans and the system is achieved
through an Augmented Reality (AR) custom user interface that provides intuitive
functionalities to assist and coordinate workers in different action phases.
The computational complexity of the proposed methodology outperforms literature
approaches in industrial sized jobs and teams (problems up to 50 actions and 20
agents in the team with collaborations are solved within 1\;s). The different
allocated roles, as the cost functions change, highlights the flexibility of
the architecture to several production requirements. Finally, the subjective
evaluation demonstrating the high usability level and the suitability for the
targeted scenario.

and characterise fast-time variations ($\gtrsim 1$s) in the non-thermal hard
X-ray (HXR) time profiles of solar flares using high-resolution data from Solar
Orbiter's Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX).
  Methods: The HXR time profiles were smoothed using Gaussian Process (GP)
regression. The time profiles were then fitted with a linear combination of
Gaussians to decompose the time profile. From the Gaussian decomposition, key
characteristics such as the periodicity, full width at half maximum (FWHM),
time evolution, and amplitude can be derived.
  Results: We present the outcome of applying this method to four M and X
GOES-class flares from the first year of Solar Orbiter science operations. The
HXR time profiles of these flares were decomposed into individual Gaussians and
their periods were derived. The quality of fit is quantified by the standard
deviation of the residuals (difference between observed and fitted curve,
normalised by the error on the observed data), for which we obtain $\leq 1.8$
for all flares presented. In this work, the first detection of fast-time
variations with Solar Orbiter's STIX instrument has been made on timescales
across the range of 4-128s.
  Conclusions: A new method for identifying and characterising fast-time
variations in the non-thermal HXR profiles of solar flares has been developed,
in which the time profiles are fit with a linear combination of Gaussian
bursts. The opportunity to study time variations in flares has greatly improved
with the new observations from STIX on Solar Orbiter.

respectively by WMAP and Planck. We identify 19 filaments, 13 of which have
been previously observed. For each filament, we study the polarization
fraction, finding values typically larger than for the areas outside the
filaments, excluding the Galactic plane, and a fraction of about 30% is reached
in two filaments. We study the polarization spectral indices of the filaments,
and find a spectral index consistent with the values found in previous analysis
(about -3.1) for more diffuse regions. Decomposing the polarization signals
into the $E$ and $B$ families, we find that most of the filaments are detected
in $P_E$, but not in $P_B$. We then focus on understanding the statistical
properties of the diffuse regions of the synchrotron emission at 23 GHz. Using
Minkowski functionals and tensors, we analyse the non-Gaussianity and
statistical isotropy of the polarized intensity maps. For a sky coverage
corresponding to 80% of the fainter emission, and on scales smaller than 6
degrees ($\ell > 30$), the deviations from Gaussianity and isotropy are
significantly higher than 3$\sigma$. The level of deviation decreases for
smaller scales, however, it remains significantly high for the lowest analised
scale ($\sim 1.5^\circ$). When 60% sky coverage is analysed, we find that the
deviations never exceed 3$\sigma$. Finally, we present a simple data-driven
model to generate non-Gaussian and anisotropic simulations of the synchrotron
polarized emission. The simulations are fitted in order to match the spectral

often tuned via cross validation schemes. Here we leverage approaches and tools
from the machine learning community to introduce two-layered kernel machines,

optimized not only in the Euclidean directions, but that further incorporates
kernel rotations. The kernel optimization is shown to be robust by using
recently improved calculations of cross validation scores. Finally, the use of
greedy approaches, and specifically of the Vectorial Kernel Orthogonal Greedy

We show how to formulate the constitutive equation by using a convenient
decomposition of the relaxation tensor into scalar components and tensorial
bases. We show that the bases must be symmetrically additive, i.e they must sum
up to the symmetric fourth-order identity tensor. This is a fundamental
property both for isotropic and anisotropic bases that ensures the constitutive
equation is consistent with the elastic limit. We provide two robust methods to
obtain such bases. Furthermore, we show that, in the transversely isotropic
case, the bases are naturally deformation-dependent for deformation modes that
induce rotation or stretching of the fibres. Therefore, the Modified
Quasi-Linear Viscoelastic framework allows to capture the non-linear phenomenon
of strain-dependent relaxation, which has always been a criticised limitation
of the original Quasi-Linear Viscoelastic theory. We illustrate this intrinsic
non-linear feature, unique to the Modified Quasi-Linear Viscoelastic model,

turbulent regions generated during cluster mergers where particles are
re-accelerated. In this framework, RHs are expected to probe cluster dynamics
and are predicted to be more frequent in massive systems. Statistical studies
are important to study the connection of RHs with cluster dynamics and to
constrain theoretical models. Furthermore, low-frequency surveys can shed light
on the existence of RHs with very steep radio-spectra, a key prediction of
turbulent models. We study the properties of RHs from clusters of the second
catalog of Planck Sunyaev Zel'dovich detected sources that lie within the 5634
deg^2 covered by the second Data Release (DR2) of the LOFAR Two-meter Sky

the re-acceleration scenario. In addition, the fraction of clusters with RHs
increases with the cluster mass, confirming the leading role of the
gravitational process of cluster formation in the generation of RHs. These
models predict a large fraction of RHs with very steep spectrum in the DR2

occurrence of halos in GMRT and LOFAR samples indeed shows a larger occurrence
of RHs at lower frequencies suggesting the presence of a number of very steep

minimum-stint-time for a given charge time and stint length, whilst the upper
level leverages that information to jointly optimize the stint length, charge
time and number of pit stops, in order to maximize the driven distance in the
course of a fixed-time endurance race. Specifically, we first extend a convex
lap time optimization framework to capture low-level vehicle dynamics and
thermal models, and use it to create a map linking the charge time and stint
length to the achievable stint time. Second, we leverage the map to frame the
maximum-race-distance problem as a mixed-integer second order conic program

off-the-shelf optimization algorithms. Finally, we showcase our framework on a
6h race around the Zandvoort circuit. Our results show that the optimal race

optimizing the stints and number of pit stops can significantly increase the

has two main challenges: how to represent this information in a form that is
feedable to the GANs and how to effectively feed the representation to the GAN.
To address these issues, we developed a suitable representation of CNN
architectures by cumulatively averaging intermediate interpretation maps. We
also propose two alternative approaches to feed the representations to the GAN
and to choose an effective training strategy. Our approach learned the general
aspects of CNNs and was agnostic to datasets and CNN architectures. The study
includes both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and compares the
proposed GANs with state-of-the-art approaches. We found that the initial
layers of CNNs and final layers are equally crucial for interpreting CNNs upon
interpreting the proposed GAN. We believe training a GAN to interpret CNNs
would open doors for improved interpretations by leveraging fast-paced deep

spectrum of objects. However, the existing infrared and visible image fusion
methods rarely explore how to handle multi-spectral/channel data directly and
achieve high color fidelity. This paper addresses the above issue by proposing
a novel method with diffusion models, termed as Dif-Fusion, to generate the
distribution of the multi-channel input data, which increases the ability of
multi-source information aggregation and the fidelity of colors. In specific,
instead of converting multi-channel images into single-channel data in existing
fusion methods, we create the multi-channel data distribution with a denoising
network in a latent space with forward and reverse diffusion process. Then, we
use the the denoising network to extract the multi-channel diffusion features
with both visible and infrared information. Finally, we feed the multi-channel
diffusion features to the multi-channel fusion module to directly generate the
three-channel fused image. To retain the texture and intensity information, we
propose multi-channel gradient loss and intensity loss. Along with the current
evaluation metrics for measuring texture and intensity fidelity, we introduce a
new evaluation metric to quantify color fidelity. Extensive experiments
indicate that our method is more effective than other state-of-the-art image
fusion methods, especially in color fidelity.

which is challenging to predict quantitatively. Here, using a curated dataset
of over approx. 3000 inorganic glasses from the literature comprising the
composition, indentation load, and hardness, we develop machine learning (ML)
models to predict the composition and load dependence of Vickers hardness.
Interestingly, when tested on new glass compositions unseen during the
training, the standard data-driven ML model failed to capture the ISE. To
address this gap, we combined an empirical expression (Bernhardt law) to
describe the ISE with ML to develop a framework that incorporates the symbolic
law representing the domain reasoning in ML, namely Symbolic Reasoning-Informed
ML Procedure (SRIMP). We show that the resulting SRIMP outperforms the
data-driven ML model in predicting the ISE. Finally, we interpret the SRIMP
model to understand the contribution of the glass network formers and modifiers
toward composition and load-dependent (ISE) and load-independent hardness. The
deconvolution of the hardness into load-dependent and load-independent terms
paves the way toward a holistic understanding of composition and ISE in
glasses, enabling the accelerated discovery of new glass compositions with
targeted hardness.

instability to large amplitude remains a challenge as no general theory exists.
In this paper, we consider a three component reaction-diffusion system with one
of its components singularly perturbed, this component is known as the fast
variable. We develop an analytical theory describing the periodic patterns
emerging from a Turing instability using geometric singular perturbation
theory. We show analytically that after the initial Turing instability,
spatially periodic patterns evolve into a small amplitude spike in the fast
variable whose amplitude grows as one moves away from onset. This is followed
by a secondary transition where the spike in the fast variable widens, its
periodic pattern develops two sharp transitions between two flat states and the
amplitudes of the other variables grow. The final type of transition we uncover
analytically is where the flat states of the fast variable develop structure in
the periodic pattern. The analysis is illustrated and motivated by a numerical
investigation. We conclude with a preliminary numerical investigation where we
uncover more complicated periodic patterns and snaking-like behaviour that are
driven by the three transitions analysed in this paper. This paper provides a

high penetration loss due to large blockages in harsh propagation environments
is often an issue that severely degrades communication performance. Considering
that intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is capable of constructing digitally
controllable reflection links in a low-cost manner, we investigate an
IRS-enhanced downlink cell-free MIMO network in this paper. We aim to maximize
the sum rate of all the users by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at
the BSs and the reflection coefficients at the IRS. To address the optimization
problem, we propose a fully distributed machine learning algorithm. Different
from the conventional iterative optimization algorithms that require a central
processing at the central processing unit (CPU) and large amount of channel
state information and signaling exchange between the BSs and the CPU, in the
proposed algorithm, each BS can locally design its beamforming vectors.
Meanwhile, the IRS reflection coefficients are determined by one of the BSs.
Simulation results show that the deployment of IRS can significantly boost the
sum user rate and that the proposed algorithm can achieve a high sum user rate
with a low computational complexity.

  Focusing on the approach of hand-implemented ODE-backpropagation, we develop
the computation for the Hessian of orbit-nonclosure for a mechanical system. We
also clarify the mathematical framework for extending the

performed in a language, defined in terms of a formal grammar, that we
introduce to facilitate the tracking of intermediate quantities.
  As pedagogical examples, we discuss the Hessian of orbit-nonclosure for the
higher dimensional harmonic oscillator and conceptually related problems in
Newtonian gravitational theory. In particular, applying our approach to the
figure-8 three-body orbit, we readily rediscover a distorted-figure-8 solution
originally described by Sim\'o.

majorization-minimization is presented to obtain the constant-envelope

quadratic function as the minorizer, leading to a low-complexity solution at
each iteration. In addition, to further facilitate low-cost implementation of

spatially explicit individual-based models with contest competition: where
species compete for space in local cells and then disperse to nearby cells. We
start by describing simulations of the model, which exhibit large-scale
discrete oscillations and characterise these oscillations by measuring spatial
correlations. We then develop two new approximate descriptions of the resulting
spatial population dynamics. The first is based on local interactions of the
individuals and allows us to give a difference equation approximation of the

interactions of the individual-based model. These approximations capture
demographic stochasticity from the individual-based model and show that
dispersal stabilizes population dynamics. We calculate extinction probability

the presence of two near-degenerate two-body continua. The influence of such a
near-degeneracy on the few-body physics in the vicinity of a narrow Feshbach
resonance is investigated within the framework of a minimal model with two
atomic continua and one closed molecular channel. The model allows analysis of
the spin composition of loosely bound dimers and trimers. In the two-body
sector the well-established coupled-channels calculations phenomenology of
lithium is qualitatively reproduced, and its particularities are emphasized and
clarified. In the three-body sector we find that the Efimov trimer energy
levels follow a different functional form as compared to a single continuum
scenario while the thresholds remain untouched. This three-channel model with
two atomic continua complements our earlier developed three-channel model with
two molecular channels [Y. Yudkin and L. Khaykovich, Phys. Rev. A 103, 063303

influence of both deterministic and stochastic forces are prevalent in all
fields of science. Yet, identifying these systems from sparse-in-time
observations remains still a challenging endeavour. Existing approaches focus
either on the temporal structure of the observations by relying on conditional
expectations, discarding thereby information ingrained in the geometry of the
system's invariant density; or employ geometric approximations of the invariant
density, which are nevertheless restricted to systems with conservative forces.
Here we propose a method that reconciles these two paradigms. We introduce a
new data-driven path augmentation scheme that takes the local observation
geometry into account. By employing non-parametric inference on the augmented
paths, we can efficiently identify the deterministic driving forces of the
underlying system for systems observed at low sampling rates.

This extension allows to link the convergence with the problem of minimizing
the norm of a small rational matrix over the spectra or field-of-values of the

four epochs of imaging polarimetry up to +108 d. The spectropolarimetry at +3 d
shows increasing polarisation degree P towards the redder wavelengths and
exhibits signs of axial symmetry, but at +29 d P=0 throughout the spectrum
implying that the photosphere of SN 2017gci evolved from a slightly aspherical
configuration to a more spherical one in the first month post-peak. However, an
increase of P to 0.5% at +55 d accompanied by a different orientation of the
axial symmetry compared to +3 d implies the presence of additional sources of
polarisation at this phase. The increase in polarisation is possibly caused by
interaction with circumstellar matter as already suggested by a knee in the
light curve and a possible detection of broad Ha emission. We also analysed the
sample of all 16 SLSNe-I with polarimetry to date. The data taken during the
early spectroscopic phase show consistently low P indicating spherical
photospheres. No clear relation between the polarimetry and spectral phase was
seen when the spectra resemble Type Ic SNe during the photospheric and nebular
phases. The light curve decline rate also shows no clear relation with the
polarisation properties. While only slow-evolving SLSNe-I have shown non-zero
P, the fast-evolving ones have not been observed at sufficiently late times to
conclude that none of them exhibit changing P. However, the four SLSNe-I with
increasing polarisation degree also have irregular light curve declines. For up
to half of them, the photometric, spectroscopic and polarimetric properties are
affected by CSM interaction. As such CSM interaction clearly plays an important
role in understanding the polarimetric evolution of SLSNe-I.

multiple other phases, typically insulating ones, that are in close competition
with SC. It is highly challenging to resolve this competition with quantitative
numerics for the group of quasi-two-dimensional materials such as the cuprates.
This is the case even for the simplified minimal models of these materials, the
doped 2D Hubbard model with repulsive interactions, where clusters of
sufficient size to determine the phase in the thermodynamic limit can be
hard-to-impossible to treat in practice. The present work shows how
quasi-one-dimensional systems, 2D and 3D arrays of weakly coupled 1D correlated
electrons, are much more amenable to resolve the competition between SC and
insulating orders on an equal footing using matrix-product states (MPS). Using
the recently established MPS plus mean field (MPS+MF) approach for fermions, we
demonstrate that large systems are readily reachable in these systems, and thus
the thermodynamic regime by extrapolation. Focusing on basic model systems, 3D
arrays of negative-U Hubbard chains with additional nearest-neighbor
interaction V, we show that despite the MF component of the MPS+MF technique we
can reproduce the expected coexistence of SC and charge-density wave at V=0 for
density n=1. We then show how we can tune away from coexistence by both tuning
V and doping the system. This work paves the way to deploy two-channel MPS+MF
theory on some highly demanding high-$T_c$ SC systems, such as 3D arrays of
repulsive-U doped Hubbard ladders, where we have recently characterized the
properties of such arrays in single-channel MPS+MF calculations. The present
approach could thus conclusively show that this SC order would actually be
obtained, by explicitly comparing SC against its insulating competitors.

spacetime. Recently, we have shown that the same algorithm applied to the
Papapetrou antiscalar spacetime produces a rotational metric devoid of horizons
and ergospheres. Though exact in the scalar sector, this metric, however,
satisfies the Einstein equations only asymptotically. We argue that this
discrepancy between geometric and matter parts (essential only inside
gravitational radius scale) is caused by the violation of the Hawking-Ellis
energy conditions for the scalar energy-momentum tensor. The axial potential
functions entering the metrics appear to be of the same form both in vacuum and
scalar background, and they also coincide with the linearized Yang-Mills field,
which might hint at their common non-gravitational origin. As an alternative to
the Kerr-type spacetimes produced by Newman-Janis algorithm we suggest the
exact solution obtained by local rotational coordinate transformation from the
Schwarzschild spacetime. Then, comparison with the Kerr-type metrics shows that
the Lense-Thirring phenomenon might be treated as a coordinate effect, similar
to the Coriolis force.

to be properly imaged by interferometers. This problem arises in many areas of
radio astronomy, such as in the study of galaxy clusters, which may host
Mpc-scale diffuse synchrotron sources in the form of radio halos. In clusters
where no radio halos are detected, owing to intrinsic absence of emission or
extrinsic (instrumental and/or observational) effects, it is possible to
determine upper limits. We consider a sample of Planck galaxy clusters from the
Second Data Release of the LOFAR Two Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2) where no
radio halos are detected. We use this sample to test the capabilities of LOFAR
to recover diffuse extended emission and derive upper limits. Through the
injection technique, we simulate radio halos with various surface brightness
profiles. We then predict the corresponding visibilities and image them along
with the real visibilities. This method allows us to test the fraction of flux
density losses owing to inadequate uv-coverage and obtain thresholds at which
the mock emission becomes undetectable by visual inspection. The dense
uv-coverage of LOFAR at short spacings allows to recover $\gtrsim90\%$ of the
flux density of targets with sizes up to $\sim 15'$. We find a relation that
provides upper limits based on the image noise and extent (in terms of number
of beams) of the mock halo. This relation can be safely adopted to obtain upper
limits without injecting when artifacts introduced by the subtraction of the
discrete sources are negligible in the central region of the cluster.
Otherwise, the injection process and visual inspection of the images are
necessary to determine more reliable limits. Through these methods, we obtain
upper limits for 75 clusters to be exploited in ongoing statistical studies.

primordial era of the Universe with the late-time era with the inclusion of
string corrections. In particular, we develop separately the theoretical
framework of Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons theories considering that, the
rescale parameter is constrained to reside in the area $0<\alpha<1$. As
showcased, in the context of the aforementioned theories, a viable inflationary
phenomenology consistent with the latest Planck data can be obtained for both
cases for a wide variety of values. The Swampland criteria which where examined
are satisfied, not necessarily simultaneously, for small values of the rescale
parameter, which is in agreement with the case of a canonical scalar field with
absent string corrective terms. The Gauss-Bonnet model is also further
constrained, in order to obtain a propagation velocity of tensor perturbations
which coincides with that of light, according to the recent observations from
the GW170817. As a result of this assumption the degrees of freedom of the
theory are reduced. An interesting feature which arises from the overall
phenomenology is that, due to the inclusion of string corrections the tensor
spectral index of primordial perturbations is now capable of obtaining a
positive value which is not possible in the case of the canonical scalar field.
Last but not least, the power-law model which is known to be incompatible with
observations is now rendered viable by including a parity violating term and as
showcased, it satisfies the Swampland criteria as well.

learning disparity. Secondly, we \textcolor{black}{explore the use of a multi

Our MTL setup outperformed the single task learning (STL) network in every

1.4 times worse than that of the best MTL performance. The benefit of using MTL
is emphasised when the training data is limited.} A dataset containing

classification with anomaly detection. Existing dense anomaly detectors operate
either through generative modelling of regular training data or by
discriminating with respect to negative training data. These two approaches
optimize different objectives and therefore exhibit different failure modes.
Consequently, we propose the first dense hybrid anomaly score that fuses
generative and discriminative cues. The proposed score can be efficiently
implemented by upgrading any semantic segmentation model with
translation-equivariant estimates of data likelihood and dataset posterior. Our
design is a remarkably good fit for efficient inference on large images due to
negligible computational overhead over the closed-set baseline. The resulting
dense hybrid open-set models require negative training images that can be
sampled either from an auxiliary negative dataset or from a jointly trained
generative model. We evaluate our contributions on benchmarks for dense anomaly

strong open-set performance in spite of negligible computational overhead.

fully-offline data augmentation scheme for improving robot policies that use
eye-in-hand cameras. Our approach leverages neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to
synthetically inject corrective noise into visual demonstrations, using NeRFs
to generate perturbed viewpoints while simultaneously calculating the
corrective actions. This requires no additional expert supervision or
environment interaction, and distills the geometric information in NeRFs into a
real-time reactive RGB-only policy. In a simulated 6-DoF visual grasping

the standard model of a Be/X-ray binary, where the circumstellar disk of the Be
star grows and dissipates on timescales of 9--10 years. We find that the
dissipation of the disk started after a major X-ray outburst. However, the

  Based on a review of a dataset of 100 decision problems, this paper found
that many decision problems have pivotal properties, i.e. properties that
enable solution strategies, and finds 14 such properties. Therefore, an analyst
can first find these properties in a given problem, and then utilize the
strategies they enable. Multi-objective optimization methods could be used to
make investment decisions quantitatively. The analytical complexity of decision
problems can also be scored by evaluating how many of the pivotal properties

Recent studies have also found DPM to be useful in the field of medical image

quantum measurement. In this study, we overturned this common sense by
extracting a single spin from a spin spin magnetic interaction experiment to
demonstrate that the Landauer bound can be broken quantitatively via quantum
spin tunneling. It is the quantum limit, rather than the Landauer bound, that
governs the performance of a spin qubit. An optically manipulated spin encoded
quantum computer is designed, in which energy bound well below the Landauer
bound to erase a spin qubit at the expense of a long spin relaxation time is
theoretically sensible and experimentally verified. This work may represent the
last piece of the puzzle in quantum Landauer erasure in terms of a single spin
being the smallest and the closest to the quantum limit.

function by using the enhanced midpoint integration (EMI). Algorithmic
implementation of the generalized series expansion utilizes two-step iteration
without surd and complex numbers. The computational test we performed reveals
that such a generalization improves accuracy in computation of the arctangent
function by many orders of the magnitude with increasing integer $M$,
associated with subintervals in the EMI formula. The generalized series
expansion may be promising for practical applications. It may be particularly
useful in practical tasks, where extensive computations with arbitrary
precision floating points are needed. The algorithmic implementation of the
generalized series expansion of the arctangent function shows a rapid
convergence rate in the computation of digits of $\pi$ in the Machin-like
formulas.

introduced by P. F. Strawson. It is based on truth-relevant logic described by
M. Richard Diaz in 1981. In another paper I outlined a derivation system for
t-relevant logic based on truth trees. The conclusion was that a tautology is
truth-relevant iff all the variables in a tree are self-contradicted. It is
possible that a tree terminates without all the variables self-contradicting
themselves. In this case the pertaining formula is still a tautology, but not a
truth-relevant tautology. This concept is extended to the predicate calculus,
i.e. a logic of presuppositions or a variant thereof.

  study on strain-induced band-engineering",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The current work describes a novel method of growing thin films of stable
crystalline ST12-Ge, a high pressure polymorph of Ge, on Si substrate by a
non-equilibrium VLS-technique. The study explores the scheme of band
engineering of ST12-Ge by inducing process-stress into it as a function of the
growth temperature and film thickness. In the present work, ST12-Ge films are
grown at 180 C - 250 C to obtain thicknesses of ~4.5-7.5 nm, which possess
extremely good thermal stability up to a temperature of ~350 C. Micro-Raman
study shows the stress induced in such ST12-Ge films to be compressive in
nature and vary in the range of ~0.5-7.5 GPa. The measured direct band gap is
observed to vary within 0.688 eV to 0.711 eV for such stresses, and four
indirect band gaps are obtained to be 0.583 eV, 0.614-0.628 eV, 0.622-0.63 eV
and 0.623-0.632 eV, accordingly. The corresponding band structures for
unstrained and strained ST12-Ge are calculated by performing DFT simulation,
which shows that a compressive stress transforms the fundamental band gap at
M-G valley from indirect to direct one. Henceforth, the possible route of
strain induced band engineering in ST12-Ge is explored by analyzing all the
transitions in strained and unstrained band structures along with
substantiation of the experimental results and theoretical calculations. The
investigation shows that unstrained ST12-Ge is a natural n-type semiconductor
which transforms into p-type upon incorporation of a compressive stress of ~5
GPa, with the in-plane electron effective mass components at M-G band edge to
be ~0.09 me. Therefore, such band engineered ST12-Ge exhibits superior mobility
along with its thermal stability and compatibility with Si, which can have
potential applications to develop high-speed MOS devices for advanced CMOS
technology.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Objective The coordination of human movement directly reflects function of
the central nervous system. Small deficits in movement are often the first sign
of an underlying neurological problem. The objective of this research is to
develop a new end-to-end, deep learning-based system, Rapid-Motion-Track (RMT)
that can track the fastest human movement accurately when webcams or laptop
cameras are used.
  Materials and Methods We applied RMT to finger tapping, a well-validated test
of motor control that is one of the most challenging human motions to track
with computer vision due to the small keypoints of digits and the high
velocities that are generated. We recorded 160 finger tapping assessments
simultaneously with a standard 2D laptop camera (30 frames/sec) and a
high-speed wearable sensor-based 3D motion tracking system (250 frames/sec).
RMT and a range of DLC models were applied to the video data with tapping
frequencies up to 8Hz to extract movement features.
  Results The movement features (e.g. speed, rhythm, variance) identified with
the new RMT system exhibited very high concurrent validity with the
gold-standard measurements (97.3\% of RMT measures were within +/-0.5Hz of the
Optotrak measures), and outperformed DLC and other advanced computer vision
tools (around 88.2\% of DLC measures were within +/-0.5Hz of the Optotrak
measures). RMT also accurately tracked a range of other rapid human movements
such as foot tapping, head turning and sit-to -stand movements.
  Conclusion: With the ubiquity of video technology in smart devices, the RMT
method holds potential to transform access and accuracy of human movement
assessment.

exploited in a plethora of various applications, with sign language recognition
being one of them. However, such algorithms must be fed with a huge amount of
consistently labeled data during the training process to elaborate a
well-generalizing model. In addition, there is a great need for an automated
solution that works with any nationally diversified sign language. Although
there are language-agnostic transcription systems, such as the Hamburg Sign
Language Notation System (HamNoSys) that describe the signer's initial position
and body movement instead of the glosses' meanings, there are still issues with
providing accurate and reliable labels for every real-world use case. In this
context, the industry relies heavily on manual attribution and labeling of the
available video data. In this work, we tackle this issue and thoroughly analyze
the HamNoSys labels provided by various maintainers of open sign language
corpora in five sign languages, in order to examine the challenges encountered
in labeling video data. We also investigate the consistency and objectivity of
HamNoSys-based labels for the purpose of training machine learning models. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the limitations of the current labeling
methods and pave the way for future research on developing more accurate and
efficient solutions for sign language recognition.

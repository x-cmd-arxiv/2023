  from Inter-robot Accusations",,,,,"cs.RO cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Weighted-Mean Subsequence Reduced (W-MSR) algorithm, the state-of-the-art
method for Byzantine-resilient design of decentralized multi-robot systems, is
based on discarding outliers received over Linear Consensus Protocol (LCP).
Although W-MSR provides well-understood theoretical guarantees relating robust
network connectivity to the convergence of the underlying consensus, the method
comes with several limitations preventing its use at scale: (1) the number of
Byzantine robots, F, to tolerate should be known a priori, (2) the requirement
that each robot maintains 2F+1 neighbors is impractical for large F, (3)
information propagation is hindered by the requirement that F+1 robots
independently make local measurements of the consensus property in order for
the swarm's decision to change, and (4) W-MSR is specific to LCP and does not
generalize to applications not implemented over LCP. In this work, we propose a
Decentralized Blocklist Protocol (DBP) based on inter-robot accusations.
Accusations are made on the basis of locally-made observations of misbehavior,
and once shared by cooperative robots across the network are used as input to a
graph matching algorithm that computes a blocklist. DBP generalizes to
applications not implemented via LCP, is adaptive to the number of Byzantine
robots, and allows for fast information propagation through the multi-robot
system while simultaneously reducing the required network connectivity relative
to W-MSR. On LCP-type applications, DBP reduces the worst-case connectivity
requirement of W-MSR from (2F+1)-connected to (F+1)-connected and the number of
cooperative observers required to propagate new information from F+1 to just 1
observer. We demonstrate empirically that our approach to Byzantine resilience
scales to hundreds of robots on cooperative target tracking, time
synchronization, and localization case studies.

  Quantum Computer","11 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  NP-hard problems are not believed to be exactly solvable through general
polynomial time algorithms. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms to address such
combinatorial problems have been of great interest in the past few years. Such
algorithms are heuristic in nature and aim to obtain an approximate solution.
Significant improvements in computational time and/or the ability to treat
large problems are some of the principal promises of quantum computing in this
regard. The hardware, however, is still in its infancy and the current Noisy
Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are not able to optimize
industrially relevant problems. Moreover, the storage of qubits and
introduction of entanglement require extreme physical conditions. An issue with
quantum optimization algorithms such as QAOA is that they scale linearly with
problem size. In this paper, we build upon a proprietary methodology which
scales logarithmically with problem size - opening an avenue for treating
optimization problems of unprecedented scale on gate-based quantum computers.
In order to test the performance of the algorithm, we first find a way to apply
it to a handful of NP-hard problems: Maximum Cut, Minimum Partition, Maximum
Clique, Maximum Weighted Independent Set. Subsequently, these algorithms are
tested on a quantum simulator with graph sizes of over a hundred nodes and on a
real quantum computer up to graph sizes of 256. To our knowledge, these
constitute the largest realistic combinatorial optimization problems ever run
on a NISQ device, overcoming previous problem sizes by almost tenfold.

Because of the species' weakness, the probability of individuals conquering
territory in the cyclic spatial game is low. Running stochastic simulations, we
study the role of unevenness in the rock-paper-scissors game in spatial
patterns and population dynamics, considering diverse models where the weak
species are in different positions in the cyclic game order. Studying systems
with five and seven species, we discover that the individuals' spatial
organisation arising from the pattern formation process determines the
stability of the cyclic game with multiple weak species. Our outcomes show that
the presence of species unbalances the spatial distribution of organisms of the
same species bringing consequences on territorial dominance, with the
predominant species being determined by the position in the cyclic game order.
Our simulations elucidate that, in general, the further apart the regions
inhabited by different weak species are, the less the coexistence between the
species is jeopardised. We show that if multiple weak species occupy adjacent
spatial domains, the unevenness in the cyclic game is reinforced, maximising
the chances of biodiversity loss. Our discoveries may also be helpful to
biologists in comprehending systems where weak species unbalance biodiversity
stability.

fields. Various methods of evaporative self-assembly are of particular
interest. The paper describes a mathematical model of mass transfer in a
droplet drying on a substrate based on the lubrication approximation. The model
takes into account the transfer of a dissolved or suspended substance by a
capillary flow, the diffusion of this substance, the evaporation of liquid, the
formation of solid deposit, the dependence of the viscosity and the vapor flux
density on the admixture concentration. The case with pinning of the
three-phase boundary is considered here. Explicit and implicit
finite-difference schemes have been developed for the model equations. A
modification of the numerical method is proposed, in which splitting by
physical processes, the iterative method of explicit relaxation and Thomas
algorithm are combined. A practical recipe for suppressing sawtooth
oscillations is described using the example of a specific problem. A software
module in C++ has been developed, which can be used for evaporative lithography
problems in the future. With the help of this module, numerical calculations
were carried out, the results of which were compared with the results obtained
in the Maple package. Numerical simulation predicted the case in which the
direction of the capillary flow changes to the opposite over time due to a
change in the sign of the gradient of the vapor flux density. This can lead to
a slowdown in the transfer of the substance to the periphery, which as a result
will contribute to the formation of a more or less uniform precipitation over
the entire contact area of the droplet with the substrate. This observation is
useful for improving methods of annular deposit suppression associated with the
coffee-ring effect and undesirable for some applications, such as inkjet
printing or coating.

this gap on resource-constrained embedded systems, we train and live-adapt
agents on quadrotors built from off-the-shelf hardware. In achieving this we
developed three novel contributions. (i) SwaNNFlight, an open-source firmware
enabling wireless data capture and transfer of agents' observations.
Fine-tuning agents with new data, and receiving and swapping onboard NN
controllers -- all while in flight. We also design SwaNNFlight System (SwaNNFS)
allowing new research in training and live-adapting learning agents on similar

importance of each policy optimization criterion, improving training
performance and variability in learnt behavior. And (iii) anchor critics to
help stabilize the fine-tuning of agents during sim-to-real transfer, online
learning from real data while retaining behavior optimized in simulation. We
train consistently flight-worthy control policies in simulation and deploy them
on real quadrotors. We then achieve live controller adaptation via over-the-air
updates of the onboard control policy from a ground station. Our results
indicate that live adaptation unlocks a near-50\% reduction in power
consumption, attributed to the sim-to-real gap. Finally, we tackle the issues
of catastrophic forgetting and controller instability, showing the
effectiveness of our novel methods.

Aperiodic Order for generating quasicrystals with pure point diffraction.
Linear repetitivity (LR) is a form of ideal regularity of aperiodic patterns.
Recently, Koivusalo and the present author characterised LR for cut and project
sets with convex polytopal windows whose supporting hyperplanes are
commensurate with the lattice, the weak homogeneity property. For such cut and
project sets, LR is equivalent to properties C and D, of low complexity and the
scheme being Diophantine (or `badly approximable') i.e., lattice points in the
total space stay far from the physical space, relative to their norm. We review
then extend these results to non-convex and disconnected polytopal windows, as
well as windows with polytopal partitions producing cut and project sets of
labelled points. Moreover, we obtain a complete characterisation of LR in the
fully general case, where weak homogeneity is not assumed. Here, the
Diophantine property must be replaced with an inhomogeneous analogue.

each from a set of 50 CMR datasets to create a total of 100 models to evaluate

orientations mapped from a diffusion tensor MRI human atlas, (3) fibrosis map
from the LGE-CMR scan, and (4) simulation of local activation time (LAT) and
phase singularity (PS) mapping. We evaluated reproducibility in our pipeline by
comparing agreement in shape of the output meshes, fibrosis distribution in the
LA body, and fibre orientations; simulations outputs were evaluated comparing
total activation times of LAT maps, mean conduction velocity (CV), and
structural similarity index measure (SSIM) of PS maps. Our workflow allows a
single model to be created in 16.72 +/- 12.25 minutes. Results in this abstract
are reported as inter/intra. Shape only differed noticeably with users'
selection of the MV and the length of the PV from the ostia to the distal end;
fibrosis agreement (0.91/0.99 ICC) and fibre orientation agreement (60.63/71.77

difference of the total activation times was 2.02ms/1.37ms. The average of the
mean CV difference was -4.04mm/s / 2.1mm/s. PS maps showed a moderately good
agreement with SSIM of 0.648/0.608. Although we found notable differences in
the models due to user input, our tests show that operator variability was
comparable to that of image resolution or fibre estimation.

generalizing across domains remains elusive. In humans such learning proceeds
via declarative memory formation and is closely associated with consciousness.
Predictive processing has been advanced as a principled Bayesian inference
framework for understanding the cortex as implementing deep generative
perceptual models for both sensory data and action control. However, predictive
processing offers little direct insight into fast compositional learning or the
mystery of consciousness. Here we propose that through implementing online
learning by hierarchical binding of unpredicted inferences, a predictive
processing system may flexibly generalize in novel situations by forming
working memories for perceptions and actions from single examples, which can
become short- and long-term declarative memories retrievable by associative
recall. We argue that the contents of such working memories are unified yet
differentiated, can be maintained by selective attention and are consistent
with observations of masking, postdictive perceptual integration, and other
paradigm cases of consciousness research. We describe how the brain could have
evolved to use perceptual value prediction for reinforcement learning of
complex action policies simultaneously implementing multiple survival and
reproduction strategies. 'Conscious experience' is how such a learning system
perceptually represents its own functioning, suggesting an answer to the meta
problem of consciousness. Our proposal naturally unifies feature binding,
recurrent processing, and predictive processing with global workspace, and, to
a lesser extent, the higher order theories of consciousness.

the ability of calculating accurate wave functions for continuum states of
polycentric systems via the solution of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation,
including both the correlation effects and multi-scattering interference terms,
typically neglected in widely used approaches, such as the Mott theory. Within
this framework, we calculate the purely elastic scattering matrix elements. As
a test case, we apply our scheme to the modelling of electron-water elastic
scattering. The Dirac-Hartree-Fock self-consistent field method is used to
determine the non-spherical molecular potential projected on a functional space
spanned by Gaussian basis set. By adding a number of multi-centric
radially-arranged $s$-type Gaussian functions, whose exponents are
system-dependent and optimized to reproduce the properties of the continuum
electron wave function in different energy regions, we are able to achieve
unprecedented access to the description of the low energy range of the spectrum

dissipation and dephasing phenomena generated by couplings to various

consequences of single-transmon dissipation and dephasing to the many-body

deliberately consider the full Hilbert space including the higher excited

many-body dissipation, and heating/cooling transitions between different
anharmonicity manifolds. Of these, the many-body decoherence -- being
proportional to the squared distance between the many-body Fock states -- gives
the strictest limit for observing effective unitary dynamics. Considering

paper, we study various SSSL techniques using a UAV with predefined waypoints.
A linear least square (LLS) based localization scheme is considered with
enhanced reference selection due to its relatively lower computational
complexity. Five different LLS localization algorithms are proposed and studied
for selecting anchor positions to be used for localization as the UAV navigates
through an area. The performance of each algorithm is measured in two ways: 1)
real-time positioning accuracy during the ongoing UAV flight, and 2) long-term
accuracy measured at the end of the UAV flight. We compare and analyze the
performance of the proposed approaches using computer simulations in terms of

fundamental concepts of modern astronomy. Both constant and variable IMFs
across different environments have been claimed despite a large number of

Galactic stellar populations has been limited by the relatively small number of

depends on both metallicity and stellar age. Specifically, the stellar
population formed at the early time contains fewer low-mass stars compared to
the canonical IMF, independent of stellar metallicities. In present days, on
the other hand, the proportion of low-mass stars increases with stellar
metallicity. The variable abundance of low-mass stars in our Milky Way

is important to develop methods to predict their mechanical response as a
function of the microstructure prior to loading. We develop a coarse-grained
spring network model, which describes the mechanical response of metallic
glasses using an equivalent series network of springs, which can break and
re-form to mimic atomic rearrangements during deformation. To validate the
model, we perform simulations of quasistatic, uniaxial tension of Lennard-Jones
and embedded atom method (EAM) potentials for Cu$_{50}$Zr$_{50}$ metallic
glasses. We consider samples prepared using a wide range of cooling rates and
with different amounts of crystalline order. We show that both the
Lennard-Jones and EAM models possess qualitatively similar stress $\sigma$
versus strain $\gamma$ curves. By specifying five parameters in the spring
network model (ultimate strength, strain at ultimate strength, slopes of
$\sigma(\gamma)$ at $\gamma=0$ and at large strain, and strain at fracture
where $\sigma=0$), we can accurately describe the form of the stress-strain
curves during uniaxial tension for the computational studies of
Cu$_{50}$Zr$_{50}$, as well as recent experimental studies of several Zr-based
metallic glasses. For the computational studies of Cu$_{50}$Zr$_{50}$, we find
that the yield strain distribution is shifted to larger strains for slowly
cooled glasses compared to rapidly cooled glasses. In addition, the average
number of new springs and their rate of formation decreases with decreasing
cooling rate. These effects offset each other at large strains, causing the
stress-strain curve to become independent of the sample preparation protocol in
this regime. In future studies, we will extract the parameters that define the
spring network model directly from atomic rearrangements that occur during

events. The larger radii of these stars at young ages would have put them near
contact at the system's current separation, and we speculate that this system
has undergone dynamical evolution, either through orbital angular momentum loss
or ejection of a third component followed by tidal circularization. While
further observations are needed to fully constrain the orbital and physical
parameters of LP 413-53, this ultra-short-period UCD binary system serves as a

are multiple users, each with an associated multi-armed bandit problem. These
users are grouped into \emph{latent} clusters such that the mean reward vectors
of users within the same cluster are identical. At each round, a user, selected
uniformly at random, pulls an arm and observes a corresponding noisy reward.
The goal of the users is to maximize their cumulative rewards. This problem is
central to practical recommendation systems and has received wide attention of
late \cite{gentile2014online, maillard2014latent}. Now, if each user acts
independently, then they would have to explore each arm independently and a
regret of $\Omega(\sqrt{\mathsf{MNT}})$ is unavoidable, where $\mathsf{M},
\mathsf{N}$ are the number of arms and users, respectively. Instead, we propose
LATTICE (Latent bAndiTs via maTrIx ComplEtion) which allows exploitation of the
latent cluster structure to provide the minimax optimal regret of
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{(\mathsf{M}+\mathsf{N})\mathsf{T}})$, when the number of
clusters is $\widetilde{O}(1)$. This is the first algorithm to guarantee such
strong regret bound. LATTICE is based on a careful exploitation of arm
information within a cluster while simultaneously clustering users.
Furthermore, it is computationally efficient and requires only
$O(\log{\mathsf{T}})$ calls to an offline matrix completion oracle across all
$\mathsf{T}$ rounds.

this study represents a major step forward in connecting aluminosilicate glass

processes and applications, including sustainable cements and aluminosilicate
glasses. In an effort to probe these interactions, here we have calculated the
pair-wise interaction energies (i.e., binding energies) between aluminosilicate
dimer/trimer and 17 different metal cations using a density functional theory
(DFT) approach. Analysis of the DFT-optimized structural representations for
the clusters (dimer/trimer + cation) shows that their structural attributes
(e.g., interatomic distances) are generally consistent with literature
observations on aluminosilicate glasses. The DFT-derived binding energies are
seen to vary considerably depending on the type of cations (i.e., charge and
ionic radii) and aluminosilicate species (i.e., dimer or trimer). A survey of
the literature reveals that the difference in the calculated binding energies
between different cations can be used to explain many literature observations
on the impact of cations on materials properties (e.g., glass corrosion,
mineral dissolution, and ionic transport). Analysis of all the DFT-derived
binding energies reveals that the correlation between these energy values and
the ionic potential and field strength of the cations are well captured by 2nd
order polynomial functions (R2 values of 0.99-1.00 are achieved for
regressions). Given that the ionic potential and field strength of a given
metal cation can be readily estimated using well-tabulated ionic radii
available in the literature, these simple polynomial functions would enable
rapid estimation of the binding energies of a much wider range of cations with
the aluminosilicate dimer/trimer, providing guidance on the design and
optimization of sustainable cements and aluminosilicate glasses and their
associated applications.

one-body observables, and we consider one- and two-body entanglement to assess
under what conditions the many-body and mean-field predictions are likely to
disagree. Except for a special category of prototypical initial conditions, we
find that the typically employed mean-field approximation is insufficient to
capture the evolution of one-body operators in the systems we consider. We also
observe a loss of coherence in one- and two-body trace-reduced subsystems which

essential for a better society. As the foundational axiom of social mechanisms,
fairness consists of multiple facets. Although the machine learning (ML)

especially in discrimination issues, an emerging body of literature addresses
another facet -- monotonicity. Based on domain expertise, monotonicity plays a
vital role in numerous fairness-related areas, where violations could misguide
human decisions and lead to disastrous consequences. In this paper, we first
systematically evaluate the significance of applying monotonic neural additive
models (MNAMs), which use a fairness-aware ML algorithm to enforce both
individual and pairwise monotonicity principles, for the fairness of AI ethics

simulation, and extensive empirical analysis, that considering monotonicity
axioms is essential in all areas of fairness, including criminology, education,
health care, and finance. Our research contributes to the interdisciplinary
research at the interface of AI ethics, explainable AI (XAI), and
human-computer interactions (HCIs). By evidencing the catastrophic consequences
if monotonicity is not met, we address the significance of monotonicity
requirements in AI applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MNAMs are an
effective fairness-aware ML approach by imposing monotonicity restrictions

biomarkers by Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) may improve the
exploitation of the plasmonic enhancement. This work, thus, critically
investigates the role of probe labelling configuration on the performance of
SERS based bioassays for miRNA quantitation. To this aim, highly efficient SERS
substrates based on Ag-decorated porous silicon/PDMS membranes are
functionalized according to two different bioassays relying on a one-step or
two-step hybridization of the target miRNA with oligonucleotide probes. The
detection configuration is varied, exploring the impact of the position of the
Raman reporter along the oligo sequence and of the reporter identity on
bioassay sensitivity. In the high miRNA concentration regime(100-10 nM), a
significantly increased SERS intensity is detected when the reporters are
located closer to the plasmonic surface compared to farther probe labelling
positions. Counterintuitively, a levelling-off of the SERS intensity from the
two configuration is instead recorded at low miRNA concentration. Such effect
is explained by an increased contribution of Raman hot spot to the whole SERS
signal, as confirmed by simulations of the electric near field for a simplified
model of the Ag nanostructures. The beneficial effect of reducing the
reporter-to-surface distance is however partially retained for the two-step
hybridization assay thanks to the less sterically hindered environment in which
the second hybridization occurs. The study thus demonstrates that the limit of
detection of the assay can be lowered by tuning the probe labelling position,
but sheds at the same time light on the complexity of the bionanointerfaces in
SERS and on the multiple factors affecting bioassay sensitivity.

estimating treatment effects using observational data, and multiple imputation
is popular for handling covariate missingness. However, how to appropriately
use multiple imputation for propensity score analysis is not completely clear.
This paper aims to bring clarity on the consistency (or lack thereof) of
methods that have been proposed, focusing on the within approach (where the
effect is estimated separately in each imputed dataset and then the multiple
estimates are combined) and the across approach (where typically propensity
scores are averaged across imputed datasets before being used for effect
estimation). We show that the within method is valid and can be used with any
causal effect estimator that is consistent in the full-data setting. Existing
across methods are inconsistent, but a different across method that averages
the inverse probability weights across imputed datasets is consistent for
propensity score weighting. We also comment on methods that rely on imputing a
function of the missing covariate rather than the covariate itself, including
imputation of the propensity score and of the probability weight. Based on
consistency results and practical flexibility, we recommend generally using the
standard within method. Throughout, we provide intuition to make the results
meaningful to the broad audience of applied researchers.

architecture provably obeys the stability condition and also provide empirical
verification. For generalization on unseen tasks, we identify an inductive bias
phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task
complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner. Finally,
we provide numerical evaluations that (1) demonstrate transformers can indeed

suppressed FCNC processes, such as $t\to q(h,V)$ with $V=\gamma,Z,g$, $h\to

induced-FCNCs are all from quantum loops, we consider the scotogenic mechanism,
where a $Z_2$ symmetry is introduced and only new particles carry an odd $Z_2$
parity. With the extension of the SM to include an inert Higgs doublet, an

possible to generate intriguing patterns, such as persistent breathing chimera
states. Thereafter, we analyze the geometric properties of the mean-field

Ly$\alpha$ associations. Their spectra are indicative of very highly ionized
and metal poor gas, with line ratios (O32 $=17.84$ and Ne3O2 $=0.89$) and
metallicity ($12+\log{[\rm{O/H}]}=7.84$) that are rarely seen at lower
redshifts. We find that the most extreme spectral properties are found in the
six $z\gtrsim7$ Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies in the sample. Each have hard
ionizing spectra indicating that their visibility is likely enhanced by
efficient ionizing photon production. Ly$\alpha$ velocity offsets are found to
be very large ($\gtrsim300$ km s$^{-1}$), likely also contributing to their
detectability. We find that Ly$\alpha$ in $z\gtrsim7$ galaxies is $6-12\times$
weaker than in lower redshift samples with matched rest-frame optical spectral
properties. If the bubbles around the Ly$\alpha$ emitters are relatively small
($\lesssim0.5-1$ pMpc), we may expect such significant attenuation of
Ly$\alpha$ in these ionized regions. We discuss several other effects that may
contribute to weaker Ly$\alpha$ emission at $z\gtrsim7$. Deep spectroscopy of
fainter galaxies in the vicinity of the Ly$\alpha$ emitters will better
characterize the physical scale of the ionized bubbles in this field.

crystal-quality metal thin films of controlled thickness down to a few
nanometers. In particular, these materials exhibit a highly nonlinear response
to optical fields owing to the induced ultrafast electron dynamics, which is
however poorly understood on such mesoscopic length scales. Here, we reveal a
new mechanism that controls the nonlinear optical response of thin metallic
films, dominated by ultrafast electronic heat transport when the thickness is
sufficiently small. By experimentally and theoretically studying electronic
transport in such materials, we explain the observed temporal evolution of
photoluminescence in pump-probe measurements that we report for crystalline
gold flakes. Incorporating a first-principles description of the electronic
band structures, we model electronic transport and find that ultrafast thermal
dynamics plays a pivotal role in determining the strength and time-dependent
characteristics of the nonlinear photoluminescence signal, which is largely
influenced by the distribution of hot electrons and holes, subject to diffusion
across the film as well as relaxation to lattice modes. Our findings introduce
conceptually novel elements triggering the nonlinear optical response of
nanoscale materials while suggesting additional ways to control and leverage
hot carrier distributions in metallic films.

zero-shot and few-shot performance. However, recent work finds that models can
perform surprisingly well when given intentionally irrelevant or misleading
prompts. Such results may be interpreted as evidence that model behavior is not
""human like"". In this study, we challenge a central assumption in such work:
that humans would perform badly when given pathological instructions. We find
that humans are able to reliably ignore irrelevant instructions and thus, like
models, perform well on the underlying task despite an apparent lack of signal
regarding the task they are being asked to do. However, when given deliberately
misleading instructions, humans follow the instructions faithfully, whereas
models do not. Thus, our conclusion is mixed with respect to prior work. We
argue against the earlier claim that high performance with irrelevant prompts
constitutes evidence against models' instruction understanding, but we
reinforce the claim that models' failure to follow misleading instructions
raises concerns. More broadly, we caution that future research should not
idealize human behaviors as a monolith and should not train or evaluate models
to mimic assumptions about these behaviors without first validating humans'
behaviors empirically.

rigorous operator algebraic theory of dynamics in locally interacting systems
in any dimension is provided here in terms of time-dependent Gibbs ensembles.
The theory explains dynamics in closed, open and time-dependent systems and
time-dependent Gibbs ensembles unify wide classes of quantum non-ergodic and
ergodic systems. The theory is applied to quantum many-body scars, continuous,
discrete and dissipative time crystals, Hilbert space fragmentation, lattice
gauge theories, and disorder-free localization, among other cases. Novel
pseudo-local classes of operators are introduced in the process:
projected-local, which are local only for some states, crypto-local, whose
locality is not manifest in terms of any finite number of local densities and
transient ones, that dictate finite-time relaxation dynamics. An immediate
corollary is proving saturation of the Mazur bound for the Drude weight. This
proven theory is intuitively the rigorous algebraic counterpart of the weak
eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and has deep implications for
thermodynamics: quantum many-body systems 'out-of-equilibrium' are actually
always in a time-dependent equilibrium state for any natural initial state. The
work opens the possibility of designing novel out-of-equilibrium phases, with

nanoparticles surrounded by a repulsive surfactant layer. When subjected to an
external magnetic field the ferrofluid acquires a macroscopic magnetization
density which leads to magnetic behavior that is intricately coupled to the
ambient fluid dynamics. Ferrofluids share several features with the chiral
active fluids composed of unidirectionally spinning hematite cubes, which have
been shown to possess a 2D non-dissipative odd viscosity term (Nature Physics,
15, 1188-1194(2019)). In standard ferrofluid dynamics, 3D versions of parity
breaking terms are not commonly observed, partly because of the small size of
the magnetic particles. In this work, we investigate if there are unique
mechanisms in ferrofluids that can lead to a 3D odd viscosity term. Our results
show that coupling the fluid vorticity ($\vec{\omega}$) to the magnetization
($\vec{M}$) with a term proportional to $\vec{\omega}\cdot\vec{M}$ leads to
parity breaking terms in ferrofluid hydrodynamics, and results in a three
dimensional odd viscosity term when the magnetization is relaxed to the
direction of a uniform and static applied field. Hele-Shaw cells are commonly
used devices to investigate ferrofluids and we demonstrate that this coupling
reproduces the parity odd generalization of Darcy's Law discussed in a recent
work (Phys. Rev. Fluids 7, 114201 (2022)). A potential experimental setup is
discussed which may reveal the presence of this coupling in a ferrofluid

ensemble of codes generated by the Brownian SYK model, where the parameter
quantifies the encoding complexity. The robustness of error correction by a
quantum code is upper bounded by the ""mutual purity"" of a certain entangled
state between the code subspace and environment in the isometric extension of
the error channel, where the mutual purity of a density matrix $\rho_{AB}$ is
the difference $\mathcal{F}_\rho (A:B) \equiv \mathrm{Tr}\;\rho_{AB}^2 -
\mathrm{Tr}\;\rho_A^2\;\mathrm{Tr}\;\rho_B^2$. We show that when the encoding
complexity is small, the mutual purity is $O(1)$ for the erasure of a small
number of qubits (i.e., the encoding is fragile). However, this quantity decays
exponentially, becoming $O(1/N)$ for $O(\log N)$ encoding complexity. Further,
at polynomial encoding complexity, the mutual purity saturates to a plateau of
$O(e^{-N})$. We also find a hierarchy of complexity scales associated to a
tower of subleading contributions to the mutual purity that quantitatively, but
not qualitatively, adjust our error correction bound as encoding complexity
increases. In the AdS/CFT context, our results suggest that any portion of the
entanglement wedge of a general boundary subregion $A$ with sufficiently high
encoding complexity is robustly protected against low-rank errors acting on $A$
with no prior access to the encoding map. From the bulk point of view, we
expect such bulk degrees of freedom to be causally inaccessible from the region

benchmarking protocols for them. In our previous paper (arXiv: 2210.04330), we
developed metrological protocols to measure the reduced Choi matrix i.e., the
completely positive (CP) maps induced on a subset S of the qubits, by the
multi-qubit gate. Here, we show a set of classically verifiable properties that
the Choi matrix satisfies if it is a reduction of a multi-qubit unitary and use
them to develop benchmarks. We identify three types of errors that affect the
implementation of a multi-qubit unitary, based on their mathematical properties
and physical origin. Although a target multi-qubit gate is a unitary operator,
errors turn it into a general completely positive (CP) map. Errors due to
coupling to a thermal bath result in the multi-qubit gate being CP-divisible
(Markovian), deviating from a unitary. The reduced Choi matrix of a multi-qubit
gate has a property known as double stochasticity, which is violated in the
presence of Markovian errors. We construct a benchmark using
double-stochasticity violation and show that it is sensitive to coupling to any
thermal bath at a finite temperature. Further, errors due to shot-to-shot
fluctuations result in a non-markovian, i.e., CP-indivisible quantum process.
We prove a new property, which we call the \rank property of the reduced Choi
matrix, the violation of which implies a CP-indivisible error. A third category
of errors comes from systematics in the implementation of a multi-qubit gate,
resulting in no deviation from unitarity. We refer to this as unitary errors.
This corresponds to the most challenging type of error to benchmark. We develop
a partial-benchmarking protocol for such errors using symmetries of the
multi-qubit gate being applied.

classify the satellites by whether their possible orbits are consistent with

orbits to those within the plane. On the other hand, disregarding the 5
off-plane satellites found to be inconsistent with CASP membership enhances the

single ultralight field. ULDM halos have a characteristic granular structure
that increases stellar velocity dispersion and can be used as observational
constraints on ULDM models. In multifield simulations, we find that inside a
halo the amplitude of the total density fluctuations decreases as $1/\sqrt{N}$
and that the fields do not become significantly correlated over cosmological
timescales. Smoother halos heat stellar orbits less efficiently, reducing the
velocity dispersion relative to the single field case and thus weakening the
observational constraints on the field mass. Analytically, we show that for $N$
equal-mass fields with mass $m$ the ULDM contribution to the stellar velocity

accounts for the majority of observations by introducing two dark components,
dark energy and dark matter, which represent $\sim$95% of the mass-energy
budget of the Universe. Nevertheless, the $\Lambda$CDM model faces important
challenges on the scale of galaxies. For example, some very tight relations
between the properties of dark and baryonic matters in disk galaxies, such as
the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), the mass discrepancy-acceleration
relation (MDAR), and the radial acceleration relation (RAR), which see the
emergence of the acceleration scale $a_0 \simeq 1.2 \times 10^{-10}$ m
s$^{-2}$, cannot be intuitively explained by the CDM paradigm, where cosmic
structures form through a stochastic merging process. An even more outstanding
coincidence is due to the fact that the acceleration scale $a_0$, emerging from
galaxy dynamics, also seems to be related to the cosmological constant
$\Lambda$. Another challenge is provided by dwarf galaxies, which are darker
than what is expected in their innermost regions. These pieces of evidence can
be more naturally explained, or sometimes even predicted, by modified theories
of gravity, that do not introduce any dark fluid. I illustrate possible
solutions to these problems with the modified theory of gravity MOND, which
departs from Newtonian gravity for accelerations smaller than $a_0$, and with
Refracted Gravity, a novel classical theory of gravity introduced in 2016,

properly treat high specific energy wind components and demonstrate them using
idealised non-cosmological simulations of a galaxy with a realistic CGM, using
the Arepo code. Hot, fast gas phases with low mass loadings are predicted to
dominate the energy content of multiphase outflows. In order to treat the huge
dynamic range of spatial scales involved in cosmological galaxy formation at
feasible computational expense, cosmological volume simulations typically
employ a Lagrangian code or else use adaptive mesh refinement with a
quasi-Lagrangian refinement strategy. However, it is difficult to inject a high
specific energy wind in a Lagrangian scheme without incurring artificial
burstiness. Additionally, the low densities inherent to this type of flow
result in poor spatial resolution. Arkenstone addresses these issues with a
novel scheme for coupling energy into the ISM/CGM transition region which also
provides the necessary level of refinement at the base of the wind. In the
absence of our improvements, we show that poor spatial resolution near the
sonic point of a hot, fast outflow leads to an underestimation of gas
acceleration as the wind propagates. We explore the different mechanisms by
which low and high specific energy winds can regulate the SFR of galaxies. In

frameworks of topological quantum field theories. We show under the

property; that is, we derive it as a theorem. Starting from a single wave
function on a topologically-trivial region satisfying the entanglement
bootstrap axioms, we can construct states on closed manifolds. The crucial
technique is to immerse the punctured manifold into the topologically trivial
region and then heal the puncture. This is analogous to Kirby's torus trick. We
then analyze a special class of such manifolds, which we call pairing
manifolds. For each pairing manifold, which pairs two classes of excitations,
we identify an analog of the topological S-matrix. This pairing matrix is
unitary, which implies remote detectability between two classes of excitations.
These matrices are in general not associated with the mapping class group of
the manifold. As a by-product, we can count excitation types (e.g., graph
excitations in 3+1d). The pairing phenomenon occurs in many physical contexts,
including systems in different dimensions, with or without gapped boundaries.

the luminous component of the Universe, galaxies, relates to the growth of
structure which is dominated by the gravitational collapse of dark matter
haloes. The stellar-to-halo mass relation probes how galaxies occupy dark
matter haloes and what that entails for their star formation history. We
deliver the first self-consistent empirical model that can place constraints on
the stellar-to-halo mass relation down to log stellar mass
$\log_{10}(m^*/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) \leq 5.0$ by fitting our model directly to
Local Group dwarf data. This is accomplished by penalising galaxy growth in
late-forming, low-mass haloes by mimicking the effects of reionization. This
process serves to regulate the number density of galaxies by altering the
scatter in halo peak mass $M^{\mathrm{peak}}_{h}$ at fixed stellar mass,
creating a tighter scatter than would otherwise exist without a high-$z$
quenching mechanism. Our results indicate that the previously established
double-power law stellar-to-halo mass relation can be extended to include
galaxies with
$\log_{10}(M^{\mathrm{peak}}_{\mathrm{h}}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})\gtrsim 10.0$.
Furthermore, we show that haloes with
$\log_{10}(M^{\mathrm{peak}}_{\mathrm{h}}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot})\lesssim 9.3$ by
$z=4$ are unlikely to host a galaxy with $\log_{10}(m^*/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) >

unified view of these hypotheses, and we hope provides additional motivation
for studying some of the lesser-known hypotheses that appear here.
  Additionally, because several classical forms of AC are formulated in terms
of cardinals, we develop a theory of polynomial-time cardinality. Nerode &
Remmel (Contemp. Math. 106, 1990 and Springer Lec. Notes Math. 1432, 1990)
developed a related theory, but restricted to unary sets. Downey (Math. Reviews

interesting connections to more standard complexity questions, and we
illustrate some of those connections here.
  The connections between AC, cardinality, and complexity questions also allow

(AGNs) at $z \gtrsim 5$ represents a key constraint to understand their
contribution to the ionizing photon budget necessary to trigger the last phase
transition in the Universe, i.e. the epoch of Reionization. Recent searches for
bright high-z AGNs suggest that the space densities of this population at $z>4$
has to be revised upwards, and sparks new questions about their evolutionary
paths. Gas accretion is the key physical mechanism to understand both the
distribution of luminous sources and the growth of central Super-Massive Black
Holes (SMBHs). In this work, we model the high-z AGN-LF assuming that high-z
luminous AGN shine at their Eddington limit: we derive the expected evolution
as a function of the ``duty-cycle'' ($f_{\rm dc}$), i.e. the fraction of
life-time that a given SMBH spends accreting at the Eddington rate. Our results
show that intermediate values ($f_{\rm dc} \simeq 0.1$) predict the best
agreement with the ionizing background and photoionization rate, but do not
provide enough ionizing photons to account for the observed evolution of the
hydrogen neutral fraction. Smaller values ($f_{\rm
  dc} \lesssim 0.05$) are required for AGNs to be the dominant population
responsible for Hydrogen reionization in the Early Universe. We then show that
this low-$f_{\rm dc}$ evolution can be reconciled with the current constraints
on Helium reionization, although it implies a relatively large number of
inactive SMBHs at $z\gtrsim5$, in tension with SMBH growth models based on
heavy seeding.

powerful way to probe both the bias function for GRB progenitors, and the
chemical inhomogeneities across star forming regions. In this study, we predict
the relationship between Zabs and Zem using three different hydrodynamical

while the qualitative shape of the curve relating emission versus absorption

the host galaxy of GRB121024A for which both Zabs and Zem have been measured,

most-realistic internal metallicity distributions within star-forming galaxies

IR to X-ray spectral index is measured and compared to the X-ray spectral index
fitted separately. On some dates in which the jet dominates the IR emission,
the X-ray power law and the IR to X-ray power law spectral indices are both in
the range alpha = -0.7 +/- 0.2 (where F_nu ~ nu^alpha), i.e. photon index,
Gamma = 1.7 +/- 0.2. This suggests they could be the same power law with the
same origin, or that this is a coincidence. On other dates in the hard state,
alpha_{IR-X} < alpha_{X}, ruling out a common origin. It is likely that
Comptonization dominates on most dates, as expected. However, the X-ray power
law never appears to be fainter than the jet power law extrapolated from IR to
X-ray, implying that the jet contribution imposes a lower limit to the X-ray
flux. If confirmed, this would imply the cooling break in the synchrotron
spectrum probably resides at X-ray or higher energies. It is suggested that
X-ray spectral fitting should include an extra power law with a break (ideally

this, we combine theoretical models of PAH emission features as they respond to
varying interstellar radiation fields, grain size distributions, and ionization
states with a new on-the-fly model for dust evolution in hydrodynamic galaxy
simulations. We apply these models to 3 idealized arepo galaxy evolution
simulations within the smuggle physics framework. We use these simulations to
develop numerical experiments investigating the buildup of PAH masses and
luminosities in galaxies in idealized analogs of the Milky Way, a dwarf galaxy,
and starburst disk. Our main results follow. Galaxies with high specific star
formation rates have increased feedback energy per unit mass, and are able to
efficiently shatter dust grains, driving up the fraction of ultra small grains.
At the same time, in our model large radiation fields per unit gas density
convert aliphatic grains into aromatics. The fraction of dust grains in the
form of PAHs (q_PAH) can be understood as a consequence of these processes, and
in our model PAHs form primarily from interstellar processing (shattering) of
larger grains rather than from the growth of smaller grains. We find that the
hardness of the radiation field plays a larger role than variations in the
grain size distribution in setting the total integrated PAH luminosities,
though cosmological simulations are necessary to fully investigate the complex
interplay of processes that drive PAH band luminosities in galaxies. Finally,
we highlight feature PAH strength variations, cautioning against the usage of
emission templates with constant feature strength ratios.

Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks lack the ability to explicitly
accommodate policy heterogeneity, and typically constrain agents to share
neural network parameters. This enforced homogeneity limits application in
cases where the tasks benefit from heterogeneous behaviors. In this paper, we
crystallize the role of heterogeneity in MARL policies. Towards this end, we
introduce Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network Proximal Policy Optimization
(HetGPPO), a paradigm for training heterogeneous MARL policies that leverages a
Graph Neural Network for differentiable inter-agent communication. HetGPPO
allows communicating agents to learn heterogeneous behaviors while enabling
fully decentralized training in partially observable environments. We
complement this with a taxonomical overview that exposes more heterogeneity
classes than previously identified. To motivate the need for our model, we
present a characterization of techniques that homogeneous models can leverage
to emulate heterogeneous behavior, and show how this ""apparent heterogeneity""
is brittle in real-world conditions. Through simulations and real-world
experiments, we show that: (i) when homogeneous methods fail due to strong
heterogeneous requirements, HetGPPO succeeds, and, (ii) when homogeneous
methods are able to learn apparently heterogeneous behaviors, HetGPPO achieves
higher resilience to both training and deployment noise.

corresponds to between 3 and 7 observations per source, probing variability
timescales between a few days and $\sim 20$~yr. All sources have at least one
\nustar observation, ensuring high-energy coverage, which allows us to
disentangle the line-of-sight and reflection components in the X-ray spectra.
For each source, we model all available spectra simultaneously, using the
physical torus models \myt, \bor, and \uxc. The simultaneous fitting, along
with the high-energy coverage, allows us to place tight constraints on torus
parameters such as the torus covering factor, inclination angle, and average
column density. We also estimate the line-of-sight column density ($N_{\rm H}$)
for each individual observation. Within the 12 sources, we detect clear
line-of-sight $N_{\rm H}$ variability in 5, non-variability in 5, and for 2 of
them it is not possible to fully disentangle intrinsic-luminosity and $N_{\rm
H}$ variability. We observe large differences between the average values of
line-of-sight $N_{\rm H}$ (or $N_{\rm H}$ of the obscurer) and the average
$N_{\rm H}$ of the torus (or $N_{\rm H}$ of the reflector), for each source, by
a factor between $\sim2$ to $>100$. This behavior, which suggests a physical
disconnect between the absorber and the reflector, is more extreme in sources
that present $N_{\rm H}$ variability. $N_{\rm H}$-variable AGN also tend to
present larger obscuration and broader cloud distributions than their
non-variable counterparts. We observe that large changes in obscuration only
occur at long timescales, and use this to place tentative lower limits on torus
cloud sizes.

with the development of ferromagnetic interaction between itinerant Co moments,

among Nd-4f and Co-3d moments, which is antiferromagnetic in nature. Detailed
studies of temperature-dependent dc magnetic susceptibility, field dependence
of isothermal magnetization, non-equilibrium dynamical behavior, viz. magnetic
relaxation, aging effect, magnetic-memory effect, and temperature dependence of
heat capacity, along with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, suggest
that the ground state is magnetically frustrated spin-glass in nature, having
competing magnetic interactions of equivalent energies. DFT results further
reveal that the 3d/5d-conduction carriers are blocked in the system and act as
a barrier for the 4f-4f RKKY interactions, resulting in spin-frustration.
Presence of vacancy defects in the crystal are also conducive to the
spin-frustration. This is an unique mechanism of magnetic frustration, not

measure of quantum correlations within mixed states, can exhibit log scaling or
area law based on the RG flow. When the channel corresponds to a marginal
perturbation, the coefficient of the log scaling can change continuously with
decoherence strength. We illustrate all these possibilities for the critical

from multi-dimensional abuse spanning prolonged time periods, different

This research outlines three indicators of multidimensional abuse, explores how

electric vehicles (BEVs), where one or more charging sessions are required to
reach the intended destination. We consider the availability and performance of
the charging stations to be unknown and stochastic, and develop a combinatorial
semi-bandit framework for exploring the road network to learn the parameters of
the queue time and charging power distributions. Within this framework, we
first outline a pre-processing for the road network graph to handle the
constrained combinatorial optimization problem in an efficient way. Then, for
the pre-processed graph, we use a Bayesian approach to model the stochastic
edge weights, utilizing conjugate priors for the one-parameter exponential and
two-parameter gamma distributions, the latter of which is novel to multi-armed
bandit literature. Finally, we apply combinatorial versions of Thompson
Sampling, BayesUCB and Epsilon-greedy to the problem. We demonstrate the
performance of our framework on long-distance navigation problem instances in
country-sized road networks, with simulation experiments in Norway, Sweden and
Finland.

  inter-factor correlations",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Regression factor score predictors have the maximum factor score determinacy,
i.e., the maximum correlation with the corresponding factor, but they do not
have the same inter-correlations as the factors. As it might be useful to
compute factor score predictors that have the same inter-correlations as the
factors, correlation-preserving factor score predictors have been proposed.
However, correlation-preserving factor score predictors have smaller
correlations with the corresponding factors (factor score determinacy) than
regression factor score predictors. Thus, higher factor score determinacy goes
along with bias of the inter-correlations and unbiased inter-correlations go
along with lower factor score determinacy. The aim of the present study was
therefore to investigate the size of the trade-off between factor score
determinacy and bias of inter-correlations by means of a simulation study. It
turns out that under several conditions very small gains of factor score
determinacy of the regression factor score predictor go along with a large bias
of inter-correlations. Instead of using the regression factor score predictor
by default, it is proposed to check whether substantial bias of
inter-correlations can be avoided without substantial loss of factor score
determinacy by using a correlation-preserving factor score predictor. A syntax
that allows to compute correlation-preserving factor score predictors from
regression factor score predictors and to compare factor score determinacy and
inter-correlations of the factor score predictors is given in the Appendix.

devoted to understanding and supporting the volunteer moderators' workload,
little is known about their practice of handling user appeals. Through a
collaborative and iterative design process with Reddit moderators, we found
that moderators spend considerable effort in investigating user ban appeals and
desired to directly engage with users and retain their agency over each
decision. To fulfill their needs, we designed and built AppealMod, a system
that asks users to put more effort in their appeals, by providing additional
information, before their appeals are reviewed by human moderators. In addition
to giving moderators more information, we expected the friction in the appeal
process would lead to a selection effect among users, with many insincere and
toxic appeals being abandoned before getting any attention from human
moderators. To evaluate our system, we conducted a field experiment in a Reddit
community of over 29 million users that lasted for four months. As a result of
the selection effect, moderators viewed only 30\% of initial appeals and less
than 10\% of the toxically worded appeals; yet they granted roughly the same
number of appeals. Overall, our system is effective at reducing moderator
workload and minimizing their exposure to toxic content while honoring their

nonparametric regression estimator. Nonetheless, in the presence of a large
data set with size $n\gg 1,$ the KRR estimator has the drawback to require an
intensive computational load. Recently, scalable KRR approaches have been
proposed with the aims to reduce the computational complexity of the KRR, while
maintaining its superb convergence rate. In this work, we study a new scalable
KRR based
  approach for nonparametric regression. Our truncated kernel ridge regression
(TKRR) approach is simple. It is based on substituting the full $n\times n$
random kernel or Gram matrix $B_n,$ associated with a Mercer's kernel $\mathbb
K,$ by its main $n\times N$ sub-matrix $A_N,$ where usually $N \ll n.$ Also, we
show that the TKRR works with $d-$dimensional random sampling data following an
unknown probability law. To do so, we give a spectral analysis for the compact
kernel integral operator, associated with a probability measure, different from
its usual probability measure. This decay estimate is then extended to the
decay of the tail of the trace of the associated random Gram matrix. A special
interest is devoted to develop rules for the optimal choices of the involved
truncation order $N$ and the value for regularization parameter $\lambda >0.$
The proposed rules are based on the behavior and the decay rate of the spectrum
of the positive integral operator, associated with the kernel $\mathbb K.$
These optimal values of the parameters ensure that in terms of the empirical
risk error, the TKRR and the full KRR estimators have the same optimal
convergence rate. Finally, we provide the reader with some numerical
simulations that illustrate the performance of our proposed TKRR estimator.

garnered significant attention, largely motivated by the growing catalogue of
observed distorted systems. Previous studies have shown that the evolution of
the warp is crucially regulated by the internal flow fields established by the
undulating geometry. These are typically modelled as laminar horizontal,
shearing flows which oscillate back and forth at approximately the orbital
frequency. However this shearing motion is known to be susceptible to a
hydrodynamic, parametric instability of inertial waves which might modify the
warped dynamics. Whilst the linear growth phase is well understood, the
subsequent nonlinear saturation combined with the self-consistent feedback onto
the warp has not been studied. In this work, we implement a novel numerical
setup using the recent ring model framework of Fairbairn and Ogilvie, within
the Lagrangian code GIZMO. We formally identify several locally growing modes
in the simulation, as predicted by a three-mode coupling analysis of the
instability, and find decent agreement with the theoretical growth rates. We
understand the saturation mechanism as a wave breaking process which suppresses
the growth of shorter wavelength parametric couplings first, whilst allowing
the longest mode to dominate the final quasi-steady, wavelike turbulence. The
Reynolds stresses, transporting energy from the warp to the small scales, can
be effectively modelled using a time-dependent, anisotropic viscous alpha model
which closely captures the amplitude and phase evolution of the warp.
Consequently, this model might help inform future global studies which are
commonplace but typically don't resolve the parametric instability.

dominate the Pbeta emission. Four very young (~3-6 Myr) but lower mass (< 10^4
Msun) clusters are detected in Halpha within a few arcsec of the nuclei, but
produce less than 1% of the line emission. We see little evidence for a
population of massive clusters younger than 100Myr anywhere in Arp 220. From
the masses and ages of the detected clusters, we find that star formation took
place more-or-less continuously starting ~few Gyr ago with a rate between ~3-12
Msun/yr. Approximately 100Myr ago, star formation shut off suddenly everywhere,
except in the nuclear disks. A very recent flicker of weak star formation
produced the four young, low-mass clusters, while the rest of the galaxy
appears to have remained in a post-starburst state. Cluster ages indicate that
the tidal structures on the west side of the galaxy are older than those on the

make use of different tracers of youth. The ABYSS targeting strategy we

young stars to-date. It consists of 8 different types of selection criteria
that take the position on the HR diagram, infrared excess, variability, as well
as the position in phase space in consideration. The resulting catalog of
$\sim$200,000 sources (of which a half are expected to be observed) provides
representative coverage of the young Galaxy, including both nearby diffuse
associations as well as more distant massive complexes, reaching towards the
inner Galaxy and the Galactic center.

neurons to encode different memories. However, when training artificial neural
networks on a set of tasks, typically, no mechanism is employed for selectively
producing anything analogous to these neuronal ensembles. Further, artificial
neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the network's
performance rapidly deteriorates as tasks are learned sequentially. By
contrast, sequential learning is possible for a range of biological organisms.
We introduce Learned Context Dependent Gating (LXDG), a method to flexibly
allocate and recall `artificial neuronal ensembles', using a particular network
structure and a new set of regularization terms. Activities in the hidden
layers of the network are modulated by gates, which are dynamically produced
during training. The gates are outputs of networks themselves, trained with a
sigmoid output activation. The regularization terms we have introduced
correspond to properties exhibited by biological neuronal ensembles. The first
term penalizes low gate sparsity, ensuring that only a specified fraction of
the network is used. The second term ensures that previously learned gates are
recalled when the network is presented with input from previously learned
tasks. Finally, there is a regularization term responsible for ensuring that
new tasks are encoded in gates that are as orthogonal as possible from
previously used ones. We demonstrate the ability of this method to alleviate
catastrophic forgetting on continual learning benchmarks. When the new
regularization terms are included in the model along with Elastic Weight
Consolidation (EWC) it achieves better performance on the benchmark `permuted
MNIST' than with EWC alone. The benchmark `rotated MNIST' demonstrates how
similar tasks recruit similar neurons to the artificial neuronal ensemble.

ab initio-level predictions while reaching large length and time scales often
limited to empirical force fields. Traditionally, neural network potentials
rely on a local description of atomic environments to achieve this scalability.
These local descriptions result in short range models that neglect long range
interactions necessary for processes like dielectric screening in polar
liquids. Several approaches to including long range electrostatic interactions
within neural network models have appeared recently, and here we investigate
the transferability of one such model, the self consistent neural network
(SCFNN), which focuses on learning the physics associated with long range
response. By learning the essential physics, one can expect that such a neural
network model should exhibit at least partial transferability. We illustrate
this transferability by modeling dielectric saturation in a SCFNN model of
water. We show that the SCFNN model can predict non-linear response at high
electric fields, including saturation of the dielectric constant, without
training the model on these high field strengths and the resulting liquid
configurations. We then use these simulations to examine the nuclear and
electronic structure changes underlying dielectric saturation. Our results
suggest that neural network models can exhibit transferability beyond the
linear response regime and make genuine predictions when the relevant physics
is properly learned.

closely with end-users such as factory workers. This growing use of
collaborative robots has been enabled in part due to the availability of
end-user robot programming methods that allow users who are not robot
programmers to teach robots task actions. Programming by Demonstration (PbD) is
one such end-user programming method that enables users to bypass the
complexities of specifying robot motions using programming languages by instead
demonstrating the desired robot behavior. Demonstrations are often provided by
physically guiding the robot through the motions required for a task action in
a process known as kinesthetic teaching. Kinesthetic teaching enables users to
directly demonstrate task behaviors in the robot's configuration space, making
it a popular end-user robot programming method for collaborative robots known
for its low cognitive burden. However, because kinesthetic teaching restricts
the programmer's teaching to motion demonstrations, it fails to leverage
information from other modalities that humans naturally use when providing
physical task demonstrations to one other, such as gaze and speech.
Incorporating multimodal information into the traditional kinesthetic
programming workflow has the potential to enhance robot learning by
highlighting critical aspects of a program, reducing ambiguity, and improving
situational awareness for the robot learner and can provide insight into the
human programmer's intent and difficulties. In this extended abstract, we
describe a preliminary study on multimodal kinesthetic demonstrations and
future directions for using multimodal demonstrations to enhance robot learning

events were best visible in SiIV spectra; they were weak in SJs, occasionally
visible in 1600 A and 304 A AIA images, and invisible in higher temperature AIA

SiIV lines and measured their distance from the limb. A Gaussian model of the
height distribution showed that EEs occur in a narrow (0.9"") height range,
centered at 3.2"" above the continuum limb at 2832.0 A. On the disk, we found
that they occur in network boundaries. Further, we studied the line profiles of
two bright EEs above the limb and one on the disk. We found that what appears
as broad-band emission, is actually a superposition of 2--3 narrow-band
Gaussian components with well-separated line profiles, indicating that material
is expelled towards and/or away from the observer in discrete episodes in time
and in space. The expelled plasma accelerates quickly, reaching line-of-sight
(LOS) velocities up to 90 km/s. Overall, the motion was practically along the
LOS, as the velocity on the plane of sky was small. In some cases tilted
spectra were observed that could be interpreted in terms of rotating motions of
up to 30 km/s. We did not find any strong absorption features in the wing of
the SiIV lines, although in one case a very weak absorption feature was
detected. No motions, indicative of jets, were detected in SJ or AIA images.
Reconnection in an asymmetric magnetic-field geometry, in the middle or near
the top of small loops is a plausible explanation of their observational
characteristics.

K$\alpha$ line photons in the global medium compared with what is observed

aberration affecting the geometry of an image produced by the periphery of an
ophthalmic lens, there are several approaches for analyzing and quantifying
this aberration. Various concepts have been introduced: ordinary distortion,
stationary distortion and central static distortion are associated with a fixed
eye behind the ophthalmic lens, whereas rotatory distortion, peripheral
distortion, lateral static distortion, and dynamic distortion require a
secondary position of gaze behind the lens. Furthermore, concept definitions
vary from one author to another. The goal of this paper is to review the
various concepts, analyze their effects on lens design and determine their
ability to predict the deformation of an image as perceived by the lens wearer.
These entities can be classified within 3 categories: the concepts associated
with an ocular rotation, the concepts resulting from an optical approach, and
the concepts using a perceptual approach. Among the various concepts reviewed,
it appears that the Le Grand-Fry approach for analyzing and displaying
distortion is preferable to others and allows modeling of the different
possible types of distortions affecting the periphery of an ophthalmic lens.

tidal and deformation tensor for random Gaussian cosmic density fields. With
the tidal and deformation tensors, Hessians of the gravitational and velocity
potential, being Gaussian, the corresponding eigenvalue fields are distinctly
non-Gaussian. Following the extension of the Doroshkevich formula for the
joined distribution of eigenvalues to two-dimensional fields, we evaluate the
two- and three-point correlation functions of the eigenvalue fields. In
addition, we assess the number densities of singular points of the eigenvalue
fields and find their corresponding two- and three-point correlation functions.
  The role of tidal forces and the resulting mass element deformation in
shaping the prominent anisotropic wall-like and filamentary components of the
cosmic web has since long been recognized based on the Zel'dovich
approximation. Less well-known is that the weblike spatial pattern is already
recognizable in the primordial tidal and deformation eigenvalue field, even
while the corresponding Gaussian density and the potential field appear merely
as a spatially incoherent and unstructured random field. Furthermore, against
the background of a full phase-space assessment of structure formation in the
Universe, the caustic skeleton theory entails a fully analytical framework for
the nonlinear evolution of the cosmic web. It describes the folding of the dark
matter sheet and the emerging caustic singularities, fully specified by the
deformation eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Finally, tidal tensor eigenvalues are
of central importance, and understanding their distribution is critical in
predicting the resulting rotation and orientation.
  The current study applies to two-dimensional Gaussian random fields and will
be generalized to a three-dimensional analysis in an upcoming study.

a recently developed data-driven learning algorithm of Mori-Zwanzig (MZ)
operators, which is based on a generalized Koopman's description of dynamical
systems. The MZ formalism provides a mathematically exact procedure for
constructing non-Markovian reduced-order models of resolved variables from
high-dimensional dynamical systems, where the effects due to the unresolved
dynamics are captured in the memory kernel and orthogonal dynamics. The
algorithm developed in this work applies Mori's linear projection operator and
an SVD based compression to the selection of the resolved variables
(equivalently, a low rank approximation of the two time covariance matrices).
We show that this MZ decomposition not only identifies the same spatio-temporal
structures found by DMD, but it can also be used to extract spatio-temporal
structures of the hysteresis effects present in the memory kernels. We perform
an analysis of these structures in the context of a laminar-turbulent
boundary-layer transition flow over a flared cone at Mach 6, and show the
dynamical relevance of the memory kernels. Additionally, by including these
memory terms learned in our data-driven MZ approach, we show improvement in
prediction accuracy over DMD at the same level of truncation and at a similar
computational cost. Furthermore, an analysis of the spatio-temporal structures

as for subretinal injection. This procedure requires precise needle insertion
for best treatment outcomes. However, merging robotic systems with iOCT
introduces new challenges. These include, but are not limited to high demands
on data processing rates and dynamic registration of these systems during the
procedure. In this work, we propose a framework for autonomous robotic
navigation for subretinal injection, based on intelligent real-time processing
of iOCT volumes. Our method consists of an instrument pose estimation method,
an online registration between the robotic and the iOCT system, and trajectory
planning tailored for navigation to an injection target. We also introduce
intelligent virtual B-scans, a volume slicing approach for rapid instrument
pose estimation, which is enabled by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our
experiments on ex-vivo porcine eyes demonstrate the precision and repeatability
of the method. Finally, we discuss identified challenges in this work and
suggest potential solutions to further the development of such systems.

nucleon-nucleon interaction. The nuclear structure and expectation values of
physical quantities are drastically changed by the modification. We summarize
such changes and show the effects on the elastic and inelastic scatterings for
the proton and $^{12}$C targets in the microscopic coupled-channel calculation.
Especially, we recently reported the visualization of dineutron correlation in
$^{10}$Be on proton inelastic scattering in [Phys. Rev. C104, 034613 (2021)].
In this preceding work, we found that the changing the degree of dineutron
correlation in $^{10}$Be leads to drastic changes of the inelastic cross
section for the 2$_2^+$ state. The development (or breaking) of the dineutron
correlation is governed by the strength of the spin-orbit interaction of the
structure calculation. However, in the previous work, some of the realistic
physical points were missing, for example, the binding energy. Therefore, we
reconstruct the $^{10}$Be nucleus by adjusting the effective nucleon-nucleon
interaction to obtain the reasonable binding energy of the ground state. With
this improvement, we again discuss the dineutron correlation in the $^{10}$Be

implications in astrophysics. Recent observations in the W43 molecular complex
of top-heavy CMFs, with an excess of high-mass cores compared to the canonical
mass distribution, raise questions about our understanding of the star
formation processes and their evolution in space and time. We aim to compare
populations of protostellar and prestellar cores in three regions imaged in the
ALMA-IMF Large Program. We created an homogeneous core catalogue in W43,
combining a new core extraction in W43-MM1 with the catalogue of W43-MM2&MM3
presented in a previous work. Our detailed search for protostellar outflows
enabled us to identify between 23 and 30 protostellar cores out of 127 cores in
W43-MM1 and between 42 and 51 protostellar cores out of 205 cores in
W43-MM2&MM3. Cores with neither outflows nor hot core emission are classified
as prestellar candidates. We found a similar fraction of cores which are
protostellar in the two regions, about 35%. This fraction strongly varies in
mass, from 15-20% at low mass, between 0.8 and 3$M_{\odot} $ up to about 80%
above 16$M_{\odot}$. Protostellar cores are found to be, on average, more
massive and smaller in size than prestellar cores. Our analysis also revealed
that the high-mass slope of the prestellar CMF in W43,
$\alpha=-1.46_{-0.19}^{+0.12}$, is consistent with the Salpeter slope, and thus
the top-heavy form measured for the global CMF, $\alpha=-0.96$, is due to the
protostellar core population. Our results could be explained by clump-fed
models in which cores grow in mass, especially during the protostellar phase,
through inflow from their environment. The difference between the slopes of the
prestellar and protostellar CMFs moreover implies that high-mass cores grow
more in mass than low-mass cores.

specialized machines can only handle binary variables, and their input format
is the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation.
Therefore, discretization is necessary to solve problems with continuous
variables. However, there is a severe constraint on the number of binary
variables with such machines. Although the simple binary expansion in the
previous research requires many binary variables, we need to reduce the number
of such variables in the QUBO formulation due to the constraint. We propose a
discretization method that involves using correlations of continuous variables.
We numerically show that the proposed method reduces the number of necessary
binary variables in the QUBO formulation without a significant loss in
prediction accuracy.

the Paschen lines (i.e., Paa/Hb, Pab/Hb, and the Paschen decrement, Paa/Pab),
suggesting that the former is sensitive to the overall dust obscuration towards
HII regions in high-redshift galaxies. The line ratios are used to derive the
nebular reddening, E(B-V)neb, and star-formation rates (SFRs). There is
marginal evidence that SFRs deduced from the Paschen lines may exceed by ~25%
those derived from the Balmer lines alone, suggesting the presence of star
formation that is optically thick in the Balmer lines, though deeper
observations are needed to confirm this result. Using the Paschen-line

different phenomena among which, inflation and dark energy are two of the most

model inflation and the dynamical generation of the Planck scale. In this
paper, motivated by a non minimally coupled scale invariant $R^{2}$
gravitational model originally proposed by M.Rinaldi and L. Vanzo, we
investigate how the inclusion of a vector scalar interaction that respects the
scale invariance of the original model may affect the early and late time
dynamics. We employ dynamical analysis tools in order to find the fixed points
of the system and the local solutions for each variable around each fixed point
finding out that the early universe solution of the extended model is
compatible with that found in the original model with the exception of a new
unstable fixed point appearing in the extended model. This new fixed point
however has the same linealized solutions as the unstable fixed point found for
the original model. We later employ numerical calculations in order to check
that the analytical approach holds. Furthermore we show how the dynamical
generation of the Planck mass is unaffected by the new field content of the
model. Finally, we motivate and investigate a reduced version of the extended
model finding out that, at late times, the extended model has only stable de
Sitter fixed points where the scalar field becomes constant taking the role of
the cosmological constant and the vector field is washed out.

AI system to determine when to override AI predictions. We conduct a
think-aloud, mixed-methods study with two explanation types (feature- and
example-based) for two prediction tasks to explore how decision-makers'
intuition affects their use of AI predictions and explanations, and ultimately
their choice of when to rely on AI. Our results identify three types of

intuition about the task outcome, features, and AI limitations. Building on

  Gravitational Lenses","8 pages, 7 figures",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the frontiers for advancing what is known about dark matter lies in
using strong gravitational lenses to characterize the population of the
smallest dark matter halos. There is a large volume of information in strong
gravitational lens images -- the question we seek to answer is to what extent
we can refine this information. To this end, we forecast the detectability of a
mixed warm and cold dark matter scenario using the anomalous flux ratio method
from strong gravitational lensed images. The halo mass function of the mixed
dark matter scenario is suppressed relative to cold dark matter but still
predicts numerous low-mass dark matter halos relative to warm dark matter.
Since the strong lens signal is a convolution over a range of dark matter halo
masses and since the signal is sensitive to the specific configuration of dark
matter halos, not just the halo mass function, degeneracies between different
forms of suppression in the halo mass function, relative to cold dark matter,
can arise. We find that, with a set of lenses with different configurations of
the main deflector and hence different sensitivities to different mass ranges
of the halo mass function, the different forms of suppression of the halo mass
function between the warm dark matter model and the mixed dark matter model can
be distinguished with $40$ lenses with Bayesian odds of 29.4:1.

  Correction",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Data-free quantization aims to achieve model quantization without accessing
any authentic sample. It is significant in an application-oriented context
involving data privacy. Converting noise vectors into synthetic samples through
a generator is a popular data-free quantization method, which is called
generative data-free quantization. However, there is a difference in attention
between synthetic samples and authentic samples. This is always ignored and
restricts the quantization performance. First, since synthetic samples of the
same class are prone to have homogenous attention, the quantized network can
only learn limited modes of attention. Second, synthetic samples in eval mode
and training mode exhibit different attention. Hence, the batch-normalization
statistics matching tends to be inaccurate. ACQ is proposed in this paper to
fix the attention of synthetic samples. An attention center position-condition
generator is established regarding the homogenization of intra-class attention.
Restricted by the attention center matching loss, the attention center position
is treated as the generator's condition input to guide synthetic samples in
obtaining diverse attention. Moreover, we design adversarial loss of paired
synthetic samples under the same condition to prevent the generator from paying
overmuch attention to the condition, which may result in mode collapse. To
improve the attention similarity of synthetic samples in different network
modes, we introduce a consistency penalty to guarantee accurate BN statistics
matching. The experimental results demonstrate that ACQ effectively improves
the attention problems of synthetic samples. Under various training settings,
ACQ achieves the best quantization performance. For the 4-bit quantization of
Resnet18 and Resnet50, ACQ reaches 67.55% and 72.23% accuracy, respectively.

Spiking Neurons, as the basic information processing unit of SNNs, are often

They used the AutoRegressive eXogenous (ARX) model to create a time-invariant

the causal anomalies by means of a method called fault propagation. There are
two major problems in describing the behavior of a machine by using the

instead of private raw data and labels. However, some recent works have shown
that the private labels could be leaked by the gradients. These existing attack
only works under the classification setting where the private labels are

the regression model, where the private labels are continuous numbers (instead
of discrete labels in classification). This makes previous attacks harder to
infer the continuous labels due to the unbounded output range. To address the
limitation, we propose a novel learning-based attack that integrates gradient

paper introduces RESUS (RESlicing of UltraSound Images), a weak supervision
data augmentation technique for ultrasound images based on slicing
reconstructed 3D volumes from tracked 2D images. This technique allows us to
generate views which cannot be easily obtained in vivo due to physical

these correspond to the module categories for their representation theory.
Until now, this has been done only for sl(2) (famously, the A-D-E

knowing the possible extensions of those VOAs, and the tensor equivalences
between those extensions. Recent progress puts the tensor equivalences in good
control, especially for sl(n). Our paper focuses on the extensions. We prove
that, for any simple g, there is a bound K(g) growing like the rank-cubed, such
that for any level k>K(g), the only extensions are generic (simple-current

of this paper is to propose a new path-based optimization model, called P-Path,

to enumerate two specific sets of paths which capture the essence of the choice
model associated with the adoption behavior of riders. With the help of these
path sets, the ODMTS-DA can be formulated as a single-level mixed-integer

comprehensive case studies: the mid-size transit system of the Ann Arbor

experimental results show that P-Path solves the Michigan ODMTS-DA instances in

large-scale ODMTS-DA instances (about 17 millions of variables and 37 millions

BC policies generalize poorly to new states, since the training mimics actions

careful reward engineering to achieve desirable behavior. We present PIRLNav, a

outperforms BC$\rightarrow$RL on SP and FE trajectories, even when controlled

RL-finetuning performance scales with the size of the BC pretraining dataset.
We find that as we increase the size of BC-pretraining dataset and get to high
BC accuracies, improvements from RL-finetuning are smaller, and that $90\%$ of
the performance of our best BC$\rightarrow$RL policy can be achieved with less
than half the number of BC demonstrations. Finally, we analyze failure modes of

these challenges, this article highlights how cyberattack taxonomies can be

It also reviews and analyzes current taxonomical classifications of

the proliferation of the scope and coverage in existing taxonomies. As a
result, these taxonomies are compiled into a more comprehensive and consistent
meta-taxonomy for the smart manufacturing space. The resulting meta-taxonomy
provides a holistic analysis of current taxonomies and integrates them into a

current attack taxonomies and provides directions for future improvements.
Finally, the paper introduces potential use cases for attack taxonomies in

through the manufacturing value chain and identify the manufacturing assets
that threat actors can access and compromise during a threat event. Third, the
proposed method identifies the attack path that maximizes the likelihood of
success and minimizes the attack detection probability, and then computes the
associated cybersecurity risk. Finally, the proposed risk modeling and
assessment framework is demonstrated via an interconnected smart manufacturing

learning issue on noisy labels. Current robust losses, however, inevitably
involve hyperparameters to be tuned for different datasets with noisy labels,
manually or heuristically through cross validation, which makes them fairly
hard to be generally applied in practice. Existing robust loss methods usually
assume that all training samples share common hyperparameters, which are
independent of instances. This limits the ability of these methods on
distinguishing individual noise properties of different samples, making them
hardly adapt to different noise structures. To address above issues, we propose
to assemble robust loss with instance-dependent hyperparameters to improve
their noise-tolerance with theoretical guarantee. To achieve setting such
instance-dependent hyperparameters for robust loss, we propose a meta-learning
method capable of adaptively learning a hyperparameter prediction function,
called Noise-Aware-Robust-Loss-Adjuster (NARL-Adjuster). Specifically, through
mutual amelioration between hyperparameter prediction function and classifier
parameters in our method, both of them can be simultaneously finely ameliorated
and coordinated to attain solutions with good generalization capability. Four
kinds of SOTA robust losses are attempted to be integrated with our algorithm,
and experiments substantiate the general availability and effectiveness of the
proposed method in both its noise tolerance and generalization performance.
Meanwhile, the explicit parameterized structure makes the meta-learned
prediction function capable of being readily transferrable and plug-and-play to
unseen datasets with noisy labels. Specifically, we transfer our meta-learned
NARL-Adjuster to unseen tasks, including several real noisy datasets, and
achieve better performance compared with conventional hyperparameter tuning
strategy.

limitation in UAVs and autonomous object recognition (for abnormal behavior

power limitation of UAVs, this paper proposes a novel aerial scheduling
algorithm between multi-UAVs and multi-towers where the towers conduct wireless
power transfer toward UAVs. In addition, to take care of the high-performance
learning model training in towers, we also propose a data delivery scheme which
makes UAVs deliver the training data to the towers fairly to prevent problems
due to data imbalance (e.g., huge computation overhead caused by larger data
delivery or overfitting from less data delivery). Therefore, this paper
proposes a novel workload-aware scheduling algorithm between multi-towers and
multi-UAVs for joint power-charging from towers to their associated UAVs and
training data delivery from UAVs to their associated towers. To compute the
workload-aware optimal scheduling decisions in each unit time, our solution
approach for the given scheduling problem is designed based on Markov decision

pseudo-polynomial optimality. As shown in performance evaluation results, our
proposed algorithm ensures (i) sufficient times for resource exchanges between
towers and UAVs, (ii) the most even and uniform data collection during the
processes compared to the other algorithms, and (iii) the performance of all
towers convergence to optimal levels.

life, industrial applications, and earth-science [1]. When unperturbed, they
form stable structures that resemble the ones of other amorphous solids like
metallic and colloidal glasses [2]. It is commonly conjectured that all these
amorphous materials show a universal mechanical response when sheared slowly,
i.e., to have an elastic regime, followed by yielding [3]. Here we use X-ray
tomography to determine the microscopic dynamics of a cyclically sheared
granular system in three dimensions. Independent of the shear amplitude
$\Gamma$, the sample shows a cross-over from creep to diffusive dynamics,
indicating that granular materials have no elastic response and always yield,
in stark contrast to other glasses. The overlap function [4] reveals that at
large $\Gamma$ yielding is a simple cross-over phenomenon, while for small
$\Gamma$ it shows features of a first order transition with a critical point at
$\Gamma\approx 0.1$ at which one finds a pronounced slowing down and dynamical
heterogeneity. Our findings are directly related to the surface roughness of
granular particles which induces a micro-corrugation to the potential energy
landscape, thus creating relaxation channels that are absent in simple glasses.
These processes must be understood for reaching an understanding of the complex
relaxation dynamics of granular systems.

has spurred the magnetism community to consider antiferromagnets for future
spintronic/magnonic applications. However, the excitation and control of
antiferromagnetic magnons remains challenging, especially when compared to
ferromagnetic counterparts. A middle ground is found with synthetic
antiferromagnet metamaterials, where acoustic and optical magnons exist at GHz
frequencies. In these materials, the magnon energy spectrum can be tuned by
static symmetry-breaking external fields or dipolar interactions hybridizing
optical and acoustic magnon branches. Here, we experimentally measure the
magnon energy spectrum of synthetic antiferromagnetic tetralayers, and discover
avoided energy level crossings in the energy spectrum that are unexplained by
the antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling. We explain our experimental results
using a phenomenological model incorporating both fieldlike and dampinglike
torques generated by spin pumping in noncollinear magnetic multilayers
separated by normal-metal spacers. We show that an asymmetry in the fieldlike
torques acting on different magnetic layers can lift the spectral degeneracies
of acoustic and optical magnon branches and yield symmetry-breaking induced
magnon-magnon interactions. Our work extends the phenomenology of spin pumping
to noncollinear magnetization configurations and significantly expands ways of
engineering magnon-magnon interactions within antiferromagnets and quantum

mechanisms to bid into auctions instead of directly bidding their value
manually. One prominent auto-bidding format is the target cost-per-acquisition
(tCPA) which maximizes the volume of conversions subject to a
return-of-investment constraint. From an auction theoretic perspective however,
this trend seems to go against foundational results that postulate that for
profit-maximizing bidders, it is optimal to use a classic bidding system like
marginal CPA (mCPA) bidding rather than using strategies like tCPA.
  In this paper we rationalize the adoption of such seemingly sub-optimal
bidding within the canonical quasi-linear framework. The crux of the argument
lies in the notion of commitment. We consider a multi-stage game where first
the auctioneer declares the auction rules; then bidders select either the tCPA
or mCPA bidding format and then, if the auctioneer lacks commitment, it can
revisit the rules of the auction (e.g., may readjust reserve prices depending
on the observed bids). Our main result is that so long as a bidder believes
that the auctioneer lacks commitment to follow the rule of the declared auction
then the bidder will make a higher profit by choosing the tCPA format over the
mCPA format.
  We then explore the commitment consequences for the auctioneer. In a
simplified version of the model where there is only one bidder, we show that
the tCPA subgame admits a credible equilibrium while the mCPA format does not.
That is, when the bidder chooses the tCPA format the auctioneer can credibly
implement the auction rules announced at the beginning of the game. We also
show that, under some mild conditions, the auctioneer's revenue is larger when
the bidder uses the tCPA format rather than mCPA. We further quantify the value
for the auctioneer to be able to commit to the declared auction rules.

is to adaptively integrate multiple levels of old knowledge and transfer it to

of old knowledge to naturally tune the importance of learning new knowledge

obviously challenges the understanding of the quantum anomalous Hall effect. To
this end, we propose that the coupling of chiral edge states, which has not

  Estimation","The first two authors have equal contribution",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transformer-based approaches have been successfully proposed for 3D human
pose estimation (HPE) from 2D pose sequence and achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance. However, current SOTAs have difficulties in modeling
spatial-temporal correlations of joints at different levels simultaneously.
This is due to the poses' spatial-temporal complexity. Poses move at various
speeds temporarily with various joints and body-parts movement spatially.
Hence, a cookie-cutter transformer is non-adaptable and can hardly meet the
""in-the-wild"" requirement. To mitigate this issue, we propose Hierarchical
Spatial-Temporal transFormers (HSTFormer) to capture multi-level joints'
spatial-temporal correlations from local to global gradually for accurate 3D
HPE. HSTFormer consists of four transformer encoders (TEs) and a fusion module.
To the best of our knowledge, HSTFormer is the first to study hierarchical TEs
with multi-level fusion. Extensive experiments on three datasets (i.e.,
Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and HumanEva) demonstrate that HSTFormer achieves
competitive and consistent performance on benchmarks with various scales and
difficulties. Specifically, it surpasses recent SOTAs on the challenging
MPI-INF-3DHP dataset and small-scale HumanEva dataset, with a highly
generalized systematic approach. The code is available at:

neutron stars (NSs) or black hole and NS mergers. Free neutrons might be
retained in the outermost layer of the ejecta to produce a precursor via
$\beta$-decay. During the propagation of kilonovae to observers, a small
percentage of them might be gravitationally lensed by foreground objects. In
this paper, three lens models, i.e., the point-mass model, the singular
isothermal sphere (SIS) model, and the Chang-Refsdal model, were taken into
consideration to explore the light curves and polarizations of gravitationally
lensed kilonovae. We found that if the time delay between two images exceeds
the ejecta heating timescale for the lens mass $\sim 10^{10}~M_\odot$ in the
SIS model, a tiny bump-like signal will be generated in the light curve, and
the total luminosity will be magnified in all cases. The polarization of lensed
kilonovae is significantly enhanced in most cases. Future detections of lensed
kilonovae will impose constraints on the morphology of the ejecta and aid in
the determination of the nature of compact object mergers and the search for
strong gravitational lenses.

significant challenges because of limited capabilities in perception and
interaction with complex traffic environments. Cooperative Driving
Automation~(CDA) has been considered a pivotal solution to next-generation
automated driving and intelligent transportation. Though CDA has attracted much
attention from both academia and industry, exploration of its potential is
still in its infancy. In industry, companies tend to build their in-house data
collection pipeline and research tools to tailor their needs and protect
intellectual properties. Reinventing the wheels, however, wastes resources and
limits the generalizability of the developed approaches since no standardized
benchmarks exist. On the other hand, in academia, due to the absence of
real-world traffic data and computation resources, researchers often
investigate CDA topics in simplified and mostly simulated environments,
restricting the possibility of scaling the research outputs to real-world
scenarios. Therefore, there is an urgent need to establish an open-source
ecosystem~(OSE) to address the demands of different communities for CDA
research, particularly in the early exploratory research stages, and provide
the bridge to ensure an integrated development and testing pipeline that
diverse communities can share. In this paper, we introduce the OpenCDA research
ecosystem, a unified OSE integrated with a model zoo, a suite of driving
simulators at various resolutions, large-scale real-world and simulated

information towards biomimetic computing applications due to their
pseudoparticle nature and efficient coupling to spin currents. A key hindrance
for skyrmionic devices is their instability against elongation at zero magnetic
field (ZF). Prevailing materials approaches focussed on tailoring skyrmion
energetics have found ZF configurations to be highly sensitive, which imposes
significant growth constraints and limits their device scalability. Here we
propose that designer ZF skyrmion configurations can be robustly stabilized
within chiral multilayer stacks by exploiting a duet of interlayer exchange
couplings (IECs). Microscopic imaging experiments show that varying the two
IECs enables the coarse and fine-tuning of ZF skyrmion stability and density.
Micromagnetic simulations reveal that the duo-IEC approach is distinguished by
its influence on the kinetics of skyrmion nucleation, in addition to the
ability to tailor energetics, resulting in a substantially expanded parameter
space, and enhanced stability for individual ZF skyrmions. Our work underscores
the importance of IEC as a means of stabilizing and controlling ZF skyrmions,
paving the way to scalable skyrmion-based devices.

adopt non-blind deblurring algorithms to reconstruct the sharp images. However,
these methods cannot be trained in an end-to-end manner and are usually
computationally expensive. In this paper, we explore optical flow to remove
dynamic scene blur by using the multi-scale spatially variant recurrent neural

RNN weights in different scales so that the weights can better help RNNs to
remove blur in the feature spaces. Finally, we develop a convolutional neural

astronomical data analysis and research. Due to the large amount of
astronomical catalogues generated by the ongoing and next-generation
large-scale sky surveys, the time complexity of the cross-matching is
increasing dramatically. Heterogeneous computing environments provide a
theoretical possibility to accelerate the cross-matching, but the performance
advantages of heterogeneous computing resources have not been fully utilized.
To meet the challenge of cross-matching for substantial increasing amount of
astronomical observation data, this paper proposes
Heterogeneous-computing-enabled Large Catalogue Cross-matcher (HLC2), a
high-performance cross-matching framework based on spherical position deviation
on CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing platforms. It supports scalable and flexible
cross-matching and can be directly applied to the fusion of large astronomical
cataloguesfrom survey missions and astronomical data centres. A performance
estimation model is proposed to locate the performance bottlenecks and guide
the optimizations. A two-level partitioning strategy is designed to generate an
optimized data placement according to the positions of celestial objects to
increase throughput. To make HLC2 a more adaptive solution, the
architecture-aware task splitting, thread parallelization, and concurrent
scheduling strategies are designed and integrated. Moreover, a novel
quad-direction strategy is proposed for the boundary problem to effectively
balance performance and completeness. We have experimentally evaluated HLC2
using public released catalogue data. Experiments demonstrate that HLC2 scales
well on different sizes of catalogues and the cross-matching speed is
significantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art cross-matchers.

zero-shot semantic segmentation. However, the use of a `background' embedding
during training in these methods is problematic as the resulting model tends to
over-learn and assign all unseen classes as the background class instead of
their correct labels. Furthermore, they ignore the semantic relationship of
text embeddings, which arguably can be highly informative for zero-shot
prediction as seen classes may have close relationship with unseen classes. To
this end, this paper proposes novel class enhancement losses to bypass the use
of the background embbedding during training, and simultaneously exploit the
semantic relationship between text embeddings and mask proposals by ranking the
similarity scores. To further capture the relationship between seen and unseen
classes, we propose an effective pseudo label generation pipeline using

with limited labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. To effectively
leverage the unlabeled data, pseudo labeling, along with the teacher-student

proved to be effective, this paradigm suffers from incorrect pseudo labels

the negative impact of incorrect pseudo labels, we delve into the current
Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation frameworks. We argue that the unlabeled
data with pseudo labels can facilitate the learning of representative features
in the feature extractor, but it is unreliable to supervise the mask predictor.
Motivated by this consideration, we propose a novel framework, Gentle Teaching
Assistant (GTA-Seg) to disentangle the effects of pseudo labels on feature
extractor and mask predictor of the student model. Specifically, in addition to
the original teacher-student framework, our method introduces a teaching
assistant network which directly learns from pseudo labels generated by the
teacher network. The gentle teaching assistant (GTA) is coined gentle since it
only transfers the beneficial feature representation knowledge in the feature
extractor to the student model in an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) manner,
protecting the student model from the negative influences caused by unreliable
pseudo labels in the mask predictor. The student model is also supervised by
reliable labeled data to train an accurate mask predictor, further facilitating
feature representation. Extensive experiment results on benchmark datasets
validate that our method shows competitive performance against previous
methods. Code is available at https://github.com/Jin-Ying/GTA-Seg.

reactions in biomolecules in solution. The theory sees a chemical reaction in
solution as a barrier crossing process, similar to the Marcus theory. The
barrier is defined as the crossing point of two free-energy surfaces which are
attributed to the reactant and product of the reaction. It is assumed that the
both free-energy surfaces are quadratic or harmonic. The assumption is based on
the Kim-Hirata theory of structural fluctuation of protein, which proves that
the fluctuation around an equilibrium structure is quadratic with respect to
the structure or atomic coordinates. The quadratic surface is a composite of
many harmonic functions with different modes or frequencies. The height of the
activation barrier will be dependent on the mode or frequency, less the
frequency, lower the barrier. So, it is essential to decouple the fluctuational
mode into a hierarchical order. GLMA is impeccable for this purpose.
  It is essential for a theoretical study of chemical reactions to chose a
reaction coordinate along which the reaction proceeds. We suppose that the mode
whose center of coordinate and/or the frequency changes most before and after
the reaction is the one relevant to the chemical reaction, and choose the
coordinate as the reaction coordinate. The rate of reaction along the reaction
coordinate is , which is similar to the Marcus expression for the electron

  In this work, we perform a large-scale quantitative analysis of the risk of
encountering malware and other potentially unwanted applications (PUA) across
user communities. At the core of our study is a dataset of app installation
logs collected from 12M Android mobile devices. Leveraging user-installed apps,
we define intuitive profiles based on users' interests (e.g., gamers and
investors), and fit a subset of 5.4M devices to those profiles. Our analysis is
structured in three parts. First, we perform risk analysis on the whole
population to measure how the risk of malicious app encounters is affected by
different factors. Next, we create different profiles to investigate whether
risk differences across users may be due to their interests. Finally, we
compare a per-profile approach for classifying clean and infected devices with
the classical approach that considers the whole population.
  We observe that features such as the diversity of the app signers and the use
of alternative markets highly correlate with the risk of malicious app
encounters. We also discover that some profiles such as gamers and social-media
users are exposed to more than twice the risks experienced by the average
users. We also show that the classification outcome has a marked accuracy
improvement when using a per-profile approach to train the prediction models.
Overall, our results confirm the inadequacy of one-size-fits-all protection

deposited at room temperature on a Cu(111) surface, fullerenes intermix with
the metal substrate. Surprisingly, 10 distinct copper-fullerene surface alloys

commensurability relationship with the substrate, is resolved using scanning

in the alloying process is associated to the multiple possibilities a fullerene

We show that a C6\u{psion}-symmetric triangular photonic crystal (PhC)

long baseline interferometry (VLBI) at 2/8 GHz (S/X) bands only, showing

polarization turns out to be described by a delicate balance between the
vorticity-to-spin transferring reactions in the core and the predominance of
corona over core matter at low energies. We show how this last feature provides
a key ingredient missing in our original model that helps to better describe
the excitation function for $\Lambda$ and $\overline{\Lambda}$ global
polarization. To improve the description, we then introduce the contribution to
the global polarization coming from the transverse polarization of $\Lambda$s
produced in the corona, which is hereby assumed to be similar to the well-known
polarization produced in p + p reactions. The results show a small positive
contribution to the global polarization, however they are not yet conclusive
due to the small size of the MC sample used in the analysis.

covering more than a year after the explosion, provide a unique opportunity to
study the poorly-understood evolution of massive stars in the final millennium
of their lives via changes in the mass-loss rate. Here, we present a result of
our long-term monitoring of a peculiar type IIL SN 2018ivc, using the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Following the initial decay, it
showed unprecedented rebrightening starting at ~ a year after the explosion.
This is one of the rare examples showing such rebrightening in the synchrotron
emission, and the first case at millimeter wavelengths. We find it to be in the
optically-thin regime unlike the optically-thick centimeter emission. As such,
we can robustly reconstruct the distribution of the circumstellar matter (CSM)
and thus the mass-loss history in the final ~1,000 years. We find that the
progenitor of SN 2018ivc had experienced a very high mass-loss rate >~10^{-3}
Msun/yr ~1,500 years before the explosion, which was followed by a moderately
high mass-loss rate (>~10^{-4} Msun/yr) up until the explosion. From this
behavior, we suggest SN 2018ivc represents an extreme version of a binary
evolution toward SNe IIb, which bridges the hydrogen-poor SNe (toward SNe Ib/c,
without a hydrogen envelope) and hydrogen-rich SNe (SNe IIP, with a massive
envelope).

estimate the contamination rate of our LAE candidates. We find that the

a median stacking method to identify the Ly$\alpha$ halo at $z=2$. We show that
the Ly$\alpha$ halo is extended to $\sim200$ kpc at a surface brightness level

redshifts and fields instead. To investigate how central galaxies affect
surrounding LAHs, we divide our LAEs into subsamples based on the Ly$\alpha$
luminosity ($L_{\rm Ly\alpha}$), rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width
(EW$_0$), and UV magnitude (M$_{\rm uv}$). We stack the subsamples and find
that higher $L_{\rm Ly\alpha}$, lower EW$_0$, and brighter M$_{\rm uv}$ cause
more extended halos. Our results suggest that more massive LAEs generally have

with a power-law function to measure the slopes. The slopes of LAEs and LABs
are similar, while the bright LABs show a $\approx 2$ times larger slope

show that the amplitudes of ACFs of LABs are higher than LAEs, which suggests
that LABs have a $\approx 10$ times larger galaxy bias and field-to-field

large differences of LAB numbers in our 8 fields.

density properties when surveying the high-z Universe with a small volume, such
uncertainties produce the field-to-field variance of galaxy number $\sigma_{g}$
in observational astronomy. This uncertainty significantly affects the
Luminosity Functions (LF) measurement of Lya Emitters (LAEs). For most previous
Lya LF studies, $\sigma_{g}$ is often adopted from predictions by cosmological
simulations, but barely confirmed by observations. Measuring cosmic variance
requires a huge sample over a large volume, exceeding the capabilities of most
astronomical instruments. In this study, we demonstrate an observational
approach for measuring the cosmic variance contribution for $z\approx2.2$ Lya
LFs. The LAE candidates are observed using narrowband and broadband of the
Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), with 8 independent fields, making the total
survey area $\simeq11.62$deg$^2$ and a comoving volume of
$\simeq8.71\times10^6$Mpc$^3$. These eight fields are selected using the

$\phi_{Lya}^{*}=4.87_{-0.55}^{+0.54}\times10^{-4}$Mpc$^{-3}$ for the overall
Lya LFs. After clipping out the regions that can bias the cosmic variance
measurements, we calculate $\sigma_{g}$, by sampling LAEs within multiple
pointings assigned on the field image. We investigate the relation between
$\sigma_{g}$ and survey volume $V$, and fit a simple power law:
$\sigma_g=k\times(\frac{V_{\rm eff}}{10^5 {\rm Mpc}^3})^{\beta}$. We find
best-fit values of $-1.209_{-0.106}^{+0.106}$ for $\beta$ and
$0.986_{-0.100}^{+0.108}$ for k. We compare our measurements with predictions

the study. Based on 25 years of observational data, we systematically analyzed
the quasi-periodic variations corresponding to the CME occurrence rate of
different angular widths in the northern and southern hemispheres, using
frequency and time-frequency analysis methods. There are various periods for

operation depends solely on the last $t$ symbols read. We construct
pseudorandom generators (PRGs) for low-space randomized sliding-window
algorithms that have access to a binary randomness source. More specifically,
we lift these algorithms to the non-uniform setting of branching programs and
study them as a subclass thereof that we call sliding-window branching programs
(SWBPs), accordingly. For general SWBPs, given a base PRG $G_\mathrm{base}$
with seed length $d_\mathrm{base}$ that $\varepsilon_\mathrm{base}$-fools
width-$w$, length-$t$ (general) branching programs, we give two PRG
constructions for fooling any same-width SWBP of length $n$ and window size $t$
(where we assume $w \ge n$). The first uses an additional $d_\mathrm{base} +
O(\log(n/t) \log(1/\varepsilon_\mathrm{base}))$ random bits, whereas the second
has a seed length of $O((d_\mathrm{base} + \log\log(n/t) +

accepted by a $T$-time one-sided error PACA (the PACA equivalent of

previous requirement on $T$, we show the same holds for $T$-time two-sided
error PACA (the PACA equivalent of $\mathsf{BPP}$) if we use $\tilde{O}(T) +

patient care remains difficult as the dynamics of the pelvic floor remains
poorly known. So far, only 2D dynamic observations of straining exercises at
excretion are available in the clinics and the understanding of
three-dimensional pelvic organs mechanical defects is not yet achievable. In
this context, we proposed a complete methodology for the 3D representation of
the non-reversible bladder deformations during exercises, directly combined
with synthesized 3D representation of the location of the highest strain areas
on the organ surface. Methods: Novel image segmentation and registration
approaches have been combined with three geometrical configurations of
up-to-date rapid dynamic multi-slices MRI acquisition for the reconstruction of
real-time dynamic bladder volumes. Results: For the first time, we proposed
real-time 3D deformation fields of the bladder under strain from in-bore forced
breathing exercises. The potential of our method was assessed on eight control
subjects undergoing forced breathing exercises. We obtained average volume
deviation of the reconstructed dynamic volume of bladders around 2.5\% and high
registration accuracy with mean distance values of 0.4 $\pm$ 0.3 mm and
Hausdorff distance values of 2.2 $\pm$ 1.1 mm. Conclusions: Immediately
transferable to the clinics with rapid acquisitions, the proposed framework
represents a real advance in the field of pelvic floor disorders as it
provides, for the first time, a proper 3D+t spatial tracking of bladder
non-reversible deformations. This work is intended to be extended to patients
with cavities filling and excretion to better characterize the degree of
severity of pelvic floor pathologies for diagnostic assistance or in

decrease in the Elongation Rate above ~3 EeV, as first discovered by the Pierre
Auger Collaboration over 15 year ago. Unless there is a dramatic change in the
hadronic physics above this energy, the mean mass of the primary cosmic rays
must increase as a function of energy, well into the decade beyond 10 EeV. To
estimate the mass, the use of hadronic models is required, the accuracy of
which remains uncertain. However, the possibility of a dramatic change in the
hadronic physics appears unlikely, and would be inconsistent with data from the

the anisotropy of arrival directions above 8 EeV. Both of these conclusions are

extracted from a Charge Breeder Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source
(CB-ECRIS). The comprehensive simulations, supported by experiments with a
Retarding Field Analyser (RFA), reveal that the longitudinal and transverse
energy spread of the extracted beams are strongly affected by the electrostatic
focusing effects, namely the extraction geometry and plasma beam boundary, to
the extent that the electrostatic effects dominate over the magnetic field
induced rotation of the beam or the effect of plasma potential and ion
temperature. The dominance of the electrostatic focusing effect over the
magnetic field induced rotation complicates parametric studies of the
transverse emittance as a function of the magnetic field strength, and
comparison of emittance values obtained with different ion sources having
different extraction designs. Our results demonstrate that the full ion beam
energy spread, relevant for the downstream accelerator, can be measured with
the RFA only when all ions are collected. On the contrary, studying the effect
of plasma properties (plasma potential and ion temperature) on the longitudinal
energy spread requires heavy collimation of the beam accepting only ions near
the symmetry axis of the beam for which the electrostatic and magnetic effects
are suppressed. As the extraction system of the CB-ECRIS is similar to a
conventional ECRIS, the conclusions of the study can be generalised to apply
for all high charge state ECR ion sources. Finally, we present the results of
systematic plasma potential measurements of the Phoenix-type CB-ECRIS at LPSC,
varying the source potential, the microwave power and the axial magnetic field
srength. It was observed that the plasma potential increases with the
extraction magnetic field and the microwave power.

cosmic rays via diffusive shock acceleration. However, many questions about the
physical conditions at shock fronts, such as the magnetic-field morphology
close to the particle acceleration sites, remain open. Here we report the
detection of a localized polarization signal from some synchrotron X-ray
emitting regions of Tycho's supernova remnant made by the Imaging X-ray
Polarimetry Explorer. The derived polarization degree of the X-ray synchrotron
emission is 9+/-2% averaged over the whole remnant, and 12+/-2% at the rim,
higher than the 7-8% polarization value observed in the radio band. In the west
region the polarization degree is 23+/-4%. The X-ray polarization degree in
Tycho is higher than for Cassiopeia A, suggesting a more ordered magnetic-field
or a larger maximum turbulence scale. The measured tangential polarization
direction corresponds to a radial magnetic field, and is consistent with that
observed in the radio band. These results are compatible with the expectation
of turbulence produced by an anisotropic cascade of a radial magnetic-field
near the shock, where we derive a magnetic-field amplification factor of
3.4+/-0.3. The fact that this value is significantly smaller than those
expected from acceleration models is indicative of highly anisotropic
magnetic-field turbulence, or that the emitting electrons either favor regions
of lower turbulence, or accumulate close to where the magnetic-field
orientation is preferentially radially oriented due to hydrodynamical
instabilities.

out on 12 regions of high column density from our 250 pc simulation. We find
that derived core masses are highly unreliable, with only {\em a weak
correlation between the masses of cores selected in the synthetic ALMA maps and
those of the corresponding three-dimensional cores}. The fraction of real
three-dimensional cores detected in the synthetic maps increases monotonically
with mass and remains always below 50\%. Above $\sim 1\,M_{\odot}$, the core
mass function derived from the column-density maps is steeper than that of the

the Berry curvature of the magnon bands. The magnitude of the effect is however
too small compared to the measurement by Czajka et al. [Nat. Mater. 22, 36-41

maximize $\kappa_{xy}/T$. Recent experiments suggest that phonons play an
important role, which we show couple to the spins, endowing phonons with
chirality. The resulting intrinsic contribution, from both magnons and phonons,
is however still insufficient to explain the observed magnitude of the Hall

that aims to derive robust representation directly from noisy images, without
the denoising as pre-processing. Here, the noise-robust representation is
designed as Fractional-order Moments in Radon space (FMR), with also beneficial
properties of orthogonality and rotation invariance. Unlike earlier
integer-order methods, our work is a more generic design taking such classical

time-frequency analysis capability that is not available in classical methods.

Both isobaric analogue and anti-analogue states are treated. We derive general
and explicit formulas for three-body systems using hyperspherical coordinates.
The example of the beta decaying $^{11}$Li ($^{9}$Li+$n$+$n$) is chosen as a
challenging application for numerical calculations of practical interest. The
detailed results are compared to existing experimental data and good agreement
is found at high excitation energies, where the isobaric analogue and
anti-analogue states are situated in the daughter nucleus. An interpretation of
the decay pattern at lower excitation energies is suggested. Decays of the
$^{9}$Li-core and the two halo-neutrons are individually treated and combined
to the daughter system with almost unique isospin, which we predict to be
broken by about $0.4\%$ probability. Properties of decay products are predicted
as possible future tests of this model.

sources using machine learning with hierarchical determination of classes. One
of the main challenges in the multi-class classification of the Fermi-LAT
sources is that the size of some of the classes is relatively small, for
example with less than 10 associated sources belonging to a class. In the paper
we propose a hierarchical structure for the determination of the classes. This
enables us to have control over the size of classes and to compare the
performance of the classification for different numbers of classes. In
particular, the class probabilities in the two-class case can be computed
either directly by the two-class classification or by summing probabilities of
children classes in multi-class classification. We find that the
classifications with few large classes have comparable performance with
classifications with many smaller classes. Thus, on the one hand, the few-class
classification can be recovered by summing probabilities of classification with
more classes while, on the other hand, the classification with many classes
gives a more detailed information about the physical nature of the sources. As
a result of this work, we construct three probabilistic catalogs. Two catalogs
are based on Gaussian mixture model for the determination of the groups of
classes: one with the requirement for the minimal number of sources in a group
to be larger than 100, which results in six final groups of physical classes,
while the other one has the requirement that the minimal number of sources in a
group is larger than 15, which results in nine groups of physical classes. The
third catalog is based on a random forest determination of the groups of
classes with the requirement that the minimal number of sources in a group is
larger than 100, which results in six groups of classes. (abridged)

dc battery, which breaks hard-wired batteries into smaller subunits. It can
rapidly control the output voltage and even contribute to voltage shaping of
the inverter. Based upon the rapid development of low-voltage transistors and
modular circuit topologies in the recent years, the proposed technology uses
recent 48 V power electronics to achieve higher-voltage output and reduce
losses in electric vehicle (EV) drive trains. The fast switching capability and
low loss of low-voltage field effect transistors (FET) allow sharing the
modulation with the main drive inverter. As such, the slower insulated-gate
bipolar transistors (IGBT) of the inverter can operate at ideal duty cycle and
aggressively reduced switching, while the adaptive dc battery provides an
adjustable voltage and all common-mode contributions at the dc link with lower
loss. Up to 2/3 of the switching of the main inverter is avoided. At high drive
speeds and thus large modulation indices, the proposed converter halves the
total loss compared to using the inverter alone; at lower speeds and thus
smaller modulation indices, the advantage is even more prominent because of the
dynamically lowered dc-link voltage. Furthermore, it can substantially reduce
the distortion, particularly at lower modulation indices, e.g., down to 1/2
compared to conventional space-vector modulation and even 1/3 for discontinuous
pulse-width modulation with hard-wired battery. Other benefits include
alleviated insulation stress for motor windings, active battery balancing, and
eliminating the vulnerability of large hard-wired battery packs to weak cells.
We demonstrate the proposed motor drive on a 3-kW setup with eight battery
modules.

wide debris disk suspected to be replenished partly by collisions between large

detected in this system by spectroscopy. After $\beta\,$Pictoris, this is
another example of a system possibly witnessing a phase of heavy bombardment of

with the CHEOPS space telescope in order to detect shallow transits of
exocomets with a typical expected duration of a few hours. The large
oscillations in the lightcurve indicate that HD$\,$172555 is a $\delta\,$Scuti
pulsating star. Once removing those dominating oscillations, we find a hint for
a transient absorption. If fitted with an exocomet transit model, it
corresponds to an evaporating body passing near the star at a distance of
$6.8\pm1.4\,$R$_\star$ (or $0.05\pm 0.01\,$au) with a radius of 2.5 km. These
properties are comparable to those of the exocomets already found in this

The nuclei of solar system's Jupiter family comets, with radii of 2-6$\,$km,
are also comparable in size. This is the first evidence for an exocomet

self consistent, relativistic accretion disc model. Not all of the TDEs inhabit
regions of parameter space where the model is valid, or have sufficient data
for a detailed analysis, and physically interpretable parameters for a
sub-sample of 11 TDEs are determined. These sources have thermal (power-law
free) X-ray spectra. The radial sizes measured from these spectra lie at values
consistent with the inner-most stable circular orbit of black holes with masses
given by the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relationship, and can be used as an
independent measurement of $M_{\rm BH}$. The bolometric disc luminosity can
also be inferred from X-ray data. All of the TDEs have luminosities which are
sub-Eddington ($L_{\rm bol, disc} \lesssim L_{\rm edd}$), and larger than the
typical hard-state transitional luminosity of X-ray binary discs ($L_{\rm bol,
disc} \gtrsim 0.01 L_{\rm edd}$). The {\it peak} bolometric luminosity is found
to be linearly correlated with the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ mass. The TDE
X-ray-to-bolometric correction can reach values up to $\sim 100$, and grows
exponentially at late times, resolving the missing energy problem. We show that
the peak disc luminosities of some TDEs are smaller than their observed optical
luminosities, implying that not all of the early time optical emission can be
sourced from reprocessed disc emission. Our results are supportive of the
hypothesis that thermal X-ray bright TDEs are in accretion states analogous to
the ``soft'' accretion state of X-ray binaries, and that black hole accretion
processes are scale (mass) invariant.

no consensus on testing methods, it is quite challenging to compare the
performance between algorithms. In this paper, we propose AvoidBench, a
benchmarking suite which can evaluate the performance of vision-based obstacle
avoidance algorithms by subjecting them to a series of tasks. Thanks to the
high fidelity of multi-rotors dynamics from RotorS and virtual scenes of
Unity3D, AvoidBench can realize realistic simulated flight experiments.
Compared to current drone simulators, we propose and implement both performance
and environment metrics to reveal the suitability of obstacle avoidance
algorithms for environments of different complexity. To illustrate AvoidBench's
usage, we compare three algorithms: Ego-planner, MBPlanner, and Agile-autonomy.
The trends observed are validated with real-world obstacle avoidance

to get more refined saliency maps. However, little attention is paid to how to
obtain the complete salient object in cluttered background, where the targets
are usually similar in color and texture to the background. To handle this
complex scene, we propose a sharp eyes network (SENet) that first seperates the
object from scene, and then finely segments it, which is in line with human
visual characteristics, i.e., to look first and then focus. Different from
previous methods which directly integrate edge or skeleton to supplement the
defects of objects, the proposed method aims to utilize the expanded objects to
guide the network obtain complete prediction. Specifically, SENet mainly
consists of target separation (TS) brach and object segmentation (OS) branch
trained by minimizing a new hierarchical difference aware (HDA) loss. In the TS
branch, we construct a fractal structure to produce saliency features with
expanded boundary via the supervision of expanded ground truth, which can
enlarge the detail difference between foreground and background. In the OS
branch, we first aggregate multi-level features to adaptively select
complementary components, and then feed the saliency features with expanded
boundary into aggregated features to guide the network obtain complete
prediction. Moreover, we propose the HDA loss to further improve the structural
integrity and local details of the salient objects, which assigns weight to
each pixel according to its distance from the boundary hierarchically. Hard
pixels with similar appearance in border region will be given more attention
hierarchically to emphasize their importance in completeness prediction.
Comprehensive experimental results on five datasets demonstrate that the
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively

in the ACM concept, compared to CM, allows the construction of ACMs that have
convenient matrix structures satisfying desired additional conditions,
compatibly with specific properties of the polynomial coefficients. We
demonstrate the construction of Hermitian and Unitary ACMs starting from
appropriate third degree polynomials, with implications for their use in
physical-mathematical problems such as the parameterization of the Hamiltonian,
density, or evolution matrix of a qutrit. We show that the ACM provides a means
of identifying properties of a given polynomial and finding its roots. For
example, we describe the ACM-based solution of cubic complex algebraic
equations without resorting to the use of the Cardano-Dal Ferro formulas. We
also show the necessary and sufficient conditions on the coefficients of a

and linear vertical gradient of temperature to study the linear dynamics of
equatorially trapped Rossby and inertia-gravity waves in interiors of radiative
stars. The governing equation is solved by the method of separation of
variables in the vertical and latitudinal directions. Vertical and latitudinal
solutions of the waves are found to be governed by Bessel functions and Hermite
polynomials, respectively. Appropriate boundary conditions at stellar surface
and poles define analytical dispersion relations for Rossby, Rossby-gravity and
inertia-gravity waves. The waves are confined in surface layers of 30-50 $H_0$,
where $H_0$ is surface density scale height, and trapped between the latitudes
of $\pm 60^0$. Observable frequencies (normalized by the angular frequency of
the stellar rotation) of Rossby waves with $m=1$ ($m=2$), where $m$ is the
toroidal wavenumber, are in the interval of 0.65-1 (1.4-2), depending on
stellar rotation, radius and surface temperature. Rossby-type waves can be

valuable information about the chemistry and physics of the gas and eventually,
the history of molecular clouds. In this context, the origin of an abundance of
c-HCOOH acid of only 6% the isomer c-HCOOH abundance in cold cores, remains
unknown. Herein, we explain the presence of c-HCOOH in dark molecular clouds
through the destruction and back formation of c-HCOOH and t-HCOOH in a cyclic
process that involves HCOOH and highly abundant molecules such as HCO+ and NH3.
We use high-level ab initio methods to compute the potential energy profiles
for the cyclic destruction/formation routes of c-HCOOH and t-HCOOH. Global rate
constants and branching ratios were calculated based on the transition state
theory and the master equation formalism under the typical conditions of the
ISM. The destruction of HCOOH by reaction with HCO+ in the gas phase leads to
three isomers of the cation HC(OH)2+. The most abundant cation can react in a
second step with other abundant molecules of the ISM like NH3 to form back
c-HCOOH and t-HCOOH. This mechanism explains the formation of c-HCOOH in dark
molecular clouds. Considering this mechanism, the fraction of c-HCOOH with
respect t-HCOOH is 25.7%. To explain the 6% reported by the observations we
propose that further destruction mechanisms of the cations of HCOOH should be
taken into account. The sequential acid-base (SAB) mechanism proposed in this
work involves fast processes with very abundant molecules in the ISM. Thus,
HCOOH very likely suffers our proposed transformations in the conditions of
dark molecular clouds. This is a new approach in the framework of the isomerism
of organic molecules in the ISM which has the potential to try to explain the
ratio between isomers of organic molecules detected in the ISM.

complexity from a single interaction term (assuming all pairs of species

the response and species interactions, giving rise to Generalized

to the model selection process: we could (a) select the interaction structure
first by assuming {\theta}=1 and then estimate {\theta}, or (b) estimate

{\theta}, or (c) test for {\theta} and its inclusion for each interaction

response latencies to individual elements of the Rotating Snakes pattern by
probing internal units in the network. A pretrained PredNet model predicted
illusory motion for all subcomponents of the Rotating Snakes stimulus,
consistent with human observers. However, we found no simple response delays in
internal units, as found in physiological data. The PredNet model's detection
of motion in gradients was based on contrast, not luminance, as it is in human
perception. Finally, we tested the robustness of the illusion on 10 identical
PredNets trained on the same video data; we found a large variation in the
ability of the network to reproduce the illusion and predict motion for
simplified variants of the illusion. Also, unlike human observers, none of the
networks predicted illusory motion for greyscale variants of the pattern. Even
when a DNN successfully reproduces some idiosyncrasy of human vision, a more
detailed investigation can reveal inconsistencies between humans and the

their relation to the renormalized effective action, which is defined by an
ordinary path integral over a conformal sector, in an external gravitational
background. In anomaly-induced actions, the issue of scale breaking is usually
not addressed, since these actions are obtained only by solving the trace
anomaly constraint and are determined by scale invariant functionals. We
investigate the changes induced in the structure of such actions once
identified in dimensional renormalization (DR) when the $\epsilon = d-4 \to 0$
limit is accompanied by the dimensional reduction (DRed) of the field
dependencies. We show that operatorial nonlocal modifications
$(\sim\Box^\epsilon)$ of the counterterms are unnecessary to justify a scale
anomaly. In this case, only the ordinary finite subtractions play a critical
role in the determination of the scale breaking. This is illustrated for the WZ
form of the effective action and its WZ consistency condition, as seen from a
renormalization procedure. Logarithmic corrections from finite subtractions are
also illustrated in a pure $d=4$ (cutoff) scheme. The interplay between two
renormalization schemes, one based on dimensional regularization (DR) and the
second on a cutoff in $d=4$, illustrates the ambiguities of DR in handling the
quantum corrections in a curved background. Therefore, using DR in a curved
background, the scale and trace anomalies can both be obtained by counterterms
that are Weyl invariant only at $d=4$.

matches the subset of texts with the video features. To produce temporal
boundaries, frame features in several videos are manually merged into a long

The temporal
evolution of the corresponding cycle phase, that is, the deviation of the
epochs of activity minima or maxima from strict periodicity, provides relevant
information concerning the physical mechanism underlying the cyclic magnetic
activity. An underlying strictly periodic process (akin to a perfect ""clock""),
with the observer seeing a superposition of the perfect clock and a small
random phase perturbation, leads to long-term phase stability in the
observations. Such behavior would be expected if cycles were synchronized by
tides caused by orbiting planets or by a hypothetical torsional oscillation in
the solar radiative interior. Alternatively, in the absence of such
synchronization, phase fluctuations accumulate and a random walk of the phase
ensues, which is a typical property of randomly perturbed dynamo models. Based
on the sunspot record and the reconstruction of solar cycles from cosmogenic
C14, we carried out rigorous statistical tests in order to decipher whether
there exists phase synchronization or random walk. Synchronization is rejected
at significance levels of between 95% (28 cycles from sunspot data) and beyond
99% (84 cycles reconstructed from C14, while the existence of random walk in
the phases is consistent with all data sets. This result strongly supports
randomly perturbed dynamo models with little inter-cycle memory.

increase of the runaway electron plateau current. Mitigation via massive

several problems in KR with growing industrial applications. Also for studies
of computational complexity and deeper insights into the hardness and its

resulted in fruitful characterizations in terms of complexity classes,
fine-grained insights in form of dichotomy-style results, as well as detailed
parameterized complexity landscapes. Recently, this lead to a novel result
establishing that for the measure treewidth, which captures structural density
of a program, the evaluation of the well-known class of normal programs is
expected to be slightly harder than deciding satisfiability (SAT). However, it
is unclear how to utilize this structural power of ASP. This paper deals with a
novel reduction from SAT to normal ASP that goes beyond well-known encodings:
We explicitly utilize the structural power of ASP, whereby we sublinearly
decrease the treewidth, which probably cannot be significantly improved. Then,
compared to existing results, this characterizes hardness in a fine-grained way
by establishing the required functional dependency of the dependency graph's
cycle length (SCC size) on the treewidth.

based on an oriented derivative of stick (ODoS) filter and a deep learning
network for curvilinear object segmentation in medical images. Currently, a
large number of deep learning models emphasize developing deep architectures
and ignore capturing the structural features of curvilinear objects, which may
lead to unsatisfactory results. Consequently, a new approach that incorporates
an ODoS filter as part of a deep learning network is presented to improve the
spatial attention of curvilinear objects. Specifically, the input image is
transfered into four-channel image constructed by the ODoS filter. In which,
the original image is considered the principal part to describe various image
appearance and complex background illumination conditions, a multi-step
strategy is used to enhance the contrast between curvilinear objects and their
surrounding backgrounds, and a vector field is applied to discriminate thin and
uneven curvilinear structures. Subsequently, a deep learning framework is
employed to extract various structural features for curvilinear object
segmentation in medical images. The performance of the computational model is
validated in experiments conducted on the publicly available DRIVE, STARE and

on large, real-world graphs is loading node features onto a GPU. Due to limited
GPU memory, expensive data movement is necessary to facilitate the storage of
these features on alternative devices with slower access (e.g. CPU memory).
Moreover, the irregularity of graph structures contributes to poor data
locality which further exacerbates the problem. Consequently, existing
frameworks capable of efficiently training large GNN models usually incur a
significant accuracy degradation because of the inevitable shortcuts involved.
To address these limitations, we instead propose ReFresh, a general-purpose GNN
mini-batch training framework that leverages a historical cache for storing and
reusing GNN node embeddings instead of re-computing them through fetching raw
features at every iteration. Critical to its success, the corresponding cache
policy is designed, using a combination of gradient-based and staleness
criteria, to selectively screen those embeddings which are relatively stable
and can be cached, from those that need to be re-computed to reduce estimation

because of its high intensity far beyond the Planck's black-body limit.
Insertion of a third object in proximity of the two particles can significantly
influence and manipulate its NFRHT. However, for the system composed of many
particles, effect of the many-body interaction (MBI) on the NFRHT between
arbitrary two particles of interest caused by the neighboring particles lying
in proximity is still unclear (namely, 'proximate' MBI), which is the focus of
this work. Three typical kinds of the proximate ensemble: one-dimensional
particle chain, two-dimensional square-lattice particle plane and particle
grating, are considered by using the many-body radiative heat transfer theory.
When increasing the proximate particle size, the effect of many-body
interaction on NFRHT will experience a radical change from inhibition to
enhancement. It is worth mentioning that the unique enhancement on NFRHT caused
by the proximate particle chain is different from the reported inhibition
effect. The proximate particle polarizability increases when increasing the
particle radius, which will affect the interaction between the proximate
particles and the main particle (even when the main particle size does not
change at all), and then results in enhancement of heat transfer between the
main particles. As for the symmetry breaking effect on the NFRHT, when twisting
the proximate particle ensemble, the proximate MBI accounts for a smooth and
non-oscillated twisting angle dependence of NFRHT, different from the
oscillation phenomenon of NFRHT for particle gratings mediated by the
intra-ensemble and inter-ensemble MBI. This work will deepen the understanding

options, typically to enhance software's quantifiable quality attributes, such

been used in this situation to assist the designer in selecting appropriate
trade-offs between a number of non-functional features. Through automated
refactoring, design alternatives can be produced in this process, and assessed
using non-functional models.
  This type of optimization tasks are hard and time- and resource-intensive,
which frequently hampers their use in software engineering procedures.
  In this paper, we present our optimization framework where we examined the
performance of various genetic algorithms. We also exercised our framework with
two case studies with various levels of size, complexity, and domain served as

  influence on atmosphere outgassing","31 pages, 9+2 figures, accepted for publication in PSJ",,,,"astro-ph.EP physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Magma oceans are episodes of large-scale melting of the mantle of terrestrial
planets. The energy delivered by the Moon-forming impact induced a deep magma
ocean on the young Earth, corresponding to the last episode of core-mantle
equilibration. The crystallization of this magma ocean led to the outgassing of
volatiles initially present in the Earth's mantle, resulting in the formation
of a secondary atmosphere. During outgassing, the magma ocean acts as a
chemical buffer for the atmosphere via the oxygen fugacity, set by the
equilibrium between ferrous- and ferric-iron oxides in the silicate melts. By
tracking the evolution of the oxygen fugacity during magma ocean
solidification, we model the evolving composition of a C-O-H atmosphere. We use
the atmosphere composition to calculate its thermal structure and radiative
flux. This allows us to calculate the lifetime of the terrestrial magma ocean.
We find that, upon crystallizing, the magma ocean evolves from a mildly
reducing to a highly oxidized redox state, thereby transiting from a CO- and
H2-dominated atmosphere to a CO2- and H2O-dominated one. We find the overall
duration of the magma ocean crystallization to depend mostly on the bulk H
content of the mantle, and to remain below 1.5 millions years for up to 9
Earth's water oceans' worth of H. Our model also suggests that reduced
atmospheres emit lower infrared radiation than oxidized ones, despite of the
lower greenhouse effect of reduced species, resulting in a longer magma ocean
lifetime in the former case. Although developed for a deep magma ocean on
Earth, the framework applies to all terrestrial planet and exoplanet magma
oceans, depending on their volatile budgets.

moment (J2) might exhibit a temporal variation. The suggested explanation is
through the temporal variation of the solar rotation with latitude. This issue
is deeper developed due to an accurate knowledge of the long-term variations in
solar differential rotation regarding solar activity. Here we analyze solar
cycles 12-24, investigating the long-term temporal variations in solar
differential rotation. It is shown that J2 exhibits a net modulation over the
13 studied cycles of approximately (89.6 +- 0.1) yr, with a peak-to-peak
amplitude of approximately 0.1 x 10-7 for a reference value of 2.07 x 10-7).
Moreover, J2 exhibits a positive linear trend in the period of minima solar
activity (sunspot number up to around 40) and a marked declining trend in the
period of maxima (sunspot number above 50). In absolute magnitude, the mean
value of J2 is more significant during periods of minimum than in periods of
maximum. These findings are based on observational results that are not free of
errors and can be refined further by considering torsional oscillations for
example. They are comforted by identifying a periodic variation of the J2 term
evidenced through the analysis of the perihelion precession of planetary orbits
either deduced from ephemerides or computed in the solar equatorial coordinate
system instead of the ecliptic coordinate one usually used.

recent years, as it can assist end users in efficiently extracting vital
information from databases without the need for technical background. One of
the major challenges in text-to-SQL parsing is domain generalization, i.e., how
to generalize well to unseen databases. Recently, the pre-trained text-to-text
transformer model, namely T5, though not specialized for text-to-SQL parsing,
has achieved state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks targeting
domain generalization. In this work, we explore ways to further augment the
pre-trained T5 model with specialized components for text-to-SQL parsing. Such
components are expected to introduce structural inductive bias into text-to-SQL
parsers thus improving model's capacity on (potentially multi-hop) reasoning,
which is critical for generating structure-rich SQLs. To this end, we propose a
new architecture GRAPHIX-T5, a mixed model with the standard pre-trained
transformer model augmented by some specially-designed graph-aware layers.
Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of GRAPHIX-T5
across four text-to-SQL benchmarks: SPIDER, SYN, REALISTIC and DK. GRAPHIX-T5
surpass all other T5-based parsers with a significant margin, achieving new
state-of-the-art performance. Notably, GRAPHIX-T5-large reach performance
superior to the original T5-large by 5.7% on exact match (EM) accuracy and 6.6%

whereas running large-scale controlled experiments is often practically
impossible. Thus, most empirical studies can only report statistical
correlations -- instead of potentially more insightful and robust causal
relations.
  This paper discusses some novel techniques that support analyzing purely
observational data for causal relations. Using fundamental causal models such
as directed acyclic graphs, one can rigorously express, and partially validate,
causal hypotheses; and then use the causal information to guide the
construction of a statistical model that captures genuine causal relations --
such that correlation does imply causation.
  We apply these ideas to analyzing public data about programmer performance in
Code Jam, a large world-wide coding contest organized by Google every year.
Specifically, we look at the impact of different programming languages on a
participant's performance in the contest. While the overall effect associated
with programming languages is weak compared to other variables -- regardless of
whether we consider correlational or causal links -- we found considerable
differences between a purely statistical and a causal analysis of the very same
data. The takeaway message is that even an imperfect causal analysis of
observational data can help answer the salient research questions more
precisely and more robustly than with just purely statistical techniques.

collection of weighted sets, each with at most $k$ elements and must return a
collection of pairwise disjoint sets with maximum total weight. For $k = 3$,
this problem generalizes the classical 3-dimensional matching problem listed as
one of the Karp's original 21 NP-complete problems. We give an algorithm
attaining an approximation factor of $1.786$ for weighted 3-set packing,
improving on the recent best result of $2-\frac{1}{63,700,992}$ due to
Neuwohner.
  Our algorithm is based on the local search procedure of Berman that attempts
to improve the sum of squared weights rather than the problem's objective. When
using exchanges of size at most $k$, this algorithm attains an approximation
factor of $\frac{k+1}{2}$. Using exchanges of size $k^2(k-1) + k$, we provide a
relatively simple analysis to obtain an approximation factor of 1.811 when $k =
3$. We then show that the tools we develop can be adapted to larger exchanges
of size $2k^2(k-1) + k$ to give an approximation factor of 1.786. Although our
primary focus is on the case $k = 3$, our approach in fact gives slightly
stronger improvements on the factor $\frac{k+1}{2}$ for all $k > 3$. As in

observational bias of detected flare events from different missions (e.g.
Kepler and TESS) vary a lot. We use a unified data processing and detection
method for flares events based on the light curve from Kepler and TESS. Then we
perform injection and recovery tests in the original light curve of each star
for each flare event to correct the completeness and energy of flares. Three
samples of flaring stars are selected from Kepler and TESS, with rotating

revealing a more natural flaring frequency and energy distribution. Our results
also extend the low-energy limit in cumulative FFD fitting to $10^{31.5-33}$
erg on different types of stars. For solar-type stars, the average power-law
index of cumulative FFD ($\alpha_{\rm cum}$) is $-0.84$, which indicates that
low-energy flares contribute less to the total flare energy. With a piecewise

difficulty). However, unlike general free-format texts (e.g., user comments),
mathematical questions are generally designed with explicit purposes and
mathematical logic, and usually consist of more complex content, such as
formulas, and related mathematical knowledge (e.g., Function). Therefore, the
problem of holistically representing mathematical questions remains
underexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel contrastive
pre-training approach for mathematical question representations, namely QuesCo,
which attempts to bring questions with more similar purposes closer.
Specifically, we first design two-level question augmentations, including

assumptions in two-player turn-based finite graph games which characterize an
``adequate cooperation'' needed from the environment to allow the system player
to win. Given an $\omega$-regular winning condition $\Phi$ for the system
player, we compute an $\omega$-regular assumption $\Psi$ for the environment
player, such that (i) every environment strategy compliant with $\Psi$ allows
the system to fulfill $\Phi$ (sufficiency), (ii) $\Psi$ can be fulfilled by the
environment for every strategy of the system (implementability), and (iii)
$\Psi$ does not prevent any cooperative strategy choice (permissiveness).
  For parity games, which are canonical representations of $\omega$-regular
games, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for the symbolic computation of
adequately permissive assumptions and show that our algorithm runs faster and
produces better assumptions than existing approaches -- both theoretically and
empirically. To the best of our knowledge, for $\omega$-regular games, we
provide the first algorithm to compute sufficient and implementable environment
assumptions that are also permissive.

computational task can be decomposed into a finite set of logic gates operating
on one and two qubits. However, the process of such decomposition is generally
inefficient, often leading to exponentially many gates to realize an arbitrary
computational task. Practical processor designs benefit greatly from
availability of multi-qubit gates that operate on more than two qubits to
implement the desired circuit. In 1995, Cirac and Zoller proposed a method to
realize native multi-qubit controlled-$Z$ gates in trapped ion systems, which
has a stringent requirement on ground-state cooling of the motional modes
utilized by the gate. An alternative approach, the M\o lmer-S\o rensen gate, is
robust against residual motional excitation and has been a foundation for many
high-fidelity gate demonstrations. This gate does not scale well beyond two
qubits, incurring additional overhead when used to construct many target
algorithms. Here, we take advantage of novel performance benefits of long ion
chains to realize fully programmable and scalable high-fidelity Cirac-Zoller

policy uses weighted in-degrees (WiDs), derived from the adjacency matrices of
graph attention networks (GATs), and a dissimilarity measure to select the most
salient and at the same time diverse frames representing the event in the
video. Additionally, the proposed gating mechanism fetches the selected frames
sequentially, and commits early-exiting when an adequately confident decision
is achieved. In this way, only a few frames are processed by the
computationally expensive branch of our network that is responsible for the
bottom-up information extraction. The experimental evaluation on two large,
publicly available video datasets (MiniKinetics, ActivityNet) demonstrates that
Gated-ViGAT provides a large computational complexity reduction in comparison

material. In this paper, we use Hamilton's principle of least action to derive
the averaged stress tensor of discrete granular assemblies subjected to
hydraulic force fields, as well as rigorous conditions for a proper definition
of the Representative Volume Element (RVE). The main goal behind our efforts is
to upscale particle physics into a sound stress tensor for systems involving
the complex interaction between grains and water. We identify the contributions
from the unbalanced forces, hydraulic forces, gravity, external forces, and
particle fluctuation to the mean stress tensor. In doing so, it is convenient
to separate the influence of different force fields when the granular system is
subjected to complex environments, e.g., subaqueous conditions. The obtained
formula is then validated by triaxial test simulations of dry and saturated
granular systems using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the
Lattice-Boltzmann Method (LBM). The results show that the deduced formula can
accurately calculate the stress tensor of discrete assemblies with various
body-force fields. We used validated DEM-LBM simulations of submerged granular
column collapses to explore the physics happening at the grain scale with this
mathematical formalism and showcase its potential. We provide a new perspective
based on the granular assembly scale to pursue the fluid-solid interaction. Due
to the importance of stress analysis in the constitutive modelling of granular
materials, this work could help to better obtain the stress-strain relationship

multiple baseline models are first learnt, then a meta-model is learnt using
the outputs of the baseline level model to form a model that outperforms the

joint representation learning of 3D point cloud with text remains
under-explored due to the difficulty of 3D-Text data pair acquisition and the
irregularity of 3D data structure. In this paper, we propose a novel Text4Point
framework to construct language-guided 3D point cloud models. The key idea is
utilizing 2D images as a bridge to connect the point cloud and the language
modalities. The proposed Text4Point follows the pre-training and fine-tuning
paradigm. During the pre-training stage, we establish the correspondence of
images and point clouds based on the readily available RGB-D data and use
contrastive learning to align the image and point cloud representations.
Together with the well-aligned image and text features achieved by CLIP, the
point cloud features are implicitly aligned with the text embeddings. Further,
we propose a Text Querying Module to integrate language information into 3D
representation learning by querying text embeddings with point cloud features.
For fine-tuning, the model learns task-specific 3D representations under
informative language guidance from the label set without 2D images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model shows consistent improvement on various
downstream tasks, such as point cloud semantic segmentation, instance
segmentation, and object detection. The code will be available here:

statistically meaningful number of micron-sized particles with a sufficiently
good resolution to allow for the analysis of individual particles. However, the
development of methods to efficiently investigate such image data and
interpretably model the observed particle features is still an active field of
research. When image data of particles exhibiting a wide range of shapes and
sizes is considered, traditional image segmentation methods, such as the
classic watershed algorithm, struggle to recognize particles with satisfying
accuracy. Thus, more advanced methods of machine learning must be utilized for
image segmentation to improve the validity of subsequent analyzes. Moreover, CT
data does not include information about the mineralogical composition of
particles and, therefore, additional SEM-EDS image data has to be acquired. In
this paper, micro-CT image data of a particle system mostly consisting of
zinnwaldite-quartz composites is considered. First, an image segmentation
method is applied which uses deep convolutional neural networks, in particular
an adaptation of the U-net architecture. This has the advantage of requiring
less hand-labeling than other machine learning methods, while also being more
flexible with the possibility of transfer learning. Then, fully parameterized
models based on vine copulas are designed to determine multivariate probability
distributions of descriptor vectors for the size, shape, texture and
composition of particles -- allowing for the estimation and interpretable
characterization of interdependencies between particle descriptors. For model
fitting, the segmented three-dimensional CT data and co-registered
two-dimensional SEM-EDS data are used.

considered as a promising avenue for enhancing the performance of organic
electronic devices including solar cells, light emitting diodes, and
transistors, thanks to their well-controlled, uniform electronic properties and
high carrier mobilities. Although the phenomenon of organic epitaxy has been
known for decades, computational methods for structure prediction of epitaxial
organic interfaces have lagged far behind the existing methods for their
inorganic counterparts. We present a method for structure prediction of
epitaxial organic interfaces based on lattice matching followed by surface
matching, implemented in the open-source Python package, Ogre. The lattice
matching step produces domain-matched interfaces, where commensurability is
achieved with different integer multiples of the substrate and film unit cells.
In the surface matching step, Bayesian optimization (BO) is used to find the
interfacial distance and registry between the substrate and film. The BO
objective function is based on dispersion corrected deep neural network
interatomic potentials, shown to be in excellent agreement with density
functional theory (DFT). The application of Ogre is demonstrated for an
epitaxial interface of 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) on
tetrathiafulvalene (TTF), whose electronic structure has been probed by
ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS), but whose structure had been
hitherto unknown [Organic Electronics 48, 371 (2017)]. We find that TCNQ(001)
on top of TTF(100) is the most stable interface configuration, closely followed
by TCNQ(010) on top of TTF(100). The density of states, calculated using DFT,

charge transfer state.

downward redshift evolution. The derived O/H together with the hard X-ray
luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$) were used to study the X-ray luminosity-metallicity

contrast to the broad-line focused ($L_{\rm X}$-$Z_{\rm BLR}$) studies, we find
that the $L_{\rm X}$-$Z_{\rm NLR}$ exhibit significant anti-correlations with
the Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$) and these correlations vary with

extended MHD simulations covering the dynamics over tens of milliseconds. The
equilibrium is close to the ideal peeling limit and non-linearly develops
saturated modes at the edge of the plasma. A dominant toroidal mode number of

supervised and self-supervised learning problems, but so far these successes
have not fully translated to reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we
demonstrate that training an RL agent at scale leads to a general in-context
learning algorithm that can adapt to open-ended novel embodied 3D problems as
quickly as humans. In a vast space of held-out environment dynamics, our
adaptive agent (AdA) displays on-the-fly hypothesis-driven exploration,
efficient exploitation of acquired knowledge, and can successfully be prompted
with first-person demonstrations. Adaptation emerges from three ingredients:
(1) meta-reinforcement learning across a vast, smooth and diverse task
distribution, (2) a policy parameterised as a large-scale attention-based
memory architecture, and (3) an effective automated curriculum that prioritises
tasks at the frontier of an agent's capabilities. We demonstrate characteristic
scaling laws with respect to network size, memory length, and richness of the
training task distribution. We believe our results lay the foundation for
increasingly general and adaptive RL agents that perform well across
ever-larger open-ended domains.

techniques to model systems. The goal of such models is to efficiently solve
for the underlying field by combining measurements with known physical laws. As
many systems contain unknown elements, such as missing parameters, noisy data,
or incomplete physical laws, this is widely approached as an uncertainty
quantification problem. The common techniques to handle all the variables
typically depend on the numerical scheme used to approximate the posterior, and
it is desirable to have a method which is independent of any such
discretization. Information field theory (IFT) provides the tools necessary to
perform statistics over fields that are not necessarily Gaussian. We extend IFT
to physics-informed IFT (PIFT) by encoding the functional priors with
information about the physical laws which describe the field. The posteriors
derived from this PIFT remain independent of any numerical scheme and can
capture multiple modes, allowing for the solution of problems which are
ill-posed. We demonstrate our approach through an analytical example involving
the Klein-Gordon equation. We then develop a variant of stochastic gradient
Langevin dynamics to draw samples from the joint posterior over the field and
model parameters. We apply our method to numerical examples with various
degrees of model-form error and to inverse problems involving nonlinear
differential equations. As an addendum, the method is equipped with a metric
which allows the posterior to automatically quantify model-form uncertainty.
Because of this, our numerical experiments show that the method remains robust
to even an incorrect representation of the physics given sufficient data. We
numerically demonstrate that the method correctly identifies when the physics
cannot be trusted, in which case it automatically treats learning the field as
a regression problem.

phenomena of a cross-flow turbine blade utilizing modal analysis to identify
pertinent events within the cycle. The complexity is generated by the
kinematics of the blade rotation which generates a curved relative flow, a
non-sinusoidal variation of relative flow speed and angle of attack, and the
necessity of travelling through its own wake. These kinematic variations have
challenged traditional predictors of dynamic stall such as pitch rate, pitching
moment or relative angle of attack. Proper orthogonal decomposition of velocity
fields from a large-eddy simulation is employed to analyze the spatio-temporal
evolution of the dominant flow features. The modes' time development
coefficients capture the trend of relative flow velocity magnitude and lift
generation on the blade, along with critical events such as vortex formation
and detachment. These correlations are examined across two tip-speed ratios,
revealing a stronger correlation at the higher rotation rate. To demonstrate
the application of modal analysis, a non-constant rotation rate (intracycle
control or angular velocity) that enhances power generation by 40\% is analyzed
and directly compared to the constant velocity rotation. By extracting common
modes between the two simulations it is seen that the modified stall behavior
is responsible for the additional power extraction, correlating with enhanced
torque generation. Finally, flow curvature, history effects, and flow induction
are identified as significant factors that modify the force and moment curves
as compared to pitching or plunging foils.

quasi-geostrophic equations by incorporating the effects of moisture. This

the impact on network-level resource allocation and handover. In this work, we

infinitesimally thin layers of cloud particulates, thermally emitting at the
source optical depth $\tau'$. For thin isothermal clouds of optical thickness
$\tau_c\le1$, thermal emission is mainly determined by the single scattering
albedo $\tilde \omega$. The emitted intensity is limb brightened and depends
little on the scattering phase function. For optically thick isothermal clouds,
with $\tau_c \gg 1$, purely absorbing clouds with $\tilde\omega = 0$ become
perfect blackbodies and emit isotropic Planck intensity. Thick isothermal
clouds with moderate single scattering albedos emit substantially less thermal
radiation than black bodies and the emission depends strongly on the anisotropy

darkening in thick, isothermal, scattering clouds is not due to temperature
gradients, as it is for the Sun. With scattering, nearly vertical radiation

  collaborative Human-AI tasks",,,,,"cs.IR cs.AI cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Artificial Intelligence is being employed by humans to collaboratively solve
complicated tasks for search and rescue, manufacturing, etc. Efficient teamwork
can be achieved by understanding user preferences and recommending different
strategies for solving the particular task to humans. Prior work has focused on
personalization of recommendation systems for relatively well-understood tasks
in the context of e-commerce or social networks. In this paper, we seek to
understand the important factors to consider while designing user-centric
strategy recommendation systems for decision-making. We conducted a
human-subjects experiment (n=60) for measuring the preferences of users with
different personality types towards different strategy recommendation systems.
We conducted our experiment across four types of strategy recommendation
modalities that have been established in prior work: (1) Single strategy
recommendation, (2) Multiple similar recommendations, (3) Multiple diverse
recommendations, (4) All possible strategies recommendations. While these
strategy recommendation schemes have been explored independently in prior work,
our study is novel in that we employ all of them simultaneously and in the
context of strategy recommendations, to provide us an in-depth overview of the
perception of different strategy recommendation systems. We found that certain
personality traits, such as conscientiousness, notably impact the preference
towards a particular type of system (p < 0.01). Finally, we report an
interesting relationship between usability, alignment and perceived
intelligence wherein greater perceived alignment of recommendations with one's
own preferences leads to higher perceived intelligence (p < 0.01) and higher
usability (p < 0.01).

(DACs), as well as field programmable gate array (FPGA) resources of 930,000
logic cells and 4,272 digital signal processing (DSP) slices. While this is
sufficient data converter bandwidth for the readout of 8,000 MKIDs, with a 2
MHz channel-spacing, and a 1 MHz sampling rate (per channel), additional FPGA
resources are needed to perform the DSP needed to process this large number of

costs only one fifth of the ZCU111 while still providing the same logic

between FPGA resources and data converters, allowing the full utilization of
the RF bandwidth provided by the data converters, while also lowering the cost

with the ZCU111, to EUR1 per pixel.

monocrystalline superlattice Bragg mirror of excellent purity (background

epitaxy. To recover the refractive indices over such a broad wavelength range,
we fit a dispersion model for each material. In a novel combination of
well-established methods, we measure both a photometrically accurate
transmittance spectrum of the Bragg mirror via Fourier-transform infrared
spectrometry and the individual physical layer thicknesses of the structure via
scanning electron microscopy. To infer the uncertainty of the refractive index
values, we estimate relevant measurement uncertainties and propagate them via a
Monte-Carlo method. This highly-adaptable approach conclusively yields
propagated relative uncertainties on the order of $10^{-4}$ over the measured
spectral range for both GaAs and Al$_{0.929}$Ga$_{0.071}$As. The fitted model
can also approximate the refractive index for MBE-grown
Al$_\mathrm{x}$Ga$_\mathrm{1-x}$As for $0\leq x \leq 1$. Both these updated

device such as an ASIC, FPGA, or CPU without also affecting the instantaneous
supply voltage and compromising the operation of the device [21]. For decades
designers have relied on rough estimates of dynamic load currents that
stimulate a designed Power Delivery Network (PDN). The consequences of
inaccurate load-current characterization can range from excessive PDN cost and
lengthened development schedules to poor performance or functional failure.
This paper will introduce and describe a method to precisely determine
timedomain current waveforms from a pair of measured timedomain voltage
waveforms. This NonInvasive Current Estimation (NICE) method is based on
established twoport network theory along with component and board modeling
techniques that have been validated through measurements on demonstrative
circuits. This paper will show that the NICE method works for any transient
event that can be captured on a digital oscilloscope. Limitations of the method
and underlying measurements are noted where appropriate. The method is applied
to a simple PDN with an arbitrary load, and the NICE-derived current waveform
is verified against an independent measurement by sense resistor. With careful
component and board modeling, it is possible to calculate current waveforms
with a root mean square error of less than five percent compared to the
reference measurement. Current transients that were previously difficult or
impossible to characterize by any means can now be calculated and displayed
within seconds of an oscilloscope-trigger event by using NICE. ASIC and FPGA
manufacturers can now compute the startup current for their device and publish
the actual waveform, or provide a piecewiselinear SPICE model (PWL source) to
facilitate design and testing of the regulator and PDN required to support
their device.

understandable. This is particularly important in sensitive contexts like in
the medical domain. We propose a use case study, for skin lesion diagnosis,
illustrating how it is possible to provide the practitioner with explanations
on the decisions of a state of the art deep neural network classifier trained
to characterize skin lesions from examples. Our framework consists of a trained
classifier onto which an explanation module operates. The latter is able to
offer the practitioner exemplars and counterexemplars for the classification
diagnosis thus allowing the physician to interact with the automatic diagnosis
system. The exemplars are generated via an adversarial autoencoder. We
illustrate the behavior of the system on representative examples.

  Recognition System",,,,,"cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Compiler optimization level recognition can be applied to vulnerability
discovery and binary analysis. Due to the exists of many different compilation
optimization options, the difference in the contents of the binary file is very
complicated. There are thousands of compiler optimization algorithms and
multiple different processor architectures, so it is very difficult to manually
analyze binary files and recognize its compiler optimization level with rules.
This paper first proposes a CNN-based compiler optimization level recognition
model: BinEye. The system extracts semantic and structural differences and
automatically recognize the compiler optimization levels. The model is designed
to be very suitable for binary file processing and is easy to understand. We
built a dataset containing 80,028 binary files for the model training and
testing. Our proposed model achieves an accuracy of over 97%. At the same time,
BinEye is a fully CNN-based system and it has a faster forward calculation
speed, at least 8 times faster than the normal RNN-based model. Through our
analysis of the model output, we successfully found the difference in assembly
codes caused by the different compiler optimization level. This means that the
model we proposed is interpretable. Based on our model, we propose a method to
analyze the code differences caused by different compiler optimization levels,
which has great guiding significance for analyzing closed source compilers and
binary security analysis.

  Communications","24 pages, 11 figures, DesignCon 2012",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Complex digital systems such as high performance computers (HPCs) make
extensive use of high-speed electrical interconnects, in routing signals among
processing elements, or between processing elements and memory. Despite
increases in serializer/deserializer (SerDes) and memory interface speeds,
there is demand for higher bandwidth busses in constrained physical spaces
which still mitigate simultaneous switching noise (SSN). The concept of zero
sum signaling utilizes coding across a data bus to allow the use of
single-ended buffers while still mitigating SSN, thereby reducing the number of
physical channels (e.g. circuit board traces) by nearly a factor of two when
compared with traditional differential signaling. Through simulation and
analysis of practical (non-ideal) data bus and power delivery network
architectures, we demonstrate the feasibility of zero sum signaling and compare
performance with that of traditional (single-ended and differential) methods.

  ML4Systems",,,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Finding the best way to schedule operations in a computation graph is a
classical NP-hard problem which is central to compiler optimization. However,
evaluating the goodness of a schedule on the target hardware can be very
time-consuming. Traditional approaches as well as previous machine learning
ones typically optimize proxy metrics, which are fast to evaluate but can lead
to bad schedules when tested on the target hardware. In this work, we propose a
new approach to scheduling by sampling proportionally to the proxy metric using
a novel GFlowNet method. We introduce a technique to control the trade-off
between diversity and goodness of the proposed schedules at inference time and
demonstrate empirically that the pure optimization baselines can lead to subpar
performance with respect to our approach when tested on a target model.
Furthermore, we show that conditioning the GFlowNet on the computation graph
enables generalization to unseen scheduling problems for both synthetic and
real-world compiler datasets.

conductor, and specifically the old rule-of-thumb that charge accumulates near
sharp points and more generally in regions of high curvature. The discussion is
almost entirely qualitative. Various conductors with different geometric shapes
have been considered and the charge density on their points has been compared.
Our discussion shows that the statement ""surface charge density is higher at
points with greater curvature"" does not seem to be true and at least it can be
modified. We have avoided unnecessary relationships as much as possible and
tried to follow the discussion qualitatively.

polynomials that annihilate all elements of the ring) over general commutative

natural projection maps the ring of polynomials to the ring of polynomial
functions. We present a new approach to finding the generating set of this
ideal over the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ of residue classes modulo $n$.
Generalizing this approach, we partially classify the vanishing polynomials
over any general commutative ring with identity. We also establish a bijection
between vanishing polynomials and polynomial functions over product rings and
those of their constituent rings. Finally, we find some restrictions on how
many roots polynomials can have over certain finite commutative rings.

fiber weave skew) both through simulation and through measurement of a wide
range of structures on a PCB test vehicle. We demonstrate that conventional
approaches in many cases will not be sufficient, but that modest

printed circuit board (PCB) physical stripline and via models, followed by
channel modeling and link simulation. We invert this simulation flow by first
creating link performance curves across an array of hypothetical channels
defined with specially-developed, high level, equation-based models; limited
physical extraction is later undertaken to relate PCB channel implementation to
these performance curves. These curves allow us to determine the system-level
SerDes channel requirements and to become better informed in choosing PCB
technologies for lower cost and easier manufacturability. The inverted modeling
process is very efficient, allowing for the rapid identification and avoidance
of problematic channel topologies and the study of other potentially useful
channel designs.

that the use of high layer-count boards with PTH technology are viable for
emerging 112 Gb/s PAM-4 links.

balanced or nearly-balanced coding to reduce simultaneous switching noise (SSN)

While several balanced coding schemes are known, few papers exist that describe
the necessary digital hardware implementations of (known) balanced coding
schemes, and no algorithms had previously been developed for nearly-balanced
coding. In this work, we extend a known balanced coding scheme to accommodate
nearly-balanced coding and demonstrate a range of coding and decoding circuits
through synthesis in 65 nm CMOS. These hardware implementations have minimal
impact on the energy efficiency and area when compared to current
serializer/deserializers (SerDes) at clock rates which would support SerDes
integration.

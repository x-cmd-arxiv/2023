Bohr, whose interpretation in its ultimate forms (as he changes his
interpretation a few times) is an RWR interpretation, but who does not appear

articles follows Bohr's interpretation, as based on two assumptions or
postulates, the Heisenberg and Bohr postulates, but it adds a third postulate,
the Dirac postulate. The article also introduces, in conjunction with the

new interest in the use of Controller Area Network (CAN) for multi-module,
plug-and-play bus support for their embedded systems. CAN systems provide a
variety of benefits that can outweigh typical conventional wire-loom protocols
in many categories. However, implementation of CAN also brings forth
vulnerabilities provided by its spoofable, destination-encoded shared
communication bus. These vulnerabilities result in undetectable fault
injection, packet manipulation, unauthorized packet logging/sniffing, and more.
They also provide attackers the capability to manipulate all sensor
information, commands, and create unsafe operating conditions using only a
single compromised node on the CAN network (bypassing all root-of-trust in the
modules). Thus, malicious hardware requires only a connection to the bus for
access to all traffic. In this paper, we discuss the effects of repurposed
CAN-based attacks capable of manipulating sensor data, overriding systems, and
injecting dangerous commands on the Controller Area Network using various entry
methods. As a case study, we also showed a spoofing attack on critical data
modules within a commercial 3D printer.

between the coordinate and momentum operators with the creation and
annihilation operators which allowed us to obtain the expressions of the
partition function, the condensation temperature, and the ground state

increases with increasing {\theta} value. In the blackbody radiation phenomena,
we found how the Dunkl formalism modifies total radiated energy. Then, we
examined the thermal quantities of the system. We found that the Dunkl
deformation causes an increase in entropy and specific heat functions as well
as in the total radiation energy. However, we observed a decrease in the
Dunk-corrected Helmholtz free energy in this scenario. Finally, we found that
the equation of state is invariant even in the considered formalism.

\textit{multivariate Vandermonde with Arnoldi (V+A) method}, which is based on
least-squares approximation together with a Stieltjes orthogonalization
process, for approximating continuous, multivariate functions on
$d$-dimensional irregular domains. The V+A method addresses the
ill-conditioning of the Vandermonde approximation by creating a set of discrete
orthogonal basis with respect to a discrete measure. The V+A method is simple
and general. It relies only on the sample points from the domain and requires
no prior knowledge of the domain. In this paper, we first analyze the sample
complexity of the V+A approximation. In particular, we show that, for a large
class of domains, the V+A method gives a well-conditioned and near-optimal
$N$-dimensional least-squares approximation using $M=\mathcal{O}(N^2)$
equispaced sample points or $M=\mathcal{O}(N^2\log N)$ random sample points,
independently of $d$. We also give a comprehensive analysis of the error
estimates and rate of convergence of the V+A approximation. Based on the
multivariate V+A approximation, we propose a new variant of the weighted V+A
least-squares algorithm that uses only $M=\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ sample points

presents an optimal production scheduling approach for utility-scale P2H plants
composed of multiple alkaline electrolyzers. Unlike existing works, this work
discards the conservative constant steady-state constraints and first leverages
the dynamic thermal and hydrogen-to-oxygen (HTO) impurity crossover processes
of electrolyzers. Doing this optimizes their effects on the loading range and
energy conversion efficiency, therefore improving the load flexibility of P2H
production. The proposed multiphysics-aware scheduling model is formulated as
mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). It coordinates the electrolyzers'
operation state transitions and load allocation subject to comprehensive
thermodynamic and mass transfer constraints. A decomposition-based solution
method, SDM-GS-ALM, is followingly adopted to address the scalability issue for
scheduling large-scale P2H plants composed of tens of electrolyzers. With an
experiment-verified dynamic electrolyzer model, case studies up to 22
electrolyzers show that the proposed method remarkably improves the hydrogen
output and profit of P2H production powered by either solar or wind energy

framework highlights a delicate interplay among the teacher's accuracy, the
student's margin with respect to the teacher predictions, and the complexity of
the teacher predictions. Specifically, it provides a rigorous justification for
the utility of various techniques that are prevalent in the context of
distillation, such as early stopping and temperature scaling. Our analysis
further suggests the use of online distillation, where a student receives
increasingly more complex supervision from teachers in different stages of
their training. We demonstrate efficacy of online distillation and validate the

exponential-time estimators were previously known to achieve this guarantee.
Given $n$ samples from a (sub-)Gaussian distribution with unknown mean $\mu$
and covariance $\Sigma$, our $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-differentially private
estimator produces $\tilde{\mu}$ such that $\|\mu - \tilde{\mu}\|_{\Sigma} \leq
\alpha$ as long as $n \gtrsim \tfrac d {\alpha^2} + \tfrac{d \sqrt{\log

Mahalanobis error metric $\|\mu - \hat{\mu}\|_{\Sigma}$ measures the distance
between $\hat \mu$ and $\mu$ relative to $\Sigma$; it characterizes the error
of the sample mean. Our algorithm runs in time $\tilde{O}(nd^{\omega - 1} +
nd/\varepsilon)$, where $\omega < 2.38$ is the matrix multiplication exponent.
  We adapt an exponential-time approach of Brown, Gaboardi, Smith, Ullman, and
Zakynthinou (2021), giving efficient variants of stable mean and covariance
estimation subroutines that also improve the sample complexity to the nearly
optimal bound above.
  Our stable covariance estimator can be turned to private covariance
estimation for unrestricted subgaussian distributions. With $n\gtrsim d^{3/2}$
samples, our estimate is accurate in spectral norm. This is the first such
algorithm using $n= o(d^2)$ samples, answering an open question posed by Alabi

Frobenius norm. This leads to a fast, nearly optimal algorithm for private

optimization problems, and it has made remarkable progress in recent years
through several subtle mechanisms. In this paper, we found two ways to improve
the local search algorithms in solving Pseudo-Boolean Optimization(PBO):
Firstly, some of those mechanisms such as unit propagation are merely used in
solving MaxSAT before, which can be generalized to solve PBO as well; Secondly,
the existing local search algorithms utilize the heuristic on variables,
so-called score, to mainly guide the search. We attempt to gain more insights
into the clause, as it plays the role of a middleman who builds a bridge
between variables and the given formula. Hence, we first extended the
combination of unit propagation-based decimation algorithm to PBO problem,
giving a further generalized definition of unit clause for PBO problem, and
apply it to the existing solver LS-PBO for constructing an initial assignment;
then, we introduced a new heuristic on clauses, dubbed care, to set a higher
priority for the clauses that are less satisfied in current iterations.
Experiments on three real-world application benchmarks including minimum-width
confidence band, wireless sensor network optimization, and seating arrangement
problems show that our algorithm DeciLS-PBO has a promising performance

  Models",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Assortment optimization has received active explorations in the past few
decades due to its practical importance. Despite the extensive literature
dealing with optimization algorithms and latent score estimation, uncertainty
quantification for the optimal assortment still needs to be explored and is of
great practical significance. Instead of estimating and recovering the complete
optimal offer set, decision-makers may only be interested in testing whether a
given property holds true for the optimal assortment, such as whether they
should include several products of interest in the optimal set, or how many
categories of products the optimal set should include. This paper proposes a
novel inferential framework for testing such properties. We consider the widely
adopted multinomial logit (MNL) model, where we assume that each customer will
purchase an item within the offered products with a probability proportional to
the underlying preference score associated with the product. We reduce
inferring a general optimal assortment property to quantifying the uncertainty
associated with the sign change point detection of the marginal revenue gaps.
We show the asymptotic normality of the marginal revenue gap estimator, and
construct a maximum statistic via the gap estimators to detect the sign change
point. By approximating the distribution of the maximum statistic with
multiplier bootstrap techniques, we propose a valid testing procedure. We also
conduct numerical experiments to assess the performance of our method.

  under negotiated transfer pricing: An agent-based simulation with fuzzy
  Q-learning agents",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper focuses on specific investments under negotiated transfer pricing.
Reasons for transfer pricing studies are primarily to find conditions that
maximize the firm's overall profit, especially in cases with bilateral trading
problems with specific investments. However, the transfer pricing problem has
been developed in the context where managers are fully individual rational
utility maximizers. The underlying assumptions are rather heroic and, in
particular, how managers process information under uncertainty, do not
perfectly match with human decision-making behavior. Therefore, this paper
relaxes key assumptions and studies whether cognitively bounded agents achieve
the same results as fully rational utility maximizers and, in particular,
whether the recommendations on managerial-compensation arrangements and
bargaining infrastructures are designed to maximize headquarters' profit in
such a setting. Based on an agent-based simulation with fuzzy Q-learning
agents, it is shown that in case of symmetric marginal cost parameters, myopic
fuzzy Q-learning agents invest only as much as in the classic hold-up problem,
while non-myopic fuzzy Q-learning agents invest optimally. However, in
scenarios with non-symmetric marginal cost parameters, a deviation from the
previously recommended surplus sharing rules can lead to higher investment
decisions and, thus, to an increase in the firm's overall profit.

Distillation (GPD) to enable effective few-shot face image translation. GPD

that fulfills end-to-end translation. Specifically, we adapt the teacher
network trained on large-scale data in the source domain to the target domain
with only a few samples, where it can learn the target domain's knowledge.
Then, we can achieve few-shot augmentation by generating source domain and
target domain images simultaneously with the same latent codes. We propose an
anchor-based knowledge distillation module that can fully use the difference
between the training and the augmented data to distill the knowledge of the
teacher network into the student network. The trained student network achieves
excellent generalization performance with the absorption of additional

(CSE) in the system of massless fermions is given by topological expression.
Interactions might change the pattern drastically. However, we prove that the
CSE conductivity is still given by the topological invariant composed of the
Green functions at zero temperature as long as the chiral symmetry is present,
and if the renormalized axial current is considered. This allows to predict its
appearance with the standard value of conductivity per Dirac fermion
$\sigma_{CSE} = \frac{1}{2 \pi^2}$ in quark - gluon matter at $T = 0$ and
sufficiently large baryon chemical potential, in the hypothetical phase with
restored chiral symmetry and without color superconductivity. This phase may be
realized inside the neutron stars. We also argue that the same topological
expression for the CSE may be observed in Weyl semimetals, which realize the
system of interacting relativistic fermions in solid state systems. In order to
estimate the non - perturbative corrections to $\sigma_{CSE}$ within QCD at
finite temperatures we apply method of field correlators developed by
Yu.A.Simonov. As expected, above the deconfinement crossover the topological
expression is approached within the quark - gluon plasma phase, when the quark
chemical potential is sufficiently large. However, we observe that this occurs
only when quark chemical potential is much larger than the thermal (Debye)

state wherein the atomistic dynamics of a liquid becomes heterogeneous and

temperature-dependent at temperatures below $T_{A}$. The theoretical estimation
of this temperature is difficult for some types of materials, especially
silicates and borates. In these materials, self-diffusion as a function of the
temperature $T$ is reproduced by the Arrhenius law, where the activation
barrier practically independent on the temperature $T$. The purpose of the
present work was to establish the relationship between the Arrhenius crossover
temperature $T_{A}$ and the physical properties of liquids directly related to
their glass-forming ability. Using a machine learning model, the crossover
temperature $T_{A}$ was calculated for silicates, borates, organic compounds
and metal melts of various compositions. The empirical values of the glass
transition temperature $T_{g}$, the melting temperature $T_{m}$, the ratio of
these temperatures $T_{g}/T_{m}$ and the fragility index $m$ were applied as
input parameters. It has been established that the temperatures $T_{g}$ and
$T_{m}$ are significant parameters, whereas their ratio $T_{g}/T_{m}$ and the
fragility index $m$ do not correlate much with the temperature $T_{A}$. An
important result of the present work is the analytical equation relating the
temperatures $T_{g}$, $T_{m}$ and $T_{A}$, and that, from the algebraic point

this equation allows one to correctly estimate the temperature $T_{A}$ for a

~0.21 Wm-1K-1 at 300 K) with extremely weak temperature dependence following
~T-0.45, in sharp contrast to the conventionally predicted ~T-1 dependence.
Particularly, we find that the vibrational properties of Cs2AgBiBr6 are
featured by strong anharmonicity and wave-like tunnelling of phonons. On one
hand, anharmonic phonon renormalization from both the cubic and quartic
anharmonicities are essential in precisely predicting the experimentally
measured phase transition temperature in Cs2AgBiBr6. On the other hand, the
thermal conductivity contribution of the wavelike tunnelling channel surpasses
that of the particle-like propagation channel above around 340 K, indicating
the breakdown of the particle-like phonon picture conventionally used in the
Peierls-Boltzmann Transport Equation (PBTE). Importantly, for thermal transport
in Cs2AgBiBr6, considering only three-phonon or both three- and four-phonon
scattering processes in phonon scattering rates will result in completely
different heat conductance mechanisms, revealing the importance of four-phonon

effective Hamiltonians in intracavity situations. However, the James' approach
does work in the case of only two-photon transitions in a cavity. A
generalization of the James' approach works in the case of three-photon
transitions in a cavity, but only under Raman-like resonant conditions. Another
important approach for adiabatic elimination is based on an adaptation of the
Markov approximation well-known in the theory of system-bath interactions.
However, this approach has not been shown to work in intracavity situations. In
this paper, we present a method of adiabatic elimination for atoms inside
cavities in the presence of multiphoton transitions. We work in the Heisenberg
picture, and our approach has the advantage that it allows one to derive
effective Hamiltonians even when Raman-like resonance conditions do not hold.

representations that aid the performance of downstream tasks. However, recent
studies showed that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks involving node
injection and network perturbation. Among these, node injection attacks are
more practical as they don't require manipulation in the existing network and
can be performed more realistically. In this paper, we propose a novel problem
statement - a class-specific poison attack on graphs in which the attacker aims
to misclassify specific nodes in the target class into a different class using
node injection. Additionally, nodes are injected in such a way that they
camouflage as benign nodes. We propose NICKI, a novel attacking strategy that
utilizes an optimization-based approach to sabotage the performance of
GNN-based node classifiers. NICKI works in two phases - it first learns the
node representation and then generates the features and edges of the injected
nodes. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on four benchmark networks
show that NICKI is consistently better than four baseline attacking strategies
for misclassifying nodes in the target class. We also show that the injected
nodes are properly camouflaged as benign, thus making the poisoned graph
indistinguishable from its clean version w.r.t various topological properties.

classification (and regression) tasks in energy markets lead to highly
imbalanced training data. Say, to balance reserves, it is natural for market
regulators to have a choice to be more/less averse to false negatives (can lead
to poor operating efficiency and costs) than to false positives (can lead to
market shortfall). Besides accuracy, other metrics like algorithmic bias, RMBE

filtering assertions through dynamic test executions and mutation testing.
Although powerful, such techniques are computationally expensive due to a large
number of assertions, test cases and mutated versions that need to be executed.
To overcome this issue, we demonstrate that a small subset, i.e., 12.95% of the
mutants used by mutation testing tools is sufficient for assertion inference,
this subset is significantly different, i.e., 71.59% different from the
subsuming mutant set that is frequently cited by mutation testing literature,
and can be statically approximated through a learning based method. In
particular, we propose AIMS, an approach that selects Assertion Inferring
Mutants, i.e., a set of mutants that are well-suited for assertion inference,
with 0.58 MCC, 0.79 Precision, and 0.49 Recall. We evaluate AIMS on 46 programs
and demonstrate that it has comparable inference capabilities with full
mutation analysis (misses 12.49% of assertions) while significantly limiting
execution cost (runs 46.29 times faster). A comparison with randomly selected
sets of mutants, shows the superiority of AIMS by inferring 36% more assertions
while requiring approximately equal amount of execution time. We also show that
AIMS 's inferring capabilities are almost complete as it infers 96.15% of
ground truth assertions, (i.e., a complete set of assertions that were manually
constructed) while Random Mutant Selection infers 19.23% of them. More
importantly, AIMS enables assertion inference techniques to scale on subjects
where full mutation testing is prohibitively expensive and Random Mutant

performance of the overall switched system. Specifically, the learning
experience from the previous active duration of a subsystem is retained in the
memory and reused when the subsystem is inactive and when the subsystem becomes
active again. Parameter convergence is shown based on an intermittent initial
excitation (IIE), which is significantly relaxed than the classical persistence
of excitation (PE) condition. A common Lyapunov function is considered to
ensure closed-loop stability with S-MRAC. Further under IIE, the exponential
stability of tracking and parameter estimation error dynamics are guaranteed.

in many countries as obesity rises. Sufficient, effective treatment of OSA
entails high social and financial costs for healthcare. Objective: For
treatment purposes, predicting OSA patients' visit expenses for the coming year
is crucial. Reliable estimates enable healthcare decision-makers to perform
careful fiscal management and budget well for effective distribution of
resources to hospitals. The challenges created by scarcity of high-quality
patient data are exacerbated by the fact that just a third of those data from
OSA patients can be used to train analytics models: only OSA patients with more
than 365 days of follow-up are relevant for predicting a year's expenditures.
Methods and procedures: The authors propose a method applying two Transformer
models, one for augmenting the input via data from shorter visit histories and
the other predicting the costs by considering both the material thus enriched
and cases with more than a year's follow-up. Results: The two-model solution
permits putting the limited body of OSA patient data to productive use.
Relative to a single-Transformer solution using only a third of the
high-quality patient data, the solution with two models improved the prediction
performance's $R^{2}$ from 88.8% to 97.5%. Even using baseline models with the
model-augmented data improved the $R^{2}$ considerably, from 61.6% to 81.9%.
Conclusion: The proposed method makes prediction with the most of the available
high-quality data by carefully exploiting details, which are not directly
relevant for answering the question of the next year's likely expenditure.

is a query-based Mask Transformer model with the output of multi-organ and
multi-tumor semantic segmentation. We decouple the object queries into organ

cancers and occurring non-cancer tumors (all are pathology-confirmed with 3D
tumor masks annotated by radiologists). On the test set of 631 patients, UniT
has demonstrated strong performance under a set of clinically relevant

diffusion MRI when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is very low, as in the
spinal cord. The accuracy of conventional maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE)
depends highly on initialisation. Unfavourable choices could result in
suboptimal parameter estimates. Current methods to address this issue, such as
grid search (GS) can increase computation time substantially. Methods: We
propose a machine learning (ML) informed MLE approach that combines
conventional MLE with ML approaches synergistically. ML-based methods have been
developed recently to improve the speed and precision of parameter estimation.
However, they can generate high systematic bias in estimated parameters when
SNR is low. In the proposed ML-MLE approach, an artificial neural network model
is trained to provide sensible initialisation for MLE efficiently, with the
final solution determined by MLE, avoiding biases typically affecting pure ML
estimations. Results: Using parameter estimation of neurite orientation
dispersion and density imaging as an example, simulation and in vivo
experiments suggest that the ML-MLE method can reduce outlier estimates from
conventional MLE in white matter voxels affected by CSF contamination. It also
accelerates computation compared to GS-MLE. Conclusion: The ML-MLE method can

chambers (TPCs) can detect electronic and nuclear recoils with energy down to
kilo-electron volts (keV). In this paper, we characterize the response of a
single-phase liquid xenon proportional scintillation counter (LXePSC), which
produces electroluminescence directly in the liquid, to detect electronic
recoils at low energies. Our design uses a thin (10 - 25 $\mu$m diameter),
central anode wire in a cylindrical LXe target where ionization electrons,
created from radiation particles, drift radially towards the anode, and
electroluminescence is produced. Both the primary scintillation (S1) and
electroluminescence (S2) are detected by photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)
surrounding the LXe target. Up to 17 photons are produced per electron,
obtained with a 10 $\mu$m diameter anode wire, allowing for the highly
efficient detection of electronic recoils from beta decays of a tritium source
down to roughly 1 keV. Single electrons, from photo-emission of the cathode
wires, are observed at a gain of 1.8 photoelectrons (PE) per electron. The
delayed signals following the S2 signals are dominated by single-photon-like
hits, without evidence for electron signals observed in the two-phase xenon
TPCs. We discuss the potential application of such a LXePSC for reactor
neutrino detection via Coherent Elastic Neutrino Nucleus Scattering
(CE$\nu$NS).

Furthermore, it is the only one observed species to share the branched atomic

chemical reactions are examined in detail using density functional theory,
second order M{\phi}ller Plesset perturbation theory, coupled cluster methods,

reported for the formation of propyl-cyanide (n-PrCN) and its branched isomer
(iso-PrCN) from the gas phase association and surface reactions of radicals on
a 34-water model ice cluster. We identify two and three paths for the formation
of iso-PrCN, and n-PrCN respectively. The reaction mechanism involves the
following radicals association: CH3CHCH3+CN, CH3+CH3CHCN for iso-PrCN formation
and CH3CH2+CH2CN, CH3+CH2CH2CN, CN+CH3CH2CH2 leading to n-PrCN formation. We
employ the M062X/6-311++G(d,p) DFT functional and MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ for reactions
on the ice model, and gas phase respectively to optimize the structures,
compute minimum energy paths and zero-point vibrational energies of all
reaction mechanisms. In gas phase, the energetics of the five reactions are
also calculated using the explicitly correlated cluster ab initio methods
(CCSD(T)-F12). All reaction paths are exoergic and barrier-less in gas phase
and on the ice-model suggesting that the formation of iso-PrCN and n-PrCN is
efficient on the water-ice model adopted in this paper. The gas phase formation
of iso-PrCN and n-PrCN however requires a third body or spontaneous emission of
a photon in order to stabilize the molecules.

on, slow down and ultimately lead to freeze out. Together these freeze out
processes comprise the epoch of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). The relics
emerging from this early time include the light element abundances, for example
of helium and deuterium, and a background of decoupled neutrinos, a ""C$\nu$B"" ,

Consequently, BBN has emerged as a key tool for constraining new,
beyond-standard-model (BSM) physics. BBN may become an even finer probe of BSM
physics, given the anticipated higher precision in measurements of the
primordial abundances of deuterium and helium afforded by the advent of large

approaches, (i) mechanical rotation and (ii) twist-stacking, based on
controlled vacuum filtration and do not involve any sophisticated
nanofabrication processes. We used a racemic mixture of CNTs as the starting
material, so the intrinsic chirality of chiral CNTs is not responsible for the
observed chirality. In particular, by controlling the stacking angle and
handedness in (ii), we were able to maximize the CD response and achieve a
record-high deep-ultraviolet ellipticity of 40 $\pm$ 1 mdeg/nm. Our theoretical
simulations using the transfer matrix method reproduce the salient features of
the experimentally observed CD spectra and further predict that a film of

airspeeds over a large sweep of propeller angles of attack. Wind tunnel tests
with the vehicle prototype cover a suite of hover, transition and cruise flight
conditions. Net aerodynamic forces and moments are distinctly computed and
compared for plane, quadrotor and hybrid flight modes. Coefficient-based models
are developed. Polynomial curve fits accurately capture observed data over all
test configurations. To our knowledge, the presented wind tunnel experimental
analysis for a multi-mode eVTOL platform is novel. Increased drag and reduced
dynamic thrust likely due to flow interactions will be important to address in

one of the two approaches: trigger inversion (aka. reverse engineer) and weight
analysis (aka. model diagnosis). In particular, the gradient-based trigger
inversion is considered to be among the most effective backdoor detection
techniques, as evidenced by the TrojAI competition, Trojan Detection Challenge
and backdoorBench. However, little has been done to understand why this
technique works so well and, more importantly, whether it raises the bar to the
backdoor attack. In this paper, we report the first attempt to answer this
question by analyzing the change rate of the backdoored model around its
trigger-carrying inputs. Our study shows that existing attacks tend to inject
the backdoor characterized by a low change rate around trigger-carrying inputs,
which are easy to capture by gradient-based trigger inversion. In the meantime,
we found that the low change rate is not necessary for a backdoor attack to
succeed: we design a new attack enhancement called \textit{Gradient Shaping}
(GRASP), which follows the opposite direction of adversarial training to reduce
the change rate of a backdoored model with regard to the trigger, without
undermining its backdoor effect. Also, we provide a theoretic analysis to
explain the effectiveness of this new technique and the fundamental weakness of
gradient-based trigger inversion. Finally, we perform both theoretical and
experimental analysis, showing that the GRASP enhancement does not reduce the
effectiveness of the stealthy attacks against the backdoor detection methods
based on weight analysis, as well as other backdoor mitigation methods without
using detection.

the first example that the structure of hydride CaBH$_5$ predicted above 280

modulating the charge transfer from metal atoms to hydrogen atoms via the
replacement of Ca with alkali metal atoms e.g. Cs, in which the [BH$_5$]$^{2-}$

to hydrogen Fuel Cells (FCs), which have a wide variety of applications, from
utility power stations to laptops. The Multi-stack Fuel Cell System (MFCS),
which is an assembly of FC stacks, can be a remedy for obstacles in high-power
applications. However, the output voltage of FC stacks varies dramatically
under variable load conditions; hence, in order for MFCS to be efficiently
operated and guarantee an appropriate load-current sharing among the FC stacks,
advanced converter controllers for power conditioning need to be designed. An
accurate circuit model is essential for controller design, which accounts for
the fact that the parameters of some converter components may change due to
aging and repetitive stress in long-term operations. Existing control
frameworks and parametric and non-parametric system identification techniques
do not consider the aforementioned challenges. Thus, this paper investigates
the potential of a data-driven method that, without system identification,
directly implements control on paralleled converters using raw data. Based on
pre-collected input/output trajectories, a non-parametric representation of the
overall circuit is produced for implementing predictive control. While
approaching equal current sharing within the MFCS, the proposed method
considers the minimization of load-following error and mitigation of
circulating current between the converters. Simulation results verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

On the other hand, two-fluid behaviors have been observed in many materials,
suggesting coexistence of local and itinerant f-electrons over a broad
temperature range but lacking a microscopic theoretical description. To
elucidate this fundamental issue, here we propose an exactly solvable
Kondo-Heisenberg model in which the spins are defined in the momentum space and
the k-space Kondo interaction corresponds to a highly nonlocal spin scattering
in the coordinate space. Its solution reveals a continuous evolution of the
Fermi surfaces with Kondo interaction and two-fluid behaviors similar to those
observed in real materials. The electron density violates the usual Luttinger's
theorem, but follows a generalized one allowing for partially enlarged Fermi
surfaces due to partial Kondo screening in the momentum space. Our results
highlight the consequence of nonlocal Kondo interaction relevant for strong
quantum fluctuation regions, and provide important insight into the microscopic

active region 12371 which produced an M6.5 flare. The first simulation is a
full data-driven simulation where the initial condition is given by a nonlinear
force-free field (NLFFF). This NLFFF was extrapolated from photospheric
magnetograms approximately 1 hour prior to the flare, and then a time-varying
photospheric magnetic field is imposed at the bottom surface. The second
simulation is also a data-driven simulation, but it stops driving at the bottom
before the time of flare onset and then switches to the data-constrained
simulation, where the horizontal component of the magnetic field varies
according to an induction equation while the normal component is fixed with
time. Both simulations lead to an eruption, with both simulations producing
highly twisted field lines before the eruption which were not found in the
NLFFF alone. After the eruption, the first simulation based on the time-varying
photospheric magneitic field, continues to produce sheared field lines after
the flare without reproducing phenomena such as post-flare loops. The second
simulation reproduces the phenomena associated with flares well. However in
this case the evolution of the bottom magnetic field is inconsistent with the
evolution of the observed magnetic field. In this letter, we report potential
advantages and disadvantages in data-constrained and data-driven MHD
simulations that need to be taken into consideration by future studies.

included data from 515 COVID-19 patients (Cohort1: 415, cohort2: 100) from the
two centers between January 2020 and July 2020. A deep learning method was
developed to extract the myocardium and visceral pericardium from chest CTs,

segmentation was achieved according to a published method. Radiomics features
of both EAT and lung were extracted for the severity prediction. In a
derivation cohort (290, cohort1), univariate analysis and Pearson correlation
analysis were used to identify predictors of the severity of COVID-19. A
generalized linear regression model for detecting the severity of COVID-19 was
built in a derivation cohort and evaluated in internal (125, cohort1) and
external (100, cohort2) validation cohorts. Results: For EAT extraction, the
Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) of the two centers were 0.972 (0.011) and
0.968 (0.005), respectively. For severity detection, the AUC, net
reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement
(IDI) of the model with radiomics features of both lung and EAT increased by
0.09 (p<0.001), 22.4%, and 17.0%, respectively, compared with the model with

the core-weak mode with a time scale of 3 to 14 periods. It starts with an
intensity brightening at the trailing phase of the core component, and then the
core intensity declines to a very low level, as if the core component is
drifting out from the normal radiation window within one or two periods. Then
the intensity for the trailing components is enhanced, and then the leading
component appears at an advanced phase. Such a core-weak mode lasts for several
periods. Finally, the core-weak mode ends up with an enhanced intensity at the
leading phase for the core component, as if the core gradually comes back and

mobile software. Although previous researchers have designed some methods to
identify the conflict between app behavior and privacy policies, little is
known about investigating regulation requirements for third-party libraries
(TPLs). The regulators enacted multiple regulations to regulate the usage of
personal information for TPLs (e.g., the ""California Consumer Privacy Act""
requires businesses clearly notify consumers if they share consumers' data with
third parties or not). However, it remains challenging to analyze the legality
of TPLs due to three reasons: 1) TPLs are mainly published on public
repositoriesinstead of app market (e.g., Google play). The public repositories
do not perform privacy compliance analysis for each TPL. 2) TPLs only provide
independent functions or function sequences. They cannot run independently,
which limits the application of performing dynamic analysis. 3) Since not all
the functions of TPLs are related to user privacy, we must locate the functions
of TPLs that access/process personal information before performing privacy
compliance analysis. To overcome the above challenges, in this paper, we
propose an automated system named ATPChecker to analyze whether the Android
TPLs meet privacy-related regulations or not. Our findings remind developers to
be mindful of TPL usage when developing apps or writing privacy policies to

lead to the disintegration of a large network into many disconnected tiny
subnetworks. The network dismantling task focuses on how to efficiently select
the least such critical nodes. Most existing approaches focus on measuring
nodes' importance from either functional or topological viewpoint. Different
from theirs, we argue that nodes' importance can be measured from both of the
two complementary aspects: The functional importance can be based on the nodes'
competence in relaying network information; While the topological importance
can be measured from nodes' regional structural patterns. In this paper, we
propose an unsupervised learning framework for network dismantling, called
DCRS, which encodes and fuses both node diffusion competence and role
significance. Specifically, we propose a graph diffusion neural network which
emulates information diffusion for competence encoding; We divide nodes with
similar egonet structural patterns into a few roles, and construct a role graph
on which to encode node role significance. The DCRS converts and fuses the two
encodings to output a final ranking score for selecting critical nodes.
Experiments on both real-world networks and synthetic networks demonstrate that
our scheme significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors for its
mostly requiring much fewer nodes to dismantle a network.

maximal cliques, with each clique representing one candidate object. By making
multiple proposals in the clique to vote for the key frame proposal, we obtain
refined key frame proposals that could be better than any of the single-frame
proposals. A semi-supervised VOS algorithm subsequently tracks these key frame
proposals to the entire video. Our algorithm is modular and hence can be used
with any instance segmentation and semi-supervised VOS algorithm. We achieve

we hide each dimension of the curve in a different frequency, and we perturb a
sliding window sum of the magnitude of that frequency to best match the target

  Prediction",,,,,"cs.AI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The surging demand for high-definition video streaming services and large
neural network models (e.g., Generative Pre-trained Transformer, GPT) implies a
tremendous explosion of Internet traffic. To mitigate the traffic pressure,
architectures with in-network storage have been proposed to cache popular
contents at devices in closer proximity to users. Correspondingly, in order to
maximize caching utilization, it becomes essential to devise an effective
popularity prediction method. In that regard, predicting popularity with
dynamic graph neural network (DGNN) models achieve remarkable performance.
However, DGNN models still suffer from tackling sparse datasets where most
users are inactive. Therefore, we propose a reformative temporal graph network,
named semantics-enhanced temporal graph network (STGN), which attaches extra
semantic information into the user-content bipartite graph and could better
leverage implicit relationships behind the superficial topology structure. On
top of that, we customize its temporal and structural learning modules to
further boost the prediction performance. Specifically, in order to efficiently
aggregate the diversified semantics that a content might possess, we design a
user-specific attention (UsAttn) mechanism for temporal learning module. Unlike
the attention mechanism that only analyzes the influence of genres on content,
UsAttn also considers the attraction of semantic information to a specific
user. Meanwhile, as for the structural learning, we introduce the concept of
positional encoding into our attention-based graph learning and adopt a
semantic positional encoding (SPE) function to facilitate the analysis of
content-oriented user-association analysis. Finally, extensive simulations

  Spiking Patterns",,,,,"cs.NE cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) use discrete spike sequences to transmit
information, which significantly mimics the information transmission of the
brain. Although this binarized form of representation dramatically enhances the
energy efficiency and robustness of SNNs, it also leaves a large gap between
the performance of SNNs and Artificial Neural Networks based on real values.
There are many different spike patterns in the brain, and the dynamic synergy
of these spike patterns greatly enriches the representation capability.
Inspired by spike patterns in biological neurons, this paper introduces the
dynamic Burst pattern and designs the Leaky Integrate and Fire or Burst (LIFB)
neuron that can make a trade-off between short-time performance and dynamic
temporal performance from the perspective of network information capacity. LIFB
neuron exhibits three modes, resting, Regular spike, and Burst spike. The burst
density of the neuron can be adaptively adjusted, which significantly enriches
the characterization capability. We also propose a decoupling method that can
losslessly decouple LIFB neurons into equivalent LIF neurons, which
demonstrates that LIFB neurons can be efficiently implemented on neuromorphic
hardware. We conducted experiments on the static datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100,
and ImageNet, which showed that we greatly improved the performance of the SNNs
while significantly reducing the network latency. We also conducted experiments
on neuromorphic datasets DVS-CIFAR10 and NCALTECH101 and showed that we
achieved state-of-the-art with a small network structure.

such optimal data collection strategy for policy evaluation involving

an optimal design for weighted least squares estimates in the heteroscedastic
linear bandit setting that reduces the MSE of the value of the target policy.
We then use this formulation to derive the optimal allocation of samples per
action during data collection. We then introduce a novel algorithm SPEED
(Structured Policy Evaluation Experimental Design) that tracks the optimal
design and derive its regret with respect to the optimal design. Finally, we
empirically validate that SPEED leads to policy evaluation with mean squared
error comparable to the oracle strategy and significantly lower than simply
running the target policy.

global warming, (A.G.W), with a minor role for natural trends in temperature.
The I.P.P.C estimates natural temperature (NAT) from climate models and
attributes the difference from recent recorded temperature to A.G.W. We use the
temperature record to assess if trends in temperature are due to NAT or A.G.W
effects. The method requires long records like the 362-year Central England
temperature (C.E.T) record. The C.E.T was divided into a 262 year-long early
part when only NAT was significant, and a 100 year-long later part. The early
part was decomposed into eight components in the spectral range 15 to 257 years
and the components were forward projected to the next 100 years. The projected
NAT replicated the recorded cooling from 1950 to 1980 and the rapid increase
from 1980 to 2010, indicating that the recent strong 50-year trend in C.E.T was
primarily NAT. Based on the small difference between the projected NAT and the
recorded C.E.T a minor role was attributed to A.G.W and a climate sensitivity
to CO2 doubling of 0.7 +/- 0.2 K estimated. Components, at 514 and 1028 years,
were derived from the C.E.T record providing a means for validation of long
projections against proxy records of past temperature. Future projection of
combined NAT and A.G.W indicated a cooling of C.E.T by 0.5 C from now to year
2060 before A.G.W becomes dominant. The possible cause of an imminent decrease
in C.E.T was explored by applying the same method of component estimation to
temperature data from Melbourne, Australia (MET) and the geomagnetic a.a index,
a proxy for the solar wind. Comparing cyclic variations of the a.a index and
the C.E.T and MET data indicated a complex relationship with the strong recent

standard model (SM) with lattice QCD inputs such as $\hat{B}_K$, $|V_{cb}|$,

the standard model with exclusive $|V_{cb}|$ and other lattice QCD inputs
describes only 65% of the experimental value of $|\varepsilon_K|$ and does not
explain its remaining 35%, which leads to a strong tension in $|\varepsilon_K|$
at the $5.1\sigma \sim 3.9\sigma$ level between the SM theory and experiment.
We also find that this tension disappears when we use the inclusive value of
$|V_{cb}|$ obtained using the heavy quark expansion based on the QCD sum rule
approach, although this inclusive tension is small ($\approx 1.4\sigma$) but
keeps increasing as time goes on.

  Level Centrality","EACL 2023 Long paper",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Dialogue summarization aims to condense a given dialogue into a simple and
focused summary text. Typically, both the roles' viewpoints and conversational
topics change in the dialogue stream. Thus how to effectively handle the
shifting topics and select the most salient utterance becomes one of the major
challenges of this task. In this paper, we propose a novel topic-aware
Global-Local Centrality (GLC) model to help select the salient context from all
sub-topics. The centralities are constructed at both the global and local
levels. The global one aims to identify vital sub-topics in the dialogue and
the local one aims to select the most important context in each sub-topic.
Specifically, the GLC collects sub-topic based on the utterance
representations. And each utterance is aligned with one sub-topic. Based on the
sub-topics, the GLC calculates global- and local-level centralities. Finally,
we combine the two to guide the model to capture both salient context and
sub-topics when generating summaries. Experimental results show that our model
outperforms strong baselines on three public dialogue summarization datasets:
CSDS, MC, and SAMSUM. Further analysis demonstrates that our GLC can exactly
identify vital contents from
sub-topics.~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/xnliang98/bart-glc}}

significantly higher computational costs, e.g., can be up to 2048X in
large-scale ensemble tasks. However, we found that the majority of computations
in ensemble methods are redundant. For instance, over 77% of samples in
CIFAR-100 dataset can be correctly classified with only a single ResNet-18
model, which indicates that only around 23% of the samples need an ensemble of
extra models. To this end, we propose an inference efficient ensemble learning
method, to simultaneously optimize for effectiveness and efficiency in ensemble
learning. More specifically, we regard ensemble of models as a sequential
inference process and learn the optimal halting event for inference on a
specific sample. At each timestep of the inference process, a common selector
judges if the current ensemble has reached ensemble effectiveness and halt
further inference, otherwise filters this challenging sample for the subsequent
models to conduct more powerful ensemble. Both the base models and common
selector are jointly optimized to dynamically adjust ensemble inference for
different samples with various hardness, through the novel optimization goals
including sequential ensemble boosting and computation saving. The experiments
with different backbones on real-world datasets illustrate our method can bring
up to 56\% inference cost reduction while maintaining comparable performance to
full ensemble, achieving significantly better ensemble utility than other
baselines. Code and supplemental materials are available at

various healthcare problems that greatly hampered research on developing

methods. To characterize this heterogeneity, we first conceptualize
heterogeneous causal graphs (HCGs) by generalizing the causal graphical model

with an interaction with the treatment are known as moderators. This allows us
to flexibly produce HCGs given different moderators and explicitly characterize
HCEs from the treatment or potential mediators on the outcome. We establish the
theoretical forms of HCEs and derive their properties at the individual level
in both linear and nonlinear models. An interactive structural learning is
developed to estimate the complex HCGs and HCEs with confidence intervals
provided. Our method is empirically justified by extensive simulations and its
practical usefulness is illustrated by exploring causality among psychiatric

This implies that if every non-atomic Borel probability measure $\mu$ is

develop a score-based necessary and sufficient causal structural learning

ever-increasing size of networks, it is crucial to have fast algorithms to
analyze them efficiently. It is a modularity-based greedy algorithm that
divides a network into disconnected communities better over several iterations.
Even in big, dense networks, it is renowned for establishing high-quality
communities. However it can be at least a factor of ten slower than community
discovery techniques that rely on label-propagation, which are generally
extremely fast but obtain communities of lower quality. The researchers have
suggested a number of methods for parallelizing and improving the Louvain
algorithm. To decide which strategy is generally the best fit and which
parameter values produce the highest performance without compromising community
quality, it is critical to assess the performance and accuracy of these
existing approaches. As we implement the single-threaded and multi-threaded

determine the right parameter values. The tolerance between each pass can be
changed to adjust the method's performance. With an initial tolerance of 0.01

the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) third data release
(DR3), comprising 1642 pointings of two square degrees each. We selected nearly
1.5 million main sequence stars with a signal-to-noise ratio larger than ten in
the twelve J-PLUS passbands and available low-resolution (R = 20-80) spectrum
from the blue and red photometers (BP/RP) in Gaia DR3. We compared the
synthetic photometry from BP/RP spectra with the J-PLUS instrumental
magnitudes, after correcting for the magnitude and color terms between both
systems, to obtain an homogeneous photometric solution for J-PLUS. To
circumvent the current limitations in the absolute calibration of the BP/RP
spectra, the absolute color scale was derived using the locus of 109 white
dwarfs closer than 100 pc with a negligible interstellar extinction. Finally,
the absolute flux scale was anchored to the Panoramic Survey Telescope and
Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) photometry in the r band. The precision of
the J-PLUS photometric calibration, estimated from duplicated objects observed
in adjacent pointings and by comparison with the spectro-photometric standard
star GD 153, is ~12 mmag in u, J0378, and J0395; and ~7 mmag in J0410, J0430,
g, J0515, r, J0660, i, J0861, and z. The estimated accuracy in the calibration
along the surveyed area is better than 1% for all the passbands. The Gaia BP/RP
spectra provide a high-quality, homogeneous photometric reference in the
optical range across the full-sky, in spite of their current limitations as an
absolute reference. The calibration method for J-PLUS DR3 reaches an absolute
precision and accuracy of 1% in the twelve optical filters within an area of
3284 square degrees.

requires the data to satisfy the unconfoundedness assumption which is not

how the conclusions might change if assumptions are violated to a certain
degree. In this paper, we propose a new technique for sensitivity analysis
applicable to clusters observational data with a normally distributed or binary
outcome. The proposed methods aim to assess the robustness of estimated
treatment effects in a single study as well as in multiple studies, i.e.,
meta-analysis, against unmeasured confounders. Simulations with various
underlying scenarios were conducted to assess the performance of our methods.
Unlike other existing sensitivity analysis methods, our methods have no
restrictive assumptions on the number of unmeasured confounders or on the
relationship between measured and unmeasured confounders, and do not exclude
possible interactions between measured confounders and the treatment. Our
methods are easy to implement using standard statistical software packages.

DeltaSpec, an approach that combines test generation and dynamic specification
inference to automatically compute commit-relevant specifications from given
commits. We evaluate DeltaSpec on two datasets that include a total of 57
commits (63 classes and 797 methods). We show that commit-relevant assertions
can precisely describe the semantic deltas of code changes, providing a useful
mechanism for validating the behavioural evolution of software. We also show
that DeltaSpec can infer 88% of the manually written commit-relevant assertions

demonstrate that DeltaSpec's inferred assertions are effective to detect
regression faults. More precisely, we show that commit-relevant assertions can

is found that the upper envelope of the A(Li) vs. [Fe/H] diagram varies
significantly with $R_{birth}$, which explains the decrease of Li for
super-metal-rich (SMR) stars because they are non-young stars born in the inner
disk. The upper envelope of Li-$R_{birth}$ plane fits very well with chemical
evolution models by Grisoni et al. for $R_{birth} = 7 - 12$ kpc, outside which
young stars generally lack sufficient time to migrate to the solar
neighborhood. For stars born in the solar neighborhood, the young open clusters
and the upper envelope of field stars with age $<$ 3 Gyr fit well with

foundations (also known as homotopy type theory). That we work predicatively
means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work
is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the
axiom of (countable) choice. Domain theory studies so-called directed complete
posets (dcpos) and Scott continuous maps between them and has applications in
programming language semantics, higher-type computability and topology. A
common approach to deal with size issues in a predicative foundation is to work
with information systems, abstract bases or formal topologies rather than
dcpos, and approximable relations rather than Scott continuous functions. In
our type-theoretic approach, we instead accept that dcpos may be large and work
with type universes to account for this. A priori one might expect that complex
constructions of dcpos result in a need for ever-increasing universes and are
predicatively impossible. We show that such constructions can be carried out in
a predicative setting. We illustrate the development with applications in the
semantics of programming languages: the soundness and computational adequacy of
the Scott model of PCF and Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped
$\lambda$-calculus. We also give a predicative account of continuous and
algebraic dcpos, and of the related notions of a small basis and its rounded
ideal completion. The fact that nontrivial dcpos have large carriers is in fact
unavoidable and characteristic of our predicative setting, as we explain in a
complementary chapter on the constructive and predicative limitations of
univalent foundations. Our account of domain theory in univalent foundations is
fully formalised with only a few minor exceptions. The ability of the proof
assistant Agda to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.

optimisation (BO) and shows that there are situations where the optimal reward
is not achievable if causal knowledge is ignored. While CaBO exploits causal
relations to determine the set of controllable variables to intervene on, it
does not exploit purely observational variables and marginalises them. We show
that, in general, utilising a subset of observational variables as a context to
choose the values of interventional variables leads to lower cumulative
regrets. We propose a general framework of contextual causal Bayesian
optimisation that efficiently searches through combinations of controlled and
contextual variables, known as policy scopes, and identifies the one yielding
the optimum. We highlight the difficulties arising from the application of the
causal acquisition function currently used in CaBO to select the policy scope
in contextual settings and propose a multi-armed bandits based selection
mechanism. We analytically show that well-established methods, such as
contextual BO (CoBO) or CaBO, are not able to achieve the optimum in some
cases, and empirically show that the proposed method achieves sub-linear regret
in various environments and under different configurations.

across a wide range of ecosystems. Analyzing phage proteins is indispensable
for understanding phages' functions and roles in microbiomes. High-throughput
sequencing enables us to obtain phages in different microbiomes with low cost.
However, compared to the fast accumulation of newly identified phages, phage
protein classification remains difficult. In particular, a fundamental need is
to annotate virion proteins, the structural proteins such as major tail,
baseplate etc. Although there are experimental methods for virion protein
identification, they are too expensive or time-consuming, leaving a large
number of proteins unclassified. Thus, there is a great demand to develop a
computational method for fast and accurate phage virion protein classification.
Results: In this work, we adapted the state-of-the-art image classification
model, Vision Transformer, to conduct virion protein classification. By
encoding protein sequences into unique images using chaos gaming
representation, we can leverage Vision Transformer to learn both local and
global features from sequence ``images''. Our method, PhaVIP, has two main
functions: classifying PVP and non-PVP sequences and annotating the types of
PVP, such as capsid and tail. We tested PhaVIP on several datasets with
increasing difficulty and benchmarked it against alternative tools. The
experimental results show that PhaVIP has superior performance. After
validating the performance of PhaVIP, we investigated two applications that can
use the output of PhaVIP: phage taxonomy classification and phage host
prediction. The results show the benefit of using classified proteins rather
than all proteins.

the cubic Sn phase ($\alpha$-Sn), is epitaxial on InSb and presents very low

that gravity deflection enlarges the difference between Majorana and Dirac

important in various fields. The streamflow discharge is one such example that
can be reasonably described as an aggregated stochastic process of randomized

the reversion measure is critical because of its omnipresence in the aggregated
stochastic process. However, the modeling accuracy is commonly limited by the
available real-world data. One approach to this issue is to evaluate the upper
and lower bounds of a statistic of interest subject to ambiguity of the
reversion measure. Here, we use the Tsallis Value-at-Risk (TsVaR) as a convex
risk measure to generalize the widely used entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) as a
sharp statistical indicator. We demonstrate that the EVaR cannot be used for
evaluating key statistics, such as mean and variance, of the streamflow

TsVaR avoids this issue because it requires only the existence of some
polynomial, not exponential moment. As a demonstration, we apply the

we propose an action-aware domain adaptation framework that leverages the prior
knowledge induced from the action recognition task during the adaptation.
Specifically, we disentangle the source features into action-relevant features
and action-irrelevant features using the learned action classifier and then
align the target features with the action-relevant features. To further improve
the action prediction performance, we exploit the verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix to constrain and refine the action predictions. Our final submission
achieved the first place in terms of top-1 action recognition accuracy.

In the SIRS model, each individual is in one of the states susceptible (S),
infected(I) or recovered (R), depending on its state of health. In compartment
R, an individual is assumed to stay immune within a finite time interval only
and then transfers back to the S compartment. We extend the model and allow for
a feedback control of the infection rate by mitigation measures which are
related to the number of infections. A finite response time of the feedback
mechanism is supposed that changes the low-dimensional SIRS model into an
infinite-dimensional set of integro-differential (delay-differential)
equations. It turns out that the retarded feedback renders the originally
stable endemic equilibrium of SIRS (stable focus) into an unstable focus if the
delay exceeds a certain critical value. Nonlinear solutions show persistent
regular oscillations of the number of infected and susceptible individuals. In
the last part we include noise effects from the environment and allow for a
fluctuating infection rate. This results in multiplicative noise terms and our
model turns into a set of stochastic nonlinear integro-differential equations.
Numerical solutions reveal an irregular behavior of repeated disease outbreaks
in the form of infection waves with a variety of frequencies and amplitudes.

identify pedestrian images within an unlabeled target domain with an auxiliary
labeled source-domain dataset. Many existing works attempt to recover reliable
identity information by considering multiple homogeneous networks. And take
these generated labels to train the model in the target domain. However, these
homogeneous networks identify people in approximate subspaces and equally
exchange their knowledge with others or their mean net to improve their
ability, inevitably limiting the scope of available knowledge and putting them
into the same mistake. This paper proposes a Dual-level Asymmetric Mutual
Learning method (DAML) to learn discriminative representations from a broader
knowledge scope with diverse embedding spaces. Specifically, two heterogeneous
networks mutually learn knowledge from asymmetric subspaces through the pseudo
label generation in a hard distillation manner. The knowledge transfer between
two networks is based on an asymmetric mutual learning manner. The teacher
network learns to identify both the target and source domain while adapting to
the target domain distribution based on the knowledge of the student.
Meanwhile, the student network is trained on the target dataset and employs the
ground-truth label through the knowledge of the teacher. Extensive experiments
in Market-1501, CUHK-SYSU, and MSMT17 public datasets verified the superiority
of DAML over state-of-the-arts.

provides one promising method towards faster convergence by splitting a large
model into multiple smaller models. In state-of-the-art blockwise distillation
methods, training is performed block-by-block in a data-parallel manner using
multiple GPUs. To produce inputs for the student blocks, the teacher model is
executed from the beginning until the current block under training. However,
this results in a high overhead of redundant teacher execution, low GPU
utilization, and extra data loading. To address these problems, we propose
Pipe-BD, a novel parallelization method for blockwise distillation. Pipe-BD
aggressively utilizes pipeline parallelism for blockwise distillation,
eliminating redundant teacher block execution and increasing per-device batch
size for better resource utilization. We also extend to hybrid parallelism for
efficient workload balancing. As a result, Pipe-BD achieves significant
acceleration without modifying the mathematical formulation of blockwise

to address the overfitting problem. Among them, leveraging deep learning
approaches to predict patch correctness is emerging along with the available

techniques mainly rely on manually-designed code features, which can be
extremely costly and challenging to construct in practice. In this paper, we
propose APPT, a pre-trained model-based automated patch correctness assessment
technique, which treats the source code as token sequences without extra
overhead to design hand-crafted features. In particular, APPT adopts a
pre-trained model as the encoder stack, followed by an LSTM stack and a deep
learning classifier. Although our idea is general and can be built on various
pre-trained models, we implemente APPT based on the BERT model. We conduct an

achieves prediction accuracy of 79.0% and recall of 81.3%, outperforming the

techniques) compared with existing representation learning techniques. We also
prove that adopting code pre-trained models can further provide substantial
advancement (e.g., GraphCodeBERT-based APPT improves BERT-based APPT by 3.0%

permit the formulation of a manifestly covariant notion of entanglement entropy

(due to Sorkin and Johnston) of a 2-point correlation function for a Gaussian
scalar field from causal set Feynman propagators and Pauli-Jordan functions,
from which an eigendecomposition, and hence an entanglement entropy, can be
computed. In the Wolfram model case, it is given instead in terms of the
Fubini-Study metric on branchial graphs, whose tensor product structure is
inherited functorially from that of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In both
cases, the entanglement entropies in question are most naturally defined over
an extended spacetime region (hence the manifest covariance), in contrast to
the generically non-covariant definitions over single spacelike hypersurfaces
common to most continuum quantum field theories. In this article, we show how
an axiomatic field theory for a free, massless scalar field (obeying the
appropriate bosonic commutation relations) may be rigorously constructed over

geometric transformation. This paper aims to verify the robustness of
large-scale DNNs against the combination of multiple geometric transformations
with a provable guarantee. Given a set of transformations (e.g., rotation,
scaling, etc.), we develop GeoRobust, a black-box robustness analyser built
upon a novel global optimisation strategy, for locating the worst-case
combination of transformations that affect and even alter a network's output.
GeoRobust can provide provable guarantees on finding the worst-case combination
based on recent advances in Lipschitzian theory. Due to its black-box nature,
GeoRobust can be deployed on large-scale DNNs regardless of their
architectures, activation functions, and the number of neurons. In practice,
GeoRobust can locate the worst-case geometric transformation with high
precision for the ResNet50 model on ImageNet in a few seconds on average. We
examined 18 ImageNet classifiers, including the ResNet family and vision
transformers, and found a positive correlation between the geometric robustness
of the networks and the parameter numbers. We also observe that increasing the
depth of DNN is more beneficial than increasing its width in terms of improving
its geometric robustness. Our tool GeoRobust is available at

promising potential in solving various complex optimization problems of
relatively small scales. Nowadays, however, ongoing developments in modern
science and engineering are bringing increasingly grave challenges to the
conventional EC paradigm in terms of scalability. As problem scales increase,
on the one hand, the encoding spaces (i.e., dimensions of the decision vectors)
are intrinsically larger; on the other hand, EC algorithms often require
growing numbers of function evaluations (and probably larger population sizes
as well) to work properly. To meet such emerging challenges, not only does it
require delicate algorithm designs, but more importantly, a high-performance
computing framework is indispensable. Hence, we develop a distributed
GPU-accelerated algorithm library -- EvoX. First, we propose a generalized
workflow for implementing general EC algorithms. Second, we design a scalable
computing framework for running EC algorithms on distributed GPU devices.
Third, we provide user-friendly interfaces to both researchers and
practitioners for benchmark studies as well as extended real-world
applications. To comprehensively assess the performance of EvoX, we conduct a
series of experiments, including: (i) scalability test via numerical
optimization benchmarks with problem dimensions/population sizes up to
millions; (ii) acceleration test via a neuroevolution task with multiple GPU
nodes; (iii) extensibility demonstration via the application to reinforcement
learning tasks on the OpenAI Gym. The code of EvoX is available at

generative graph SSL against other GCL models on both unsupervised and

family of self-supervised variational graph auto-encoder (VGAE). Specifically,
SeeGera adopts the semi-implicit variational inference framework, a
hierarchical variational framework, and mainly focuses on feature
reconstruction and structure/feature masking. On the one hand, SeeGera
co-embeds both nodes and features in the encoder and reconstructs both links
and features in the decoder. Since feature embeddings contain rich semantic
information on features, they can be combined with node embeddings to provide
fine-grained knowledge for feature reconstruction. On the other hand, SeeGera
adds an additional layer for structure/feature masking to the hierarchical
variational framework, which boosts the model generalizability. We conduct
extensive experiments comparing SeeGera with 9 other state-of-the-art
competitors. Our results show that SeeGera can compare favorably against other
state-of-the-art GCL methods in a variety of unsupervised and supervised

have been performed, with respect to a single order parameter, employing the
steady state properties of unconstrained simulation trajectories when barrier

proving that they are actually attained at the symmetric Leibniz algebras.
Then, for an arbitrary critical point $[\mu]$ of $F_n: S_n \rightarrow

nonnegative rationality. Finally, we classify the critical points of $F_n: S_n

Auslander's flatness criterion in this non-Noetherian context. Building on
Gabber--Ramero's upper bound of projective dimensions over Pr\""ufer bases, we
derive an Auslander--Buchsbaum formula, which provides a useful tool for
studying the algebraic structures involved in our work. Through analysis of
reflexive sheaves, we prove various purity theorems for torsors under certain
group algebraic spaces, such as the reductive ones. Specifically, using results
from EGAIV4 on parafactoriality on smooth schemes over normal bases, we prove
the purity for cohomology groups of multiplicative type groups at this level of
generality. Subsequently, we leverage the aforementioned purity results to
resolve the Grothendieck--Serre conjecture for torsors under a quasi-split
reductive group scheme over schemes smooth over Pr\""ufer rings. Along the way,
we also prove a version of the Nisnevich purity conjecture for quasi-split
reductive group schemes in our Pr\""uferian context, inspired by the recent work
by Cesnavicius.

representation of features of text and student linkage between text
representations as character strings and identification of features that embed
connections with underlying phenomena. In order to observe how students reason
with text data in scenarios designed to elicit certain aspects of the domain,
we employed a task-based interview method using a structured protocol with six
pairs of undergraduate students. Our goal was to shed light on students'
understanding of text as data using a motivating task to classify headlines as
""clickbait"" or ""news"". Three types of features (function, content, and form)
surfaced, the majority from the first scenario. Our analysis of the interviews
indicates that this sequence of activities engaged the participants in thinking
at both the human-perception level and the computer-extraction level and
conceptualizing connections between them.

  power grids",,,,,"math.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As variable renewable energy sources comprise a growing share of total
electricity generation, energy storage technologies are becoming increasingly
critical for balancing energy generation and demand.
  In this study, we modeled an existing thermal energy storage unit with
estimated capital costs that are sufficiently low to enable large-scale
deployment in the electric power system. Our analysis emphasizes the value of
using such units to cost-effectively improve renewable energy dispatchability.
This study modeled an existing real-world grid rather than simulating
hypothetical future electric power systems. The storage unit coupled with a
photovoltaic (PV) system was modeled with different storage capacities, whereas
each storage unit size had various discharge capacities.
  The modeling was performed under a baseline case with no emission constraints
and under hypothetical scenarios in which CO$_2$ emissions were reduced. The
results show that power availability increases with increasing storage size and
vastly increases in the hypothetical CO$_2$ reduction scenarios, as the storage
unit is utilized differently. When CO$_2$ emissions are reduced, the power
system must be less dependent on fossil fuel technologies that currently serve
the grid, and thus rely more on the power that is served from the PV + storage
unit.
  The proposed approach can provide increased knowledge to power system
planners regarding how adding PV + storage systems to existing grids can
contribute to the efficient stepwise decarbonization of electric power systems.

  Computing-in-Memory Macro with Software-Analog Co-Design for Transformers","2pages. Under review",,,,"cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Transformer inference requires high compute accuracy; achieving this using
analog CIMs has been difficult due to inherent computational errors. To
overcome this challenge, we propose a Capacitor-Reconfiguring CIM (CR-CIM) to
realize high compute accuracy analog CIM with a 10-bit ADC attaining
high-area/power efficiency. CR-CIM reconfigures its capacitor array to serve
dual purposes: for computation and ADC conversion, achieving significant area
savings. Furthermore, CR-CIMs eliminate signal attenuation by keeping the
signal charge stationary during operation, leading to a 4x improvement in
comparator energy efficiency. We also propose a software-analog co-design
technique integrating majority voting into the 10-bit ADC to dynamically
optimize the CIM noise performance based on the running layer to further save
inference power. Our CR-CIM achieves the highest compute-accuracy for analog
CIMs, and the power efficiency of 818 TOPS/W is competitive with the
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the FoM considering SQNR and CSNR is 2.3x and
1.5x better than previous works, respectively. Vision Transformer (ViT)
inference is achieved and realizes a highest CIFAR10 accuracy of 95.8% for
analog CIMs.

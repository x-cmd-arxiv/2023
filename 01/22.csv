  Federated Learning with Data-Free Hyper-Knowledge Distillation","Accepted by ICLR2023",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Heterogeneity of data distributed across clients limits the performance of
global models trained through federated learning, especially in the settings
with highly imbalanced class distributions of local datasets. In recent years,
personalized federated learning (pFL) has emerged as a potential solution to
the challenges presented by heterogeneous data. However, existing pFL methods
typically enhance performance of local models at the expense of the global
model's accuracy. We propose FedHKD (Federated Hyper-Knowledge Distillation), a
novel FL algorithm in which clients rely on knowledge distillation (KD) to
train local models. In particular, each client extracts and sends to the server
the means of local data representations and the corresponding soft predictions
-- information that we refer to as ``hyper-knowledge"". The server aggregates
this information and broadcasts it to the clients in support of local training.
Notably, unlike other KD-based pFL methods, FedHKD does not rely on a public
dataset nor it deploys a generative model at the server. We analyze convergence
of FedHKD and conduct extensive experiments on visual datasets in a variety of
scenarios, demonstrating that FedHKD provides significant improvement in both
personalized as well as global model performance compared to state-of-the-art
FL methods designed for heterogeneous data settings.

  Characteristics: Effects of pH and Surface-active Agents",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding the behavior of nanobubbles (NBs) in various aqueous solutions
is a challenging task. The present work investigates the effects of various
surfactants (i.e., anionic, cationic, and nonionic) and pH medium on bulk NBs
formation, size, concentration, bubble size distribution (BSD), zeta potential,
and stability. The effect of surfactant was investigated at various
concentrations above and below critical micelle concentrations. NBs were
created in DI water using a piezoelectric transducer. The stability of NBs was
assessed by tracking the change in size and concentration over time. NBs size
is small in the neutral medium compared to the other surfactant or pH mediums.
The size, concentration, BSD, and stability of NBs are strongly influenced by
the zeta potential rather than the solution medium. BSD curve shifts to lower
bubble sizes when the magnitude of zeta potential is high in any solution. NBs
were observed to exist for a long time, either in pure water, surfactant, or pH
solutions. The longevity of NBs is shortened in environments with pH less than
3. Surfactant adsorption on the NBs surface increases with surfactant
concentration up to a certain limit, beyond which it declines considerably. The
Derjaguin-LandauVerwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory was used to interpret the NBs
stability, which resulted in a total potential energy barrier that is positive
and greater than 43.90kBT for pH ranging from 6.0 to 11.0, whereas, for pH
below 6, the potential energy barrier essentially vanishes. Moreover, an effort
has also been made to elucidate the plausible prospect of ion distribution and
its alignment surrounding NBs in cationic and anionic surfactants. The present
research will extend the in-depth investigation of NBs for industrial
applications involving NBs.

extrapolated to a mass resolution comparable to that in a higher-resolution

of long-term, dynamic fairness analysis. Different from previous fairness
notions that are defined purely on observed variables, our notion goes one step
further, capturing behind-the-scenes situation changes on the unobserved latent
causal factors that directly carry out the influence from the current decision
to the future data distribution. Under the specified dynamics, we prove that in
general one cannot achieve the long-term fairness goal only through one-step
interventions. Furthermore, in the effort of approaching long-term fairness, we
consider the mission of ""getting closer to"" the long-term fairness goal and
present possibility and impossibility results accordingly.

we are given a bipartite graph $G=(S,T;E)$ with $S=\{s_1,\dots,s_n\}$, a weight
function on the edges, an integer $d\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ and a degree bound
function $b:S\cup T\to\mathbb{Z}_+$. The goal is to find a maximum-weight
subset $M\subseteq E$ of the edges satisfying the following two conditions: 1)
the degree of each node $v\in S\cup T$ is at most $b(v)$ in $M$, 2) if
$s_it,s_jt\in M$, then $|i-j|\geq d$. In the cyclic version of the problem, the
nodes in $S$ are considered to be in cyclic order. We get back the
\emph{(cyclic) $d$-distance matching problem} when $b(s) = 1$ for $s\in S$ and
$b(t) = \infty$ for $t\in T$.
  We prove that the $d$-distance matching problem is APX-hard even in the
unweighted case. We show that $(2-\frac{1}{d})$ is a tight upper bound on the
integrality gap of the natural integer programming model for the cyclic
$d$-distance $b$-matching problem provided that $(2d-1)$ divides the size of
$S$. For the non-cyclic case, the integrality gap is shown to be at most
$(2-\frac{2}{d})$. The proofs give approximation algorithms with guarantees
matching these bounds, and also improve the best known algorithms for the
(cyclic) $d$-distance matching problem. In a related problem, our goal is to
find a permutation of $S$ maximizing the weight of the optimal $d$-distance
$b$-matching. This problem can be solved in polynomial time for the (cyclic)
$d$-distance matching problem -- even though the (cyclic) $d$-distance matching
problem itself is NP-hard and also hard to approximate arbitrarily. For
(cyclic) $d$-distance $b$-matchings, however, we prove that finding the best
permutation is NP-hard even if $b\equiv 2$ or $d=2$, and we give
$e$-approximation algorithms.

use of iodine as a heavy target. Inelastic dark matter-nucleus scattering is
interesting for studying the properties of dark matter, where many theoretical

dark matter inelastic scattering with the PICO-60 bubble chambers. The analysis
reported here comprises physics runs from PICO-60 bubble chambers using

disfavors various scenarios, in a wide region of parameter space, that provide

emotions towards textual write-ups written and shared by others. This brings
about different interesting domains for analysis; emotion expressed by the
writer and emotion elicited from the readers. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach for Readers' Emotion Detection from short-text documents using a deep
learning model called REDAffectiveLM. Within state-of-the-art NLP tasks, it is
well understood that utilizing context-specific representations from
transformer-based pre-trained language models helps achieve improved
performance. Within this affective computing task, we explore how incorporating
affective information can further enhance performance. Towards this, we
leverage context-specific and affect enriched representations by using a
transformer-based pre-trained language model in tandem with affect enriched
Bi-LSTM+Attention. For empirical evaluation, we procure a new dataset REN-20k,
besides using RENh-4k and SemEval-2007. We evaluate the performance of our
REDAffectiveLM rigorously across these datasets, against a vast set of
state-of-the-art baselines, where our model consistently outperforms baselines
and obtains statistically significant results. Our results establish that
utilizing affect enriched representation along with context-specific
representation within a neural architecture can considerably enhance readers'
emotion detection. Since the impact of affect enrichment specifically in
readers' emotion detection isn't well explored, we conduct a detailed analysis
over affect enriched Bi-LSTM+Attention using qualitative and quantitative model
behavior evaluation techniques. We observe that compared to conventional
semantic embedding, affect enriched embedding increases ability of the network
to effectively identify and assign weightage to key terms responsible for
readers' emotion detection.

functional role is often unclear. Even glycolysis, the paradigm example of
oscillatory biochemistry, has seen questions about its oscillatory function.
Here, we take a systems approach to summarize evidence that oscillations play
critical physiological roles. Oscillatory behavior enables systems to avoid
desensitization, to avoid chronically high and therefore toxic levels of
chemicals, and to become more resistant to noise. Oscillation also enables
complex physiological systems to reconcile incompatible conditions such as
oxidation and reduction, by cycling between them, and to synchronize the
oscillations of many small units into one large effect. In pancreatic beta
cells, glycolytic oscillations are in synchrony with calcium and mitochondrial
oscillations to drive pulsatile insulin release, which is pivotal for the liver
to regulate blood glucose dynamics. In addition, oscillation can keep
biological time, essential for embryonic development in promoting cell
diversity and pattern formation. The functional importance of oscillatory
processes requires a rethinking of the traditional doctrine of homeostasis,
holding that physiological quantities are maintained at constant equilibrium
values, a view that has largely failed us in the clinic. A more dynamic
approach will enable us to view health and disease through a new light and
initiate a paradigm shift in treating diseases, including depression and
cancer. This modern synthesis also takes a deeper look into the mechanisms that
create, sustain and abolish oscillatory processes, which requires the language
of nonlinear dynamics, well beyond the linearization techniques of equilibrium
control theory.

basis at every time-step of the on-line execution to account for the unresolved
dynamics. The adaptive ROM is formulated in a Least-Squares setting using a
variable transformation to promote stability and robustness. An efficient
strategy is developed to incorporate non-local information in the basis
adaptation, significantly enhancing the predictive capabilities of the
resulting ROMs. A detailed analysis of the computational complexity is
presented, and validated. The adaptive ROM formulation is shown to require
negligible offline training and naturally enables both future-state and
parametric predictions. The formulation is evaluated on representative reacting
flow benchmark problems, demonstrating that the ROMs are capable of providing
efficient and accurate predictions including those involving significant
changes in dynamics due to parametric variations, and transient phenomena. A
key contribution of this work is the development and demonstration of a
comprehensive ROM formulation that targets predictive capability in chaotic,
multi-scale, and transport-dominated problems.

cancer based on biomedical imaging ensures effective treatment and a better
prognosis. However, biomedical imaging presents challenges to both clinical

by slight abnormalities in individual cells or tissues, making them difficult
to detect visually. Traditionally, anomalies are diagnosed by radiologists and
pathologists with extensive training. This procedure, however, demands the
participation of professionals and incurs a substantial cost. The cost makes
large-scale biological image classification impractical. In this study, we
provide unique deep neural network designs for multiclass classification of
medical images, in particular cancer images. We incorporated transformers into
a multiclass framework to take advantage of data-gathering capability and

Behavioral science, however, suggests that people sometimes use irrelevant

compressive perturbations, also known as the effect of wave-induced thermal
misbalance, is known to result in thermal instabilities chiefly responsible for
the formation of fine thermal structuring of the corona. We study the role of
the magnetic field and field-aligned thermal conduction in triggering
instabilities of slow magnetoacoustic and entropy waves in quiescent and hot
active region loops, caused by thermal misbalance. Effects of the magnetic
field are accounted for by including it in the parametrisation of a guessed
coronal heating function, and the finite plasma parameter $\beta$, in terms of
the first-order thin flux tube approximation. Thermal conduction tends to
stabilise both slow and entropy modes, broadening the interval of plausible
coronal heating functions allowing for the existence of a thermodynamically
stable corona. This effect is most pronounced for hot loops. In contrast to
entropy waves, the stability of which is found to be insensitive to the
possible dependence of the coronal heating function on the magnetic field, slow
waves remain stable only for certain functional forms of this dependence,
opening up perspectives for its seismological diagnostics in future.

models high weights in the regions where they best perform, and vice versa, by
introducing a measure of distance between high-fidelity data and individual
model predictions. The model weights are then mapped into a space of features,
representative of local flow physics, and regressed by a Random Forests (RF)
algorithm. The RF regressor is finally employed to infer spatial distributions
of the model weights for unseen configurations. Predictions of new cases are
constructed as a convex linear combination of the underlying models solutions,
while the between model variance provides information about regions of high

inform the RF regressor, and performs well for other quantities well-correlated

consistent with the target high-fidelity data. The present approach then

efficiency of accelerating $\gamma \gtrsim 100$ ($T_e \gtrsim 10^{11}$ K)

during flares, the hot plasma produced by reconnection significantly enhances
230 GHz emission and increases the size of the 230 GHz image. By contrast, for
models in which the electrons are heated to higher temperatures (which we argue
are better motivated), the reconnection-heated plasma is too hot to produce
significant 230 GHz synchrotron emission, and the 230 GHz flux decreases during
high energy flares. We do not find a significant change in the mm polarization

connection between the real world and the virtual world. Recent efforts adopted
a two-stage framework that first builds 2D pose estimations in multiple camera
views from different perspectives and then synthesizes them into 3D poses.
However, the focus has largely been on developing new computer vision
algorithms on the offline video datasets without much consideration on the
energy constraints in real-world systems with flexibly-deployed and
battery-powered cameras. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient
edge-assisted multiple-camera system, dubbed E$^3$Pose, for real-time
multi-human 3D pose estimation, based on the key idea of adaptive camera
selection. Instead of always employing all available cameras to perform 2D pose
estimations as in the existing works, E$^3$Pose selects only a subset of
cameras depending on their camera view qualities in terms of occlusion and
energy states in an adaptive manner, thereby reducing the energy consumption
(which translates to extended battery lifetime) and improving the estimation
accuracy. To achieve this goal, E$^3$Pose incorporates an attention-based LSTM
to predict the occlusion information of each camera view and guide camera
selection before cameras are selected to process the images of a scene, and
runs a camera selection algorithm based on the Lyapunov optimization framework
to make long-term adaptive selection decisions. We build a prototype of
E$^3$Pose on a 5-camera testbed, demonstrate its feasibility and evaluate its
performance. Our results show that a significant energy saving (up to 31.21%)
can be achieved while maintaining a high 3D pose estimation accuracy comparable

we mean one in which clusters (e.g., households, schools, or graph partitions)

by random assignment of units within each treated cluster to either treatment
or control based on the selected treated fraction; by covariate-adaptive
randomization, we mean randomization schemes that first stratify according to
baseline covariates and then assign treatment status so as to achieve ""balance""
within each stratum. We examine estimation and inference of such designs under
two different asymptotic regimes, namely, ""small strata"" (e.g., matched-pair
designs) and ""large strata"" (e.g., stratified block randomization). Our
analysis of these two regimes enables us to study a broad range of commonly
used designs from the empirical literature. We establish conditions under which
our estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal and develop consistent
estimators of their corresponding asymptotic variances. Combining these results
establishes the asymptotic validity of tests based on these estimators. We
argue that ignoring covariate information in the design stage can result in
efficiency loss, and commonly used inference methods that ignore or improperly
use covariate information can lead to either conservative or invalid inference.
Then, we apply our results to studying optimal use of covariate information
under covariate-adaptive randomization in large samples, and show that a
certain generalized matched-pair design achieves minimum asymptotic variance

confirm the practical relevance of our theoretical results.

  tidal and magnetic interactions and mass loss","18 pages, 13 figures. Submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stad394",,"astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Various interactions affect the population of close-in planets. Among them,
the tidal and magnetic interactions drive orbital decay and star-planet angular
momentum exchange, leading to stellar spin-up. As a result of the above
processes, a planet may initiate the mass transfer to the host star once it
encounters the Roche limit. Another mechanism providing substantial mass loss
is associated with the atmospheric escape caused by photoevaporation followed
by orbital expansion, which is thought to be important for hot Neptunes and
super-Earths. Thus, the fraction of the initial number of hot Jupiters may
transform into lower-mass planets through the Roche-lobe overflow (RLO) phase
and continue secular evolution under the effect of photoevaporation. In the
present paper, we compile the latest prescriptions for tidal and magnetic
migration and mass-loss rates to explore the dynamics of hot Jupiter systems.
We study how the implemented interactions shape the orbital architecture of
Jovian planets and whether their impact is enough to reproduce the
observational sample. Our models suggest that the tidal interaction is able to
generate the upper boundary of the hot Jupiter population in the
mass-separation diagram. To recreate the sub-Jovian desert, we need to make
additional assumptions regarding the RLO phase or the influence of the
protoplanetary disc's inner edge on the initial planetary location. According
to our estimates, 12-15% of hot Jupiters around solar-mass stars have been
engulfed or become lower-mass planets. 0.20-0.25% of the present-day giant
planet population undergoes decay intense enough to be detected with modern
facilities.

structure by systematically testing conditional independences observed in the

graphical characterizations of the so-called equivalence class of causal graphs
proposed by Pearl. However, constraint-based causal discovery algorithms
struggle when data is limited since conditional independence tests quickly lose
their statistical power, especially when the conditioning set is large. To
address this, we propose using conditional independence tests where the size of
the conditioning set is upper bounded by some integer $k$ for robust causal
discovery. The existing graphical characterizations of the equivalence classes
of causal graphs are not applicable when we cannot leverage all the conditional
independence statements. We first define the notion of $k$-Markov equivalence:
Two causal graphs are $k$-Markov equivalent if they entail the same conditional
independence constraints where the conditioning set size is upper bounded by
$k$. We propose a novel representation that allows us to graphically
characterize $k$-Markov equivalence between two causal graphs. We propose a
sound constraint-based algorithm called the $k$-PC algorithm for learning this
equivalence class. Finally, we conduct synthetic, and semi-synthetic
experiments to demonstrate that the $k$-PC algorithm enables more robust causal
discovery in the small sample regime compared to the baseline PC algorithm.

Structural Causal Models (SCM) from observational datasets using deep

for answering counterfactual queries. In this work, we warn practitioners about
non-identifiability of counterfactual inference from observational data, even

We prove counterfactual identifiability of monotonic generation mechanisms with

counterfactual identifiability, motivating the need for parametric assumptions.
As a practical approach, we propose a method for estimating worst-case errors

essential metric for deciding whether or not DSCMs are a viable approach for
counterfactual inference in a specific problem setting. In evaluation, our

lead to position-dependent blur when an image of that sample is taken using an

may have a scalar or tensor character, depending on whether the random
microstructure has an autocorrelation function that is rotationally isotropic

electrons to form the Kondo cloud1,2, which can spread out over a few
micrometres3,4. For a metal with dense magnetic impurities such that Kondo
clouds overlap with each other, correlated ground states are formed. When the
impurities form a regular lattice, the result is a heavy fermion or
anti-ferromagnetic order depending on the dominant interaction5,6. Even in the
case of random impurities, overlapping Kondo clouds are expected to form a
coherent ground state. Here, we examine this issue by performing electrical
transport and high-precision tunnelling density-of-states (DOS) spectroscopy
measurements in a highly P-doped crystalline silicon metal where
disorder-induced localized magnetic moments exist7. We detect the Kondo effect
in the resistivity of the Si metal below 2 K and an exotic pseudogap in the DOS
with gap edge peaks at a Fermi energy below 100 mK. The DOS gap and peaks are
tuned by applying an external magnetic field and transformed into a metallic
Altshuler-Aronov gap8 in the paramagnetic disordered Fermi liquid (DFL) phase.
We interpret this phenomenon as the Kondo condensation, the formation of a
correlated ground state of overlapping Kondo clouds, and its transition to a
DFL. The boundary between the Kondo condensation and DFL phases is identified
by analysing distinct DOS spectra in the magnetic field-temperature plane. A
detailed theoretical analysis using a holographic method 9 , 10 , 11 reproduces
the unusual DOS spectra, 1, supporting our scenario. Our work demonstrates the
observation of the magnetic version of Bardeen-Cooper-Shrieffer (BCS) pair
condensation and will be useful for understanding complex Kondo systems.

algebraic Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence closures. Recent
years have witnessed a blossom in applying machine learning (ML) methods to
revolutionize the paradigm of turbulence modeling. However, due to the
black-box essence of most ML methods, it is currently hard to extract
interpretable information and knowledge from data-driven models. To address
this critical limitation, this work leverages deep learning with symbolic
regression methods to discover hidden governing equations of Reynolds stress
models. Specifically, the Reynolds stress tensor is decomposed into linear and
non-linear parts. While the linear part is taken as the regular linear eddy
viscosity model, a long short-term memory neural network is employed to
generate symbolic terms on which tractable mathematical expressions for the
non-linear counterpart are built. A novel reinforcement learning algorithm is
employed to train the neural network to produce best-fitted symbolic
expressions. Within the proposed framework, the Reynolds stress closure is
explicitly expressed in algebraic forms, thus allowing for direct functional
inference. On the other hand, the Galilean and rotational invariance are
craftily respected by constructing the training feature space with independent
invariants and tensor basis functions. The performance of the present
methodology is validated through numerical simulations of three different
canonical flows that deviate in geometrical configurations. The results
demonstrate promising accuracy improvements over traditional RANS models,
showing the generalization ability of the proposed method. Moreover, with the
given explicit model equations, it can be easier to interpret the influence of
input features on generated models.

resource-intensive, particularly in iterative calculations. To address this
time-consuming issue, this study employs a diffusion-based generative model as
a replacement for computational analysis in design optimization. The model
learns the geometry of microstructure and corresponding stress contours,
allowing for the prediction of microstructural behavior based solely on
geometry, without the need for additional analysis. The focus on this work is
on mechanoluminescence (ML) particulate composites made with europium ions and
dysprosium ions. Multi-objective optimization is conducted based on the
generative diffusion model to improve light sensitivity and fracture toughness.
The results show multiple candidates of microstructure that meet the design

particulate composites. The proposed approach provides a new way to

experimentally. Experimental results show that cobalt oxide becomes a powder
after plasma irradiation and is easily separated from the surface of the base
metal. The optimal plasma generating conditions of the dielectric barrier
discharge (DBD) used in this experimental study were obtained at atmospheric
pressure, voltage 4.5 kV, and frequency 25 kHz with a etching rate of 10.875
{\mu}mol/min. The samples were analyzed before and after plasma irradiation,
using Scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(SEM/EDX) and the purification rate was performed using a sequential weighting
of the samples with scales 10^(-4) grams accurately obtained. The results show
the ability of this method to effectively remove the surface contamination of
cobalt from the surface of stainless steel 304.

better understood to extrapolate their applicability to reactor-relevant
devices. This paper describes non-linear extended MHD simulations that use an
experimental equilibrium from an EDA H-mode in ASDEX Upgrade. Linear ideal MHD
analysis indicates that the operational point lies slightly inside of the
stable region. The non-linear simulations with the visco-resistive extended MHD
code, JOREK, sustain non-axisymmetric perturbations that are linearly most
unstable with toroidal mode numbers of n = \{6 \dots 9\}, but non-linearly
higher and lower n become driven and the low-n become dominant. The poloidal
mode velocity during the linear phase is found to correspond to the expected
velocity for resistive ballooning modes. The perturbations that exist in the
simulations have somewhat smaller poloidal wavenumbers (k_{\theta} \sim 0.1 to
0.5 cm^{-1} ) than the experimental expectations for the quasi-coherent mode in
EDA, and cause non-negligible transport in both the heat and particle channels.
In the transition from linear to non-linear phase, the mode frequency chirps
down from approximately 35 kHz to 13 kHz, which corresponds approximately to
the lower end of frequencies that are typically observed in EDA H-modes in
ASDEX Upgrade.

to defend against adversarial attacks and has drawn increasing interest from
researchers. However, the existing AT methods still suffer from two challenges.
First, they are unable to handle unrestricted adversarial examples (UAEs),
which are built from scratch, as opposed to restricted adversarial examples
(RAEs), which are created by adding perturbations bound by an $l_p$ norm to
observed examples. Second, the existing AT methods often achieve adversarial
robustness at the expense of standard generalizability (i.e., the accuracy on
natural examples) because they make a tradeoff between them. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a unique viewpoint that understands UAEs as
imperceptibly perturbed unobserved examples. Also, we find that the tradeoff
results from the separation of the distributions of adversarial examples and
natural examples. Based on these ideas, we propose a novel AT approach called
Provable Unrestricted Adversarial Training (PUAT), which can provide a target
classifier with comprehensive adversarial robustness against both UAE and RAE,
and simultaneously improve its standard generalizability. Particularly, PUAT
utilizes partially labeled data to achieve effective UAE generation by
accurately capturing the natural data distribution through a novel augmented
triple-GAN. At the same time, PUAT extends the traditional AT by introducing
the supervised loss of the target classifier into the adversarial loss and
achieves the alignment between the UAE distribution, the natural data
distribution, and the distribution learned by the classifier, with the
collaboration of the augmented triple-GAN. Finally, the solid theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments conducted on widely-used benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of PUAT.

pre-processed, and fed to ML algorithms, such as logistic regression, support

the hidden layer of NN beyond a second does not increase the overall score and

untrimmed video according to a query sentence. This task has achieved
significant momentum in the computer vision community as it enables activity
grounding beyond pre-defined activity classes by utilizing the semantic
diversity of natural language descriptions. The semantic diversity is rooted in
the principle of compositionality in linguistics, where novel semantics can be
systematically described by combining known words in novel ways (compositional
generalization). However, existing temporal grounding datasets are not
carefully designed to evaluate the compositional generalizability. To
systematically benchmark the compositional generalizability of temporal
grounding models, we introduce a new Compositional Temporal Grounding task and
construct two new dataset splits, i.e., Charades-CG and ActivityNet-CG. When
evaluating the state-of-the-art methods on our new dataset splits, we
empirically find that they fail to generalize to queries with novel
combinations of seen words. We argue that the inherent structured semantics
inside the videos and language is the crucial factor to achieve compositional
generalization. Based on this insight, we propose a variational cross-graph
reasoning framework that explicitly decomposes video and language into
hierarchical semantic graphs, respectively, and learns fine-grained semantic
correspondence between the two graphs. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
adaptive structured semantics learning approach to derive the
structure-informed and domain-generalizable graph representations, which
facilitate the fine-grained semantic correspondence reasoning between the two
graphs. Extensive experiments validate the superior compositional
generalizability of our approach.

Furthermore, we continue to train the existing pre-trained models by masked

The extensive experiments demonstrate that ContraBERT can effectively improve

$\widetilde{S}_{\alpha} (m,n)$ reduces to $\ln m - \frac{\alpha}{2 n} (m -

$\widetilde{S}_{\alpha} (m,n)$. It is remarkable to note that the nearly

improvement. Still, the potential of heterogeneous feature propagation between
2D and 3D domains has not been fully explored. In this paper, in contrast to
existing pixel-to-point feature propagation, we investigate an opposite
point-to-pixel direction, allowing point-wise features to flow inversely into
the 2D image branch. Thus, when jointly optimizing the 2D and 3D streams, the
gradients back-propagated from the 2D image branch can boost the representation
ability of the 3D backbone network working on LiDAR point clouds. Then,
combining pixel-to-point and point-to-pixel information flow mechanisms, we
construct an bidirectional feature propagation framework, dubbed BiProDet. In

coordinates map estimation, a new 2D auxiliary task for the training of the 2D

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Strangeon star model has passed various observational tests, such as the
massive pulsars and the tidal deformability during binary mergers. Pulsar
glitch, as a useful probe for studying the interior structure of pulsars, has
also been studied in strangeon star model in our previous papers, including the
recovery coefficient, the waiting time of glitches and glitch activity. In this
paper, the recovery process of a glitch is described in the strangeon star
model, based on the starquake picture established in Paper I. After the
starquake, the inner motion of the stellar matter would reduce the tangential
pressure in the cracked places at the equatorial plane. The recovery (increase)
of the tangential pressure would be achieved by a viscous flow towards the
cracked places at equatorial plane, which leads to the exponential recovery of
the spin frequency. A uniform viscous flow can reproduce the single exponential
decay observed in some glitches, and the viscous time-scale $\tau$ and the
depth $h$ of the cracking place below the surface can be fitted by the recovery
data. It is found that $h$ increases with glitch size $\Delta\nu/\nu$, which is
expected in the glitch scenario of strangeon stars. The magnitude of the
recovery predicted in this recovery model is also consistent with that derived
from observations. The single exponential decay reproduced by a uniform viscous
flow can be generalized to two or more exponentials by the multi-component of
viscous flows.

some massive stars immediately before core collapse. However, occurring too
late, it has a negligible impact on the star's evolution or the final yields,
which are influenced instead by the longer-term, quasi-steady mass loss taking
place during H and He burning. Late-time observations of core-collapse
supernovae interacting with the progenitor wind are one means to constrain this
secular mass loss. Here, we present radiative transfer calculations for a Type
II SN with and without this interaction power, focusing on the phase between
350 and 1000d after explosion. Without interaction power, the ejecta are
powered through radioactive decay whose exponential decline produces an
ever-fading SN. Instead, with a constant interaction power of $10^{40}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ (representative of an SN II ramming into a steady-state $10^{-6}
M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ wind), the spectrum morphs from decay powered at 350d, with
narrow lines forming in the inner metal-rich ejecta, to interaction powered at
1000d, with broad boxy lines forming in the outer H-rich ejecta. Intermediate
times are characterized by a hybrid and complex spectrum made of overlapping
narrow and broad lines. While interaction boosts primarily the flux in the
ultraviolet, which remains largely unobserved today, a knee in the $R$-band
light curve or a $U$-band boost are clear signatures of interaction at late
times. The model predictions compare favorably with a number of Type II
supernovae including SN 2004et or SN 2017eaw at 500-1000d after explosion.

between magnon and qubit mode, one can effectively generate a magnon bundle via
super-Rabi oscillations. In contrast with general wisdom, magnetic dissipation
plays an enabling role in generating the magnon bundle, where the relaxation
time of magnons determines the typical time delay between two successive
magnons. The maximal damping that allows an antibunched magnon bundle can reach
the order of 0.1, which may break the monopoly of low-dissipation magnetic
insulators in quantum spintronics and enables a large class of magnetic
materials for quantum manipulation. Further, our finding may provide a scalable

longitudinal vortices in monochromatic light beams, STOVs do not carry any net
transverse OAM about a fixed transverse axis crossing its center. However,
STOVs transport an intrinsic transverse OAM per photon about a moving,
transverse axis through its center, and an opposite extrinsic transverse OAM.
Their applications would thus preclude setting particles at rest into rotation,
but STOVs could transmit their intrinsic transverse OAM to photons of other
waves. The intrinsic transverse OAM per photon of an elliptically symmetric
STOV of frequency $\omega_0$ and topological charge $l$ is $\gamma
l/2\omega_0$, where $\gamma$ is the STOV ellipticity. Thus circularly symmetric
STOVs ($\gamma=1$) carry half the intrinsic longitudinal OAM of circularly

intrinsic transverse OAM in Phys. Rev. A 107, L031501 (2023) yields infinite
values and is not conserved on propagation for a particular STOV. When STOVs
lose their elliptical symmetry upon propagation, they preserve the intrinsic

quantum-related activities and experiments in the last few years (although
medicine and quantum theory have arguably been entangled ever since
Schr\""odinger's cat). The initial focus was on biochemical and computational
biology problems; recently, however, clinical and medical quantum solutions
have drawn increasing interest. The rapid emergence of quantum computing in
health and medicine necessitates a mapping of the landscape. In this review,
clinical and medical proof-of-concept quantum computing applications are
outlined and put into perspective. These consist of over 40 experimental and
theoretical studies from the last few years. The use case areas span genomics,
clinical research and discovery, diagnostics, and treatments and interventions.
Quantum machine learning (QML) in particular has rapidly evolved and shown to
be competitive with classical benchmarks in recent medical research. Near-term
QML algorithms, for instance, quantum support vector classifiers and quantum
neural networks, have been trained with diverse clinical and real-world data
sets. This includes studies in generating new molecular entities as drug
candidates, diagnosing based on medical image classification, predicting
patient persistence, forecasting treatment effectiveness, and tailoring
radiotherapy. The use cases and algorithms are summarized and an outlook on
medicine in the quantum era, including technical and ethical challenges, is
provided.

linearly with system size, and whose eigenvalues systematically approximate the
excitation energies of GW theory. This is achieved by rigorously expanding the
self-energy in order to exactly conserve a desired number of
frequency-independent moments of the self-energy dynamics. Recasting $GW$ in
this way admits a low-scaling O[$N^4$] approach to build and solve this
Hamiltonian, with a proposal to reduce this further to O[$N^3$]. This relies on
exposing a novel recursive framework for the density response moments of the
random phase approximation (RPA), where the efficient calculation of its
starting point mirrors the low-scaling approaches to compute RPA correlation
energies. The frequency integration of $GW$ which distinguishes so many
different GW variants can be performed without approximation directly in this
moment representation. Furthermore, the solution to the Dyson equation can be
performed exactly, avoiding analytic continuation, diagonal approximations or
iterative solutions to the quasiparticle equation, with the full-frequency
spectrum obtained from the complete solution of this effective static
Hamiltonian. We show how this approach converges rapidly with respect to the
order of the conserved self-energy moments, and is applied across the GW100
benchmark dataset to obtain accurate $GW$ spectra in comparison to traditional
implementations. We also show the ability to systematically converge
all-electron full-frequency spectra and high-energy features beyond frontier
excitations, as well as avoiding discontinuities in the spectrum which afflict
many other GW approaches.

challenge for advancing next-generation Internet service and privacy

embedding in FL results in expensive communication cost and latency. To address
these challenges, we propose Federated Recommendation with Additive
Personalization (FedRAP), which learns a global view of items via FL and a
personalized view locally on each user. FedRAP enforces sparsity of the global
view to save FL's communication cost and encourages difference between the two
views through regularization. We propose an effective curriculum to learn the
local and global views progressively with increasing regularization weights. To
produce recommendations for an user, FedRAP adds the two views together to
obtain a personalized item embedding. FedRAP achieves the best performance in

diffusion coefficients in magnetized QCD medium become anisotropic, and with
increasing temperature, the higher Landau levels become significant, which
leads to the reduction of the anisotropic ratio ($>$ 1) and even overturn the

contribution of HQ momentum diffusion coefficient in the low (high) temperature
is dominant. And the anisotropy feature of the real part of the potential is
essentially encoded in angular dependent Coulomb coupling and string tension.
Whereas, the imaginary part of the potential from quark-loop in this work
displays a significant anisotropy even though using the angular-independent
Coulomb coupling and string tension. Furthermore, we study the magnetic
response of viscous quark matter, which is manifested in the non-equilibrium
distribution function of (anti-)quark by solving Boltzmann equation within the

decelerates. Modelling the light curve provides an estimated mass-loss rate of

First, we propose a transformer-based model for OVS, termed as OVSegmentor,
which only exploits web-crawled image-text pairs for pre-training without using
any mask annotations. OVSegmentor assembles the image pixels into a set of
learnable group tokens via a slot-attention based binding module, and aligns
the group tokens to the corresponding caption embedding. Second, we propose two
proxy tasks for training, namely masked entity completion and cross-image mask
consistency. The former aims to infer all masked entities in the caption given
the group tokens, that enables the model to learn fine-grained alignment
between visual groups and text entities. The latter enforces consistent mask
predictions between images that contain shared entities, which encourages the
model to learn visual invariance. Third, we construct CC4M dataset for
pre-training by filtering CC12M with frequently appeared entities, which
significantly improves training efficiency. Fourth, we perform zero-shot

spintronic devices and playgrounds for exploring collective magnetic phenomena
down to the two-dimensional limit. Chromium-tellurium compounds are relevant in
this perspective. In particular, the 1$T$ phase of CrTe$_2$ has been argued to
have a Curie temperature above 300~K, a rare and desirable property in the
class of lamellar materials, making it a candidate for practical applications.
However, recent literature reveals a strong variability in the reported
properties, including magnetic ones. Using electron microscopy, diffraction and
spectroscopy techniques, together with local and macroscopic magnetometry
approaches, our work sheds new light on the structural, chemical and magnetic
properties of bulk 1$T$-CrTe$_2$ exfoliated in the form of flakes having a
thickness ranging from few to several tens of nanometers. We unambiguously
establish that 1$T$-CrTe$_2$ flakes are ferromagnetic above room temperature,
have an in-plane easy axis of magnetization, low coercivity, and we confirm
that their Raman spectroscopy signatures are two modes, $E_{2\text{g}}$
(103.5~cm$^{-1}$) and $A_{1\text{g}}$ (136.5~cm$^{-1}$). We also prove that
thermal annealing causes a phase transformation to monoclinic Cr$_5$Te$_8$ and,
to a lesser extent, to trigonal Cr$_5$Te$_8$. In sharp contrast with
1$T$-CrTe$_2$, none of these compounds have a Curie temperature above room
temperature, and they both have perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Our findings
reconcile the apparently conflicting reports in the literature and open
opportunities for phase-engineered magnetic properties.

(MKF), using the exact moment propagation method. Existing state estimation
methods use linearization techniques or sampling points to compute approximate
values of moments. However, moment propagation of probability distributions of
random variables through nonlinear process and measurement models play a key
role in the development of state estimation and directly affects their
performance. The proposed moment propagation procedure can compute exact
moments for non-Gaussian as well as non-independent Gaussian random variables.
Thus, MKF can propagate exact moments of uncertain state variables up to any
desired order. MKF is derivative-free and does not require tuning parameters.
Moreover, MKF has the same computation time complexity as the extended or
unscented Kalman filters, i.e., EKF and UKF. The experimental evaluations show
that MKF is the preferred filter in comparison to EKF and UKF and outperforms
both filters in non-Gaussian noise regimes.

have been growing ever more complex, and at the same time have more and more

as an important research field that helps humans to better comprehend ML
systems. In parallel, quantum machine learning (QML) is emerging with the
ongoing improvement of quantum computing hardware combined with its increasing
availability via cloud services. QML enables quantum-enhanced ML in which
quantum mechanics is exploited to facilitate ML tasks, typically in form of
quantum-classical hybrid algorithms that combine quantum and classical
resources. Quantum gates constitute the building blocks of gate-based quantum
hardware and form circuits that can be used for quantum computations. For QML
applications, quantum circuits are typically parameterized and their parameters
are optimized classically such that a suitably defined objective function is
minimized. Inspired by XAI, we raise the question of explainability of such
circuits by quantifying the importance of (groups of) gates for specific goals.
To this end, we transfer and adapt the well-established concept of Shapley
values to the quantum realm. The resulting attributions can be interpreted as
explanations for why a specific circuit works well for a given task, improving
the understanding of how to construct parameterized (or variational) quantum
circuits, and fostering their human interpretability in general. An
experimental evaluation on simulators and two superconducting quantum hardware
devices demonstrates the benefits of the proposed framework for classification,
generative modeling, transpilation, and optimization. Furthermore, our results

entanglement gap is finite in the paramagnetic phase, and it vanishes in the

understood in terms of standard magnetic correlation functions. The
entanglement gap decays as $\delta\xi\simeq C_\alpha L^{-(1/2-\alpha/4)}$,

known that ${\mathcal E}(A)=\{e^{2 \pi i x \cdot a}\}_{a \in A}$ cannot serve
as an orthogonal basis for $L^2(K)$ \cite{IKT01}. In this paper, we prove that
even approximate average orthogonality is an obstacle to the existence of an

point is that if ${\mathcal E}(A)$ is a frame for $L^2(K)$, then very few pairs
of distinct exponentials $e^{2 \pi i x.a}, e^{2 \pi i x.a'}$ from ${\mathcal
E}(A)$ come anywhere near being orthogonal. Our proof uses a generalization of
Bourgain's result on pinned distances determined by sets of positive Lebesgue
upper density in ${\Bbb R}^d$, $d \ge 2$. We also improve the $L^{\infty}$
version of this result originally established in \cite{IM2020}. By using an
extension of the combinatorial idea from \cite{IR03}, we prove that under the

intrinsic properties of reddened objects and correctly interpret observations.
In this work, we attempt to measure the optical--infrared extinction laws of
the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC) by using red supergiant
(RSG) stars and classical Cepheids as extinction tracers. The spectroscopic RSG
samples are constructed based on the APOGEE spectral parameters, Gaia
astrometric data, and multi-band photometry. We establish the effective
temperature--intrinsic color relations for RSG stars and determine the color
excess ratio (CER) E(lambda-GRP)/E(GBP-GRP) for LMC and SMC. We use classical
Cepheids to derive base relative extinction A_GRP/E(GBP-GRP). The results are
1.589+-0.014 and 1.412+-0.041 for LMC and SMC. By combining CERs with A_GRP
/E(GBP-GRP), the optical--infrared extinction coefficients A_lambda/A_GRP are
determined for 16 bands. We adjust the parameters of Rv-dependent extinction
laws and obtain the average extinction law of LMC and SMC as Rv=3.40+-0.07 and
Rv=2.53+-0.10, which are consistent with Gordon et al. (2003). In the optical
bands, the adjusted Rv extinction curves agree with the observations with
deviations less than 3%.

the training and test sets have no shared relation types. This very challenging
domain is a good test of a model's ability to generalize. Previous approaches
to ZRE reframed relation extraction as Question Answering (QA), allowing for
the use of pre-trained QA models. However, this method required manually
creating gold question templates for each new relation. Here, we do away with
these gold templates and instead learn a model that can generate questions for
unseen relations. Our technique can successfully translate relation
descriptions into relevant questions, which are then leveraged to generate the
correct tail entity. On tail entity extraction, we outperform the previous
state-of-the-art by more than 16 F1 points without using gold question
templates. On the RE-QA dataset where no previous baseline for relation
extraction exists, our proposed algorithm comes within 0.7 F1 points of a
system that uses gold question templates. Our model also outperforms the
state-of-the-art ZRE baselines on the FewRel and WikiZSL datasets, showing that
QA models no longer need template questions to match the performance of models
specifically tailored to the ZRE task. Our implementation is available at

  under geometric conditions and constraints",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Have you ever been troubled by the complexity and computational cost of SE(3)
protein structure modeling and been amazed by the simplicity and power of
language modeling? Recent work has shown promise in simplifying protein
structures as sequences of protein angles; therefore, language models could be
used for unconstrained protein backbone generation. Unfortunately, such
simplification is unsuitable for the constrained protein inpainting problem,
where the model needs to recover masked structures conditioned on unmasked
ones, as it dramatically increases the computing cost of geometric constraints.
To overcome this dilemma, we suggest inserting a hidden \textbf{a}tomic
\textbf{d}irection \textbf{s}pace (\textbf{ADS}) upon the language model,
converting invariant backbone angles into equivalent direction vectors and
preserving the simplicity, called Seq2Direct encoder ($\text{Enc}_{s2d}$).
Geometric constraints could be efficiently imposed on the newly introduced
direction space. A Direct2Seq decoder ($\text{Dec}_{d2s}$) with mathematical
guarantees is also introduced to develop a \textbf{SDS}
($\text{Enc}_{s2d}$+$\text{Dec}_{d2s}$) model. We apply the SDS model as the
denoising neural network during the conditional diffusion process, resulting in
a constrained generative model--\textbf{DiffSDS}. Extensive experiments show
that the plug-and-play ADS could transform the language model into a strong
structural model without loss of simplicity. More importantly, the proposed
DiffSDS outperforms previous strong baselines by a large margin on the task of
protein inpainting.

Compared to the previously proposed hybrid negative mass spin-optomechanical

efficiently compute the gradient. As a result, the number of layers in the

objective of this paper is to express the gradient of the loss function in
terms of a matrix multiplication using the Jacobian operator. This can be
achieved by considering the total derivative of each layer with respect to its
parameters and expressing it as a Jacobian matrix. The gradient can then be
represented as the matrix product of these Jacobian matrices. This approach is
valid because the chain rule can be applied to a composition of vector-valued

generalization of the original Bernstein-Vazirani problem) and a quantum
algorithm to solve it are proposed. The problem involves finding one or more
secret keys from a set of multiple secret keys (encoded in binary form) using a
quantum oracle. From a set of multiple unknown keys, the proposed quantum
algorithm is capable of (a) obtaining any key (with certainty) using a single
query to the probabilistic oracle and (b) finding all keys with a high
probability (approaching 1 in the limiting case). In contrast, a classical
algorithm will be unable to find even a single bit of a secret key with
certainty (in the general case). Owing to the probabilistic nature of the
oracle, a classical algorithm can only be useful in obtaining limiting
probability distributions of $ 0 $ and $ 1 $ for each bit-position of secret
keys (based on multiple oracle calls) and this information can further be used
to infer some estimates on the distribution of secret keys based on
combinatorial considerations. For comparison, it is worth noting that a
classical algorithm can be used to exactly solve the original
Bernstein-Vazirani problem (involving a deterministic oracle and a single
hidden key containing $n$ bits) with a query complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n)$. An
interesting class of problems similar to the probabilistic version of the
Bernstein-Vazirani problem can be construed, where quantum algorithms can
provide efficient solutions with certainty or with a high degree of confidence
and classical algorithms would fail to do so.

weather parameters on solar PV power generation is estimated by several
Ensemble ML (EML) models like Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Voting for the
first time. The performance of chosen ML algorithms is validated by field
dataset of a 10kWp solar PV power plant in Eastern India region. Furthermore, a
complete test-bed framework has been designed for data mining as well as to
select appropriate learning models. It also supports feature selection and
reduction for dataset to reduce space and time complexity of the learning

the main pillars of production and trade in West Africa: livestock is moved
around in search of better grazing or sold in markets for domestic consumption
and for festival-related activities. These movements cover several thousand
kilometers and have the capability of connecting the whole West African region
thus facilitating the diffusion of many animal and zoonotic diseases. Several
factors shape mobility patterns even in normal years and surveillance systems
need to account for such changes. In this paper, we present a procedure based
on temporal network theory to identify possible sentinel locations using two
indicators: vulnerability (i.e. the probability of being reached by the
disease) and time of infection (i.e. the time of first arrival of the disease).
Using these indicators in our structural analysis of the changing network
enabled us to identify a set of nodes that could be used in an early warning
system. As a case study we simulated the introduction of F.A.S.T. (Foot and
Mouth Similar Transboundary) diseases in Senegal and used data taken from 2020
Sanitary certificates (LPS, laissez-passer sanitaire) issued by the Senegalese
Veterinary Services to reconstruct the national mobility network. Our analysis
showed that a static approach can significantly overestimate the speed and the
extent of disease propagation, whereas temporal analysis revealed that the
reachability and vulnerability of the different administrative departments
(used as nodes of the mobility network) change over the course of the year. For
this reason, several sets of sentinel nodes were identified in different
periods of the year, underlining the role of temporality in shaping patterns of
disease diffusion.

may be used across different domains. The primary objective of this research is
to summarize current advances in awareness requirements for adaptive strategies
based on an examination of state-of-the-art methods described in the
literature. This paper presents a review of self-adaptive systems in the
context of requirement awareness and summarizes the most common methodologies
applied. At first glance, it gives a review of the previous surveys and works
about self-adaptive systems. Afterward, it classifies the current self-adaptive
systems based on six criteria. Then, it presents and evaluates the most common
self-adaptive approaches. Lastly, an evaluation among the self-adaptive models
is conducted based on four concepts (requirements description, monitoring,
relationship, dependency/impact, and tools).

facilitate the trading of fiat-pegged stablecoins with the stablecoin Silk, but
it can be applied to any pair of stablecoins. The Silkswap invariant is a
hybrid function that generates an asymmetric price impact curve. We present the
derivation of the Silkswap model and its mathematical properties. We also
compare different numerical methods used to solve the invariant equation.
Finally, we compare our model with the well-known Curve Finance model.

  Phenotypes",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unpaired image-to-image translation methods aim at learning a mapping of
images from a source domain to a target domain. Recently, these methods proved
to be very useful in biological applications to display subtle phenotypic cell
variations otherwise invisible to the human eye. However, current models
require a large number of images to be trained, while mostmicroscopy
experiments remain limited in the number of images they can produce. In this
work, we present an improved CycleGAN architecture that employs self-supervised
discriminators to alleviate the need for numerous images. We demonstrate
quantitatively and qualitatively that the proposed approach outperforms the
CycleGAN baseline, including when it is combined with differentiable
augmentations. We also provide results obtained with small biological datasets
on obvious and non-obvious cell phenotype variations, demonstrating a
straightforward application of this method.

  reactions and fast-charging",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Uncontrolled crystal growth during electroreduction of reactive metals in
liquid electrolytes produces porous, low-density, mossy metal deposits that
grow primarily along the surface normal vector to a planar electrode substrate.
The moss-like deposits are fragile and cause premature failure of batteries by
chemical, physical, and mechanical pathways. Here we use electroanalytical
Rotating-Disk Electrode (RDE) studies in a three-electrode electrochemical cell
to elucidate the fundamental origin of moss-like growth of metals. We report
that competing Faradaic reactions occurring on the electrode surface is the
source of the phenomenon. On this basis, we conclude that a moss-like growth
regime can be accessed during electrodeposition of any metal by subtle shifts
in electrolyte chemistry and deposition rate. Specifically, for Zn, a metal
that conventionally is not known to form moss-like electrodeposits, obvious
moss-like deposition patterns emerge at low-current densities in
strongly-alkaline electrolytes that undergo electroreduction to form an
interphase on the electrodeposited Zn. Conversely, we find that under
conditions where the rate of metal electroplating is large relative to that of
other competing Faradaic reactions, it is possible to eliminate the mossy-like
growth regime for Zn. Taken together, our findings open up a new approach for
simultaneously achieving favorable metal deposition morphology and fast
charging in next-generation batteries using metal anodes.

  observable and distal reward environments for lifelong reinforcement learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper introduces a set of formally defined and transparent problems for
reinforcement learning algorithms with the following characteristics: (1)
variable degrees of observability (non-Markov observations), (2) distal and
sparse rewards, (3) variable and hierarchical reward structure, (4)
multiple-task generation, (5) variable problem complexity. The environment
provides 1D or 2D categorical observations, and takes actions as input. The
core structure of the CT-graph is a multi-branch tree graph with arbitrary
branching factor, depth, and observation sets that can be varied to increase
the dimensions of the problem in a controllable and measurable way. Two main
categories of states, decision states and wait states, are devised to create a
hierarchy of importance among observations, typical of real-world problems. A
large observation set can produce a vast set of histories that impairs
memory-augmented agents. Variable reward functions allow for the easy creation
of multiple tasks and the ability of an agent to efficiently adapt in dynamic
scenarios where tasks with controllable degrees of similarities are presented.
Challenging complexity levels can be easily achieved due to the exponential
growth of the graph. The problem formulation and accompanying code provide a
fast, transparent, and mathematically defined set of configurable tests to
compare the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms, in particular in
lifelong learning settings.

  Giant Water Lily Plant","45 pages",,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Victoria Amazonica plant, often known as the Giant Water Lily, has the
largest floating spherical leaf in the world, with a maximum leaf diameter of 3
meters. It spreads its leaves by the force of its spines and creates a large
shadow underneath, killing any plants that require sunlight. These water
tyrants use their formidable spines to compel each other to the surface and
increase their strength to grab more space from the surface. As they spread
throughout the pond or basin, with the earliest-growing leaves having more room
to grow, each leaf gains a unique size. Its flowers are transsexual and when
they bloom, Cyclocephala beetles are responsible for the pollination process,
being attracted to the scent of the female flower. After entering the flower,
the beetle becomes covered with pollen and transfers it to another flower for
fertilization. After the beetle leaves, the flower turns into a male and
changes color from white to pink. The male flower dies and sinks into the
water, releasing its seed to help create a new generation. In this paper, the
mathematical life cycle of this magnificent plant is introduced, and each leaf
and blossom are treated as a single entity. The proposed bio-inspired algorithm
is tested with 24 benchmark optimization test functions, such as Ackley, and
compared to ten other famous algorithms, including the Genetic Algorithm. The
proposed algorithm is tested on 10 optimization problems: Minimum Spanning
Tree, Hub Location Allocation, Quadratic Assignment, Clustering, Feature
Selection, Regression, Economic Dispatching, Parallel Machine Scheduling, Color
Quantization, and Image Segmentation and compared to traditional and
bio-inspired algorithms. Overall, the performance of the algorithm in all tasks
is satisfactory.

that combines the physical and digital worlds by allowing for seamless
interaction and communication between the two. One of the key characteristics
of a CPS is its ability to take input from its environment and use that
information to produce an output through actuators in the physical world. A
balancing robot is a prime example of a CPS, as it uses input from its sensors
to continually monitor its orientation and take action to prevent falling over
by generating thrust through its wheels or manipulating its inertia. In this
specific project, a two-wheel self-balancing robot was developed, utilizing the
concept of a reverse pendulum. A reverse pendulum by default is inherently
unstable and requires an external force to maintain its balance. In this case,
the balancing robot produces this external force through the use of wheels and
motors. To achieve precise balancing, stepper motors were utilized in the
design of the robot. Additionally, the robot has the capability to move in four
basic directions and the movement is controlled through an app connected to the
robot via Bluetooth. This allows for remote control and monitoring of the
robot's movements and actions. Overall, the development of this two-wheel
self-balancing robot serves as a demonstration of the potential and
capabilities of cyber-physical systems technology.

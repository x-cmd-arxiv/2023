  arXiv:2207.04266",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the problem of embedding the high-dimensional
spatio-spectral information of hyperspectral (HS) images efficiently and
effectively, oriented by feature diversity. To be specific, based on the
theoretical formulation that feature diversity is correlated with the rank of
the unfolded kernel matrix, we rectify 3D convolution by modifying its topology
to boost the rank upper-bound, yielding a rank-enhanced spatial-spectral
symmetrical convolution set (ReS$^3$-ConvSet), which is able to not only learn
diverse and powerful feature representations but also save network parameters.
In addition, we also propose a novel diversity-aware regularization (DA-Reg)
term, which acts directly on the feature maps to maximize the independence
among elements. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ReS$^3$-ConvSet
and DA-Reg, we apply them to various HS image processing and analysis tasks,
including denoising, spatial super-resolution, and classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches outperform
state-of-the-art methods to a significant extent both quantitatively and
qualitatively. The code is publicly available at

knowledge. Previous studies on finetuning focused on adapting only the weights
of a task-specific classifier or re-optimizing all layers of the pre-trained
model using the new task data. The first type of methods cannot mitigate the
mismatch between a pre-trained model and the new task data, and the second type
of methods easily cause over-fitting when processing tasks with limited data.
To explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning, we propose a novel block-wise
optimization mechanism, which adapts the weights of a group of layers of a
pre-trained model. In our work, the layer selection can be done in four
different ways. The first is layer-wise adaptation, which aims to search for
the most salient single layer according to the classification performance. The
second way is based on the first one, jointly adapting a small number of
top-ranked layers instead of using an individual layer. The third is block
based segmentation, where the layers of a deep network is segmented into blocks
by non-weighting layers, such as the MaxPooling layer and Activation layer. The
last one is to use a fixed-length sliding window to group layers block by
block. To identify which group of layers is the most suitable for finetuning,
the search starts from the target end and is conducted by freezing other layers
excluding the selected layers and the classification layers. The most salient
group of layers is determined in terms of classification performance. In our
experiments, the proposed approaches are tested on an often-used dataset,
Tf_flower, by finetuning five typical pre-trained models, VGG16, MobileNet-v1,
MobileNet-v2, MobileNet-v3, and ResNet50v2, respectively. The obtained results
show that the use of our proposed block-wise approaches can achieve better
performances than the two baseline methods and the layer-wise method.

obtain analytically the dynamics of a three-level system with quasidegenerate

to bypass this long-lived coherent dynamics and accelerate the relaxation to
thermal equilibration in a hyper-exponential manner, a Markovian

equilibration process manifests if the initial state is carefully prepared,
such that its coherences precisely store the amount of population relaxing from
the initial condition to the equilibrium state. Our analytical method for
solving quantum dissipative dynamics readily provides equilibration timescales,
and as such it reveals how coherent and incoherent effects interlace in the
dynamics. It further advices on how to accelerate relaxation processes, which
is desirable when long-lived quantum coherences stagnate dynamics.

for indicating supermartingale functions, which provide general certificates of
reachability that are both tight and sound. Our method uses machine learning to
train a neural certificate that minimises an upper bound for the probability of
reachability over sampled observations of the state space. Then, it uses
satisfiability modulo theories to verify that the obtained neural certificate
is valid over every possible state of the program and conversely, upon
receiving a counterexample, it refines neural training in a
counterexample-guided inductive synthesis loop, until the solver confirms the
certificate. We experimentally demonstrate on a diverse set of benchmark

supermartingales yield smaller or comparable probability bounds than existing
state-of-the-art methods in all cases, and further that the approach succeeds
on models that are entirely beyond the reach of such alternative techniques.

out-of-plane component induces a gap. This movement leads to the anisotropic
angle-dependent Andreev reflection and creates transverse conductance flows

  In this work we compare different cosmological models, determine the Hubble
constant and comment on the Hubble tension using the data from differential
ages of galaxies. The data we use is free from the systematic effects as the
absolute age estimation of the galaxies is not needed. We have used the
Bayesian approach along with the commonly used maximum likelihood method to
estimate $H_0$ and have calculated the AIC scores to compare the different
cosmological models.The non-flat cosmological model provides a higher value for
matter density as well as the Hubble constant compared to the flat $\Lambda$CDM
model. The AIC score is smaller for the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology compared to
the non-flat model indicating the flat model a better choice. The best-fit
value of $H_0$ for both these models are $68.7\pm3.1$ km/s/Mpc and $72.2\pm4$

observed at $\sim 800$au resolution in the CO $J=2\to 1$ line with the IRAM
interferometer. Our simulations take into account the observational constraints
available on the physical structure of the protostellar envelope to provide
constraints on the dynamics of the inner protostellar environment from the
study of the outflow/jet propagation away from the launch region. WALKIMYA-2D
successfully reproduces the main qualitative and quantitative features of the
Cep E outflow and the jet kinematics, naturally accounting for their time
variability. Signatures of internal shocks are detected as knots along the jet.
In the early times of the ejection process, the young emitted knots interact
with the dense circumstellar envelope through high-velocity, dissociative
shocks, which strongly decrease the CO gas abundance in the jet. As time
proceeds, the knots propagate more smoothly through the envelope and
dissociative shocks disappear after $\sim 10^3$ yr. The distribution of CO
abundance along the jet shows that the latter bears memory of the early
dissociative phase in the course of its propagation. Analysis of the velocity
field shows that the jet material mainly consists of gas entrained from the
circumstellar envelope and accelerated away from the protostar at $700$ au
scale. As a result, the overall jet mass loss rate appears higher than the
actual mass ejection rate by a factor $\sim 3$. Numerical modeling of the Cep E
jet-driven outflow and comparison with the CO observations have allowed us to
peer into the outflow formation mechanism with unprecedented detail and to

transmitter observes a dynamic source and sends updates to a remote receiver
through an error-free communication channel that suffers a random delay. We
consider two cases. In the first case, the update is guaranteed to be delivered
within a certain number of time slots. In the second case, the update is
immediately discarded once the transmission time exceeds a predetermined value.
The receiver estimates the state of the dynamic source using the received
updates. In this paper, we adopt the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) as the
performance metric and investigate the problem of optimizing the transmitter's
action in each time slot to minimize AoII. We first characterize the
optimization problem using the Markov decision process and investigate the
performance of the threshold policy, under which the transmitter transmits
updates only when the transmission is allowed and the AoII exceeds the
threshold $\tau$. By delving into the characteristics of the system evolution,
we precisely compute the expected AoII achieved by the threshold policy using
the Markov chain. Then, we prove that the optimal policy exists and provide a
computable relative value iteration algorithm to estimate the optimal policy.
Furthermore, by leveraging the policy improvement theorem, we theoretically
prove that, under an easily verifiable condition, the optimal policy is the

that has shown great success at treating electron correlation in molecules.
Here, we extend BE to treat surfaces and solids where the wave function is
represented in periodic boundary conditions using reciprocal space sums (i.e.
$k$-point sampling). The major benefit of this approach is that the resulting
fragment Hamiltonians carry no explicit dependence on the reciprocal space
sums, allowing one to apply traditional non-periodic electronic structure codes
to the fragments even though the entire system requires careful consideration
of periodic boundary conditions. Using coupled cluster singles and doubles
(CCSD) as an example method to solve the fragment Hamiltonians, we present
minimal basis set CCSD-in-HF results on 1D conducting polymers. We show that
periodic BE-CCSD can typically recover $\sim$99.9% of the electron correlation
energy. We further demonstrate that periodic BE-CCSD is feasible even for
complex donor-acceptor polymers of interest to organic solar cells - despite
the fact that the monomers are sufficiently large that even a $\Gamma-$point
periodic CCSD calculation is prohibitive. We conclude that BE is a promising
new tool for applying molecular electronic structure tools to solids and

between two static dipoles exchanging closed NG strings is attractive at all
separations. Underlining the exchange there is an emergent entropy, that is
dominated by the tachyon at large separation, and vanishes at short separation,
a measure of the confinement-deconfinement transition. The same tachyon is
dominant in the scattering amplitude, as a correlator of two Wilson loops for
two fixed dipole-like hadrons separated at large rapidity gap, where the
contribution of the worldsheet fermions is included. While the tachyon causes
the mean string bit density to grow exponentially with the rapidity, the total
scattering cross section still satisfies the Froissart bound by quantum
shadowing. The stringy scattering exchange also carries an entanglement
entropy, that saturates when the bound is reached. For hadrons with varying
dipole sizes, the tachyon exchange takes place in hyperbolic space in the
conformal limit. The result for the full S-matrix is reminiscent of the one
from Mueller$^\prime$s evolved dipole wavefunction, for the total dipole-dipole
cross section in perturbative QCD.

cooperative solution concepts, as studied in the field of cooperative game

this version of the core can be characterised using ATL*. We then study the
computational complexity of key decision problems associated with the core,
which range from problems in PSPACE to problems in 3EXPTIME. We also
investigate conditions that are sufficient to ensure that the core is
non-empty, and explore when it is invariant under bisimilarity. We then

blazar state. Using this clue, roughly a quarter of the FSRQ population has
been reported to undergo HP $\leftrightarrow$ non-HP state transition on
year-like time scales. This work examines the extent to which HP (i.e., blazar)
state can endure in a FSRQ, despite these `frequent' state transitions. This is
the first attempt to verify, using purely opto-polarimetric data for a much
enlarged sample of blazars, the recent curious finding that blazar state in
individual quasars persists for {\it at least} a few decades, despite its
changing/swinging observed fairly commonly on year-like time scales. The
present analysis is based on a well-defined sample of 83 radio quasars,
extracted from the opto-polarimetric survey RoboPol (2013-17), for which old
opto-polarimetric data taken prior to 1990 could be found in the literature. By
a source-wise comparison of these two datasets of the same observable
($p_{opt}$), we find that $\sim$ 90% of the 63 quasars found in blazar state in
our RoboPol sample, were also observed to be in that state about 3 decades
before. On the other hand, within the RoboPol survey itself, we find that
roughly a quarter of the blazars in our sample migrated to the other
polarization state on year-like time scales, by crossing the customary
$p_{opt}$ = 3% threshold. Evidently, these relatively frequent transitions (in
either direction) do not curtail the propensity of a radio quasar to retain its
blazar (i.e., HP) state for at least a few decades. The observed
transitions/swings of polarization state are probably manifestation of
transient processes, like ejections of synchrotron plasma blobs (VLBI radio
knots) from the active nucleus.

two-step transitions as a function of fluence. For even stronger field

relatively few dimensions, from each machine which is merged at the central
machine for selective inference. By reusing low-dimensional summary statistics
from local machines, our procedure achieves higher power while keeping the
communication cost low. This method is also applicable as a solution to the

O-RAN is the key enabler for the end-to-end management of cell-free massive

different radio technologies, i.e., cell-free massive MIMO and traditional
small-cell systems, in the virtualized O-RAN architecture from an end-to-end
perspective. We compare two different functional split options and different
resource orchestration mechanisms, including the fully virtualized end-to-end,
local cloud coordination-based, and radio-only resource allocation. In the
end-to-end orchestration scheme, we aim to minimize the end-to-end power
consumption by jointly allocating the radio, optical fronthaul, and virtualized

schemes: i)``radio-only'' where radio resources are optimized independently
from the cloud and ii)``local cloud coordination'' where orchestration is only
allowed among a local cluster of radio units. The spectral efficiency (SE) is
either considered as an optimization constraint for each user equipment or as a

strongly bound electron-hole pairs spontaneously form and undergo a phase
transition from a normal band insulator into an exciton condensate,
transforming the parent material into a novel correlated insulator. Despite
recent advances in spectroscopic tools, clear direct experimental evidence for
the EI state has been elusive and is often obfuscated by accompanying

demanding more measures to be taken. The #EndSARS hashtag was widely used by
the protesters to amplify their messages and reach out to wider communities on
Twitter. In this study, we present a critical analysis of how the online
protest unfolded. Essentially, we examine how the protest evolves on Twitter,
the nature of engagement with the protest themes, the factors influencing the

of vehicular transportation. However, the public's perception of cycling may be
driven by the ideologies and reporting standards of news agencies. For
instance, people may identify cyclists on the road as ""dangerous"" if news
agencies overly report cycling accidents, limiting the number of people that
cycle for transportation. Moreover, if fewer people cycle, there may be less
funding from the government to invest in safe infrastructure. In this paper, we
explore the perceived perception of cyclists within news headlines. To
accomplish this, we introduce a new dataset, ""Bike Frames"", that can help
provide insight into how headlines portray cyclists and help detect
accident-related headlines. Next, we introduce a multi-task (MT) regularization

demonstrating improvements over traditional MT frameworks. Finally, we compare

  A Mixed-Integer Optimization Approach",,,,,"physics.soc-ph math.DS math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The opioid epidemic is a crisis that has plagued the United States (US) for
decades. One central issue of the epidemic is inequitable access to treatment
for opioid use disorder (OUD), which puts certain populations at a higher risk
of opioid overdose. We integrate a predictive dynamical model and a
prescriptive optimization problem to compute the optimal locations of opioid
treatment facilities and the optimal treatment budget distribution in each US
state. Our predictive model is a differential equation-based epidemiological
model that captures the dynamics of the opioid epidemic. We use neural ordinary
differential equations to fit this model to opioid epidemic data for each state
and obtain estimates for unknown parameters in the model. We then incorporate
this epidemiological model for each state into a corresponding mixed-integer
optimization problem (MIP) for treatment facility location and resource
allocation. Our MIPs aim to minimize the number of opioid overdose deaths and
the number of people with OUD, and to target socioeconomic equitability by
considering social vulnerability (from the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index)
and opioid prescribing rates in each county. Overall, our MIPs' proposed
solutions on average decrease the number of people with OUD by 5.70 $\pm$
0.738%, increase the number of people in treatment by 21.17 $\pm$ 3.162%, and
decrease the number of opioid-related deaths by 0.51 $\pm$ 0.086% after 2 years

evaluating the effectiveness of potential policies as in past literature, our
approach provides concrete opioid treatment facility and budget allocations and
quantifies the impact of these allocations on pertinent population health
measures. Future iterations of this approach could be implemented as a

safely embedded in the FPGA unit to avoid being exposed in the Random Access

Additionally, the edge device can simultaneously publish and route a camera

Jetson Nano (NJN) and a Raspberry Pi 4 (RPI4) and it is found that the RPI4 is
the most cost-effective solution but with lower frame rate, the NJN is the
fastest because it can achieve higher frame-rate but it is not secure, and the

a highly modular and extensible system for deploying permissioned blockchains
which are expected to have a major effect on a wide range of sectors. Unlike
traditional blockchain systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric
uses the EOV model for transaction processing: the submitted transactions are
executed by the endorsing peer, ordered and batched by the ordering services,
and validated by the validating peers. Due to this EOV workflow, a
well-documented issue that arises is the multi-version concurrency control
conflict. This happens when two transactions try to writes and read the same
key in the ledger at the same time. Existing solutions to address this problem
includes eliminating blocks in favor of streaming transactions, repairing
conflicts during the ordering phase, and automatically merging the conflicting
transactions using CRDT (Conflict Free Replicated Data) techniques. In this
paper, we propose a novel solution called Early Detection for MVCC Conflicts.
Our solution detects the conflicting transactions at an early stage of the
transaction execution instead of processing them until the validation phase to
be aborted. The advantage of our solution is that it detects conflict as soon
as possible to minimize the overhead of conflicting transaction on the network
resulting in the reduction of the end-to-end transaction latency and the
increase of the system's effective throughput. We have successfully implemented
our solution in Hyperledger Fabric. We propose three different implementations
which realize early detection. Our results show that our solutions all perform
better than the baseline Fabric, with our best solution SyncMap which improves
the goodput by up to 23% and reduces the latency by up to 80%.

for high-quality virtual object rendering in mobile augmented reality (AR). In
particular, to support reflective rendering, existing methods have leveraged
deep learning models to estimate or have used physical light probes to capture
physical lighting, typically represented in the form of an environment map.
However, these methods often fail to provide visually coherent details or
require additional setups. For example, the commercial framework ARKit uses a
convolutional neural network that can generate realistic environment maps;
however the corresponding reflective rendering might not match the physical
environments. In this work, we present the design and implementation of a
lighting reconstruction framework called LitAR that enables realistic and
visually-coherent rendering. LitAR addresses several challenges of supporting
lighting information for mobile AR. First, to address the spatial variance
problem, LitAR uses two-field lighting reconstruction to divide the lighting
reconstruction task into the spatial variance-aware near-field reconstruction
and the directional-aware far-field reconstruction. The corresponding
environment map allows reflective rendering with correct color tones. Second,
LitAR uses two noise-tolerant data capturing policies to ensure data quality,
namely guided bootstrapped movement and motion-based automatic capturing.
Third, to handle the mismatch between the mobile computation capability and the
high computation requirement of lighting reconstruction, LitAR employs two
novel real-time environment map rendering techniques called multi-resolution
projection and anchor extrapolation. These two techniques effectively remove
the need of time-consuming mesh reconstruction while maintaining visual
quality.

superconductors of both the cuprate and iron-based families. It is manifested
by a fairly wide transition from the metallic to zero-resistance state.
Usually, in these strongly anisotropic materials, superconductivity (SC) first
appears as isolated domains. This leads to anisotropic excess conductivity
above Tc, and the transport measurements provide valuable information about the
SC domain structure deep within the sample. In bulk samples, this anisotropic
SC onset gives an approximate average shape of SC grains, while in thin samples
it also indicates the average size of SC grains. In this work, both interlayer
and intralayer resistivity are measured as a function of temperature in FeSe
samples of various thickness. To measure the interlayer resistivity, FeSe mesa
structures oriented across the layers were fabricated using FIB. As the sample
thickness decreases, a significant increase in superconducting transition
temperature Tc is observed: Tc raises from 8 K in bulk material to 12 K in
microbridges of thickness ~ 40 nm. We apply analytical and numerical
calculations to analyze these and earlier data and find the aspect ratio and
size of the SC domains in FeSe consistent with our resistivity and diamagnetic
response measurements. We propose a simple and fairly accurate method for
estimating the aspect ratio of SC domains from Tc anisotropy in samples of
various small thickness. The relationship between nematic and superconducting
domains in FeSe is discussed. We also generalize the analytical formulas for
conductivity in heterogeneous anisotropic superconductors to the case of
elongated SC domains of two perpendicular orientations with equal volume
fractions, corresponding to the nematic domain structure in various Fe-based
superconductors.

to identify AGN. We find the X-ray AGN fraction of post-mergers is independent

estimation, estimating joint positions from an image frame, is included because
it is often applied before classifying animal behavior. First, we provide

shaping the galaxies and their host halos is an evolving topic. The dark matter
aspects are illustrated in this work by showing distribution features in a
Milky-Way-sized halo. We focus on the halo morphology, geometry, and profile as
well as the phase space distribution using one dark matter only and five
hydrodynamical cosmological high-resolution simulations of the same halo with
different subgrid prescriptions for the baryonic physics (Kennicut versus
multi-freefall star formation and delayed cooling versus mechanical supernovae
feedback). If some general properties like the relative halo-galaxy orientation
are similar, the modifications of the gravitational potential due to the
presence of baryons are found to induce different dark matter distributions
(rounder and more concentrated halo). The mass density profile as well as the
velocity distribution are modified distinctively according to the specific
resulting baryonic distribution highlighting the variability of those
properties (e.g inner power index from 1.3 to 1.8, broader speed distribution).
The uncertainties on those features are of paramount importance for dark matter
phenomenology, particularly when dealing with dark matter dynamics or direct
and indirect detection searches. As a consequence, dark matter properties and
prospects using cosmological simulations require improvement on baryonic
physics description. Modeling such processes is a key issue not only for galaxy
formation but also for dark matter investigations.

measurement problem can't be fully extended to relativistic quantum mechanics
and quantum field theory; Wallace thus contends that as things currently stand,
only the unitary-only approaches to the measurement problem are viable.
However, the unitary-only approaches face serious epistemic problems which may
threaten their viability as solutions, and thus we consider that it remains an
urgent outstanding problem to find a viable solution to the measurement problem
which can be extended to relativistic quantum mechanics. In this article we
seek to understand in general terms what such a thing might look like. We argue
that in order to avoid serious epistemic problems, the solution must be a
single-world realist approach, and we further argue that any single-world
realist approach which is able to reproduce the predictions of relativistic
quantum mechanics will most likely have the property that our observable
reality does not supervene on dynamical, precisely-defined microscopic beables.
Thus we suggest three possible routes for further exploration: observable
reality could be approximate and emergent, as in relational quantum mechanics
with the addition of cross-perspective links, or observable reality could
supervene on beables which are not microscopically defined, as in the
consistent histories approach, or observable reality could supervene on beables
which are not dynamical, as in Kent's solution to the Lorentzian classical
reality problem. We conclude that once all of these issues are taken into

significantly narrowed down.

first introduces a Bayesian Long Short-term Memory (BLSTM) model to learn human
drivers' behaviors and habits from their historical trajectory data. The model
predicts the probability distribution of surrounding vehicles' positions, which
are used to estimate dynamic conflict risks. Next, a hybrid automaton is built
to model the basic motions of a car, and the conflict risks are assessed for
real-time state-space transitions based on environmental information. Finally,
a BLSTM-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) is built to navigate vehicles
through safe paths with the least predicted conflict risk. By merging BLSTM
with MPC, the designed neural-based MPC overcomes the defect that traditional
MPC is hard to model uncertain conflict risks. The simulation results show that
our proposed BLSTM-based MPC performs better than human drivers because it can

incrementally exploring the state space of a system. To reason about infinite
traces through a finite structure and to ultimately obtain completeness, BMC
incorporates loop conditions that revisit previously observed states. This
paper focuses on developing loop conditions for BMC of HyperLTL- a temporal
logic for hyperproperties that allows expressing important policies for
security and consistency in concurrent systems, etc. Loop conditions for
HyperLTL are more complicated than for LTL, as different traces may loop
inconsistently in unrelated moments. Existing BMC approaches for HyperLTL only
considered linear unrollings without any looping capability, which precludes
both finding small infinite traces and obtaining a complete technique. We
investigate loop conditions for HyperLTL BMC, where the HyperLTL formula can
contain up to one quantifier alternation. We first present a general complete
automata-based technique which is based on bounds of maximum unrollings. Then,
we introduce alternative simulation-based algorithms that allow exploiting
short loops effectively, generating SAT queries whose satisfiability guarantees
the outcome of the original model checking problem. We also report empirical
evaluation of the prototype implementation of our BMC techniques using Z3py.

  under Dynamic Memberships in V2X",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents V-Guard, a new permissioned blockchain that achieves
consensus for vehicular data under changing memberships, targeting the problem
in V2X networks where vehicles are often intermittently connected on the roads.
To achieve this goal, V-Guard integrates membership management into the
consensus process for agreeing on data entries. It binds a data entry with a
membership configuration profile that describes responsible vehicles for
achieving consensus for the data entry. As such, V-Guard produces chained
consensus results of both data entries and their residing membership profiles,
which enables consensus to be achieved seamlessly under changing memberships.
In addition, V-Guard separates the ordering of transactions from consensus,
allowing concurrent ordering instances and periodic consensus instances to
order and commit data entries. These features make V-Guard efficient for
achieving consensus under dynamic memberships with high throughput and latency
performance.

series of new bounds for the cardinality of Hausdorff spaces and regular spaces
that do not involve $\psi_c(X)$ nor its variants at all. For example, we show
if $X$ is regular then $|X|\leq 2^{c(X)^{\pi\chi(X)}}$ and $|X|\leq
2^{c(X)\pi\chi(X)^{ot(X)}}$, where the cardinal function $ot(X)$, introduced by
Tkachenko, has the property $ot(X)\leq\min\{t(X),c(X)\}$. It follows from the
latter that a regular space with cellularity at most $\mathfrak{c}$ and
countable $\pi$-character has cardinality at most $2^\mathfrak{c}$. For a
Hausdorff space $X$ we show $|X|\leq 2^{d(X)^{\pi\chi(X)}}$, $|X|\leq
d(X)^{\pi\chi(X)^{ot(X)}}$, and $|X|\leq 2^{\pi w(X)^{dot(X)}}$, where
$dot(X)\leq\min\{ot(X),\pi\chi(X)\}$. None of these bounds involve $\psi_c(X)$
or $\psi(X)$. By introducing the cardinal functions $w\psi_c(X)$ and
$d\psi_c(X)$ with the property $w\psi_c(X)d\psi_c(X)\leq\psi_c(X)$ for a
Hausdorff space $X$, we show $|X|\leq\pi\chi(X)^{c(X)w\psi_c(X)}$ if $X$ is
regular and $|X|\leq\pi\chi(X)^{c(X)d\psi_c(X)w\psi_c(X)}$ if $X$ is Hausdorff.
This improves results of Sapirovskii and Sun. It is also shown that if $X$ is
Hausdorff then $|X|\leq 2^{d(X)w\psi_c(X)}$, which appears to be new even in
the case where $w\psi_c(X)$ is replaced with $\psi_c(X)$. Compact examples show
that $\psi(X)$ cannot be replaced with $d\psi_c(X)w\psi_c(X)$ in the bound
$2^{\psi(X)}$ for the cardinality of a compact Hausdorff space $X$. Likewise,
$\psi(X)$ cannot be replaced with $d\psi_c(X)w\psi_c(X)$ in the
Arhangel'skii-Sapirovskii bound $2^{L(X)t(X)\psi(X)}$ for the cardinality of a
Hausdorff space $X$. Finally, we make several observations concerning
homogeneous spaces in this connection.

problem, where the distributions to steer are arbitrary. In the literature, the
distribution steering problem governed by system dynamics is usually treated by
assuming the distribution of the system states to be Gaussian. In our previous
paper, we considered the distribution steering problem where the initial and
terminal distributions are arbitrary (only required to have first several
orders of power moments), and proposed to use the moments to turn this problem
into a finite-dimensional one. We put forward a moment representation of the
primal system for control. However, the control law in that paper was an
empirical one without optimization towards a design criterion, which doesn't
always ensure a most satisfactory solution. In this paper, which is a very
preliminary version, we propose a convex optimization approach to the general
distribution steering problem of the first-order discrete-time linear system,
i.e., an optimal control law for the corresponding moment system. The optimal
control inputs of the moment system are obtained by convex optimization, of
which the convexity of the domain is proved. An algorithm of distribution
steering is then put forward by extending a realization scheme of control
inputs using the Kullback-Leibler distance to one realization using the squared
Hellinger distance, of which the performance has been shown to be better than
the former one. Experiments on different types of cost functions are given to
validate the performance of our proposed algorithm. Since the moment system is
a dimension-reduced counterpart of the primal system, and we are not optimizing
the cost function over all feasible control inputs, we call this solution a
sub-optimal one to the primal general distribution steering problem.

the optimal query complexity in time $t$ and desirable accuracy $\varepsilon$,
generic time-dependent Hamiltonians face at larger query complexity and more

Hamiltonians with multiple time-periodicity. Such time-dependent Hamiltonians
involve a variety of nonequilibrium systems such as time-periodic systems

low-frequency gravitational wave (GW) sources. As potential low-frequency GW
sources, neutron star/white dwarf (WD) ultra-compact X-ray binaries (UCXBs)
have been investigated extensively. Using the MESA code, we systematically
explored the evolution of black hole (BH)-main sequence star (MS) binaries to
diagnose whether their descendants can be detected by space-borne GW detectors.
Our simulations show that BH-MS binaries with an initial orbital period less
than the bifurcation period can evolve into BH UCXBs that can be detected by
LISA. Such an evolutionary channel would form compact mass-transferring BH-WD
systems rather than detached BH-WD systems. The calculated X-ray luminosities
of BH UCXBs detected by LISA at a distance $d=1$ kpc are
$\sim10^{33}-10^{35}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ ($\sim10^{34}-10^{35}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$
for $d=10$ kpc), hence it is possible to detect their electromagnetic
counterparts. It is worth emphasizing only some BH-MS systems with an initial
orbital period very close to the bifurcation period can evolve toward
low-frequency GW sources whose chirp masses can be measured. The maximum GW
frequency of BH UCXBs forming by BH-MS pathway is about 3 mHz, which is smaller
than the minimum GW frequency (6.4 mHz) of mass-transferring BH-WD originating
from a dynamic process. Furthermore, we obtain an initial parameter space
(donor-star masses and orbital periods) of progenitors of BH UCXB-GW sources,
which can be applied to future population synthesis simulations. By a rough
estimation, we predict that LISA could detect only a few BH UCXB-GW sources
forming by the BH-MS channel.

exoskeletons, it is challenging to measure interaction forces as it is not
feasible to implement force/torque sensors at every contact between the user
and the exoskeleton. Moreover, it is important to compensate for the
exoskeleton's whole-body gravitational and dynamical forces. Previous works
either simplified the dynamic model by treating the legs as independent double
pendulums, or they did not close the loop with interaction force feedback.
  This paper presents a novel method to calculate interaction torques during
the complete gait cycle by using whole-body dynamics and joint torque
measurements on a hip-knee exoskeleton. Furthermore, we propose a constrained
optimization scheme combined with a virtual model controller to track desired
interaction torques in a closed loop while considering physical limits and
safety considerations. Together, we call this approach whole-exoskeleton
closed-loop compensation (WECC) control. We evaluated the haptic transparency
and spring-damper rendering performance of WECC control on three subjects. We
also compared the performance of WECC with a controller based on a simplified
dynamic model and a passive version of the exoskeleton with disassembled
drives. The WECC controller resulted in consistent interaction torque tracking
during the whole gait cycle for both zero and nonzero desired interaction
torques. On the contrary, the simplified controller failed to track desired
interaction torques during the stance phase. The proposed interaction force
control method is especially beneficial for heavy lower-limb exoskeletons where
the dynamics of the entire exoskeleton should be compensated.

memoryless symmetric channels and have a comparable performance to that of
random codes in terms of scaling laws. However, they lack efficient decoders
with performance close to that of a maximum-likelihood decoder for general code
parameters. Also, they only admit limited sets of rates. In this paper, we
focus on subcodes of RM codes with flexible rates. We first extend the
recently-introduced recursive projection-aggregation (RPA) decoding algorithm
to RM subcodes. To lower the complexity of our decoding algorithm, referred to
as subRPA, we investigate different approaches to prune the projections. Next,
we derive the soft-decision based version of our algorithm, called soft-subRPA,
that not only improves upon the performance of subRPA but also enables a
differentiable decoding algorithm. Building upon the soft-subRPA algorithm, we
then provide a framework for training a machine learning (ML) model to search
for \textit{good} sets of projections that minimize the decoding error rate.
Training our ML model enables achieving very close to the performance of
full-projection decoding with a significantly smaller number of projections. We
also show that the choice of the projections in decoding RM subcodes matters
significantly, and our ML-aided projection pruning scheme is able to find a
\textit{good} selection, i.e., with negligible performance degradation compared
to the full-projection case, given a reasonable number of projections.

assumption that the variability seen in AGN is constrained by the speed of
light during a flare event and can therefore be used to estimate the size of an
emitting region. A limitation of this method is that previously, the Doppler
factor was required to be known. In this paper, we derive an extension of the
`standard speed-gun' method for measuring cosmological distances that depends
on the maximum intrinsic brightness temperature that a source can reach, rather
than the Doppler factor. If the precise value of the intrinsic brightness
temperature does not evolve with redshift and flares are statistically
independent, we can in principle improve the errors in measurements of the
matter content of the universe (in a flat LambdaCDM model) statistically. We
then explored how well a future observing program would constrain cosmological
parameters. We found that recovering the input cosmology depends critically on
the uncertainty of the intrinsic brightness temperature and the number of

with a minimal theoretical model by using linear response theory for a linearly

natural (e.g., ice formation, steam generation) and engineering processes
(e.g., casting, welding, additive manufacturing). Almost all phase change
materials (PCMs) exhibit density/volume changes during melting, solidification,
boiling, or condensation, causing additional fluid flow during this transition.
Most numerical works consider only two phase flows (either solid-liquid or
liquid-gas) for modeling phase change phenomena and some also neglect
volume/density change of PCMs in the models. This paper presents a novel low
Mach enthalpy method for simulating solidification and melting problems with
variable thermophysical properties, including density. Additionally, this
formulation allows coupling a solid-liquid PCM with a gas phase in order to
simulate the free surface dynamics of PCMs undergoing melting and
solidification. We revisit the two-phase Stefan problem involving a density
jump between two material phases. We propose a possible means to include the
kinetic energy jump in the Stefan condition while still allowing for an
analytical solution. The new low Mach enthalpy method is validated against
analytical solutions for a PCM undergoing a large density change during its
phase transition. Additionally, a few simple sanity checks are proposed to
benchmark computational fluid dynamics (CFD) algorithms that aim to capture the
volume change effects of PCMs.

we establish a simple margin condition that only depends only on the

similar margin quantity and complexity measures is also necessary for model
consistency of BSS. For a broader understanding of the complexity measures, we
also consider some simple illustrative examples to demonstrate the variation in
the complexity measures which broadens our theoretical understanding of the

performance of GAT and the number of layers, which is a critical issue in
guiding model performance improvement. In this paper, we perform a systematic

the number of layers increases is the oversquashing phenomenon; (2) among the
previous improvements applied to the GNN model, only the residual connection

oversquashing and thus improves the deep GAT model performance. This provides
empirical insights and guidelines for researchers to design the GAT variant

atomisation processes, but the shear effect in non-uniform airflow is rarely
reported. In this study, the deformation and breakup of droplets in a shear
flow of air is investigated experimentally using high-speed imaging, digital
image processing, and particle image velocimetry. The results show that in
airflow with a strong shear effect, the droplet breakup exhibits unique
features due to the uplift and stretching produced by the interaction between
the deformed droplet and the shear layer. The breakup process can be divided
into three stages according to the droplet morphology and the breakup
mechanism, namely the sheet breakup, the swing breakup, and the rim breakup
stages. Theoretical analysis reveals that the swing breakup is governed by the
transverse Rayleigh-Taylor instability. A regime map of the droplet breakup is
produced, and the transitions between different regimes are obtained
theoretically. The stretching liquid film during the droplet deformation and
the fragment size distribution after droplet breakup are analysed
quantitatively, and the results show that they are determined by the
competition of breakup at different stages affected by the shear. Finally, the
effect of the droplet viscosity is investigated, and the viscosity inhibits the
droplet breakup in a strong shear airflow.

influences the flow dynamics past a transversely forced oscillating cylinder in
the laminar vortex shedding regime at a fixed Reynolds number of 100. In
particular, we examine how fluid viscoelasticity influences the boundary
between the lock-in and no lock-in zones and the associated wake topology
compared to that seen in a simple Newtonian fluid. All in all, we find that the
fluid viscoelasticity facilitates the synchronization of the vortex street with
the cylinder motion at lower oscillation frequencies than that required for a
Newtonian fluid. Consequently, the boundary of the lock-in region for a
viscoelastic fluid differs from the Newtonian one and broadens in the
non-dimensional cylinder oscillation amplitude and frequency plane.
Furthermore, we propose that excess strain generated due to the stretching of
polymer molecules in a viscoelastic fluid results in a marked difference in the
wake structure from that seen in a Newtonian fluid. For a Newtonian fluid, only
2S (two single vortices) and P+S (a pair and a single vortex) vortex shedding
modes are detected in the primary synchronization region. However, a 2P(two
pairs of vortices) vortex mode is detected for a viscoelastic fluid in this
region. We also employ the data-driven dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) reduced
order modeling technique to extract and analyze underlying coherent flow
structures and their associated frequencies to understand the differences in
the flow dynamics of Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids past an oscillating

value} baseline allows on-policy stochastic \emph{natural} policy gradient
(NPG) to converge to a globally optimal policy at an $O(1/t)$ rate, which was
not previously known. The analysis relies on two novel findings: the expected
progress of the NPG update satisfies a stochastic version of the non-uniform
\L{}ojasiewicz (N\L{}) inequality, and with probability 1 the state value
baseline prevents the optimal action's probability from vanishing, thus
ensuring sufficient exploration. Importantly, these results provide a new
understanding of the role of baselines in stochastic policy gradient: by
showing that the variance of natural policy gradient estimates remains
unbounded with or without a baseline, we find that variance reduction
\emph{cannot} explain their utility in this setting. Instead, the analysis
reveals that the primary effect of the value baseline is to \textbf{reduce the
aggressiveness of the updates} rather than their variance. That is, we
demonstrate that a finite variance is \emph{not necessary} for almost sure
convergence of stochastic NPG, while controlling update aggressiveness is both
necessary and sufficient. Additional experimental results verify these
theoretical findings.

motion and transferred simultaneously. However, the entanglement sets up a
barrier for these methods to be used in video portrait editing directly, where
it may require to modify the expression only while maintaining the pose
unchanged. One challenge of decoupling pose and expression is the lack of
paired data, such as the same pose but different expressions. Only a few
methods attempt to tackle this challenge with the feat of 3D Morphable Models
(3DMMs) for explicit disentanglement. But 3DMMs are not accurate enough to
capture facial details due to the limited number of Blenshapes, which has side
effects on motion transfer. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-supervised
disentanglement framework to decouple pose and expression without 3DMMs and
paired data, which consists of a motion editing module, a pose generator, and
an expression generator. The editing module projects faces into a latent space
where pose motion and expression motion can be disentangled, and the pose or
expression transfer can be performed in the latent space conveniently via
addition. The two generators render the modified latent codes to images,
respectively. Moreover, to guarantee the disentanglement, we propose a
bidirectional cyclic training strategy with well-designed constraints.
Evaluations demonstrate our method can control pose or expression independently

related to the nontrivial nature of orbital magnetoelectric coupling, the role
of boundaries remains ambiguous in this formalism. Based on a bilayer model
with an adjustable Chern number at half filling, we numerically investigate the
OM with the above two different average types under a nonzero perpendicular
electric field. The result shows that in this case, the nonzero Chern number
gives rise to a gauge shift of the OM with the bulk region average, while this
gauge shift is absent for the OM with the whole sample average. This indicates
that only the whole sample average is reliable to calculate the OM under a
nonzero electric field for Chern insulators. On this basis, the orbital
magnetoelectric polarizablity (OMP) and the Chern-Simons orbital

alternative proofs for the well-known exponentially-strong converse bounds for
almost lossless source-coding with side-information and for channel coding over
a discrete memoryless channel (DMC). These alternative proofs are solely based
on a change of measure argument on the sets of conditionally or jointly typical
sequences that result in a correct decision, and on the analysis of these
measures in the asymptotic regime of infinite blocklengths. The paper also
presents a new exponentially-strong converse for the K-hop hypothesis testing
against independence problem with certain Markov chains and a strong converse
for the two-terminal Lround interactive compression problem with multiple
distortion constraints that depend on both sources and both reconstructions.
This latter problem includes as special cases the Wyner-Ziv problem, the
interactive function computation problem, and the compression with lossy common
reconstruction problem. These new strong converse proofs are derived using
similar change of measure arguments as described above and by additionally
proving that certain Markov chains involving auxiliary random variables hold in
the asymptotic regime of infinite blocklengths. As shown in related
publications, the same method also yields converse bounds under expected
resource constraints.

problem by searching for an optimal feature transformation to learn a

that the motion pattern of the pen is different for writing on paper and on
tablet. This becomes visible in the sensor data for online handwriting (OnHW)
from pens with integrated inertial measurement units. This paper proposes a
supervised DA approach to enhance learning for OnHW recognition between tablet

discrepancy and correlation alignment to learn a domain-invariant feature
representation (i.e., similar covariances between tablet and paper features).
We use a triplet loss that takes negative samples of the auxiliary domain

environment--is a common occurrence in the real world. Novelty adaptation is an
agent's ability to improve its policy performance post-novelty. Most
reinforcement learning (RL) methods assume that the world is a closed, fixed
process. Consequentially, RL policies adapt inefficiently to novelties. To
address this, we introduce WorldCloner, an end-to-end trainable neuro-symbolic
world model for rapid novelty adaptation. WorldCloner learns an efficient
symbolic representation of the pre-novelty environment transitions, and uses
this transition model to detect novelty and efficiently adapt to novelty in a
single-shot fashion. Additionally, WorldCloner augments the policy learning
process using imagination-based adaptation, where the world model simulates
transitions of the post-novelty environment to help the policy adapt. By
blending ''imagined'' transitions with interactions in the post-novelty
environment, performance can be recovered with fewer total environment
interactions. Using environments designed for studying novelty in sequential
decision-making problems, we show that the symbolic world model helps its
neural policy adapt more efficiently than model-based and model-based

While often modeled based on limit equilibrium analysis, finite or discrete
elements, continuum particle-based approaches like the Material Point Method
(MPM) have more recently been successful in modeling their full 3D
elasto-plastic behavior. In this paper, we develop a depth-averaged Material
Point Method (DAMPM) to efficiently simulate shallow landslides over complex
topography based on both material properties and terrain characteristics. DAMPM
is an adaptation of MPM with classical shallow water assumptions, thus enabling
large-deformation elasto-plastic modeling of landslides in a computationally
efficient manner. The model is here demonstrated on the release of snow slab
avalanches, a specific type of shallow landslides which release due to crack
propagation within a weak layer buried below a cohesive slab. Here, the weak
layer is considered as an external shear force acting at the base of an
elastic-brittle slab. We validate our model against previous analytical
calculations and numerical simulations of the classical snow fracture
experiment known as Propagation Saw Test (PST). Furthermore, large scale
simulations are conducted to evaluate the shape and size of avalanche release
zones over different topographies. Given the low computational cost compared to
3D MPM, we expect our work to have important operational applications in hazard
assessment, in particular for the evaluation of release areas, a crucial input
for geophysical mass flow models. Our approach can be easily adapted to
simulate both the initiation and dynamics of various shallow landslides, debris
and lava flows, glacier creep and calving.

of freedom for materials design and discovery. The development of
compositionally complex oxides with superior functional properties has been
largely empirical and serendipitous, in part due to the exceedingly complex
chemistry and structure of solid solutions that span a range of length scales.
The classical molecular dynamics (MD), as a powerful statistical method to
investigate materials properties over large spatial and temporal scales, often
plays a secondary role in computer-aided materials discovery because of the
limited availability and accuracy of classical force fields. Here, we introduce
the strategy of ``modular developing deep potential"" (ModDP) that enables a
systematic development and improvement of deep neural network-based model
potential, termed as deep potential, for complex solid solutions with minimum
human intervention. The converged training database associated with an
end-member material is treated as an independent module and is reused to train
the deep potential of solid solutions via a concurrent learning procedure. We
apply ModDP to obtain classical force fields of two technologically important
solid solutions, Pb$_x$Sr$_{1-x}$TiO$_3$ and Hf$_x$Zr$_{1-x}$O$_2$. For both
materials systems, a single model potential is capable of predicting various
properties of solid solutions including temperature-driven and
composition-driven phase transitions over a wide range of compositions. In
particular, the deep potential of Pb$_x$Sr$_{1-x}$TiO$_3$ reproduces a few
known topological textures such as polar vortex lattice and electric dipole
waves in PbTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ superlattices, paving the way for MD
investigations on the dynamics of topological structures in response to

personal exposure to airborne particulate matter of aerodynamic sizes less than

continuous respiratory rate (breaths per minute) measured by the Respeck

that seeks to find flat minima in deep learning, resulting in state-of-the-art

convergence instability that occurs near a saddle point. Utilizing the
qualitative theory of dynamical systems, we explain how SAM becomes stuck in
the saddle point and then theoretically prove that the saddle point can become
an attractor under SAM dynamics. Additionally, we show that this convergence
instability can also occur in stochastic dynamical systems by establishing the
diffusion of SAM. We prove that SAM diffusion is worse than that of vanilla
gradient descent in terms of saddle point escape. Further, we demonstrate that
often overlooked training tricks, momentum and batch-size, are important to
mitigate the convergence instability and achieve high generalization

features. To this end, the reflectance maps, which contain the spectral
signatures and related abundances of the materials in the observed scene, are
often used. However, due to the low spatial resolution of most hyperspectral

different sub-pixel targets (including the background spectrum) are mixed
together within the same pixel. To solve this issue, in this paper, we adopt a
generalized replacement model accounting for multiple sub-pixel target spectra
and formulate the detection problem at hand as a binary hypothesis test where
under the alternative hypothesis the target is modeled in terms of a linear
combination of endmembers whose coefficients also account for the presence of

generalized likelihood ratio test where the unknown parameters are suitably

60~TeV with intensity comparable to a predicted upper limit to the flux from
extra-galactic sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays. More recent results
provide the first strong evidence of a standalone neutrino source and a highly

IceCube indicate that neutrino astronomy can complement photon astronomy also
providing insights into opaque sources of high-energy radiation. Starburst

from such a point of view, we investigate the scientific value of the modern

cosmological models motivates the scientific community to search for
alternative cosmological scenarios that could resolve the $H_0$ tension. In
this regard, we aim to work on a torsion-based modified theory of gravity which
is an alternative description to the coherence model. We find an analytic
solution of the Hubble parameter using a linear Lagrangian function of torsion
$T$ and trace of energy-momentum tensor $\mathcal{T}$ for the dust case.
Further, we constrain the cosmological and model parameters; to do that, we use
Hubble and Pantheon samples and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation
through Bayesian statistics. We obtain the values of Hubble constant as $H_0=
69.9\pm 6.8$ km$s^{-1}$ Mp$c^{-1}$, $H_0= 70.3\pm 6.3$ km$s^{-1}$ Mp$c^{-1}$,
and $H_0= 71.4\pm 6.3$ km$s^{-1}$ Mp$c^{-1}$ at 68\% confidence level (CL), for
Hubble, Pantheon, and their combine analysis, respectively. These outputs of
$H_0$ for our model align with the recent observational measurements of $H_0$.

at 800 nm in N2 gas, we generate a vortex superfluorescent radiation of N2+ at
391 nm, which carries the same photon orbital angular momentum as the pump
beam. With the injection of a Gaussian seed beam at 391 nm, the coherent
radiation is amplified, but the vorticity is unchanged. A new physical
mechanism is revealed in the vortex N2+ superfluorescent radiation: the vortex
pump beam transfers the spatial spiral phase into the N2+ gain medium, and the
Gaussian seed beam picks up the spatial spiral phase and is then amplified into
a vortex beam. Moreover, when we employ a pump beam with a cylindrical vector
mode, the Gaussian seed beam is correspondingly amplified into a cylindrical
vector beam. Surprisingly, the spatial polarization state of the amplified
radiation is identical to that of the vector pump beam regardless of whether
the Gaussian seed beam is linearly, elliptically, or circularly polarized.
Solving three-dimensional coupled wave equations, we show how a Gaussian beam
becomes a cylindrical vector beam in a cylindrically symmetric gain medium.
This study provides a novel approach to generating structured light via N2+ air

performing Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) and physical experiments. The
present results show that the sedimentation processes are significantly
influenced by disk shape, characterized by a dimensionless moment of inertia
I*, and Reynolds number of the leading disk Re. For the flatter disks with
smaller I*, steady falling with enduring contact transits to periodic swinging
with intermittent contacts as Re increases. The disks with larger I* tend to
fall in a Drafting-Kissing-Tumbling (DKT) mode at low Re and to remain
separated at high Re. Based on I* and Re, a phase diagram is created to
classify the two-disk falling into ten distinctive patterns. The planar motion

Turbulent disturbance flows at a high Re contribute to the chaotic
three-dimensional rotation of the disks. The chance for the two disks to
contact is increased when I* and Re are reduced.

many of the current approaches suffer from certain shortcomings, such as
relying on hand-picked thresholds.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to estimate architectural
technical debt principal based on machine learning and architectural smells to
address such shortcomings. Our approach can estimate the amount of technical
debt principal generated by a single architectural smell instance. To do so, we
adopt novel techniques from Information Retrieval to train a learning-to-rank
machine learning model that estimates the severity of an architectural smell
and ensure the transparency of the predictions. Then, for each instance, we
statically analyse the source code to calculate the exact number of lines of
code creating the smell. Finally, we combine these two values to calculate the
technical debt principal.
  To validate the approach, we conducted a case study and interviewed 16
practitioners, from both open source and industry, and asked them about their
opinions on the TD principal estimations for several smells detected in their
projects. The results show that for 71\% of instances, practitioners agreed
that the estimations provided were \emph{representative} of the effort
necessary to refactor the smell.

wavelength substantially larger than the period of the antidots array the
radiation causes a polarization-independent spin-polarized ratchet current. The
current is generated by the periodic asymmetric radiation intensity
distribution caused by the near-field diffraction at the edges of the antidots,
which induces spatially inhomogeneous periodic electron gas heating, and a
phase-shifted periodic asymmetric electrostatic force. The developed
microscopic theory shows that the magnetization of the Co/Pt film results in a
spin ratchet current caused by both the anomalous Hall and the anomalous Nernst
effects. Additionally, we observed a polarization-dependent trigonal spin
photocurrent, which is caused by the scattering of electrons at the antidot
boundaries resulting in a spin-polarized current due to the magnetization.
Microscopic theory of these effects reveals that the trigonal photocurrent is
generated at the boundaries of the triangle antidots, whereas the spin ratchet
is generated due to the spatially periodic temperature gradient over the whole
film. This difference causes substantially different hysteresis widths of these
two currents.

from the team's MIRI Working Group. Overall we find that MIRI's performance for
phase curve observations is excellent, with a few minor caveats. The key
takeaways for Cycle 2 planning with MIRI/LRS are: (1) long-duration
observations (> 24 hours) have now been successfully executed; (2) for phase
curves, we recommend including a one-hour burn-in period prior to taking
science data to mitigate the effects of the ramp systematic; and (3) we do not
yet recommend partial phase curve observations. In addition, we also find that:
the position of the spectrum on the detector is stable to within 0.03 pixels
over the full 26.5-hour observation; the light curves typically show a
systematic downward ramp that is strongest for the first 30 minutes, but
continues to decay for hours; from 10.6-11.8 microns, the ramp effect has
remarkably different behavior, possibly due to a different illumination history
for the affected region of the detector; after trimming the integrations most
affected by the initial ramps and correcting the remaining systematics with
analytic models, we obtain residuals to the light-curve fits that are typically
within 25% of the photon noise limit for 0.5-micron spectroscopic bins;
non-linearity correction is not a significant source of additional noise for
WASP-43, though it may be an issue for brighter targets; the gain value of 5.5
electrons/DN currently on CRDS and JDox is known to be incorrect, and the
current best estimate for the gain is approximately 3.1 electrons/DN; new
reference files for the JWST calibration pipeline reflecting these findings are
under development at STScI.

agents, owing to the wide availability of absorption-contrast laboratory source
microCT compared to phase contrast capable devices. Standard commercial
contrast agents used in angiography are not suitable for high-resolution
imaging ex vivo, however, as they are small molecular compounds capable of
diffusing through blood vessel walls within minutes. Large nanoparticle-based
blood pool contrast agents on the other hand exhibit problems with aggregation,
resulting in clogging in the smallest blood vessels. Injection with solidifying
plastic resins has, therefore, remained the gold standard for microvascular
imaging, despite the considerable amount of training and optimization needed to
properly perfuse the viscous compounds. Even with optimization, frequent gas
and water inclusions commonly result in interrupted vessel segments. This lack
of suitable compounds has led us to develop the polymeric, cross-linkable X-ray
contrast agent XlinCA. As a water-soluble organic molecule, aggregation and
inclusions are inherently avoided. High molecular weight allows it to be
retained even in the highly fenestrated vasculature of the kidney filtration
system. It can be covalently crosslinked using the same aldehydes used in
tissue fixation protocols, leading to stable and permanent contrast. These
properties allowed us to image whole mice and individual organs in 6 to
12-month-old C57BL/6J mice without requiring lengthy optimizations of injection
rates and pressures, while at the same time achieving greatly improved filling
of the vasculature compared to resin-based vascular casting. This work aims at
illuminating the rationales, processes and challenges involved in creating this
recently developed contrast agent.

hot topic recently. Here we study the vestigial phases of a class of materials
made through stacking a homo-bilayer with the largest twist angle, dubbed as
the twist-bilayer quasi-crystal (TB-QC), exampled by the 45$^\circ$-twisted
bilayer cuprates and 30$^\circ$-twisted bilayer graphene. When each mononlayer
hosts a pairing state with the largest pairing angular momentum, e.g. $d$-wave
for the cuprates or $f$-wave for some members in the graphene family, previous
studies yield that the second-order interlayer Josephson coupling would drive
chiral $d+id$ or $f+if$ topological superconductivity (TSC) in the TB-QC. Here
we propose that, above the $T_c$ of the chiral TSC phase, either the total- or
relative- pairing phase of the two layers can be unilateral quasi-ordered or
ordered. In the form case, a Cooper pair from the top layer pairs with a Cooper
pair from the bottom layer to form the charge-4e SC; in the latter case, a
time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral metal phase is formed. Based on a
thorough symmetry analysis, we arrive at the low-energy effective Hamiltonian
describing the pairing-phase fluctuations. Our combined renormalization group
and Monte-Carlo studies reveal the presence of the charge-4e SC and chiral
metal phases in certain regimes in the phase diagram. These vestigial phases

quality factor $Q_l$. The resonance quality factor consists of both internal
(material) losses as well as coupling losses when resonance photons escape back
into the measurement circuit. The combined losses are then described as
$Q_l^{-1} = Q_c^{-1} + Q_i^{-1}$, where $Q_c$ and $Q_i$ reflect the coupling

relative contributions of $Q_i$ and $Q_c$ to $Q_l$, diameter-correcting circle
fits use algebraic or geometric means to fit the resonance signal on the

factor values from $Q_i \ll Q_c$ to $Q_c \ll Q_i$. In addition, we develop a
novel measurement protocol that can not only reduce fitting errors by factors

so larger populations can be effectively screened. This calls for training and
education protocols attuned specifically to this modality. Like training in
other modalities such as traditional endoscopy, CT, MRI, etc., a WCE training
protocol would require an atlas comprising of a large corpora of images that
show vivid descriptions of pathologies and abnormalities, ideally observed over
a period of time. Since such comprehensive atlases are presently lacking in
WCE, in this work, we propose a deep learning method for utilizing already
available studies across different institutions for the creation of a realistic
WCE atlas using StyleGAN. We identify clinically relevant attributes in WCE
such that synthetic images can be generated with selected attributes on cue.
Beyond this, we also simulate several disease progression scenarios. The
generated images are evaluated for realism and plausibility through three

experts from three geographical locations and a variety of years of experience.
The results from the experiments indicate that the images are highly realistic

  Society. 18 pages, 14 figures",,"10.1093/mnras/stad163",,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present a rapid timing analysis of optical (HiPERCAM and ULTRACAM) and
X-ray (NICER) observations of the X-ray transient Swift J1858.6-0814 during
2018 and 2019. The optical light curves show relatively slow, large amplitude
(~1 mags in g$_s$) `blue' flares (i.e. stronger at shorter wavelengths) on
time-scales of ~minutes as well as fast, small amplitude (~0.1 mag in g$_s$)
`red' flares (i.e. stronger at longer wavelengths) on time-scales of ~seconds.
The `blue' and `red' flares are consistent with X-ray reprocessing and
optically thin synchrotron emission, respectively, similar to what is observed
in other X-ray binaries. The simultaneous optical versus soft- and hard-band
X-ray light curves show time- and energy dependent correlations.
  The 2019 March 4 and parts of the June data show a nearly symmetric positive
cross correlations (CCFs) at positive lags consistent with simple X-ray disc
reprocessing. The soft- and hard-band CCFs are similar and can be reproduced if
disc reprocessing dominates in the optical and one component (disc or
synchrotron Comptonization) dominates both the soft and hard X-rays. A part of
the 2019 June data shows a very different CCFs. The observed positive
correlation at negative lag in the soft-band can be reproduced if the optical
synchrotron emission is correlated with the hot flow X-ray emission.
  The observed timing properties are in qualitative agreement with the hybrid
inner hot accretion flow model, where the relative role of the different X-ray
and optical components that vary during the course of the outburst, as well as
on shorter time-scales, govern the shape of the optical/X-ray CCFs.

power-law grain-size distribution method into a numerical multifluid MHD code
as described in Sumpter (2020). Such a description allows to capture the full
size range of dust grains and their dynamical effects. The only assumptions are
that grains within a single discrete bin have the same velocity and charge. We
test the implementation by modelling plane-parallel C-type shocks and compare
the results with shock models of multispecies grain models. We find that both
the discrete and multispecies grain models converge to the same shock profile.
However, the convergence for the discrete models is faster than for the
multispecies grain models. For the pure advection models a single discrete bin
is sufficient, while the multispecies grain models need a minimum of 8 grain
species. When including grain sputtering the necessary number of discrete bins
increases to 4, as the grain distribution cannot be described by a single
power-law as in the advection models. The multispecies grain models still need
more grain species to model the distribution, but the number does not increase
compared to the pure advection models. Our results show that modelling the
grain distribution function using a discrete distribution reduces the
computational cost needed to capture the grain physics significantly.

display individual features not representative of their classes. Yet, the
problem becomes more complicated when some of the given shots display multiple
objects. In this paper, we present a strategy which aims at detecting the
presence of multiple and previously unseen objects in a given shot. This
methodology is based on identifying the corners of a simplex in a high

ability to successfully detect multiple (previously unseen) objects in raw

presence of multiple objects to improve the performance of few-shot
classification, in the case of extreme settings where only one shot is given

the proposed method to slightly, yet statistically significantly, improve

order in wave steepness is derived, and used to analyze statistical properties
of surface waves; the theory extends the classic theory by Longuet-Higgins [J.
Fluid Mech. 12, 3 (1962)] to allow for an arbitrary depth-dependent background
flow, $U(z)$, with $U$ the horizontal velocity along the main direction of wave
propagation and $z$ the vertical axis. Numerical statistics are collected from
a large number of realisations of random, irregular sea-states following a
JONSWAP spectrum, on linear and exponential model currents of varying
strengths. A number of statistical quantities are presented and compared to a
range of theoretical expressions from the literature; in particular the
distribution of wave surface elevation, surface maxima, and crest height; the
exceedance probability including the probability of rogue waves; the maximum
crest height among $N_s$ waves, and the skewness of the surface elevation
distribution. We find that compared to no-shear conditions, opposing vertical
shear ($U'(z)>0$) leads to increased wave height and increased skewness of the
nonlinear-wave elevation distribution, while a following shear ($U'(z)<0$) has
opposite effects. With the wave spectrum and velocity profile measured in the
Columbia River estuary by Zippel & Thomson [J. Geophys. Res: Oceans 122, 3311

is significantly reduced and enhanced during ebb and flood, respectively,
adding support to the notion that shear currents need to be accounted for in

cosmic rays (CRs) remains unclear, but jets launched by both supermassive black
holes in the centre of galaxies and stellar-mass black holes harboured in X-ray
binaries (BHXBs) are among the candidate sources for CR acceleration. When CRs
accelerate in astrophysical jets, they initiate particle cascades that form
{\gamma}-rays and neutrinos. In the so-called hadronic scenario, the population
of accelerated CRs requires a significant amount of energy to properly explain
the spectral constraints similarly to a purely leptonic scenario. The amount of
energy required often exceeds the Eddington limit, or even the total energy
available within the jets. The exact energy source for the accelerated protons
is unclear, but due to energy conservation along the jets, it is believed to
come from the jet itself via transfer of energy from the magnetic fields, or
kinetic energy from the outflow. To address this hadronic energy issue and to
self-consistently evolve the energy flux along the flows, we explore a novel
treatment for including hadronic content, in which instabilities along the
jet/wind border play a critical role. We discuss the impact of the different
jet composition on the jet dynamics for a pair dominated and an electron-proton

others, the effects of non-pharmacological and pharmacological measures,
changes in population behaviour and random events. In this work, we give
priority to data-driven approaches and choose to avoid a priori and ad-hoc
methods. We introduce a generalised family of epidemiologically informed
mechanistic models, guided by Ordinary Differential Equations and embedded in a
probabilistic model. The mechanistic models SIKR and SEMIKR with K Infectious
and M Exposed sub-compartments (resulting in non-exponential infectious and
exposed periods) are enriched with a time-dependent transmission rate,
parametrized using Bayesian P-splines. This enables an extensive flexibility in
the transmission dynamics, with no ad-hoc intervention, while maintaining good
differentiability properties. Our probabilistic model relies on the solutions
of the mechanistic model and benefits from access to the information about
under-reporting of new infected cases, a crucial property when studying
diseases with a large fraction of asymptomatic infections. Such a model can be
efficiently differentiated, which facilitates the use of Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo for sampling from the posterior distribution of the model parameters. The
features and advantages of the proposed approach are demonstrated through
comparison with state-of-the-art methods using a synthetic dataset.
Furthermore, we successfully apply our methodology to the study of the

Here, we use Brownian dynamics simulations to study a polymer model for
chromosomes accounting for multiple types ('colours') of chromatin-binding
proteins. Our multi-colour model shows the spontaneous emergence of both
segregated and mixed clusters of chromatin-bound proteins, depending mainly on
their size, thereby reconciling the previous experimental observations.
Additionally, remarkable small-world networks emerge; in these, positive and
negative correlations in activities of transcription units provide simple
explanations of why adjacent units in large domains are co-transcribed so
often, and how one eQTL (expression quantitative trait locus) can up-regulate
some genes and down-regulate others. We also explain how local genome edits
induce distant omnigenic and pangenomic effects, and develop ways to predict
activities of all transcription units on human chromosomes. All results point
to 1D location being a key determinant of transcription, consistently with the

analyze and identify the partner's potential policy primitives so that it can
take different actions accordingly. In this way, the ego agent is able to learn
more universal cooperative behaviors for collaborating with diverse partners.
We conduct experiments on the Overcooked environment, and evaluate the
zero-shot human-AI coordination performance of our method with both
behavior-cloned human proxies and real humans. The results demonstrate that our
method significantly increases the diversity of partners and enables ego agents
to learn more diverse behaviors than baselines, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance in all scenarios. We also open-source a human-AI coordination study

for software process management and improvement. However, its adoption in
industry is less than what the research community expected due to the burden of
measurement cost and the high demand for domain knowledge. The difficulty of
extracting appropriate metrics with real data from process enactment is one of
the great challenges. Objective: We aim to provide evidence-based support of
the process metrics for software process (simulation) modeling. Method: A
systematic literature review was performed by extending our previous review
series to draw a comprehensive understanding of the metrics for process
modeling following a meta-model of ontology of metrics in SPS. Results: We
identified 145 process modeling studies that collectively involve 2130 metrics
and classified them using the coding technique. Two diagrams which illustrate
the high frequency causal relationships used between metrics are proposed in
terms of two hierarchical levels of modeling purposes. We revisited the data
issues encountered in SPS data preparing phases, as well as identified the
corresponding strategies. Conclusion: The results of this study provide process
modelers with an evidence-based reference of the identification and the use of
metrics in SPS modeling, and further contribute to the development of the body
of knowledge on software metrics in the context of process modeling.
Furthermore, this study is not limited to process simulation but can be
extended to software process modeling, in general. Taking simulation metrics as
standards and references can further motivate and guide software developers to
improve the collection, governance, and application of process data in
practice.

visible in other views due to the large disparity. In this paper, we expand
LF-DeOcc in more challenging datasets, densely sampled (dense) LF images, which
are taken by a micro-lens-based portable LF camera. Due to the small disparity
ranges of dense LF images, most of the background regions are invisible in any

define the occlusion, and (3) inpaint occluded regions. By dividing the
framework into three specialized components according to the roles, the
development and analysis can be easier. Furthermore, an explainable
intermediate representation, an occlusion mask, can be obtained in the proposed

  Architecture Search","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2203.01665",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural Architecture Search has attracted increasing attention in recent
years. Among them, differential NAS approaches such as DARTS, have gained
popularity for the search efficiency. However, they still suffer from three
main issues, that are, the weak stability due to the performance collapse, the
poor generalization ability of the searched architectures, and the inferior
robustness to different kinds of proxies. To solve the stability and
generalization problems, a simple-but-effective regularization method, termed
as Beta-Decay, is proposed to regularize the DARTS-based NAS searching process
(i.e., $\beta$-DARTS). Specifically, Beta-Decay regularization can impose
constraints to keep the value and variance of activated architecture parameters
from being too large, thereby ensuring fair competition among architecture
parameters and making the supernet less sensitive to the impact of input on the
operation set. In-depth theoretical analyses on how it works and why it works
are provided. Comprehensive experiments validate that Beta-Decay regularization
can help to stabilize the searching process and makes the searched network more
transferable across different datasets. To address the robustness problem, we
first benchmark different NAS methods under a wide range of proxy data, proxy
channels, proxy layers and proxy epochs, since the robustness of NAS under
different kinds of proxies has not been explored before. We then conclude some
interesting findings and find that $\beta$-DARTS always achieves the best
result among all compared NAS methods under almost all proxies. We further
introduce the novel flooding regularization to the weight optimization of
$\beta$-DARTS (i.e., Bi-level regularization), and experimentally and
theoretically verify its effectiveness for improving the proxy robustness of
differentiable NAS.

flexible tools that can learn complex correlations between a large number of
features, but are traditionally designed as deterministic estimators. In this
work, we use the IllustrisTNG300-1 simulation and apply neural networks in a
binning classification scheme to predict probability distributions of central
galaxy properties, namely stellar mass, colour, specific star formation rate,
and radius, using as input features the halo mass, concentration, spin, age,
and the overdensity on a scale of 3 $h^{-1}$ Mpc. The model captures the
intrinsic scatter in the relation between halo and galaxy properties, and can
thus be used to quantify the uncertainties related to the stochasticity of the

proposed method, one can define and accurately reproduce the properties of the
different galaxy populations in great detail. We demonstrate the power of this
tool by directly comparing traditional single-point estimators and the

room-temperature magnetostriction in Mn$_3$Sn, a non-collinear antiferromanget
with Weyl nodes. Longitudinal magnetostriction is negative and isotropic
($\Lambda_{11}= \Lambda_{22} \approx - 1.5 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{-5}$ T$^{-1}$)
and slightly larger than a transverse magnetostriction of opposite sign
($\Lambda_{12}= \Lambda_{21} \approx + 1.1 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{-5}$ T$^{-1}$).
We argue that this is caused by the field-induced twist of spins. This
field-linear magnetostriction, which can be quantitatively accounted for by the
magnetic and elastic energy scales of the inter-twinned spin-lattice texture,
is three times larger than the recently measured piezomagnetic coefficient. We
find that the components of the piezomagnetic tensor, $\Lambda$, evolve with
variation in Mn excess. At the threshold magnetic field of domain nucleation

jump in longitudinal magnetostriction. In a narrow field window, where the

energy via spin-down processes to accelerate and heat the ejecta. The
progenitor(s) of these magnetar-driven SESNe, and the origin of considerable

fast-spinning magnetars upon core-collapse are still under debate. Popular
proposed scenarios in the literature cannot simultaneously explain their event
rate density, SN and magnetar parameters, and the observed metallicity. Here,
we perform a detailed binary evolution simulation that demonstrates that tidal
spin-up helium stars with efficient AM transport mechanism in close binaries
can form fast-spinning magnetars at the end of stars' life to naturally
reproduce the universal energy-mass correlation of these magnetar-driven SESNe.
Our models are consistent with the event rate densities, host environments,

core-collapse of ultra-stripped stars and be powered by a spinning-down neutron
star. Following this consideration, it is expected that the late-time evolution
of the progenitor stars can leave important imprints in the circumstellar
material (CSM) of the FBOTs, due to the strong mass loss of the stars. The
interaction of the FBOT ejecta with the CSM can drive a long-lasting shock to
generate radio emission, which thus enables us to probe the CSM properties
through radio observation although such observations are still rare. Within the
framework of the magnetar-powered model, Liu et al.(2022) fitted the multi-band
optical light curves of 40 FBOTs and, hence, the statistical distributions of
the FBOT magnetar and ejecta parameters were obtained. Based on these FBOT
population results, we investigate the dependence of the radio emission on the
mass-loss rate of the progenitors and evaluate the detectability of radio
emission from FBOTs with current and future telescopes. It is found that the
distribution of the peak time and peak luminosity of the emission at 8.4 GHz
are primarily in the regions of $t_{\rm{peak},\nu}=10^{2.12\pm0.63}$ days and
$L_{\rm{peak},\nu}=10^{28.73\pm0.83}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, respectively. A
joint detection of the Zwicky Transient Facility and Very Large Array could
achieve success in about 8.7% FBOTs of $z\leq1$. Furthermore, if considering a

Many flexible families of normalizing flows have been developed. However, the

To address this shortcoming, in this work we introduce a

estimation is performed using the expectation maximization algorithm and a

feasibility of detecting the relevant delta, theta, alpha, and beta band EEG
activity through the ear EEG is yet to be investigated. Through measurements of

However, the combined damaging effect of corrosion and fatigue is not well
understood due to the uncertainties associated with the stochastic nature of
pitting corrosion. A pitting corrosion defect could have a quite complex
morphology that varies randomly from one case to another. Nevertheless, in
numerical corrosion fatigue studies, the complex pit morphology is often
idealized using an overly simplified geometry with a smooth surface because of
the diffi-culties involved in modelling defects with the irregular and random
shapes of pitting corrosion. The present study investigates the influence of
such geometrical simplifications on the results of numerical corrosion fatigue
analyses. For this purpose, an isolated complex-shaped pit, generated using a
hierarchical stochastic algorithm scripted in Python and linked with
Abaqus/CAE, is developed in a Q235 steel dog-bone specimen. The numer-ical
results obtained from this model are compared with those from another model
containing an idealized counterpart of the irregular pit. A discussion on the
effect of pit morphology on the stress/strain history and distribution and
fatigue crack initiation is presented.

distribution over an airfoil under dynamic stall from images of the flowfield.
The network is capable of identifying relevant flow features present in the
images and associate them to the airfoil response. Results demonstrate that the
model is effective in interpolating and extrapolating between flow regimes and
for different airfoil motions, meaning that ViT-based models may offer a
promising alternative for sensors in experimental campaigns and for building
robust surrogate models of complex unsteady flows. In addition, we uniquely
treat the image semantic segmentation as an image-to-image translation task
that infers semantic labels of structures from the input images in a supervised
way. Given an input image of the velocity field, the resulting convolutional
neural network (CNN) generates synthetic images of any corresponding fluid
property of interest. In particular, we convert the velocity field data into

  Electric Vehicle Charging Demand",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Electric vehicle charging demand models, with charging records as input, will
inherently be biased toward the supply of available chargers. These models
often fail to account for demand lost from occupied charging stations and
competitors. The lost demand suggests that the actual demand is likely higher
than the charging records reflect, i.e., the true demand is latent
(unobserved), and the observations are censored. As a result, machine learning
models that rely on these observed records for forecasting charging demand may
be limited in their application in future infrastructure expansion and supply
management, as they do not estimate the true demand for charging. We propose
using censorship-aware models to model charging demand to address this
limitation. These models incorporate censorship in their loss functions and
learn the true latent demand distribution from observed charging records. We
study how occupied charging stations and competing services censor demand using
GPS trajectories from cars in Copenhagen, Denmark. We find that censorship
occurs up to $61\%$ of the time in some areas of the city. We use the observed
charging demand from our study to estimate the true demand and find that
censorship-aware models provide better prediction and uncertainty estimation of
actual demand than censorship-unaware models. We suggest that future charging
models based on charging records should account for censoring to expand the
application areas of machine learning models in supply management and
infrastructure expansion.

possibilities to investigate the nanoscale dynamics of individual biomolecules

precludes the simultaneous interrogation of different fluorescently labeled

simultaneously recorded fluorescence fluctuations of dual-color labeled
transmembrane receptors known to form nanoclusters in living cells.
Fluorescence cross-correlation studies revealed transient interactions between
individual receptors in regions of ~60 nm. Moreover, the high
signal-to-background ratio provided by the antenna illumination allowed us to
directly detect fluorescent bursts arising from the passage of individual
receptors underneath the antenna. Remarkably, by reducing the illumination
volume below the characteristic receptor nanocluster sizes, we resolved
molecular diffusion within nanoclusters and distinguished it from nanocluster

without being damaged, as their protective shell can safely house sensors such

feedback. These oscillations in a pendulum-actuated spherical robot are caused
by the coupling between the forward and steering motions due to nonholonomic
constraints. Designing a controller to limit wobbling in these robots is
challenging due to their underactuated nature. We propose a model-based
controller to navigate a pendulum-actuated spherical robot using wobble-free
turning maneuvers consisting of circular arcs and straight lines. The model is
developed using Lagrange-D'Alembert equations and accounts for the coupled
forward and steering motions. The model is further analyzed to derive
expressions for radius of curvature, precession rate, wobble amplitude, and
wobble frequency during circular motions. Finally, we design an input-output
feedback linearization-based controller to control the robot's heading

offer a wide range of potential applications in the areas of photo-thermal

This model is given by the heat equation where the body source term comes from
the modulus of the electric field generated by the used incident

vision tasks, obvious performance degradation still exists when models are
tested in out-of-distribution scenarios. In addressing this limitation, we
ponder that the feature statistics (mean and standard deviation), which carry
the domain characteristics of the training data, can be properly manipulated to
improve the generalization ability of deep learning models. Existing methods
commonly consider feature statistics as deterministic values measured from the
learned features and do not explicitly model the uncertain statistics
discrepancy caused by potential domain shifts during testing. In this paper, we
improve the network generalization ability by modeling domain shifts with
uncertainty (DSU), i.e., characterizing the feature statistics as uncertain
distributions during training. Specifically, we hypothesize that the feature
statistic, after considering the potential uncertainties, follows a
multivariate Gaussian distribution. During inference, we propose an
instance-wise adaptation strategy that can adaptively deal with the
unforeseeable shift and further enhance the generalization ability of the
trained model with negligible additional cost. We also conduct theoretical
analysis on the aspects of generalization error bound and the implicit
regularization effect, showing the efficacy of our method. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method consistently improves the network
generalization ability on multiple vision tasks, including image
classification, semantic segmentation, instance retrieval, and pose estimation.
Our methods are simple yet effective and can be readily integrated into

Comparison between theory and experiment thus enables us to infer asymptotic

cross section are completely insensitive to the choice of the regulator.
Accordingly, this reaction can be used to constrain the one-neutron separation

been marketed. However, the existing models suffer from the following
limitations. Firstly, in the real world, only a minority of diseases have
definite treatment drugs. This leads to an imbalance in the proportion of
validated drug-disease associations (positive samples) and unvalidated
drug-disease associations (negative samples), which disrupts the optimization
gradient of the model. Secondly, the existing drug representation does not take
into account the behavioral information of the drug, resulting in its inability
to comprehensively model the latent feature of the drug. In this work, we
propose a balanced matrix factorization with embedded behavior information
(BMF) for computational drug repositioning to address the above-mentioned
shortcomings. Specifically, in the BMF model, we propose a novel balanced
contrastive loss (BCL) to optimize the category imbalance problem in
computational drug repositioning. The BCL optimizes the parameters in the model
by maximizing the similarity between the target drug and positive disease, and
minimizing the similarity between the target drug and negative disease below
the margin. In addition, we designed a method to enhance drug representation
using its behavioral information. The comprehensive experiments on three
computational drug repositioning datasets validate the effectiveness of the
above improvement points. And the superiority of BMF model is demonstrated by
experimental comparison with seven benchmark models.

both phenomena were believed as exclusive hallmarks of Majorana bound state.
Within a unified theoretical framework, we show that zero-energy Andreev bound
states can also generate both a nearly quantized conductance plateau, and an
integer Fano factor, in a sizable, continuous, yet topologically trivial
parameter space. Importantly, we further propose to obtain strong Majorana
evidence by a combined measurement of tunneling conductance and current noise.
Specifically, for a Majorana bound state and zero-energy Andreev bound state, a
nearly quantized zero-bias conductance peak always accompanies a zero-bias dip

discovery in healthcare-related research fields. However, these methods can
only be reliably used if they can be trained on high-quality and curated

falciparum protein antigen candidates exists. The parasite Plasmodium
falciparum causes the infectious disease malaria. Thus, identifying potential
antigens is of utmost importance for the development of antimalarial drugs and
vaccines. Since exploring antigen candidates experimentally is an expensive and
time-consuming process, applying machine learning methods to support this
process has the potential to accelerate the development of drugs and vaccines,
which are needed for fighting and controlling malaria. Results: We developed
PlasmoFAB, a curated benchmark that can be used to train machine learning
methods for the exploration of Plasmodium falciparum protein antigen
candidates. We combined an extensive literature search with domain expertise to
create high-quality labels for Plasmodium falciparum specific proteins that
distinguish between antigen candidates and intracellular proteins.
Additionally, we used our benchmark to compare different well-known prediction
models and available protein localization prediction services on the task of
identifying protein antigen candidates. We show that available general-purpose
services are unable to provide sufficient performance on identifying protein
antigen candidates and are outperformed by our models that were trained on this
tailored data. Availability: PlasmoFAB is publicly available on Zenodo with DOI

$\Delta$ denotes the maximum degree, it suffices if each node limits its color
choice to $O(\log n)$ independently sampled colors in $\{1, 2, \dots,
\Delta+1\}$. They showed that it is possible to color the resulting sparsified

common color, which are only $\tilde{O}(n)$ edges -- and obtain a $\Delta+1$
coloring for the original graph. However, to compute the actual coloring, that
information must be gathered at a single location for centralized processing.
We seek instead a local algorithm to compute such a coloring in the sparsified
graph. The question is if this can be achieved in $\operatorname{poly}(\log n)$
distributed rounds with small messages.
  Our main result is an algorithm that computes a $\Delta+1$-coloring after
palette sparsification with $O(\log^2 n)$ random colors per node and runs in
$O(\log^2 \Delta + \log^3 \log n)$ rounds on the sparsified graph, using

elastic, body, active, and hydrodynamic moments, all in three-dimensions. Here,
we present a generalised 3D coarse-graining formulation that is efficient,
simple-to-implement, readily extendable and usable for a wide array of
applications. Our method allows for simulation of collections of 3D elastic
filaments, capable of full flexural and torsional deformations, coupled
non-locally via hydrodynamic interactions, and including multi-body
microhydrodynamics of structures with arbitrary geometry. The method exploits
the exponential mapping of quaternions for tracking three-dimensional rotations
of each interacting element in the system, allowing for computation times up to
150 times faster than a direct quaternion implementation. Spheres are used as a
`building block' of both filaments and solid micro-structures for
straightforward and intuitive construction of arbitrary three-dimensional
geometries present in the environment. We highlight the strengths of the method
in a series of non-trivial applications including bi-flagellated swimming,
sperm-egg scattering, and particle transport by cilia arrays. Applications to
lab-on-a-chip devices, multi-filaments, mono-to-multi flagellated

challenging problem for incentive-providing institutions. In particular, since
the implementation of incentive is costly, to explore the optimal incentive
protocol, which ensures the desired collective goal at a minimal cost, is
worthy of study. In this work, we consider the positive and negative incentives
respectively for a structured population of individuals whose conflicting
interactions are characterized by a prisoner's dilemma game. We establish an
index function for quantifying the cumulative cost during the process of
incentive implementation, and theoretically derive the optimal positive and
negative incentive protocols for cooperation on regular networks. We find that
both types of optimal incentive protocols are identical and time-invariant.
Moreover, we compare the optimal rewarding and punishing schemes concerning
implementation cost and provide a rigorous basis for the usage of incentives in
the game-theoretical framework. We further perform computer simulations to
support our theoretical results and explore their robustness for different

This paper presents ASR experiments with read and conversational Austrian

FMR-ISHE results demonstrate that the [111] oriented Bi-YIG/Pt sample shows

Simulations of causal sets approximated by a region of 2d Minkowski spacetime
show that ladder molecules are fairly dense in the causal set, and provide a
light-cone like grid. Moreover, similar to the uniqueness of null geodesics

determine which cyclic quotient singularity is a maximal centre. If a cyclic

dynamics of cooperation among interacting agents in structured populations.
Many previous related works only consider one \emph{fixed} rule, while in
reality, individuals may switch, sometimes periodically, between rules. It is
of particular theoretical interest to investigate under what conditions the
periodic switching of strategy update rules facilitates the emergence of
cooperation. To answer this question, we study the evolutionary prisoner's
dilemma game on structured networks where agents can periodically switch their
strategy update rules. We accordingly develop a theoretical framework of this
periodically switched system, where the replicator equation corresponding to
each specific microscopic update rule is used for describing the subsystem, and
all the subsystems are activated in sequence. By utilizing switched system
theory, we identify the theoretical condition for the emergence of cooperative
behavior. Under this condition, we have proved that the periodically switched
system with different switching rules can converge to the full cooperation
state. Finally, we consider an example where two strategy update rules, that
is, the imitation and pairwise-comparison updating, are periodically switched,
and find that our numerical calculations validate our theoretical results.

While Autoencoder-based approaches have been widely used for this purpose,
sampling from their latent spaces can be challenging. Mixture models are
currently the most efficient way to sample from these spaces. In this work, we
propose a new approach that models the latent space of an Autoencoder as a
simplex, allowing for a novel heuristic for determining the number of
components in the mixture model. This heuristic is independent of the number of
classes and produces comparable results. We also introduce a sampling method
based on probability mass functions, taking advantage of the compactness of the
latent space. We evaluate our approaches on a synthetic dataset and demonstrate
their performance on three benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Celeba. Our
approach achieves an image generation FID of 4.29, 13.55, and 11.90 on the
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Celeba datasets, respectively. The best AE FID results to
date on those datasets are respectively 6.3, 85.3 and 35.6 we hence
substantially improve those figures (the lower is the FID the better). However,
AEs are not the best performing algorithms on the concerned datasets and all
FID records are currently held by GANs. While we do not perform better than
GANs on CIFAR and Celeba we do manage to squeeze-out a non-negligible
improvement (of 0.21) over the current GAN-held record for the MNIST dataset.

demonstrate through experiments on popular mathematical benchmarks, that neural

the behavior of particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm methods and
analyze their stability when coupled with NN-proxies. The correctness of the

categorized into one of two classes, `partners' and `rivals.' More recently,
another class, `friendly rivals,' has been identified in longer-memory strategy
spaces. Friendly rivals qualify as both partners and rivals: They fully
cooperate with themselves, like partners, but never allow their co-players to
earn higher payoffs, like rivals. Although they have appealing theoretical
properties, it is unclear whether they would emerge in evolving population
because most previous works focus on memory-one strategy space, where no
friendly rival strategy exists. To investigate this issue, we have conducted
large-scale evolutionary simulations in well-mixed and group-structured
populations and compared the evolutionary dynamics between memory-one and
memory-three strategy spaces. In a well-mixed population, the memory length
does not make a major difference, and the key factors are the population size
and the benefit of cooperation. Friendly rivals play a minor role because being
a partner or a rival is often good enough in a given environment. It is in a
group-structured population that memory length makes a stark difference: When
memory-three strategies are available, friendly rivals become dominant, and the
cooperation level nearly reaches a maximum, even when the benefit of
cooperation is so low that cooperation would not be achieved in a well-mixed
population. This result highlights the important interaction between group
structure and memory lengths that drive the evolution of cooperation.

Existing solutions are used to combine distributed recommendation algorithms

heavyweight models at the server and hinders the deployment of on-device
intelligent models to end-users. This paper proposes a novel Personalized
Federated Recommendation (PFedRec) framework to learn many user-specific
lightweight models to be deployed on smart devices rather than a heavyweight
model on a server. Moreover, we propose a new dual personalization mechanism to
effectively learn fine-grained personalization on both users and items. The
overall learning process is formulated into a unified federated optimization
framework. Specifically, unlike previous methods that share exactly the same
item embeddings across users in a federated system, dual personalization allows
mild finetuning of item embeddings for each user to generate user-specific
views for item representations which can be integrated into existing federated
recommendation methods to gain improvements immediately. Experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of PFedRec and
the dual personalization mechanism. Moreover, we provide visualizations and
in-depth analysis of the personalization techniques in item embedding, which
shed novel insights on the design of recommender systems in federated settings.

  More Effectively","To be published in the proceedings of 45th International Conference

  (ICSE-SEET '23), May 14-20, 2023, Melbourne, Australia",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Science communication forms the bridge between computer science researchers
and their target audience. Researchers who can effectively draw attention to
their research findings and communicate them comprehensibly not only help their
target audience to actually learn something, but also benefit themselves from
the increased visibility of their work and person. However, the necessary
skills for good science communication must also be taught, and this has so far
been neglected in the field of software engineering education.
  We therefore designed and implemented a science communication seminar for
bachelor students of computer science curricula. Students take the position of
a researcher who, shortly after publication, is faced with having to draw
attention to the paper and effectively communicate the contents of the paper to
one or more target audiences. Based on this scenario, each student develops a
communication strategy for an already published software engineering research
paper and tests the resulting ideas with the other seminar participants.
  We explain our design decisions for the seminar, and combine our experiences
with responses to a participant survey into lessons learned. With this
experience report, we intend to motivate and enable other lecturers to offer a
similar seminar at their university. Collectively, university lecturers can
prepare the next generation of computer science researchers to not only be
experts in their field, but also to communicate research findings more
effectively.

Petrovi\'c, Vincenzo Perri","Bayesian Detection of Mesoscale Structures in Pathway Data on Graphs","21 pages, 3 figures",,,,"stat.ME cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mesoscale structures are an integral part of the abstraction and analysis of
complex systems. They reveal a node's function in the network, and facilitate
our understanding of the network dynamics. For example, they can represent
communities in social or citation networks, roles in corporate interactions, or
core-periphery structures in transportation networks. We usually detect
mesoscale structures under the assumption of independence of interactions.
Still, in many cases, the interactions invalidate this assumption by occurring
in a specific order. Such patterns emerge in pathway data; to capture them, we
have to model the dependencies between interactions using higher-order network
models. However, the detection of mesoscale structures in higher-order networks
is still under-researched. In this work, we derive a Bayesian approach that
simultaneously models the optimal partitioning of nodes in groups and the
optimal higher-order network dynamics between the groups. In synthetic data we
demonstrate that our method can recover both standard proximity-based
communities and role-based groupings of nodes. In synthetic and real world data
we show that it can compete with baseline techniques, while additionally
providing interpretable abstractions of network dynamics.

  nontrivial band topology",,,,,"cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the past fifteen years, tremendous efforts have been devoted to
realizing topological superconductivity in realistic materials and systems,
predominately propelled by their promising application potentials in
fault-tolerant quantum information processing. In this article, we attempt to
give an overview on some of the main developments in this field, focusing in
particular on two-dimensional crystalline superconductors that possess either
intrinsic p-wave pairing or nontrivial band topology. We first classify the
three different conceptual schemes to achieve topological superconductor (TSC),
enabled by real-space superconducting proximity effect, reciprocal-space
superconducting proximity effect, and intrinsic TSC. Whereas the first scheme
has so far been most extensively explored, the subtle difference between the
other two remains to be fully substantiated. We then move on to candidate
intrinsic or p-wave superconductors, including Sr2RuO4, UTe2, Pb3Bi, and
graphene-based systems. For TSC systems that rely on proximity effects, the
emphases are mainly on the coexistence of superconductivity and nontrivial band
topology, as exemplified by transition metal dichalcogenides, cobalt pnictides,
and stanene, all in monolayer or few-layer regime. The review completes with
discussions on the three dominant tuning schemes of strain, gating, and
ferroelectricity in acquiring one or both essential ingredients of the TSC, and
optimizations of such tuning capabilities may prove to be decisive in our drive
towards braiding of Majorana zero modes and demonstration of topological
qubits.

system as it determines the overall performance of the desalination plant. The
fraction of clean water that can be recovered via this process is often limited
by salt precipitation which plays a critical role in its sustainability. In
this work, we present a model to study the complex interplay between flow,
transport and precipitation processes in reverse osmosis membranes, which
together influence recovery and in turn process sustainability. A reactive
porous interface model describes the membrane with a dynamic evolving porosity
and permeability to capture the scaling and clogging of the membrane. An
open-source finite-volume numerical solver is implemented within the OpenFOAM
library and numerical tests are presented here showing the effect of the
various parameters of the model and the robustness of the model to describe a
wide range of operating conditions.

time warps, have been proposed as graded modalities that can be used to
quantify the growth of information in the course of program execution. The set
of time warps forms a simple distributive involutive residuated lattice --
called the time warp algebra -- that is equipped with residual operations
relevant to potential applications. In this paper, we show that although the
time warp algebra generates a variety that lacks the finite model property, it
nevertheless has a decidable equational theory. We also describe an
implementation of a procedure for deciding equations in this algebra, written
in the OCaml programming language, that makes use of the Z3 theorem prover.

  detecting vulnerable road users using transfer learning","9 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Cycling is an increasingly popular method of transportation for
sustainability and health benefits. However, cyclists face growing risks,
especially when encountering semi-trailer trucks. This study aims to reduce the
number of truck-cyclist collisions, which are often caused by semi-trailer
trucks making right-hook turns and poor driver attention to blind spots. To
achieve this, we designed a visual-based blind spot warning system that can
detect cyclists for semi-trailer truck drivers using deep learning. First,
several greater than 90% mAP cyclist detection models, such as the EfficientDet
Lite 1 and SSD MobileNetV2, were created using state-of-the-art lightweight
deep learning architectures fine-tuned on a newly proposed cyclist image
dataset composed of a diverse set of over 20,000 images. Next, the object
detection model was deployed onto a Google Coral Dev Board mini-computer with a
camera module and analyzed for speed, reaching inference times as low as 15
milliseconds. Lastly, the end-to-end blind spot cyclist detection device was
tested in real-time to model traffic scenarios and analyzed further for
performance and feasibility. We concluded that this portable blind spot alert
device can accurately and quickly detect cyclists and have the potential to
significantly improve cyclist safety. Future studies could determine the
feasibility of the proposed device in the trucking industry and improvements to
cyclist safety over time.

challenges to their training, inducing the imbalance between task fitting and
representation inference. To avert this, the existing strategies for VAEs focus
on adjusting the tradeoff by introducing hyperparameters, deriving a tighter
bound under some mild assumptions, or decomposing the loss components per
certain neural settings. VAEs still suffer from uncertain tradeoff learning.We
propose a novel evolutionary variational autoencoder (eVAE) building on the
variational information bottleneck (VIB) theory and integrative evolutionary
neural learning. eVAE integrates a variational genetic algorithm into VAE with
variational evolutionary operators including variational mutation, crossover,
and evolution. Its inner-outer-joint training mechanism synergistically and
dynamically generates and updates the uncertain tradeoff learning in the
evidence lower bound (ELBO) without additional constraints. Apart from learning
a lossy compression and representation of data under the VIB assumption, eVAE
presents an evolutionary paradigm to tune critical factors of VAEs and deep
neural networks and addresses the premature convergence and random search
problem by integrating evolutionary optimization into deep learning.
Experiments show that eVAE addresses the KL-vanishing problem for text
generation with low reconstruction loss, generates all disentangled factors
with sharp images, and improves the image generation quality,respectively. eVAE
achieves better reconstruction loss, disentanglement, and generation-inference
balance than its competitors.

poisoning, causing machine learning models learned on these images to be
injected with backdoors. Most previous attacks assumed that the wild images are
labeled. In reality, however, most images on the web are unlabeled.
Specifically, we study the effects of unlabeled backdoor images under
semi-supervised learning (SSL) on widely studied deep neural networks. To be
realistic, we assume that the adversary is zero-knowledge and that the
semi-supervised learning model is trained from scratch. Firstly, we find the
fact that backdoor poisoning always fails when poisoned unlabeled images come
from different classes, which is different from poisoning the labeled images.
The reason is that the SSL algorithms always strive to correct them during
training. Therefore, for unlabeled images, we implement backdoor poisoning on
images from the target class. Then, we propose a gradient matching strategy to
craft poisoned images such that their gradients match the gradients of target
images on the SSL model, which can fit poisoned images to the target class and
realize backdoor injection. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first
approach to backdoor poisoning on unlabeled images of trained-from-scratch SSL
models. Experiments show that our poisoning achieves state-of-the-art attack
success rates on most SSL algorithms while bypassing modern backdoor defenses.

that the last-layer features collapse to their class-means, and those
class-means are the vertices of a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF). This
phenomenon is known as Neural Collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$). Recent papers have
theoretically shown that $\mathcal{NC}$ emerges in the global minimizers of

deep linear networks for the popular mean squared error (MSE) and cross entropy

blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals as node inputs, the proposed
GraphCorr method leverages a node embedder module based on a transformer
encoder to capture temporally-windowed latent representations of BOLD signals.
GraphCorr also leverages a lag filter module to account for delayed
interactions across nodes by computing cross-correlation of windowed BOLD
signals across a range of time lags. Information captured by the two modules is
fused via a message passing algorithm executed on the graph, and enhanced node
features are then computed at the output. These enhanced features are used to
drive a subsequent learning-based model to analyze fMRI time series with
elevated sensitivity. Comprehensive demonstrations on two public datasets
indicate improved classification performance and interpretability for several
state-of-the-art graphical and convolutional methods that employ
GraphCorr-derived feature representations of fMRI time series as their input.

properties of tissue, which fundamentally limits the contrast, particularly in
soft tissues like the breast. Imaging based on refraction can overcome this
limitation, but so far has been constrained to high-dose ex-vivo applications
or required highly coherent X-ray sources, like synchrotrons. It has been
predicted that grating interferometry (GI) could eventually allow computed
tomography (CT) to be more dose-efficient. However, the benefit of refraction
in clinical CT has not been demonstrated so far. Here we show that GI-CT is
more dose-efficient in imaging of breast tissue than conventional CT. Our
system, based on a 70kVp X-ray tube source and commercially available gratings,
demonstrated superior quality, in terms of adipose-to-glandular tissue
contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), of refraction-contrast compared to the
attenuation images. The fusion of the two modes of contrast outperformed
conventional CT for spatial resolutions better than 263{\mu}m and an average
dose to the breast of 16mGy, which is in the clinical breast CT range. Our
results show that grating interferometry can significantly reduce the dose,
while maintaining the image quality, in diagnostic breast CT. Unlike
conventional absorption-based CT, the sensitivity of refraction-based imaging
is far from being fully exploited, and further progress will lead to
significant improvements of clinical X-ray CT.

of them is its characteristic lengths: what sets the size of these filaments,
and how does this impact resistive switching properties. Here we use a
combination of wide-field and scattering-type scanning near-field optical
microscopies to characterize filament formation in NdNiO3 and SmNiO3 thin

  Cybersecurity",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised learning-based anomaly detection in latent space has gained
importance since discriminating anomalies from normal data becomes difficult in
high-dimensional space. Both density estimation and distance-based methods to
detect anomalies in latent space have been explored in the past. These methods
prove that retaining valuable properties of input data in latent space helps in
the better reconstruction of test data. Moreover, real-world sensor data is
skewed and non-Gaussian in nature, making mean-based estimators unreliable for
skewed data. Again, anomaly detection methods based on reconstruction error
rely on Euclidean distance, which does not consider useful correlation
information in the feature space and also fails to accurately reconstruct the
data when it deviates from the training distribution. In this work, we address
the limitations of reconstruction error-based autoencoders and propose a
kernelized autoencoder that leverages a robust form of Mahalanobis distance
(MD) to measure latent dimension correlation to effectively detect both near
and far anomalies. This hybrid loss is aided by the principle of maximizing the
mutual information gain between the latent dimension and the high-dimensional
prior data space by maximizing the entropy of the latent space while preserving
useful correlation information of the original data in the low-dimensional
latent space. The multi-objective function has two goals -- it measures
correlation information in the latent feature space in the form of robust MD
distance and simultaneously tries to preserve useful correlation information
from the original data space in the latent space by maximizing mutual
information between the prior and latent space.

its boundary is foliated by closed caustics: curves whose tangent lines are
reflected to their tangent lines. The famous Birkhoff Conjecture (studied by
many mathematicians including H.Poritsky, M.Bialy, S.Bolotin, A.Mironov,
V.Kaloshin, A.Sorrentino) states that the only integrable billiards are
ellipses. Integrability is equivalent to existence of a first integral of the
billiard flow independent (on appropriate subset) with its trivial integral:
the squared velocity. Bolotin's Conjecture, now a joint theorem of Bialy,
Mironov and the author, deals with billiards whose flow admits a non-trivial
integral polynomial in the velocity. It states that 1) if the boundary of such
a billiard is $C^2$, nonlinear, connected, then it is a conic; 2) if it is
piecewise $C^2$-smooth and contains a nonlinear arc, then it consists of arcs
of conics from a confocal pencil and segments of ""admissible lines"" for the
pencil. The minimal degree of integral is always either 2, or 4. In the present
paper we extend the above results to projective billiards introduced by Sergei
Tabachnikov: planar curves equipped with a transversal line field, which
defines a reflection acting on oriented lines and the projective billiard flow.
We classify those piecewise $C^4$-smooth projective billiards containing a
nonlinear arc whose flow admits a non-constant first integral that is a
rational $0$-homogeneous function of the velocity. (Case of $C^4$-smooth
connected projective billiard was treated in a previous author's paper. It was
shown there that the minimal degree of integral can be arbitrary even number.)
Unexpectedly, we show that such a piecewise $C^4$-smooth projective billiard
associated to a dual pencil of conics may have integral of minimal degree 2, 4,
or 12. To do this, we prove dual results, for the so-called dual
multibilliards.

phenomena governed by collective modes spanning wide spatial and temporal
domains. In order to successfully tackle such problems mesoscopic
coarse-grained (CG) statistical models are being developed, providing a
dramatic reduction in computational complexity. CG models provide an
intermediate step in the complex statistical framework of linking the
thermodynamics of condensed phases with the properties of their constituent
atoms and molecules. These allow us to offload part of the problem to the CG
model itself and reformulate the remainder in terms of reduced CG phase space.
However, such exchange of pawns to chess pieces, or ``Hamiltonian
renormalization'', is a radical step and the thermodynamics of the primary
atomic and CG models could be markedly different. Here, we present a
comprehensive study of the phase diagram including binodal and interfacial
properties of a novel soft CG model, which includes finite-range attraction and
supports liquid phases. Although the model is rooted in similar arguments to
the Lennard-Jones (LJ) atomic pair potential, its phase behaviour is
qualitatively different from that of LJ and features several anomalies such as
an unusually broad liquid range, change in concavity of the liquid coexistence
branch with variation of the model parameters, volume contraction on fusion,
temperature of maximum density in the liquid phase and negative thermal
expansion in the solid phase. These results provide new insight into the

equations are coupled by zero or first order coupling terms, with constant
coupling matrices, without any structure assumptions on them. The distributed
control acts through a constant matrix operator on the system, so that there
might be notably less controls than equations, encompassing the case of
indirect and simultaneous controllability. More precisely, we prove that in
small time, such kind of systems are never controllable in appropriate Sobolev
spaces, whereas in large time, null-controllability holds, for sufficiently
regular initial data, if and and only if a spectral Kalman rank condition is
verified. We also prove that initial data that are not regular enough are not
controllable. Positive results are obtained by using the so-called fictitious
control method together with an algebraic solvability argument, whereas the
negative results are obtained by using an appropriate WKB construction of
approximate solutions for the adjoint system associated to the control problem.

applied to the approximation problem for holomorphic mappings.

Coulomb interaction is strongly screened. We investigate the low-density regime
of the homogeneous electron gas, where low-energy collective excitations and
ghost modes were anticipated. Using the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE), we show
that both phenomena exist thanks to reduced screening at short distances. This
is not captured by common approximations used in ab initio BSE calculations,
but requires vertex corrections that take the fermionic nature of charges into
account. The electron-hole wavefunction of the low-energy modes shows strong
and very anisotropic electron-hole correlation, which speaks for an excitonic

these phenomena explains why, on the other hand, also the simple adiabatic
local density approximation to time-dependent density functional theory can
capture these effects.

a key role in the processes of modeling and representing species evolution.
Genome evolution of a given group of species is usually modeled by a species
phylogenetic tree that represents the main patterns of vertical descent.
However, the evolution of each gene is unique. It can be represented by its own
gene tree which can differ substantially from a general species tree
representation. Consensus trees and supertrees have been widely used in
evolutionary studies to combine phylogenetic information contained in
individual gene trees. Nevertheless, if the available gene trees are quite
different from each other, then the resulting consensus tree or supertree can
either include many unresolved subtrees corresponding to internal nodes of high
degree or can simply be a star tree. This may happen if the available gene
trees have been affected by different reticulate evolutionary events, such as
horizontal gene transfer, hybridization or genetic recombination. Thus, the
problem of inferring multiple alternative consensus trees or supertrees, using
clustering, becomes relevant since it allows one to regroup in different
clusters gene trees having similar evolutionary patterns (e.g. gene trees
representing genes that have undergone the same horizontal gene transfer or
recombination events). We critically review recent advances and methods in the
field of phylogenetic tree clustering, discuss the methods' mathematical
properties, and describe the main advantages and limitations of multiple
consensus tree and supertree approaches. In the application section, we show
how the multiple supertree clustering approach can be used to cluster aaRS gene

detrimental to the latency constraints of the applications, thus, fog computing
is often deployed. Executing these applications across heterogeneous fog
systems demonstrates stochastic execution time behavior that affects the task
completion time. We investigate and model various Industry 4.0 ML-based
applications' stochastic executions and analyze them. Industries like oil and
gas are prone to disasters requiring coordination of various latency-sensitive
activities. Hence, fog computing resources can get oversubscribed due to the
surge in the computing demands during a disaster. We propose federating nearby
fog computing systems and forming a fog federation to make remote Industry 4.0
sites resilient against the surge in computing demands. We propose a
statistical resource allocation method across fog federation for
latency-sensitive tasks. Many of the modern Industry 4.0 applications operate
based on a workflow of micro-services that are used alone within an industrial

a probability-based resource allocation method that can partition micro-service
workflows across fog federation to meet their latency constraints. Another
concern in Industry 4.0 is the data privacy of the federated fog. As such, we

expressions to redefine the ITR. We use graph theory to characterize the
relationship between the asymmetry of the transition statistics and the ITR
gain with the new definition, leading to potential bounds on data rate

target identification methods. Results indicate that the induced DM channel
asymmetry has a greater impact on the actual perceived ITR than the change in
input distribution. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the ITR gain under the
new definition is inversely correlated with the asymmetry in the channel
transition statistics. Individual input customizations are further shown to
yield perceived ITR performance improvements. An algorithm is proposed to find

extend such results to ensemble techniques.We anticipate that the results of

same universal class set. In this paper, we focus on a more general yet
practical setting, non-identical client class sets, where clients focus on
their own (different or even non-overlapping) class sets and seek a global
model that works for the union of these classes. If one views classification as
finding the best match between representations produced by data/label encoder,
such heterogeneity in client class sets poses a new significant challenge --
local encoders at different clients may operate in different and even
independent latent spaces, making it hard to aggregate at the server. We
propose a novel framework, FedAlign, to align the latent spaces across clients
from both label and data perspectives. From a label perspective, we leverage
the expressive natural language class names as a common ground for label
encoders to anchor class representations and guide the data encoder learning
across clients. From a data perspective, during local training, we regard the
global class representations as anchors and leverage the data points that are
close/far enough to the anchors of locally-unaware classes to align the data
encoders across clients. Our theoretical analysis of the generalization
performance and extensive experiments on four real-world datasets of different

probes to constrain cosmological parameters, specifically, to determine the
value of the Hubble constant $H_0$ through independent techniques. The two
standard methods to measure/infer $H_0$ rely on: (i) anchored observables for
the distance ladder, and (ii) establishing the relationship of the $H_0$ to the
angular size of the sound horizon in the recombination era assuming a standard
Cosmological Constant Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology. However, the
former requires a calibration with observables at nearby distances, while the
latter is not a direct measurement and is model-dependent. The physics behind
these aspects restrains our possibilities in selecting a calibration method
that can help minimise the systematic effects or in considering a fixed
cosmological model background. Anticipating the possibility of deeply exploring
the physics of new nearby observables such as the recently detected black hole
shadows, in this paper we propose standard rules to extend the studies related
to these observables. Supermassive black hole shadows can be characterised by
two parameters: the angular size of the shadow and the black hole mass. We
found that it is possible to break the degeneracy between these parameters by
forecasting and fixing certain conditions at high(er) redshifts, i.e., instead
of considering the $\approx$10\% precision from the EHT array, our results
reach a $\approx 4\%$, a precision that could be achievable in experiments in

atmospheric conditions, and the shape and magnitude of the forcing. Much of
this past work focuses on studying a simulation's response to external

possible nonlinear responses of the jet to tropospheric thermal forcing that
more closely resemble anthropogenic climate change. Our approach leverages the
idea behind the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, which relates the internal
variability of a system to its forced response but so far has been only used to
quantify linear responses. We train a CNN on data from a long control run of
the CESM dry dynamical core and show that it is able to skillfully predict the
nonlinear response of the jet to sustained external forcing. The trained CNN
provides a quick method for exploring the jet stream sensitivity to a wide
range of tropospheric temperature tendencies and, considering that this method
can likely be applied to any model with a long control run, could lend itself
useful for early stage experiment design.

how the history of decisions affects the current outcome by allowing the online

Particularly, we introduce the first projection-free meta-base learning

suboptimality against any sequence of time-varying decisions. We are motivated
by artificial intelligence applications where autonomous agents need to adapt
to time-varying environments in real-time, accounting for how past decisions
affect the present. Examples of such applications are: online control of
dynamical systems; statistical arbitrage; and time series prediction. The
algorithm builds on the Online Frank-Wolfe (OFW) and Hedge algorithms. We
demonstrate how our algorithm can be applied to the online control of linear
time-varying systems in the presence of unpredictable process noise. To this

optimal time-varying linear feedback control policy. We validate our algorithm

the Lagrange multipliers are trivial and have no jump across the matter
interfaces in both the physical and fiducial sectors, the junction conditions

find interesting classes of exact solutions that represent gravitational
collapse in MTBG. In the spatially flat case, under a certain tuning of the

we present optical linear and circular polarization measurements, observed with
VLT/FORS2 in the $R$-band (which corresponds to the blue/UV part of the
spectrum in rest frame), $\sim$ 7.2 and $\sim$ 12.2 rest-frame days after the
first detection, respectively, when the light curve of the transient had
settled in a bright blue plateau. Both linear and circular polarization are
consistent with zero, $p_{lin}$ = 0.14 $\pm$ 0.73 % and $p_{cir}$ = $-$0.30

The non detection of the linear and circular polarization is consistent with
the scenario of AT 2022cmc being a TDE where the thermal component
(disk+outflows) is viewed pole-on, assuming an axially symmetric geometry. The
presence and effect of a jet and/or external shocks are, however, difficult to

framework. We focus on prolongedness and define PAE-POMDP (Prolonged Action
Effect-Partially Observable Markov Decision Process), a subclass of POMDPs in
which the Markov assumption does not hold specifically due to prolonged effects
of actions. Motivated by the pharmacology literature, we propose a simple and
effective approach to converting drug dosing PAE-POMDPs into MDPs, enabling the
use of the existing RL algorithms to solve such problems. We validate the
proposed approach on a toy task, and a challenging glucose control task, for
which we devise a clinically-inspired reward function. Our results demonstrate
that: (1) the proposed method to restore the Markov assumption leads to
significant improvements over a vanilla baseline; (2) the approach is
competitive with recurrent policies which may inherently capture the prolonged
effect of actions; (3) it is remarkably more time and memory efficient than the
recurrent baseline and hence more suitable for real-time dosing control
systems; and (4) it exhibits favorable qualitative behavior in our policy
analysis.

  Sentence Grounding","Accepted by EMNLP Findings, 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) aims to identify the temporal boundary of a
specific segment from an untrimmed video by a sentence query. All existing
works first utilize a sparse sampling strategy to extract a fixed number of
video frames and then conduct multi-modal interactions with query sentence for
reasoning. However, we argue that these methods have overlooked two
indispensable issues: 1) Boundary-bias: The annotated target segment generally
refers to two specific frames as corresponding start and end timestamps. The
video downsampling process may lose these two frames and take the adjacent
irrelevant frames as new boundaries. 2) Reasoning-bias: Such incorrect new
boundary frames also lead to the reasoning bias during frame-query interaction,
reducing the generalization ability of model. To alleviate above limitations,
in this paper, we propose a novel Siamese Sampling and Reasoning Network (SSRN)
for TSG, which introduces a siamese sampling mechanism to generate additional
contextual frames to enrich and refine the new boundaries. Specifically, a
reasoning strategy is developed to learn the inter-relationship among these
frames and generate soft labels on boundaries for more accurate frame-query
reasoning. Such mechanism is also able to supplement the absent consecutive
visual semantics to the sampled sparse frames for fine-grained activity
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SSRN on
three challenging datasets.

strategy relies on that interfacing the thin films with appropriate
ferroelectric materials can switch on/off an interlayer hopping channel between
Mn-$e_g$ orbitals as the polarizations reversed, thus resulting in a switchable
interlayer antiferromagnetism-to-ferromagnetism transition. On the other hand,
the interface effect leads to asymmetric energy barrier heights for the two
polarization states. These properties allow us to build ferroelectrically
switchable triple and quadruple magnetic states with multiple Chern numbers in
thin films. Our study reveals that ferroelectrically switchable magnetic and
topological multistates in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ family can be obtained by rational
design for multifunctional electronic devices, which can also be applied to
other two-dimensional magnetic materials.

Therefore, we propose a deep learning (DL) modified AMP network (DL-mAMPnet)

relation between its displacement and time under a constant driving force. In
this study, we investigated the migration behaviors of a set of GBs in Ni by
applying the synthetic driving force and shear stress via atomistic
simulations. It was found that the displacements of some shear-coupling GBs do
not exhibit a linear or approximately linear relation with the time, as widely
assumed, but evidently exhibit an acceleration tendency. Moreover, the boundary
velocity significantly decreases when increasing the bicrystal size
perpendicular to the GB plane. These behaviors were verified to be independent
of the magnitude and type of driving force but closely related to the
temperature and revealed to be unique to shear-coupling GBs exhibiting a rise
in the kinetic energy component along the shear direction. Moreover, after many
attempts, we found that the acceleration in migration and size effect can be
largely alleviated by adopting one specific kind of boundary condition.
Nevertheless, the continuous rise of kinetic energy still exists and leads to
the true driving force for GB migration lower than the nominally applied value.
For that reason, a technique is proposed to extract the true driving force
based on a quantitative analysis of the work-energy relation in the bicrystal
system. Accordingly, the calculated true mobility shows that the recently
proposed mobility tensor may not be symmetric at relatively large driving
forces.

In practice, to save the computational cost, the Spatial-Temporal Aggregation

an exactly separable $\gamma$-rigid version of $X(5)$, the solutions are
compared with the $X(5)$ model and some new set of equations that show the
relationships between the two models are stated. In other to show the dynamical
symmetry nature of the solutions, the entire solutions from $\beta_{0}=0$ to
$\beta_{0}=\infty$ are compared with $U(5)$, $X(5)$ and $SU(3)$. The solutions
spread from the region around $U(5)$ over $X(5)$ and approach $SU(3)$ at
$\beta_{0}=\infty$. The exact solutions obtained via variational procedure are
compared favourably with some existing $X(3)$ models found in the literature.
The strong agreement between the present model and $X(3)$ via infinite square
well potential is discussed. Twelve best critical point isotopes, $^{102}$Mo,
$^{104-108}$Ru, $^{120-126}$Xe, $^{148}$Nd, $^{184-188}$Pt are chosen for
experimental realization of the model and moderate agreements are recorded. An
excellent agreement which appears in the first $\beta$-excited state in the
comparison of the present model with three $N=90$ isotones: $^{150}$Nd,
$^{154}$Gd, and $^{156}$Dy, known to be $X(5)$ candidates, suggests that the
present model compensates the $X(5)$ models whose predictions are excellent in
the ground states but moderately bad in the first $\beta$-excited states.

Specifically, we benchmark the r$^2$SCAN-calculated oxidation enthalpies,

Additionally, we evaluate the optimal Hubbard \emph{U} correction required for

increases the lattice parameters, on-site magnetic moments and band gaps of
TMOs, apart from an improved description of the ground state electronic state

with r$^2$SCAN and r$^2$SCAN+\textit{U} predicting marginally larger lattice

autoencoders often suffer from posterior collapse: the posterior of the latent
variables is equal to its prior, rendering the variational autoencoder useless
as a means to produce meaningful representations. Existing approaches to
posterior collapse often attribute it to the use of neural networks or
optimization issues due to variational approximation. In this paper, we
consider posterior collapse as a problem of latent variable
non-identifiability. We prove that the posterior collapses if and only if the
latent variables are non-identifiable in the generative model. This fact
implies that posterior collapse is not a phenomenon specific to the use of
flexible distributions or approximate inference. Rather, it can occur in
classical probabilistic models even with exact inference, which we also
demonstrate. Based on these results, we propose a class of latent-identifiable
variational autoencoders, deep generative models which enforce identifiability
without sacrificing flexibility. This model class resolves the problem of
latent variable non-identifiability by leveraging bijective Brenier maps and
parameterizing them with input convex neural networks, without special
variational inference objectives or optimization tricks. Across synthetic and
real datasets, latent-identifiable variational autoencoders outperform existing
methods in mitigating posterior collapse and providing meaningful

communities globally. However, the mechanisms by which high N availability
causes species loss remain unclear. Many hypotheses for species loss with
increasing N availability highlight density-dependent mechanisms, i.e., changes
in species interactions. However, an alternative set of hypotheses highlights
density-independent detrimental effects of nitrogen (e.g., N toxicity). We
tested the role of density-dependent and density-independent mechanisms in
reducing species performance. For this aim, we used 120 experimental plant
communities comprised of annual species growing together in containers under
four fertilization treatments: (1) no nutrient addition(, (2) all nutrients
except N (P, K, and micronutrients), (3) Low N, and (4) high N. Each
fertilization treatment included two sowing densities to differentiate between
the effects of competition (N * density interactions) and other detrimental
effects of N. We focused on three performance attributes: the probability of
reaching the reproduction period, biomass growth, and population growth. We
found that individual biomass and population growth rates decreased with
increasing sowing density in all nutrient treatments, implying that species
interactions were predominantly negative. The common grass had a higher biomass
and population growth under N enrichment, regardless of sowing density. In
contrast, the legume showed a density-independent reduction in biomass growth
with increasing N. Lastly, the small forb showed a density-dependent reduction
in population growth, i.e., the decline occurred only under high density. Our
results demonstrate that density-dependent and density-independent mechanisms
operate simultaneously to reduce species performance under high N availability.
Yet, their relative importance varies among species and life stages.

naturalness issues more generally) using antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond (KR) fields
rather than their pseudoscalar duals, as suggested by string and higher
dimensional theories. Two types of axions can be identified: a model
independent $S$-type axion dual to a two form $B_{\mu\nu}$ in 4D and a $T$-type
axion coming directly as 4D scalar Kaluza-Klein (KK) components of
higher-dimensional tensor fields. For $T$-type axions our conclusions largely
agree with earlier workers for the axion quality problem, but we also reconcile
why $T$-type axions can couple to matter localized on 3-branes with Planck
suppressed strength even when the axion decay constants are of order the KK
scale. For $S$-type axions, we review the duality between form fields and
massive scalars and show how duality impacts naturalness arguments about the UV
sensitivity of the scalar potential. In particular UV contributions on the KR
side suppress contributions on the scalar side by powers of $m/M$ with $m$ the
axion mass and $M$ the UV scale. We re-examine how the axion quality problem is
formulated on the dual side and compare to recent treatments. We study how
axion quality is affected by the ubiquity of $p$-form gauge potentials (for
both $p=2$ and $p=3$) in string vacua and identify two criteria that can
potentially lead to a problem. We also show why most fields do not satisfy
these criteria, but when they do the existence of multiple fields also provides
mechanisms for resolving it. We conclude that the quality problem is easily
evaded.

directional connectivity. As causal relationships run in both directions, we
explore three scenarios, namely channels' activity as sources, as sinks, and in
total. Our proposed method can be used for both classification and exploratory
analysis. In all scenarios, we find confirmation of the established
right-lateralized Theta sampling network anomaly, in line with the temporal
sampling framework's assumption of oscillatory differences in the Theta and
Gamma bands. Further, we show that this anomaly primarily occurs in the causal
relationships of channels acting as sinks, where it is significantly more
pronounced than when only total activity is observed. In the sink scenario, our
classifier obtains 0.84 and 0.88 accuracy and 0.87 and 0.93 AUC for the Theta
and Gamma bands, respectively.

vision tasks. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain a concrete visual
definition of the informative structures because influences of visual features
are task-specific. In this paper, we propose a single general neural network
architecture for extracting task-specific structure guidance for scenes. To do
this, we first analyze traditional spectral clustering methods, which computes
a set of eigenvectors to model a segmented graph forming small compact
structures on image domains. We then unfold the traditional graph-partitioning
problem into a learnable network, named \textit{Scene Structure Guidance
Network (SSGNet)}, to represent the task-specific informative structures. The
SSGNet yields a set of coefficients of eigenvectors that produces explicit
feature representations of image structures. In addition, our SSGNet is
light-weight ($\sim$ 55K parameters), and can be used as a plug-and-play module
for off-the-shelf architectures. We optimize the SSGNet without any supervision
by proposing two novel training losses that enforce task-specific scene
structure generation during training. Our main contribution is to show that
such a simple network can achieve state-of-the-art results for several
low-level vision applications including joint upsampling and image denoising.
We also demonstrate that our SSGNet generalizes well on unseen datasets,

the current and the diffusion coefficient differ from those for single-particle

non-self-averaging. Based on the extreme value theory, we find that

quantum memory. By utilizing the hyperfine interaction between the central
electron and its surrounding nuclei, quantum information can be transferred to
the collective state of the nuclei and be stored for a long time. However,
nuclear spin fluctuations in a partially polarized nuclear bath deteriorate the
quantum memory fidelity. Here we introduce a noise-resistant protocol to
realize fast and high-fidelity quantum memory through Hamiltonian engineering.
With analytics and numerics, we show that high-fidelity quantum state transfer
between the electron and the nuclear spins is achievable at relatively low
nuclear polarizations, due to the strong suppression of nuclear spin noises.
For a realistic quantum dot with $10^4$ nuclear spins, a fidelity surpassing
80% is possible at a polarization as low as 30%. Our approach reduces the
demand for high nuclear polarization, making experimentally realizing quantum

physics, is the comprehension of the nature of their jet composition. The
investigation of joint polarimetric and spectral properties is essential to
probe the jet composition and radiation mechanism of GRBs. Several distinct
categories of jet properties -- the ``Kinetic-energy-dominated"" (KED),
``Poynting-flux-dominated"" (PFD), and ``Hybrid-dominated"" (HD) jets -- have
been observed in the observed GRB spectra, and the emission dominated by
different jet properties is expected to have a different level of polarization
($\pi_{\rm KED}\lesssim\pi_{\rm HD}\lesssim\pi_{\rm PED}$). In the present
paper, we collected a GRB sample in which all the bursts detected by the
Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the NASA {\it Fermi} Gamma-ray Space
Telescope whose polarization measurements are also reported in the literature
and the epochs of prompt emission are heavily overlapped with their
polarization observations, aiming to establish a connection between the
polarization and jet properties of GRBs, and to confirm the validity of this
correlation ($\pi_{\rm KED}\lesssim\pi_{\rm HD}\lesssim\pi_{\rm PED}$) from
observations. With a detailed spectral analysis, we found that all the bursts
are classified as the ``Hybrid"" jet type, implying that one cannot rule out
that the photosphere emission may also be the possible mechanism powering the
high levels of polarization. Finally, we present different polarization models
in the presence of ordered and random magnetic field configurations with the
properties of corresponding hybrid jets in order to interpret polarization
measurements of the prompt emission in our sample.

electrolysis is a highly nonlinear production process, and most of the data

In the case of infrequent measurements of state variables, the accuracy and
open-loop stability of the long-term predictions become highly important.
Standard neural networks struggle to provide stable long-term predictions with
limited training data. In this work, we investigate the effect of combining
concatenated skip-connections and the sparsity-promoting $\ell_1$

escape over a potential well is in general well-described by Kramers theory.
Kramers showed that the escape time decreases exponentially with increasing
barrier height. The dynamics slow down when the particle is charged and
subjected to a Lorentz force due to an external magnetic field. This is evident
via a rescaling of the diffusion coefficient entering as a prefactor in the
Kramers escape rate without any impact on the barrier-height-dependent
exponent. Here we show that the barrier height can be effectively changed when
the charged particle is subjected to an external vortex flow. While the
external vortex alone does not affect the mean escape time of the particle,
when combined with a magnetic field it effectively pushes the fluctuating
particle either radially outside or inside depending on its sign relative to
that of the magnetic field. In particular, the effective potential over which
the particle escapes can be changed to a flat, a stable, and an unstable
potential by tuning the signs and magnitudes of the external vortex and the
applied magnetic field. Notably, the last case corresponds to enhanced escape
dynamics.

  2022",,,,"cs.LG q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Missing values are a common problem in data science and machine learning.
Removing instances with missing values can adversely affect the quality of
further data analysis. This is exacerbated when there are relatively many more
features than instances, and thus the proportion of affected instances is high.
Such a scenario is common in many important domains, for example, single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets provide a large number of features over
a genome for a relatively small number of individuals. To preserve as much
information as possible prior to modeling, a rigorous imputation scheme is
acutely needed. While Denoising Autoencoders is a state-of-the-art method for
imputation in high-dimensional data, they still require enough complete cases
to be trained on which is often not available in real-world problems. In this
paper, we consider missing value imputation as a multi-label classification
problem and propose Chains of Autoreplicative Random Forests. Using multi-label
Random Forests instead of neural networks works well for low-sampled data as
there are fewer parameters to optimize. Experiments on several SNP datasets
show that our algorithm effectively imputes missing values based only on
information from the dataset and exhibits better performance than standard
algorithms that do not require any additional information. In this paper, the
algorithm is implemented specifically for SNP data, but it can easily be
adapted for other cases of missing value imputation.

(TE) properties of two double half-heusler (HH) alloys X$_2$Ni$_2$InSb
(X=Hf/Zr), using first-principles calculation. These alloys exhibit a rich
phase diagram with the possibility of tetragonal, cubic and solid solution
phase at different temperature range. As such, a comparative study of TE
properties of all these phases is performed. The ordered phases show quite
favorable electronic transport as compared to the disordered ones in both
compounds. Lattice thermal conductivity of double HH alloys is lower than their
ternary counter-part, making them most promising for TE application. Simulated
band gap, obtained using hybrid functional, of ordered phases of
Hf$_2$Ni$_2$InSb and Zr$_2$Ni$_2$InSb lie in the range 0.24-0.4 eV and
0.17-0.59 eV respectively, while for disordered phase, it is 0.05- 0.06 eV.
Hf$_2$Ni$_2$InSb shows a reasonably high ZT value of $\sim$ 2.19, while
Zr$_2$Ni$_2$InSb yields 2.46 at high temperature for n-type conduction in
tetragonal phase. The ZT value for p-type conduction is also quite promising
($\sim$ 1.35 and $\sim$ 2.19 for Hf- and Zr-based compounds). In both the
compounds, electronic transport (Seebeck and electrical conductivity) plays the
dominant role for the high ZT-value. Keeping in mind the promising TE
performance, we propose immediate attention from experimentalists to synthesize
and cross validate our findings for these new candidate materials.

inclination. In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) approach is
developed. Thanks to the knowledge of future changes of traction conditions,
the approach is able to avoid short-term skidding and sliding even under fast
changes of traction conditions. In a first step, an optimal reference
trajectory is determined by a multiple-shooting approach. In a second step, the
reference trajectory is tracked by an MPC setup. The developed method is
simulated along a track with fast-changing traction conditions for different
scenarios, like changing weather conditions and unexpected delays. In all
cases, skidding and sliding is avoided.

Among various measurement tasks, packet loss detection and heavy-hitter

existing works seldom handle both tasks. In this paper, we design ChameleMon to
support the two key tasks simultaneously. One key design/novelty of ChameleMon
is to shift measurement attention as network state changes, through two
dimensions of dynamics: 1) dynamically allocating memory between the two key
tasks; 2) dynamically monitoring the flows of importance. To realize the key
design, we propose a key technique, leveraging Fermat's little theorem to
devise a flexible data structure, namely FermatSketch. FermatSketch is
dividable, additive, and subtractive, supporting the two key tasks. We have
fully implemented a ChameleMon prototype on a testbed with a Fat-tree topology.
We conduct extensive experiments and the results show ChameleMon supports the
two key tasks with low memory/bandwidth overhead, and more importantly, it can
automatically shift measurement attention as network state changes.

research on explicitly quantifying the data quality of each view when fusing

inflexible in downstream remote sensing tasks. To fill this gap, in this paper,
evidential deep learning is introduced to the task of aerial-ground dual-view
remote sensing scene classification to model the credibility of each view.
Specifically, the theory of evidence is used to calculate an uncertainty value
which describes the decision-making risk of each view. Based on this
uncertainty, a novel decision-level fusion strategy is proposed to ensure that
the view with lower risk obtains more weight, making the classification more

dynamics simulations. In the absence of plastic localization and damage
mechanism, the single-crystal mechanical response eventually saturates. We show
that the cyclic saturation stress converges asymptotically to the monotonic
saturation stress as the cycle plastic increment increases, and this
convergence can be observed for some experimental conditions. The analysis of
the experimental literature suggests that the mechanisms controlling the
saturation in single crystals are the same controlling the cyclic response of
polycrystals with large grains. We propose also analytical and approximated
models to predict the saturation stress over the considered loading conditions.
The saturation stress appears as a fundamental property of dislocations,

dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations for viscous and heat
conductive gases with constant viscosities and heat conductivity for fast
decaying density at far fields only. First, it is shown that the specific
entropy becomes not uniformly bounded immediately after the initial time, as
long as the initial density decays to vacuum at the far field at the rate not
slower than $O\left(\frac1{|x|^{\ell_\rho}}\right)$ with $\ell_\rho>2$.
Furthermore, for faster decaying initial density, i.e., $\ell_\rho\geq4$, a
sharper result is discovered that the absolute temperature becomes uniformly
positive at each positive time, no matter whether it is uniformly positive or
not initially, and consequently the corresponding entropy behaves as
$O(-\log(\varrho_0(x)))$ at each positive time, independent of the boundedness
of the initial entropy. Such phenomena are in sharp contrast to the case with
slowly decaying initial density of the rate no faster than $O(\frac1{x^2})$,
for which our previous works \cite{LIXINADV,LIXINCPAM,LIXIN3DK} show that the
uniform boundedness of the entropy can be propagated for all positive time and
thus the temperature decays to zero at the far field. These give a complete
answer to the problem concerning the propagation of uniform boundedness of the
entropy for the heat conductive ideal gases and, in particular, show that the
algebraic decay rate $2$ of the initial density at the far field is sharp for
the uniform boundedness of the entropy. The tools to prove our main results are
based on some scaling transforms, including the Kelvin transform, and a Hopf

straight nodal line with zero Berry phase. The TDPs formed between bands 14,
15, and 16 exhibit type-I crossings and are connected through the open straight
nodal line. Our transport calculations show a large thermopower exceeding
$\sim$500 and $200$ $\rm \mu V/K$ for the hole and electron carriers,
respectively, above 500 K with a carrier doping of 10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$. The
large thermopower in $p$-type CdGeAs$_{2}$ is a consequence of the sharp
density of states appear from the presence of a heavy hole band at the $\Gamma$
point. We argue that the presence of topological states in the phonon bands
could lead to low lattice thermal conductivity and drive a high figure-of-merit
in CdGeAs$_{2}$.

techniques for traffic signal control (TSC), which can adaptively adjusted
traffic signal phase and duration according to real-time traffic data. However,
a fully centralized RL approach is beset with difficulties in a multi-network
scenario because of exponential growth in state-action space with increasing
intersections. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) can overcome the
high-dimension problem by employing the global control of each local RL agent,
but it also brings new challenges, such as the failure of convergence caused by
the non-stationary Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we introduce
an off-policy nash deep Q-Network (OPNDQN) algorithm, which mitigates the
weakness of both fully centralized and MARL approaches. The OPNDQN algorithm
solves the problem that traditional algorithms cannot be used in large
state-action space traffic models by utilizing a fictitious game approach at
each iteration to find the nash equilibrium among neighboring intersections,
from which no intersection has incentive to unilaterally deviate. One of main
advantages of OPNDQN is to mitigate the non-stationarity of multi-agent Markov
process because it considers the mutual influence among neighboring
intersections by sharing their actions. On the other hand, for training a large
traffic network, the convergence rate of OPNDQN is higher than that of existing
MARL approaches because it does not incorporate all state information of each
agent. We conduct an extensive experiments by using Simulation of Urban
MObility simulator (SUMO), and show the dominant superiority of OPNDQN over
several existing MARL approaches in terms of average queue length, episode
training reward and average waiting time.

phenomenological function $G_{\rm eff}(z)$ describing deviations from General
Relativity (GR) in a model-independent manner. In this alternative approach, we
model $\mu\equiv G_\mathrm{eff}/G$ as a Gaussian process and use forecasted
growth-rate measurements from a stage-IV survey to reconstruct its shape for
two different toy-models. We follow a two-step procedure: (i) we first
reconstruct the background expansion history from Supernovae (SNe) and Baryon
Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements; (ii) we then use it to obtain the
growth history $f\sigma_8$, that we fit to redshift-space distortions (RSD)
measurements to reconstruct $G_\mathrm{eff}$. We find that upcoming surveys
such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) might be capable of
detecting deviations from GR, provided the dark energy behavior is accurately
determined. We might even be able to constrain the transition redshift from
$G\to G_\mathrm{eff}$ for some particular models. We further assess the impact
of massive neutrinos on the reconstructions of $G_\mathrm{eff}$ (or $\mu$)
assuming the expansion history is given, and only the neutrino mass is free to
vary. Given the tight constraints on the neutrino mass, and for the profiles we
considered in this work, we recover numerically that the effect of such massive
neutrinos do not alter our conclusions. Finally, we stress that incorrectly
assuming a $\Lambda$CDM expansion history leads to a degraded reconstruction of
$\mu$, and/or a non-negligible bias in the

  the first-passage time and position of a Brownian particle",,,,,"q-bio.MN cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  First passage time (FPT) is the time a particle, subject to some stochastic
process, hits or crosses a closed surface for the very first time.
$\tau$-leaping methods are a class of stochastic algorithms in which, instead
of simulating every single reaction, many reactions are ``leaped"" over in order
to shorten the computing time. In this paper we developed a $\tau$-leaping
method for computing the FPT and position in arbitrary volumes for a Brownian
particle governed by the Langevin equation. The $\tau$-leaping method proposed
here works as follows. A sphere is inscribed within the volume of interest
(VOI) centered at the initial particle's location. On this sphere, the FPT is
sampled, as well as the position, which becomes the new initial position. Then,
another sphere, centered at this new location, is inscribed. This process
continues until the sphere becomes smaller than some minimal radius
$R_{\text{min}}$. When this occurs, the $\tau$-leaping switches to the
conventional Monte Carlo, which runs until the particle either crosses the
surface of the VOI or finds its way to a position where a sphere of radius
$>R_{\text{min}}$ can be inscribed. The switching between $\tau$-leaping and MC
continues until the particle crosses the surface of the VOI. The size of this
radius depends on the system parameters and on one's notion of accuracy: the
larger this radius the more accurate the $\tau$-leaping method, but also less
efficient. This trade off between accuracy and efficiency is discussed. For two
VOI, the $\tau$-leaping method is shown to be accurate and more efficient than
MC by at least a factor of 10 and up to a factor of about 110. However, while
MC becomes exponentially slower with increasing VOI, the efficiency of the
$\tau$-leaping method remains relatively unchanged. Thus, the $\tau$-leaping
method can potentially be many orders of magnitude more efficient than MC.

above which neutrino-antineutrino interactions dominate over the Standard Model
neutrino-nucleon scattering. We argue that, although in this regime a
redistribution of the neutrino energies might take place, making low-energy
neutrinos more trapped, this only affects a small part of the neutrino
population and it cannot be constrained with the SN 1987A data. Thus, contrary
to previous claims, the region of the parameter space where the

magnetic moment is not ruled out. We then focus on small gauge couplings, where
the decay length of the new gauge boson is larger than the neutrino-nucleon
mean free path, but still smaller than the size of proto-neutron star. We show
for the first time that in this regime, the resonant production of a long-lived
$Z'$ and its subsequent decay into neutrinos can significantly reduce the
duration of the neutrino burst, probing values of the coupling below ${\cal
O}(10^{-7})$ for mediator masses between 10 and 100~MeV. This rules out new

$\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ of a general bivariate location/scale model, when the
ordering between the parameters is known apriori (say, $\theta_1\leq
\theta_2$), has been considered. We consider isotonic regression estimators
based on the best location/scale equivariant estimators (BLEEs/BSEEs) of
$\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ with general weight functions. Let $\mathcal{D}$
denote the corresponding class of isotonic regression estimators of
$(\theta_1,\theta_2)$. Under the sum of the weighted squared error loss
function, we characterize admissible estimators within the class $\mathcal{D}$,
and identify estimators that dominate the BLEE/BSEE of ($\theta_1$,$\theta_2$).
Our study unifies several studies reported in the literature for specific
probability distributions having independent marginals. We also report a
generalized version of the Katz (1963) result on the inadmissibility of certain
estimators under a loss function that is weighted sum of general loss functions
for component problems. A simulation study is also carried out to validate the

non-zero brane curvature caused by an effective cosmological constant {\Omega}

analyze the case where the maximally warped brane is identified as the visible
brane. For {\Omega} < 0, resolution of the gauge hierarchy problem imposes a
small upper bound on |{\Omega}|, and can possibly lead to positivity of all the
3-brane tensions. For {\Omega} > 0, the latter is not possible but the tuning
of the cosmological constant to its tiny observed value is linked to the tuning
of the extra dimensional moduli close to the inverse Planck length, justifying
the original flat brane approximation. In both regimes, we study the dependence
of the scale-clustering of the pair of TeV-branes on the brane cosmological
constant and hence its potential role in generating a fermion mass hierarchy
between these branes. Identifying the near-maximally warped brane as the
visible brane instead opens up regions in the parameter space that allow
positive 3-brane tensions for both anti de Sitter and de Sitter branes, subject
to non-trivial constraints on the warping parameters. We conclude by

They record volcanic events and crust formation episodes in primordial
planetesimals that took place about 4.565 Myr ago. However, no analogue for
these meteorites has been found in the asteroid population to date. Aims. We
searched for spectroscopic analogues of the andesitic meteorite Erg Chech 002
in the asteroid population using the Gaia DR3 spectral dataset. Methods. In
order to identify which asteroids have the most similar spectrum to Erg Chech
002, we first determined the spectral parameters of Gaia DR3 asteroids
(spectral slope and Band I depth) and compared them to the spectral parameters
of different samples of the meteorite. In addition, we performed a spectral
curve matching between Erg Chech 002 and Gaia DR3 asteroid data, and we
compared the results of both methods. Results. We found that 51 main-belt
asteroids have a visible spectrum similar to the one of Erg Chech 002, and 91
have a spectrum similar to the space-weathered spectra of the meteorite,
corresponding to 0.08 and 0.15% of the whole Gaia DR3 dataset of asteroids with
spectra, respectively. The asteroids that best match the laboratory samples of
the meteorite are mostly located in the inner main belt, while the objects
matching the space-weathered meteorite models show slightly more scattering
across the belt. Conclusions. Despite the fact that we find asteroids that
potentially match Erg Chech 002, these asteroids are extremely rare. Moreover,
a visible spectrum alone is not completely diagnostic of an Erg Chech 002-like
composition. Near-infrared spectra will be important to confirm (or rule out)
the spectral matches between Erg Chech 002 and the candidate asteroid
population.

$\mathbb{B}$. Different automata for a fixed language $L$ produce TQFTs that
differ by their values on decorated circles, while the values on decorated

associated to an automaton can be given a path integral interpretation.
  In this TQFT the state space of a one-point 0-manifold is a free module over
$\mathbb{B}$ with the basis of states of the automaton. Replacing a free module
by a finite projective $\mathbb{B}$-module $P$ allows to generalize automata
and this type of TQFT to a structure where defects act on open subsets of a
finite topological space. Intersection of open subsets induces a multiplication
on $P$ allowing to extend the TQFT to a TQFT for one-dimensional foams
(oriented graphs with defects modulo a suitable equivalence relation).
  A linear version of these constructions is also explained, with the Boolean

work of Bogoliubov-Shirkov, Steinmann, Ruelle, and Epstein-Glaser-Stora. In
this paper, we give a fully explicit account in terms of modern theory
developed by Aguiar-Mahajan. We describe the central construction of causal
perturbation theory as a homomorphism from the Hopf monoid of set compositions,
decorated with local observables, into the Wick algebra of microcausal
polynomial observables. The operator-valued distributions called (generalized)
time-ordered products and (generalized) retarded products are obtained as
images of fundamental elements of this Hopf monoid under the curried
homomorphism. The perturbative S-matrix scheme corresponds to the so-called
universal series, and the property of causal factorization is naturally
expressed in terms of the action of the Hopf monoid on itself by Hopf powers,
called the Tits product. Given a system of fully renormalized time-ordered
products, the perturbative construction of the corresponding interacting
products is via an up biderivation of the Hopf monoid, which recovers
Bogoliubov's formula.

co-registration, an original calibration method using a specifically designed

temporal off-set through global optimization of the reconstructed sharpness and
superposition of calibration phantom structures. Phantom design and cost
function metrics were selected based on analysis of a numerical phantom, and
resulted in a high estimation accuracy for the 7 parameters. Experimental
estimations validated the calibration repeatability. The estimated parameters
were used for bimodal reconstruction of additional phantoms with either
identical or distinct spatial distributions of US and PA contrasts.
Superposition distance of the two modes was within < 10% of the acoustic

dual-mode PA/US tomography should contribute to more sensitive and robust

employ pre-defined vector representations to improve generalization by

self-supervised predictive model that captures the context of words using a

corpus-wide word co-occurrence statistics. Such word embedding has
significantly boosted important NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis,
document classification, and machine translation. However, the embeddings are
dense floating-point vectors, making them expensive to compute and difficult to

words with a few defining words that are related using propositional logic. To
produce such logical embeddings, we introduce a Tsetlin Machine-based

consider how often the congruence $|\widetilde{E}_p(\mathbb{F}_p)|\equiv a\mod

$|\widetilde{E}_p(\mathbb{F}_p)|$ over all rational primes $p$ cannot exceed
$4$. We then exhibit elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}(t)$ with trivial torsion
for which the orders of reductions of every smooth fiber modulo primes of
positive density at least $1/2$ are divisible by a fixed small integer. We also
show that if the torsion of $E$ grows over a quadratic field $K$, then one may
explicitly compute $|\widetilde{E}_p(\mathbb{F}_p)|$ modulo the torsion
subgroup $|E(K)_{tors}|$. More precisely, we show that there exists an integer
$N\ge 2$ such that $|\widetilde{E}_p(\mathbb{F}_p)|$ is determined modulo
$|E(K)_{tors}|$ according to the arithmetic progression modulo $N$ in which $p$
lies. It follows that given any $a$ modulo $|E(K)_{tors}|$, we can estimate the

optimization problems, such as hyperparameter tuning and meta-learning. A
common goal in bilevel optimization is to find stationary points of the
hyper-objective function. Although this hyper-objective approach is widely
used, its theoretical properties have not been thoroughly investigated in cases
where the lower-level functions lack strong convexity. In this work, we take a
step forward and study the hyper-objective approach without the typical
lower-level strong convexity assumption. Our hardness results show that the
hyper-objective of general convex lower-level functions can be intractable
either to evaluate or to optimize. To tackle this challenge, we introduce the
gradient dominant condition, which strictly relaxes the strong convexity
assumption by allowing the lower-level solution set to be non-singleton. Under
the gradient dominant condition, we propose the Inexact Gradient-Free Method
(IGFM), which uses the Switching Gradient Method (SGM) as the zeroth order
oracle, to find an approximate stationary point of the hyper-objective. We also
extend our results to nonsmooth lower-level functions under the weak sharp
minimum condition.

rock physics and seismology. Unlike sandstones, shales are mixtures of sand
grains and clays with extremely low porosity and permeability. Swelling of
clays upon wetting induce micro-cracks at grain-clay interfaces and results in
the strong elastic wave scattering. Such scattering prevents adequate
measurements of the absorption from ballistic wave attenuations. Here we infer
this intrinsic attenuation from multiply scattered waves as in seismology and
ultrasonics. We find that increasing confining pressure reduces the scattering
attenuation by micro-crack closure but increases surprisingly the absorption,
likely due to the viscous dissipation involved with more liquids adsorbed in
clays and at grain surfaces. Also, we observe that cyclic heating and cooling
causes the shrinkage of clays and the growth of microcracks as well as the
nucleation of macro-fractures. This leads to a predominant chaotic
reverberation in this fractured shale. Numerical simulations based on X-ray
tomography of the fractured sample confirm the multiple scattering behavior and
reveal the increase of a characteristic length from an initial intact to a
finally fractured shale. This study helps to improve acoustic techniques for
multiscale exploration of gas and oil in shales and other fractured rocks.

Therefore, our first contribution is an open benchmark coined IRT2 (inductive

Such effects may be reduced by using phase encoding instead of frequency
encoding readout gradients. Demonstration of the benefits of phase encoding are
lacking, and the conditions in which it is preferred are not clearly
established. We quantify when phase encoding outperforms a readout gradient
with emphasis on the detrimental effects of diffusion on SNR and resolution. A
15.2T MRI scanner, with 1 T/m gradients, and micro solenoid RF coils < 1 mm in
diameter, were used to quantify diffusion effects on resolution and SNR of
frequency and phase encoded acquisitions. Frequency and phase encoding
resolution and SNR per square root time were calculated and measured for images
at the diffusion limited resolution. The point-spread-function was measured for
phase and frequency encoding using additional constant time gradients with
voxels 3-15 microns. The effect of diffusion during the readout gradient on SNR
was experimentally demonstrated. The achieved resolutions of frequency and
phase encoded acquisitions were measured via the point-spread-function. SNR per
square root time and actual resolution were calculated for a wide range of
gradient amplitudes, diffusion coefficients, and relaxation properties. The
results provide a practical guide on how to choose between phase and frequency
encoding. Images of excised rat spinal cord at 10 x 10 microns in-plane
demonstrate benefits of phase encoding in the form of higher measured
resolution and SNR vs the same image acquired with a conventional readout. We

potential acting on the components of EEV can induce tidally excited

eigenmode spectra of the EEV components and the tidal forcing frequencies
depends on the initial parameters of the system. We synthesised 20,000
evolutionary models of the EEVs across the MS. Later, we calculated the
eigenfrequencies for each model. We focused only on the $l=2$, $m=0,+2$ modes.
Knowing the temporal changes in the orbital parameters of simulated EEVs and
the changes of the eigenfrequency spectra for both components, we were able to
determine so-called `resonance curves', which describe the overall chance of a
resonance occurring. We analysed the resonance curves by constructing basic
statistics for them and analysing their morphology using machine learning
methods, including the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection tool. The
EEV resonance curves from our sample are characterised by striking diversity,
including the occurrence of exceptionally long resonances or the absence of
resonances for long evolutionary times. Both components may be subject to
increased resonance rates as they approach the TAMS. On average, we should
observe TEOs more frequently in EEVs containing massive components than
intermediate-mass ones. TEOs will be particularly well-pronounced for EEVs with
the component(s) close to the TAMS. Given the total number of resonances and

contributing to having a higher level of certainty in decision-making. Due to
the randomness inherent to meteorological events (e.g., wind speeds), making
highly accurate long-term predictions for wind power can be extremely
difficult. One approach to remedy this challenge is to utilize weather
information from multiple points across a geographical grid to obtain a
holistic view of the wind patterns, along with temporal information from the
previous power outputs of the wind farms. Our proposed CNN-RNN architecture
combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) to extract spatial and temporal information from multi-dimensional input
data to make day-ahead predictions. In this regard, our method incorporates an
ultra-wide learning view, combining data from multiple numerical weather
prediction models, wind farms, and geographical locations. Additionally, we
experiment with global forecasting approaches to understand the impact of
training the same model over the datasets obtained from multiple different wind
farms, and we employ a method where spatial information extracted from
convolutional layers is passed to a tree ensemble (e.g., Light Gradient
Boosting Machine (LGBM)) instead of fully connected layers. The results show
that our proposed CNN-RNN architecture outperforms other models such as LGBM,
Extra Tree regressor and linear regression when trained globally, but fails to
replicate such performance when trained individually on each farm. We also
observe that passing the spatial information from CNN to LGBM improves its
performance, providing further evidence of CNN's spatial feature extraction
capabilities.

opportunities, i.e., associated BF training (A-BFT) slots, which results in
severe collisions and significant BF training latency, especially in dense user
scenarios. In this paper, we first develop an analytical model to evaluate the
BF training protocol performance. Our analytical model accounts for various
protocol components, including user density, the number of A-BFT slots, and
protocol parameters, i.e., retry limit and contention window size. We then
derive the average successful BF training probability, the BF training
efficiency and latency. Since the derived BF training efficiency is an implicit
function, to reveal the relationship between system parameters and BF training
performance, we also derive an approximate expression of BF training
efficiency. Theoretical analysis indicates that the BF training efficiency
degrades drastically in dense user scenarios. To address this issue, we propose
an enhancement scheme which adaptively adjusts the protocol parameters in tune
with user density, to improve the BF training performance in dense user

policy for millimeter (mmWave) dense networks, which cooperatively utilizes the
cache resource of users and SBSs in proximity. In the proposed DCEC policy, a
content can be cached in either users' devices or SBSs according to the content
popularity, and a user can retrieve the requested content from neighboring
users via D2D links or the neighboring SBSs via cellular links to efficiently
exploit the cache diversity. Unlike existing cooperative caching policies in
the lower frequency bands that require complex interference management
techniques to suppress interference, we take advantage of directional antenna
in mmWave systems to ensure high transmission rate whereas mitigating
interference footprint. Taking the practical directional antenna model and the
network density into consideration, we derive closed-form expressions of the
backhaul offloading performance and content retrieval delay based on the
stochastic information of network topology. In addition, analytical results
indicate that, with the increase of the network density, the content retrieval

here. The steering ellipsoids of two-qubit states that have undergone local
operations on both the qubits so as to bring the state to its canonical form
are the so-called canonical steering ellipsoids. We construct and analyze the
geometric features of the canonical steering ellipsoids corresponding to pure

fixed semiaxes lengths $1/\sqrt{N-1}$ and $1/(N-1)$. The states belonging to

result, monitoring consumption from different appliances using sensors is not
cost-effective. To address this challenge, studies have focused on analyzing
measurements of the total domestic consumption using Machine Learning (ML)
methods, to disaggregate water usage into each appliance. Identifying which
appliances are in use through ML is challenging since their operation may be
overlapping, while specific appliances may operate with intermittent flow,
making individual consumption events hard to distinguish. Moreover, ML
approaches require large amounts of labeled input data to train their models,
which are typically not available for a single household, while usage
characteristics may vary in different regions. In this work, we initially
propose a data model that generates synthetic time series based on regional
water usage characteristics and resolution to overcome the need for a large

real labeled data from the studied region. Following this, we propose a new

neglect the label semantics by simply treating labels as integer IDs. We find
that many activities in the current HAR datasets have shared label names, e.g.,
""open door"" and ""open fridge"", ""walk upstairs"" and ""walk downstairs"". Through
some exploratory analysis, we find that such shared structure in activity names
also maps to similarity in the input features. To this end, we design a
sequence-to-sequence framework to decode the label name semantics rather than
classifying labels as integer IDs. Our proposed method decomposes learning
activities into learning shared tokens (""open"", ""walk""), which is easier than
learning the joint distribution (""open fridge"", ""walk upstairs"") and helps
transfer learning to activities with insufficient data samples. For datasets
originally without shared tokens in label names, we also offer an automated

Extensive experiments on seven HAR benchmark datasets demonstrate the

In this paper, we propose NeuroTalk, which converts non-invasive brain signals
of imagined speech into the user's own voice. Our model was trained with spoken
speech EEG which was generalized to adapt to the domain of imagined speech,
thus allowing natural correspondence between the imagined speech and the voice
as a ground truth. In our framework, automatic speech recognition decoder
contributed to decomposing the phonemes of generated speech, thereby displaying
the potential of voice reconstruction from unseen words. Our results imply the
potential of speech synthesis from human EEG signals, not only from spoken
speech but also from the brain signals of imagined speech.

The toxins and
gaseous emissions from brick kilns leads to SMOG. It is a mixture of invisible
toxic gases such as carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O$_3$), sulphur dioxide
(SO$_2$) and particulate matter like soot and carcinogens. We propose how low
spatial resolution remote sensing data can be used to identify illegal
industrial activity i.e. kiln operation particularly during winter SMOG period
through heat signature values and the concentration of gases like CO, NO$_2$,
SO$_2$ and O$_3$ in the atmosphere.

generate realistic microscopy image data in 2D and 3D based on simulated
sketches of cellular structures. Multiple data sets are used as an inspiration
to simulate sketches of different cellular structures, allowing to generate
fully-annotated image data sets without requiring human interactions. Those
data sets are used to train segmentation approaches and demonstrate that
annotation-free segmentation of cellular structures in fluorescence microscopy
image data can be achieved, thereby leaping towards the ultimate goal of
eliminating the necessity of human annotation efforts.

  multi-physical null medium",,,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simultaneously manipulating multiple physical fields plays an important role
in the increasingly complex integrated systems, aerospace equipment,
biochemical productions, etc. For on-chip systems with high integration level
(e.g., electronic/photonic chips and radio-frequency/microwave circuits), where
both electromagnetic information/energy transporting and heat
dissipation/recovery need to be considered, the precise and efficient control
of the propagation of electromagnetic waves and heat fluxes simultaneously is
particularly important. In this study, we propose a graphical designing method
based on thermal-electromagnetic null medium to simultaneously control the
propagation of electromagnetic waves and thermal fields according to the
pre-designed paths. A thermal-electromagnetic cloak, which can create a
cloaking effect on both electromagnetic waves and thermal fields
simultaneously, is designed by thermal-electromagnetic surface transformation
and verified by both numerical simulations and experimental measurements. The
thermal-electromagnetic surface transformation proposed in this study provides
a new methodology for simultaneous controlling on electromagnetic and
temperature fields, which can be used to realize a series of novel
thermal-electromagnetic devices such as thermal-electromagnetic shifter,
splitter, bender, multiplexer and mode converter. The designed
thermal-electromagnetic cloak opens up new ways to create a concealed region
where any object within it does not create any disturbance to the external
electromagnetic waves and temperature fields simultaneously, which may have
significant applications in improving thermal-electromagnetic compatibility
problem, protecting of thermal-electromagnetic sensitive components, and
improving efficiency of energy usage for complex on-chip systems.

  based approach","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1901.00444",,,,"cs.LG cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Matrix Factorization (MF) on large scale data takes substantial time on a
Central Processing Unit (CPU). While Graphical Processing Unit (GPU)s could
expedite the computation of MF, the available memory on a GPU is finite.
Leveraging GPUs require alternative techniques that allow not only parallelism
but also address memory limitations. Synchronization between computation units,
isolation of data related to a computational unit, sharing of data between
computational units and identification of independent tasks among computational
units are some of the challenges while leveraging GPUs for MF. We propose a
block based approach to matrix factorization using Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) that is aimed at accelerating MF on GPUs. The primary motivation for the
approach is to make it viable to factorize extremely large data sets on limited
hardware without having to compromise on results. The approach addresses
factorization of large scale data by identifying independent blocks, each of
which are factorized in parallel using multiple computational units. The
approach can be extended to one or more GPUs and even to distributed systems.
The RMSE results of the block based approach are with in acceptable delta in
comparison to the results of CPU based variant and multi-threaded CPU variant
of similar SGD kernel implementation. The advantage, of the block based
variant, in-terms of speed are significant in comparison to other variants.

computing to leverage edge data centers to process, store, and analyze data
close to the source. Traditional cloud computing architectures are not designed
for latency-critical applications such as AI (Artificial Intelligence) and IoT
(Internet Of Things) because they rely on low data volumes generated by
applications running near highly-populated areas. When volume grows beyond 50
miles from the population center, networks experience higher latency and packet
loss rates which impacts application performance. Since everyone's life is
equipped with more and more IoT devices by the day, decisions should be made at
a split second in edge computing. It is really crucial to perform at optimum
level, some devices specially the medical wearables deal with patient life and
any delay in decision making will result in disaster. Similarly, modern day
autonomous self driving vehicles where late decisions can endup in accidents
and really there is no room for any errors.
  This paper provides a new approach to improve performance of the edge
computing by having two identical computing systems in which one system will
act as primary and another as reserved or secondary, this system will be
available at the local environment of the IoT device and not in cloud. The
secondary system will be reserved for mission critical requests and whenever
the primary system breaches latency threshold for response only then the
request will be re-routed to the secondary system. Both the systems will sync
data on background and can also serve as backup computing systems in case of
any failure to one of the systems.

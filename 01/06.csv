environments can be a difficult task for those with less experience in using
learning algorithms or creating visual environments to execute an agent-based
simulation. In this paper, the use of game engines as a tool to create and
execute graphic simulations with 3D sensing characters is being explored with
plugins such as ML-Agents for the Unity3D game engine. This allows the
simulation of agents using off-the-shelf algorithms and using the game engine's
motor for the visualizations of these agents. We explore the use of these tools
to create visual bots for games, and teach them how to play the game until they
reach a level where they can serve as adversaries for real-life players in
interactive games.

this computation boils down to the evaluation of the correlation function of
one twist field and two boundary condition changing operators in the cyclic
orbifold. Exploiting null-vectors of the cyclic orbifold, we derive ordinary
differential equations satisfied by these correlation functions. In particular,
we obtain an explicit expression for the second R\'enyi entropy valid for any
diagonal minimal model, but with a particular set of mixed boundary conditions.
In order to compare our results with numerical data for the Ising and
three-state Potts critical chains, we also identify and compute the leading

non-classical logics into proof systems for other logics, especially classical
logic, using an algebra of constraints. That is, one recovers a proof system
for a target logic by enriching a proof system for another, typically simpler,
logic with an algebra of constraints that act as correctness conditions on the
latter to capture the former; for example, one may use Boolean algebra to give
constraints in a sequent calculus for classical propositional logic to produce
a sequent calculus for intuitionistic propositional logic. The idea behind such
forms of reduction is to obtain a tool for uniform and modular treatment of
proof theory and provide a bridge between semantics logics and their proof
theory. The article discusses the theoretical background of the project and
provides several illustrations of its work in the field of intuitionistic and
modal logics. The results include the following: a uniform treatment of modular
and cut-free proof systems for a large class of propositional logics; a general
criterion for a novel approach to soundness and completeness of a logic with
respect to a model-theoretic semantics; and a case study deriving a
model-theoretic semantics from a proof-theoretic specification of a logic.

arbitrary anomalies without requiring annotated anomalous data during training.
Often, this is achieved by learning a data distribution of normal samples and
detecting anomalies as regions in the image which deviate from this
distribution. Most current state-of-the-art methods use latent variable
generative models operating directly on the images. However, generative models
have been shown to mostly capture low-level features, s.a. pixel-intensities,
instead of rich semantic features, which also applies to their representations.
We circumvent this problem by proposing CRADL whose core idea is to model the
distribution of normal samples directly in the low-dimensional representation
space of an encoder trained with a contrastive pretext-task. By utilizing the
representations of contrastive learning, we aim to fix the over-fixation on
low-level features and learn more semantic-rich representations. Our
experiments on anomaly detection and localization tasks using three distinct
evaluation datasets show that 1) contrastive representations are superior to
representations of generative latent variable models and 2) the CRADL framework
shows competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art.

introduces complex coupling effects and additional resonances and spectral

a 1-$\sigma$ uncertainty of 2.90 arcseconds. This new CoE measurement is 9.2

the optically emitting ejecta. We also derive an explosion age of 2770 $\pm$
500 yr, which is consistent with recent age estimates of $\approx 2500$ yr made
from 3D ejecta reconstructions. We verify our estimates of the CoE and age

team of identically-interested players is competing against an adversarial
player in a zero-sum game. Such games capture many well-studied settings in
game theory, such as congestion games, but go well-beyond to environments
wherein the cooperation of one team -- in the absence of explicit communication
-- is obstructed by competing entities; the latter setting remains poorly
understood despite its numerous applications. Since the seminal work of Von
Stengel and Koller (GEB `97), different solution concepts have received
attention from an algorithmic standpoint. Yet, the complexity of the standard
Nash equilibrium has remained open.
  In this paper, we settle this question by showing that computing a Nash
equilibrium in adversarial team games belongs to the class continuous local
search (CLS), thereby establishing CLS-completeness by virtue of the recent
CLS-hardness result of Rubinstein and Babichenko (STOC `21) in potential games.
To do so, we leverage linear programming duality to prove that any
$\epsilon$-approximate stationary strategy for the team can be extended in
polynomial time to an $O(\epsilon)$-approximate Nash equilibrium, where the
$O(\cdot)$ notation suppresses polynomial factors in the description of the
game. As a consequence, we show that the Moreau envelop of a suitable best
response function acts as a potential under certain natural gradient-based

We hypothesized that deep learning could be used to identify pathological

subjects with a normal tricuspid aortic valve (TAV). In a study of 77 subjects

obtained using deep learning and SCGs were in good agreement with those
obtained by 4D flow MRI. Additionally, subjects with TAV, BAV, MAV, and AS

  Perspectives",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Thermodynamics is a science concerning the state of a system, whether it is
stable, metastable, or unstable. The combined law of thermodynamics derived by
Gibbs about 150 years ago laid the foundation of thermodynamics. In Gibbs
combined law, the entropy production due to internal processes was not
included, and the 2nd law was thus practically removed from the Gibbs combined
law, so it is only applicable to systems under equilibrium. Gibbs further
derived the classical statistical thermodynamics in terms of the probability of
configurations in a system. With the quantum mechanics (QM) developed, the
QM-based statistical thermodynamics was established and connected to classical
statistical thermodynamics at the classical limit as shown by Landau. The
development of density function theory (DFT) by Kohn and co-workers enabled the
QM prediction of properties of the ground state of a system. On the other hand,
the entropy production due to internal processes in non-equilibrium systems was
studied separately by Onsager and Prigogine and co-workers. The digitization of
thermodynamics was developed by Kaufman in the framework of the CALPHAD
modeling of individual phases. Our recently termed zentropy theory integrates
DFT and statistical mechanics through the replacement of the internal energy of
each individual configuration by its DFT-predicted free energy. Furthermore,
through the combined law of thermodynamics with the entropy production as a
function of internal degrees of freedom, it is shown that the kinetic
coefficient matrix of independent internal processes is diagonal with respect
to the conjugate potentials in the combined law, and the cross phenomena
represented by the phenomenological Onsager reciprocal relationships are due to
the dependence of the conjugate potential of the molar quantity in a flux on
nonconjugate potentials.

of the helical edge states, determined from q(2-1)D bulk topology characterized
by topologically non-trivial Wilson loop spectra. We show this finite-size

edges, based on analysis of a tight-binding model derived from
density-functional theory calculations, motivating experimental investigation
of our results. In addition, we find quasi-two-dimensional (q(3-1)D)
finite-size topological phases occur for the STI, yielding helical boundary
modes distinguished from those of the QSHI by a non-trivial magneto-electric
polarizability linked to the original 3D bulk STI. Finite-size topological
phases therefore exhibit signatures associated with the non-trivial topological
invariant of a higher-dimensional bulk. Finally, we find the q(3-2)D STI also
exhibits finite-size topological phases, finding the first signs of
topologically-protected boundary modes of codimension greater than 1 due to
finite-size topology. Finite-size topology of four or higher-dimensional

nuclear processes at high momentum transfer can be approximated by tree graphs
for point-like nucleons supplemented by empirical form factors for each
nucleon. The latter represent the internal structure of the nucleon, and
incorporate nonperturbative physics, which can allow for early onset of scaling
behavior. The nucleon form factors are evaluated at the net momentum transfer
experienced by the given nucleon, with use of $G_E$ for a no-flip contribution
and $G_M$ for a helicity-flip contribution. Results are compared with data
where available. The deuteron photodisintegration asymmetry $\Sigma$ is
obtained with a value of $\Sigma(90^\circ)\simeq -0.06$, which is much closer
to experiment than the value of -1 originally expected. The method also
provides an estimate of the momentum transfer values required for scaling
onset. We find that the deuteron structure function $B$ is a good place to
look, above momentum transfers of 10 GeV$^2$.

pivotal questions on how to reinvent stores and supply chains to meet the
growing demand of the online channel. One of the recent measures adopted by
omnichannel retailers is to address the growth of online sales using in-store
picking, which allows serving online orders using existing assets. However, it
comes with the downside of harming the offline customer experience. To achieve
picking policies adapted to the dynamic customer flows of a retail store, we
formalize a new problem called Dynamic In-store Picker Routing Problem (diPRP).
In this relevant problem - diPRP - a picker tries to pick online orders while
minimizing customer encounters. We model the problem as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP) and solve it using a hybrid solution approach comprising
mathematical programming and reinforcement learning components. Computational
experiments on synthetic instances suggest that the algorithm converges to
efficient policies. Furthermore, we apply our approach in the context of a
large European retailer to assess the results of the proposed policies
regarding the number of orders picked and customers encountered. Our work
suggests that retailers should be able to scale the in-store picking of online
orders without jeopardizing the experience of offline customers. The policies
learned using the proposed solution approach reduced the number of customer
encounters by more than 50% when compared to policies solely focused on picking
orders. Thus, to pursue omnichannel strategies that adequately trade-off
operational efficiency and customer experience, retailers cannot rely on actual
simplistic picking strategies, such as choosing the shortest possible route.

data. We infer that this discrepancy may arise from the DFT+DMFT not being able
to correctly predict certain features in the shape and dispersion of the
unoccupied quasiparticle band near the Fermi level. Therefore, a theoretical
description beyond our DFT+DMFT model is needed to incorporate vital electron
interactions, such as inter-layer electron coupling interactions which for
PdCrO$_2$ gives rise to the Kondo-like so-called intertwined excitation.

  Detection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Face presentation attack detection (PAD) plays a pivotal role in securing
face recognition systems against spoofing attacks. Although great progress has
been made in designing face PAD methods, developing a model that can generalize
well to an unseen test domain remains a significant challenge. Moreover, due to
different types of spoofing attacks, creating a dataset with a sufficient
number of samples for training deep neural networks is a laborious task. This
work addresses these challenges by creating synthetic data and introducing a
deep learning-based unified framework for improving the generalization ability
of the face PAD. In particular, synthetic data is generated by proposing a
video distillation technique that blends a spatiotemporal warped image with a
still image based on alpha compositing. Since the proposed synthetic samples
can be generated by increasing different alpha weights, we train multiple
classifiers by taking the advantage of a specific type of ensemble learning
known as a stacked ensemble, where each such classifier becomes an expert in
its own domain but a non-expert to others. Motivated by this, a meta-classifier
is employed to learn from these experts collaboratively so that when developing
an ensemble, they can leverage complementary information from each other to
better tackle or be more useful for an unseen target domain. Experimental
results using half total error rates (HTERs) on four PAD databases CASIA-MFSD
(6.97 %), Replay-Attack (33.49%), MSU-MFSD (4.02%), and OULU-NPU (10.91%))
demonstrate the robustness of the method and open up new possibilities for
advancing presentation attack detection using ensemble learning with
large-scale synthetic data.

that consistently describes a finite-dimensional system, a part of which is
weakly coupled to a thermal bath. In order to preserve complete positivity and
trace, such a QME must be of Lindblad form. For physical consistency, it should
additionally preserve local conservation laws and be able to show
thermalization. First, we show that the microscopically derived Redfield
equation (RE) violates complete positivity unless in extremely special cases.
We then prove that imposing complete positivity and demanding preservation of
local conservation laws enforces the Lindblad operators and the lamb-shift
Hamiltonian to be `local', i.e, to be supported only on the part of the system
directly coupled to the bath. We then cast the problem of finding `local'
Lindblad QME which can show thermalization into a semidefinite program (SDP).
We call this the thermalization optimization problem (TOP). For given system
parameters and temperature, the solution of the TOP conclusively shows whether
the desired type of QME is possible up to a given precision. Whenever possible,
it also outputs a form for such a QME. For a XXZ chain of few qubits, fixing a
reasonably high precision, we find that such a QME is impossible over a
considerably wide parameter regime when only the first qubit is coupled to the
bath. Remarkably, we find that when the first two qubits are attached to the
bath, such a QME becomes possible over much of the same paramater regime,
including a wide range of temperatures.

mechanical and fluid dynamics macroscale behavior. This motivates the need for
using multiscale models with high biophysical fidelity, even when the outputs

to improve their estimates of the model: more accurate gradients allow them to

which workers communicate over a sparse graph, current theory fails to capture
important aspects of real-world behavior. First, the `spectral gap' of the

larger learning rates than training alone. In fact, it prescribes smaller

accurate picture of sparsely-connected distributed optimization. We quantify
how the graph topology influences convergence in a quadratic toy problem and

discuss annular and rectangular cylinders. Upon deriving the triad amplitude
equations for a finite-depth cylinder of arbitrary cross-section, we deduce
that the triad evolution is always periodic, and determine parameters
controlling the efficiency of energy exchange. In order to excite a particular

predictive process monitoring, anomalous case detection, trace clustering, etc.
These methods are usually performed as preprocessing steps and are responsible
for transforming complex information into a numerical feature space. Most
papers choose existing encoding methods arbitrarily or employ a strategy based
on a specific expert knowledge domain. Moreover, existing methods are employed
by using their default hyperparameters without evaluating other options. This
practice can lead to several drawbacks, such as suboptimal performance and
unfair comparisons with the state-of-the-art. Therefore, this work aims at
providing a comprehensive survey on event log encoding by comparing 27 methods,
from different natures, in terms of expressivity, scalability, correlation, and
domain agnosticism. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most
comprehensive study so far focusing on trace encoding in process mining. It
contributes to maturing awareness about the role of trace encoding in process
mining pipelines and sheds light on issues, concerns, and future research
directions regarding the use of encoding methods to bridge the gap between
machine learning models and process mining.

of the Kromatic symmetric function $\overline{X}_G$, a $K$-theoretic analogue
of the chromatic symmetric function $X_G$ of a graph $G$. The Kromatic
symmetric function is a generating series for graph colorings in which vertices
may receive any nonempty set of distinct colors such that neighboring color
sets are disjoint.
  Our main result lifts a theorem of Gasharov (1996) to this setting, showing
that when $G$ is a claw-free incomparability graph, $\overline{X}_G$ is a
positive sum of symmetric Grothendieck functions. This result suggests a
topological interpretation of Gasharov's theorem. We then show that the
Kromatic symmetric functions of path graphs are not positive in any of several
$K$-analogues of the $e$-basis of symmetric functions, demonstrating that the
Stanley-Stembridge conjecture (1993) does not have such a lift to $K$-theory

a vertex-weighted extension of $\overline{X}_G$ and show that it admits a

that every sum graph has at least one isolated vertex, and every graph can be

Brouwerian semilattices, i.e. relatively pseudocomplemented semilattices. Then
the logical connective implication is considered to be the relative
pseudocomplement and conjunction is the semilattice operation meet. If the
Brouwerian semilattice has a bottom element 0 then the relative
pseudocomplement with respect to 0 is called the pseudocomplement and it is
considered as the connective negation in this logic. Our idea is to consider an
arbitrary meet-semilattice with 0 satisfying only the Ascending Chain
Condition, which is trivially satisfied in finite semilattices, and introduce
the connective negation x^0 as the set of all maximal elements z satisfying
x^z=0 and the connective implication x->y as the set of all maximal elements z
satisfying x^z\le y. Such a negation and implication is ""unsharp"" since it
assigns to one entry x or to two entries x and y belonging to the semilattice,
respectively, a subset instead of an element of the semilattice. Surprisingly,
this kind of negation and implication, respectively, still shares a number of
properties of these connectives in intuitionistic logic, in particular the
derivation rule Modus Ponens. Moreover, unsharp negation and unsharp
implication can be characterized by means of five, respectively seven simple
axioms. Several examples are presented. The concepts of a deductive system and
of a filter are introduced as well as the congruence determined by such a

toward a picture of inside-out galaxy growth consistent with theoretical models

accounting for the possibility that the emitter and cavity photons interact
with a common photonic environment. Using an input-output approach to describe
the open system, we demonstrate that this situation gives rise to an effective
dissipative coupling between the emitter and the cavity. The underlying
mechanism is independent of the nature of the emitter and exists even at zero
temperature; hence our results are potentially relevant for a variety of
experimental platforms. We show that the effective dissipative coupling can
lead to physical effects that do not occur in closed light-matter coupled
systems. In particular, when the radiative decay rates exceed the conventional
Rabi coupling, we can have the phenomenon of level attraction between the
emitter and cavity mode. Our model thus provides a possible explanation for the
level attraction observed in recent photoluminescence measurements in
semiconductor microcavities. Finally, we demonstrate that hybrid light-matter
exceptional points and bound states in the continuum can be realized within
this model.

paper, we seek to unify the output space of visual tasks, so that we can also
build a unified model for visual tasks. To this end, we demonstrate a single
unified model that simultaneously handles two typical visual tasks of instance
segmentation and depth estimation, which have discrete/fixed-length and
continuous/varied-length outputs, respectively. We propose several new
techniques that take into account the particularity of visual tasks: 1) Soft
token. We employ soft token to represent the task output. Unlike hard tokens in
the common VQ-VAE which are assigned one-hot to discrete
codebooks/vocabularies, the soft token is assigned softly to the codebook
embeddings. Soft token can improve the accuracy of both the next token
inference and decoding of the task output; 2) Mask augmentation. Many visual
tasks have corruption, undefined or invalid values in label annotations, i.e.,
occluded area of depth maps. We show that a mask augmentation technique can
greatly benefit these tasks. With these new techniques and other designs, we
show that the proposed general-purpose task-solver can perform both instance

clustering at $z=0$ using a large library of power spectra from the Cosmology
and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project, containing
thousands of $(25\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^3$ volume realizations with varying
cosmology, initial random field, stellar and AGN feedback strength, sub-grid
model implementation, and (magneto)-hydrodynamics methods. We show that
baryonic physics can profoundly affect matter clustering on scales $k \gtrsim
0.1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and the magnitude of this effect is highly dependent
on the details of the galaxy formation implementation and variations of
cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Increasing AGN feedback strength
decreases halo baryon fractions and yields generally stronger suppression of
power relative to N-body simulations, while stronger stellar feedback often
results in weaker overall effects by suppressing black hole growth and
therefore the impact of AGN feedback. We find a broad correlation between mean
baryon fraction of massive halos ($M_{\rm 200c} > 10^{13.5}$ M$_\odot\,h^{-1}$)
and suppression of matter clustering but with significant scatter compared to
previous work owing to wider exploration of feedback parameters and cosmic
variance effects. We show that a random forest regressor trained on the baryon
content and abundance of halos across the full mass range $10^{10} \leq
M_\mathrm{halo}/{\rm M}_{\odot}\,h^{-1} < 10^{14}$ can predict the effect of
galaxy formation on the matter power spectrum on scales $k =

Southern Africa Large Telescope for 42 Seyfert galaxies with Spitzer/IRS
spectroscopy and X-ray to mid-IR multiband data available. After confirming the
power of the main optical ([OIII]) and mid-IR ([NeV], [OIV], [NeIII]) emission
lines in tracing AGN activity, we explore diagrams based on ratios of optical
and mid-IR lines by exploiting photoionization models of different ionizing
sources (AGN, star formation and shocks). We find that pure AGN photoionization
models are good at reproducing observations of Seyfert galaxies with an AGN
fractional contribution to the mid-IR (5-40 micron) emission larger than 50 per
cent. For targets with a lower AGN contribution these same models do not fully
reproduce the observed mid-IR line ratios. Mid-IR ratios like [NeV]/[NeII],
[OIV]/[NeII] and [NeIII]/[NeII] show a dependence on the AGN fractional
contribution to the mid-IR unlike optical line ratios. An additional source of
ionization, either from star formation or radiative shocks, can help explain
the observations in the mid-IR. Among combinations of optical and mid-IR
diagnostics in line ratio diagrams, only those involving the [OI]/Halpha ratio
are promising diagnostics for simultaneously unraveling the relative role of
AGN, star formation and, shocks. A proper identification of the dominant
ionizing source would require the exploitation of analysis tools based on
advanced statistical techniques as well as spatially resolved data.

evolution of such cosmic structures. As a first step towards finding an optimal
indicator of the assembly state of observed structures, we use a cosmological
simulation of a moderate volume to critically examine the best definition of an
indicator that is able to discriminate dark matter haloes undergoing mergers
and/or strong accretion from haloes experimenting a relaxed evolution. Using a
combination of centre offset, virial ratio, mean radial velocity, sparsity and
ellipticity of the dark matter halo, we study how the thresholds on these
parameters, as well as their relative weights, should evolve with redshift to
provide the best classification possible. This allows us to split a sample of
haloes in a totally relaxed, a marginally relaxed and an unrelaxed subsamples.
The resulting classification strongly correlates with the merging activity
obtained from the analysis of complete merger trees extracted from whole
simulation data. The results on how the different indicators depend on redshift

vortices to be pinned by defects in the underlying material. The pinning
capacity of a defect is quantified by the Labusch parameter $\kappa \sim
f_p/\xi\bar{C}$, measuring the pinning force $f_p$ relative to the elasticity
$\bar{C}$ of the vortex lattice, with $\xi$ denoting the coherence length (or
vortex core size) of the superconductor. The critical value $\kappa = 1$
separates weak from strong pinning, with a strong defect at $\kappa > 1$ able
to pin a vortex on its own. So far, this weak-to-strong pinning transition has
been studied for isotropic defect potentials, resulting in a critical exponent
$\mu = 2$ for the onset of the strong pinning force density $F_\mathrm{pin}
\sim n_p f_p (\xi/a_0)^2(\kappa-1)^\mu$, with $n_ p$ denoting the density of
defects and $a_0$ the intervortex distance. The behavior changes dramatically
when studying anisotropic defects with no special symmetries: the strong
pinning then originates out of isolated points with length scales growing as
$\xi (\kappa - 1)^{1/2}$, resulting in a different force exponent $\mu = 5/2$.
Our analysis of the strong pinning onset for arbitrary defect potentials
$e_p(\mathbf{R})$, with $\mathbf{R}$ a planar coordinate, makes heavy use of
the Hessian matrix describing its curvature and leads us to interesting
geometrical structures. Both, onset and merger points are defined by local
differential properties of the Hessian's determinant $D(\mathbf{R})$,
specifically, its minima and saddle points. Extending our analysis to the case
of a random two-dimensional pinning landscape, we discuss the topological
properties of unstable and bistable regions as expressed through the Euler
characteristic, with the latter related to the local differential properties of
$D(\mathbf{R})$ through Morse theory.

multi-component disc-halo modes are driven primarily by the halo, and have
implications for the structural evolution of galaxies, including observations
of lopsidedness and other non-axisymmetric structure. In our simulation, the
modes create surface density features up to 10 per cent relative to the
equilibrium model stellar disc. While the simulated galaxy was constructed to
be in equilibrium, BFE+mSSA also uncovered evidence of persistent periodic
signals incited by aphysical initial conditions disequilibrium, including rings
and weak two-armed spirals, both at the 1 per cent level. The method is
sensitive to distinct evolutionary features at and even below the 1 per cent

both modes and disequilibrium, efficiently removing variance owing to estimator
noise from the input BFE time series. The discovery of multi-component

data guaranteed to evolve indefinitely in these theories in the absence of an
outside driving term? We answer this question in the negative, demonstrating
that arbitrarily low amplitude initial data can still lead to the breakdown of
the theory. Namely, ingoing spherically symmetric wave packets in more than one

bounds the distance from minima by objective function suboptimality. It leads
to the acceleration of first-order methods via restarts. However, sharpness
involves problem-specific constants that are typically unknown, and previous
restart schemes reduce convergence rates. Moreover, such schemes are
challenging to apply in the presence of noise or approximate model classes
(e.g., in compressive imaging or learning problems), and typically assume that
the first-order method used produces feasible iterates. We consider the
assumption of approximate sharpness, a generalization of sharpness that
incorporates an unknown constant perturbation to the objective function error.
This constant offers greater robustness (e.g., with respect to noise or
relaxation of model classes) for finding approximate minimizers. By employing a
new type of search over the unknown constants, we design a restart scheme that
applies to general first-order methods and does not require the first-order
method to produce feasible iterates. Our scheme maintains the same convergence
rate as when assuming knowledge of the constants. The rates of convergence we
obtain for various first-order methods either match the optimal rates or
improve on previously established rates for a wide range of problems. We
showcase our restart scheme on several examples and point to future
applications and developments of our framework and theory.

of quantum mechanics, and a field that just keeps on delivering new insights
and applications. With the arrival of cavity and circuit quantum
electrodynamics we can now achieve strong light-matter couplings which form the
basis of most implementations of quantum technology. But quantum information
processing also has high demands requiring total error rates of fractions of
percentage in order to be scalable (fault-tolerant) to useful applications.
Since errors can also arise from modelling, this has brought into center stage
one of the key approximations of quantum theory, the Rotating Wave
Approximation (RWA) of the quantum Rabi model, leading to the Jaynes-Cummings
Hamiltonian. While the RWA is often very good and incredibly useful to
understand light-matter interactions, there is also growing experimental
evidence of regimes where it is a bad approximation. Here, we ask and answer a
harder question: for which experimental parameters is the RWA, although perhaps
qualitatively adequate, already not good enough to match the demands of
scalable quantum technology? For example, when is the error at least, and when
at most, 1\%? To answer this, we develop rigorous non-perturbative bounds
taming the RWA.
  We find that these bounds not only depend, as expected, on the ratio of the
coupling strength and the oscillator frequency, but also on the average number
of photons in the initial state. This confirms recent experiments on
photon-dressed Bloch-Siegert shifts. We argue that with experiments reporting
controllable cavity states with hundreds of photons and with quantum error
correcting codes exploring more and more of Fock space, this state-dependency
of the RWA is increasingly relevant for the field of quantum computation, and
our results pave the way towards a better understanding of those experiments.

describe the nonlinear behaviour of long-wavelength non-propagating (NP) modes

particular attention to their excitation of, and reaction to, kinetic
micro-instabilities. The perpendicularly pressure balanced polarization of NP
modes produces an excess of perpendicular pressure over parallel pressure in
regions where the plasma $\beta$ is increased. For mode amplitudes $\delta
B/B_0 \gtrsim 0.3$, this excess excites the mirror instability. Particle
scattering off these micro-scale mirrors frustrates the nonlinear saturation of
transit-time damping, ensuring that large-amplitude NP modes continue their
decay to small amplitudes. At asymptotically large wavelengths, we predict that
the mirror-induced scattering will be large enough to interrupt transit-time
damping entirely, isotropizing the pressure perturbations and morphing the
collisionless NP mode into the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) entropy mode. In fast
waves, a fluctuating pressure anisotropy drives both mirror and firehose
instabilities when the wave amplitude satisfies $\delta B/B_0 \gtrsim
2\beta^{-1}$. The induced particle scattering leads to delayed shock formation
and MHD-like wave dynamics. Taken alongside prior work on self-interrupting
Alfv\'en waves and self-sustaining ion-acoustic waves, our results establish a

formulation. Moreover, in the presence of anti-ferromagnetic order, a continuum
effective field theory for holons is developed near half-filling. It reveals
the competition between repulsive and attractive holon interactions induced by
spinon fluctuations and gauge fluctuations, respectively. At a large value of

dominates, leading to the SC order. Possible experimental detection of

prohibitive full frequency approaches are usually required. In this paper we
propose a numerical approach to $GW$ calculations on metals that takes into

semiconductors and overcomes several limitations of PPA. We now demonstrate
that MPA can be successfully extended to metallic systems by optimizing the
frequency sampling for this class of materials and introducing a simple method
to include the $\mathbf{q}\to 0$ limit of the intra-band contributions. The

many methods have been proposed to deal with this problem, some can scale
poorly with the number of predictors in a data set. Screening methods scale
linearly with the number of predictors by checking each predictor one at a
time, and are a tool used to decrease the number of variables to consider
before further analysis or variable selection. For classification, there is a
variety of techniques. There are parametric based screening tests, such as
t-test or SIS based screening, and non-parametric based screening tests, such
as Kolmogorov distance based screening, and MV-SIS. We propose a method for
variable screening that uses Bayesian-motivated tests, compare it to SIS based
screening, and provide example applications of the method on simulated and real
data. It is shown that our screening method can lead to improvements in
classification rate. This is so even when our method is used in conjunction
with a classifier, such as DART, which is designed to select a sparse subset of
variables. Finally, we propose a classifier based on kernel density estimates
that in some cases can produce dramatic improvements in classification rates

spatially separated parties such that the information is locked. This implies
that the parties are not able to extract the information completely via local
operations and classical communication (LOCC) while it might be possible via
LOCC when the parties share entanglement. In this work, we consider an
information distribution protocol using orthogonal states for m >= 3 spatially
separated parties such that even if any k <= (m-1) parties collaborate still
the information cannot be revealed completely. Such a protocol is useful to
understand up to what extent the encoded information remains locked. However,
if required, the parties can share entanglement and extract the information
completely by LOCC. To make the process resource efficient, it should consume
less number of entangled states. We show that though the set of states, which
are locally indistinguishable across every bipartition, are sufficient for the
above protocol, they may consume higher number of entangled states when aiming
for complete information extraction. We establish this by constructing a class
of locally indistinguishable sets of orthogonal states which can be employed to
accomplish the above protocol and these sets consume less number of entangled
states, compared to the former sets, for complete information extraction. In
fact, this difference in the number of required entangled states for complete

and have been achieving remarkable performance in a variety of complex tasks.
Nevertheless, their integration into safety-critical systems, such as in the
aerospace or automotive domains, poses a significant challenge due to the
threat of adversarial inputs: perturbations in inputs that might cause the DNN
to make grievous mistakes. Multiple studies have demonstrated that even modern
DNNs are susceptible to adversarial inputs; and this risk must thus be measured
and mitigated to allow the deployment of DNNs in safety-critical systems.
  Here, we present gRoMA (global Robustness Measurement and Assessment), an
innovative and scalable tool that implements a probabilistic verification
approach to measure the global categorial robustness of a DNN. Specifically,
gRoMA measures the probability of encountering adversarial inputs for a
specific output category. Our tool operates on pre-trained, black-box
classification DNNs, and generates input samples belonging to an output
category of interest. It measures the DNN's susceptibility to adversarial
inputs around these inputs, and aggregates the results to infer the overall
global categorial robustness of the DNN up to some small bounded statistical
error.
  We evaluate our tool on the popular Densenet DNN model over the CIFAR10
dataset. Our results reveal significant gaps in the robustness of the different
output categories. This experiment demonstrates the usefulness and scalability
of our approach, and its potential for allowing DNNs to be deployed within

the strategy differs for the apparent magnitude limit. Finally, we prove that

levels of $\sim$28 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. This spans an extremely large radial
range of more than 14 half-mass radii. Combined with archival globular cluster
(GC) number density maps and a new analysis of the total mass distribution

subpopulation traces well the stellar mass density profile from 2.4 out to even
14 half-mass radii, while the blue GC subpopulation traces the total mass
density profile of the galaxy over a large radial range. Our results reinforce
the scenario that red GCs form mostly in-situ along with the stellar component
of the galaxy, while the blue GCs are more closely aligned with the total mass
distribution in the halo and were accreted along with halo matter. We conclude
that for galaxies where the X-ray emission from the hot halo is too faint to be
properly observable and as such is not available to measure the dark matter
profile, the blue GC population can be used to trace this dark matter component
out to large radii.

class of peak-constrained DPC that is applicable to the optical wireless BC,
where the channel state (i.e, `dirt') takes values from some evenly-spaced
grid. For the discrete-state DPC studied this paper, a capacity upper bound is
obtained from its state-free counterpart. To lower bound its capacity,
classical dirty paper coding schemes are revisited, including Costa's coding
for DPC and Tomlinson-Harashima (TH) precoding, which serves as benchmark
schemes. To improve the benchmark performance, two new precoding schemes are
proposed for the discrete-state DPC. Although the proposed schemes do not
achieve the state-free capacity contrary to what is known about the Costa's
DPC, achievable rates within a small gap to the state-free capacity are
demonstrated for the discrete-state DPC. Using the proposed precoding scheme in
a two-user peak-constrained Gaussian BC, a new capacity inner bound (IB) is
obtained, and is shown to outperform the truncated Gaussian (TG) based IB and
is comparable to the best-known IB.

With the increase in Rust's popularity, various studies have begun empirically

and spectroscopy (MRS) of the hyperluminous infrared system SPT0311-58 at
z=6.9. MIRI observations are compared with existing ALMA far-infrared continuum
and [CII]158$\mu$m imaging. Even though the ALMA observations suggests very
high star formation rates (SFR) in the eastern (E) and western (W) galaxies of
the system, the H$\alpha$ line is not detected. This, together with the
detection of the Pa$\alpha$ line, implies very high optical nebular extinction
with lower limits of 4.2 (E) and 3.9 mag (W), and even larger 5.6 (E) and 10.0
(W) for SED derived values. The extinction-corrected Pa$\alpha$ SFRs are 383
and 230M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for the E and W galaxies, respectively. This
represents 50% of the SFRs derived from the [CII]158$\mu$m line and infrared
light for the E galaxy and as low as 6% for the W galaxy. The MIRI observations
reveal a clumpy stellar structure, with each clump having 3 to 5
$\times$10$^{9}$M$_\mathrm{\odot}$, leading to a total stellar mass of 2.0 and
1.5$\times$10$^{10}$M$_\mathrm{\odot}$ for the E and W galaxies, respectively.
The specific SFR in the stellar clumps ranges from 25 to 59Gyr$^{-1}$, which
are 3 to 10 times larger than the values measured in galaxies of similar mass
at redshifts 6 to 8. The overall gas mass fraction is
$M_\mathrm{gas}$/$M_*\sim3$, similar to that of z=4.5-6 star-forming galaxies.
The observed properties of SPT0311-58 such as the clumpy distribution at
sub(kpc) scales and the very high average extinction are similar to those
observed in low- and intermediate-z LIRGs and ULIRGs, even though SPT0311-58 is
observed only 800 Myr after the Big Bang. Massive, heavily obscured, clumpy
starburst systems like SPT0311-58 likely represent the early phases in the

the synergistic employment of a traditional, Adaptive Neural Network (ANN)

the standard feed-forward neural networks, can take advantage of the
dependencies in an input sequence, which can contain critical information that
can help predict uncertainty. Through a novel training method we introduced,
the LSTM network learns to compensate for the deficiencies of the ANN
controller during sudden changes in plant dynamics. This substantially improves
the transient response of the system and allows the controller to quickly react
to unexpected events. Through careful simulation studies, we demonstrate that
this architecture can improve the estimation accuracy on a diverse set of
uncertainties for an indefinite time span. We also provide an analysis of the
contributions of the ANN controller and LSTM network to the control input,
identifying their individual roles in compensating low and high-frequency error
dynamics. This analysis provides insight into why and how the LSTM augmentation
improves the system's transient response. The stability of the overall system

artificial intelligence, among many other disciplines: this paper is concerned
with their intersection. Despite their importance, a formal framework that
supports both these forms of reasoning has, until now, been lacking. We offer a
solution in the form of (structural) causal games, which can be seen as
extending Pearl's causal hierarchy to the game-theoretic domain, or as
extending Koller and Milch's multi-agent influence diagrams to the causal
domain. We then consider three key questions: i) How can the (causal)
dependencies in games - either between variables, or between strategies - be
modelled in a uniform, principled manner? ii) How may causal queries be
computed in causal games, and what assumptions does this require? iii) How do
causal games compare to existing formalisms? To address question i), we
introduce mechanised games, which encode dependencies between agents' decision
rules and the distributions governing the game. In response to question ii), we
present definitions of predictions, interventions, and counterfactuals, and
discuss the assumptions required for each. Regarding question iii), we describe
correspondences between causal games and other formalisms, and explain how
causal games can be used to answer queries that other causal or game-theoretic
models do not support. Finally, we highlight possible applications of causal
games, aided by an extensive open-source Python library.

chemical potential, and the molecular hardness. The agreement between the peaks
positions from theoretical infrared spectra compared with experimental ones for
all systems, validate the used methodology. Our findings show that for the
boron-nitride based nanobelts, the calculated properties have opposite
monotonic relationship with the size of the systems whereas, for the
carbon-based, the properties show the same monotonic relationship for both
types of nanobelts. Also, the torsion presented on the M\""obius nanobelts, in
the case of boron-nitride, induced an inhomogeneous surface distribution for
the HOMO orbitals. In all cases, the properties vary with the increase in the
size of the nanobelts indicating that it is possible to choose the desired
values by changing the size and type of the systems.

particle pairs. However, the full theoretical origin of this picture is not
fully established yet. In this work, we clarify this picture by investigating
entanglement entropy using its connection with the large-deviation theory for
thermodynamic and hydrodynamic fluctuations. We apply the universal framework
of Ballistic Fluctuation Theory (BFT), based the Euler hydrodynamics of the
model, to correlation functions of \emph{branch-point twist fields}, the
starting point for computing R\'enyi entanglement entropies within the replica
approach. Focusing on free fermionic systems in order to illustrate the ideas,
we show that both the equilibrium behavior and the dynamics of R\'enyi
entanglement entropies can be fully derived from the BFT. In particular, we
emphasise that long-range correlations develop after quantum quenches, and
accounting for these explain the structure of the entanglement growth. We
further show that this growth is related to fluctuations of charge transport,
generalising to quantum quenches the relation between charge fluctuations and
entanglement observed earlier. The general ideas we introduce suggest that the
large-scale behaviour of entanglement has its origin within hydrodynamic
fluctuations.

cutting-edge technology that could allow 20-day transit times: laser energy
driven light sails. This propulsion method uses a ground-based laser array to
propel a spacecraft attached to a light sail to high speeds, enabling missions
that are much faster than current missions. By utilizing a MATLAB model and a
laser propulsion tool, we visualize and determine optimal trajectories and
departure windows for such missions. We discuss and show that these missions
are possible during specific launch windows in a 27-month timeframe between
2030-2032, but also have practical challenges. During solar conjunction, such
missions are limited by solar proximity, but are possible during all orbital
phases if the transit time requirement is relaxed. Laser arrays capable of
generating 13 GW are necessary to enable 20-day missions with a 5 kg spacecraft
near conjunction, but only 0.55 GW is required near opposition. The spacecraft
has a hyperbolic trajectory and is not bound to the solar system during
transit. A challenge for future work involves the deceleration and entry,
descent, and landing phases. A laser array on Mars could address some of this
challenge. Spacecraft mass capabilities can be increased by optimizing the
laser array and sail properties. Multiple spacecraft may be boosted
simultaneously to carry more payload at lower costs. This work is intended to
serve as proof of concept that lightweight payloads can be transported via such
missions. Technologies enabling 20-day missions can be developed in the future

whether AI agents maximize their payoffs in a non-social decision task in which

series of dictator games in which they can share resources with a
recipient--either another AI agent, the human experimenter, or an anonymous

most-sophisticated AI agent in the study maximizes its payoffs more often than
not in the non-social decision task (it does so in 92% of all trials), and this
AI agent also exhibits the most-generous altruistic behavior in the dictator

agent's altruistic behaviors, moreover, vary by recipient: the AI agent shared
substantially less of the endowment with the human experimenter or an anonymous

consistent with self-interest and altruism in an AI agent. Moreover, our study

predominant topic mainly to address open issues in multivariate time series

parameters for specific problems. A different strategy uses complex network to
obtain an additional and reduced representation of temporal and causal
properties of the time series data. Recent strategies involve mapping
multivariate time series into high-level network structures, specifically into
multiplex networks representing interconnections between contemporary
timestamps of different time series components. In this work, we propose a new
mapping method that takes advantage of the entire structure of multilayer
networks. We introduce the multilayer horizontal visibility graph that is based
on the new concept of cross-horizontal visibility between lagged timestamps of
different components, which allows describing the cross-dimension dependencies
via inter-layer edges. We use a set of existing topological measures of
multilayer networks as well as a novel measure to evaluate and validate our
approach, which is parameter-free, does not require data pre-processing and is
applicable to any kind of multivariate time series data. We provide an
extensive experimental evaluation, where we explore the proposed topological
measures, showing that the inter-layer edges based on cross-horizontal
visibility preserve more information about the time series data after the
mappings, information that would inevitably be lost using mapping methods that
result in single-layer and multiplex structures. We also verify that the
information mapped by the inter-layer edges is not enough on its own, but that
it complements the data information captured by the commonly used intra-layer
edges.

stochastic epidemic model for a population that moves on $R^{d}$ following SDEs
driven by independent Brownian motions. We define the sequences of empirical
measures, which describe the evolution of the positions of the susceptible,
infected and removed individuals. Next, we obtain large population
approximations of those sequence of measures, as weak solution of a system of
reaction-diffusion equations. Finaly we study the fluctuations of the
stochastic model around its large population limit via the central limit
theorem. The limit is a distribution valued Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and can
be represented as the solution of system of stochastic partial differential

dream in software engineering. These tools, based on large language models, are
typically trained on massive corpora of code mined from unvetted public
sources. As a result, these models are susceptible to data poisoning attacks
where an adversary manipulates the model's training or fine-tuning phases by
injecting malicious data. Poisoning attacks could be designed to influence the
model's suggestions at run time for chosen contexts, such as inducing the model
into suggesting insecure code payloads. To achieve this, prior poisoning
attacks explicitly inject the insecure code payload into the training data,
making the poisoning data detectable by static analysis tools that can remove
such malicious data from the training set. In this work, we demonstrate two
novel data poisoning attacks, COVERT and TROJANPUZZLE, that can bypass static
analysis by planting malicious poisoning data in out-of-context regions such as
docstrings. Our most novel attack, TROJANPUZZLE, goes one step further in
generating less suspicious poisoning data by never including certain
(suspicious) parts of the payload in the poisoned data, while still inducing a
model that suggests the entire payload when completing code (i.e., outside
docstrings). This makes TROJANPUZZLE robust against signature-based
dataset-cleansing methods that identify and filter out suspicious sequences
from the training data. Our evaluation against two model sizes demonstrates
that both COVERT and TROJANPUZZLE have significant implications for how
practitioners should select code used to train or tune code-suggestion models.

tracking accuracy, path speed, and motion uniformity. Industrial robots are
programmed through motion primitives consisting of waypoints connected by
pre-defined motion segments, with specified parameters such as path speed and
blending zone. The actual executed robot motion depends on the robot joint
servo controller and joint motion constraints (velocity, acceleration, etc.)
which are largely unknown to the users. Programming a robot to achieve the
desired performance today is time-consuming and mostly manual, requiring tuning
a large number of coupled parameters in the motion primitives. The performance
also depends on the choice of additional parameters: possible redundant degrees
of freedom, location of the target curve, and the robot configuration. This
paper presents a systematic approach to optimize the robot motion primitives
for performance. The approach first selects the static parameters, then the
motion primitives, and finally iteratively update the waypoints to minimize the

speed subject to the tracking accuracy and speed uniformity constraints over
the entire path. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in

experimentally for an ABB robot. Comparing with the baseline using the current

AMD/Xilinx Versal ACAP architecture combines general-purpose CPU cores and
programmable logic with AI Engine processors optimized for AI/ML. With 400
AIEs, it provides up to 6.4 TFLOPs performance for 32-bit floating-point data.
However, machine learning models often contain both large and small MM
operations. While large MM operations can be parallelized efficiently across
many cores, small MM operations typically cannot. We observe that executing
some small MM layers from the BERT natural language processing model on a
large, monolithic MM accelerator in Versal ACAP achieved less than 5% of the
theoretical peak performance. Therefore, one key question arises: How can we
design accelerators to fully use the abundant computation resources under
limited communication bandwidth for applications with multiple MM layers of
diverse sizes? We identify the biggest system throughput bottleneck resulting
from the mismatch of massive computation resources of one monolithic
accelerator and the various MM layers of small sizes in the application. To
resolve this problem, we propose the CHARM framework to compose multiple

past few years. Existing methods mainly establish 3D representations from
multi-view images and adopt a dense detection head for object detection, or
employ object queries distributed in 3D space to localize objects. In this
paper, we design Multi-View 2D Objects guided 3D Object Detector (MV2D), which
can lift any 2D object detector to multi-view 3D object detection. Since 2D
detections can provide valuable priors for object existence, MV2D exploits 2D
detectors to generate object queries conditioned on the rich image semantics.
These dynamically generated queries help MV2D to recall objects in the field of
view and show a strong capability of localizing 3D objects. For the generated
queries, we design a sparse cross attention module to force them to focus on
the features of specific objects, which suppresses interference from noises.
The evaluation results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the dynamic object
queries and sparse feature aggregation can promote 3D detection capability.
MV2D also exhibits a state-of-the-art performance among existing methods. We
hope MV2D can serve as a new baseline for future research.

then obtained using an adaptive shooting scheme together with the multi-region

The adaptive numerical scheme in the radial direction improves considerably the
accuracy of the equilibrium solution. The decomposition with independent

magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium problem. The reduction of the matrix size is
about an order of magnitude as compared with the conventional radially

information. A popular solution is to first transform the front-viewed (FV)
images or features into the bird-eye-view (BEV) space with inverse perspective
mapping (IPM) and detect lanes from BEV features. However, the reliance of IPM
on flat ground assumption and loss of context information make it inaccurate to
restore 3D information from BEV representations. An attempt has been made to
get rid of BEV and predict 3D lanes from FV representations directly, while it
still underperforms other BEV-based methods given its lack of structured
representation for 3D lanes. In this paper, we define 3D lane anchors in the 3D

directly from FV representations. 3D lane anchors are projected to the FV
features to extract their features which contain both good structural and
context information to make accurate predictions. In addition, we also develop
a global optimization method that makes use of the equal-width property between
lanes to reduce the lateral error of predictions. Extensive experiments on
three popular 3D lane detection benchmarks show that our Anchor3DLane

for characterising the architecture of planetary systems at the system level.
There are four classes of planetary system architecture: similar, mixed,
anti-ordered, and ordered. In this paper, we investigate the formation pathways
leading to these four architecture classes. To understand the role of nature
versus nurture in sculpting the final (mass) architecture of a system, we apply
our architecture framework to synthetic planetary systems -- formed via
core-accretion -- using the Bern model. General patterns emerge in the
formation pathways of the four architecture classes. Almost all planetary
systems emerging from protoplanetary disks whose initial solid mass was less
than one Jupiter mass are similar. Systems emerging from heavier disks may
become mixed, anti-ordered, or ordered. Increasing dynamical interactions
(planet-planet, planet-disk) tends to shift a system's architecture from mixed
to anti-ordered to ordered. Our model predicts the existence of a new
metallicity-architecture correlation. Similar systems have very high occurrence
around low-metallicity stars. The occurrence of the anti-ordered and ordered
classes increases with increasing metallicity. The occurrence of mixed
architecture first increases and then decreases with increasing metallicity. In
our synthetic planetary systems, the role of nature is disentangled from the
role of nurture. Nature (or initial conditions) pre-determines whether the
architecture of a system becomes similar; otherwise nurture influences whether
a system becomes mixed, anti-ordered, or ordered. We propose the `Aryabhata
formation scenario' to explain some planetary systems which host only
water-rich worlds. We finish this paper with a discussion of future
observational and theoretical works that may support or refute the results of
this paper.

within a single planetary system. We propose that the space of planetary system
architectures be partitioned into four classes: similar, mixed, anti-ordered,
and ordered. We applied our framework to observed and synthetic multi-planetary
systems, thereby studying their architectures of mass, radius, density, core
mass, and the core water mass fraction. We explored the relationships between a
system's (mass) architecture and other properties. Our work suggests that: (a)
similar architectures are the most common outcome of planet formation; (b)
internal structure and composition of planets shows a strong link with their
system architecture; (c) most systems inherit their mass architecture from
their core mass architecture; (d) most planets that started inside the ice line
and formed in-situ are found in systems with a similar architecture; and (e)
most anti-ordered systems are expected to be rich in wet planets, while most
observed mass ordered systems are expected to have many dry planets. We find,
in good agreement with theory, that observations are generally biased towards
the discovery of systems whose density architectures are similar, mixed, or
anti-ordered. This study probes novel questions and new parameter spaces for
understanding theory and observations. Future studies may utilise our framework
to not only constrain the knowledge of individual planets, but also the
multi-faceted architecture of an entire planetary system. We also speculate on
the role of system architectures in hosting habitable worlds.

to DRL encouraging intelligent agents to sufficiently explore the environment

exploration plays a significant role in accessing an optimal policy for DRL.
Despite recent works making great progress in continuous control tasks,
exploration in these tasks has remained insufficiently investigated. To
explicitly encourage exploration in continuous control tasks, we propose CCEP
(Centralized Cooperative Exploration Policy), which utilizes underestimation
and overestimation of value functions to maintain the capacity of exploration.
CCEP first keeps two value functions initialized with different parameters, and
generates diverse policies with multiple exploration styles from a pair of
value functions. In addition, a centralized policy framework ensures that CCEP
achieves message delivery between multiple policies, furthermore contributing
to exploring the environment cooperatively. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that CCEP achieves higher exploration capacity. Empirical analysis
shows diverse exploration styles in the learned policies by CCEP, reaping
benefits in more exploration regions. And this exploration capacity of CCEP
ensures it outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods across multiple

improving its radiative quality ($Q$) factor has been considered challenging.
Here, we report the design of a hexapole mode of an H1 nanocavity with a $Q$
factor exceeding $10^8$. We achieved such extremely high-$Q$ conditions by
designing only four structural modulation parameters thanks to the ${\rm

crystal nanocavities exhibited a systematic change in their resonant

one million ($1.2 \times 10^6$ maximum). We examined the difference between the
theoretical and experimental performances by conducting a simulation of systems
with input and output waveguides and with randomly distributed radii of air
holes. Automated optimization using the same design parameters further
increased the theoretical $Q$ factor by up to $4.5 \times 10^8$, which is two

appropriate neural maps to approximate the profile of unknown physical and

training of the neural networks by minimizing the Tikhonov-regularized PDE loss

systems with predictive capabilities via multitask learning where the field
variables are modeled by neural maps endowed with (scaler or distributed)
auxiliary parameters such as physical unknowns and loss function weights. PINNs
are then trained by minimizing a measure of data misfit subject to the
underlying physical laws as constraints. In this study, to facilitate learning
from ultrasonic data, the PINNs loss adopts (a) wavenumber-dependent Sobolev
norms to compute the data misfit, and (b) non-adaptive weights in a specific
scaling framework to naturally balance the loss objectives by leveraging the
form of PDEs germane to elastic-wave propagation. Both paradigms are examined

uncertainty. The codebook is learned by self-reconstruction over real facial
motions and thus embedded with realistic facial motion priors. Over the
discrete motion space, a temporal autoregressive model is employed to
sequentially synthesize facial motions from the input speech signal, which
guarantees lip-sync as well as plausible facial expressions. We demonstrate
that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods both

$Tr_{\mathbb{F}_{p^t}/\mathbb{F}_p}(f(\epsilon)) = b$ for any prescribed $a,b

intelligent entities and the real world, with broad applications in Robotics,
especially target-driven navigation. This task requires the robot to find an
object of a certain category efficiently in an unknown domestic environment.
Recent works focus on exploiting layout relationships by graph neural networks
(GNNs). However, most of them obtain robot actions directly from observations
in an end-to-end manner via an incomplete relation graph, which is not
interpretable and reliable. We decouple this task and propose ReVoLT, a
hierarchical framework: (a) an object detection visual front-end, (b) a
high-level reasoner (infers semantic sub-goals), (c) an intermediate-level
planner (computes geometrical positions), and (d) a low-level controller
(executes actions). ReVoLT operates with a multi-layer semantic-spatial
topological graph. The reasoner uses multiform structured relations as priors,
which are obtained from combinatorial relation extraction networks composed of
unsupervised GraphSAGE, GCN, and GraphRNN-based Region Rollout. The reasoner
performs with Upper Confidence Bound for Tree (UCT) to infer semantic
sub-goals, accounting for trade-offs between exploitation (depth-first
searching) and exploration (regretting). The lightweight intermediate-level
planner generates instantaneous spatial sub-goal locations via an online
constructed Voronoi local graph. The simulation experiments demonstrate that
our framework achieves better performance in the target-driven navigation tasks
and generalizes well, which has an 80% improvement compared to the existing
state-of-the-art method. The code and result video will be released at

Additionally, identifying explainable features from these models that govern
preclinical discovery and clinical prediction is crucial for cancer diagnosis,
prognosis, and therapeutic response studies. We propose PONET- a novel
biological pathway-informed pathology-genomic deep model that integrates
pathological images and genomic data not only to improve survival prediction
but also to identify genes and pathways that cause different survival rates in
patients. Empirical results on six of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets

reveals meaningful biological interpretations. The proposed method establishes
insight into how to train biologically informed deep networks on multimodal
biomedical data which will have general applicability for understanding

further has two tightly coupled components, a traditional CNN-based U-Net and a

these two U-shaped networks to effectively support high-quality vessel
segmentation. The entire cascaded network can be trained from end to end. The
graph in the second subnetwork is constructed according to a vessel probability
map as well as appearance and semantic similarities in the original CT volume.
To tackle the challenges caused by the sparsity and anisotropy of vessels, a
higher percentage of graph nodes are distributed in areas that potentially

applications ranging from biological to large-scale industrial settings. These
fluids are often associated with various complex flow phenomena due to the
presence of non-linear elastic stresses, originating due to the stretching and
relaxation phenomena of microstructure (such as polymer molecules in the case
of a viscoelastic polymer solution) in a deformed flow field. One such
phenomenon is elastic instability (EI) which emerges due to the interaction
between elastic stresses and streamline curvature present in a flow system at
small values of the Renolds number (ratio of the inertial to that of the
viscous forces) when the Weissenberg number (ratio of the microstructure
relaxation time to that of the rate of flow deformation) exceeds a critical
value. On further increasing this Weissenberg number to higher values, the
unstable flow field caused due to this elastic instability transits to a more
chaotic and turbulent-like flow structure called elastic turbulence (ET). Over
the last two decades or so, an extensive investigation has been performed on
this particular topic in the complex fluids research community. Some excellent
articles recently present this ET phenomenon's development, understanding, and
progress in the literature. This article focuses on the application
perspectives of this phenomenon. In particular, this article aims to provide a
comprehensive review of the investigations conducted so far in the literature
to demonstrate the potential of these EI and ET phenomena in three main
application areas, namely, microfluidic mixing, microscale heat transfer, and
chemically enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process. Additionally, a detailed
discussion of the limitations and future directions of these EI and ET
phenomena from an application point of view is also presented in this article.

could become more frequent. These adverse effects of glitches can be mitigated
by estimating and subtracting them out from the data, but their unpredictable

methods that do not require auxiliary data, work for a large variety of

satisfying these requirements for broadband short-duration glitches, the type

the keys to the pervasive interaction with the Internet of Things. This paper
presents Hawkeye, a new mmWave backscatter that, for the first time, offers
over (i) hundred-scale simultaneous 3D localization at (ii) subcentimeter
accuracy for over an (iii) hectometer distance. Hawkeye generally applies to
indoors and outdoors as well as under mobility. Hawkeye tag's Van Atta Array
design with retro-reflectivity in both elevation and azimuth planes offers 3D
localization and effectively suppresses the multipath. Hawkeye localization
algorithm is a lightweight signal processing compatible with the commodity FMCW
radar. It uniquely leverages the interplay between the tag signal and clutter,
and leverages the spetral leakage for fine-grained positioning. Prototype
evaluations in corridor, lecture room, and soccer field reveal 6.7 mm median
accuracy at 160 m range, and simultaneously localizes 100 tags in only 33.2 ms.
Hawkeye is reliable under temperature change with significant oscillator
frequency offset.

pipeline for robust and accurate long-term pose estimation under challenging
conditions. The proposed method comprises four modules connected in a sequence.
First, a mapping module is applied to build accurate 3D maps of the scene, one
map for each reference sequence if there exist multiple reference sequences
under different conditions. Second, a single-image-based localization pipeline
(retrieval--matching--PnP) is performed to estimate 6-DoF camera poses for each
query image, one for each 3D map. Third, a consensus set maximization module is
proposed to filter out outlier 6-DoF camera poses, and outputs one 6-DoF camera
pose for a query. Finally, a robust pose refinement module is proposed to
optimize 6-DoF query poses, taking candidate global 6-DoF camera poses and
their corresponding global 2D-3D matches, sparse 2D-2D feature matches between
consecutive query images and SLAM poses of the query sequence as input.
Experiments on the 4seasons dataset show that our method achieves high accuracy
and robustness. In particular, our approach wins the localization challenge of

  Reduction",,,,,"cs.CR cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning has been widely used to solve various code-based tasks by
building deep code models based on a large number of code snippets. However,
deep code models are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks. As source code is
discrete and has to strictly stick to the grammar and semantics constraints,
the adversarial attack techniques in other domains are not applicable.
Moreover, the attack techniques specific to deep code models suffer from the
effectiveness issue due to the enormous attack space. In this work, we propose
a novel adversarial attack technique (i.e., CODA). Its key idea is to use the
code differences between the target input and reference inputs (that have small
code differences but different prediction results with the target one) to guide
the generation of adversarial examples. It considers both structure differences
and identifier differences to preserve the original semantics. Hence, the
attack space can be largely reduced as the one constituted by the two kinds of
code differences, and thus the attack process can be largely improved by
designing corresponding equivalent structure transformations and identifier
renaming transformations. Our experiments on 10 deep code models (i.e., two pre
trained models with five code-based tasks) demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of CODA, the naturalness of its generated examples, and its
capability of defending against attacks after adversarial fine-tuning. For
example, CODA improves the state-of-the-art techniques (i.e., CARROT and ALERT)
by 79.25% and 72.20% on average in terms of the attack success rate,
respectively.

is to understand how the choice of basis functions affects the calculations of
linear optical absorption in clusters, qualitatively, and quantitatively. For
this purpose, we have calculated linear optical absorption spectra of several
small charged and neutral clusters, namely, Li$_{2}$, Li$_{3}$, Li$_{4}$,
B$_{2}^{+}$, B$_{3}^{+}$, Be$_{2}^{+}$, and Be$_{3}^{+}$, using a variety of

on the peak locations in the absorption spectra of Li$_{3}$ and Li$_{4}$ are in
very good agreement with the experiments. Our general recommendation is that
for excited-state calculations, it is very important to utilize those basis

sets also yield high-quality results for photoabsorption spectra, and are
recommended for such calculations if the computational resources are limited.

We first calculate the gravitational wave signal of a single collision event,

calculation of the energy spectrum of the collective effect of all dark matter
collisions in the Universe. Concerning the DM halo collision rate we show that
it is given by the product of the number density of DM halos, which is
calculated by the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) theory, with the collision
rate of a single DM halo, which is given by simulation results, with a function
of the linear growth rate of matter density through cosmological evolution.
Hence, integrating over all mass and distance ranges, we finally extract the
spectrum of the stochastic gravitational wave background created by DM halos
collisions. As we show, the resulting contribution to the stochastic
gravitational wave background is of the order of $h_{c} \approx 10^{-30}$ in

The Juno spacecraft has obtained highly accurate tidal Love numbers,
which provide important constraints on the tidal response and interior
structure of Jupiter. Aims. In order to exploit these observations, it is
necessary to develop an approach for accurately calculating the tidal response
of Jupiter for a given interior model and to investigate the role of interior
structure. Methods. We directly solve the linearized tidal equations of a
compressible, self-gravitating, rotating and viscous fluid body using a
pseudo-spectral method. The Coriolis force is fully taken into account but the
centrifugal effect is neglected. We can simultaneously obtain the real and
imaginary parts of the tidal Love numbers for a given planetary interior model.
Results. We calculate the tidal responses for three simple interior models of
Jupiter which may contain a compact rigid core or an extended dilute core. All
of models we consider can explain the fractional correction $\Delta
k_{22}\approx -4\%$ due to dynamical tides, but all have difficulties to
reconcile the observed $\Delta k_{42}\approx -11\%$ for the high-degree tidal
Love number. We show that the Coriolis force significantly modifies gravity
modes in an extended dilute core at the tidal frequency relevant to the
Galilean satellites. We demonstrate that a thin stable layer in the outer
region, if exists, would also influence the tidal responses of Jupiter.

While there are numerous works into FSL task, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have
rarely been taken as the backbone to FSL with few trials focusing on naive
finetuning of whole backbone or classification layer.} Essentially, despite
ViTs have been shown to enjoy comparable or even better performance on other
vision tasks, it is still very nontrivial to efficiently finetune the ViTs in
real-world FSL scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel efficient Transformer
Tuning (eTT) method that facilitates finetuning ViTs in the FSL tasks. The key
novelties come from the newly presented Attentive Prefix Tuning (APT) and
Domain Residual Adapter (DRA) for the task and backbone tuning, individually.
Specifically, in APT, the prefix is projected to new key and value pairs that
are attached to each self-attention layer to provide the model with
task-specific information. Moreover, we design the DRA in the form of learnable
offset vectors to handle the potential domain gaps between base and novel data.
To ensure the APT would not deviate from the initial task-specific information
much, we further propose a novel prototypical regularization, which maximizes
the similarity between the projected distribution of prefix and initial
prototypes, regularizing the update procedure. Our method receives outstanding
performance on the challenging Meta-Dataset. We conduct extensive experiments

vertices $s$ and~$t$, and the task is to decide whether there is a directed
simple path from $s$ to $t$ in $G$ whose length is larger than
$\mathsf{dist}_{G}(s,t)$. The more general parameterized variant, directed long
detour, asks for a simple $s$-to-$t$ path of length at least
$\mathsf{dist}_{G}(s,t)+k$, for a given parameter $k$. Surprisingly, it is
still unknown whether directed detour is polynomial-time solvable on general
digraphs. However, for planar digraphs, Wu and Wang~[Networks, '15] proposed an
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$-time algorithm for directed detour, while Fomin et
al.~[STACS 2022] gave a $2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}\cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$-time fpt
algorithm for directed long detour. The algorithm of Wu and Wang relies on a
nontrivial analysis of how short detours may look like in a plane embedding,
while the algorithm of Fomin et al.~is based on a reduction to the
${\S}$-disjoint paths problem on planar digraphs. This latter problem is
solvable in polynomial time using the algebraic machinery of
Schrijver~[SIAM~J.~Comp.,~'94], but the degree of the obtained polynomial
factor is huge.
  In this paper we propose two simple algorithms: we show how to solve, in
planar digraphs, directed detour in time $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and directed long
detour in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}\cdot n^4 \log n$. In both cases, the idea is
to reduce to the $2$-disjoint paths problem in a planar digraph, and to observe
that the obtained instances of this problem have a certain topological
structure that makes them amenable to a direct greedy strategy.

clustering, allowing several latent class variables has been proposed. This
model assumes that the distribution of the observed data can be factorized into
several independent blocks of variables, each block following its own mixture
model. In this paper, we assume that each block follows a non parametric latent
class model, {\it i.e.} independence of the variables in each component of the
mixture with no parametric assumption on their class conditional distribution.
The purpose is to deduce, from the observation of a sample, the number of
blocks, the partition of the variables into the blocks and the number of
components in each block, which characterise the proposed model. By following
recent literature on model and variable selection in non-parametric mixture
models, we propose to discretize the data into bins. This permits to apply the
classical multi-partition clustering procedure for parametric multinomials,
which are based on a penalized likelihood method (\emph{e.g.} BIC). The
consistency of the procedure is obtained and an efficient optimization is
proposed. The performances of the model are investigated on simulated data.

(MDD) patients is essential to advance understanding of the disorder mechanisms

dimension of available neuroimaging data, the performance of existing methods
is often limited. Multi-site data could enhance the statistical power and
sample size, while they are often subject to inter-site heterogeneity and
data-sharing policies. In this paper, we propose a federated joint estimator,
NOTEARS-PFL, for simultaneous learning of multiple Bayesian networks (BNs) with
continuous optimization, to identify disease-induced alterations in MDD
patients. We incorporate information shared between sites and site-specific
information into the proposed federated learning framework to learn
personalized BN structures by introducing the group fused lasso penalty. We
develop the alternating direction method of multipliers, where in the local
update step, the neuroimaging data is processed at each local site. Then the
learned network structures are transmitted to the center for the global update.
In particular, we derive a closed-form expression for the local update step and
use the iterative proximal projection method to deal with the group fused lasso
penalty in the global update step. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
method on both synthetic and real-world multi-site rs-fMRI datasets. The
results suggest that the proposed NOTEARS-PFL yields superior effectiveness and
accuracy than the comparable methods.

applications to nanoantennas in the terahertz, infrared, and visible frequency
ranges. Its characteristic feature is selfconsistence reached due the
formulation in terms of dynamical conductance instead of ordinary used surface
conductivity. The physical model of edge effects is based on using the concept
of Dirac fermions. The surface conductance is considered as a general
susceptibility and is calculated via the Kubo approach. In contrast with
earlier models, the surface conductance becomes nonhomogeneous and nonlocal.
The spatial behavior of the surface conductance depends on the length of the
sheet and the electrochemical potential. Results of numerical simulations are
presented for lengths in the range of 2.1-800 nm and electrochemical potentials
ranging between 0.1-1.0 eV. It is shown that if the length exceeded 800 nm, our
model agrees with the classical Drude conductivity model with a relatively high
degree of accuracy. For rather short lengths, the conductance usually exhibits
spatial oscillations, which absent in conductivity and strongly affect the
properties of graphene based antennas. The period and amplitude of such spatial
oscillations, strongly depend on the electrochemical potential. The new theory
opens the way for realizing electrically controlled nanoantennas by changing
the electrochemical potential may of the gate voltage. The obtained results may

multimodal information and sparse training data, it is usually difficult to
achieve interpretability and high accuracy simultaneously for most methods. To
address this difficulty, a new model is developed in this paper, namely
Interpretable Multimodal Knowledge Graph Answer Prediction via Sequence
Modeling (IMKGA-SM). First, a multi-modal fine-grained fusion method is
proposed, and Vgg16 and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques are
adopted to effectively extract text information from images and images. Then,
the knowledge graph link prediction task is modelled as an offline
reinforcement learning Markov decision model, which is then abstracted into a
unified sequence framework. An interactive perception-based reward expectation
mechanism and a special causal masking mechanism are designed, which ""converts""
the query into an inference path. Then, an autoregressive dynamic gradient
adjustment mechanism is proposed to alleviate the insufficient problem of
multimodal optimization. Finally, two datasets are adopted for experiments, and
the popular SOTA baselines are used for comparison. The results show that the
developed IMKGA-SM achieves much better performance than SOTA baselines on
multimodal link prediction datasets of different sizes.

However, the origin of the veiling in the IR domain is not well understood. The
accretion spot alone is not enough to explain the shallow photospheric IR lines
in accreting systems, suggesting that another source is contributing to the
veiling in the NIR. The inner disk is often quoted as the additional emitting
source meant to explain the IR veiling. In this work, we aim to measure and
discuss the NIR veiling to understand its origins and variability timescale,
using a sample of 14 accreting stars observed with the CFHT/SPIRou
spectrograph, within the framework of the SPIRou Legacy Survey. We compared the
veiling measurements with accretion and inner disk diagnostics. The measured
veiling grows from the Y to the K band for most of the targets in our sample.
The IR veiling agrees with NIR emission excess obtained using photometric data.
However, we also find a linear correlation between the veiling and the
accretion properties of the system, showing that accretion contributes to the
inner disk heating and, consequently, to the inner disk emission excess. We
also show a connection between the NIR veiling and the system's inclination
with respect to our line of sight. This is probably due to the reduction of the
visible part of the inner disk edge, where the NIR emission excess is expected
to arise, as the inclination of the system increases. The NIR veiling appears
variable on a timescale of a day, showing the night-by-night dynamics of the
optical veiling variability. In the long term, the mean NIR veiling seems to be
stable for most of the targets on timescales of a month to a few years.
However, during occasional episodes of high accretion, which affect the
system's dynamic, the veiling also seems to be much more prominent at such
times, as we found in the case of the target RU Lup.

temperature, while following a square root dependency upon the equilibrium
plasma density. These results reveal an inverse proportionality between the
magnitude of the Alfv\'en speed and the period, as well as the background sound

(THP) for downlink multiuser multiple-input and multiple-output OTFS

huge equivalent channel matrix, we propose a simple implementation of THP that
does not require any matrix decomposition or inversion. Such a simple
implementation is enabled by the DD domain channel property, i.e., different
resolvable paths do not share the same delay and Doppler shifts, which makes it
possible to pre-cancel all the DD domain interference in a symbol-by-symbol
manner. We also study the achievable rate performance for the proposed scheme
by leveraging the information-theoretical equivalent models. In particular, we
show that the proposed scheme can achieve a near optimal performance in the
high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. More importantly, scaling laws for
achievable rates with respect to number of antennas and users are derived,
which indicate that the achievable rate increases logarithmically with the
number of antennas and linearly with the number of users. Our numerical results
align well with our findings and also demonstrate a significant improvement

several computational approaches based on architectural priors, regularizers

However, designing comprehensive hybrid solutions that can flexibly and

causing rebound effects, e.g., by improving efficiency, travel cost is
decreased, hence willingness-to-travel is increased. The latter would increase
overall vehicle miles traveled, which in turn might negate the benefits in
terms of energy and travel time. Our aim is to develop a holistic and rigorous

slowly, which may be caused by the angular momentum loss, and of six systems
increase slowly, which indicates that the materials may transfer from the
secondary component to the primary component. LAMOST low$-$resolution spectra

conduction was used to establish principles behind the single ear ECG signal,
and measurements of cardiac rhythms from 10 subjects were found to be in good
correspondence with simulated equivalents. Additionally, the viability of the
single ear ECG in real-world environments was determined through one hour

demonstrated that the single ear ECG resembles the Lead I signal, the most
widely used ECG signal in the identification of heart conditions such as
myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation, and was robust against
real-world measurement noise, even after prolonged measurements. This study
conclusively demonstrates that hearables can enable continuous monitoring of

inferred from lunar laser ranging (LLR), tidal dissipation in the Moon follows
an unexpected frequency dependence often interpreted as evidence for a highly
dissipative, melt-bearing layer encompassing the core-mantle boundary. Within
this, more or less standard interpretation, the basal layer's viscosity is
required to be of order $10^{15}$ to $10^{16}$ Pa s, and its outer radius is
predicted to extend to the zone of deep moonquakes. While the reconciliation of
those predictions with the mechanical properties of rocks might be challenging,
alternative lunar interior models without the basal layer are said to be unable
to fit the frequency dependence of tidal $Q$.
  The purpose of our paper is to illustrate under what conditions the
frequency-dependence of lunar tidal $Q$ can be interpreted without the need for
deep-seated partial melt. Devising a simplified lunar model, in which the
mantle is described by the Sundberg-Cooper rheology, we predict the relaxation
strength and characteristic timescale of elastically-accommodated grain
boundary sliding in the mantle that would give rise to the desired frequency
dependence. Along with developing this alternative model, we test the
traditional model with a basal partial melt; and we show that the two models
cannot be distinguished from each other by the available selenodetic
measurements. Additional insight into the nature of lunar tidal dissipation can
be gained either by measurements of higher-degree Love numbers and quality
factors or by farside lunar seismology.

telluric-corrected radial-velocity (RV) data from the CARMENES spectrograph,
amounting to a total of 262 spectroscopic observations covering almost four
years. There are additional long-period signals in the RVs, one of which we
attribute to the stellar rotation period. This is possible thanks to our
photometric analysis including new, well-sampled monitoring campaigns undergone
with the OSN and TJO facilities that supplement archival photometry (i.e., from
MEarth and SuperWASP), and this yielded an updated rotational period range of
$P_{rot}=150-170$d, with a likely value at $169.3^{+3.7}_{-3.6}$d. The stellar
activity indicators provided by the CARMENES spectra likewise demonstrate
evidence for the slow rotation period, though not as accurately due to possible
factors such as signal aliasing or spot evolution. Our detectability limits
indicate that additional planets more massive than one Earth mass with orbital
periods of less than 10 days can be ruled out, suggesting that perhaps Wolf

hypothesis or model for the process generating an observed dataset. The
original definition starts with a measure of the divergence of the dataset from
what was expected under the model, such as a sum of squares or a deviance
statistic. A P-value is then the ordinal location of the measure in a reference
distribution computed from the model and the data, and is treated as a
unit-scaled index of compatibility between the data and the model. In the other
definition, a P-value is a random variable on the unit interval whose
realizations can be compared to a cutoff alpha to generate a decision rule with
known error rates under the model and specific alternatives. It is commonly
assumed that realizations of such decision P-values always correspond to
divergence P-values. But this need not be so: Decision P-values can violate
intuitive single-sample coherence criteria where divergence P-values do not. It
is thus argued that divergence and decision P-values should be carefully
distinguished in teaching, and that divergence P-values are the relevant choice
when the analysis goal is to summarize evidence rather than implement a
decision rule.

formulation is developed that allows for the through-thickness nucleation and
growth of fracture surfaces, enabling the treatment of delamination in a
lower-dimensional model. Delamination fracture nucleation and propagation are
treated by choosing the kinematics to be composed of an absolutely continuous
part and a zone where jumps in the displacements are allowed. This assumption
allows the explicit derivation of the dimensionally-reduced elastic energy,
which shows a hierarchy of terms characterising the stored energy in the plane
element. An interpretation of the various terms of the reduced energy is shown
by means of the most straightforward paradigm of bond-based peridynamics. A
striking feature of the reduced energy is that, despite the small-displacement
assumption, there is a coupling between the membrane and bending terms.
Semi-analytical solutions for simplified settings are obtained through a
minimization procedure, and a range of nonstandard behaviours such as
\textit{distal} crack nucleation and curved crack path are captured by the
model. Finally, convergence of the proposed peridynamic reduced model to a
local elastic theory for vanishing nonlocal lengthscale is determined, giving a
local cohesive model for fracture.

a compositional gradient was present at the time of their formation in the
protosolar nebula. To explain this gradient, several studies have investigated
the radial transport of trace species and the effect of icelines on the
abundance profiles of solids and vapors formed in the disk. However, these
models only consider the presence of solids in the forms of pure condensates or
amorphous ice during the evolution of the protosolar nebula. They usually
neglect the possible crystallization and destabilization of clathrates, along
with the resulting interplay between the abundance of water and those of these
crystalline forms. This study is aimed at pushing this kind of investigation
further by considering all possible solid phases together in the protosolar
nebula: pure condensates, amorphous ice, and clathrates. To this end, we used a
one-dimensional (1D) protoplanetary disk model coupled with modules describing
the evolution of trace species in the vapor phase, as well as the dynamics of
dust and pebbles. Eleven key species are considered here, including H$_2$O, CO,
CO$_2$, CH$_4$, H$_2$S, N$_2$, NH$_3$, Ar, Kr, Xe, and PH$_3$. Two sets of
initial conditions are explored for the protosolar nebula. In a first scenario,
the disk is initially filled with icy grains in the forms of pure condensates.
In this case, we show that clathrates can crystallize and form enrichment peaks
up to about ten times the initial abundances at their crystallization lines. In
a second scenario, the volatiles were delivered to the protosolar nebula in the
forms of amorphous grains. In this case, the presence of clathrates is not
possible because there is no available crystalline water ice in their formation
region. Enrichment peaks of pure condensates also form beyond the snowline up
to about seven times the initial abundances.

explosive growth of large-scale data, which can greatly reduce storage and

Moreover, hashing based on auto-encoders aims to minimize the reconstruction

affinity graphs to learn a unified binary code, called Graph-Collaborated
Auto-Encoder Hashing for Multi-view Binary Clustering (GCAE). Specifically, we
propose a multi-view affinity graphs learning model with low-rank constraint,
which can mine the underlying geometric information from multi-view data. Then,
we design an encoder-decoder paradigm to collaborate the multiple affinity
graphs, which can learn a unified binary code effectively. Notably, we impose
the decorrelation and code balance constraints on binary codes to reduce the
quantization errors. Finally, we utilize an alternating iterative optimization
scheme to obtain the multi-view clustering results. Extensive experimental

systems that go unstable, but too few of our systems go unstable, likely due to
our demand that they remain stable during the gas disk stage to maintain

can account for the observed younger ages of 2:1 resonant systems orbiting
mature host stars. Many simulated planet pairs lock into a 2:1 resonance during
the gas disk stage, but those that are disrupted tend to be disrupted early,
within the first 10 Myr. Our results suggest that systems of giant planets
capable of carving and maintaining transitional disks are not the direct
predecessors of observed giant planets, either because the transitional disk
cavities have a different origin or another process is involved, such as
convergent migration that pack planets close together at the end of the

supporting role. The conclusion of our comprehensive resonant study of a broad
range of nanosphere lithography based metallic substrates, with covalently
attached 4-mercaptobenzoic acid monolayers used as probe (molecules
non-resonant in solution), is that this accepted understanding needs to be
revised. We present a detailed resonant SERS study of Metal-film over
nanosphere (MFON) substrates done both by scanning the laser wavelength, and by
tuning the plasmon response through the nanosphere diameter. Far and local
field properties are characterized through measures of optical reflectivity and
SERS efficiency, respectively, and are supported by numerical simulations. We
demonstrate that the SERS efficiency depends indeed on the electromagnetic
mechanism, determined by the plasmonic response of the system, but we observe
that it is also strongly defined by a chemical resonant contribution related to
a metal-to-ligand electronic transition of the covalently bound probe molecule.
Optimum amplification occurs when the plasmon modes intersect with the
ligand-to-metal chemical resonance, contributing synergically both mechanisms
together. The same general trend is observed for other nanosphere lithography
based substrates, including sphere-segment void cavities and hexagonally
ordered triangular nanoparticles, using both Ag or Au as the plasmonic metal,

a symmetric monoidal bifunctor from the bicategory of manifolds, cobordisms and
extended cobordisms, initially to the symmetric monoidal bicategory of
profunctors (enriched over vector spaces), and then to the Morita bicategory of

finite total homotopy TQFT, and its extended version, for the case when
$\boldsymbol{B}$ is the classifying space of a homotopically finite

between neutrino and antineutrino rates. There are several significant benefits
leading to large neutrino flux and high sensitivity on CP phase, including 1)
collimated and manipulable muon beams, which lead to a larger acceptance of

representations of code and play a vital role in supporting downstream
automated software engineering tasks. Most recently, code models were revealed
to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. A code model that is backdoor-attacked
can behave normally on clean examples but will produce pre-defined malicious
outputs on examples injected with triggers that activate the backdoors.
Existing backdoor attacks on code models use unstealthy and easy-to-detect
triggers. This paper aims to investigate the vulnerability of code models with
stealthy backdoor attacks. To this end, we propose AFRAIDOOR (Adversarial
Feature as Adaptive Backdoor). AFRAIDOOR achieves stealthiness by leveraging
adversarial perturbations to inject adaptive triggers into different inputs. We
evaluate AFRAIDOOR on three widely adopted code models (CodeBERT, PLBART and
CodeT5) and two downstream tasks (code summarization and method name
prediction). We find that around 85% of adaptive triggers in AFRAIDOOR bypass
the detection in the defense process. By contrast, only less than 12% of the
triggers from previous work bypass the defense. When the defense method is not
applied, both AFRAIDOOR and baselines have almost perfect attack success rates.
However, once a defense is applied, the success rates of baselines decrease
dramatically to 10.47% and 12.06%, while the success rate of AFRAIDOOR are
77.05% and 92.98% on the two tasks. Our finding exposes security weaknesses in
code models under stealthy backdoor attacks and shows that the state-of-the-art
defense method cannot provide sufficient protection. We call for more research

use of the analytical expression of the orbit, we estimate the Yukawa strength
$\alpha$, and find it larger than the nominal value ($10^{-8}$) adopted in
previous studies, in that it is of order ($\alpha = 10^{-4}-10^{-5}$) for
terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, earth, Mars and Pluto) whereas it is even
larger ($\alpha = 10^{-3}$) for the Giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune). Taking as inputs ($r_{min}, v_{max}, e$) observed by NASA, we analyze
the orbits analytically and numerically for both the estimated and nominal
values of $\alpha$, and determine the corresponding trajectories. For each
obtained orbit we recalculate the characterizing parameters ($r_{min}, r_{max},
a, b, e $) and compare their values according to the used potential (Newton
with/without Yukawa correction) and to the method used (analytical and/or

correction on the path due to Yukawa correction is of order of and up to 80

scenario that produces a different desirable outcome. For example, if a student
is predicted to fail a course, then counterfactual explanations can provide the
student with alternate ways so that they would be predicted to pass. The
applications are many. However, CEs are currently generated from machine
learning models that do not necessarily take into account the true causal

of computing counterfactuals which has thus far, surprisingly, not been seen in
the counterfactual explanation (CE) literature. I furthermore evaluate these
CEs on three different causal structures to show how the true underlying causal
structure affects the CEs that are generated. This study presented a method of
evaluating CEs using Pearl's method and it showed, (although using a limited

Pearl's method. This shows that we cannot simply trust CEs and it is vital for
us to know the true causal structure before we blindly compute counterfactuals

can be described by the Aslamazov$-$Larkin and Maki$-$Thompson fluctuation
theories, demonstrating a 3D$-$2D crossover with increasing temperature. The
crossover temperature $T_0$ was used to determine the coherence length along
the $c$-axis, $\xi_c(0)$=2.82 A. At the inter-mediate stage of annealing, an
anomalous increase in 2D FLC was revealed, which is associated with the
influence of uncompensated magnetic moments in $HoBa_2Cu_3O_{7-\delta}$
(HoBCO): $\mu_{eff, Ho}$=9.7$\mu_{B}$. For the quenched sample S1, the
temperature dependence of the PG has a shape typical of single crystals with a
large number of defects. However, $\Delta^*(T)$ has two small additional maxima
at high temperature, which is a feature of HoBCO single crystals with
pronounced twins and indicates the two-phase nature of the sample. Upon
annealing, the shape of $\Delta^*(T)$ noticeably changes, very likely due to an
increase in the magnetic interaction (sample S2). More important is the change
in the slope of the data at high temperatures, which has become about 3.5 times
steeper. The ordering of the oxygen distribution due to the diffusion process
during annealing somewhat compensates for the influence of magnetic
interaction. Interestingly, the slope turns out to be the same as for
FeAs-based superconductors, suggesting the possibility of the existence of spin
density waves in HoBCO in the PG state.

the prime candidates that can keep the solar corona hot at its multi-million
Kelvin temperature. Individual nanoflares are difficult to detect with the
current generation instruments; however, their presence can be inferred through
indirect techniques such as a Differential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis.
Here we employ this technique to investigate the possibility of nanoflare
heating of the quiet corona during the minimum of solar cycle 24. During this
minimum, active regions (ARs) were absent on the solar-disk for extended
periods. In the absence of ARs, X-ray bright points (XBP) are the dominant
contributor to disk-integrated X-rays. We estimate the DEM of the XBPs using
observations from the Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM) onboard the Chandrayaan-2
orbiter and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamic
Observatory. XBPs consist of small-scale loops associated with bipolar magnetic
fields. We simulate such XBP loops using the EBTEL hydrodynamic code. The
lengths and magnetic field strengths of these loops are obtained through a
potential field extrapolation of the photospheric magnetogram. Each loop is
assumed to be heated by random nanoflares having an energy that depends on the
loop properties. The composite nanoflare energy distribution for all the loops
has a power-law slope close to -2.5. The simulation output is then used to
obtain the integrated DEM. It agrees remarkably well with the observed DEM at
temperatures above 1 MK, suggesting that the nanoflare distribution, as
predicted by our model, can explain the XBP heating.

the sentiment of the sarcastic text which is one of the main challenges of
sentiment analysis. This paper tackles this challenge by introducing a novel
system (SAIDS) that predicts the sentiment, sarcasm and dialect of Arabic
tweets. SAIDS uses its prediction of sarcasm and dialect as known information
to predict the sentiment. It uses MARBERT as a language model to generate
sentence embedding, then passes it to the sarcasm and dialect models, and then
the outputs of the three models are concatenated and passed to the sentiment
analysis model. Multiple system design setups were experimented with and
reported. SAIDS was applied to the ArSarcasm-v2 dataset where it outperforms
the state-of-the-art model for the sentiment analysis task. By training all
tasks together, SAIDS achieves results of 75.98 FPN, 59.09 F1-score and 71.13

give rise to intriguing hybrid excitons that combine the advantages of the
Wannier-Mott and Frenkel excitons simultaneously. Unlike the 2D inorganic
heterostructures that suffer from moment mismatch, the hybrid excitons formed
at the organic-inorganic interface have a momentum-direct nature, which have
yet to be explored. Here, we report hybrid excitons at the copper
phthalocyanine/molybdenum diselenide (CuPc/MoSe2) interface with strong
molecular orientation dependence using low-temperature photoluminescence
spectroscopy. The new emission peaks observed in the CuPc/MoSe2 heterostructure
indicate the formation of interfacial hybrid excitons. The density functional
theory (DFT) calculation confirms the strong hybridization between the lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of CuPc and the conduction band minimum
(CBM) of MoSe2, suggesting that the hybrid excitons consist of electrons
extended in both layers and holes confined in individual layers. The
temperature-dependent measurements show that the hybrid excitons can gain the
signatures of the Frenkel excitons of CuPc and the Wannier-Mott excitons of
MoSe2 simultaneously. The out-of-plane molecular orientation is used to tailor
the interfacial hybrid exciton states. Our results reveal the hybrid excitons
at the CuPc/MoSe2 interface with tunability by molecular orientation, which
suggests that the emerging organic-inorganic heterostructure can be a promising

interpret the effectiveness of the style and content layers at the attention

We can tradeoff the model performance and convergence by dynamically varying
the proportion of augmented samples in the majority and minority classes. We

appropriate tools for such a purpose. These ultrashort bursts of light are
generated when a strong laser field interacts with matter and high-order
harmonics of the driving source are produced. In this work, we propose a way to
twist attosecond pulse trains. In our scheme, each of the attosecond pulses in
the train has a well-defined linear polarization, but with a different
polarization angle between them. To achieve this goal, we consider an infrared
pulse with a particular polarization state, called amplitude polarization. This
kind of pulse was experimentally synthesized in previous works. Our twisted
attosecond pulse train is then obtained by nonlinear driving an atomic system
with that laser source, through the high-order harmonics generation phenomenon.
We reach a high degree of control in the polarization of the ultrashort
coherent XUV-generated radiation. Through quantum mechanical simulations,
supplemented with signal processing tools, we are able to dissect the
underlying physics of the generation process. We are confident these

patients with chronic type B aortic dissection (cTBAD), which may lead to a
delayed rupture and create a life-threatening condition. However, our
understanding of such aortic expansion in cTBAD remains weak. In the present
paper, we propose to use numerical simulations to study the role of growth and
remodeling (G\&R) in aneurysmal dilatation after cTBAD. We set up a 3D
finite-element model of G\&R for aortic dissection within an open-source code.
Constitutive equations, momentum balance equations, and equations related to
the mechanobiology of the artery were formulated based on the homogenized
constrained mixture theory. The model was first applied to idealized aortic
geometries with cylindrical and toric shapes to demonstrate its feasibility and
efficiency. The model was then applied to a patient-specific aortic segment to
show its potential in more relevant and complex patient-specific clinical
applications. It was found that the G\&R tends to naturally trigger the
aneurysmal dilatation after dissection, in order to restore its tensional
equilibrium. Our results indicated that the value of the gain parameter,
related to collagen G\&R, plays an important role in the stability of aortic
expansion after cTBAD. A small gain parameter will induce an excessive
aneurysmal degeneration whilst a large gain parameter helps to recover a
stabilized state of the artery after dissection. Finally, it was found that
other mechanobiology-related parameters, such as the circumferential length of
the dissection, as well as the pressure in the false lumen, may also be
determinant for the stability of aneurysmal dilatation after cTBAD. Both a wide
tear and an elevated false lumen pressure favor an unstable development of
aortic expansion after cTBAD. As future work, the present model will be
validated through predictions of aneurysmal dilatation in patient-specific
clinical cases, in comparison with datasets followed over a significant period
of time.

their correlations with each other. In the following, both linear and deep
learning approaches are used to attack these PUF simulations and
comprehensively investigate the impact of different factors on the datasets in

between the two attack methods in terms of their performance are highlighted

synchrotrons, we probe the atomic motion and structure in a metallic glass
under hydrostatic compression, from the onset of the perturbation up to a
severely-compressed state. While the structure indicates reversible
densification under compression, the dynamic is dramatically accelerated and
exhibits a hysteresis with two regimes. At low pressures, the atomic motion is
heterogeneous with avalanche-like rearrangements suggesting rejuvenation, while
under further compression, aging leads to a super-diffusive dynamics triggered
by internal stresses inherent to the glass. These results highlight the
complexity of the atomic motion in non-ergodic systems and support a theory

this work, we address these problems by presenting Language-Informed Latent
Actions with Corrections (LILAC), a framework for incorporating and adapting to
natural language corrections - ""to the right,"" or ""no, towards the book"" -
online, during execution. We explore rich manipulation domains within a shared
autonomy paradigm. Instead of discrete turn-taking between a human and robot,
LILAC splits agency between the human and robot: language is an input to a
learned model that produces a meaningful, low-dimensional control space that
the human can use to guide the robot. Each real-time correction refines the
human's control space, enabling precise, extended behaviors - with the added
benefit of requiring only a handful of demonstrations to learn. We evaluate our
approach via a user study where users work with a Franka Emika Panda
manipulator to complete complex manipulation tasks. Compared to existing
learned baselines covering both open-loop instruction following and single-turn
shared autonomy, we show that our corrections-aware approach obtains higher
task completion rates, and is subjectively preferred by users because of its
reliability, precision, and ease of use.

the cost is quadratic to the perception range, making them hardly scale up to
the long-range settings. To enable efficient long-range detection, we first
propose a fully sparse object detector termed FSD. FSD is built upon the
general sparse voxel encoder and a novel sparse instance recognition (SIR)
module. SIR groups the points into instances and applies highly-efficient
instance-wise feature extraction. The instance-wise grouping sidesteps the
issue of the center feature missing, which hinders the design of the fully
sparse architecture. To further enjoy the benefit of fully sparse
characteristic, we leverage temporal information to remove data redundancy and
propose a super sparse detector named FSD++. FSD++ first generates residual
points, which indicate the point changes between consecutive frames. The
residual points, along with a few previous foreground points, form the super
sparse input data, greatly reducing data redundancy and computational overhead.

first JWST transmission spectrum of the hot Saturn-mass exoplanet, WASP-39 b,
obtained with the NIRSpec instrument in the 3-5 $\mu$m range to investigate (a)
what atmospheric constraints are possible with JWST-quality data in this
spectral range, (b) requirements for atmospheric models used in retrievals, (c)
effect of differences between data reduction pipelines on retrieved atmospheric
properties, and (d) complementarity between JWST data in the 3-5 $\mu$m range
and HST observations at shorter wavelengths. JWST spectra in the 3-5 $\mu$m
range provide a promising avenue for chemical detections while encompassing a
window in cloud opacity for several prominent aerosols. We confirm recent
inferences of CO$_2$, SO$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO in WASP-39 b, report tentative
evidence for H$_2$S, and retrieve elemental abundances consistent with Saturn's
metallicity. We retrieve molecular abundances with $\sim$0.3-0.6 dex precision
with this relatively limited spectral range. When considering the 3-5 $\mu$m
data alone, reported differences in spectra with different reduction pipelines
can affect abundance estimates by up to $\sim$1 dex and the detectability of
less prominent species. Complementing with data at shorter wavelengths, e.g.
with other JWST instruments or HST WFC3 ($\sim$0.8-1.7 $\mu$m), can
significantly improve the accuracy and precision of the abundance estimates.
The high data quality enables constraints on aerosol properties, including
their composition, modal size and extent, motivating their consideration in
retrievals. Our results highlight the promise of JWST exoplanet spectroscopy,
while underscoring the importance of robust data reduction and atmospheric
retrieval approaches in the JWST era.

particle cache permitting particles to move from one runner to another inthe
background while particle propagation goes on. This also enables the number
ofrunners to vary during the execution either in reaction to failures and
restarts, orto adapt to changing resource availability dictated by external

possible are the annealing models, which capture the annealing kinetics of
fission tracks for isothermal heating experiments, and the Principle of
Equivalent Time (PET), which allows the application of the annealing models to
variable temperatures. It turns out that the PET only applies to specific types
of annealing models describing single activation energy annealing mechanisms
(parallel models). However, the PET has been extensively applied to models
related to multiple activation energy mechanisms (fanning models). This
procedure is an approximation that has been overlooked due to the lack of a
suitable alternative. To deal with this difficult, a formalism, based on
physicochemical techniques, that allows to quantify the effects of annealing on
the fission tracks for variable temperatures, is developed. It is independent
of the annealing mechanism and, therefore, is applicable to any annealing
model. In the cases in which the PET is valid, parallel models, the proposed
method and the PET predict the same degrees of annealing. However, deviations
appear when the methods are applied to the fanning models, with the PET
underestimating annealing effects. The consequences for the inference of
thermal histories are discussed.

  Event-Relation Prediction","CVPRW 23, Learning with Limited Labelled Data",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding event relationships in videos requires a model to understand
the underlying structures of events (i.e. the event type, the associated
argument roles, and corresponding entities) and factual knowledge for
reasoning. Structural symbolic representation (SSR) based methods directly take
event types and associated argument roles/entities as inputs to perform
reasoning. However, the state-of-the-art video event-relation prediction system
shows the necessity of using continuous feature vectors from input videos;
existing methods based solely on SSR inputs fail completely, even when given
oracle event types and argument roles. In this paper, we conduct an extensive
empirical analysis to answer the following questions: 1) why SSR-based method
failed; 2) how to understand the evaluation setting of video event relation
prediction properly; 3) how to uncover the potential of SSR-based methods. We
first identify suboptimal training settings as causing the failure of previous
SSR-based video event prediction models. Then through qualitative and
quantitative analysis, we show how evaluation that takes only video as inputs
is currently unfeasible, as well as the reliance on oracle event information to
obtain an accurate evaluation. Based on these findings, we propose to further
contextualize the SSR-based model to an Event-Sequence Model and equip it with
more factual knowledge through a simple yet effective way of reformulating
external visual commonsense knowledge bases into an event-relation prediction
pretraining dataset. The resultant new state-of-the-art model eventually
establishes a 25% Macro-accuracy performance boost.

binary structures. This binary bias, seen in the ubiquity of pair-wise networks
and formal operations of two arguments in mathematical models, limits our
capacity to faithfully capture irreducible polyadic interactions in
higher-order systems. A paradigmatic example of a higher-order interaction is
the Borromean link of three interlocking rings. In this paper we propose a
mathematical framework via hypergraphs and hypermatrix algebras that allows to
formalize such forms of higher-order bonding and connectivity in a parsimonious
way. Our framework builds on and extends current techniques in higher-order
networks -- still mostly rooted in binary structures such as adjacency matrices
-- and incorporates recent developments in higher-arity structures to
articulate the compositional behavior of adjacency hypermatrices. Irreducible
higher-order interactions turn out to be a widespread occurrence across natural
sciences and socio-cultural knowledge representation. We demonstrate this by
reviewing recent results in computer science, physics, chemistry, biology,
ecology, social science, and cultural analysis through the conceptual lens of
irreducible higher-order interactions. We further speculate that the general
phenomenon of emergence in complex systems may be characterized by
spatio-temporal discrepancies of interaction arity.

feature interaction depth selection. The AdaEnsemble can adaptively choose the
feature interaction depth and find the corresponding SparseMoE stacking layer
to exit and compute prediction from. Therefore, our proposed architecture
inherits the advantages of the exponential combinations of sparsely gated
experts within SparseMoE layers and further dynamically selects the optimal
feature interaction depth without executing deeper layers. We implement the

questions concerning the diffuse-interface VISMs remain open: (1) What is the

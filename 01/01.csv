morphisms, form classical symmetries of Yang-Mills fields in four complex
dimensions. These maps generalize conformal transformations, and admit a
nonlocal pullback connection that preserves the equations of the theory. First
it is shown that self-dual morphisms form symmetries of the anti-self-dual
Yang-Mills equations under this pullback. Then a supersymmetric generalization
of causal morphisms is defined, which preserves solutions of the field
equations for N=3 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. As a special case, this
implies that a modified definition of causal morphisms form symmetries for the
ordinary Yang-Mills field equations.

suitable ""seen classes"" for training ZSL models. DiRaC-I has two main goals -
constructing a diversified set of seed classes, followed by a visual-semantic
mining algorithm initialized by these seed classes that acquires the classes
capturing both diversity and rarity in the object domain adequately. These
classes can then be used as ""seen classes"" to train ZSL models for image
classification. We adopt a real-world scenario where novel object classes are
available to neither DiRaC-I nor the ZSL models during training and conducted
extensive experiments on two benchmark data sets for zero-shot image
classification - CUB and SUN. Our results demonstrate DiRaC-I helps ZSL models
to achieve significant classification accuracy improvements.

quantum world. The course is based on a coordinated application of an analysis
of conceptual change in the learning of a successive theory, of a framework
describing the epistemic practices of theoretical physicists, and of a careful
approach to interpretive themes. We show how they drive the derivation of the
design principles, how these principles guide the development of the
instructional sequence and of its strategies, how their implementation requires
the blending of different research perspectives and learning systems. The first
challenge is addressed through a path of revision of classical concepts and
constructs which leverages student resources according to the trajectory of
each notion. The second by adopting a framework that promotes the construction
of a unifying picture of quantum measurement across contexts. The third by
designing the course around a modeling process that engages students in
epistemic practices of the theoretical physicist, such as generating and/or
running thought experiments, and mathematical modelling in a purely theoretical
setting. All is aimed to help students accept the quantum description of the
world as a plausible product of their own inquiry. This process is assisted by
the discussion of the facets of the foundational debate that are triggered by

vanishing regret compared to the optimal policy -- and show that for large

Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ can be lower
bounded by the distortion of (possibly discontinuous) functions between them.
The more these functions must distort the metrics, the larger the
Gromov-Hausdorff distance must be. Topology has few tools to obstruct the
existence of discontinuous functions. However, an arbitrary function $f\colon
X\to Y$ induces a continuous map between their Vietoris-Rips simplicial
complexes, where the allowable choices of scale parameters depend on how much
the function $f$ distorts distances. We can then use equivariant topology to
obstruct the existence of certain continuous maps between Vietoris-Rips
complexes. With these ideas we bound how discontinuous an odd map between

  heat baths: instability, squeezing and driving","35 pages, 12 figures",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Entanglement being a foundational cornerstone of quantum sciences and the
primary resource in quantum information processing, understanding its dynamical
evolution in realistic conditions is essential. Unfortunately, numerous model
studies show that degradation of entanglement from a quantum system's
environment, especially thermal noise, is almost unavoidable. Thus the
appellation `hot entanglement' appears like a contradiction, until Galve et al
[Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{105} 180501 (2010)] announced that entanglement can
be kept at high temperatures if one considers a quantum system with
time-dependent coupling between the two parties, each interacting with its
individual bath. With the goal of understanding the sustenance of entanglement
at high temperatures, working with the same model and set up as Galve et al,
namely, parametrically-driven coupled harmonic oscillators interacting with
their own Markovian baths, this work probes into the feasibility of `hot
entanglement' from three aspects listed in the subtitle. Our findings show that
1) hot entanglement functions only in the unstable regimes, 2) instability is a
necessary but not sufficient condition, and 3) the power intake required by the
drive operating in the unstable regime to sustain entanglement increases
exponentially. The last factor indicates that hot entanglement under this
modeling is theoretically untenable and its actual implementation likely
unattainable.

spherical regions to setups without full Lorentz symmetry, and we study the
associated entanglement entropies holographically. We find a tight interplay
between the topology and geometry of the compact space and the evolution of the
entanglement entropy, with universal transitions from `cap' through `bridge'

black holes (BHs) is suppressed due to direct capture of stars by the event

the promise of probing the spin distribution of dormant BHs at the centers of
galaxies. By extending the frozen-in approximation commonly used in the
Newtonian limit, we propose a general relativistic criterion for the tidal
disruption of a star of given interior structure. The rate suppression factor
is then calculated for different BH masses, spins, and realistic stellar
populations. We find that either a high BH spin (> 0.5) or a young stellar
population (< 1 Gyr) allows TDEs to be observed from BHs significantly more
massive than 10^8 solar masses. We call this spin-age degeneracy (SAD). This
limits our utility of the TDE rate to constrain the BH spin distribution,
unless additional constraints on the age of the stellar population or the mass
of the disrupted star can be obtained by modeling the TDE radiation or the
stellar spectral energy distribution near the galactic nuclei.

is formalized by the notion of generalized self-concordance which originated

its generalization, the first and third authors of this paper introduced a
construction of the hypoplactic monoid by identifying vertices in a
quasi-crystal graph derived from the crystal graph associated to the general
linear Lie algebra. Although this construction is based on Kashiwara's work, it
cannot be extended to other crystal graphs, since the analogous quasi-Kashiwara
operators on words do not admit a recursive definition. This paper addresses
these issues. A general notion of quasi-crystal is introduced, followed by a
study of its properties and relation with crystals. A combinatorial study of
quasi-crystals is then made by associating a quasi-crystal graph to each
quasi-crystal, which for the class of seminormal quasi-crystals results in a
one-to-one correspondence. To model the binary operation of the hypoplactic
monoid by quasi-crystals, a notion of quasi-tensor product of quasi-crystals is
introduced, along with a combinatorial way of computing it similar to the
signature rule for the tensor product of crystals. This framework allows the
generalization of the classical hypoplactic monoid to a family of hypoplactic
monoids associated to the various simple Lie algebras. The quasi-crystal
structure is then used to establish algebraic properties of the hypoplactic
monoid associated to the symplectic Lie algebra.

eavesdroppers. In contrast to the existing works, we investigate the impact of
the RIS phase shift errors on the secrecy performance. Taking into account the
complex environment, where a general Rician channel model is adopted for all
the communication links, closed-form approximate expressions for the ergodic
secrecy rate are derived for three RIS configurations, namely, i) passive RIS,
ii) active RIS, iii) active RIS with energy harvesting (EH RIS). Then, based on
the derived expressions, we optimize the phase shifts at the RIS to enhance the
system performance. In addition, the best RIS configuration selection is
considered for a given target secrecy rate and amount of the power available at
the users. Finally, Monte-Carlo simulations are provided to verify the accuracy
of the analysis, and the impact of different system parameters on the secrecy
performance is investigated. The results in this paper show that, an active RIS
scheme can be implemented to enhance the secrecy performance of RIS-aided
communication systems with phase shift errors, especially when the users have
limited transmission power.

  Density-Weighted Average Derivative Estimators",,,,,"econ.EM math.ST stat.ME stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The density weighted average derivative (DWAD) of a regression function is a
canonical parameter of interest in economics. Classical first-order large
sample distribution theory for kernel-based DWAD estimators relies on tuning
parameter restrictions and model assumptions leading to an asymptotic linear
representation of the point estimator. Such conditions can be restrictive, and
the resulting distributional approximation may not be representative of the
underlying sampling distribution of the statistic of interest, in particular
not being robust to bandwidth choices. Small bandwidth asymptotics offers an
alternative, more general distributional approximation for kernel-based DWAD
estimators that allows for, but does not require, asymptotic linearity. The
resulting inference procedures based on small bandwidth asymptotics were found
to exhibit superior finite sample performance in simulations, but no formal
theory justifying that empirical success is available in the literature.
Employing Edgeworth expansions, this paper shows that small bandwidth
asymptotics lead to inference procedures with demonstrable superior
higher-order distributional properties relative to procedures based on
asymptotic linear approximations.

complexity} of a graph. A path is \emph{isometric} if it is a shortest path
between its endpoints. A set $S$ of isometric paths of a graph $G$ is
``$v$-rooted'', where $v$ is a vertex of $G$, if $v$ is one of the end-vertices
of all the isometric paths in $S$. The \emph{isometric path complexity} of a
graph $G$, denoted by $ipco(G)$, is the minimum integer $k$ such that there
exists a vertex $v\in V(G)$ satisfying the following property: the vertices of
any isometric path $P$ of $G$ can be covered by $k$ many $v$-rooted isometric
paths.
  First, we provide an $O(n^2 m)$-time algorithm to compute the isometric path
complexity of a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Then we show that the
isometric path complexity remains bounded for graphs in three seemingly
unrelated graph classes, namely, \emph{hyperbolic graphs}, \emph{(theta, prism,
pyramid)-free graphs}, and \emph{outerstring graphs}. Hyperbolic graphs are
extensively studied in \emph{Metric Graph Theory}. The class of (theta, prism,
pyramid)-free graphs are extensively studied in \emph{Structural Graph Theory},
\textit{e.g.} in the context of the \emph{Strong Perfect Graph Theorem}. The
class of outerstring graphs is studied in \emph{Geometric Graph Theory} and
\emph{Computational Geometry}. Our results also show that the distance
functions of these (structurally) different graph classes are more similar than
previously thought.
  Finally, we apply this new concept to the ISOMETRIC PATH COVER problem, whose
objective is to cover all vertices of a graph with a minimum number of
isometric paths, to all the above graph classes. Indeed, we show that if the
isometric path complexity of a graph $G$ is bounded by a constant, then there
exists a polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithm for ISOMETRIC
PATH COVER.

theory and many-body techniques, we perform numerical simulations for an
effective model for which all the parameters, including the Coulomb tensor, are

many-body mechanism, akin to a Mott metal-to-insulator transition. The nature
of the splitting, and thus of the resulting gap, as well as the spatial

either core accretion or disk instability will be subject to dynamical
interactions with massive spiral arms, possibly resulting in inward or outward
orbital migration, mergers with each other, or even outright ejection from the
protoplanetary system. The latter process has been hypothesized as a possible
formation scenario for the unexpectedly high frequency of unbound gas giant
exoplanets (free floating planets, FFP). Previous calculations with the EDTONS
fixed grid three dimensional (3D) hydrodynamics code found that protoplanets
with masses from 0.01 $M_\oplus$ to 3 $M_{Jup}$ could undergo chaotic orbital
evolutions in MGU disks for $\sim$ 1000 yrs without undergoing monotonic inward
or outward migration. Here the Enzo 2.5 adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) 3D
hydrodynamics code is used to follow the formation and orbital evolution of
protoplanets in MGU disks for up to 2000 yrs. The Enzo results confirm the
basic disk fragmentation results of the EDTONS code, as well as the absence of
monotonic inward or outward orbital migration. In addition, Enzo allows
protoplanet mergers to occur, unlike EDTONS, resulting in a significant
decrease in the number of protoplanets that survive for 1000 to 2000 yrs in the
Enzo models. These models also imply that gas giants should be ejected
frequently in MGU disks that fragment into large numbers of protoplanets,
supporting ejection as a possible source mechanism for the observed FFPs.

the free scalar theory can be expressed as an infinite sum of theories living

show that their modular Hamiltonian in an interval attached to the origin is,
in turn, the one obtained from the dimensional reduction of the modular
Hamiltonian of the conformal parent theory in a sphere. Remarkably, this is a
local expression in the energy density, as happens in the conformal case,
although the resulting one dimensional theories are clearly not conformal. We
support this result by analyzing the symmetries of these theories, which turn
out to be a portion of the original conformal group, and proving that the
reduced modular Hamiltonian is in fact the operator generating the modular flow
in the interval. By studying the spectrum of these modular Hamiltonians, we
also provide an analytic expression for the associated entanglement entropy.

Srednicki, we sum over the angular modes to successfully recover the conformal
anomaly in the entropy logarithmic coefficient in even dimensions, as well as

patient status from large, complex data streams, leveraging both a data-driven
approach, and use clinical knowledge to validate results. Data were collected
from a clinical trial enrolling chronic pain patients, and included
questionnaires, voice recordings, actigraphy, and standard health assessments.
The data were reduced using a clustering analysis. In an initial exploratory
analysis with only questionnaire data, we found up to 3 stable cluster
solutions that grouped symptoms on a positive to negative spectrum. Objective
features (actigraphy, speech) expanded the cluster solution granularity. Using
a 5 state solution with questionnaire and actigraphy data, we found significant
correlations between cluster properties and assessments of disability and
quality-of-life. The correlation coefficient values showed an ordinal
distinction, confirming the cluster ranking on a negative to positive spectrum.
This suggests we captured novel, distinct Pain Patient States with this
approach, even when multiple clusters were equated on pain magnitude. Relative
to using complex time courses of many variables, Pain Patient States holds
promise as an interpretable, useful, and actionable metric for a clinician or
caregiver to simplify and provide timely delivery of care.

quantization type in the modeling of Laser propagation through turbulent media.
In some of the typical physical contexts the problem reduces to stochastic
Schrodinger equation with space-time white noise of Gaussian, Poisson and Levy
type. We identify their mathematical resolution via stochastic quantization.
Nonlinear phenomena such as Kerr effect can be modeled by stochastic nonlinear
Schrodinger equation in the focusing case with space-time white noise. A
treatment of stochastic transport equation, the Korteweg-de Vries Equation as
well as a number of other nonlinear wave equations with space-time white noise
is also given. Main technique is the S-transform (we will actually use closely
related Hermite transform) which converts the stochastic partial differential
equation with space time white noise to a deterministic partial differential
equation defined on the Hida-Kondratiev white noise distribution space. We then
utlize the inverse S-transform/Hermite transform known as the characterization
theorem combined with the infinite dimensional implicit function theorem for
analytic maps to establish local existence and uniqueness theorems for pathwise
solutions of these class of problems. The particular focus of this paper on
singular white noise distributions is motivated by practical situations where
the refractive index fluctuations in propagation medium in space and time are
intense due to turbulence, ionospheric plasma turbulence, marine-layer
fluctuations, etc. Since a large class of partial differential equations that
arise in nonlinear wave propagation have polynomial type nonlinearities, white
noise distribution theory is an effective tool in studying these problems
subject to different types of white noises.

initialization from global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) in challenging

reception make it difficult for GNSS users. Steering local codes in GNSS
basebands is a desiring way to correct instantaneous signal phase misalignment,
efficiently gathering useful signal power and increasing positioning accuracy.
Besides, inertial navigation systems (INSs) have been used as a
well-complementary dead reckoning (DR) sensor for GNSS receivers in kinematic
scenarios resisting various interferences since early. But little work focuses
on the case of whether the INS can improve GNSS receivers in static scenarios.
Thus, this paper proposes an enhanced navigation system deeply integrated with
low-cost INS solutions and GNSS high-accuracy carrier-based positioning. First,
an absolute code phase is predicted from base station information, and
integrated solution of the INS DR and real-time kinematic (RTK) results through
an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, a numerically controlled oscillator
(NCO) leverages the predicted code phase to improve the alignment between
instantaneous local code phases and received ones. The proposed algorithm is
realized in a vector-tracking GNSS software-defined radio (SDR). Real-world

which reduce the thermal conductivity of TBG. The thermal magic angle arises
from the competition between the delocalization of atomic vibrational

backward-differential-flow-like algorithm which starts from the minimum of

convexification approach through Gaussian filtering, which is actually an
accumulation version of Steklov's regularization. We generalize the fingerprint
theory which was proposed in the theory of computer vision by A.L. Yuille and
T. Poggio in 1980s, in particular their fingerprint trajectory equation, to
characterize the evolution of minimizers across the scale. On the other hand,
we propose the ""seesaw"" polynomials $p(x|s)$ and we find a seesaw differential
equation $\frac{\partial p(x|s)}{\,ds}=-\frac{1}{p''(x)}$ to characterize the
evolution of global minimizer $x^*(s)$ of $p(x|s)$ while varying $s$.
Essentially, both the fingerprints $\mathcal{FP}_2$ and $\mathcal{FP}_3$ of
$p(x)$, consisting of the zeros of $\frac{\partial^2 p(x,t)}{\partial x^2}$ and
$\frac{\partial^3 p(x,t)}{\partial x^3}$, respectively, are independent of
seesaw coefficient $s$, upon which we define the Confinement Zone and Escape
Zone. Meanwhile, varying $s$ will monotonically condition the location of
global minimizer of $p(x|s)$, and all these location form the Attainable Zone.
Based on these concepts, we prove that the global minimizer $x^*$ of $p(x)$ can
be inversely evolved from the global minimizer of its convexification
polynomial $p(x,t_0)$ if and only if $x^*$ is included in the Escape Zone. In

via gradient descent in the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime, where the
networks' biases are initialized to some constant rather than zero. The
tantalizing benefit of such initialization is that the neural network will
provably have sparse activation through the entire training process, which
enables fast training procedures. The first set of results characterizes the
convergence of gradient descent training. Surprisingly, it is shown that the
network after sparsification can achieve as fast convergence as the dense
network, in comparison to the previous work indicating that the sparse networks
converge slower. Further, the required width is improved to ensure gradient
descent can drive the training error towards zero at a linear rate. Secondly,
the networks' generalization is studied: a width-sparsity dependence is
provided which yields a sparsity-dependent Rademacher complexity and
generalization bound. To our knowledge, this is the first sparsity-dependent
generalization result via Rademacher complexity. Lastly, this work further
studies the least eigenvalue of the limiting NTK. Surprisingly, while it is not
shown that trainable biases are necessary, trainable bias, which is enabled by
our improved analysis scheme, helps to identify a nice data-dependent region
where a much finer analysis of the NTK's smallest eigenvalue can be conducted.
This leads to a much sharper lower bound on the NTK's smallest eigenvalue than
the one previously known and, consequently, an improved generalization bound.

More precisely, our approach creates a special structure with fewer unique

Extensive experiments on image classification and semantic segmentation with

that $f$ is \emph{positive\/} if $f(x)$ is positive over all $x\geq0$. If all
the coefficients of $f$ are non-negative, then $f$ is trivially positive. In

This naturally raised a challenge: find an upper bound on the smallest degree
of multipliers. In 1918, Curtiss provided such a bound. Curtiss also showed
that the bound is optimal (smallest)\ when degree of $f$ is 1 or 2. It is easy
to show that the bound is not optimal when degree of $f$ is higher. The Curtiss
bound is a simple expression that depends only on the angle (argument) of
non-real roots of $f$. In this paper, we show that the Curtiss bound is optimal

better than the one defined from the minimal bipartite entanglement in

methods to neural networks and training the sparsified networks can not only
retain the testing performance of the original dense models, but also sometimes
even slightly boost the generalization performance. Theoretical understanding
for such experimental observations are yet to be developed. This work makes the
first attempt to study how different pruning fractions affect the model's
gradient descent dynamics and generalization. Specifically, this work considers
a classification task for overparameterized two-layer neural networks, where
the network is randomly pruned according to different rates at the

certain threshold, gradient descent can drive the training loss toward zero and
the network exhibits good generalization performance. More surprisingly, the
generalization bound gets better as the pruning fraction gets larger. To
complement this positive result, this work further shows a negative result:
there exists a large pruning fraction such that while gradient descent is still
able to drive the training loss toward zero (by memorizing noise), the
generalization performance is no better than random guessing. This further
suggests that pruning can change the feature learning process, which leads to
the performance drop of the pruned neural network.

combinatorial proof of the latter is provided next. We also show that the

maximum cut on a graph where edge weights in the cut represent dissimilarity
scores between two nodes based on their features. A small simulation result in
Blum, Coja-Oghlan, Frieze and Zhou (2007, 2009) shows that even when the sample
size $n$ is small, by increasing $p$ so that $np= \Omega(1/\gamma^2)$, one can
classify a mixture of two product populations using the spectral method therein
with success rate reaching an ``oracle'' curve. There the ``oracle'' was
computed assuming that distributions were known, where success rate means the

respective transport properties of the textiles. In today's used textiles, the
water vapor transmission (WVT) depends primarily on the porosity and the
wettability of the clothing layer next to the skin and is not adapting or
responsive on environmental conditions. The WVT is inevitably the same from
both sides of the membrane. In this study, we propose a novel approach by
development of a thermoresponsive Janus membrane using electrospinning
procedures. We, therefore, targeted a membrane as a bilayer composite structure
by use of PVDF as one layer and a blend of PVDF and PNIPAM as the second layer
changing wettability properties in the range of physiological temperatures.
Tailored electrospinning conditions led to a self-standing membrane
incorporating fiber diameters of 400nm, porosities of 50% for both layers
within the Janus membrane. The WVT studies revealed that the combined effects
of the Janus membrane's directional wettability and the temperature-responsive
property results in temperature-dependent vapor transport. The results show
that the membrane offers minimum resistance to WVT when the PVDF side faces the
skin, which depicts the side with high humidity, over a range of temperatures.
However, the same membrane shows a temperature-dependent WVT behavior when the
blend side faces the skin. From room temperature of 25 C to an elevated
temperature of 35 C, there is a significant increase in the membrane's
resistance to WVT. This behavior is attributed to the combined effect of the
Janus construct and the thermoresponsive property. This temperature-controlled
differential vapor transport offers ways to adapt vapor transport independence
of environmental conditions leading to an enhanced wearing comfort and
performance to be applied in fields such as apparel or the packaging industry.

two-dimensional and three-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard cells that are imposed

motivation of manipulating flow mode to control heat transfer efficiency. We
imposed three types of wall shear that may facilitate the single-roll, the
horizontally stacked double-roll, and the vertically stacked double-roll flow
modes, respectively. Direct numerical simulations are performed for fixed
Rayleigh number $Ra = 10^{8}$ and fixed Prandtl number $Pr = 5.3$, while the
wall-shear Reynolds number ($Re_{w}$) is in the range $60 \le Re_{w} \le 6000$.
Generally, we found enhanced heat transfer efficiency and global flow strength
with the increase of $Re_{w}$. However, even with the same magnitude of global
flow strength, the heat transfer efficiency varies significantly when the cells
are under different types of wall shear. An interesting finding is that by
increasing the wall-shear strength, the thermal turbulence is relaminarized,
and more surprisingly, the heat transfer efficiency in the laminar state is
higher than that in the turbulent state. We found that the enhanced heat
transfer efficiency at the laminar regime is due to the formation of more
stable and stronger convection channels. We propose that the origin of thermal
turbulence laminarization is the reduced amount of thermal plumes. Because
plumes are mainly responsible for turbulent kinetic energy production, when the
detached plumes are swept away by the wall shear, the reduced number of plumes
leads to weaker turbulent kinetic energy production. We also quantify the
efficiency of facilitating heat transport via external shearing, and find that
for larger $Re_{w}$, the enhanced heat transfer efficiency comes at a price of
a larger expenditure of mechanical energy.

blockchain are publicly accessible, we can understand the behavior of accounts
or detect illicit activities via transaction mining. Existing risk control
techniques have primarily been developed from the perspectives of
de-anonymizing address clustering and illicit account classification. However,
these techniques cannot be used to ascertain the potential risks for all
accounts and are limited by specific heuristic strategies or insufficient label
information. These constraints motivate us to seek an effective rating method
for quantifying the spread of risk in a transaction network. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of account risk rating on
Ethereum by proposing a novel model called RiskProp, which includes a
de-anonymous score to measure transaction anonymity and a network propagation
mechanism to formulate the relationships between accounts and transactions. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of RiskProp in overcoming the limitations of

Through case studies on the detected high-risk accounts, we demonstrate that
the risk assessment by RiskProp can be used to provide warnings for investors

to a volume-limited sample of observed SNe IIP shows decent agreement in
plateau luminosity, plateau duration and nickel mass for at least one of the

very small nickel mass $M_\mathrm{Ni}<0.01\,M_\odot$ and predict an
anticorrelation between plateau luminosity and plateau duration that is not

  Model by Random Projection",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The matrix factor model has drawn growing attention for its advantage in
achieving two-directional dimension reduction simultaneously for
matrix-structured observations. In this paper, we propose a simple iterative
least squares algorithm for matrix factor models, in contrast to the Principal
Component Analysis (PCA)-based methods in the literature. In detail, we first
propose to estimate the latent factor matrices by projecting the observations
with two deterministic weight matrices, which are chosen to diversify away the
idiosyncratic components. We show that the inferences on factors are still
asymptotically valid even if we overestimate both the row/column factor
numbers. We then estimate the row/column loading matrices by minimizing the
squared loss function under certain identifiability conditions. The resultant
estimators of the loading matrices are treated as the new weight/projection
matrices and thus the above update procedure can be iteratively performed until
convergence. Theoretically, given the true dimensions of the factor matrices,
we derive the convergence rates of the estimators for loading matrices and
common components at any $s$-th step iteration. Thorough numerical simulations
are conducted to investigate the finite-sample performance of the proposed
methods and two real datasets associated with financial portfolios and
multinational macroeconomic indices are used to illustrate practical
usefulness.

vortical and energy transport sector. The background solution has been computed
numerically. On this background, we have considered the fluctuation of the

correlators depend on the mass of the gauge field. Correlators such as the
current-current one, $\langle J_xJ_x\rangle$, which were completely absent in
the massless case, in the presence of a finite gauge boson mass start picking
up some finite value even at zero chemical potential. Similarly, the
energy-current correlator, $\langle T_{0x}J_x\rangle$, which was also absent in
the massless theory, has now a non-vanishing value but for finite values of the
chemical potential. Our findings for the chiral vortical conductivity,
$\sigma_V$, and the chiral magnetic/vortical conductivity of energy current,
$\sigma^\varepsilon_B = \sigma^\varepsilon_V$, are completely new results. In

depend linearly both on the pure Chern-Simon coupling, $\kappa$, and on the

reinforcement learning-based approaches notoriously suffers from poor data
efficiency issue. One of the reasons is that the goal information is decoupled
from the perception module and directly introduced as a condition of
decision-making, resulting in the goal-irrelevant features of the scene
representation playing an adversary role during the learning process. In light
of this, we present a novel Goal-guided Transformer-enabled reinforcement
learning (GTRL) approach by considering the physical goal states as an input of
the scene encoder for guiding the scene representation to couple with the goal
information and realizing efficient autonomous navigation. More specifically,
we propose a novel variant of the Vision Transformer as the backbone of the
perception system, namely Goal-guided Transformer (GoT), and pre-train it with
expert priors to boost the data efficiency. Subsequently, a reinforcement
learning algorithm is instantiated for the decision-making system, taking the
goal-oriented scene representation from the GoT as the input and generating
decision commands. As a result, our approach motivates the scene representation
to concentrate mainly on goal-relevant features, which substantially enhances
the data efficiency of the DRL learning process, leading to superior navigation
performance. Both simulation and real-world experimental results manifest the
superiority of our approach in terms of data efficiency, performance,
robustness, and sim-to-real generalization, compared with other state-of-art
baselines. Demonstration videos are available at

of the country's national export earnings. However, a lack of information on
where and how cashew trees grow across the country hinders decision-making that
could support increased cashew production and poverty alleviation. By
leveraging 2.4-m Planet Basemaps and 0.5-m aerial imagery, newly developed deep

produced the first national map of cashew in Benin and characterized the
expansion of cashew plantations between 2015 and 2021. In particular, we
developed a SpatioTemporal Classification with Attention (STCA) model to map
the distribution of cashew plantations, which can fully capture texture
information from discriminative time steps during a growing season. We further
developed a Clustering Augmented Self-supervised Temporal Classification
(CASTC) model to distinguish high-density versus low-density cashew plantations
by automatic feature extraction and optimized clustering. Results show that the
STCA model has an overall accuracy over 85% and the CASTC model achieved an
overall accuracy of 76%. We found that the cashew area in Benin almost doubled
from 2015 to 2021 with 60% of new plantation development coming from cropland

perturbation based on query feedback under a query budget. Due to the limited
feedback information, existing query-based black-box attack methods often
require many queries for attacking each benign example. To reduce query cost,
we propose to utilize the feedback information across historical attacks,
dubbed example-level adversarial transferability. Specifically, by treating the
attack on each benign example as one task, we develop a meta-learning framework
by training a meta-generator to produce perturbations conditioned on benign
examples. When attacking a new benign example, the meta generator can be
quickly fine-tuned based on the feedback information of the new task as well as
a few historical attacks to produce effective perturbations. Moreover, since
the meta-train procedure consumes many queries to learn a generalizable
generator, we utilize model-level adversarial transferability to train the
meta-generator on a white-box surrogate model, then transfer it to help the
attack against the target model. The proposed framework with the two types of
adversarial transferability can be naturally combined with any off-the-shelf
query-based attack methods to boost their performance, which is verified by
extensive experiments.

multiple-output (MIMO) transmitters with controllable cost. MIMO precoders are
required to frequently adapt based on the variations in the channel conditions.
In hybrid MIMO, here precoding is comprised of digital and analog beamforming,
such an adaptation involves lengthy optimization and depends on accurate
channel state information (CSI). This affects the spectral efficiency when the
channel varies rapidly and when operating with noisy CSI. In this work we
employ deep learning techniques to learn how to rapidly and robustly optimize
hybrid precoders, while being fully interpretable. We leverage data to learn
iteration-dependent hyperparameter settings of projected gradient sum-rate
optimization with a predefined number of iterations. The algorithm maps channel
realizations into hybrid precoding settings while preserving the interpretable
flow of the optimizer and improving its convergence speed. To cope with noisy
CSI, we learn to optimize the minimal achievable sum-rate among all tolerable
errors, proposing a robust hybrid precoding based on the projected conceptual
mirror prox minimax optimizer. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach
allows using over ten times less iterations compared to that required by
conventional optimization with shared hyperparameters, while achieving similar

target domain. To reduce discrepancy in feature distributions between two
domains, recent approaches achieve domain adaption through feature alignment in
different granularities via adversarial learning. However, they neglect the
relationship between multiple granularities and different features in
alignment, degrading detection. Addressing this, we introduce a unified
multi-granularity alignment (MGA)-based detection framework for
domain-invariant feature learning. The key is to encode the dependencies across
different granularities including pixel-, instance-, and category-levels
simultaneously to align two domains. Specifically, based on pixel-level
features, we first develop an omni-scale gated fusion (OSGF) module to
aggregate discriminative representations of instances with scale-aware
convolutions, leading to robust multi-scale detection. Besides, we introduce
multi-granularity discriminators to identify where, either source or target
domains, different granularities of samples come from. Note that, MGA not only
leverages instance discriminability in different categories but also exploits
category consistency between two domains for detection. Furthermore, we present
an adaptive exponential moving average (AEMA) strategy that explores model
assessments for model update to improve pseudo labels and alleviate local
misalignment problem, boosting detection robustness. Extensive experiments on
multiple domain adaption scenarios validate the superiority of MGA over other

(UAVs) to become widely known in the current era. The market of UAVs is also
predicted to continue growing with related technologies in the future. UAVs
have been used in various sectors, including livestock, forestry, and
agriculture. In agricultural applications, UAVs are highly capable of
increasing the productivity of the farm and reducing farmers' workload. This
paper discusses the application of UAVs in agriculture, particularly in
spraying and crop monitoring. This study examines the urgency of UAV
implementation in the agriculture sector. A short history of UAVs is provided
in this paper to portray the development of UAVs from time to time. The
classification of UAVs is also discussed to differentiate various types of
UAVs. The application of UAVs in spraying and crop monitoring is based on the
previous studies that have been done by many scientific groups and researchers
who are working closely to propose solutions for agriculture-related issues.
Furthermore, the limitations of UAV applications are also identified. The
challenges in implementing agricultural UAVs in Indonesia are also presented.

domain-invariant features. Most existing methods are built on distribution
matching, e.g., adversarial domain adaptation, which tends to corrupt feature
discriminability. In this paper, we propose Discriminative Radial Domain
Adaptation (DRDA) which bridges source and target domains via a shared radial
structure. It's motivated by the observation that as the model is trained to be
progressively discriminative, features of different categories expand outwards
in different directions, forming a radial structure. We show that transferring
such an inherently discriminative structure would enable to enhance feature
transferability and discriminability simultaneously. Specifically, we represent
each domain with a global anchor and each category a local anchor to form a
radial structure and reduce domain shift via structure matching. It consists of
two parts, namely isometric transformation to align the structure globally and
local refinement to match each category. To enhance the discriminability of the
structure, we further encourage samples to cluster close to the corresponding
local anchors based on optimal-transport assignment. Extensively experimenting
on multiple benchmarks, our method is shown to consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on varied tasks, including the typical unsupervised
domain adaptation, multi-source domain adaptation, domain-agnostic learning,

exist, and it maintains the basic features of inner balayage for positive

related but personalized ML models for different devices, whereas previous
works suffer from excessive communication overhead during training and neglect
the model heterogeneity among devices in MEC. Introducing knowledge
distillation into FMTL can simultaneously enable efficient communication and
model heterogeneity among clients, whereas existing methods rely on a public
dataset, which is impractical in reality. To tackle this dilemma, Federated
MultI-task Distillation for Multi-access Edge CompuTing (FedICT) is proposed.
FedICT direct local-global knowledge aloof during bi-directional distillation
processes between clients and the server, aiming to enable multi-task clients
while alleviating client drift derived from divergent optimization directions
of client-side local models. Specifically, FedICT includes Federated Prior
Knowledge Distillation (FPKD) and Local Knowledge Adjustment (LKA). FPKD is
proposed to reinforce the clients' fitting of local data by introducing prior
knowledge of local data distributions. Moreover, LKA is proposed to correct the
distillation loss of the server, making the transferred local knowledge better
match the generalized representation. Experiments on three datasets show that
FedICT significantly outperforms all compared benchmarks in various data
heterogeneous and model architecture settings, achieving improved accuracy with
less than 1.2% training communication overhead compared with FedAvg and no more

a simple yet powerful way to represent trajectories and measure the similarity

find that current models (both RNN-based and pre-training based) have more than
23\% inflected forms. As a result, the encoder will generate separate
embeddings for the inflected forms, leading to a waste of training data and
parameters. Even worse, in decoding these models are vulnerable to irrelevant
noise and they suffer from high computational costs. In this paper, we propose
an approach to enhance the performance of QG by fusing word transformation.
Firstly, we identify the inflected forms of words from the input of encoder,
and replace them with the root words, letting the encoder pay more attention to
the repetitive root words. Secondly, we propose to adapt QG as a combination of
the following actions in the encode-decoder framework: generating a question

framework comprises new architecture, protocol, semantic matching techniques,
and design principles for task-oriented wireless techniques. As the key
component of SEMDAS, we discuss a set of machine learning based semantic
matching techniques targeting different edge-intelligence use cases. Moreover,
for designing task-oriented wireless techniques, we discuss different tradeoffs
in SEMDAS systems, propose the new concept of joint semantics-and-channel
matching, and point to a number of research opportunities. The SEMDAS framework
not only overcomes the said communication bottleneck but also addresses other
networking issues including long-distance transmission, sparse connectivity,
high-speed mobility, link disruptions, and security. In addition, experimental

not only require intensive labeling in millimeter-level measurement but also
suffer from poor performance due to their dependence on specific landmarks or
simplified anatomical assumptions. In this paper, we propose a novel
semi-supervised framework to accurately measure the scale of MLS from head CT
scans. We formulate the MLS measurement task as a deformation estimation
problem and solve it using a few MLS slices with sparse labels. Meanwhile, with
the help of diffusion models, we are able to use a great number of unlabeled
MLS data and 2793 non-MLS cases for representation learning and regularization.
The extracted representation reflects how the image is different from a non-MLS
image and regularization serves an important role in the sparse-to-dense
refinement of the deformation field. Our experiment on a real clinical brain

posing a challenge for organizational design. Some design elements, such as
task allocation, become emergent properties that cannot be fully controlled
from the top down. The central question that arises in this context is: How can
bottom-up task allocation be guided towards an effective organizational
structure? To address this question, this paper presents a novel agent-based
model of an organization that features bottom-up task allocation that can be
motivated by either long-term or short-term orientation on the agents' side.
The model also includes an incentive mechanism to guide the bottom-up task
allocation process and create incentives that range from altruistic to
individualistic. Our analysis shows that when bottom-up task allocation is
driven by short-term orientation and aligned with the incentive mechanisms, it
leads to improved organizational performance that surpasses that of
traditionally designed organizations. Additionally, we find that the presence
of altruistic incentive mechanisms within the organization reduces the
importance of mirroring in task allocation.

travelling dispersive shock wave (TDSW). While there are existing solutions for
the RDSW and TDSW regimes obtained using modulation theory, there is no

apply this approach to investigate the influence of the longitudinal relaxation

discovered that the sudden death of the entanglement will occur as long as the
longitudinal relaxation is present. The transverse relaxation assists the
longitudinal relaxation and thus accelerates the finite-time disentanglement.

task with context representation of BERT relative models for the RTE problem.
The experimental results give conclusions about the influence and role of
semantic representation on Vietnamese in understanding natural language. The
experimental results show that the semantic-aware contextual representation
model has about 1% higher performance than the model that does not incorporate
semantic representation. In addition, the effects on the data domain in
Vietnamese are also higher than those in English. This result also shows the
positive influence of SRL on RTE problem in Vietnamese.

the effect of meteoritic water infiltration could be discriminated from that of
sea-level rise on triggering paleolandslides. It is possible to identify the
cause of coastal paleolandslides based on the age of occurrence and comparison
with climatic signals when glacial maxima are more humid than during
interglacial times, as in Polynesia and East Equatorial Africa, but not in
other cases (Caribbean, Indonesia). The role of pore pressure variations and
sea-water loading variations has been discussed. The interaction between the
relative sea-level rise, preexisting relief and deep weak structure due to the
presence of highly weathered lavas may trigger the conditions for a large
landslide. Highly weathered lavas have very low friction angles at depth in
volcanic islands. When volcanoes are still actives, pressure variation of the
magma chamber caused by sea-level lowering is expected to play a significant
role in destabilization of the relief. Competing processes in real cases cause
difficulties to discriminate between these processes.

developed. In the investigated framework, a set of servers cooperatively
transmit images to a set of users utilizing semantic communication techniques.
To evaluate the performance of studied semantic communication system, a
multimodal metric is proposed to measure the correlation between the extracted
semantic information and the original image. To meet the ISS requirement of
each user, each server must jointly determine the semantic information to be
transmitted and the resource blocks (RBs) used for semantic information
transmission. We formulate this problem as an optimization problem aiming to
minimize each server's transmission latency while reaching the ISS requirement.
To solve this problem, a value decomposition based entropy-maximized
multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed, which enables servers to
coordinate for training and execute RB allocation in a distributed manner to
approach to a globally optimal performance with less training iterations.
Compared to traditional multi-agent RL, the proposed RL improves the valuable
action exploration of servers and the probability of finding a globally optimal
RB allocation policy based on local observation. Simulation results show that
the proposed algorithm can reduce the transmission delay by up to 16.1%
compared to traditional multi-agent RL.

explanations boost (or even determine) classification. That is, end-to-end
learning of explanation factors to augment discriminative representation
extraction could be a more intuitive strategy to inversely assure fine-grained
explainability, e.g., in those neuroimaging and neuroscience studies with
high-dimensional data containing noisy, redundant, and task-irrelevant
information. In this paper, we propose such an explainable geometric deep
network dubbed as NeuroExplainer, with applications to uncover altered infant
cortical development patterns associated with preterm birth. Given fundamental
cortical attributes as network input, our NeuroExplainer adopts a hierarchical
attention-decoding framework to learn fine-grained attentions and respective
discriminative representations to accurately recognize preterm infants from
term-born infants at term-equivalent age. NeuroExplainer learns the
hierarchical attention-decoding modules under subject-level weak supervision
coupled with targeted regularizers deduced from domain knowledge regarding
brain development. These prior-guided constraints implicitly maximizes the
explainability metrics (i.e., fidelity, sparsity, and stability) in network
training, driving the learned network to output detailed explanations and
accurate classifications. Experimental results on the public dHCP benchmark
suggest that NeuroExplainer led to quantitatively reliable explanation results
that are qualitatively consistent with representative neuroimaging studies.

divide the training set into clean and noisy sets based on small training loss.
However, the quick convergence of co-teaching models to select the same clean
subsets combined with relatively fast overfitting of noisy labels may induce
the wrong selection of noisy label samples as clean, leading to an inevitable
confirmation bias that damages accuracy. In this paper, we introduce our
noisy-label learning approach, called Asymmetric Co-teaching (AsyCo), which
introduces novel prediction disagreement that produces more consistent

approach that does not require small-loss assumption to enable a better

  Representation Learning",,,,,"cs.CY cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we study the problem of MOOC quality evaluation which is
essential for improving the course materials, promoting students' learning
efficiency, and benefiting user services. While achieving promising
performances, current works still suffer from the complicated interactions and
relationships of entities in MOOC platforms. To tackle the challenges, we
formulate the problem as a course representation learning task-based and
develop an Information-aware Graph Representation Learning(IaGRL) for
multi-view MOOC quality evaluation. Specifically, We first build a MOOC
Heterogeneous Network (HIN) to represent the interactions and relationships
among entities in MOOC platforms. And then we decompose the MOOC HIN into
multiple single-relation graphs based on meta-paths to depict the multi-view
semantics of courses. The course representation learning can be further
converted to a multi-view graph representation task. Different from traditional
graph representation learning, the learned course representations are expected
to match the following three types of validity: (1) the agreement on
expressiveness between the raw course portfolio and the learned course
representations; (2) the consistency between the representations in each view
and the unified representations; (3) the alignment between the course and MOOC
platform representations. Therefore, we propose to exploit mutual information
for preserving the validity of course representations. We conduct extensive
experiments over real-world MOOC datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method.

is and the potential it holds to both advance and hamper educational
opportunities that may improve the human condition. We offer a basic
introduction to different methods and philosophies underpinning AI, discuss
recent advances, explore applications to education, and highlight key
limitations and risks. We conclude with a set of questions that educationalists
may ask as they encounter AI in their research and practice. Our hope is to
make often jargon-laden terms and concepts accessible, so that all are equipped
to understand, interrogate, and ultimately shape the development of human

question context and memory across multi-step tasks, such that experiments can
test its deductive reasoning. This paper proposes a multi-role and multi-step
challenge, where ChatGPT plays the classic twenty-questions game but
innovatively switches roles from the questioner to the answerer. The main
empirical result establishes that this generation of chat applications can
guess random object names in fewer than twenty questions (average, 12) and
correctly guess 94% of the time across sixteen different experimental setups.
The research introduces four novel cases where the chatbot fields the
questions, asks the questions, both question-answer roles, and finally tries to
guess appropriate contextual emotions. One task that humans typically fail but
trained chat applications complete involves playing bilingual games of twenty
questions (English answers to Spanish questions). Future variations address
direct problem-solving using a similar inquisitive format to arrive at novel
outcomes deductively, such as patentable inventions or combination thinking.
Featured applications of this dialogue format include complex protein designs,
neuroscience metadata, and child development educational materials.

difficult task due to the complexity of the arbitrariness of shape, size, and
texture of lung nodules. This is a challenge to be faced when coming to
developing different solutions to improve detection systems. the deep learning
approach showed promising results by using convolutional neural network (CNN),
especially for image recognition and it's one of the most used algorithm in
computer vision. Approach: we use (CNN) building blocks based on YOLOv5 (you
only look once) to learn the features representations for nodule detection
labels, in this paper, we introduce a method for detecting lung cancer
localization. Chest X-rays and low-dose computed tomography are also possible
screening methods, When it comes to recognizing nodules in radiography,
computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system based on (CNN) have demonstrated their
worth. One-stage detector YOLOv5 trained on 280 annotated CT SCAN from a public
dataset LIDC-IDRI based on segmented pulmonary nodules. Results: we analyze the
predictions performance of the lung nodule locations, and demarcates the
relevant CT scan regions. In lung nodule localization the accuracy is measured
as mean average precision (mAP). the mAP takes into account how well the
bounding boxes are fitting the labels as well as how accurate the predicted
classes for those bounding boxes, the accuracy we got 92.27%. Conclusion: this
study was to identify the nodule that were developing in the lungs of the
participants. It was difficult to find information on lung nodules in medical
literature.

existing AI/ML techniques rely on sufficient well-labeled data and may suffer
from slow convergence and poor generalizability. In this article, focusing on
digital twin-assisted wireless unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems, we
provide a survey of emerging techniques that can enable fast-converging
data-driven control of wireless systems with enhanced generalization capability
to new environments. These include SLAM-based sensing and network
softwarization for digital twin construction, robust reinforcement learning and
system identification for domain adaptation, and testing facility sharing and
federation. The corresponding research opportunities are also discussed.

  arXiv:2206.01734",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Currently, weed control in commercial corn production is performed without
considering weed distribution information in the field. This kind of weed
management practice leads to excessive amounts of chemical herbicides being
applied in a given field. The objective of this study was to perform
site-specific weed control (SSWC) in a corn field by 1) using an unmanned
aerial system (UAS) to map the spatial distribution information of weeds in the
field; 2) creating a prescription map based on the weed distribution map, and
3) spraying the field using the prescription map and a commercial size sprayer.
In this study, we are proposing a Crop Row Identification (CRI) algorithm, a
computer vision algorithm that identifies corn rows on UAS imagery. After being
identified, the corn rows were then removed from the imagery and the remaining
vegetation fraction was classified as weeds. Based on that information, a
grid-based weed prescription map was created and the weed control application
was implemented through a commercial-size sprayer. The decision of spraying
herbicides on a particular grid was based on the presence of weeds in that grid
cell. All the grids that contained at least one weed were sprayed, while the
grids free of weeds were not. Using our SSWC approach, we were able to save
26.23\% of the land (1.97 acres) from being sprayed with chemical herbicides
compared to the existing method. This study presents a full workflow from UAS
image collection to field weed control implementation using a commercial-size
sprayer, and it shows that some level of savings can potentially be obtained
even in a situation with high weed infestation, which might provide an
opportunity to reduce chemical usage in corn production systems.

degree d or those zeros that lie in a fixed region of interest on the complex
plane such as a disc or a square. Our divide and conquer algorithm of STOC 1995
supports solution of this problem in optimal Boolean time (up to a
poly-logarithmic factor), that is, runs nearly as fast as one can access the
coefficients of p with the precision necessary to support required accuracy of
the output. That record complexity has not been matched by any other algorithm
yet, but our root-finder of 1995 is quite involved and has never been
implemented. We present alternative nearly optimal root-finders based on our
novel variants of the classical subdivision iterations. Unlike our predecessor
of 1995, we require randomization of Las Vegas type, allowing us to detect any
output error at a dominated computational cost, but our new root-finders are
much simpler to implement than their predecessor of 1995. According to the
results of extensive test with standard test polynomials for their preliminary
version, which incorporates only a part of our novel techniques, the new
root-finders compete and for a large class of inputs significantly supersedes
the package of root-finding subroutines MPSolve, which for decades has been
user's choice package. Unlike our predecessor of 1995 and all known fast
algorithms for the cited tasks of polynomial root-finding, our new algorithms
can be also applied to a polynomial given by a black box oracle for its
evaluation rather than by its coefficients. This makes our root-finders
particularly efficient for polynomials p(x) that can be evaluated fast such as
the Mandelbrot polynomials or those given by the sum of a small number of
shifted monomials. Our algorithm can be readily extended to fast approximation
of the eigenvalues of a matrix or a matrix polynomial.

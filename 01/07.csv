Accepted to The Astrophysical Journal",,"10.3847/1538-4357/acaf57",,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Many star-forming galaxies and those hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN)
show evidence of massive outflows of material in a variety of phases including
ionized, neutral atomic, and molecular. Molecular outflows in particular have
been the focus of recent interest as they may be responsible for removing gas
from the galaxy, thereby suppressing star formation. As material is ejected
from the cores of galaxies, interactions of the outflowing material with the
interstellar medium can accelerate cosmic rays and produce high-energy gamma
rays. In this work, we search for gamma-ray emission from a sample of local
galaxies known to host molecular outflows using data collected by the {\fermi}
Large Area Telescope. We employ a stacking technique in order to search for and
characterize the average gamma-ray emission properties of the sample. Gamma-ray
emission is detected from the galaxies in our sample at the $4.4 \, \sigma$
level with a power-law photon index of $\Gamma \approx 2$ in the 1-800 GeV
energy range. The emission is found to correlate with tracers of star formation
activity, namely the $8-1000 \: \mu$m infrared luminosity. We also find that
the observed signal can be predominantly attributed to \ion{H}{ii} galaxies
hosting energy-driven outflows. While we do not find evidence suggesting that
the outflows are accelerating charged particles directly, galaxies with
molecular outflows may produce more gamma rays than galaxies without outflows.
In particular, the set consisting of gamma-ray-detected galaxies with molecular
outflows are nearly perfect calorimeters and may be future targets for searches
of high-energy neutrinos.

  Human Capital","JEL Codes: I26, J24, J31, M54",,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Cognitive endurance -- the ability to sustain performance on a
cognitively-demanding task over time -- is thought to be a crucial productivity
determinant. However, a lack of data on this variable has limited researchers'
ability to understand its role for success in college and the labor market.
This paper uses college-admission-exam records from 15 million Brazilian high
school students to measure cognitive endurance based on changes in performance
throughout the exam. By exploiting exogenous variation in the order of exam
questions, I show that students are 7.1 percentage points more likely to
correctly answer a given question when it appears at the beginning of the day
versus the end (relative to a sample mean of 34.3%). I develop a method to
decompose test scores into fatigue-adjusted ability and cognitive endurance. I
then merge these measures into a higher-education census and the earnings
records of the universe of Brazilian formal-sector workers to quantify the
association between endurance and long-run outcomes. I find that cognitive
endurance has a statistically and economically significant wage return.
Controlling for fatigue-adjusted ability and other student characteristics, a
one-standard-deviation higher endurance predicts a 5.4% wage increase. This
wage return to endurance is sizable, equivalent to a third of the wage return
to ability. I also document positive associations between endurance and college
attendance, college quality, college graduation, firm quality, and other
outcomes. Finally, I show how systematic differences in endurance across
students interact with the exam design to determine the sorting of students to
colleges. I discuss the implications of these findings for the use of cognitive
assessments for talent selection and investments in interventions that build
cognitive endurance.

disaggregated shared memory. Porting existing synchronization primitives to
disaggregated shared memory results in poor scalability with the number of

cache-coherence substrates, which engenders redundant inter-core
communications. Substantially higher cache-coherence latency ($\mu$s) with
substantially lower bandwidths in state-of-the-art disaggregated shared memory
designs amplifies the impact of such redundant communications and precludes
scalability.
  In this work, we argue for a co-design for the cache-coherence and
synchronization layers for better performance scaling of multi-threaded
applications on disaggregated memory. This is driven by our observation that
synchronization primitives are essentially a generalization of cache-coherence
protocols in time and space. We present GCS as an implementation of this
co-design. GCS employs wait queues and arbitrarily-sized cache lines directly
at the cache-coherence protocol layer for temporal and spatial generalization.
We evaluate GCS against the layered approach for synchronization primitives:
the pthread implementation of reader-writer lock, and show that GCS improves
in-memory key-value store performance at scale by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude.

photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPS and HAXPES) is used to monitor diffusion in
real-time across a proxy device. The device consists of a
Si/SiO\textsubscript{2}/Ti$_x$W$_{1-x}$(300 nm)/Cu(25 nm) thin film material
stack, with the Ti$_x$W$_{1-x}$ film acting as a diffusion barrier between Si

collection of spectra whilst in-situ annealing to 673 K. Ti within the TiW is
found to be highly mobile during annealing, diffusing out of the barrier and
accumulating at the Cu surface. Increasing the Ti concentration within the
Ti$_x$W$_{1-x}$ film increases the quantity of accumulated Ti, and Ti is first
detected at the Cu surface at temperatures as low as 550 K. Surprisingly, at
low Ti concentrations ($x$ = 0.054), W is also mobile and diffuses alongside
Ti. These results provide crucial evidence for the importance of diffusion
barrier composition on their efficacy during device application, delivering
insights into the mechanisms underlying their effectiveness and limitations.

long-term indices of solar activity. They are strongly correlated, which led to
the publication of many proxy relations allowing to convert one index onto the
other. However, those existing proxies show significant disagreements, in
particular at low solar activity. Our aim is to bring a global clarification of
those many issues. We compute new polynomial regressions up to degree 4, in
order to obtain a more accurate proxy. We also study the role of temporal
averaging on the regression, and we investigate the issue of the all-quiet
$F_{10.7}$ background flux. Finally, we check for any change in the $F_{10.7}$
-- sunspot number relation over the entire period 1947 -- 2015. We find that,
with a $4^{th}$-degree polynomial, we obtain a more accurate proxy relation
than all previous published ones, and we derive a formula giving standard
errors. The relation is different for daily, monthly and yearly mean values,
and it proves to be fully linear for raw non-averaged daily data. By a simple
two-component model for daily values, we show how temporal averaging leads to
non-linear proxy relations. We also show that the quiet-Sun $F_{10.7}$
background is not absolute and actually depends on the duration of the spotless
periods. Finally, we find that the $F_{10.7cm}$ time series is inhomogeneous,
with an abrupt 10.5% upward jump occurring between 1980 and 1981. Our new proxy
relations show the importance of temporal scale for choosing the appropriate
proxy and the $F_{10.7}$ quiet-Sun background level. From historical evidence,
we conclude that the 1981 jump is most likely due to a unique change in the
$F_{10.7}$ scientific team and the data processing, and that the newly
re-calibrated sunspot number (version2) will probably provide the only possible
reference to correct this inhomogeneity.

COVID-19 and more people returning to work from the office, the transmission of
COVID-19 during commuting becomes a concern. Recent emerging mobility services
(such as ride-hailing and bike-sharing) further deteriorate the infection risks
due to shared vehicles or spaces during travel. Hence, it is important to
quantify the infection risks in commuting. This paper proposes a probabilistic
framework to estimate the risk of infection during an individual's commute
considering different travel modes, including public transit, ride-share, bike,
and walking. The objective is to evaluate the probability of infection as well
as the estimation errors (i.e., uncertainty quantification) given the
origin-destination (OD), departure time, and travel mode. We first define a
general trip planning function to generate trip trajectories and probabilities
of choosing different paths according to the OD, departure time, and travel
mode. Then, we consider two channels of infections: 1) infection by close
contact and 2) infection by touching surfaces. The infection risks are
calculated on a trip segment basis. Different sources of data (such as smart
card data, travel surveys, and population data) are used to estimate the
potential interactions between the individual and the infectious environment.
The model is implemented in the MIT community as a case study. We evaluate the
commute infection risks for employees and students. Results show that most of
the individuals have an infection probability close to zero. The maximum
infection probability is around 0.8%, implying that the probability of getting
infected during the commuting process is low. Individuals with larger travel
distances, traveling in transit, and traveling during peak hours are more
likely to get infected.

estimating the intensity of key natural phenomena such as floods, earthquakes,

spatial/spectral resolution and their revisiting time, a consequence of design
and physical constraints imposed by satellite orbit among other technical
limitations. In this paper, we focus on fusing multi-temporal, multi-spectral
images where data acquired from different instruments with different spatial
resolutions is used. We leverage the spatial relationship between images at
multiple modalities to generate high-resolution image sequences at higher
revisiting rates. To achieve this goal, we formulate the fusion method as a
recursive state estimation problem and study its performance in filtering and
smoothing contexts. Furthermore, a calibration strategy is proposed to estimate
the time-varying temporal dynamics of the image sequence using only a small
amount of historical image data. Differently from the training process in
traditional machine learning algorithms, which usually require large datasets
and computation times, the parameters of the temporal dynamical model are
calibrated based on an analytical expression that uses only two of the images
in the historical dataset. A distributed version of the Bayesian filtering and
smoothing strategies is also proposed to reduce its computational complexity.
To evaluate the proposed methodology we consider a water mapping task where
real data acquired by the Landsat and MODIS instruments are fused generating
high spatial-temporal resolution image estimates. Our experiments show that the
proposed methodology outperforms the competing methods in both estimation
accuracy and water mapping tasks.

Therefore, tracing the impact of the chosen circuit architecture and

with the stellar luminosity ($L$) and the convective core radius ($r_{\rm

values for the overshooting distance that significantly increase with stellar

time of the nearly-adiabatic layer. This growth seems to slow down as the upper
edge of the nearly-adiabatic layer gets closer to the maximum overshooting
length and as the simulation time exceeds the typical thermal diffusive
timescale in the overshooting layer.

used for various applications including electrocardiogram (ECG) filtering can
be computationally demanding and the choice of their hyperparameters is
typically ad hoc. Methods: We develop a data-driven GP filter to address both
issues, using the notion of the ECG phase domain -- a time-warped
representation of the ECG beats onto a fixed number of samples and aligned
R-peaks, which is assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. Under this
assumption, the computation of the sample mean and covariance matrix is
simplified, enabling an efficient implementation of the GP filter in a
data-driven manner, with no ad hoc hyperparameters. The proposed filter is
evaluated and compared with a state-of-the-art wavelet-based filter, on the
PhysioNet QT Database. The performance is evaluated by measuring the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement of the filter at SNR levels ranging
from -5 to 30dB, in 5dB steps, using additive noise. For a clinical evaluation,
the error between the estimated QT-intervals of the original and filtered
signals is measured and compared with the benchmark filter. Results: It is
shown that the proposed GP filter outperforms the benchmark filter for all the
tested noise levels. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art filter in terms
of QT-interval estimation error bias and variance. Conclusion: The proposed GP
filter is a versatile technique for preprocessing the ECG in clinical and
research applications, is applicable to ECG of arbitrary lengths and sampling
frequencies, and provides confidence intervals for its performance.

more importantly, the lack of clinical validation. As such, we propose a system
designed specifically for the diagnosis of colorectal samples. The construction
of such a system consisted of four stages: (1) a careful data collection and
annotation process, which resulted in one of the largest WSI colorectal samples
datasets; (2) the design of an interpretable mixed-supervision scheme to
leverage the domain knowledge introduced by pathologists through spatial
annotations; (3) the development of an effective sampling approach based on the
expected severeness of each tile, which decreased the computation cost by a
factor of almost 6x; (4) the creation of a prototype that integrates the full

them are external and completely independent. On the largest of those sets, the

While topological invariants were originally mathematically introduced for

dynamical effects can break the translational symmetry and imply the use of
larger simulation cells, where the $\bf{k}$-point sampling is typically reduced

neural networks as data-driven priors. A powerful approach uses scan-specific
(SS) priors that leverage information regarding the underlying physical signal
model for reconstruction. SS priors are learned on each individual test scan
without the need for a training dataset, albeit they suffer from
computationally burdening inference with nonlinear networks. An alternative
approach uses scan-general (SG) priors that instead leverage information
regarding the latent features of MRI images for reconstruction. SG priors are
frozen at test time for efficiency, albeit they require learning from a large
training dataset. Here, we introduce a novel parallel-stream fusion model
(PSFNet) that synergistically fuses SS and SG priors for performant MRI
reconstruction in low-data regimes, while maintaining competitive inference
times to SG methods. PSFNet implements its SG prior based on a nonlinear
network, yet it forms its SS prior based on a linear network to maintain
efficiency. A pervasive framework for combining multiple priors in MRI
reconstruction is algorithmic unrolling that uses serially alternated
projections, causing error propagation under low-data regimes. To alleviate
error propagation, PSFNet combines its SS and SG priors via a novel

are performed on multi-coil brain MRI for varying amounts of training data.
PSFNet outperforms SG methods in low-data regimes, and surpasses SS methods

branch (post-AGB) binary systems show many similarities with protoplanetary

binary evolution and the formation of macrostructures within circumstellar
discs. Here we focus on one post-AGB binary system: IRAS08544-4431. We aim to
refine the physical model of IRAS08544-4431 with a radiative transfer treatment
and continue the near-infrared and mid-infrared interferometric analysis
covering the H-, K-, L-, and N-bands. We aim to capture the previously detected
amount of over-resolved flux and the radial intensity profile at and beyond the
inner dust disc rim to put constraints on the physical processes in the inner
disc regions. We used a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code to investigate the
physical structure of the disc by reproducing both the photometry and the
multi-wavelength infrared interferometric data set. We developed a strategy to
identify the models which perform best to reproduce our data set. We found a
family of models that successfully fit the infrared photometric and
interferometric data in all bands. Some over-resolved flux component was
recovered in all bands but the optimised models still fall short to explain all
the over-resolved flux. This suggests that another dusty structure within the
system plays a role. Multi-wavelength infrared interferometric observations of
circumstellar discs allow to study the inner disc regions in unprecedented
detail. The refined physical models can reproduce most of the investigated
features, including the photometric characteristics, the radial extent, and the
overall shape of the visibility curves. Our multi-wavelength interferometric
observations combined with photometry show that the disc is similar to
protoplanetary discs with similar dust masses and efficient dust growth.

one seeks for a concurrent algorithm for verifying that the current execution
of a given concurrent shared object implementation is linearizable. It shows
that it is impossible to runtime verify linearizability for some common
sequential objects, regardless of the consensus power of base objects. Then, it
argues that actually a stronger version of the problem can be solved, if
linearizability is verified indirectly. Namely, it shows that (1)
linearizability of a class of concurrent implementations can be strongly
verified using only read/write base objects (i.e. without the need of
consensus), and (2) any implementation can be transformed to its counterpart in
the class (which implements the same object) using only read/write objects too.
As far as we know, this is the first runtime verification algorithm for any
correctness condition that is fully asynchronous and fault-tolerant. As a
by-product, a simple and generic methodology for deriving self-enforced
linearizable implementations is obtained. This type implementations produce
outputs that are guaranteed linearizable, and are able to produce a certificate
of it, which allows the design of concurrent systems in a modular manner with
accountable and forensic guarantees. These results hold not only for
linearizability but for a correctness condition that includes generalizations
of it such as set-linearizability and interval-linearizability.

for Gamma Knife (GK) radiosurgery. The methodology accounts for cases involving
targets of any number, size, and shape. Methods: Data from 322 GK treatment
plans was modified by isolating and cropping the contoured MRI and clinical
dose distributions based on tumor location, then scaling the resulting tumor
spaces to a standard size. An accompanying 3D tensor was created for each
instance to account for tumor size. The modified dataset for 272 patients was
used to train both a generative adversarial network (GAN-GK) and a 3D U-Net
model (U-Net-GK). Unmodified data was used to train equivalent baseline models.
All models were used to predict the dose distribution of 50 out-of-sample
patients. Prediction accuracy was evaluated using gamma, with criteria of
4%/2mm, 3%/3mm, 3%/1mm and 1%/1mm. Prediction quality was assessed using
coverage, selectivity, and conformity indices. Results: The predictions
resulting from GAN-GK and U-Net-GK were similar to their clinical counterparts,
with average gamma (4%/2mm) passing rates of 84.9 and 83.1, respectively. In
contrast, the gamma passing rate of baseline models were significantly worse
than their respective GK-specific models (p < 0.001) at all criterion levels.
The quality of GK-specific predictions was also similar to that of clinical
plans. Conclusion: Deep learning models can use GK-specific data modification
to predict 3D dose distributions for GKRS plans with a large range in size,
shape, or number of targets. Standard deep learning models applied to
unmodified GK data generated poorer predictions.

orders of magnitude simpler than previous NN methods, but the concept is
translatable across microscope modalities. We demonstrated the method on a
two-photon, a three-photon and a widefield three-dimensional (3D) structured
illumination microscope. Results showed that the method outperformed
commonly-used modal-based sensorless AO methods. We also showed that our
ML-based method was robust in a range of challenging imaging conditions, such
as extended 3D sample structures, specimen motion, low signal to noise ratio
and activity-induced fluorescence fluctuations. Moreover, as the bespoke
architecture encapsulated physical understanding of the imaging process, the
internal NN configuration was no-longer a ``black box'', but provided physical
insights on internal workings, which could influence future designs.

This paper proposes a new
quantitative methodology to characterize, measure, and test the existence of
climate change heterogeneity. It consists of three steps. First, we introduce a
new testable warming typology based on the evolution of the trend of the whole
temperature distribution and not only on the average. Second, we define the
concepts of warming acceleration and warming amplification in a testable
format. And third, we introduce the new testable concept of warming dominance
to determine whether region A is suffering a worse warming process than region
B. Applying this three-step methodology, we find that Spain and the Globe
experience a clear distributional warming process (beyond the standard average)
but of different types. In both cases, this process is accelerating over time
and asymmetrically amplified. Overall, warming in Spain dominates the Globe in
all the quantiles except the lower tail of the global temperature distribution
that corresponds to the Arctic region. Our climate change heterogeneity results
open the door to the need for a non-uniform causal-effect climate analysis that
goes beyond the standard causality in mean as well as for a more efficient
design of the mitigation-adaptation policies. In particular, the heterogeneity
we find suggests that these policies should contain a common global component
and a clear local-regional element. Future climate agreements should take the
whole temperature distribution into account.

experimental constraints from $\varepsilon_K$, $\Delta M_s$, $\Delta M_d$ and
the mixing induced CP asymmetries $S_{\psi K_S}$ and $S_{\psi K_S}$, we

($H_{0}$) independently of other traditional methods. The main limitation to
the precision of time-delay cosmography is mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD). Some of
the previous TDCOSMO analyses broke the MSD by making standard assumptions
about the mass density profile of the lens galaxy, reaching 2% precision from
seven lenses. However, this approach could potentially bias the $H_0$
measurement or underestimate the errors. In this work, for the first time, we
break the MSD using spatially resolved kinematics of the lens galaxy in
RXJ1131$-$1231 obtained from the Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy, in
combination with previously published time delay and lens models derived from
Hubble Space Telescope imaging. This approach allows us to robustly estimate
$H_0$, effectively implementing a maximally flexible mass model. Following a
blind analysis, we estimate the angular diameter distance to the lens galaxy
$D_{\rm d} = 865_{-81}^{+85}$ Mpc and the time-delay distance $D_{\Delta t} =
2180_{-271}^{+472}$ Mpc, giving $H_0 = 77.1_{-7.1}^{+7.3}$ km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$ - for a flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmology. The error budget
accounts for all uncertainties, including the MSD inherent to the lens mass
profile and the line-of-sight effects, and those related to the mass-anisotropy
degeneracy and projection effects. Our new measurement is in excellent
agreement with those obtained in the past using standard simply parametrized
mass profiles for this single system ($H_0 = 78.3^{+3.4}_{-3.3}$ km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$) and for seven lenses ($H_0 = 74.2_{-1.6}^{+1.6}$ km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$), or for seven lenses using single-aperture kinematics and the same
maximally flexible models used by us ($H_0 = 73.3^{+5.8}_{-5.8}$ km s$^{-1}$

other T Tauri stars. Although it is one of the most extensively studied
pre-main sequence stars, observations with millimeter interferometry have so
far been relatively limited. We present NOEMA images of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO,
C$^{18}$O, SO, DCO$^+$, and H$_2$CO toward DR Tau at a resolution of
$\sim0.5''$ ($\sim100$ au). In addition to the protoplanetary disk, CO emission
reveals an envelope, a faint asymmetric outflow, and a spiral arm with a clump.
The $\sim1200$ au extent of the CO arm far exceeds that of the spiral arms
previously detected in scattered light, which underlines the necessity of
sensitive molecular imaging for contextualizing the disk environment. The
kinematics and compact emission distribution of C$^{18}$O, SO, DCO$^+$, and
H$_2$CO indicate that they originate primarily from within the Keplerian
circumstellar disk. The SO emission, though, also exhibits an asymmetry that
may be due to interaction with infalling material or unresolved substructure.
The complex environment of DR Tau is reminiscent of those of outbursting FUor
sources and some EXor sources, suggesting that DR Tau's extreme stellar
activity could likewise be linked to disk instabilities promoted by large-scale
infall.

equivalent width (EW) of HeII 1640A depend on the black hole mass and Eddington
ratio inferred from MgII 2800A. Above L/L_Edd>0.2, there is a strong mass
dependence in both CIV blueshift and HeII EW. Large CIV blueshifts are observed
only in regions with both high mass and high accretion rate. Including X-ray
measurements for a subsample of 5,000 objects, we interpret our observations in
the context of AGN accretion and outflow mechanisms. The observed trends in
HeII and 2 keV strength are broadly consistent with theoretical QSOSED models
of AGN spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for low spin black holes, where the
ionizing SED depends on the accretion disc temperature and the strength of the
soft excess. High spin models are not consistent with observations, suggesting
SDSS quasars at z=2 may in general have low spins. We find a dramatic switch in
behaviour at L/L_Edd<0.2: the ultraviolet emission properties show much weaker
trends, and no longer agree with QSOSED predictions, hinting at changes in the
structure of the broad line region. Overall the observed emission line trends
are generally consistent with predictions for radiation line driving where
quasar outflows are governed by the SED, which itself results from the
accretion flow and hence depends on both the SMBH mass and accretion rate.

Universe. How this radiation escapes the cold neutral gas (HI) of galaxies with
sufficiently little absorption to reionize the intergalactic medium is poorly
understood. HI has never been mapped in confirmed LyC-emitters, leaving major
uncertainties on how LyC photons escape galaxies and ionize the intergalactic
medium. We imaged the 21cm HI emission of nearby reionization-era analog galaxy
Haro 11 to identify how ionizing radiation escapes the neutral interstellar
medium. We find that merger-driven interactions have tidally displaced up to
82% of the neutral gas from the ultraviolet emission production sites in the
galaxy, allowing the escape of ionizing radiation to the intergalactic medium.
Increased galaxy interactions in the early Universe predicted by cosmological
models could contribute significantly to the reionization of the Universe.

resolve the bulk electronic states of candidate topological semimetal FeSi

disk of Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) are frequently observed in Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Winds with a velocity often exceeding $0.1c$ are called
Ultra-Fast-Outflows (UFOs) and thanks to their high power they can play a key
role in the co-evolution between the SMBH and the host galaxy. In order to
construct a proper model of the properties of these winds, it is necessary to
consider special relativistic corrections due to their very high velocities. We
present a derivation of the Poynting-Robertson effect (P-R effect) and apply it
to the description of the dynamics of UFOs. The P-R effect is a special
relativistic correction which breaks the isotropy of the radiation emitted by a
moving particle funneling the radiation in the direction of motion. As a result
of the conservation of the four-momentum, the emitting particles are subjected
to a drag force and decelerate. We provide a derivation of the drag force
caused by the P-R effect starting from general Lorentz transformations and
assuming isotropic emission in the gas reference frame. Then, we derive the
equations to easily implement this drag force in future simulations. Finally,
we apply them in a toy model in which the gas particles move radially under the
influence of the gravitation force, the radiation pressure and the drag due to
the P-R effect. P-R effect plays an important role in determining the velocity
profile of the wind. For a wind launched from $r_0=10r_s$ (where $r_S$ stands
for the Schwarzschild radius), the asymptotic velocity reached by the wind is
between $10$% and $24$% smaller than the one it would possess if we neglect the
effect. This shows that the P-R effect should be taken into account when
studying the dynamics of high-velocity, photoionized outflows in general.

that the star formation in proto-clusters is strongly impacted by the choice of
the SMBH seeding as well as the orbital decay of SMBHs. Feedback from AGNs is
substantially boosted by the SMBH decay, its time evolution and impact range
differ noticeably depending on the AGN energy injection scheme used. Compared
to a mass-weighted injection whose energy remains confined close to the central
SMBHs, a volume-weighted thermal energy deposition allows to heat the ICM out
to large radii which severely quenches the star formation in proto-clusters. By
flattening out temperature gradients in the ICM, anisotropic thermal conduction
can reduce star formation early on but weakens and delays the AGN activity.
Despite the dissimilarities found in the stellar and gaseous content of our
haloes, the cluster scaling relations we report are surprisingly insensitive to
the subresolution models used and are in good agreement with recent

However, there is a big gap between the noise models often assumed by error

important for understanding implications of structural distortions, disorder,

photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements. We describe an extension of
the fold2Bloch package by implementing an arbitrary transformation matrix used
to establish a relation between primitive cell and supercell. This development
allows us to overcome limitations of supercells constructed exclusively by
scaling of primitive cell lattice vectors. It becomes possible to transform
between primitive and conventional cells as well as include rotations. The
fold2Bloch is publicaly available from a GitHub repository as a FORTRAN code.
It interfaces with the all-electron full-potential WIEN2k and the

supplemented by additional pre- and post-processing utilities that aid in
generating k points in the supercell (such that they later fall onto a desired
path in the primitive Brillouin zone after unfolding) and plotting the unfolded
band structure. We selected Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ as an illustrative example and, for
the first time, present its properly unfolded band structure in direct
comparison with ARPES measurements. In addition, critical importance of the

extensible, cross-platform, and general MRI simulation framework (Koma).
  Methods: Koma was developed using the Julia programming language. Like other
MRI simulators, it solves the Bloch equations with CPU and GPU parallelization.
The inputs are the scanner parameters, the phantom, and the pulse sequence that
is Pulseq-compatible. The raw data is stored in the ISMRMRD format. For the
reconstruction, MRIReco.jl is used. A graphical user interface utilizing web
technologies was also designed. Two types of experiments were performed: one to
compare the quality of the results and the execution speed, and the second to
compare its usability. Finally, the use of Koma in quantitative imaging was
demonstrated by simulating Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF)
acquisitions.
  Results: Koma was compared to two well-known open-source MRI simulators,
JEMRIS and MRiLab. Highly accurate results (with MAEs below 0.1% compared to
JEMRIS) and better GPU performance than MRiLab were demonstrated. In an
experiment with students, Koma was proved to be easy to use, eight times faster
on personal computers than JEMRIS, and 65% of them recommended it. The
potential for designing acquisition and reconstruction techniques was also
shown through the simulation of MRF acquisitions, with conclusions that agree
with the literature.
  Conclusions: Koma's speed and flexibility have the potential to make
simulations more accessible for education and research. Koma is expected to be
used for designing and testing novel pulse sequences before implementing them
in the scanner with Pulseq files, and for creating synthetic data to train
machine learning models.

nodes as references.
  Recent few-shot node classification methods typically learn from classes with
abundant labeled nodes (i.e., meta-training classes) and then generalize to
classes with limited labeled nodes (i.e., meta-test classes). Nevertheless, on
real-world graphs, it is usually difficult to obtain abundant labeled nodes for
many classes. In practice, each meta-training class can only consist of several
labeled nodes, known as the extremely weak supervision problem. In few-shot
node classification, with extremely limited labeled nodes for meta-training,
the generalization gap between meta-training and meta-test will become larger
and thus lead to suboptimal performance. To tackle this issue, we study a novel
problem of few-shot node classification with extremely weak supervision and
propose a principled framework X-FNC under the prevalent meta-learning
framework. Specifically, our goal is to accumulate meta-knowledge across
different meta-training tasks with extremely weak supervision and generalize
such knowledge to meta-test tasks. To address the challenges resulting from
extremely scarce labeled nodes, we propose two essential modules to obtain
pseudo-labeled nodes as extra references and effectively learn from extremely
limited supervision information. We further conduct extensive experiments on
four node classification datasets with extremely weak supervision to validate
the superiority of our framework compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.

  processing in C. elegans",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Animals must integrate sensory cues with their current behavioral context to
generate a suitable response. How this integration occurs is poorly understood.
Previously we developed high throughput methods to probe neural activity in
populations of Caenorhabditis elegans and discovered that the animal?s
mechanosensory processing is rapidly modulated by the animal?s locomotion.
Specifically we found that when the worm turns it suppresses its
mechanosensory-evoked reversal response. Here we report that C. elegans use
inhibitory feedback from turning-associated neurons to provide this rapid
modulation of mechanosensory processing. By performing high-throughput
optogenetic perturbations triggered on behavior, we show that turning
associated neurons SAA, RIV and/or SMB suppress mechanosensory-evoked reversals
during turns. We find that activation of the gentle-touch mechanosensory
neurons or of any of the interneurons AIZ, RIM, AIB and AVE during a turn is
less likely to evoke a reversal than activation during forward movement.
Inhibiting neurons SAA, RIV and SMB during a turn restores the likelihood with
which mechanosensory activation evokes reversals. Separately, activation of
premotor interneuron AVA evokes reversals regardless of whether the animal is
turning or moving forward. We therefore propose that inhibitory signals from
SAA, RIV and/or SMB gate mechanosensory signals upstream of neuron AVA. We
conclude that C. elegans rely on inhibitory feedback from the motor circuit to
modulate its response to sensory stimuli on fast timescales. This need for
motor signals in sensory processing may explain the ubiquity in many organisms
of motor-related neural activity patterns seen across the brain, including in
sensory processing areas.

We present a proof of concept, showing that the Bisous filament finder can
improve the detected filamentary network with photometric redshift data. We
created mock data from the MultiDark-Galaxies catalogue. Galaxies with
spectroscopic redshifts were given exact positions from the simulation.
Galaxies with photometric redshifts were given uncertainties along one
coordinate. The errors were generated with different Gaussian distributions for
different samples. There are three different types of samples: spectroscopic
only, photometric only, and mixed samples of galaxies with photometric and
spectroscopic redshifts. In photometric-only samples, the larger the
uncertainty for photometric redshifts, the fewer filaments are detected, and
the filaments strongly align along the line of sight. Using mixed samples
improves the number of filaments detected and decreases the alignment bias of
those filaments. The results are compared against the full spectroscopic
sample. The recall for photometric-only samples depends heavily on the size of
uncertainty and dropped close to 20%; for mixed samples, the recall stayed
between 40% and 80%. The false discovery rate stayed below 5% in every sample

to most previously studied electrides, these materials are expected to be more

The origin of the two slopes is unknown, but does hold for the duration of the

oscillations while the ALMA data do not. However, removing IBIS data at times

for the two data series nearly identical. Spatial maps of the power integrated
over p-mode frequency bands agree well between the two data series and show the
typical pattern of magnetic shadows and halos found in many chromospheric

determine what processes accelerate energetic particles. Parker Solar Probe
returned a treasure trove of science data that far exceeded quality,
significance, and quantity expectations, leading to a significant number of
discoveries reported in nearly 700 peer-reviewed publications. The first four
years of the 7-year primary mission duration have been mostly during solar

computational linguistics with music as well as music cognition. Our
experimental results reveal an 0.81 probability of matching on average, and
around 30% of the songs have a probability of 0.9 or higher of keywords landing

Numerous people have perished due to inaccurate COVID-19 identification and,

address this issue by researchers worldwide. Typically, automatic feature
extraction methods, particularly deep learning models, necessitate a powerful
hardware system to perform the necessary computations. Unfortunately, many
institutions and societies cannot benefit from these advancements due to the
prohibitively high cost of high-quality hardware equipment. As a result, this
study focused on two primary goals: first, lowering the computational costs
associated with running the proposed model on embedded devices, mobile devices,
and conventional computers; and second, improving the model's performance in
comparison to previously published methods (at least performs on par with

the medical recognition task. This study used two neural networks to improve
feature extraction from our dataset: VGG19 and ResNet50V2. Both of these
networks are capable of providing semantic features from the nominated dataset.
To this end, An alternative network was considered, namely MobileNetV2, which
excels at extracting semantic features while requiring minimal computation on
mobile and embedded devices. Knowledge distillation (KD) was used to transfer
knowledge from the teacher network (concatenated ResNet50V2 and VGG19) to the

the spread of harmful content. However, the efficacy of this strategy in
limiting the delivery of harmful content to users is not well understood. In
this paper, we create a framework to quantify the efficacy of content
moderation and use our metrics to analyze content removal on Facebook within
the U.S. news ecosystem. In a data set of over 2M posts with 1.6B user
engagements collected from 2,551 U.S. news sources before and during the
Capitol Riot on January 6, 2021, we identify 10,811 removed posts. We find that
the active engagement life cycle of Facebook posts is very short, with 90% of
all engagement occurring within the first 30 hours after posting. Thus, even
relatively quick intervention allowed significant accrual of engagement before
removal, and prevented only 21% of the predicted engagement potential during a
baseline period before the U.S. Capitol attack. Nearly a week after the attack,
Facebook began removing older content, but these removals occurred so late in
these posts' engagement life cycles that they disrupted less than 1% of
predicted future engagement, highlighting the limited impact of this
intervention. Content moderation likely has limits in its ability to prevent
engagement, especially in a crisis, and we recommend that other approaches such
as slowing down the rate of content diffusion be investigated.

materials for lightweight structural applications in the automotive and
electronics industries. Typically, SFRC structures are manufactured by
injection molding, which induces heterogeneous microstructures, and the
resulting nonlinear anisotropic behaviors are challenging to predict by
conventional micromechanical analyses. In this work, we present a machine
learning-based multiscale method by integrating injection molding-induced
microstructures, material homogenization, and Deep Material Network (DMN) in
the finite element simulation software LS-DYNA for structural analysis of SFRC.
DMN is a physics-embedded machine learning model that learns the microscale
material morphologies hidden in representative volume elements of composites
through offline training. By coupling DMN with finite elements, we have
developed a highly accurate and efficient data-driven approach, which predicts
nonlinear behaviors of composite materials and structures at a computational
speed orders-of-magnitude faster than the high-fidelity direct numerical
simulation. To model industrial-scale SFRC products, transfer learning is
utilized to generate a unified DMN database, which effectively captures the
effects of injection molding-induced fiber orientations and volume fractions on
the overall composite properties. Numerical examples are presented to
demonstrate the promising performance of this LS-DYNA machine learning-based

employing data splitting, which divide the data into disjoint parts for
separate purposes. However despite their usefulness in principle, randomised
tests have obvious drawbacks. Firstly, two analyses of the same dataset may
lead to different results. Secondly, the test typically loses power because it
does not fully utilise the entire sample. As a remedy to these drawbacks, we
study how to combine the test statistics or p-values resulting from multiple
random realisations such as through random data splits. We introduce
rank-transformed subsampling as a general method for delivering large sample
inference about the combined statistic or p-value under mild assumptions. We
apply our methodology to a range of problems, including testing unimodality in
high-dimensional data, testing goodness-of-fit of parametric quantile
regression models, testing no direct effect in a sequentially randomised trial
and calibrating cross-fit double machine learning confidence intervals. For the
latter, our method improves coverage in finite samples and for the testing
problems, our method is able to derandomise and improve power. Moreover, in
contrast to existing p-value aggregation schemes that can be highly
conservative, our method enjoys type-I error control that asymptotically
approaches the nominal level.

Practitioners typically perform PCA assuming the data conforms to Euclidean
geometry. However, for specific data types, such as hierarchical data, other
geometrical spaces may be more appropriate. We study PCA in space forms; that
is, those with constant positive (spherical) and negative (hyperbolic)
curvatures, in addition to zero-curvature (Euclidean) spaces. At any point on a
Riemannian manifold, one can define a Riemannian affine subspace based on a set
of tangent vectors and use invertible maps to project tangent vectors to the
manifold and vice versa. Finding a low-dimensional Riemannian affine subspace
for a set of points in a space form amounts to dimensionality reduction
because, as we show, any such affine subspace is isometric to a space form of
the same dimension and curvature. To find principal components, we seek a
(Riemannian) affine subspace that best represents a set of manifold-valued data
points with the minimum average cost of projecting data points onto the affine
subspace. We propose specific cost functions that bring about two major
benefits: (1) the affine subspace can be estimated by solving an eigenequation
-- similar to that of Euclidean PCA, and (2) optimal affine subspaces of
different dimensions form a nested set. These properties provide advances over
existing methods which are mostly iterative algorithms with slow convergence
and weaker theoretical guarantees. Specifically for hyperbolic PCA, the
associated eigenequation operates in the Lorentzian space, endowed with an
indefinite inner product; we thus establish a connection between Lorentzian and
Euclidean eigenequations. We evaluate the proposed space form PCA on data sets
simulated in spherical and hyperbolic spaces and show that it outperforms
alternative methods in convergence speed or accuracy, often both.

achieve independent driving, braking, and steering of each wheel, providing a
good application platform for autonomous driving technology. Path planning and
tracking control, in particular, are critical components of autonomous driving.
However, It is challenging to comprehensively design an robust control
algorithm by integrating vehicle path planning in a complicated unstructured
scenario for FDWEV. To address the above issue, this paper first proposes the
artificial potential field (APF) method for path planning in the prescribed
park with different static obstacles to generate the reference path
information, where speed planning is incorporated considering kinematics and
dynamic constraints. Second, two tracking control methods, curvature
calculation (CC-based) and model predictive control (MPC-based) methods with
the lateral dynamics model, are proposed to track the desired path under
different driving conditions, in which a forward-looking behavior model of the
driver with variable preview distance is designed based on fuzzy control
theory. CarSim-AMESim-Simulink co-simulation is conducted with the existence of
obstacles. The simulation results show that the proposed two control approaches
are effective for many driving scenarios and the MPC-based path-tracking
controller enhances dynamic tracking performance and ensures good
maneuverability under high-dynamic driving conditions.

equivalent to a concave program and provide a version of the dominance theorem

we approximate the problem to obtain a quadratic concave program and derive
necessary and sufficient optimality conditions. Additionally, we prove a

two optimal weights from the optimality conditions is still optimal. We test
our proposed methods using both intraday and daily price data. Finally, we
extend our empirical studies to an online trading scenario by implementing a

those in the field can provide insight into how and when locally-observed
trends between galaxy properties and environment emerged. Six Lyman-alpha
nebulae were discovered at z~2.3 in a blind search of the GOODS-S extragalactic
field, a region also covered by the 3D-HST spectroscopic survey. Utilizing
3D-HST data, we identified 86 galaxies in the vicinity of these nebulae and
used statistical tests to compare their physical properties to galaxies
elsewhere in the field. Galaxies lying within 320 proper kpc of a Lyman-alpha
nebula are roughly half a magnitude brighter than those in the field, with
higher stellar masses, higher star formation rates, and larger effective radii.
Even when considering the effects of sample incompleteness, our study suggests
that galaxies in overdensities at z~2.3 traced by Lyman-alpha nebulae are being
influenced by their environment. Furthermore, Lyman-alpha nebula-associated
galaxies lie on the same main sequence of star formation as field galaxies, but
have a larger proportion of high-mass galaxies, consistent with the idea that
galaxy evolution is accelerated in rich environments. Expanded surveys for
Lyman-alpha nebulae in other deep extragalactic fields and galaxy spectroscopic

density, size and position. Each laser shot captures particles within a large
volume, where images can be computationally refocused to determine particle
size and shape. However, processing these holograms, either with standard
methods or with machine learning (ML) models, requires considerable
computational resources, time and occasional human intervention. ML models are
trained on simulated holograms obtained from the physical model of the probe
since real holograms have no absolute truth labels. Using another processing
method to produce labels would be subject to errors that the ML model would
subsequently inherit. Models perform well on real holograms only when image
corruption is performed on the simulated images during training, thereby
mimicking non-ideal conditions in the actual probe (Schreck et. al, 2022).
Optimizing image corruption requires a cumbersome manual labeling effort.
  Here we demonstrate the application of the neural style translation approach
(Gatys et. al, 2016) to the simulated holograms. With a pre-trained
convolutional neural network (VGG-19), the simulated holograms are ``stylized''
to resemble the real ones obtained from the probe, while at the same time
preserving the simulated image ``content'' (e.g. the particle locations and
sizes). Two image similarity metrics concur that the stylized images are more
like real holograms than the synthetic ones. With an ML model trained to
predict particle locations and shapes on the stylized data sets, we observed
comparable performance on both simulated and real holograms, obviating the need
to perform manual labeling. The described approach is not specific to hologram
images and could be applied in other domains for capturing noise and
imperfections in observational instruments to make simulated data more like
real world observations.

a transition from a 2D TI to a 2D trivial insulator, just as predicted by
theory. The high degree of tunability available in epitaxial cadmium arsenide
heterostructures can thus be used to fine-tune the 2D TI, which is essential
for future topological devices.

this paper designs a two-dimensional elastic plate with adjustable topological

of elastic wave local control and energy harvesting devices due to its
adjustable topological corner states, which facilitate the application of

reach a magnitude of 1350 $\mu$A/V&^2&, observable experimentally. We further
predict that the MnPSe$_3$ monolayer could be two-dimensional ferrotoroidic,
again depending on its Neel vector direction, which can be determined via
magnetoelectric response measurements. Our work provides an exemplary platform

oscillator system is proposed using the conformable derivative concept. In
other words, the integer derivatives are replaced by conformable derivatives of
order $\alpha$ with $0<\alpha\leq 1$. The corresponding conformable
Euler-Lagrange equations of motion and fractional Hamiltonian are then
obtained. The system is then canonically quantized and the conformable
Schrodinger equation is constructed. The fractional-order dependence of the
energy eigenvalues $E_n ^\alpha$ and eigenfunctions $\psi_n ^\alpha$ are
obtained using using suitable transformations and the extended fractional
Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The corresponding conformable continuity equation is
also derived and the probability density and probability current are thus
suitably defined. The probability density evolution as well as its dependence
on $\alpha$ is plotted and analyzed for various situations. It is found that
the energy eigenvalues are real and there are sort of gradual ordering in the
behavior of the probability densities.

extended H2 halo surrounding an ionised central bubble is imprinted with spiral
structures, likely shaped by a low-mass companion orbiting the central star at

salient object detection in optical remote sensing images (ORSI-SOD) are
proposed. However, most methods ignore the huge parameters and computational
cost brought by CNNs, and only a few pay attention to the portability and
mobility. To facilitate practical applications, in this paper, we propose a
novel lightweight network for ORSI-SOD based on semantic matching and edge
alignment, termed SeaNet. Specifically, SeaNet includes a lightweight
MobileNet-V2 for feature extraction, a dynamic semantic matching module (DSMM)
for high-level features, an edge self-alignment module (ESAM) for low-level
features, and a portable decoder for inference. First, the high-level features
are compressed into semantic kernels. Then, semantic kernels are used to
activate salient object locations in two groups of high-level features through
dynamic convolution operations in DSMM. Meanwhile, in ESAM, cross-scale edge
information extracted from two groups of low-level features is self-aligned
through L2 loss and used for detail enhancement. Finally, starting from the
highest-level features, the decoder infers salient objects based on the
accurate locations and fine details contained in the outputs of the two
modules. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight SeaNet not only outperforms most state-of-the-art lightweight
methods but also yields comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art conventional
methods, while having only 2.76M parameters and running with 1.7G FLOPs for

explainability: Which fraction of the input graph is the most determinant of
the prediction? Particularly, parametric explainers prevail in existing
approaches because of their stronger capability to decipher the black-box
(i.e., the target GNN). In this paper, based on the observation that graphs
typically share some joint motif patterns, we propose a novel non-parametric
subgraph matching framework, dubbed MatchExplainer, to explore explanatory
subgraphs. It couples the target graph with other counterpart instances and
identifies the most crucial joint substructure by minimizing the node
corresponding-based distance. Moreover, we note that present graph sampling or
node-dropping methods usually suffer from the false positive sampling problem.
To ameliorate that issue, we design a new augmentation paradigm named
MatchDrop. It takes advantage of MatchExplainer to fix the most informative
portion of the graph and merely operates graph augmentations on the rest less
informative part. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our MatchExplainer by
outperforming all parametric baselines with significant margins. Additional
results also demonstrate that our MatchDrop is a general scheme to be equipped

question answering, but incompleteness is an urgent issue for their broad
application. Much research in knowledge graph completion (KGC) has been
performed to resolve this issue. The methods of KGC can be classified into two
major categories: rule-based reasoning and embedding-based reasoning. The
former has high accuracy and good interpretability, but a major challenge is to
obtain effective rules on large-scale KGs. The latter has good efficiency and
scalability, but it relies heavily on data richness and cannot fully use domain
knowledge in the form of logical rules. We propose a novel method that injects
rules and learns representations iteratively to take full advantage of rules
and embeddings. Specifically, we model the conclusions of rule groundings as
0-1 variables and use a rule confidence regularizer to remove the uncertainty
of the conclusions. The proposed approach has the following advantages: 1) It
combines the benefits of both rules and knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) and
achieves a good balance between efficiency and scalability. 2) It uses an
iterative method to continuously improve KGEs and remove incorrect rule
conclusions. Evaluations on two public datasets show that our method
outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, improving performance by

supervisor which ensures in the closed-loop system, faults are isolatable in
the sense that after a fault occurs, we can determine which type the fault

supervisor starts to work when the occurrence of faults is detected. We then
solve the isolation supervisor synthesis problem as follows. For a given

includes all feasible isolation supervisors. An isolation supervisor is
feasible if it enforces only events that are physically possible. We then
develop an algorithm to check whether the synthesis problem is solvable or not.

be equal peers with processors through non-intrusive, bi-directionally
cache-coherent integration. In contrast to existing CPU-FPGA hybrid systems in
which the processors play a supportive role, Duet unleashes the full potential
of both the processors and the eFPGAs with two classes of post-fabrication
enhancements: fine-grained acceleration, which partitions an application into
small tasks and offloads the frequently-invoked, compute-intensive ones onto
various small accelerators, leveraging the processors to handle dynamic control
flow and less accelerable tasks; hardware augmentation, which employs
eFPGA-emulated hardware widgets to improve processor efficiency or mitigate
software overheads in certain execution models. An RTL-level implementation of
Duet is developed to evaluate the architecture with high fidelity. Experiments
using synthetic benchmarks show that Duet can reduce the processor-accelerator
communication latency by up to 82% and increase the bandwidth by up to 9.5x.
The RTL implementation is further evaluated with seven application benchmarks,

information for more effective cost aggregation and meanwhile provides feedback
to feature learning to guide more effective contextual feature extraction. The
proposed CGF can be easily embedded into many existing stereo matching
networks, such as PSMNet, GwcNet and ACVNet. The resulting networks show a
significant improvement in accuracy. Specially, the model which incorporates
our CGF with ACVNet ranks $1^{st}$ on the KITTI 2012 and 2015 leaderboards
among all the published methods. We further propose an informative and concise
cost volume, named Attention Feature Volume (AFV), which exploits a correlation
volume as attention weights to filter a feature volume. Based on CGF and AFV,
the proposed CGI-Stereo outperforms all other published real-time methods on

other fields. However, most of the existing research work on the fireworks
algorithm is improved based on its defects, and little consideration is given
to reducing the number of parameters of the fireworks algorithm. The original

algorithm adjustment and is not conducive to engineering applications. In
addition, in the fireworks population, the unselected individuals are
discarded, thus causing a waste of their location information. To reduce the

constructs an adaptive explosion radius by using the historical optimal

three-dimensional cells observed on detonation fronts in reactive gases. Its
physical premise is that the dynamics of the transverse waves of irregular
cells obeys a stochastic process both stationary and ergodic and produces the
same burnt mass per unit of time as the average planar steady ZND process.
Graph theory then defines an ideal cell whose grouping is equivalent to the
actual 3D cellular front, geometric probabilities determine the mean burned
fraction that parameterizes the model, and ZND calculations close the problem
with the time-position relationship of a fluid element in the ZND reaction
zone. The model is limited to detonation reaction zones whose sole ignition
mechanism is adiabatic shock compression, such as those of the mixtures with
H2, C3H8 or C2H4 as fuels considered in this work. Indeed, the comparison of
their measured and calculated widths shows an agreement better than or within
the accepted experimental uncertainties, depending on the quality of the
chemical kinetic scheme used for the ZND calculations. However, the comparison
for CH4:O2 mixtures shows high overestimates, indirectly confirming that the
detonation reaction zones in these mixtures certainly include other ignition
mechanisms contributing to the combustion process, such as turbulent diffusion.
In these situations, the cell mean width derived from longitudinal soot
recordings shows a very large scatter and may thus not be a relevant detonation
characteristic length. The model is easily implementable as a post-process of
ZND profiles and provides fast estimates of the cell width, length and reaction
time.

memory (LSTM) and the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers
(BERT) word embedding, enriched by an improved artificial bee colony (ABC)
algorithm for pretraining and a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for
training backpropagation (BP) algorithm. BERT can be comprised in downstream
work and fine-tuned as a united task-specific architecture, and the pretrained
BERT model can grab different linguistic effects. Existing algorithms typically
train the AS model with positive-negative pairs for a two-class classifier. A
positive pair contains a question and a genuine answer, while a negative one
includes a question and a fake answer. The output should be one for positive
and zero for negative pairs. Typically, negative pairs are more than positive,
leading to an imbalanced classification that drastically reduces system
performance. To deal with it, we define classification as a sequential
decision-making process in which the agent takes a sample at each step and
classifies it. For each classification operation, the agent receives a reward,
in which the prize of the majority class is less than the reward of the
minority class. Ultimately, the agent finds the optimal value for the policy
weights. We initialize the policy weights with the improved ABC algorithm. The
initial value technique can prevent problems such as getting stuck in the local
optimum. Although ABC serves well in most tasks, there is still a weakness in
the ABC algorithm that disregards the fitness of related pairs of individuals
in discovering a neighboring food source position.

  Computer for Reasoning-based Question Answering",,,,,"cs.AI cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reasoning and question answering as a basic cognitive function for humans, is
nevertheless a great challenge for current artificial intelligence. Although
the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC) model could solve such problems to a
certain extent, the development is still limited by its high algorithm
complexity, slow convergence speed, and poor test robustness. Inspired by the
learning and memory mechanism of the brain, this paper proposed a Memory
Transformation based Differentiable Neural Computer (MT-DNC) model. MT-DNC
incorporates working memory and long-term memory into DNC, and realizes the
autonomous transformation of acquired experience between working memory and
long-term memory, thereby helping to effectively extract acquired knowledge to
improve reasoning ability. Experimental results on bAbI question answering task
demonstrated that our proposed method achieves superior performance and faster
convergence speed compared to other existing DNN and DNC models. Ablation
studies also indicated that the memory transformation from working memory to
long-term memory plays essential role in improving the robustness and stability
of reasoning. This work explores how brain-inspired memory transformation can
be integrated and applied to complex intelligent dialogue and reasoning
systems.

(2-d) Shallow water Equations (SWE) when the interaction of shallow flows with
obstacles is modelled. The exact solution of the Single Porosity (SP) Riemann
problem, which is the building block of numerous porosity models solved with
the Finite Volume method, exhibits an interesting feature, namely the
multiplicity of solutions when a supercritical flow impinges on a sudden
porosity reduction. In the present paper, this ambiguity is overcome by
systematically comparing the solution of the one-dimensional (1-d) SP Riemann
problem with the corresponding 2-d SWE numerical solutions at local porosity
discontinuities. An additional result of this comparison is that the SP Riemann
problem should incorporate an adequate amount of head loss through porosity
discontinuities when strongly supercritical flows are considered. An
approximate Riemann solver, able to pick the physically congruent solution
among the alternatives and equipped with the required head loss amount, shows
promising results when implemented in a 1-d Single Porosity Finite Volume

  Quantum Universe","50 pages+22 pages, 2 figures",,,,"gr-qc hep-th quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  $SU(\infty)$-QGR is a foundationally quantum approach to gravity. It assumes
that Hilbert spaces of the Universe as a whole and its subsystems represent the
symmetry group $SU(\infty)$. The Universe is divided to infinite number of
subsystems based on an arbitrary finite rank symmetry group $G$, which arises
due to quantum fluctuations and clustering of states. After selection of two
arbitrary subsystems as clock and reference observer, subsystems acquire a
relative dynamics, and gravity emerges as a $SU(\infty)$ Yang-Mills quantum
field theory, defined on the (3+1)-dimensional parameter space of Hilbert
spaces of the subsystems. As a Yang-Mills model $SU(\infty)$-QGR is
renormalizable and despite prediction of a spin-1 field for gravity at quantum
level, when QGR effects are not detectable, it is perceived similar to Einstein
gravity. The aim of the present work is to make the foundation of
$SU(\infty)$-QGR more mathematically rigorous and fill the gaps in the
construction of the model reported in earlier works. In particular, we show
that the global $SU(\infty)$ symmetry manifests itself through the entanglement
of every subsystem with the rest of the Universe. Moreover, we demonstrate
irrelevance of the geometry of parameter space, which can be gauged out by a
$SU(\infty)$ gauge transformation up to an irrelevant constant. Therefore,
$SU(\infty)$-QGR deviates from gauge-gravity duality models, because the
perceived classical spacetime is neither quantized, nor considered to be
non-commutative. In fact, using quantum uncertainty relations, we demonstrate
that the classical spacetime and its perceived geometry present the average
path of the ensemble of quantum states of subsystems in their parameter space.
Thus, $SU(\infty)$-QGR explains both the dimension and signature of the
classical spacetime. We also briefly discuss $SU(\infty)$-QGR specific models
for dark energy.

Though a number of methods have been developed in the past decades, it is still
quite challenging to design quality guaranteed algorithm with low complexity

algorithm, that was developed for solving the ordinary $k$-center clustering
problem. Based on some novel observations, we show that a simple randomized
version of this greedy strategy actually can handle outliers efficiently. We
further show that this randomized greedy approach also yields small coreset for
the problem in doubling metrics (even if the doubling dimension is not given),
which can greatly reduce the computational complexity. Moreover, together with
the partial clustering framework proposed in arXiv:1703.01539 , we prove that
our coreset method can be applied to distributed data with a low communication
complexity. The experimental results suggest that our algorithms can achieve
near optimal solutions and yield lower complexities comparing with the existing
methods.

its latest 80 days long spin-up episode in 2019 when the spin frequency of the
pulsar increased by ~2% over two orbits of the binary. By performing
time-resolved spectroscopy with the MAXI/GSC spectra of the source, we
estimated the equivalent hydrogen column density and equivalent width of the
iron fluorescence line during the spin-up episode, and compared them with the
long-term average values estimated by orbital-phase resolved spectroscopy. The
measured absorption column density during the spin-up episode is about twice
that of an average orbit, while the equivalent width of the iron line is less
than half of an average orbit. Though the spin-up episode started immediately
after a pre-periastron flare and lasted for the two consecutive orbits of the
binary, the associated enhancement in luminosity started a few days after the
pre-periastron flare and lasted only during the first orbit, and some
enhancement was seen again during the pre-periastron passage of the second

throughout the spin-up episode and are distinct from an average orbit. These
observations indicate a significant change in the accretion and reprocessing

extensively tested at low and intermediate redshifts. These include a high
[OIII]/[OII] flux ratio, high star-formation surface density, and compact
sizes. In this work, we present observations of 29 $4.5 \leq z \leq 8$
gravitationally lensed galaxies in the Abell 2744 cluster field. From a
combined analysis of JWST-NIRSpec and NIRCam data, we accurately derived their

$(\log(M_\star)\sim 8.5)$, blue UV spectral slopes ($\beta \sim -2.1$), compact
sizes ($r_e \sim 0.3-0.5$ kpc), and high [OIII]/[OII] flux ratios. We confirm
that these properties are similar to those characterizing low-redshift LyC
leakers. Indirectly inferring the fraction of escaping ionizing photons, we
find that more than 80% of our galaxies have predicted $f_{esc}$ values larger
than 0.05, indicating that they would be considered leakers. The average
predicted $f_{esc}$ value of our sample is 0.12, suggesting that similar

the epidemiological dynamics using a spatio-temporal extended

epidemiological model. Results and Conclusions: We provide an algorithm to

as a function of several epidemiological and economic properties. We show that
the recovery and basic infection rates have a similar economic influence.
Unintuitively, we show that in the context of a botanic pandemic, a larger farm

a significant benefit of using the proposed seeding strategy and shed more

that we guide the bug finding process by considering that existing bugs have

dozens of bugs for targeted apps such as Brave (web browser app). BugRMSys's

antiferromagnetically ordered along the b axis and the moments in the octahedra
are still antiferromagnetically ordered along the c axis. Under high pressure,
the Fe4O5 exhibits magnetic transitions with corresponding electronic
transitions of the metal-insulator type. At a critical pressure PC ~ 60 GPa the
Fe ions at the octahedral sites undergo a high-spin to low-spin state crossover
with a decrease in the unit-cell volume of ~ 4%, while the Fe ions at the
prismatic sites remain in the high-spin state up to 130 GPa. This
site-dependent magnetic collapse is experimentally observed in the
transformation of M\""ossbauer spectra measured at room temperature and high

constitute a discrete analog of conformal field theories. These circuits are
quantum cellular automata which are invariant under the joint action of Lorentz
and scale transformations. Dual unitaries are four-legged tensors which satisfy
the unitarity condition across the time as well as the space direction, a
property that makes the model mathematically tractable. Using dual unitaries
too, we construct tensor-network states for our 1+1 model, which are
interpreted as spatial slices of curved 2+1 discrete geometries, where the
metric distance is defined by the entanglement structure of the state,
following Ryu-Takayanagi's prescription. The dynamics of the circuit induces a
natural dynamics on these geometries, which we study for flat and anti-de
Sitter spaces, and in the presence or absence of matter. We observe that the
dynamics of spaces with two or more particles differs from that of zero or one,
suggesting the presence of black holes. But this contrasts with the fact that
the family of models appears to be non-chaotic. We observe that the dynamics of
a particle in such spaces strongly depends on the presence of other particles,
suggesting gravitational back-reaction.

computing a representation of an already-seen context and using this
representation to predict the next word. Currently, most LMs calculate these
representations through a neural network consuming the immediate previous
context. However recently, retrieval-augmented LMs have shown to improve over
standard neural LMs, by accessing information retrieved from a large datastore,
in addition to their standard, parametric, next-word prediction. In this paper,
we set out to understand why retrieval-augmented language models, and
specifically why k-nearest neighbor language models (kNN-LMs) perform better
than standard parametric LMs, even when the k-nearest neighbor component
retrieves examples from the same training set that the LM was originally
trained on. To this end, we perform a careful analysis of the various
dimensions over which kNN-LM diverges from standard LMs, and investigate these
dimensions one by one. Empirically, we identify three main reasons why kNN-LM
performs better than standard LMs: using a different input representation for
predicting the next tokens, approximate kNN search, and the importance of
softmax temperature for the kNN distribution. Further, we incorporate these
insights into the model architecture or the training procedure of the standard
parametric LM, improving its results without the need for an explicit retrieval

throughout the IGM. Taken at face value, this implies that the Hubble Law,
observed to be followed on scales which are deep inside the observed
hierarchical structures, can no longer be assumed to arise from universal
expansion. So, if not universal expansion, then what?
  As a possibility, it has been recognized for a considerable time that if the
lower cut-off scales of a $D \approx 2$ hierarchical cosmos are identified with
the scales of a typical galaxy, then gravitational redshift automatically
follows the Hubble Law with $H_g \approx 70\,km/sec/Mpc$. Inter alia, this
suggests a model of galaxy formation in a $D\approx2$ hierarchical IGM in which
all of the material $M_0$ within a sphere $R_0$ coalesces about a unique center
so that hierarchical symmetry is broken on the scale $(M_0,R_0)$.
  Putting these things together leads unambiguously to the conclusion that, in

optimization algorithms, called maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-fractional

(Max-SNR-EAR), are proposed to jointly design the beamforming vector and phase
shift matrix (PSM) of hybrid IRS by alternately optimizing one and giving
another. The former employs the successive convex approximation and FP methods
to derive the beamforming vector and hybrid IRS PSM, while the latter adopts
the maximum signal-to-leakage-noise ratio method and the criteria of phase
alignment and EAR to design them. Simulation results show that the rates
harvested by the proposed two methods are slightly lower than those of active
IRS with higher power consumption, which are 35 percent higher than those of no

Moreover, thanks to the possibility of measuring the polarization direction of
the photon based on Compton scattering, the predicted entanglement between the
linear polarization of annihilation photons in positronium decays can also be
studied. Recently, a new J-PET prototype was commissioned, based on a modular
design of detection units. Each module consists of 13 plastic scintillators and
can be used as a stand-alone, compact and portable detection unit. In this

two-coupled Kerr nonlinear resonators. Our results demonstrate that $n$-photon
bunching and $(n+1)$-photon antibunching can be simultaneously obtained in
these systems. This effect is due both to the anharmonic energy ladder and to
the nature of the $n$-photon drive. To show the importance of the drive, we
compare the results of the $n$-photon drive with a coherent (one-photon) drive,

  $\bf{Methods}$: We included 213 normal, 204 mild glaucoma (mean deviation
[MD] $\ge$ -6.00 dB), 118 moderate glaucoma (MD of -6.01 to -12.00 dB), and 118
advanced glaucoma patients (MD < -12.00 dB). All subjects had their ONHs imaged
in 3D with Spectralis optical coherence tomography. To describe the 3D
structural phenotype of glaucoma as a function of severity, we used two
different approaches: (1) We extracted human-defined 3D structural parameters
of the ONH including retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, lamina
cribrosa (LC) shape and depth at different stages of glaucoma; (2) we also
employed a geometric deep learning method (i.e. PointNet) to identify the most
important 3D structural features that differentiate ONHs from different
glaucoma severity groups without any human input.
  $\bf{Results}$: We observed that the majority of ONH structural changes
occurred in the early glaucoma stage, followed by a plateau effect in the later
stages. Using PointNet, we also found that 3D ONH structural changes were
present in both neural and connective tissues. In both approaches, we observed
that structural changes were more prominent in the superior and inferior
quadrant of the ONH, particularly in the RNFL, the prelamina, and the LC. As
the severity of glaucoma increased, these changes became more diffuse (i.e.
widespread), particularly in the LC.
  $\bf{Conclusions}$: In this study, we were able to uncover complex 3D
structural changes of the ONH in both neural and connective tissues as a
function of glaucoma severity. We hope to provide new insights into the complex
pathophysiology of glaucoma that might help clinicians in their daily clinical

promising platform of topological superconductivity (TSC) and Majorana zero

fundamental research and applications, SCTMs are very rare in nature. In
addition, some superconductors with topological electronic structures have been
reported recently, but a feasible program to determine their TSC properties is
still lacking. Here, we propose a new strategy to design SCTMs by intercalating
the superconducting units into the topological insulators. A program that
characterizes the superconducting BdG Chern number of 2D BdG Hamiltonian from
ab initio calculations is also developed. Following this strategy,
PdBi$_2$Te$_5$ and PdBi$_2$Te$_4$ are found to be experimentally synthesizable
and ideal SCTMs. Chiral TSC could be realized in such SCTMs by incorporating
topological surface states with Zeeman effect, which can be realized by an
external magnetic field or in proximity to ferromagnetic (FM) insulator. Our
strategy provides a new method for identifying the SCTMs and TSC candidates,
and the program makes it possible to design and modulate the TSC candidates
from ab initio calculations.

Conventionally, the interference is considered to be Gaussian-distributed and

results in degraded DOA estimation performance. Maximum likelihood DOA
estimation in the presence of non-Gaussian and spatially colored interference
is computationally complex and not practical. Therefore, this work proposes a

of unit-modulus for passive IRS phase shifts. To achieve high rate performance

to its extremely high complexity, a low-complexity method based on successive
convex approximation and FP (LC-SCA-FP) algorithm is put forward. To further
reduce the complexity, a lower-complexity method based on whitening filter,
general power iterative and generalized Rayleigh-Ritz (WF-GPI-GRR) is proposed,

hard X-ray (HXR) emission shows a good temporal and spatial correlation with
the white-light (WL) enhancement and the sunquake. Spectral analysis also
reveals a harder photon spectrum that extends to several hundred keV, implying
a considerable population of flare-accelerated nonthermal electrons at high
energies. Quantitatively, the total energy of electrons above 300 keV in
sunquake-active flares is systematically different from that in sunquake-quiet
flares, while the difference is marginal for electrons above 50 keV. All these
facts support highly energetic electrons as a preferred driver of the
sunquakes. Such an electron-driven scenario can be reasonably accommodated in
the framework of a recently proposed selection rule for sunquake generation.
For the remaining one event, the sunquake epicenter is cospatial with a
magnetic imprint, i.e., a permanent change of magnetic field on the
photosphere. Quantitative calculation shows that the flare-induced downward
Lorentz force can do enough work to power the sunquake, acting as a viable

efficiency, and flexible use. However, UAVs are often equipped with cheap POS
systems and non-measurement cameras, and their flight attitudes are easily
affected. How to realize the large-scale mapping of UAV image-free control
supported by POS faces many technical problems. The most basic and important
core technology is how to accurately realize the absolute orientation of images
through advanced aerial triangulation technology. In traditional aerial
triangulation, image matching algorithms are constrained to varying degrees by
preset prior knowledge. In recent years, deep learning has developed rapidly in
the field of photogrammetric computer vision. It has surpassed the performance
of traditional handcrafted features in many aspects. It has shown stronger
stability in image-based navigation and positioning tasks, especially it has
better resistance to unfavorable factors such as blur, illumination changes,
and geometric distortion. Based on the introduction of the key technologies of
aerial triangulation without image control points, this paper proposes a new
drone image registration method based on deep learning image features to solve
the problem of high mismatch rate in traditional methods. It adopts SuperPoint
as the feature detector, uses the superior generalization performance of CNN to
extract precise feature points from the UAV image, thereby achieving
high-precision aerial triangulation. Experimental results show that under the
same pre-processing and post-processing conditions, compared with the
traditional method based on the SIFT algorithm, this method achieves suitable
precision more efficiently, which can meet the requirements of UAV aerial
triangulation without image control points in large-scale surveys.

  arXiv:1904.03796",,,,"cs.DS cs.CG cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we study several important geometric optimization problems
arising in machine learning. First, we revisit the Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB)
problem in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. The problem has been extensively
studied before, but real-world machine learning tasks often need to handle
large-scale datasets so that we cannot even afford linear time algorithms.
Motivated by the recent studies on {\em beyond worst-case analysis}, we
introduce the notion of stability for MEB, which is natural and easy to
understand. Roughly speaking, an instance of MEB is stable, if the radius of
the resulting ball cannot be significantly reduced by removing a small fraction
of the input points. Under the stability assumption, we present two sampling
algorithms for computing radius-approximate MEB with sample complexities
independent of the number of input points $n$. In particular, the second
algorithm has the sample complexity even independent of the dimensionality $d$.
We also consider the general case without the stability assumption. We present
a hybrid algorithm that can output either a radius-approximate MEB or a
covering-approximate MEB. Our algorithm improves the running time and the
number of passes for the previous sublinear MEB algorithms. Our method relies
on two novel techniques, the Uniform-Adaptive Sampling method and Sandwich
Lemma. Furthermore, we observe that these two techniques can be generalized to
design sublinear time algorithms for a broader range of geometric optimization
problems with outliers in high dimensions, including MEB with outliers,
one-class and two-class linear SVMs with outliers, $k$-center clustering with
outliers, and flat fitting with outliers. Our proposed algorithms also work
fine for kernels.

adversely affect the semiconductor's local properties. A tunnel barrier
inserted at the interface could resolve this issue. We assess the wide band gap
semiconductor, CdTe, as a candidate material to mediate the coupling at the
lattice-matched interface between $\alpha$-Sn and InSb. To this end, we use
density functional theory (DFT) with Hubbard U corrections, whose values are
machine-learned via Bayesian optimization (BO) [npj Computational Materials 6,
180 (2020)]. The results of DFT+U(BO) are validated against angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments for $\alpha$-Sn and CdTe. For
CdTe, the z-unfolding method [Advanced Quantum Technologies, 5, 2100033 (2022)]
is used to resolve the contributions of different $k_z$ values to the ARPES. We
then study the band offsets and the penetration depth of metal-induced gap
states (MIGS) in bilayer interfaces of InSb/$\alpha$-Sn, InSb/CdTe, and
CdTe/$\alpha$-Sn, as well as in tri-layer interfaces of InSb/CdTe/$\alpha$-Sn

CdTe can serve as a tunnel barrier, effectively shielding the InSb from MIGS
from the $\alpha$-Sn. This may guide the choice of dimensions of the CdTe
barrier to mediate the coupling in semiconductor-superconductor devices in
future Majorana zero modes experiments.

close contact with individuals, an efficient way to prevent the spread is by
limiting the number of on-site employees in the workplace along with regular

model aims to derive optimal staff occupancy and testing strategies to minimize
the risk of infection among employees, while the second model aims at only
optimal staff occupancy under a random testing strategy. To solve the problems

``Service Requirement Elicitation (SRE)'' task. Considering the amount of
customers is huge, it is an inefficient way for service providers to interact

with the assistance of virtual intelligent assistants has become a mainstream
way. Since user requirements generally consist of different levels of details
and need to be satisfied by services from multiple domains, there is a huge
potential requirement space for SRE to explore to elicit complete requirements.
Considering that traditional dialogue system with static slots cannot be
directly applied to the SRE task, it is a challenge to design an efficient
dialogue strategy to guide users to express their complete and accurate
requirements in such a huge potential requirement space. Based on the
phenomenon that users tend to express requirements subjectively in a sequential

hydrogen storage in the form of metal hydrides, but there are still unresolved
problems with the kinetics and thermodynamics of hydrogenation and
dehydrogenation of this group of materials. Severe plastic deformation (SPD)
methods, such as equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP), high-pressure torsion
(HPT), intensive rolling and fast forging, have been widely used to enhance the
activation, air resistance, and hydrogenation/dehydrogenation kinetics of
Mg-based hydrogen storage materials by introducing ultrafine/nanoscale grains
and crystal lattice defects. These severely deformed materials, particularly in
the presence of alloying additives or second-phase nanoparticles, can show not
only fast hydrogen absorption/desorption kinetics but also good cycling
stability. It was shown that some materials that are apparently inert to
hydrogen can absorb hydrogen after SPD processing. Moreover, the SPD methods
were effectively used for hydrogen binding-energy engineering and synthesizing
new magnesium alloys with low thermodynamic stability for reversible
low/room-temperature hydrogen storage, such as nanoglasses, high-entropy
alloys, and metastable phases including the high-pressure {\gamma}-MgH2
polymorph. This article reviews recent advances in the development of Mg-based
hydrogen storage materials by SPD processing and discusses their potential in
future applications.

photocatalyst for photoreduction. The material had a chemical composition of
TiZrNbHfTaO$_6$N$_3$ and was produced by a high-pressure torsion method
followed by oxidation and nitriding. It showed higher photocatalytic CO$_2$ to
CO conversion compared to corresponding high-entropy oxide, benchmark
photocatalyst P25 TiO$_2$, and almost all catalysts introduced in the
literature. The high activity of this oxynitride, which also showed good
chemical stability, was attributed to the large absorbance of light and easy
separation of electrons and holes, the low recombination of charge carriers,
and the high CO$_2$ adsorption on the surface. These findings introduce
high-entropy oxynitrides as promising photocatalysts for CO$_2$ photoreduction.

photocatalysis, 10 different heterojunctions were simultaneously introduced in
the Ti-Zr-Nb-Ta-W-O system. The oxide, which was synthesized by a high-pressure
torsion method and oxidation, successfully produced oxygen from water under
visible light without co-catalyst addition. The photocatalytic performance was
attributed to high visible-light absorption, narrow bandgap, appropriate band
structure, presence of multiple heterojunctions and accordingly easy

the research topics of interest in recent years. Almost few studies have been
reported based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) in this area, but
their results are promising. GANs are powerful generative models successfully
applied in different areas but suffer from inherent challenges such as training
instability and mode collapse. Also, a primary concern is capturing
correlations in stock prices. Therefore, our challenges fall into two main
categories: capturing correlations and inherent problems of GANs. In this
paper, we have introduced a novel framework based on DRAGAN and feature
matching for stock price forecasting, which improves training stability and
alleviates mode collapse. We have employed windowing to acquire temporal
correlations by the generator. Also, we have exploited conditioning on
discriminator inputs to capture temporal correlations and correlations between
prices and features. Experimental results on data from several stocks indicate
that our proposed method outperformed long short-term memory (LSTM) as a
baseline method, also basic GANs and WGAN-GP as two different variants of GANs.

transitional objects) are characterized by a combination of energy dynamics and
chemical modification on both terrestrial and small solar system bodies. In
this context, the discovery of glycine amino acid in meteorites and comets has
led to a hypothesis that impacts by astronomical bodies could contribute to
delivery and polymerization of amino acids in the early Earth to generate
proteins as essential molecules for life. Besides the possibility of abiotic
polymerization of glycine, its decomposition by impacts could generate reactive
groups to form other essential organic biomolecules. In this study, the
high-pressure torsion (HPT) method, as a new platform for simulation of impacts
by small solar system bodies, was applied to glycine. In comparison with
high-pressure shock experiments, the HPT method simultaneously introduces high
pressure and deformation strain. It was found that glycine was not polymerized
in the experimental condition assayed, but partially decomposed to ethanol
under pressures of 1 and 6 GPa and shear strains of <120 m/m. The detection of
ethanol implies the inherent availability of remaining nitrogen-containing
groups, which can incorporate to the formation of other organic molecules at
the impact site. In addition, this finding highlights a possibility of the
origin of ethanol previously detected in comets.

  Decision Making",,,,,"cs.CY cs.AI cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Automated decision-making systems are being increasingly deployed and affect
the public in a multitude of positive and negative ways. Governmental and
private institutions use these systems to process information according to
certain human-devised rules in order to address social problems or
organizational challenges. Both research and real-world experience indicate
that the public lacks trust in automated decision-making systems and the
institutions that deploy them. The recreancy theorem argues that the public is
more likely to trust and support decisions made or influenced by automated
decision-making systems if the institutions that administer them meet their
fiduciary responsibility. However, often the public is never informed of how
these systems operate and resultant institutional decisions are made. A ``black
box'' effect of automated decision-making systems reduces the public's
perceptions of integrity and trustworthiness. The result is that the public
loses the capacity to identify, challenge, and rectify unfairness or the costs
associated with the loss of public goods or benefits.
  The current position paper defines and explains the role of fiduciary
responsibility within an automated decision-making system. We formulate an
automated decision-making system as a data science lifecycle (DSL) and examine
the implications of fiduciary responsibility within the context of the DSL.
Fiduciary responsibility within DSLs provides a methodology for addressing the
public's lack of trust in automated decision-making systems and the
institutions that employ them to make decisions affecting the public. We posit
that fiduciary responsibility manifests in several contexts of a DSL, each of
which requires its own mitigation of sources of mistrust. To instantiate
fiduciary responsibility, a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) predictive
policing case study is examined.

public-safety network (PSN), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and LTE-based
railway networks (LRN) needs a thorough investigation. UAVs are deployed as
mobile base stations (BSs) for cell-edge coverage enhancement for MU. The
co-existence of heterogeneous networks gives rise to the issue of co-channel
interference due to the utilization of the same frequency band. By considering
both sharing and non-sharing of radio access channels (RAC), we analyze
co-channel interference in the downlink system of PSN, UAV, and LRN. As the LRN
control signal demands high reliability and low latency, we provide higher
priority to LRN users when allocating resources from the LRN RAC shared with
MUs. Moreover, UAVs are deployed at the cell edge to increase the performance
of cell-edge users. Therefore, interference control techniques enable LRN, PSN,
and UAVs to cohabit in a scenario of sharing RAC. By offloading more PSN UEs to
the LRN or UAVs, the resource utilization of the LRN and UAVs BSs is enhanced.
In this paper, we aim to adopt deep learning (DL) based on enhanced
inter-cell-interference coordination (eICIC) and further enhanced ICIC (FeICIC)
strategies to deal with the interference from the PSN to the LRN and UAVs.
Among LRN, PSN BS, and UAVs, a DL-based coordinated multipoint (CoMP) link
technique is utilized to enhance the performance of PSN MUs. Therefore, if
radio access channels are shared, utilization of DL-based FeICIC and CoMP for
coordinated scheduling gives the best performance.

that the whole space is not only integer dimensions but also a superposition of
spaces between integer dimensions. Space-filling between integer dimensions
makes a fractional dimensional space. This happens through a rotation of the
integer dimension by the fractional derivative operator (local part) to sweep
all spaces between two integer dimensions. Then, we introduce four axioms which
they can help us to build a mathematical framework for study physics from
fractional dimension point of view. Afterward, three scenarios such as static,
linear and quadratic trajectories are demonstrated. Where moving with linear or
quadratic trajectories in fractional dimensional space corresponds to an
inertial framework or accelerated system in physics, respectively. Also from
this opinion, it is realized that the coupling of space and time (space-time)
happens through the dimension with an interconnection role where we call it
space-dimension-time. Finally, the wave equation is derived from fractional
dimensional point of view with a linear trajectory in fractional dimensional
space. And the behavior of electromagnetic wave in lossless and lossy mediums,
Doppler effect and gravitational red (blue)-shift are also demonstrated from
fractional dimensional aspect.

that for regular polygons with $\sigma= 6j$ sides (with $j=2,3,\dots$), $N(k)=3
k (k+1)+1$ (with $k=1,2,\dots$) congruent disks of appropriate size can be
nicely packed inside these polygons in highly symmetrical configurations which
apparently have maximal density for $N$ sufficiently small. These
configurations are invariant under rotations of $\pi/3$ and are closely related
to the configurations with perfect hexagonal packing in the regular hexagon and
to the configurations with {\sl curved hexagonal packing} (CHP) in the circle
found long time ago by Graham and Lubachevsky. At the basis of our explorations
are the algorithms that we have devised, which are very efficient in producing
the CHP and more general configurations inside regular polygons. We have used
these algorithms to generate a large number of CHP configurations for different
regular polygons and numbers of disks; a careful study of these results has
made possible to fully characterize the general properties of the CHP
configurations and to devise a {\sl deterministic} algorithm that completely
ensembles a given CHP configuration once an appropriate input (""DNA"") is
specified. Our analysis shows that the number of CHP configurations for a given
$N$ is highly degenerate in the packing fraction and it can be explicitly
calculated in terms of $k$ (number of shells), of the building block of the DNA
itself and of the number of vertices in the fundamental domain (because of the
symmetry we work in $1/6$ of the whole domain). With the help of our
deterministic algorithm we are able to build {\sl all} the CHP configurations
for a polygon with $k$ shells.

multiple targets when completing auxiliary tasks. However, indoor scenes are
usually complex and there are many types of interference factors, leading to
great challenges in the multiple targets detection. To overcome this technical
difficulty, a novel improved Mask RCNN method for multiple targets detection in
the indoor complex scenes is proposed in this paper. The improved model
utilizes Mask RCNN as the network framework. On this basis, Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) with channel mechanism and space mechanism is
integrated, and the influence of different background, distance, angle and
interference factors are comprehensively considered. Meanwhile, in order to
evaluate the detection and identification effects of the established model, a
comprehensive evaluation system based on loss function and Mean Average
Precision (mAP) is established. For verification, experiments on the detection
and identification effects under different distances, backgrounds, angles and
interference factors were conducted. The results show that designed model
improves the accuracy to a higher level and has a better anti-interference
ability than other methods when the detection speed was nearly the same.

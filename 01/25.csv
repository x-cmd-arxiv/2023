  Communicating With Artificial Intelligence Through Legal Standards","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2209.13020",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is taking on increasingly autonomous roles,
e.g., browsing the web as a research assistant and managing money. But
specifying goals and restrictions for AI behavior is difficult. Similar to how
parties to a legal contract cannot foresee every potential ""if-then""
contingency of their future relationship, we cannot specify desired AI behavior
for all circumstances. Legal standards facilitate robust communication of
inherently vague and underspecified goals. Instructions (in the case of
language models, ""prompts"") that employ legal standards will allow AI agents to
develop shared understandings of the spirit of a directive that generalize
expectations regarding acceptable actions to take in unspecified states of the
world. Standards have built-in context that is lacking from other goal
specification languages, such as plain language and programming languages.
Through an empirical study on thousands of evaluation labels we constructed
from U.S. court opinions, we demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) are
beginning to exhibit an ""understanding"" of one of the most relevant legal
standards for AI agents: fiduciary obligations. Performance comparisons across
models suggest that, as LLMs continue to exhibit improved core capabilities,
their legal standards understanding will also continue to improve. OpenAI's
latest LLM has 78% accuracy on our data, their previous release has 73%
accuracy, and a model from their 2020 GPT-3 paper has 27% accuracy (worse than
random). Our research is an initial step toward a framework for evaluating AI
understanding of legal standards more broadly, and for conducting reinforcement
learning with legal feedback (RLLF).

that $\mu$ is uniformly completely mixing if the powers of the operator
$\lambda_1^0(\mu)$ converge uniformly to 0.
  We completely characterize the uniform mean ergodicity of the operator
$\lambda_1(\mu)$ and the uniform convergence of its powers and see that there

The last of these three conditions is actually equivalent to $\mu$ being
spread-out (some convolution power of $\mu$ is not singular). The measure $\mu$
is uniformly completely mixing if and only if $G$ is compact, $\mu$ is
spread-out and the only unimodular value of the spectrum of $\mu$ is 1.

good stability and accuracy because of the use of symplectic methods for

conducted to validate and compare the two discretizations.

techniques that can process large numbers of points over large field of views.
Today, most deep networks designed for this task exploit 3D sparse convolutions
to reduce memory and computational loads. The best methods then further exploit
specificities of rotating lidar sampling patterns to further improve the
performance, e.g., cylindrical voxels, or range images (for feature fusion from
multiple point cloud representations). In contrast, we show that one can build
a well-performing point-based backbone free of these specialized tools. This
backbone, WaffleIron, relies heavily on generic MLPs and dense 2D convolutions,
making it easy to implement, and contains just a few parameters easy to tune.
Despite its simplicity, our experiments on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes show that
WaffleIron competes with the best methods designed specifically for these
autonomous driving datasets. Hence, WaffleIron is a strong, easy-to-implement,
baseline for semantic segmentation of sparse outdoor point clouds.

This new version of the self-consistent method of moments invokes up to nine
sum rules and other exact relations involving the spectral density, the
two-parameter Shannon information entropy maximization procedure, and the ab
initio path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations which provide crucial
reliable input information on the system static properties. Detailed analysis
of the dispersion relations of collective excitations, the modes decrements and
the static structure factor (SSF) of $^3$He at the saturated vapor pressure is
performed. The results are compared to available experimental data~[1,2]. The
theory reveals a clear signature of the roton-like feature in the particle-hole
segment of the excitation spectrum with a significant reduction of the roton
decrement in the wavenumber range $1.3 A^{-1} \leq q\leq 2.2 A^{-1}$. The
observed roton mode remains a well defined collective excitation even in the
particle-hole band, where, however, it is strongly damped. Hence, the existence
of the roton-like mode in the bulk liquid $^3$He is confirmed like in other
strongly interacting quantum fluids~[3]. The phonon branch of the spectrum is
also studied with a reasonable agreement with the same experimental data being

Telescope (GBT) we observe 3 emission lines of HC$_3$N, 9 lines of HC$_5$N, 5
lines of HC$_7$N, and 9 lines of HC$_9$N. HC$_9$N is detected for the first
time towards the source. The high spectral resolution ($\sim$ 0.05 km s$^{-1}$)
reveals double-peak spectral line profiles with the redshifted peak a factor
3-5 brighter. Resolved maps of the core in other molecular tracers indicates
that the southern region is redshifted. Therefore, the bulk of the cyanopolyyne
emission is likely associated with the southern region of the core, where free
carbon atoms are available to form long chains, thanks to the more efficient
illumination of the interstellar field radiation.
  We perform a simultaneous modelling of the HC$_5$N, HC$_7$N, and HC$_9$N
lines, to investigate the origin of the emission. To enable this analysis, we
performed new calculation of the collisional coefficients. The simultaneous
fitting indicates a gas kinetic temperature of 5--12 K, a source size of
80$\arcsec$, and a gas density larger than 100 cm$^{-3}$. The
HC$_5$N:HC$_7$N:HC$_9$N abundance ratios measured in L1544 are about 1:6:4. We
compare our observations with those towards the the well-studied starless core
TMC-1 and with the available measurements in different star-forming regions.
The comparison suggests that a complex carbon chain chemistry is active in
other sources and it is related to the presence of free gaseous carbon.
Finally, we discuss the possible formation and destruction routes in the light

materials which in addition to having an easy-to-exfoliate layered structure,
also host semiconducting, metallic, superconducting, and topological properties
in various polymorphs with potential applications. MoTe$_2$ is an example of
such a TMD, which shows semiconducting (in 2H phase), metallic (in 1T' phase),
topological Weyl semimetallic and superconducting behavior (in Td phase).
Consequently, an extensive amount of research has been done on MoTe$_2$,
particularly on the topological phase transition between the metallic-type 1T'
phase and the topological Td phase. This phase transition has been reviewed and
its association with the crystal structure, charge transport, and electronic
band structure is elaborately discussed. Also, the effect of various stimuli
like reduced dimensionality, pressure, charge doping, and chemical
substitution, which affect the structural transition as well as the
superconducting transition temperatures is reviewed; thereby, suggesting
certain correlations between the apparently unrelated structural and
superconducting phase transitions. The review also brings out some open
questions which are likely to interest the community to address the physics

an essential component of building lifelong reinforcement learning agents.
However, the common practice in model-based reinforcement learning is to learn
models that model every aspect of the agent's environment, regardless of
whether they are important in coming up with optimal decisions or not. In this
paper, we argue that such models are not particularly well-suited for
performing scalable and robust planning in lifelong reinforcement learning
scenarios and we propose new kinds of models that only model the relevant
aspects of the environment, which we call ""minimal value-equivalent partial

theoretical results demonstrating the scalability advantages of performing
planning with such models and then perform experiments to empirically
illustrate our theoretical results. Then, we provide some useful heuristics on
how to learn these kinds of models with deep learning architectures and
empirically demonstrate that models learned in such a way can allow for
performing planning that is robust to distribution shifts and compounding model

minimal value-equivalent partial models can provide significant benefits to

measured in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV in different topological
regions. Particle transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) spectra are measured in the
``toward'', ``transverse'', and ``away'' angular regions defined with respect
to the direction of the leading particle in the event. While the toward and
away regions contain the fragmentation products of the near-side and away-side
jets, respectively, the transverse region is dominated by particles from the
Underlying Event (UE). The relative transverse activity classifier, $R_{\rm T}
= N_{\rm T} / \langle N_{\rm T} \rangle$, is used to group events according to
their UE activity, where $N_{\rm T}$ is the measured charged-particle
multiplicity per event in the transverse region and $\langle N_{\rm T} \rangle$
is the mean value over all the analysed events. The first measurements of
identified particle $p_{\rm T}$ spectra as a function of $R_{\rm T}$ in the
three topological regions are reported. The yield of high transverse momentum
particles relative to the $R_{\rm T}$-integrated measurement decreases with
increasing $R_{\rm T}$ in both the toward and away regions, indicating that the
softer UE dominates particle production as $R_{\rm T}$ increases and validating
that $R_{\rm T}$ can be used to control the magnitude of the UE. Conversely,
the spectral shapes in the transverse region harden significantly with
increasing $R_{\rm T}$. This hardening follows a mass ordering, being more
significant for heavier particles. The $p_{\rm T}$-differential particle ratios
$({\rm p + \overline{p}})/(\pi^+ + \pi^-)$ and $({\rm K^+ + K^-})/(\pi^+ +
\pi^-)$ in the low UE limit $(R_{\rm T} \rightarrow 0)$ approach expectations
from Monte Carlo generators such as PYTHIA 8 and EPOS LHC, where the

  February 2023",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Future collaborative robots must be capable of finding objects. As such a
fundamental skill, we expect object search to eventually become an
off-the-shelf capability for any robot, similar to e.g., object detection,
SLAM, and motion planning. However, existing approaches either make unrealistic
compromises (e.g., reduce the problem from 3D to 2D), resort to ad-hoc, greedy
search strategies, or attempt to learn end-to-end policies in simulation that
are yet to generalize across real robots and environments. This thesis argues
that through using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to
model object search while exploiting structures in the human world (e.g.,
octrees, correlations) and in human-robot interaction (e.g., spatial language),
a practical and effective system for generalized object search can be achieved.
In support of this argument, I develop methods and systems for (multi-)object
search in 3D environments under uncertainty due to limited field of view,
occlusion, noisy, unreliable detectors, spatial correlations between objects,
and possibly ambiguous spatial language (e.g., ""The red car is behind Chase
Bank""). Besides evaluation in simulators such as PyGame, AirSim, and AI2-THOR,
I design and implement a robot-independent, environment-agnostic system for
generalized object search in 3D and deploy it on the Boston Dynamics Spot
robot, the Kinova MOVO robot, and the Universal Robots UR5e robotic arm, to
perform object search in different environments. The system enables, for
example, a Spot robot to find a toy cat hidden underneath a couch in a kitchen
area in under one minute. This thesis also broadly surveys the object search
literature, proposing taxonomies in object search problem settings, methods and
systems.

gives rise to a weakly fillable contact structure. We show that this happens if
and only if $Y$ itself is weakly fillable, and $K$ is isotopic to the boundary
of a properly embedded symplectic disk inside a filling of $Y$. Moreover, if
$Y'$ is a contact manifold arising from positive contact surgery along $K$,
then any filling of $Y'$ is symplectomorphic to the complement of a suitable
neighborhood of such a disk in a filling of $Y$.
  Using this result we deduce several necessary conditions for a knot in the
standard 3-sphere to admit a fillable positive surgery, such as quasipositivity
and equality between the slice genus and the 4-dimensional clasp number, and we
give a characterization of such knots in terms of a quasipositive braid
expression. We show that knots arising as the closure of a positive braid
always admit a fillable positive surgery, as do knots that have lens space
surgeries, and suitable satellites of such knots. In fact the majority of
quasipositive knots with up to 10 crossings admit a fillable positive surgery.
On the other hand, in general (strong) quasipositivity, positivity, or
Lagrangian fillability need not imply a knot admits a fillable positive contact
surgery.

separate blood cells such as $RBCs$, $WBCs$, and platelets from plasma or

laboratories, the factors that affect the efficacy of the centrifugation
process have never been studied analytically. In this paper, we examine the
effect of the centrifugation time on the efficacy of the centrifugation process
by studying the dynamics of the blood cells via the well-known Langevin
equation or equivalently, by solving the Fokker-Plank equation. Our result
depicts that the speed of the centrifuge is one of the determinant factors
concerning the efficacy of the centrifugation process. As the angular speed
increases, the centrifugal force steps up and as result, the particles are
forced to separate from the plasma or serum. The room temperature also
considerably affects the dynamics of analyse during centrifugation. Most
importantly, the generation of heat during centrifugation steps up the
temperature within a centrifuge and as a result, not only the stability of the
sample but also mobility of analyse is affected. We show that as the centrifuge
temperature steps up, the velocity of the cells as well as the displacement of
the cell in the fluid decreases. We then study the dynamics of the whole blood
during capillary action where in this case the blood flows upward in a narrow
space without the assistance of external forces. Previous investigations show
that the height that the fluid rises increases as the surface tension steps up.

binary's formation channel and are imprinted in the binary's gravitational wave
signal. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian model selection method to
determine the preferred spin morphology of a detected binary black hole. The
method involves a fast calculation of the morphology which allows us to
restrict to a specific morphology in the Bayesian stochastic sampling. We
investigate the prospects for distinguishing between the different morphologies
using gravitational waves in the Advanced LIGO/Advanced Virgo network with
their plus-era sensitivities. For this, we consider fiducial high- and low-mass
binaries having different spin magnitudes and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We
find that in the cases with high spin and high SNR, the true morphology is
strongly favored with $\log_{10}$ Bayes factors $\gtrsim 4$ compared to both
alternative morphologies when the binary's parameters are not close to the
boundary between morphologies. However, when the binary parameters are close to
the boundary between morphologies, only one alternative morphology is strongly
disfavored. In the low-spin or low-SNR cases, the true morphology is still
favored with a $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor $\sim 2$ compared to one alternative
morphology. We also consider the gravitational wave signal from GW200129_065458

good can quantum information be transmitted or corrected when subjected to
noise. However, it is generally not known how to compute such quantities, since
the quantum channel coherent information is not additive for all channels,
implying that it must be maximized over an unbounded number of channel uses.
This leads to the phenomenon known as superadditivity, which refers to the fact
that the regularized coherent information of $n$ channel uses exceeds one-shot
coherent information. In this article, we study how the gain in quantum
capacity of qudit depolarizing channels relates to the dimension of the systems
considered. We make use of an argument based on the no-cloning bound in order
to proof that the possible superadditive effects decrease as a function of the
dimension for such family of channels. In addition, we prove that the capacity
of the qudit depolarizing channel coincides with the coherent information when
$d\rightarrow\infty$. We also discuss the private classical capacity and obain
similar results. We conclude that when high dimensional qudits experiencing
depolarizing noise are considered, the coherent information of the channel is
not only an achievable rate but essentially the maximum possible rate for any

XZX+YZY and XZY-YZX types. We solve the model exactly and obtain the ground
state phase diagram as a function of the two three-spin coupling strengths. We
show that even in absence of external electric and magnetic fields there is a
phase which exhibits spontaneous magnetoelectric order when both XZX+YZY and
XZY-YZX interactions are present. Specifically, in this regime, we show that
there exists not only a non-zero magnetization and a scalar chirality but also
a vector chiral order. Further, we show the existence of a plaquette vector
chirality, or circulating chiral spin current loops, in the plaquettes n, n+1,
n+2 with the sense of the current being opposite in adjacent plaquettes.
Analogous to charge current loops giving rise to orbital magnetic dipole
moments, the circulating spin current loops give rise to orbital electric
dipole moments - a novel orbital antiferroelectricity. We characterize this
phase by a higher-dimensional scalar and vector toroidal order. Such a novel
phase with higher dimensional order arises because of the non-trivial
topological connectivity resulting from the presence of both the three-spin
interactions. We also study the combined effect of both types of three-spin
interactions on the entanglement entropy.

per transaction if each transaction spends no more that a small fraction of a

non-adaptive adversary, these systems can be used to allow up to $k_1$
transactions to be validated concurrently and asynchronously but prevent more

these systems can be used to allow $k_1$ transaction to be validated and
prevent more than $k'_2 > k_2$ transactions from being validated, the
difference $k'_2-k_2$ being dependent on the quorum system's {\em validation
slack}, which we define in this paper. Using $(k_1,k_2)$-quorum systems, a
payer can execute multiple partial spending transactions to spend a portion of
its initial balance with less than full quorum validation (less than $f$
validations per transaction) then reclaim any remaining funds using one fully
validated transaction, which we call a {\em settlement} transaction.

circular cylinder is investigated through particle image velocimetry (PIV)
data. Different ``flavours'' of freestream turbulence, in which the turbulence
intensity and integral length scale are independently varied, are subjected to
the cylinder. The time-averaged spreading of the near wake is decoupled into
the growth through entrainment and the envelope of the spatial extent of the
instantaneous wake due to wake ``meandering'', induced by the presence of
large-scale coherent structures, i.e. the von Karman vortex street. Unlike for
the far field of a turbulent wake, examined by Kankanwadi and Buxton (2020), it
is shown that freestream turbulence enhances the entrainment rate into the wake
in comparison to a non-turbulent background. Both the turbulence intensity and
the integral length scale of the background turbulence are important in this
regard, contrasting to the far wake where only the turbulence intensity is
important. Additionally, wake meandering is enhanced by the presence of
background turbulence, and here the integral length scale is the dominant
parameter. Combining these findings yields the oft-reported result that
background turbulence enhances the time-averaged near-wake growth rate. The
influence of wake meandering is isolated by conducting similar experiments in
which a splitter plate is mounted to the rear face of the cylinder, thereby
eliminating the von Karman vortex street. These results show that when
large-scale vortices aren't present within the turbulent wake then freestream
turbulence actually suppresses the entrainment rate, relative to a
non-turbulent background, in results that mirror Kankanwadi and Buxton (2020).
We therefore postulate that freestream turbulence has the effect to enhance
large-scale entrainment via engulfment, but suppress entrainment via
small-scale nibbling.

The constant $C$ comes from the use of the regularity lemma, and has a tower
type dependence on $k$. In this paper we significantly improve these bounds,
showing that $\hat{r}_\text{ind}^k(C_n)\leq O(k^{102})n$ when $n$ is even, thus
obtaining only a polynomial dependence of $C$ on $k$. We also prove
$\hat{r}_\text{ind}^k(C_n)\leq e^{O(k\log k)}n$ for odd $n$, which almost
matches the lower bound of $e^{\Omega(k)}n$. Finally, we show that the ordinary

transfer or inversion of populations in quantum systems. Landau and Zener
accurately estimated the transfer probability of ARP for a closed system and
showed that this probability improved with higher drive amplitude. Recently, we
have found that in open quantum systems, applying a strong drive can give rise
to significant drive-induced dissipation (DID). Here, we investigate the effect
of DID on the performance of ARP that is implemented using a linearly chirped
pulse on a two-level system. From the Landau-Zener formula, the population
transfer was known to be enhanced with increasing drive amplitude. However,
here we show that beyond a threshold value of the drive amplitude, the transfer
probability is reduced because of the detrimental effect of DID. We show that
the competition between the two processes results in an optimal behavior of the
population transfer. We also propose a phenomenological model that helps
explain such nonmonotonic behavior of the transfer. Using this model, we
estimate the optimum time at which the maximum population transfer occurs. We
extend the analysis for rectangular as well as Gaussian pulse profiles and
conclude that a Gaussian pulse outperforms a rectangular pulse.

existing methods struggle to produce realistic images that have accurate nuclei

tasks. To address the challenges, we propose a novel approach that enhances the
quality of synthetic images by using nuclei topology and contour
regularization. The proposed approach uses the skeleton map of nuclei to
integrate nuclei topology and separate touching nuclei. In the loss function,
we propose two new contour regularization terms that enhance the contrast
between contour and non-contour pixels and increase the similarity between
contour pixels. We evaluate the proposed approach on the two datasets using
image quality metrics and a downstream task (nuclei segmentation). The proposed
approach outperforms Sharp-GAN in all four image quality metrics on two
datasets. By integrating 6k synthetic images from the proposed approach into
training, a nuclei segmentation model achieves the state-of-the-art
segmentation performance on TNBC dataset and its detection quality (DQ),

ejecta on galactic scale which is specifically tailored to complement the

measurements in the MeV range, in particular for decay gamma-rays such as
$^{26}$Al, $^{60}$Fe or $^{44}$Ti. Based on properties of massive star groups,
we developed a Population Synthesis Code which can instantiate galaxy models
quickly and based on many different parameter configurations, such as the star
formation rate, density profiles, or stellar evolution models. As a result, we
obtain model maps of nucleosynthesis ejecta in the Galaxy which incorporate the
population synthesis calculations of individual massive star groups. Based on a
variety of stellar evolution models, supernova explodabilities, and density
distributions, we find that the measured $^{26}$Al distribution from
INTEGRAL/SPI can be explained by a Galaxy-wide population synthesis model with
a star formation rate of $4$-$8\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$ and a spiral-arm
dominated density profile with a scale height of at least 700 pc. Our model
requires that most massive stars indeed undergo a supernova explosion. This
corresponds to a supernova rate in the Milky Way of $1.8$-$2.8$ per century,
with quasi-persistent $^{26}$Al and $^{60}$Fe masses of

series classification (TSC) is the task of assigning a time series to one of a
set of predefined classes, usually based on a model learned from examples.
Dictionary-based methods for TSC rely on counting the frequency of certain
patterns in time series and are important components of the currently most
accurate TSC ensembles. One of the early dictionary-based methods was WEASEL,
which at its time achieved SotA results while also being very fast. However, it
is outperformed both in terms of speed and accuracy by other methods.
Furthermore, its design leads to an unpredictably large memory footprint,
making it inapplicable for many applications.
  In this paper, we present WEASEL 2.0, a complete overhaul of WEASEL based on
two recent advancements in TSC: Dilation and ensembling of randomized
hyper-parameter settings. These two techniques allow WEASEL 2.0 to work with a
fixed-size memory footprint while at the same time improving accuracy. Compared
to 15 other SotA methods on the UCR benchmark set, WEASEL 2.0 is significantly
more accurate than other dictionary methods and not significantly worse than
the currently best methods. Actually, it achieves the highest median accuracy
over all data sets, and it performs best in 5 out of 12 problem classes. We
thus believe that WEASEL 2.0 is a viable alternative for current TSC and also a

properties of biological membranes. An essential feature of intelligent
transport is the ability to adapt to different external and internal conditions
and also the ability to memorise the previous state. In biological systems, the
most common form of such intelligence is expressed as hysteresis. Despite
numerous advances made over previous decades on smart membranes, it is still a
challenge for a synthetic membrane to display stable hysteretic behaviour for
molecular transport. Here we show the memory effects and stimuli regulated
transport of molecules through an intelligent phase changing MoS$_2$ membrane
in response to external pH. We show that water and ion permeation through 1T'
MoS$_2$ membranes follows a pH dependent hysteresis with a permeation rate that
switches by a few orders of magnitude. We demonstrate that this phenomenon is
unique to the 1T' phase of MoS$_2$ due to the presence of surface charge and
exchangeable ions on the surface. We further demonstrate the potential
application of this phenomenon in autonomous wound infection monitoring and
pH-dependent nanofiltration. Our work significantly deepens understanding of

features dispersionless states (i.e., flat bands) throughout its Brillouin

amount of DM in compact objects ($f_p$) of 0.50 at 95\% confidence level
(C.L.), in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model and 0.49 when marginalising over a
constant dark energy equation of state. These limits do not change when
marginalising over cosmic curvature, demonstrating the robustness to the
cosmological model. When allowing for the prior on $\eta$ to include $\eta >
1$, we derive $f_p < 0.32$ at 95$\%$ C.L., showing that the prior assumption of
$\eta \leq 1$ gives a conservative upper limit on $f_p$. When including Cepheid
calibrated supernovae, the 95\% C.L. constraints improve to $f_p < 0.25$. We
find that the estimate for the Hubble constant in our inference is consistent
with the homogeneous case, showing that inhomogeneities in the form of compact
dark matter cannot account for the observed Hubble tension. In conclusion, we
strongly exclude the possibility that PBHs with stellar masses and above form a
dominant fraction of the dark matter.

generalize this rule by introducing a weight factor to compare the payoff

always hinders cooperation under weak selection strength. Surprisingly, the
results show a non-trivial tipping point of the weight factor where the
threshold of cooperation success shifts from positive to negative infinity.
Once focal weight exceeds this tipping point, cooperation becomes unreachable.
Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations on a

either by multiple direct sound events or by a diffuse reverberant sound field.
More recently, a specific attribute for the sensation of being covered by sound

listener engulfment. This contribution investigates the effect of the temporal
and directional density of sound events on listener envelopment and engulfment.
A spatial granular synthesis technique is used to precisely control the
temporal and directional density of sound events. Experimental results indicate
that a directionally uniform distribution of sound events at time intervals
$\Delta t < 20$ milliseconds is required to elicit a sensation of diffuse
envelopment, whereas longer time intervals lead to localized auditory events.
It shows that elevated loudspeaker layers do not increase envelopment, but
contribute specifically to listener engulfment. Lowpass-filtered stimuli
increase envelopment, but lead to a decreased control over engulfment. The
results can be exploited in the technical design and creative application of
spatial sound synthesis and reverberation algorithms.

We construct a unified theoretical framework for calculating the outgassing
chemistry of both secondary and hybrid atmospheres, where the input parameters
are the surface pressure, oxidation and sulfidation states of the mantle, as
well as the primordial atmospheric hydrogen, helium and nitrogen content.
Non-ideal gases (quantified by the fugacity coefficient) and non-ideal mixing
of gaseous components (quantified by the activity coefficient) are considered.
Both secondary and hybrid atmospheres exhibit a rich diversity of chemistries,
including hydrogen-dominated atmospheres. The abundance ratio of carbon dioxide
to carbon monoxide serves as a powerful diagnostic for the oxygen fugacity of
the mantle, which may conceivably be constrained by James Webb Space Telescope
spectra in the near future. Methane-dominated atmospheres are difficult to

exceeding $\sim 10$ bar, a reduced (poorly oxidised) mantle and diminished

Mercury. There are currently no hypotheses for the origin of this ring in the
literature, so we explore four different origin scenarios here: the dust
originated from (1) the sporadic meteoroid complex that comprises the major
portion of the Zodiacal Cloud, (2) recent asteroidal/cometary activity, (3)
hypothetical dust-generating bodies locked in mean-motion resonances beyond
Mercury, and (4) bodies co-orbiting with Mercury. We find that only scenario
(4) reproduces the observed structure and location of Mercury's dust ring.
However, the lifetimes of Mercury's co-orbitals (<20 Ma) preclude the
primordial origin of the co-orbiting source population due to dynamical
instability and meteoroid bombardment, demanding a recent event feeding the
observed dust ring.
  We find that an impact on Mercury can eject debris into the co-orbital
resonance. We estimate the ages of six candidate impacts that formed craters
larger than 40 km in diameter using high-resolution spacecraft data from
MESSENGER and find two craters with estimated surface ages younger than 50 Ma.
We find that the amount of mass transported from Mercury's surface into the
co-orbital resonance from these two impacts is several orders of magnitude
smaller than what is needed to explain the magnitude of Mercury's ring inferred
from remote sensing. Therefore we suggest that numerous younger, smaller
impacts collectively contributed to the origin of the ring. We conclude that
the recent impact hypothesis for the origin of Mercury's dust ring is a viable
scenario, whose validity can be constrained by future inner solar system
missions.

recent advances in computer vision show that vision transformers (ViTs) have

we question if projection-based methods for 3D semantic segmentation can
benefit from these latest improvements on ViTs. We answer positively but only
after combining them with three key ingredients: (a) ViTs are notoriously hard
to train and require a lot of training data to learn powerful representations.
By preserving the same backbone architecture as for RGB images, we can exploit
the knowledge from long training on large image collections that are much
cheaper to acquire and annotate than point clouds. We reach our best results
with pre-trained ViTs on large image datasets. (b) We compensate ViTs' lack of
inductive bias by substituting a tailored convolutional stem for the classical
linear embedding layer. (c) We refine pixel-wise predictions with a
convolutional decoder and a skip connection from the convolutional stem to
combine low-level but fine-grained features of the the convolutional stem with
the high-level but coarse predictions of the ViT encoder. With these
ingredients, we show that our method, called RangeViT, outperforms existing

quasi-monochromatic, persistent gravitational-wave signals from neutron stars,
to determine whether unresolved millisecond pulsars could actually explain this

millisecond pulsars required to explain the observed excess. Then, we consider
two models for deformations on millisecond pulsars to determine their
ellipticity distributions, which are directly related to their
gravitational-wave radiation. Lastly, based on null results from the
Frequency-Hough all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves, we find that
a large set of the parameter space in the pulsar luminosity function can be

approximately perpendicular to the line of sight, which suggests repolarization

that the median chemical lifetime of H2 is just 4 Myr, independent of the
lifetime of its host molecular cloud, which may vary from 1 to 90 Myr, with a
substantial portion of all star formation in the galaxy occurring in relatively
long-lived clouds. The rapid ejection of gas from around young massive stars by
early stellar feedback is responsible for this short H2 survival time, driving
down the density of the surrounding gas, so that its H2 molecules are
dissociated by the interstellar radiation field. This ejection of gas from the
H2-dominated state is balanced by the constant accretion of new gas from the
galactic environment, constituting a ""competition model"" for molecular cloud
evolution. Gas ejection occurs at a rate that is proportional to the molecular
cloud mass, so that the cloud lifetime is determined by the accretion rate,
which may be as high as 4 x 10^4 Msol/Myr in the longest-lived clouds. Our
findings therefore resolve the conflict between observations of rapid gas
ejection around young massive stars and observations of long-lived molecular
clouds in galaxies, that often survive up to several tens of Myr. We show that
the fastest-accreting, longest-lived, highest-mass clouds drive supernova
clustering on sub-cloud scales, which in turn is a key driver of galactic

an azimuthal asymmetry (e.g., a hot spot), superimposed on the stochastic

(1) The properties of the CGM depend on a competition between gravity-driven
infall and gas cooling. When cooling is slow relative to free fall, the gas is
hot (roughly virial temperature) whereas the gas is cold (T~10^4 K) when
cooling is rapid. (2) Gas inflows and outflows play crucial roles, as does the
cosmological environment. Large-scale structure collimates cold streams and
provides angular momentum. Satellite galaxies contribute to the CGM through
winds and gas stripping. (3) In multiphase gas, the hot and cold phases
continuously exchange mass, energy and momentum. The interaction between
turbulent mixing and radiative cooling is critical. A broad spectrum of cold
gas structures, going down to sub-pc scales, arises from fragmentation,
coagulation, and condensation onto gas clouds. (4) Magnetic fields, thermal
conduction and cosmic rays can substantially modify how the cold and hot phases
interact, although microphysical uncertainties are presently large. Key open
questions for future work include the mutual interplay between small-scale
structure and large-scale dynamics, and how the CGM affects the evolution of

observations of the afterglow of GRB 180720B, GRB 190114C, and GRB 221009A to
investigate whether the bursts exhibiting VHE emission share common features.
We assume the standard afterglow model and microphysical parameters consistent
with a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scenario for the VHE radiation. By
requiring that the blastwave should be transparent to $\gamma$-$\gamma$ pair
production at the time of observation of the VHE photons and relying on typical
prompt emission efficiencies and data in the radio, optical and X-ray bands, we
infer for those bursts that the initial energy of the blastwave is
$\tilde{E}_{k, \rm{iso}} \gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10^{54})$ erg and the circumburst
density is $n_0 \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$ cm$^{-3}$ for a constant

Cherenkov Telescope Array has the potential to provide crucial insight in this
context by detecting a larger sample of VHE GRBs. In addition, due to the very

role as the mediator of a fundamental interaction, which is expected to acquire
nonclassical features, and its role in determining the properties of spacetime,
which is inherently classical. Fundamentally, this tension should result in
breaking one of the fundamental principles of quantum theory or general
relativity, but it is usually hard to assess which one without resorting to a
specific model. Here, we answer this question in a theory-independent way using
General Probabilistic Theories (GPTs). We consider the interactions of the
gravitational field with a single matter system, and derive a no-go theorem
showing that when gravity is classical at least one of the following
assumptions needs to be violated: (i) Matter degrees of freedom are described
by fully non-classical degrees of freedom; (ii) Interactions between matter
degrees of freedom and the gravitational field are reversible; (iii) Matter
degrees of freedom back-react on the gravitational field. We argue that this
implies that theories of classical gravity and quantum matter must be
fundamentally irreversible, as is the case in the recent model of Oppenheim et
al. Conversely if we require that the interaction between quantum matter and
the gravitational field are reversible, then the gravitational field must be
non-classical.

rare fluctuations of time-averaged observables, opening new avenues of research
in nonequilibrium physics. One of the most appealing results within this
context are dynamical phase transitions (DPTs), which might occur at the level
of trajectories in order to maximize the probability of sustaining a rare
event. While the Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory has underpinned much recent
progress on the understanding of symmetry-breaking DPTs in driven diffusive
systems, their microscopic characterization is still challenging. In this work
we shed light on the general spectral mechanism giving rise to continuous DPTs
not only for driven diffusive systems, but for any jump process in which a
discrete $\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry is broken. By means of a symmetry-aided
spectral analysis of the Doob-transformed dynamics, we provide the conditions
whereby symmetry-breaking DPTs might emerge and how the different dynamical
phases arise from the specific structure of the degenerate eigenvectors. We
show explicitly how all symmetry-breaking features are encoded in the
subleading eigenvectors of the degenerate manifold. Moreover, by partitioning
configuration space into equivalence classes according to a proper order
parameter, we achieve a substantial dimensional reduction which allows for the
quantitative characterization of the spectral fingerprints of DPTs. We
illustrate our predictions in three paradigmatic many-body systems: (i) the 1D
boundary-driven weakly asymmetric exclusion process (WASEP), which exhibits a
particle-hole symmetry-breaking DPT for current fluctuations, (ii) the $3$ and
$4$-state Potts model, which displays discrete rotational symmetry-breaking DPT
for energy fluctuations, and (iii) the closed WASEP which presents a continuous
symmetry-breaking DPT to a time-crystal phase characterized by a rotating
condensate.

with sufficiently high spatial resolutions down to $\sim 1 \ {\rm pc}$ scale.
While previous studies only follow the evolution for a short period after the
primordial cloud collapse, we follow the long-term evolution until the cold

cold accretion emerges when the halo mass exceeds $\sim 2.2\times 10^7 \ {\rm

masses above which the accretion flow penetrates halos. We further continue
simulations to study whether the cold accretion provides the dense shock waves,
which have been proposed to give birth to supermassive stars (SMSs). We find
that the accretion flow eventually hits a compact disc near the halo centre,
creating dense shocks over a wide area of the disc surface. The resulting
post-shock gas becomes dense and hot enough with its mass comparable to the
Jeans mass $M_{\rm J}\sim 10^{4-5} \ {\rm M}_\odot$, a sufficient amount to
induce the gravitational collapse, leading to the SMS formation.

outlying physical configurations, such as rapid pulsators, deep eclipsing

particle acceleration along the protostellar jet candidate, along with a
non-LTE analysis of the SiO emission along the jet. The emission morphology of
the SiO rotational transitions hints for the first time at the presence of a
collimated jet originating very close to the brightest protostar in the

ionisation rate, as confirmed by modelling the protostellar jet.

into our spectroscopic analysis (i.e. updated K-band line list, better

inner bulge stars. We investigate bulge membership using spectro-photometric

fits our metallicity distribution function (MDF) and our alpha-element trends.
Among our 72 stars, we find four that are not bulge members. [Si/Fe] and
[Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] trends show a typical thick disc alpha-element behaviour,
except that we do not see any plateau at supersolar metallicities as seen in
other works. The NLTE analysis lowers [Mg/Fe] typically by $\sim$0.1 dex,
resulting in a noticeably lower trend of [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H]. The derived
[Ca/Fe] versus [Fe/H] trend has a larger scatter than those for Si and Mg, but
is in excellent agreement with local thin and thick disc trends. With our
updated analysis, we constructed one of the most detailed studies of the alpha
abundance trends of cool M giants in the inner Galactic bulge. We modelled
these abundances by adopting a two-infall chemical-evolution model with two
distinct gas-infall episodes with timescales of 0.4 Gyr and 2 Gyr,

their microscopic origin is still the subject of intense studies, ordered
arrays of quantum emitters are routinely fabricated using static
strain-gradients, which are used to drive excitons toward localized regions of
the 2D crystals where quantum-light-emission takes place. However, the
possibility of using strain in a dynamic fashion to control the appearance of
individual quantum emitters has never been explored so far. In this work, we
tackle this challenge by introducing a novel hybrid semiconductor-piezoelectric
device in which WSe2 monolayers are integrated onto piezoelectric pillars
delivering both static and dynamic strains. Static strains are first used to
induce the formation of quantum emitters, whose emission shows photon
anti-bunching. Their excitonic population and emission energy are then
reversibly controlled via the application of a voltage to the piezoelectric
pillar. Numerical simulations combined with drift-diffusion equations show that
these effects are due to a strain-induced modification of the
confining-potential landscape, which in turn leads to a net redistribution of
excitons among the different quantum emitters. Our work provides relevant
insights into the role of strain in the formation of quantum emitters in 2D

phi and its first two time derivatives. The associated Hamiltonian is
third-order, and admits infinitely many vacuum solutions. These vacuum
solutions can be pieced together to generate a multiverse. This is done for
those FLRW spaces with k>0. So when time, t, is less than zero we have a
universe in which the t=constant spaces are 3-spheres with constant curvature
k. As time passes through zero the underlying 4-space splits into an infinity
of spaces (branches) with metric tensors that describe piecewise de Sitter
spaces until some cutoff time, which will, in general, be different for
different branches. After passing through the cutoff time all branches will
return to their original 4-space in which the t=constant spaces are of constant
curvature k, but will remain separate from all of the other branch universes.
The metric tensor for this multiverse is everywhere continuous, but experiences
discontinuous derivatives as the universe branches change between different de
Sitter spaces. Some questions I address using this formalism are: what is the
nature of matter when t<0; what happens to matter as time passes through t=0;
and what was the universe doing before the multiple universes came into
existence at t=0? The answers to these questions will help to explain the

inspired osculating Barthel-Kropina cosmology. The Barthel-Kropina cosmological
approach is based on the introduction of a Barthel connection in an osculating
Finsler geometry, with the connection having the property that it is the
Levi-Civita connection of a Riemannian metric. From the generalized Friedmann
equations of the Barthel-Kropina model, obtained by assuming that the
background Riemannian metric is of the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker
type, an effective geometric dark energy component can be generated, with the
effective, geometric type pressure, satisfying a linear barotropic type
equation of state. The cosmological tests, and comparisons with observational
data of this dark energy model are considered in detail. To constrain the
Barthel-Kropina model parameters, and the parameter of the equation of state,
we use 57 Hubble data points, and the Pantheon Supernovae Type Ia data sample.
The st statistical analysis is performed by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) simulations. A detailed comparison with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model
is also performed, with the Akaike information criterion (AIC), and the
Bayesian information criterion (BIC) used as the two model selection tools. The
statefinder diagnostics consisting of jerk and snap parameters, and the $Om(z)$
diagnostics are also considered for the comparative study of the
Barthel-Kropina and $\Lambda$CDM cosmologies. Our results indicate that the
Barthel-Kropina dark energy model gives a good description of the observational
data, and thus it can be considered a viable alternative of the $\Lambda$CDM
model.

that the solution will converge in large time to a superposition of
Lorentz-transformed solitons (with slightly modified velocities), and a
radiation term which is at main order a free wave. Moreover, we construct a
finite-codimension centre-stable manifold around the well-separated

optimize the structure of Deep Learning (DL) models for complex tasks such as
Image Classification or Object Detection. However, many other relevant
applications of DL, especially at the edge, are based on time-series processing
and require models with unique features, for which NAS is less explored. This
work focuses in particular on Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), a
convolutional model for time-series processing that has recently emerged as a
promising alternative to more complex recurrent architectures. We propose the
first NAS tool that explicitly targets the optimization of the most peculiar
architectural parameters of TCNs, namely dilation, receptive-field and number
of features in each layer. The proposed approach searches for networks that
offer good trade-offs between accuracy and number of parameters/operations,
enabling an efficient deployment on embedded platforms. We test the proposed
NAS on four real-world, edge-relevant tasks, involving audio and bio-signals.
Results show that, starting from a single seed network, our method is capable
of obtaining a rich collection of Pareto optimal architectures, among which we
obtain models with the same accuracy as the seed, and 15.9-152x fewer
parameters. Compared to three state-of-the-art NAS tools, ProxylessNAS,
MorphNet and FBNetV2, our method explores a larger search space for TCNs (up to
10^12x) and obtains superior solutions, while requiring low GPU memory and
search time. We deploy our NAS outputs on two distinct edge devices, the

STMicroelectronics STM32H7 microcontroller. With respect to the
state-of-the-art hand-tuned models, we reduce latency and energy of up to 5.5x

stylistic objectives (e.g., persuasiveness, memorability, empathy) are hard to

  In this paper, we propose the novel task of style infusion - infusing the
stylistic preferences of audiences in pretrained language generation models.
Since humans are better at pairwise comparisons than direct scoring - i.e., is
Sample-A more persuasive/polite/empathic than Sample-B - we leverage limited
pairwise human judgments to bootstrap a style analysis model and augment our

energy-dissipation equality and follow a gradient flow. In the limit of a
vanishing singularity of the potential, we obtain global non-negative weak
solutions to the power-law thin-film equation \begin{equation*}
  \partial_t u + \partial_x\bigl(m(u) |\partial_x^3 u - G^{\prime\prime}(u)
\partial_x u|^{\alpha-1} \bigl(\partial_x^3 u - G^{\prime\prime}(u) \partial_x
u\bigr)\bigr) = 0 \end{equation*} with potential $G$ in the shear-thinning
($\alpha > 1$), Newtonian ($\alpha = 1$) and shear-thickening case ($0 <\alpha
< 1$). The latter satisfy an energy-dissipation inequality. Finally, we derive
dissipation bounds in the case $G\equiv 0$ which imply that solutions emerging
from initial values with low energy lift up uniformly in finite time.

reducing losses in their constituent materials. Tantalum, like niobium, has
proven utility as the primary superconducting layer within highly coherent
qubits. But, unlike Nb, high temperatures are typically used to stabilize the
desirable body-centered-cubic phase, alpha-Ta, during thin film deposition. It
has long been known that a thin Nb layer permits the room-temperature
nucleation of alpha-Ta, although neither an epitaxial process nor few-photon
microwave loss measurements have been reported for Nb-nucleated Ta films prior
to this study. We compare resonators patterned from Ta films grown at high
temperature (500 {\deg}C) and films nucleated at room temperature, in order to
understand the impact of crystalline order on quantum coherence. In both cases,
films grew with Al2O3 (001) || Ta (110) indicating that the epitaxial
orientation is independent of temperature and is preserved across the Nb/Ta
interface. We use conventional low-power spectroscopy to measure two level
system (TLS) loss, as well as an electric-field bias technique to measure the
effective dipole moments of TLS in the surfaces of resonators. In our
measurements, Nb-nucleated Ta resonators had greater loss tangent (1.5 +/- 0.1
x 10^-5) than non-nucleated (5 +/- 1 x 10^-6) in approximate proportion to
defect densities as characterized by X-ray diffraction (0.27 {\deg} vs 0.18
{\deg} [110] reflection width) and electron microscopy (30 nm vs 70 nm domain
size). The dependence of the loss tangent on domain size indicates that the
development of more ordered Ta films is likely to lead to improvements in qubit
coherence times. Moreover, low-temperature alpha-Ta epitaxy may enable the
growth of new, microstate-free heterostructures which would not withstand high

opportunity in this regard given their large and tunable optical constants near
the excitonic resonances. However, strategies for confining and electrically
tuning the excitons into compact EO modulators have not been realized thus far.
Here, we design and simulate an ultra-compact, plexcitonic (strongly-coupled

required to excel in writing and combining both SQL and application code. The
problem is that writing SQL code in itself is already challenging (e.g., SQL

empirical understanding regarding the characteristics of SQL development tasks.
Do SQL development tasks typically need more code changes? Do they typically
have a longer time-to-completion? Answers to such questions would prepare the
community for the potential challenges associated with such tasks. Our results

significantly longer time-to-completion than SQL-unrelated tasks and require
significantly more code changes. Through our qualitative analyses, we observe
that SQL development tasks require more spread out changes, effort in reviews

virtual knot diagrams, that are considered equivalent up to finite sequences of
extended Reidemeister moves. By contrast, knots in $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be
defined geometrically. They are the points of a space $\mathbb{K}$ of knots.
The knot space has a topology so that equivalent knots lie in the same path
component. The aim of this paper is to use sheaf theory to obtain a fully
geometric model for virtual knots. The geometric model formalizes the intuitive
notion that a virtual knot is an actual knot residing in a variable ambient
space; the usual diagrammatic theory follows as in the classical case. To do
this, it is shown that there exists a site $(\textbf{VK}, J_{\textbf{VK}})$ so
that its category $\text{Sh}(\textbf{VK},J_{\textbf{VK}})$ of sheaves can be
naturally interpreted as the ``space of virtual knots''. A point of this
Grothendieck topos, that is a geometric morphism $\textbf{Sets} \to
\text{Sh}(\textbf{VK})$, is a virtual knot. The virtual isotopy relation is
generated by paths in this space, or more precisely, geometric morphisms
$\text{Sh}([0,1]) \to \text{Sh}(\textbf{VK},J_{\textbf{VK}})$. Virtual knot
invariants valued in a discrete topological space $\mathbb{G}$ are geometric
morphisms $\text{Sh}(\textbf{VK},J_{\textbf{VK}}) \to \text{Sh}(\mathbb{G})$,
just as classical knot invariants valued in $\mathbb{G}$ are continuous
functions $\mathbb{K} \to \mathbb{G}$. The embedding of classical knots into
virtual knots is also realized as a geometric morphism.

method that learns the optimal parameters of a kernel based on the premise that
a kernel is good if there is no significant loss in accuracy if half of the

other objective for other variants of Kernel Flows). However, this method is
limited by the choice of the base kernel. In this paper, we introduce the

measure the speed of sound in air at room tempature. With the help of sound
sensor, two consecutive harmonic frequency values were determined and the
fundamental frequency was calculated. Using the tube features and the
fundamental frequency value, the speed of sound propagation in the air at room
temperature was calculated as 386.42 m/s. This value is theoretically 346 m/s.
This study, in which the propagation speed of the sound is calculated with very
low cost and coding studies with 12% error margin, is important in terms of
hosting all STEM gains and can be easily applied in classrooms.

only appears in networks with many species. Taken together, our results confirm
that, in random reversible networks, ACR and multistationarity together, or
even ACR on its own, is highly atypical. Our proofs rely on two prior results,

tracking, cataloguing and characterization of 90\% of the 140 meter and larger
near-Earth objects (NEOs) by 2020. At the deadline $\sim$35\% were detected,
tracked and catalogued, but only a small fraction were characterized. At the
present rate, it will take 40 years to meet the detection mandate, and there
are insufficient global facilities dedicated to NEO characterization to come
close to the characterization threshold. The major surveys focus mainly on
detection and initial orbit determination, which must be refined in order to
fully be tracked and catalogued. Characterization requires observations
spanning multiple wavelengths, cadences, and instruments, so it is challenging
for observers to acquire the requisite data in a timely manner for planetary
defense. Two upcoming surveys will easily meet the 90\% threshold for
detection, but each will require separate facilities to tip and queue to refine
orbits and characterize new discoveries, and they will provide too many
discoveries for ground and space-based assets to keep up with. Here, I argue
for a constellation of proliferating small satellites carrying visible and
infrared sensors that would offer the needed coverage and flexibility to follow
up detections from current and upcoming surveys in a timely manner. Such a
constellation would enable NASA to move beyond the detection focused
investments and fully meet the 2005 Congressional mandate.

aligns the points in two series with one another. These alignments support
warping of the time dimension to allow for processes that unfold at differing

over any allowable warping of the time dimension. The cost of an alignment of
two points is a function of the difference in the values of those points. The
original cost function was the absolute value of this difference. Other cost
functions have been proposed. A popular alternative is the square of the
difference. However, to our knowledge, this is the first investigation of both
the relative impacts of using different cost functions and the potential to
tune cost functions to different tasks. We do so in this paper by using a
tunable cost function {\lambda}{\gamma} with parameter {\gamma}. We show that
higher values of {\gamma} place greater weight on larger pairwise differences,
while lower values place greater weight on smaller pairwise differences. We
demonstrate that training {\gamma} significantly improves the accuracy of both

conditions in the program. In Swift, errors are represented by values of types
that conform to the Error protocol. Throwing an error lets you indicate that
something unexpected happened, and the normal flow of execution can't continue.
A throw statement is used to throw an error. Optional returns are used to
represent the absence of a value, but when an operation fails, it's often
useful to understand what caused the failure so that code can respond
accordingly. Therefore, I propose to bridge the Swift Error Handling modeling
to C++ to improve the interoperability between the programming languages. The
main idea is to be able to throw a C++ exception that stores a thrown Swift
Error that has to be represented by a C++ class. In addition to that, to
support C++ programs that don't use exceptions, I propose an additional
interoperability mode for throwing functions. When C++ exceptions are disabled,
C++ functions should return a result value that contains either the value
returned by the function or the Swift Error value: the Swift::Exception<T>

increasing research interest recently due to the efficacy of controlling a
large number of agents in a swarm (sheep) using a smaller number of actuators
(sheepdogs). However, shepherding a highly dispersed swarm in an
obstacle-cluttered environment remains challenging for existing methods. To
improve the efficacy of shepherding in complex environments with obstacles and
dispersed sheep, this paper proposes a planning-assisted context-sensitive
autonomous shepherding framework with collision avoidance abilities. The
proposed approach models the swarm shepherding problem as a single Travelling
Salesperson Problem (TSP), with two sheepdogs\textquoteright\ modes:
no-interaction and interaction. An adaptive switching approach is integrated
into the framework to guide real-time path planning for avoiding collisions
with static and dynamic obstacles; the latter representing moving sheep swarms.
We then propose an overarching hierarchical mission planning system, which is
made of three sub-systems: a clustering approach to group and distinguish sheep
sub-swarms, an Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm as a TSP solver for
determining the optimal herding sequence of the sub-swarms, and an online path
planner for calculating optimal paths for both sheepdogs and sheep. The
experiments on various environments, both with and without obstacles,
objectively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed shepherding framework
and planning approaches.

Efficient variational methods, such as Belief Propagation (BP) and Tree
Re-Weighted (TRW) algorithms, compute $Z$ approximately minimizing respective
(BP- or TRW-) free energy. We generalize the variational scheme building a
$\lambda$-fractional-homotopy, $Z^{(\lambda)}$, where $\lambda=0$ and
$\lambda=1$ correspond to TRW- and BP-approximations, respectively, and
$Z^{(\lambda)}$ decreases with $\lambda$ monotonically. Moreover, this
fractional scheme guarantees that in the attractive (ferromagnetic) case
$Z^{(TRW)}\geq Z^{(\lambda)}\geq Z^{(BP)}$, and there exists a unique
(``exact"") $\lambda_*$ such that, $Z=Z^{(\lambda_*)}$. Generalizing the
re-parametrization approach of \cite{wainwright_tree-based_2002} and the loop
series approach of \cite{chertkov_loop_2006}, we show how to express $Z$ as a
product, $\forall \lambda:\ Z=Z^{(\lambda)}{\cal Z}^{(\lambda)}$, where the
multiplicative correction, ${\cal Z}^{(\lambda)}$, is an expectation over a
node-independent probability distribution built from node-wise fractional
marginals. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by extensive experiments
with models from Ising ensembles over planar and random graphs of medium- and
large- sizes. The empirical study yields a number of interesting observations,
such as (a) ability to estimate ${\cal Z}^{(\lambda)}$ with $O(N^4)$ fractional
samples; (b) suppression of $\lambda_*$ fluctuations with increase in $N$ for
instances from a particular random Ising ensemble.

approach by studying the correlation of eigenvectors with synthetic gene
expression data simulated with a basic and popular model of gene expression
dynamics -- attractors of Boolean threshold dynamics in signed directed graphs.
  Eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian are known to explain collective dynamical
states (stationary patterns) in Turing dynamics on graphs. In this study, we
show that eigenvectors can also predict collective states (attractors) for a
markedly different type of dynamics, Boolean threshold dynamics, and category
of graphs, signed directed graphs. However, the overall predictive power
depends on details of the network architecture, in a predictable fashion.
  Our results are a set of statistical observations, providing the first
systematic step towards a further theoretical understanding of the role of
eigenvectors in dynamics on graphs.

hours. Current Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations pose many open questions
in regard to the nature of switchbacks. For example, are they stable as they
propagate through the inner heliosphere, and how are they formed? In this work,
we aim to investigate the structure and origin of switchbacks. In order to
study the stability of switchbacks, we suppose the small-scale current sheets
therein are generated by magnetic braiding, and they should work to stabilize
the switchbacks. With more than one thousand switchbacks identified with PSP
observations in seven encounters, we find many more current sheets inside than
outside switchbacks, indicating that these microstructures should work to
stabilize the S-shaped structures of switchbacks. Additionally, we study the
helium variations to trace the switchbacks to their origins. We find both
helium-rich and helium-poor populations in switchbacks, implying that the
switchbacks could originate from both closed and open magnetic field regions in
the Sun. Moreover, we observe that the alpha-proton differential speeds also
show complex variations as compared to the local Alfv\'en speed. The joint
distributions of both parameters show that low helium abundance together with
low differential speed is the dominant state in switchbacks. The presence of
small-scale current sheets in switchbacks along with the helium features are in
line with the hypothesis that switchbacks could originate from the Sun via
interchange reconnection process. However, other formation mechanisms are not
excluded.

Reynolds number, we use two datasets - from the Melbourne wind tunnel and from
SLTEST - an atmospheric surface layer experiment. We show that an index, namely
the burstiness index, can be used successfully to describe the multi-scale
nature of turbulent bursting while accounting for the small-scale intermittency
effects. Through this index, we demonstrate that irrespective of the Reynolds
number, the presence of large amplitude fluctuations in the instantaneous
velocity variance and momentum flux signals are governed by the coherent
structures in the flow. Concerning small-scale turbulence, a Reynolds
number-dependence is noted while studying the scale-wise evolution of the
burstiness features of second-order streamwise velocity increments. Specific to
the wind-tunnel dataset, the burstiness index of streamwise velocity increment
signal displays a strong dependence on height and also decreases as the scales
increase with the maximum being obtained at scales comparable to the

accretion, which greatly reduces the radiative efficiency as photons are
swallowed by the central black hole before they can escape from the accretion
flow. This effect is interpreted as the radial advection of energy in
one-dimensional height-integrated models, such as the slim disc model. However,
when multi-dimensional effects are considered, the conventional understanding
may no longer hold. In this paper, we study the advective energy transport in
super-Eddington accretion, based on a new two-dimensional inflow-outflow
solution with radial self-similarity, in which the advective factor is
calculated self-consistently by incorporating the calculation of radiative
flux, instead of being set as an input parameter. We find that radial advection
is actually a heating mechanism in the inflow due to compression, and the
energy balance in the inflow is maintained by cooling via radiation and
vertical ($\theta$-direction) advection, which transports entropy upwards to be
radiated closer to the surface or carried away by the outflow. As a result,
less photons are advected inwards and more photons are released from the
surface, so that the mean advective factor is smaller and the emergent flux is
larger than those predicted by the slim disc model. The radiative efficiency of
super-Eddington accretion thus should be larger than that of the slim disc
model, which agrees with the results of some recent numerical simulations.

i.e., by applying auxiliary excitations which interfere with the absorption
processes from the main drive. We focus on the Mott insulating single-band
Hubbard model and study the effects of multi-color driving with nonequilibrium
dynamical mean-field theory. The main excitation is a periodic electric field
with frequency $\Omega$ smaller than the Mott gap, while for the auxiliary
excitations, we consider additional electric fields and/or hopping modulations
with a higher harmonic of $\Omega$. To suppress the 3-photon absorption of the
main excitation, which is a parity-odd process, we consider auxiliary
electric-field excitations and a combination of electric-field excitations and
hopping modulations. On the other hand, to suppress the 2-photon absorption,
which is a parity-even process, we consider hopping modulations. The conditions
for an efficient suppression of heating are well captured by the Floquet
effective Hamiltonian derived with the high-frequency expansion in a rotating
frame. As an application, we focus on the exchange couplings of the spins
(pseudo-spins) in the repulsive (attractive) model, and demonstrate that the
suppression of heating allows to realize and clearly observe a significant
Floquet-induced change of the low energy physics.

do not generalize to arbitrary circuit shapes (e.g., S-like curves). So, the
question ""When to go into which mode and how to drive in it?"" remains
unanswered. To choose the suitable mode (discrete decision), the algorithm

effects of reionization and feedback from supernova explosions are thought to
be strong enough to remove the gas left, which prevent moderately old stellar

spatial domain. However, these simulations are often prohibitively costly to
survey the input space. In this paper, we propose an efficient emulator that
simultaneously predicts the outputs on a set of mesh nodes, with theoretical
justification of its uncertainty quantification. The novelty of the proposed
method lies in the incorporation of the mesh node coordinates into the
statistical model. In particular, the proposed method segments the mesh nodes
into multiple clusters via a Dirichlet process prior and fits a Gaussian
process model in each. Most importantly, by revealing the underlying clustering
structures, the proposed method can extract valuable flow physics present in
the systems that can be used to guide further investigations. Real examples are
demonstrated to show that our proposed method has smaller prediction errors
than its main competitors, with competitive computation time, and provides
valuable insights about the underlying physics of the systems. An R package for
the proposed methodology is provided in an open repository.

  Network Accelerators","To appear at HPCA'23",,,,"cs.LG cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are becoming increasingly popular as they
overcome the limited applicability of prior neural networks. A GCN takes as
input an arbitrarily structured graph and executes a series of layers which
exploit the graph's structure to calculate their output features. One recent
trend in GCNs is the use of deep network architectures. As opposed to the
traditional GCNs which only span around two to five layers deep, modern GCNs
now incorporate tens to hundreds of layers with the help of residual
connections. From such deep GCNs, we find an important characteristic that they
exhibit very high intermediate feature sparsity. We observe that with deep
layers and residual connections, the number of zeros in the intermediate
features sharply increases. This reveals a new opportunity for accelerators to
exploit in GCN executions that was previously not present.
  In this paper, we propose SGCN, a fast and energy-efficient GCN accelerator
which fully exploits the sparse intermediate features of modern GCNs. SGCN
suggests several techniques to achieve significantly higher performance and
energy efficiency than the existing accelerators. First, SGCN employs a
GCN-friendly feature compression format. We focus on reducing the off-chip
memory traffic, which often is the bottleneck for GCN executions. Second, we
propose microarchitectures for seamlessly handling the compressed feature
format. Third, to better handle locality in the existence of the varying
sparsity, SGCN employs sparsity-aware cooperation. Sparsity-aware cooperation
creates a pattern that exhibits multiple reuse windows, such that the cache can
capture diverse sizes of working sets and therefore adapt to the varying level
of sparsity. We show that SGCN achieves 1.71x speedup and 43.9% higher energy
efficiency compared to the existing accelerators.

that involves multiple clients training a global model collaboratively in a
data privacy-preserving manner. However, the data samples usually follow a
long-tailed distribution in the real world, and FL on the decentralized and
long-tailed data yields a poorly-behaved global model severely biased to the
head classes with the majority of the training samples. To alleviate this
issue, decoupled training has recently been introduced to FL, considering it
has achieved promising results in centralized long-tailed learning by
re-balancing the biased classifier after the instance-balanced training.
However, the current study restricts the capacity of decoupled training in
federated long-tailed learning with a sub-optimal classifier re-trained on a
set of pseudo features, due to the unavailability of a global balanced dataset
in FL. In this work, in order to re-balance the classifier more effectively, we
integrate the local real data with the global gradient prototypes to form the
local balanced datasets, and thus re-balance the classifier during the local
training. Furthermore, we introduce an extra classifier in the training phase
to help model the global data distribution, which addresses the problem of
contradictory optimization goals caused by performing classifier re-balancing
locally. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms
the existing state-of-the-art methods in various settings.

is being generated. Efficient storage, transmission, and analysation of this
real-time big data is important, as it serves a number of purposes ranging from
decision making to fault prediction, etc. Alongside this, real-time big data
has rigorous utility and privacy requirements, therefore, it is also
significantly important to choose the handling strategies meticulously. One of
the optimal way to store and transmit data in the form of lossless compression
is Huffman coding, which compresses the data into a variable length binary
stream. Similarly, in order to protect the privacy of such big data,
differential privacy is being used nowadays, which perturbs the data on the
basis of privacy budget and sensitivity. Nevertheless, traditional differential
privacy mechanisms provide privacy guarantees. However, on the other hand,
real-time data cannot be dealt as an ordinary set of records, because it
usually has certain underlying patterns and cycles, which can be used for
forming a link to a specific individuals private information that can lead to
severe privacy leakages (e.g., analysing smart metering data can lead to
classification of individuals daily routine). Thus, it is equally important to
develop a privacy preservation model, which preserves the privacy on the basis
of occurrences and patterns in the data. In this paper, we design a novel
Huff-DP mechanism, which selects the optimal privacy budget on the basis of
privacy requirement for that specific record. In order to further enhance the
budget determination, we propose static, sine, and fuzzy logic based decision
algorithms. From the experimental evaluations, it can be concluded that our
proposed Huff-DP mechanism provides effective privacy protection alongside
reducing the privacy budget computational cost.

difficulty when training samples are not independently and identically
distributed (non-i.i.d.). In this paper, we point out that the client sampling

We find that the negative client sampling will cause the merged data

address this issue, we propose a novel learning rate adaptation mechanism to
adaptively adjust the server learning rate for the aggregated gradient in each
round, according to the consistency between the merged data distribution of
currently sampled clients and that of all available clients. Specifically, we
make theoretical deductions to find a meaningful and robust indicator that is
positively related to the optimal server learning rate and can effectively
reflect the merged data distribution of sampled clients, and we utilize it for
the server learning rate adaptation. Extensive experiments on multiple image

facility on the 1.5 m reflector at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory. Our
observations confirm past detections of Fe I, Fe II and Mg I over multiple
epochs, in addition to excess absorption at H-alpha, which is an indicator for
ongoing mass-loss. From our multi-year dataset, the H-alpha light curve
consistently deviates from a standard transit, and follows a 'W' shape that is
deeper near ingress and egress, and shallower mid-transit. To search for and
quantify any seasonal variations that may be present, we parameterise a
'cometary tail' model to fit for the H-alpha transit. We find no detectable
variations between the different observed epochs. Though a 'cometary tail'
describes the H-alpha flux variations well, we note that such a scenario
requires a high density of neutral hydrogen in the n = 2 excited state far
beyond the planetary atmosphere. Other scenarios, such as centre-to-limb
variations larger than that expected from 1-D atmosphere models, may also
contribute to the observed H-alpha transit shape. These multi-epoch

(VR) has gained a lot of prominence in the last few years and is being used in
various areas such as education, entertainment, scientific visualization, and
computer-aided design. VR-based applications are highly interactive, and one of
the most important performance metrics for these applications is the
motion-to-photon-delay (MPD). MPD is the delay from the users head movement to
the time at which the image gets updated on the VR screen. Since the human
visual system can even detect an error of a few pixels (very spatially
sensitive), the MPD should be as small as possible. Popular VR vendors use the
GPU-accelerated Asynchronous Time Warp (ATW) algorithm to reduce the MPD. ATW
reduces the MPD if and only if the warping operation finishes just before the
display refreshes. However, due to the competition between applications for the
shared GPU, the GPU-accelerated ATW algorithm suffers from an unpredictable ATW
latency, making it challenging to find the ideal time instance for starting the
time warp and ensuring that it completes with the least amount of lag relative
to the screen refresh. Hence, the state-of-the-art is to use a separate
hardware unit for the time warping operation. Our approach, PredATW, uses an
ML-based predictor to predict the ATW latency for a VR application, and then
schedule it as late as possible. This is the first work to do so. Our predictor
achieves an error of 0.77 ms across several popular VR applications for
predicting the ATW latency. As compared to the baseline architecture, we reduce
deadline misses by 73.1%.

adapt it to the target domain. Owing to the mismatch issue among entity types
in different domains, previous approaches normally tune all parameters of PLMs,
ending up with an entirely new NER model for each domain. Moreover, current
models only focus on leveraging knowledge in one general source domain while
failing to successfully transfer knowledge from multiple sources to the target.
To address these issues, we introduce Collaborative Domain-Prefix Tuning for
cross-domain NER (CP-NER) based on text-to-text generative PLMs. Specifically,
we present text-to-text generation grounding domain-related instructors to
transfer knowledge to new domain NER tasks without structural modifications. We
utilize frozen PLMs and conduct collaborative domain-prefix tuning to stimulate
the potential of PLMs to handle NER tasks across various domains. Experimental

have developed rapidly and have been widely used in various real-world fields.
However, they have been shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks.
Specifically, the adversary injects a backdoor into the model during the
training phase, so that input samples with backdoor triggers are classified as
the target class. Some attacks have achieved high attack success rates on the
pre-trained language models (LMs), but there have yet to be effective defense
methods. In this work, we propose a defense method based on deep model mutation
testing. Our main justification is that backdoor samples are much more robust
than clean samples if we impose random mutations on the LMs and that backdoors
are generalizable. We first confirm the effectiveness of model mutation testing
in detecting backdoor samples and select the most appropriate mutation
operators. We then systematically defend against three extensively studied
backdoor attack levels (i.e., char-level, word-level, and sentence-level) by
detecting backdoor samples. We also make the first attempt to defend against
the latest style-level backdoor attacks. We evaluate our approach on three

that by adjusting UV irradiation time, nanostructured silver ultrathin films

controllable p-type doping effect, while the thickness of MoS2 from few-layer

to initiate from the edges of MoS2, and independent of the edge type, thus

mechanisms, as those mechanisms underpinning pedestrian road behavior are not
yet clear. Here, we reinterpret pedestrian crossing behavior based on a
deconstructed crossing decision process at uncontrolled intersections with
continuous traffic. Notably, we explain and model pedestrian crossing behavior
as they wait for crossing opportunities, optimizing crossing decisions by
comparing the visual collision risk of approaching vehicles around them. A
collision risk-based crossing initiation model is proposed to characterize the
time-dynamic nature of pedestrian crossing decisions. A simulation tool is
established to reproduce pedestrian behavior by employing the proposed model
and a social force model. Two datasets collected in a CAVE-based immersive
pedestrian simulator are applied to calibrate and validate the model. The model
predicts pedestrian crossing decisions across all traffic scenarios well. In
particular, by considering the decision strategy that pedestrians compare the
collision risk of surrounding traffic gaps, model performance is significantly
improved. Moreover, the collision risk-based crossing initiation model
accurately captures the timing of pedestrian crossing initiations within each
gap. This work concisely demonstrates how pedestrians dynamically adapt their
crossings in continuous traffic based on perceived collision risk, potentially
providing insights into modeling coupled human-AV interactions or serving as a

For comparison, we introduce a non-stoquastic Hamiltonian that adds

Annealing with the non-stoquastic Hamiltonian is effective for difficult

the energy gap between the ground state and the first excited state of the

representation for a body or hand keypoint. Two popular methods to decode the
heatmap into a final joint coordinate are via an argmax, as done in heatmap
detection, or via softmax and expectation, as done in integral regression.
Integral regression is learnable end-to-end, but has lower accuracy than
detection. This paper uncovers an induced bias from integral regression that
results from combining the softmax and the expectation operation. This bias
often forces the network to learn degenerately localized heatmaps, obscuring
the keypoint's true underlying distribution and leads to lower accuracies.
Training-wise, by investigating the gradients of integral regression, we show
that the implicit guidance of integral regression to update the heatmap makes
it slower to converge than detection. To counter the above two limitations, we
propose Bias Compensated Integral Regression (BCIR), an integral
regression-based framework that compensates for the bias. BCIR also
incorporates a Gaussian prior loss to speed up training and improve prediction
accuracy. Experimental results on both the human body and hand benchmarks show
that BCIR is faster to train and more accurate than the original integral
regression, making it competitive with state-of-the-art detection methods.

can be obtained by a geometric program for both non-orthogonal multiple access

can test that a write is an old and unnecessary version by using version order

leads to missing and false detections, and ultimately leads to inconsistent
judgments of product quality. Unlike the usual noisy labels, the ones used for
surface defect detection appear to be inconsistent rather than mislabeled. The
noise occurs in almost every label and is difficult to correct or evaluate. In
this paper, we proposed a framework that learns trustworthy models from noisy

noisy labels on the model, we represent the suspicious regions with consistent
and precise elements at the pixel-level and redesign the loss function.
Secondly, without changing network structure and adding any extra labels,
pluggable spatially correlated Bayesian module is proposed. Finally, the defect

standard practice since their breakthrough effectiveness few years ago. But, is
this approach well understood? In this paper, we study the impact of the
pretraining collection on the final IR effectiveness. In particular, we
challenge the current hypothesis that PLM shall be trained on a large enough
generic collection and we show that pretraining from scratch on the collection
of interest is surprisingly competitive with the current approach. We benchmark
first-stage ranking rankers and cross-encoders for reranking on the task of
general passage retrieval on MSMARCO, Mr-Tydi for Arabic, Japanese and Russian,
and TripClick for specific domain. Contrary to popular belief, we show that,
for finetuning first-stage rankers, models pretrained solely on their
collection have equivalent or better effectiveness compared to more general
models. However, there is a slight effectiveness drop for rerankers pretrained
only on the target collection. Overall, our study sheds a new light on the role
of the pretraining collection and should make our community ponder on building
specialized models by pretraining from scratch. Last but not least, doing so
could enable better control of efficiency, data bias and replicability, which
are key research questions for the IR community.

selected as the coding scheme for the control channel in the fifth generation
(5G) wireless communication systems. However, the conventional polar codes have
only been constructed by binary (2x2) kernel which poses block length
limitation to powers of 2. To attain more flexible block lengths, multi-kernel
polar codes are proposed. In this paper, a combinational architecture for
multi-kernel polar codes with high throughput is proposed based on successive
cancellation decoding algorithm. The proposed scheme can decode pure-binary,
pure-ternary (3x3), and binary-ternary mixed polar codes. The decoder's
architecture is rate-flexible meaning that a new code rate can be assigned to
the decoder at every clock cycle. The proposed architecture is validated by
FPGA implementation and the results reveal that a code of size N=81 gains the
coded throughput of 1664.5 Mbps. A novel Python-based polar compiler is also
proposed to automatically generate the HDL modules for target decoders. A
designer can input the target block length and kernel ordering of a polar code,
and get the required VHDL files automatically. Based on our simulations, the
majority of the required HDL files can be generated in less than 0.4 seconds.

real-world applications. Still, they are susceptible against imperceptible
adversarial perturbations. The most effective solution for this problem is
adversarial training that trains the model with adversarially perturbed samples
instead of original ones. Various methods have been developed over recent years
to improve adversarial training such as data augmentation or modifying training
attacks. In this work, we examine the same problem from a new data-centric
perspective. For this purpose, we first demonstrate that the existing
model-based methods can be equivalent to applying smaller perturbation or
optimization weights to the hard training examples. By using this finding, we
propose detecting and removing these hard samples directly from the training
procedure rather than applying complicated algorithms to mitigate their
effects. For detection, we use maximum softmax probability as an effective
method in out-of-distribution detection since we can consider the hard samples
as the out-of-distribution samples for the whole data distribution. Our results
on SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets show the effectiveness of this method in
improving the adversarial training without adding too much computational cost.

high frequency components as well. Furthermore, we also combine several
state-of-the-art techniques from low-level vision fields into our approach,
such as the high-order degradation model, efficient lightweight network design,
and Image Quality Assessment model. By jointly using these powerful techniques,
our RPP approach can achieve on average, 16.27% bitrate saving with different
video encoders like AVC, HEVC, and VVC under multiple quality metrics. In the
deployment stage, our RPP method is very simple and efficient which is not
required any changes in the setting of video encoding, streaming, and decoding.
Each input frame only needs to make a single pass through RPP before sending
into video encoders. In addition, in our subjective visual quality test, 87% of
users think videos with RPP are better or equal to videos by only using the
codec to compress, while these videos with RPP save about 12% bitrate on
average. Our RPP framework has been integrated into the production environment
of our video transcoding services which serve millions of users every day.

length by the oscillation frequency. Although frequency tuning is the primary
means by which a swimmer selects its speed, there is no consensus on the
mechanisms involved. In this article, we propose scaling laws for undulatory
swimmers that relate oscillation frequency to length by taking into account
both the biological characteristics of the muscles and the interaction of the
moving swimmer with its environment. Results are supported by an extensive
literature review including approximately 1200 individuals of different
species, sizes and swimming environments. We highlight a crossover in length
around 0.5-1 m. Below this value, the frequency can be tuned between 2-20 Hz
due to biological constraints and the interplay between slow and fast muscles.
Above this value, the fluid-swimmer interaction must be taken into account and
the frequency is inversely proportional to the length of the animal. This
approach predicts a maximum swimming speed around 5-10 m.s$^{-1}$ for large
swimmers, consistent with the threshold to prevent bubble cavitation.

with Bayesian model selection. Although Bayesian model selection is an
intuitively appealing tool for regression splines by virtue of the flexible
knot placement and model-averaged function estimates, its use has traditionally
been limited to Gaussian additive regression, as posterior search of the model
space requires a tractable form of the marginal model likelihood. We introduce
an extension of the method to the exponential family of distributions using the
Laplace approximation to the likelihood. Although the Laplace approximation is
successful with all Gaussian-type prior distributions in providing a
closed-form expression of the marginal likelihood, there is no broad consensus
on the best prior distribution to be used for nonparametric regression via
model selection. We observe that the classical unit information prior
distribution for variable selection may not be suitable for nonparametric
regression using basis expansions. Instead, our study reveals that mixtures of
g-priors are more suitable. A large family of mixtures of g-priors is
considered for a detailed examination of how various mixture priors perform in
estimating generalized additive models. Furthermore, we compare several priors
of knots for model selection-based spline approaches to determine the most
practically effective scheme. The model selection-based estimation methods are
also compared with other Bayesian approaches to function estimation. Extensive
simulation studies demonstrate the validity of the model selection-based
approaches. We provide an R package for the proposed method.

expressions for the gravitational moments $J_{2n}$ of a systems made of ${\cal

rotational motion. We then discuss how to solve the inverse problem, which
consists in finding the equilibrium configurations (i.e. internal structures)
that reproduce ``exactly'' a set of observables, namely the equatorial radius,
the total mass, the shape and the first gravitational moments. Two coefficients
$J_{2n}$ being constrained per surface, ${\cal L}=1+\frac{n}{2}$ layers ($n$
even) are required to fix $J_2$ to $J_{2n}$.
  As shown, this problem already suffers from a severe degeneracy, inherent in
the fact that two spheroidal surfaces in the system confocal with each other
leave unchanged all the moments. The complexity, which increases with the
number of layers involved, can be reduced by considering the rotation rate of
each layer. Jupiter is used as a test-bed to illustrate the method, concretely
for ${\cal L}=2,3$ and $4$. For this planet, the number of possible internal
structures is infinite for ${\cal L} > 2$. Intermediate layers can have smaller
or larger oblateness, and can rotate slower or faster than the surroundings.
Configurations with large and massive cores are always present. Low-mass cores
(of the order a few Earth masses) are predicted for ${\cal L} \ge 4$. The
results are in good agreement with the numerical solutions obtained from the

$\alpha\rightarrow\omega$ phase transformation in commercially pure Zr under
hydrostatic compression has been studied using in situ x-ray diffraction
measurements. Two samples were studied: one is plastically pre-deformed Zr with
saturated hardness and the other is annealed. Phase transformation
$\alpha\rightarrow\omega$ initiates at lower pressure for pre-deformed sample,
suggesting pre-straining promotes nucleation by producing more defects with
stronger stress concentrators. With transformation progress, the promoting
effect on nucleation reduces while that on growth is suppressed by producing
more obstacles for interface propagation. The crystal domain size reduces and
microstrain and dislocation density increase during loading for both $\alpha$
and $\omega$ phases in their single-phase regions. For $\alpha$ phase, domain
sizes are much smaller for prestrained Zr, while microstrain and dislocation
densities are much higher. On the other hand, they do not differ much in
$\omega$ Zr for both prestrained and annealed samples, implying that
microstructure is not inherited during phase transformation. The significant
effect of pressure on the microstructural parameters (domain size, microstrain,
and dislocation density) demonstrates that their postmortem evaluation does not
represent the true conditions during loading. A simple model for the initiation
of the phase transformation involving microstrain is suggested, and a possible
model for the growth is outlined. The obtained results suggest an extended
experimental basis is required for better predictive models for the
pressure-induced and combined pressure- and strain-induced phase
transformations.

however, one or more terms of the residual are measured in negative or
fractional Sobolev norms. In this work, we provide a general approach to
replace those norms by efficiently evaluable expressions without sacrificing
quasi-optimality of the resulting numerical solution. We exemplify our approach
by verifying the necessary inf-sup conditions for four formulations of a model
second order elliptic equation with inhomogeneous Dirichlet and/or Neumann
boundary conditions. We report on numerical experiments for the Poisson problem
with mixed inhomogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions in an
ultra-weak first order system formulation.

focus of discussions on the origin of galactic cosmic rays (CRs). The
proposition of CR acceleration inside superbubbles (SBs) blown by the strong
winds of these clusters avoids issues faced by the standard paradigm of
acceleration at supernova remnant shocks. Aims: We provide an interpretation of
the latest TeV $\gamma$-ray observations of the region around the YMC
Westerlund 1 taken with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) in terms
of diffusive shock acceleration at the cluster wind termination shock, taking
into account the spectrum and morphology of the emission. As Westerlund 1 is a
prototypical example of a YMC, such a study is relevant to the general question
about the role of YMCs for the Galactic CR population. Methods: We generate
model $\gamma$-ray spectra, characterise particle propagation inside the SB
based on the advection, diffusion, and cooling timescales, and constrain key
parameters of the system. We consider hadronic emission from proton-proton
interaction and subsequent pion decay and leptonic emission from inverse
Compton scattering on all relevant photon fields, including the CMB, diffuse
and dust-scattered starlight, and the photon field of Westerlund 1 itself. The
effect of the magnetic field on cooling and propagation is discussed.
Klein-Nishina effects are found to be important in determining the spectral
evolution of the electron population. Results: A leptonic origin of the bulk of
the observed $\gamma$-rays is preferable. The model is energetically plausible,
consistent with the presence of a strong shock, and allows for the observed
energy-independent morphology. The hadronic model faces two main issues:
confinement of particles to the emission region and an unrealistic energy
requirement.

Graph CAs (GCAs) generalise standard CAs by allowing for arbitrary graphs

generalise Convolutional NNs. Recently, Graph Neural CAs (GNCAs) have been
proposed as models built on top of standard GNNs that can be trained to
approximate the transition rule of any arbitrary GCA. Existing GNCAs are
anisotropic in the sense that their transition rules are not equivariant to
translation, rotation, and reflection of the nodes' spatial locations. However,
it is desirable for instances related by such transformations to be treated
identically by the model. By replacing standard graph convolutions with
E(n)-equivariant ones, we avoid anisotropy by design and propose a class of

can nevertheless handle large graphs, capture complex dynamics and exhibit
emergent self-organising behaviours. We showcase the broad and successful
applicability of E(n)-GNCAs on three different tasks: (i) pattern formation,

blood vessel wall via either a membrane, a shell, or a 3D solid element. Each
of these formulations has its trade offs concerning accuracy, ease of
implementation, and computational costs. Despite the widespread use of these
formulations, a systematic comparison on the performance and accuracy of these
formulations for nonlinear vascular biomechanics is lacking. Therefore, the
decision regarding the optimal choice often relies on intuition or previous
experience, with unclear consequences of choosing one approach over the other.
Here, we present a systematic comparison among three different formulations to
represent vessel wall: (i) a nonlinear membrane model, (ii) a nonlinear,
rotation-free shell model, and (iii) a nonlinear 3D solid model. For the 3D
solid model, we consider two different implementations employing linear and
quadratic interpolation. We present comparison results in both idealized and
subject-specific mouse geometries. For the idealized cylindrical geometry, we
compare our results against the axisymmetric solution for three different wall
thickness to radius ratio. Subsequently, a comparison of these approaches is
presented in an idealized bifurcation model for regionally varying wall
thickness. Lastly, we present the comparison results for a subject-specific
mouse geometry with regionally varying material properties and wall thickness,
while incorporating the effect of external tissue surrounding the vessel wall.

localize the wave function of a single particle at all energy scales, a
phenomenon known as Stark localization. The energy-dependent Stark localization
transition point, i.e. mobility edge, tends to a transition at infinitesimal
fields as the system size increases, closely resembling the Anderson
localization without disorder. Here, we show that the single-particle Stark
probe not only achieves quantum-enhanced sensitivity for weak-field sensing but
also allows for strong super-Heisenberg scaling across its entire spectrum.
This quantum-enhanced sensitivity, which is well-beyond most of the known
quantum sensing schemes, stretches from the extended phase and goes beyond the
transition point and can be achieved by a simple position measurement.
Moreover, through extensive finite-size scaling analysis, we have identified
several critical exponents of the Stark localization transition and established
their relationship. Interestingly, at finite temperatures, the achievable
precision reduces to Heisenberg scaling, which is still well beyond the
capability of classical sensors. We have also identified a universal behavior

the stress state evolution and fault structures of the crust. Empirical models
based on self-exciting point-processes continue to provide an important tool
for analyzing seismicity, given the epistemic uncertainty associated with
physical models. In particular, the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS)
model acts as a reference model for studying seismicity catalogs. The
traditional ETAS model uses simple parametric definitions for the background
rate of triggering-independent seismicity. This reduces the effectiveness of
the basic ETAS model in modelling the temporally complex seismicity patterns
seen in seismic swarms that are dominated by aseismic tectonic processes such
as fluid injection rather than aftershock triggering. In order to robustly
capture time-varying seismicity rates, we introduce a deep Gaussian process
formulation for the background rate as an extension to ETAS. Gaussian processes
(GPs) are a robust non-parametric model for function spaces with covariance
structure. By conditioning the lengthscale structure of a GP with another GP,
we have a deep-GP: a probabilistic, hierarchical model that automatically tunes
its structure to match data constraints. We show how the deep-GP-ETAS model can
be efficiently sampled by making use of a Metropolis-within-Gibbs scheme,
taking advantage of the branching process formulation of ETAS and a stochastic
partial differential equation (SPDE) approximation for Mat\'ern GPs. We
illustrate our method using synthetic examples, and show that the deep-GP-ETAS

superconducting states. It has thus not been clear whether they can be stable
for reasonable pairing interactions or are in practice preempted by
time-reversal-symmetric states with vanishing DOS. In this Letter, we show
within BCS theory applied to a paradigmatic model that the
time-reversal-symmetry-breaking states are indeed stabilized over broad
parameter ranges at weak coupling. Moreover, we introduce a fast method that
involves solving the inverse BCS gap equation, does not require iteration, does
not suffer from convergence problems, and can handle metastable solutions.

  Broadcast Channel",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has recently received significant
attention in wireless networks owing to its ability to smartly control the
wireless propagation through passive reflection. Although prior works have
employed the IRS to enhance the system performance under various setups, the
fundamental capacity limits of an IRS aided multi-antenna multi-user system
have not yet been characterized. Motivated by this, we investigate an IRS aided
multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel by considering the
capacity-achieving dirty paper coding (DPC) scheme and dynamic beamforming
configurations. We first propose a bisection based framework to characterize
its capacity region by optimally solving the sum-rate maximization problem
under a set of rate constraints, which is also applicable to characterize the
achievable rate region with the zero-forcing (ZF) scheme. Interestingly, it is
rigorously proved that dynamic beamforming is able to enlarge the achievable
rate region of ZF if the IRS phase-shifts cannot achieve fully orthogonal
channels, whereas the attained gains become marginal due to the reduction of
the channel correlations induced by smartly adjusting the IRS phase-shifts. The
result implies that employing the IRS is able to reduce the demand for
implementing dynamic beamforming. Finally, we analytically prove that the
sum-rate achieved by the IRS aided ZF is capable of approaching that of the IRS
aided DPC with a sufficiently large IRS in practice. Simulation results shed
light on the impact of the IRS on transceiver designs and validate our
theoretical findings, which provide useful guidelines to practical systems by
indicating that replacing sophisticated schemes with easy-implementation
schemes would only result in slight performance loss.

structure to such data by detecting argumentative components in the text and
classifying the relations between them. However, as it is the case for many
tasks in Natural Language Processing in general and in medical text processing

available for argumentation in the medical domain, namely, the annotated

effective way to generate annotated data without manual intervention.
Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the translation and projection

temperature of 0.7 keV, very likely produced by shocks in the supergiant donor
wind. These observations covered different orbital phases, but all appear
compatible with the low luminosity level expected from the orbital INTEGRAL
light curve. The absorbing column density is variable in the range
$10^{22}-10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. A broad-band X-ray spectrum could be investigated

comfort and time efficiency. The human driving data is compared with two
optimization-based motion planners that we developed in the past. In situations
when there is no difference in travel times, human drivers incurred an average
of 23.5% more energy in the longitudinal and lateral acceleration signals than
the motion planner that minimizes accelerations. In terms of frequency-weighted
acceleration energy, an indicator correlated with the incidence of motion
sickness, the average performance deficiency rises to 70.2%. Frequency-domain
analysis reveals that human drivers exhibit more longitudinal oscillations in
the frequency range of 0.2-1 Hz and more lateral oscillations in the frequency
range of up to 0.2 Hz. This is reflected in time-domain data features such as
less smooth speed profiles and higher velocities for long turns. The
performance difference also partly results from several practical matters and
additional factors considered by human drivers when planning and controlling
vehicle motion. The driving data collected in this study provides a performance
baseline for motion planning algorithms to compare with and can be further
exploited to deepen the understanding of human drivers.

  2023",,,"cs.SE cs.CR cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Static analysis is a powerful tool for detecting security vulnerabilities and
other programming problems. Global taint tracking, in particular, can spot
vulnerabilities arising from complicated data flow across multiple functions.
However, precisely identifying which flows are problematic is challenging, and
sometimes depends on factors beyond the reach of pure program analysis, such as
conventions and informal knowledge. For example, learning that a parameter
""name"" of an API function ""locale"" ends up in a file path is surprising and
potentially problematic. In contrast, it would be completely unsurprising to
find that a parameter ""command"" passed to an API function ""execaCommand"" is
eventually interpreted as part of an operating-system command. This paper
presents Fluffy, a bimodal taint analysis that combines static analysis, which
reasons about data flow, with machine learning, which probabilistically
determines which flows are potentially problematic. The key idea is to let
machine learning models predict from natural language information involved in a
taint flow, such as API names, whether the flow is expected or unexpected, and
to inform developers only about the latter. We present a general framework and
instantiate it with four learned models, which offer different trade-offs
between the need to annotate training data and the accuracy of predictions. We
implement Fluffy on top of the CodeQL analysis framework and apply it to 250K
JavaScript projects. Evaluating on five common vulnerability types, we find
that Fluffy achieves an F1 score of 0.85 or more on four of them across a
variety of datasets.

updating a machine learning driven application. It allows to seamlessly improve
the underlying model without introducing regression bugs. In classification
tasks these bugs occur in the form of negative flips. This means an instance
that was correctly classified by the old model is now classified incorrectly by
the updated model. This has direct negative impact on the user experience of
such systems e.g. a frequently used voice assistant query is suddenly
misclassified. A common reason to update the model is when new training data
becomes available and needs to be incorporated. Simply retraining the model
with the updated data introduces the unwanted negative flips. We study the
problem of regression during data updates and propose Backward Compatible
Weight Interpolation (BCWI). This method interpolates between the weights of
the old and new model and we show in extensive experiments that it reduces
negative flips without sacrificing the improved accuracy of the new model. BCWI
is straight forward to implement and does not increase inference cost. We also
explore the use of importance weighting during interpolation and averaging the
weights of multiple new models in order to further reduce negative flips.

detections allow us to put stringent constraints on the brightness temperature
that clearly favour a non-thermal emission mechanism. The radio emission is
interpreted and modelled as synchrotron emission from the shock interaction
between the nova ejecta and the circumbinary medium. The light curve shows a
plateauing behaviour after the first peak, which can be explained by either a
non-uniform density of the circumbinary medium or a second emission component.
Allowing for a second component in the light curve modelling captures the steep
decay at late times. Furthermore, extrapolating this model to 15 years after
the outburst shows that the radio emission might not fully disappear between
outbursts. Further modelling of the light curves indicates a red giant mass
loss rate of $\sim 5 \cdot 10^{-8}~{\rm M_\odot~yr^{-1}}$. The spectrum cannot
be modelled in detail at this stage, as there are likely at least four emission

and H13CO+ trace the filament seen in the $N_{H_2}$ data. The radial profile
from the $N_{H_2}$ data shows $D_{HP}$~0.081 pc, which is similar to the
Herschel findings. The $D_{HP}$ from 13CO and C18O are broader, while the
$D_{HP}$ from H13CO+ is narrower, than $D_{HP}$ from Herschel. These results
suggest that 13CO and C18O trace only the outer part of the filament and H13CO+
only the inner part. The H13CO+ $V_{centroid}$ map reveals $V$ gradients along
both filament axis, as well as $V$ oscillations with a period $\lambda$~0.2 pc
along the major axis. Comparison between the $V$ and the $n$ distribution shows
a tentative $\lambda$/4 shift in H13CO+ or C18O. This $\lambda$/4 shift is not
simultaneously observed for all cores in any single tracer but is tentatively
seen in either H13CO+ or C18O. We produced a toy model taking into account a
transverse $V$ gradient, a longitudinal $V$ gradient, and a longitudinal
oscillation mode caused by fragmentation. Examination of synthetic data shows
that the oscillation component produces an oscillation pattern in the velocity
structure function (VSF) of the model. The H13CO+ VSF shows an oscillation
pattern, suggesting that our observations are partly tracing core-forming
motions and fragmentation. We also found that the mean $M_{core}$ corresponds
to the effective $M_{BE}$ in the filament. This is consistent with a scenario
in which higher-mass cores form in higher line-mass filaments.

systematic literature searches, snowballing, and thematic synthesis. We found
out (1) which validity threat categories are most often discussed in primary
studies of code comprehension, and we collected evidence to build (2) the
evidence profiles for the three most commonly reported threats to validity.
  We discovered that few mentions of validity threats in primary studies (31 of
409) included a reference to supporting evidence. For the three most commonly
mentioned threats, namely the influence of programming experience, program
length, and the selected comprehension measures, almost all cited studies (17
of 18) did not meet our criteria for evidence. We show that for many threats to
validity that are currently assumed to be influential across all studies, their
actual impact may depend on the design and context of each specific study.
  Researchers should discuss threats to validity within the context of their
particular study and support their discussions with evidence. The present paper
can be one resource for evidence, and we call for more meta-studies of this
type to be conducted, which will then inform design decisions in primary
studies. Further, although we have applied our methodology in the context of
program comprehension, our approach can also be used in other SE research areas

With the help of this method, it is possible to use trainable weights based on

all components of vector constants while keeping the output components between

distance of at most two. A \emph{strong proper connected} coloring of $G$ is
the one in which every pair of vertices is joined by at least one strongly

\emph{nonrepetitive}, that is, it does not contain two adjacent identical

not well documented. This paper systematically investigates the effect of
different batching strategies and batch sizes on the training statistics and
speech enhancement performance of a Conv-TasNet, evaluated in both matched and
mismatched conditions. We find that using a small batch size during training
improves performance in both conditions for all batching strategies. Moreover,
using sorted or bucket batching with a dynamic batch size allows for reduced
training time and GPU memory usage while achieving similar performance compared
to random batching with a fixed batch size.

giving the range of distances and the extinction law for each cirrus. The
distances in the range 140--415 pc found are consistent with the 3D reddening

consistent with the estimates from Schlegel+1998 for the Cardelli+1989

and wavelength with its own coefficient for each cirrus. In one of the cirri
our results suggest a very slight decrease in extinction with wavelength, i.e.,
a large contribution of gray extinction. In the remaining cirri a manifestation
of gray extinction is not ruled out either. This is consistent with the

Earlier, a framework named DisCoCirc was sketched that (1) is compositional and
distributional (a.k.a. vectorial); (2) applies to general text; (3) captures
linguistic `connections' between meanings (cf. grammar) (4) updates word
meanings as text progresses; (5) structures sentence types; (6) accommodates
ambiguity. Here, we realise DisCoCirc for a substantial fragment of English.
  When passing to DisCoCirc's text circuits, some `grammatical bureaucracy' is
eliminated, that is, DisCoCirc displays a significant degree of (7) inter- and
intra-language independence. That is, e.g., independence from word-order
conventions that differ across languages, and independence from choices like
many short sentences vs. few long sentences. This inter-language independence
means our text circuits should carry over to other languages, unlike the
language-specific typings of categorial grammars. Hence, text circuits are a
lean structure for the `actual substance of text', that is, the inner-workings
of meanings within text across several layers of expressiveness (cf. words,
sentences, text), and may capture that what is truly universal beneath grammar.
The elimination of grammatical bureaucracy also explains why DisCoCirc: (8)
applies beyond language, e.g. to spatial, visual and other cognitive modes.
While humans could not verbally communicate in terms of text circuits, machines
can.
  We first define a `hybrid grammar' for a fragment of English, i.e. a
purpose-built, minimal grammatical formalism needed to obtain text circuits. We
then detail a translation process such that all text generated by this grammar
yields a text circuit. Conversely, for any text circuit obtained by freely
composing the generators, there exists a text (with hybrid grammar) that gives
rise to it. Hence: (9) text circuits are generative for text.

neural networks remain brittle and susceptible to many changes in the image
that do not cause humans to misclassify images. Part of this different behavior
may be explained by the type of features humans and deep neural networks use in
vision tasks. Humans tend to classify objects according to their shape while
deep neural networks seem to rely mostly on texture. Exploring this question is
relevant, since it may lead to better performing neural network architectures
and to a better understanding of the workings of the vision system of primates.
In this work, we advance the state of the art in our understanding of this

Adaptation (UDA) for Multi-Label Image Classification (MLIC) referred to as
DDA-MLIC is proposed. Over the last two years, some attempts have been made for
introducing adversarial-based UDA methods in the context of MLIC. However,
these methods which rely on an additional discriminator subnet present two
shortcomings. First, the learning of domain-invariant features may harm their
task-specific discriminative power, since the classification and discrimination
tasks are decoupled. Moreover, the use of an additional discriminator usually
induces an increase of the network size. Herein, we propose to overcome these
issues by introducing a novel adversarial critic that is directly deduced from
the task-specific classifier. Specifically, a two-component Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM) is fitted on the source and target predictions, allowing the
distinction of two clusters. This allows extracting a Gaussian distribution for
each component. The resulting Gaussian distributions are then used for
formulating an adversarial loss based on a Frechet distance. The proposed
method is evaluated on three multi-label image datasets. The obtained results
demonstrate that DDA-MLIC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods while
requiring a lower number of parameters.

asymptotic giant branch stars. We find 2829 M-type stars and 57 C stars. The
carbon stars are likely contaminants from M31. If carbon stars are present in
M32 they are so in very low numbers. The uncorrected C/M ratio is 0.020 $\pm$
0.003; this drops to less than 0.007 after taking into account contamination
from M31. As the mean metallicity of M32 is just below solar, this low ratio of
C to M stars is unlikely due to a metallicity ceiling for the formation of
carbon stars. Instead, the age of the AGB population is likely to be the
primary factor. The ratio of AGB to RGB stars in M32 is similar to that of the
inner disc of M31 which contain stars that formed 1.5--4 Gyr ago. If the M32
population is at the older end of this age then its lack of C-stars may be
consistent with a narrow mass range for carbon star formation predicted by some
stellar evolution models. Applying our chemical classifications to the dusty
variable stars identified with {\em Spitzer}, we find that the x-AGB candidates
identified with {\em Spitzer} are predominately M-type stars. This
substantially increases the lower limit to the cumulative dust-production rate

multi-dimensional GP regression with activity indicators as ancillary time

communications has motivated the need for novel spectrum sharing solutions at
these high frequencies. In fact, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)
have recently emerged to enable spectrum sharing while enhancing the
incumbents' quality-of-service (QoS). Nonetheless, co-existence over mmWave
bands remains persistently challenging due to their unfavorable propagation
characteristics. Hence, initiating mmWave spectrum sharing requires the RIS to
further assist in improving the QoS over mmWave bands without jeopardizing
spectrum sharing demands. In this paper, a novel simultaneous transmitting and
reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS)-aided solution to enable mmWave spectrum sharing is
proposed. In particular, the transmitting and reflecting abilities of the
STAR-RIS are leveraged to tackle the mmWave spectrum sharing and QoS
requirements separately. The STAR-RIS-enabled spectrum sharing problem between
a primary network (e.g. a radar transmit-receive pair) and a secondary network
is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the downlink
sum-rate over a secondary multiple-input-single-output (MISO) network, while
limiting interference over a primary network. Moreover, the STAR-RIS response
coefficients and beamforming matrix in the secondary network are jointly
optimized. To solve this non-convex problem, an alternating iterative algorithm
is employed, where the STAR-RIS response coefficients and beamforming matrix
are obtained using the successive convex approximation method. Simulation
results show that the proposed solution outperforms conventional RIS schemes
for mmWave spectrum sharing by achieving a 14.57% spectral efficiency gain.

computation resource allocation is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear

tradeoff. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem with coupled and

complexity. To tackle this challenge, we first decouple the formulated problem
into a power allocation, task assignment and computation resource allocation
(PATACRA) subproblem. Then, with the solution obtained from the PATACRA
subproblem, we equivalently reformulate the original problem as a discrete user

Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed algorithms are guaranteed

bijection with the non-negative tropical points of the unipotent group of $G$.
By fixing $w$ from the Weyl group, we can define MV polytopes whose highest
vertex is labelled by $w$. We show that these polytopes are in bijection with
the non-negative tropical points of the reduced double Bruhat cell labelled by
$w^{-1}$. To do this, we define a collection of generalized minor functions
$\Delta_\gamma^\text{new}$ which tropicalize on the reduced Bruhat cell to the
BZ data of an MV polytope of highest vertex $w$.
  We also describe the combinatorial structure of MV polytopes of highest
vertex $w$. We explicitly describe the map from the Weyl group to the subset of
elements bounded by $w$ in the Bruhat order which sends $u \mapsto v$ if the
vertex labelled by $u$ coincides with the vertex labelled by $v$ for every MV
polytope of highest vertex $w$. As a consequence of this map, we prove that
these polytopes have vertices labelled by Weyl group elements less than $w$ in
the Bruhat order.

flexibility in electrical power load. However, few works have considered the
vulnerability of spot pricing to financial fraud via false data injection (FDI)

consumer load profile to exploit intraday price dips. We examine an anomaly
detection protocol for cyber-attacks that seek to leverage spot prices for
financial gain. In this way we outline a methodology for detecting attacks on
industrial load smart meters. We first create a feature clustering model of the
underlying business, segregated by business type. We then use these clusters to
create an incentive-weighted anomaly detection protocol for false data attacks
against load profiles. This clustering-based methodology incorporates both the
load profile and spot pricing considerations for the detection of injected load
profiles. To reduce false positives, we model incentive-based detection, which
includes knowledge of spot prices, into the anomaly tracking, enabling the
methodology to account for changes in the load profile which are unlikely to be
attacks.

novel concept of cyber deception has emerged. Starting from the well-known
example of honeypots, many other deception strategies have been developed such
as honeytokens and moving target defense, all sharing the objective of creating
uncertainty for attackers and increasing the chance for the attacker of making
mistakes. In this paper a methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of
honeypots and moving target defense in a network is presented. This methodology
allows to quantitatively measure the effectiveness in a simulation environment,
allowing to make recommendations on how many honeypots to deploy and on how
quickly network addresses have to be mutated to effectively disrupt an attack
in multiple network and attacker configurations. With this optimum, attacks can
be detected and slowed down with a minimal resource and configuration overhead.
With the provided methodology, the optimal number of honeypots to be deployed
and the optimal network address mutation interval can be determined.
Furthermore, this work provides guidance on how to optimally deploy and
configure them with respect to the attacker model and several network

Marginal Structural Models (MSMs) provide a way to summarize such target

As an additional benefit, the use of the SBM prior infers and clusters users

assessing the nutrient content of food items with an exclusive focus on caloric
intake. There are two primary impediments that can be noted in these studies.
The first of these relates to the fact that caloric intake of each food item is
calculated from an existing database. The second concerns the scientific
significance of caloric intake used as the single measure of nutrient content.
By requiring an existing database, researchers are forced to find some source
of a comprehensive set of food items as well as their respective nutrients.
This search alone is a difficult task, and if completed often leads to the
requirement of a paid API service. These services are expensive and
non-customizable, taking away funding that could be aimed at other parts of the
study only to give an unwieldy database that can not be modified or contributed
to. In this work, we introduce a new rendition of the USDA's food database that
includes both foods found in grocery stores and those found in restaurants or
fast food places. At the moment, we have accumulated roughly 1.5 million food
entries consisting of approximately 18,000 brands and 100 restaurants in the
United States. These foods also have an abundance of nutrient data associated
with them, from the caloric amount to saturated fat levels. The data is stored
in MySQL format and is spread among five major tables. We have also procured
images for theses foods entries when available, and have included all of our

from an evaporating liquid. Eventually, after formation and upon cooling, the
vapor layer cannot be sustained and undergoes a violent collapse evidenced by
explosive boiling. Computationally, modeling this instability involves an
interplay between hydrodynamics, thermodynamics, rapid evaporation, and
length-scales from $\mu$m to cm. Selective assumptions, made to reduce
computational costs, have limited most previous studies to steady-state
investigations. Here, we combine two-phase laminar flow, heat transfer, and
evaporation in a finite-element simulation to examine the failure of
Leidenfrost vapor layers during cooling. During periods of quiescence, the
geometry of the vapor layer agrees well with steady-state lubrication theory.
In the simulations, we report the local temperature of the solid at failure,
$T_-$, which provides a lower bound for recent experimental work using the same
geometric and material conditions. Surprisingly, we find that inertial forces,
which are typically ignored in theoretical treatments of the vapor layer, are
responsible for initiating the instability leading to failure.

  quantification of corneal anisotropic elasticity: in vivo rabbit study","33 pages main paper, 22 pages supplemental content",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Purpose. To demonstrate accurate measurement of corneal elastic moduli in
vivo with non-contact and non-invasive optical coherence elastography. Methods.
Elastic properties (in-plane Young's modulus E and both in-plane, u, and
out-of-plane, G, shear moduli) of rabbit cornea were quantified in vivo using
non-contact dynamic Acoustic micro-Tapping Optical Coherence Elastography
(AuT-OCE). The IOP-dependence of measured mechanical properties was explored in
extracted whole globes following in vivo measurement. A nearly-incompressible
transverse isotropic (NITI) model was used to reconstruct moduli from AuT-OCE
data. Independently, cornea elastic moduli were also measured ex vivo with
traditional, destructive mechanical tests (tensile extensometry and shear
rheometry). Results. Our study demonstrates strong anisotropy of corneal
elasticity in rabbits. The in-plane Young's modulus, computer as E=3u, was in
the range of 20-44 MPa, whereas the out-of-plane shear modulus was in the range
of 34-261 kPa. Both pressure-dependent ex vivo OCE and destructive mechanical
tests performed on the same samples within an hour of euthanasia strongly
support the results of AuT-OCE measurements. Conclusions. Non-contact AuT-OCE
can non-invasively quantify cornea anisotropic elastic properties in vivo.
Translational Relevance. As OCT is broadly accepted in Ophthalmology, these
results suggest the potential for rapid translation of AuT-OCE into clinical
practice. In addition, AuT-OCE can likely improve diagnostic criteria of
ectatic corneal diseases, leading to early diagnosis, reduced complications,
customized surgical treatment, and personalized biomechanical models of the
eye.

both boundaries of the ordinary dielectric slab. It is shown that, for a given
set of parameters describing the system, a phase transition-like anomalous
behavior of Faraday and Kerr rotation angles in a parity-time symmetric systems
can take place. In the anomalous phase the value of one of the Faraday and Kerr
rotation angles can become negative, and both angles suffer from spectral
singularities and give a strong enhancement near the singularities. We also
shown that the real part of the complex angle of KR, $\theta^{R}_1$, is always
equal to the $\theta^{T}_1$ of FR, no matter what phase the system is in due to
the symmetry constraints. The imaginary part of KR angles $\theta^{R^{r/l}}_2$
are related to the $\theta^{T}_2$ of FR by parity-time symmetry. Calculations
based on the approach of the generalized nonperturbative characteristic
determinant, which is valid for a layered system with randomly distributed
delta potentials, show that the Faraday and Kerr rotation spectrum in such

peaks, providing simultaneous large Faraday and Kerr rotations enhanced by an
order one or two of magnitude. We provide a recipe for funding a one-to-one

more likely to be gravitational unbound, than cores formed from non-colliding

heterogeneity by jointly considering phenotypic and genetic data, thereby
conferring genetic correlations to the disease subtypes and associated

interpretability, and robustness of Gene-SGAN in semi-synthetic experiments. We
then demonstrate its application to real multi-site datasets from 28,858

associated with hypertension, from MRI and SNP data. Derived brain phenotypes
displayed significant differences in neuroanatomical patterns, genetic

biology. In this review, we will discuss three mathematical approaches for
studying cancer biology: population dynamics, gene regulation, and
developmental biology. If we understand all biochemical mechanisms of cancer
cells, we can directly calculate how the cancer cell population behaves.
Inversely, just from the cell count data, we can use population dynamics to
infer the mechanisms. Cancer cells emerge from certain genetic mutations, which
affect the expression of other genes through gene regulation. Therefore,
knowledge of gene regulation can help with cancer prevention and treatment.
Developmental biology studies acquisition and maintenance of normal cellular
function, which is inspiring to cancer biology in the opposite direction.
Besides, cancer cells implanted into an embryo can differentiate into normal
tissues, which provides a possible approach of curing cancer. This review
illustrates the role of mathematics in these three fields: what mathematical
models are used, what data analysis tools are applied, and what mathematical
theorems need to be proved. We hope that applied mathematicians and even pure
mathematicians can find meaningful mathematical problems related to cancer

data cover $0.9 - 59.9$\,days from the time of \textit{Swift} and
\textit{Fermi} GRB detections. Photometry in $rizy$-band filters was collected
primarily with Pan-STARRS and supplemented by multiple 1- to 4-meter imaging
facilities. We analyzed the Swift X-ray data of the afterglow and found a
single decline rate power-law $f(t) \propto t^{-1.556\pm0.002}$ best describes
the light curve. In addition to the high foreground Milky Way dust extinction
along this line of sight, the data favour additional extinction to consistently
model the optical to X-ray flux with optically thin synchrotron emission. We
fit the X-ray-derived power-law to the optical light curve and find good
agreement with the measured data up to $5-6$\,days. Thereafter we find a flux
excess in the $riy$ bands which peaks in the observer frame at $\sim20$\,days.
This excess shares similar light curve profiles to the type Ic broad-lined
supernovae SN~2016jca and SN~2017iuk once corrected for the GRB redshift of
$z=0.151$ and arbitrarily scaled. This may be representative of a supernova
emerging from the declining afterglow. We measure rest-frame absolute peak AB
magnitudes of $M_g=-19.8\pm0.6$ and $M_r=-19.4\pm0.3$ and $M_z=-20.1\pm0.3$. If
this is an SN component, then Bayesian modelling of the excess flux would imply
explosion parameters of $M_{\rm ej}=7.1^{+2.4}_{-1.7}$ M$_{\odot}$, $M_{\rm
Ni}=1.0^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$ M$_{\odot}$, and $v_{\rm ej}=33,900^{+5,900}_{-5,700}

inferring an explosion energy of $E_{\rm kin}\simeq 2.6-9.0\times10^{52}$ ergs.

here is to identify the group activity among the nursing home's residents and
to detect if they have any deviated activity behavior. We propose a
location-based deviated activity behavior detection system to detect deviated
activity behavior by leveraging data fusion technique. In order to compute the
features for data fusion, an adaptive method is applied for extracting the
group and individual activity time and generate daily hybrid norm for each of
the residents. Next, deviated activity behavior detection is executed by
considering the difference between daily norm patterns and daily input data for
each resident. Lastly, the deviated activity behavior among the residents are
classified using a rule-based classification approach. Through the
implementation, there are 44.4% of the residents do not have deviated activity
behavior , while 37% residents involved in one deviated activity behavior and
18.6% residents have two or more deviated activity behaviors.

Leveraging semantic communication for reducing information redundancy, VSPs can
receive semantic data from edge devices to provide varied services through
advanced techniques, e.g., AI-Generated Content (AIGC), for users to explore
digital worlds. But the use of semantic communication raises a security issue
because attackers could send malicious semantic data with similar semantic

wrong output of AIGC. Therefore, in this paper, we first propose a
blockchain-aided semantic communication framework for AIGC services in virtual
transportation networks to facilitate interactions of the physical and virtual

semantic attack scheme to generate adversarial semantic data by various loss

similarities of adversarial and authentic semantic data and to check the
authenticity of semantic data transformations. Simulation results show that the
proposed defense method can reduce the semantic similarity of the adversarial
semantic data and the authentic ones by up to 30% compared with the attack

on whether humans can appropriately rely on them. Recent research has shown
that appropriate reliance is the key to achieving complementary team
performance in AI-assisted decision making. This paper addresses an
under-explored problem of whether the Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE) among people
can hinder their appropriate reliance on AI systems. DKE is a metacognitive
bias due to which less-competent individuals overestimate their own skill and
performance. Through an empirical study (N = 249), we explored the impact of
DKE on human reliance on an AI system, and whether such effects can be
mitigated using a tutorial intervention that reveals the fallibility of AI
advice, and exploiting logic units-based explanations to improve user
understanding of AI advice. We found that participants who overestimate their
performance tend to exhibit under-reliance on AI systems, which hinders optimal
team performance. Logic units-based explanations did not help users in either
improving the calibration of their competence or facilitating appropriate
reliance. While the tutorial intervention was highly effective in helping users
calibrate their self-assessment and facilitating appropriate reliance among
participants with overestimated self-assessment, we found that it can
potentially hurt the appropriate reliance of participants with underestimated
self-assessment. Our work has broad implications on the design of methods to
tackle user cognitive biases while facilitating appropriate reliance on AI

self-assessment in shaping trust and reliance in human-AI decision making. This

projects, departments, and organizations lead to the development of duplicate
and suboptimal code. Building on top of open-source software requires critical
appraisal and risk-based assessment of the used modules. Code that is written
needs to be readable to ensure reliable software. The software needs to be
easily understandable for the user, as well as developed within testing
frameworks to ensure that long term maintenance of the software is feasible.
Finally, the reproducibility of research results is hindered by manual analysis
workflows and uncontrolled code development. We next describe how the awareness
of the importance and application of good software engineering practices and
strategies can help address these challenges. The foundation is a better
education in basic software engineering skills in schools, universities, and

institutions and companies can be a key factor for the establishment of good

regulation through self-regulation of amygdala. Recently, rtfMRI studies have
observed that regulation of a target brain region is accompanied by
connectivity changes beyond the target region. Therefore, the aim of present
study is to investigate the use of connectivity between amygdala and prefrontal
regions as the target of neurofeedback training in healthy individuals and
subjects with a life-time history of major depressive disorder (MDD) performing
an emotion regulation task. Method: Ten remitted MDD subjects and twelve
healthy controls (HC) performed an emotion regulation task in 4 runs of
rtfMRI-nf training followed by one transfer run without neurofeedback conducted
in a single session. The functional connectivity between amygdala and
prefrontal cortex was presented as a feedback bar concurrent with the emotion
regulation task. Participants' emotional state was measured by the Positive and
Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) prior to and following the rtfMRI-nf.
Psychological assessments were used to determine subjects' history of
depression. Results: Participants with a history of MDD showed a trend of
decreasing functional connectivity across the four rtfMRI-nf runs, and there
was a marginally significant interaction between the MDD history and number of
training runs. The HC group showed a significant increase of frontal cortex
activation between the second and third neurofeedback runs. Comparing PANAS
scores before and after connectivity-based rtfMRI-nf, we observed a significant
decrease in negative PANAS score in the whole group overall, and a significant
decrease in positive PANAS score in the MDD group alone.

systems, ethylene is eliminated with the production of either keto or enol
tautomer. The six-membered transition state structure encountered in the path
of keto formation is much lower in energy than the fourmembered transition
state required to give enol form. Rate constants and activation energies for
the decomposition of 1-EisoQ, 2-EQ, 3-EQ, 3-EisoQ, 4-EQ, 4-EisoQ, 5-EQ,

pressures using conventional transition state theory combined with Eckart
tunneling (TST/Eck) and the statistical Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM)
theories. The tunneling correction is significant at temperatures up to 1000 K.
Rate constants results reveal that ethylene elimination with keto production is
favored kinetically and thermodynamically over the whole temperature range of
400-1200 K and the rates of the processes under study increase with the rising

Nebula observed with X-ray astronomy satellites, ASCA, RXTE, Suzaku, NuSTAR,
and Hitomi. The combination of the five satellites provides a time period of 28
yr from 1994 to 2022. To suppress seasonal and latitudinal variations, we
concentrate on the data taken in autumn (49< doy <111) and spring (235< doy
<297) in the northern hemisphere with latitudes of 0--40 degrees. With this
constraint, local times are automatically limited either around noon or
midnight. We obtain four sets (two seasons times two local times) of density
trends at each altitude layer. We take into account variations due to a linear
trend and the 11-yr solar cycle using linear regression techniques. Because we
do not see significant differences among the four trends, we combine them to
provide a single vertical profile of trend slopes. We find a negative density
trend of roughly -5 %/decade at every altitude. This is in reasonable agreement
with inferences from settling rate of the upper atmosphere. In the 100--110 km
altitude, we found an exceptionally high density decline of about -12 %/decade.
This peak may be the first observational evidence for strong cooling due to
water vapor and ozone near 110 km, which was first identified in a numerical
simulation by Akmaev et al. (2006). Further observations and numerical
simulations with suitable input parameters are needed to establish this
feature.

  arXiv:2206.00006",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The bipartite graph is a powerful data structure for modeling interactions
between two types of nodes, of which a fundamental challenge is how to extract
informative node embeddings. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a promising
paradigm to address this challenge. Most recent bipartite graph SSL methods are
based on contrastive learning which learns embeddings by discriminating
positive and negative node pairs. Contrastive learning usually requires a large
number of negative node pairs, which could lead to computational burden and
semantic errors. In this paper, we introduce a novel synergistic representation
learning model (STERLING) to learn node embeddings without negative node pairs.
STERLING preserves the unique synergies in bipartite graphs. The local and
global synergies are captured by maximizing the similarity of the inter-type
and intra-type positive node pairs, and maximizing the mutual information of
co-clusters respectively. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that STERLING could
preserve the synergies in the embedding space. Extensive empirical evaluation
on various benchmark datasets and tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of
STERLING for extracting node embeddings.

the Mandelstam-Tamm bound and the Margolus-Levitin bound. This implies that any
interaction has to be smeared over such an interval, and any interaction in the

positives. All these breath samples have been converted into numeric values
through five air sensors. 10% of the data have been used for the validation of
the model, while 75% of the test data have been used for training an AI model
to predict the coronavirus presence. 25% have been used for testing. The SMOTE
oversampling method was used to increase the training set size and reduce the
imbalance of negative and positive classes in training and test data. Different
machine learning algorithms have also been tried to develop the e-nose model.
The test results have suggested that the Gradient Boosting algorithm created

critical steps in image processing. X-ray images are created by photons
colliding with atoms and the variation in scattered noise absorption. This
noise causes the graph's quality of medical to decline and, occasionally,
causes it to repeat itself, causing an elevation in the patient's effective
dose. One of the most critical challenges in this area has consistently been
lowering the image noise. Techniques like BM3d, low-pass filters, and
Autoencoder have taken this step. Due to the algorithm's structure and high
repetition rate, neural networks using various architectures have reduced noise
with acceptable results over the past ten years compared to the traditional
BM3D and low-pass filters. The Hankel matrix combined with neural networks is
one of these configurations. The Hankel matrix seeks a local circle by
splitting up individual values into local and non-local components using a
non-local matrix. A non-local matrix can be created using the wave or DCT. This
paper proposes combining the waveform with the Daubechies (D4) wavelength
because it has more energy and uses the u-Net neural network structure, which
uses the waveform alone at each stage. The outcomes were evaluated using the
PSNR and SSIM criteria, and the outcomes were verified by using various waves.
The effectiveness of a one-wave network has increased from 0.5% to 1.2%,

has increased due to higher accuracy requirements. Additionally, more
simulation data is required to allow data analysts to spot Standard Model
deviations in observations of real data and enable the filtering of rare

and analysis of real data, distributed computing approaches are commonly
employed. For instance, CERN relies on the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG)
in order to be able to store, process, distribute and analyze collision data.
Since not every HEP experiment has access to these resources and the addition
of new Grid servers is a complex process, this publication explores a novel
distributed computing approach for HEP which is based on blockchain technology.
It features the description of a novel Proof-of-Useful-Work consensus algorithm
which aims to both support real-world HEP experiments with the production of

remaining unexplored spectral window to be probed with present-day

mass-loss studies owing to the strong resonance lines and large photospheric
flux. Overall, from a low-resolution analysis ($R=50$) we found that the
planet's near-ultraviolet spectrum is well characterized by a relatively flat
baseline, consistent with the optical-infrared transmission, plus two regions
at $\sim$2350 and $\sim$2600 {\AA} that exhibit a broad and significant excess
absorption above the continuum. From an analysis at a higher resolution
($R=4700$), we found that the transit depths at the core of the magnesium
resonance lines are consistent with the surrounding continuum. We discarded the
presence of \ion{Mg}{ii} absorption in the upper atmosphere at a
$\sim$2--4$\sigma$ confidence level, whereas we could place no significant
constraint for \ion{Mg}{i} absorption. These broad absorption features coincide
with the expected location of \ion{Fe}{ii} bands; however, solar-abundance
hydrodynamic models of the upper atmosphere are not able to reproduce the
amplitude of these features with iron absorption. Such scenario would require a
combination of little to no iron condensation in the lower-atmosphere,
super-solar metallicities, and a mechanism to enhance the absorption features
(such as zonal wind broadening). The true nature of this feature remains to be
confirmed.

fractions of solids, owing to ramified space-spanning networks that form due to
particle-particle interactions. These networks give the gel its rigidity, and
as the attraction between the particles grows, so does the elasticity of the
colloidal network formed. The emergence of this rigidity can be described
through a mean field approach; nonetheless, fundamental understanding of how
rigidity varies in gels of different attraction strengths is lacking. Moreover,
recovering an accurate gelation phase diagram based on the system's variables
have been an extremely challenging task. Understanding the nature of these
fractal clusters, and how rigidity emerges from their connections is key to
controlling and designing gels with desirable properties. Here, we employ
well-established concepts of network science to interrogate and characterize
the network of colloidal gels. We construct a particle-level network, having
all the spatial coordinates of colloids with different attraction levels, and
also identify polydisperse rigid fractal clusters using a Gaussian Mixture
Model, to form a coarse-grained cluster network that distinctly shows main
physical features of the colloidal gels. A simple mass-spring model then is
used to recover quantitatively the elasticity of colloidal gels from these
cluster networks. Interrogating the resilience of these gel networks show that
the elasticity of a gel (a dynamic property) is directly correlated to its
cluster network's resilience (a static measure). Finally, we use the resilience
investigations to devise [and experimentally validate] a fully resolved phase
diagram for colloidal gelation, with a clear solid-liquid phase boundary using
a single volume fraction of particles well beyond this phase boundary.

most effective information to claim that defenses have been tested against a
representative attack set. To this extent, we select image quality metrics from
the state of the art and search correlations between image perturbation and
detectability. We observe that computing L-norms alone is rarely the preferable

computed on an adversarial image and the output of a detector on such an image,
to the extent that they can predict the response of a detector with
approximately 0.94 accuracy. Further, we observe that metrics can classify
attacks based on similar perturbations and similar detectability. This suggests
a possible review of the approach to evaluate detectors, where additional

provide a procedure, based on constructing an equivalent wave mechanics, for

finite. We provide an example based on a second-order plus fourth-order scalar
field theory, a prototype for quantum gravity, in which it is not. In this
example the Minkowski path integral with a real measure diverges though the
Euclidean path integral does not. Thus in this example contributions from the
Wick rotation contour cannot be ignored. Since $\langle \Omega\vert
\Omega\rangle$ is not finite, use of the standard Feynman rules is not valid.
And while these rules not only lead to states with negative norm, they in fact
lead to states with infinite negative norm. However, if the fields in that
theory are continued into the complex plane, we show that then there is a
domain in the complex plane known as a Stokes wedge in which one can define an
appropriate time-independent, positive and finite inner product, viz. the
$\langle L\vert R\rangle$ overlap of left-eigenstates and right-eigenstates of
the Hamiltonian; with the vacuum state then being normalizable, and with there
being no states with negative or infinite $\langle L\vert R\rangle$ norm. In
this Stokes wedge it is the Euclidean path integral that diverges while the
Minkowski path integral does not. The concerns that we raise in this paper only
apply to bosons since the matrices associated with their creation and

we propose a novel and innovative approach to anomaly detection called Bayesian
State-Space Anomaly Detection(BSSAD). The BSSAD consists of two modules: the
neural network module and the Bayesian state-space module. The design of our
approach combines the strength of Bayesian state-space algorithms in predicting
the next state and the effectiveness of recurrent neural networks and
autoencoders in understanding the relationship between the data to achieve high
accuracy in detecting anomalies. The modular design of our approach allows
flexibility in implementation with the option of changing the parameters of the
Bayesian state-space models or swap-ping neural network algorithms to achieve
different levels of performance. In particular, we focus on using Bayesian
state-space models of particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters. We
conducted extensive experiments on five different datasets. The experimental
results show the superior performance of our model over baselines, achieving an
F1-score greater than 0.95. In addition, we also propose using a metric called

recent direct numerical simulations (DNS) providing full flow data in the key

these DNS into two layers, (iii) an inviscid two-layer shallow water and

hydraulically controlled at the ends of the duct. As the tilt is increased, the
flow becomes everywhere supercritical and unstable to long waves. An internal
undular jump featuring stationary waves first appears near the centre of the
duct, then leads to larger-amplitude travelling waves, and to stronger jumps,
wave breaking and intermittent turbulence at the largest tilt angle. Long waves
described by the (nonlinear) shallow water equation are locally interpreted as
linear waves on a two-layer parallel base flow described by the
Taylor-Goldstein equation. This link helps us interpret long-wave instability

various quantum states. The proposed reconstruction technique allows for a more

to certain localized regions, will likely occur half an hour before perigee and
on the scale of 1 per cent of Apophis's entire surface area. Our models
indicate that the most likely locations to detect tidal resurfacing are:
initially high-sloped regions (> 30 deg) regardless of the encounter
orientation of Apophis, and mid-sloped regions (15 - 30 deg) that experience a
significant positive slope variation (> 0.5 deg), which is mainly controlled by
the encounter orientation. Expected data from ground-based observations of the

into the production, propagation, and hadronization of heavy flavor jets in
ultra-relativistic hadronic and heavy-ion collisions. These measurements across
different colliding systems, like p--A and A--A, help us isolate the possible
modification in particle production due to cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects
and the formation of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), respectively. Jet correlation
studies give direct access to the initial parton dynamics produced in these
collisions.
  This article studies the azimuthal angular correlations of electrons from
heavy flavor hadron decays in pp, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_\rm{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV using PYTHIA8+Angantyr. We study the production
of heavy flavor jets with different parton level processes, including
multi-parton interactions, different color reconnection prescriptions, and
initial and final state radiation processes. In addition, we add the
hadron-level processes, i.e., Bose-Einstein and rescattering effects, to
quantify the effect due to these processes. The heavy flavor electron
correlations are calculated in the different trigger and associated $p_\rm{T}$
intervals to characterize the impact of hard and soft scattering in the various
colliding systems. The yields and the sigmas associated with the near-side (NS)
and away-side (AS) correlation peaks are calculated and studied as a function
of associated $p_\rm{T}^{assoc}$ for different trigger $p_\rm{T}^{e}$ ranges.

estimate accurately the time-domain power and energy of supercapacitors in

Controlling the preference over generated Chinese calligraphy by freezing
randomly sampled parameters in pre-trained models. 3. Using a regularization
method to encourage the models to produce images similar to Chinese paintings.
Furthermore, we conducted a systematic study to explore the performance of
PaCaNet in diversifying fused Chinese painting and calligraphy, which showed
satisfying results. In conclusion, we provide a new direction of creating arts

subwavelength resonators composed from two materials with opposite TO

efforts to provide adequate learning support such as educational question
answering (EQA) to students. An AI system that can enable students to ask
questions via text or voice and get instant answers will make high-quality
education accessible. Despite advances in the field of AI, there exists no
robust benchmark or challenge to enable building such an (EQA) AI within the
African context. Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz competition (NSMQ) is
the perfect competition to evaluate the potential of such an AI due to its wide
coverage of scientific fields, variety of question types, highly competitive
nature, and live, real-world format. The NSMQ is a Jeopardy-style annual live
quiz competition in which 3 teams of 2 students compete by answering questions
across biology, chemistry, physics, and math in 5 rounds over 5 progressive
stages until a winning team is crowned for that year. In this position paper,
we propose the NSMQ AI Grand Challenge, an AI Grand Challenge for Education
using Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz competition (NSMQ) as a case
study. Our proposed grand challenge is to ""Build an AI to compete live in
Ghana's National Science and Maths Quiz (NSMQ) competition and win - performing
better than the best contestants in all rounds and stages of the competition.""
We describe the competition, and key technical challenges to address along with
ideas from recent advances in machine learning that could be leveraged to solve
this challenge. This position paper is a first step towards conquering such a
challenge and importantly, making advances in AI for education in the African
context towards democratizing high-quality education across Africa.

the use of multiple stages of action capsules enhances the ability of the

these bases by building orthogonal or interpolatory projectors onto the

to identify dynamically relevant disturbances, to place point sensors to
measure disturbances, and to design actuators for feedforward control in the
subcritical linearized Ginzburg--Landau equation. Gramian-based response modes
are used to identify coherent structures and for point sensor placement aiming
at state reconstruction in the turbulent flow in a minimal channel at

square-net-derived topological semimetals that allows compositional control of
band filling, and access to different topological states via an evolving charge
density wave (CDW) distortion. Previously studied Gd and Ce members containing
a CDW have shown complex magnetic phase diagrams, which implied that spins
localized on Ln interact with the CDW, but to this date, no magnetic structures
have been solved within the CDW regime of this family of compounds. Here, we
report on the interplay of the CDW with magnetism in $NdSb_{x}Te_{2-x-\delta}$,
by comparing the undistorted square net member $NdSb_{0.94}Te_{0.92}$ with the
CDW-distorted phase $NdSb_{0.48}Te_{1.37}$, via single-crystal x-ray
diffraction, magnetometry, heat capacity, and neutron powder diffraction.
$NdSb_{0.94}Te_{0.92}$ is a collinear antiferromagnet with $T_N$ $\sim$ 2.7 K,
where spins align antiparallel to each other, but parallel to the square net of
the nuclear structure. $NdSb_{0.48}Te_{1.37}$ exhibits a nearly five-fold
modulated CDW ($q_{CDW}=0.18b^*$), isostructural to other
$LnSb_{x}Te_{2-x-\delta}$ at similar x. $NdSb_{0.48}Te_{1.37}$ displays more
complex magnetism with $T_N = 2.3 K$, additional metamagnetic transitions, and
an elliptical cycloid magnetic structure with $q_{mag}=-0.41b^*$.The magnitudes
of $q_{CDW}$ and $q_{mag}$ exhibit a integer relationship,
$1+2q_{mag}=q_{CDW}$, implying a coupling between the CDW and magnetic
structure. Given that the CDW is localized within the nonmagnetic distorted
square net, we propose that conduction electrons ""template"" the spin modulation
via the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction.

multiwavelength observations, their origin can be traced back to the
interaction with eruptions and jets. We present two different case studies as
observational evidence in support of 2.5D MHD numerical experiments that show
that the LAOs in the filament channels can be initiated by solar jets. In the
two studied events, we can identify a quadrupolar configuration with an X-point
at the top of the parasitic region suggestive of a classical null-point. A
reconnection flow emanates from this structure leading to a jet that propagates
along the filament channel. In both cases we can identify the quiescent and
eruptive phases of the jet. The triggered LAOs have periods of around 70-80
minutes and are damped after a few oscillations. The minimum magnetic field
intensity inferred with seismology for the filament turns out to be around 30
Gauss. We conclude that the two case studies are consistent with the recent
numerical model of Luna and Moreno-Insertis (2021), in which the LAOs are
initiated by jets. The relationship between the onset of the jet and filament
oscillations is straight-forward for the first case and less for the second
case. In the second event, although there is some evidence, we cannot rule out
other possibilities such as activity unrelated to the null-point or changes in
the magnetic structure of the filament. Both jets are associated with very weak
flares which did not launch any EUV wave. Therefore the role of EUV waves for
triggering the filament oscillations can be eliminated for these two case.

line. The hardness of this special case is still open. Our algorithm is
potentially extendable to minimum ply covering with other geometric objects

fins, therefore, have seen significant research in the past. With the
developments in metal additive manufacturing, novel design approaches toward
complex geometries are now feasible. To that end, this article presents a
Bayesian optimization approach for designing inline pins that can achieve low
pressure loss. The pin-fin shape is defined using featurized (parametrized)
piecewise cubic splines in 2D. The complexity of the shape is dependent on the
number of splines used for the analysis. From a method development perspective,
the study is performed using three splines. Owing to this piece-wise modeling,
a unique pin fin design is defined using five features. After specifying the
design, a computational fluid dynamics-based model is developed that computes
the pressure drop during the flow. Bayesian optimization is carried out on a
Gaussian processes-based surrogate to obtain an optimal combination of pin-fin
features to minimize the pressure drop. The results show that the optimization
tends to approach an aerodynamic design leading to low pressure drop
corroborating with the existing knowledge. Furthermore, multiple iterations of
optimizations are conducted with varying degree of input data. The results
reveal that a convergence to similar optimal design is achieved with a minimum
of just twenty five initial design-of-experiments data points for the
surrogate. Sensitivity analysis shows that the distance between the rows of the
pin fins is the most dominant feature influencing the pressure drop. In
summary, the newly developed automated framework demonstrates remarkable
capabilities in designing pin fins with superior performance characteristics.

and one $CP$-violating $h_3^V$ form factors ($V=H, Z$). The current CMS
constraints on the $HZZ$ coupling ratios are then used to obtain bounds on the
real part of the anomalous $HZZ$ couplings, which are up to two orders of
magnitude tighter than previous ones, and also on the corresponding absorptive
parts, which are the first one of this kind. The effects of the absorptive
parts of the $HZZ$ anomalous couplings, which have been overlooked in the past,
are analyzed via the partial decay width $\Gamma_{H^\ast\rightarrow ZZ}$, and a
significant deviation from the SM tree-level contribution is observed at low
energies, though it becomes negligible at high energies. We also explore the
possibility that polarized $Z$ gauge bosons are used for the study of non-SM
couplings via a new left-right asymmetry $\mathcal{A}_{LR}$, which is sensitive
to $CP$-violating complex form factors and can be as large as the unity at
best, and in a more conservative scenario it is still larger by five or four
orders of magnitude than the SM prediction arising until the three-loop level.
The partial decay widths $\Gamma_{H^\ast\rightarrow Z_LZ_L}$ and
$\Gamma_{H^\ast\rightarrow Z_RZ_R}$ are also studied in several scenarios and
it is observed that the deviations from the SM results can be large at high
energies and in this case, increases as the energy increases. Thus the use of

Slide preparation heterogeneity and the diversity of scanners lead to poor
model performance when used on data from medical centers not seen during
training. In order to achieve stain invariance in breast invasive carcinoma
patch classification, we implement a stain translation strategy using cycleGANs
for unsupervised image-to-image translation. We compare three cycleGAN-based
approaches to a baseline classification model obtained without any stain
invariance strategy. Two of the proposed approaches use cycleGAN's translations
at inference or training in order to build stain-specific classification
models. The last method uses them for stain data augmentation during training.
This constrains the classification model to learn stain-invariant features.
Baseline metrics are set by training and testing the baseline classification
model on a reference stain. We assessed performances using three medical
centers with H&E and H&E&S staining. Every approach tested in this study
improves baseline metrics without needing labels on target stains. The stain
augmentation-based approach produced the best results on every stain. Each
method's pros and cons are studied and discussed in this paper. However,
training highly performing cycleGANs models in itself represents a challenge.
In this work, we introduce a systematical method for optimizing cycleGAN
training by setting a novel stopping criterion. This method has the benefit of
not requiring any visual inspection of cycleGAN results and proves superiority
to methods using a predefined number of training epochs. In addition, we also
study the minimal amount of data required for cycleGAN training.

under the event horizon, particles always move toward the BH center, they can
only be absorbed but not emitted at the center. This breaks absorption-emission

is fundamental to many downstream tasks in the area of computational pathology
(CPath). In recent years, Deep Learning (DL) methods have been shown to perform
well on segmentation tasks but DL methods generally require a large amount of
pixel-wise annotated data. Pixel-wise annotation sometimes requires expert's
knowledge and time which is laborious and costly to obtain. In this paper, we
present a consistency based semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach that can
help mitigate this challenge by exploiting a large amount of unlabelled data
for model training thus alleviating the need for a large annotated dataset.
However, SSL models might also be susceptible to changing context and features
perturbations exhibiting poor generalisation due to the limited training data.
We propose an SSL method that learns robust features from both labelled and
unlabelled images by enforcing consistency against varying contexts and feature
perturbations. The proposed method incorporates context-aware consistency by
contrasting pairs of overlapping images in a pixel-wise manner from changing
contexts resulting in robust and context invariant features. We show that
cross-consistency training makes the encoder features invariant to different
perturbations and improves the prediction confidence. Finally, entropy
minimisation is employed to further boost the confidence of the final
prediction maps from unlabelled data. We conduct an extensive set of
experiments on two publicly available large datasets (BCSS and MoNuSeg) and
show superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

of experiments in magnetic fields are explained by this model: (1) Reduction
(with respect to standard superconductors) of the thermal broadening of
resistance ($\mathit{TBR}$) in magnetic field $\mathrm{h=H/H_{c2}}$,
$\mathrm{\mathrm{\delta t_{c}(h)}}$, is governed by the small parameter
$\mathrm{C=}$$\mathrm{\xi_{0}}/\mathrm{L}$. The $\mathit{TBR}$ measurements
give, that in $\mathrm{H_{3}S}$ there is a large shift of the irreversible line
$\mathrm{B_{irr}(T)}$ towards the $\mathrm{B_{c2}(T)}$ line. (2) In ZFC (zero
field cooled) experiments on penetration of the magnetic field ($\mathit{PMF}$)
in $\mathrm{H_{3}S}$ [3], the latter reaches the center of a superconducting
disk at much larger external fields, i. e. for $\mathrm{B_{0}\gg B_{c1}}$. The
later is due to the pronounced pinning of vortices, but not to the Meissner

find that MRM offers superior performance in label-efficient fine-tuning. For
instance, MRM achieves 88.5% mean AUC on CheXpert using 1% labeled data,
outperforming previous R$^2$L methods with 100% labels. On NIH ChestX-ray, MRM
outperforms the best performing counterpart by about 3% under small labeling

proposed SeaFormer architecture to image classification problem, demonstrating
the potentials of serving as a versatile mobile-friendly backbone.

density of the Universe at megaparsec and larger scales, but much smaller
scales remain poorly constrained. However, sufficiently large initial
perturbations at small scales can lead to an abundance of ultradense dark
matter minihalos that form during the radiation epoch and survive into the
late-time Universe. Because of their early formation, these objects can be
compact enough to produce detectable microlensing signatures. We investigate
whether the EROS, OGLE, and HSC surveys can probe these halos by fully
accounting for finite source size and extended lens effects. We find that
current data may already constrain the amplitudes of primordial curvature
perturbations in a new region of parameter space, but this conclusion is
strongly sensitive to yet undetermined details about the internal structures of
these ultradense halos. Under optimistic assumptions, current and future HSC
data would constrain a power spectrum that features an enhancement at scales $k
\sim 10^7/{\rm Mpc}$, and an amplitude as low as $\mathcal{P}_\zeta\simeq
10^{-4}$ may be accessible. This is a particularly interesting regime because
it connects to primordial black hole formation in a portion of the
LIGO/Virgo/Kagra mass range and the production of scalar-induced gravitational

prospects motivate further study of the ultradense halo formation scenario to

for several existing and upcoming radio interferometers such as NenuFAR and the
SKA. During this era before the beginning of the Epoch of Reionization, the
signal is more difficult to observe due to brighter foregrounds but reveals
additional information on the underlying astrophysical processes encoded in the
spatial fluctuations of the spin temperature of hydrogen. To interpret future
measurements, controlling the level of accuracy of the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux
modelling is mandatory. In this work, we evaluate the impact of various
approximations that exist in the main fast modelling approach compared to the
results of a costly full radiative transfer simulation. The fast SPINTER code,
presented in this work, computes the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux including the effect
of wing scatterings for an inhomogeneous emissivity field, but assuming an
otherwise homogeneous expanding universe. The LICORICE code computes the full
radiative transfer in the Lyman-$\alpha$ line without any substantial
approximation. We find that the difference between homogeneous and
inhomogeneous gas density and temperature is very small for the computed flux.
On the contrary, neglecting the effect of gas velocities produces a significant
change in the computed flux. We identify the causes (mainly Doppler shifts due
to velocity gradients) and quantify the magnitude of the effect in both an
idealised setup and a realistic cosmological situation. We find that the
amplitude of the effect, up to a factor of $\sim 2$ on the $21$ cm signal power
spectrum on some scales (depending on both other model parameters and the
redshift), can be easily discriminated with an SKA-like survey and already be
approached, particularly for exotic signals, by the ongoing NenuFAR Cosmic Dawn

calculations reveal that the steady state response of a confined harmonic
particle to the magnetic field show interesting features due to the complex
interplay of underlying physical processes such as elastic dissipation and
active fluctuations in the medium. When the activity time scale of the dynamics
is larger than the elastic dissipation timescale (or vice-versa), the steady
state MSD shows an enhancement (or suppression) with increase in the field
strength. In both the cases, for very strong magnetic field the MSD
interestingly approaches the value at the equilibrium limit where the
generalized fluctuation dissipation relation is satisfied and the particle
behaves like an inertial passive Brownian particle. Thus, for a finite magnetic
field, the system exhibits a re-entrant type transition from active to passive

maximum weight of a matching in the subgraph of $G$ induced by the vertices
owned by the players in $S$. If $|V_p|=1$ for all $p\in N$, then we obtain the
classical matching game. Let $c=\max\{|V_p| \; |\; 1\leq p\leq n\}$ be the
width of $(N,v)$. We prove that checking core non-emptiness is polynomial-time
solvable if $c\leq 2$ but co-NP-hard if $c\leq 3$. We do this via pinpointing a
relationship with the known class of $b$-matching games and completing the
complexity classification on testing core non-emptiness for $b$-matching games.
With respect to our application, we prove a number of complexity results on
choosing, out of possibly many optimal solutions, one that leads to a kidney
transplant distribution that is as close as possible to some prescribed fair
distribution.

emission measure weighted temperature (T$_{EM}$) of the CME core by applying
the Differential Emission Measure (DEM) inversion technique on the SDO/AIA six
EUV channels data and compare it with the effective temperature (T$_{eff}$)
obtained using Fe XIII line width measurements. We find that the T$_{eff}$ and
T$_{EM}$ of the CME core show similar variation and remain almost constant as
the CME propagates from ~1.05 to 1.35 R$_{sun}$. The temperature of the CME
core is of the order of million-degree kelvin, indicating that it is not
associated with a prominence. Further, we estimate the electron density of this
CME core using K-Cor polarized brightness (pB) data and found it decreasing by
a factor of ~ 3.6 as the core evolves. An interesting finding is that the
temperature of the CME core remains almost constant despite expected adiabatic
cooling due to the expansion of the CME core, which suggests that the CME core
plasma must be heated as it propagates. We conclude that the expansion of this
CME core behaves more like an isothermal than an adiabatic process.

Particularly rule-based policies such as decision trees and rules lists are

that the learners generate a decision that performs optimally. In this work, we
study the optimization of size-limited decision trees for Markov Decision

expected discounted return for the decision tree using Mixed-Integer Linear

empirically study the optimality gap for existing imitation learning techniques
and find that they perform sub-optimally. We show that this is due to an
inherent shortcoming of imitation learning, namely that complex policies cannot
be represented using size-limited trees. In such cases, it is better to
directly optimize the tree for expected return. While there is generally a
trade-off between the performance and interpretability of machine learning

  Modified angular momentum transport and feedback","21 pages, 11 figures. Submitted to MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The role of magnetic fields in galaxy evolution is still an unsolved question
in astrophysics. We have previously shown that magnetic fields play a crucial
role in major mergers between disc galaxies; in hydrodynamic simulations of
such mergers, the Auriga model produces compact remnants with a distinctive bar
and ring morphology. In contrast, in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations,
remnants form radially-extended discs with prominent spiral arm structure. In
this paper, we analyse a series of cosmological ""zoom-in"" simulations of major
mergers and identify exactly $\textit{how}$ magnetic fields are able to alter
the outcome of the merger. We find that magnetic fields modify the transport of
angular momentum, systematically hastening the merger progress. The impact of
this altered transport depends on the orientation of the field, with a
predominantly azimuthal (non-azimuthal) orientation providing support against
collapse (increasing the central baryonic concentration). Both effects act to
suppress an otherwise existent bar-instability, which in turn leads to a
fundamentally different morphology and manifestation of feedback. We note, in
particular, that stellar feedback is substantially less influential in MHD
simulations, which allows for the later accretion of higher angular momentum
gas and the subsequent rapid radial growth of the remnant disc. A corollary of
the increased baryonic concentration in MHD simulations is that black holes are
able to grow twice as large, although this turns out to have little impact on
the remnant's development. Our results show that galaxy evolution cannot be
modelled correctly without including magnetic fields.

the evolution of the binary system accompanying the cloud composed of the
fastest growing mode, and its impact on the observational signatures,
especially for small mass ratio cases. In this case, the hyperfine resonance,
which has a very small resonance frequency, is relevant. Therefore, due to the
long timescale, we should take into account the decaying process of axions in
the transition destination mode, the backreaction to the orbital motion and the
central BH, and gravitational emission from the cloud. We present a formulation

a star formation history that includes yields from core collapse supernovae,
asymptotic giant branch stars, and supernovae Ia. Evidence for a knee in the
[$\alpha$/Fe] ratios near [Fe/H] $\sim-2.1$ indicates a low star formation
efficiency similar to that in other dwarf galaxies. Given the distance of
Target~1 from the centre of UMi (R$\sim$4.5 kpc), we show that UMi has a more

simulations to follow the isothermal turbulent cascade of purely
gravitationally-driven turbulence from its injection scale down to 0.095 pc for
a gas-poor spiral disk and a gas-rich clumpy disk. To this purpose, and to lift
the memory-footprint technical lock of sufficiently resolving the interstellar

probe self-consistently the self-generated turbulence cascade over three orders

that the turbulent cascade follows the same scaling laws in both setups.
Namely, in both cases the turbulence is close to equipartition between its
compressive and solenoidal modes, the velocity power spectrum follows the
Burgers' scaling and the density power spectrum is rather shallow, with a
power-law slope of -0.7. Last, gravitationally-bound substructures follow a
mass distribution with a -1.8 slope, similar to that of CO clumps. These
simulations thus suggest a universality of gravity-driven isothermal turbulent

with H2 column densities from other sources, we find total H column densities
ranging from 10^20.01 to 10^21.25/cm2. Using deuterium column densities from
FUSE observations we determine the D/H ratio along the sight lines. We confirm
and strengthen the conclusion that D/H is spatially variable over these H I
column density and target distance regimes, which predominantly probe the ISM

Galactic chemical evolution. We also present an analysis of metal lines along
the five sight lines for which we have high resolution spectra and, along with
results reported in the literature, discuss the corresponding column densities

weakly correlated with metal depletion and conclude that the spatial D/H
variability is not solely due to dust depletion. A bifurcation of D/Htot as a
function of depletion at high depletion levels provides modest support that
deuterium-rich gas is infalling onto the Galactic plane.

a persistent displacement in the relative position of an interferometer's test

information about the source. In this work, we explore the implications of
using this information for the parameter estimation of massive binary black
holes with LISA. Based on a Fisher analysis, our results show that the memory

inclination for binaries observed only for a short time (~ few hours) before
merger. To assess how many such short signals will be detected, we utilized
state-of-the-art predictions for the population of massive black hole binaries
and models for the gaps expected in the LISA data. We forecast from tens to few
hundreds of binaries with observable memory, but only ~ O(0.1) events in 4
years for which the memory helps to reduce the degeneracy between distance and
inclination. Based on this, we conclude that the new information from the
non-linear memory, while promising for testing general relativity in the strong
field regime, has probably a limited impact on further constraining the
uncertainty on massive black hole binary parameters with LISA.

highlight the intrinsic connection between standard state tomography and shadow

galaxies.
  Aims. The goal of this work is to quantify how lens galaxies and lensed
sources differ from their parent distribution, namely the strong lensing bias.
  Methods. We first studied how the strong lensing cross-section varies as a
function of lens and source properties. Then, we simulated strong lensing
surveys with data similar to that expected for Euclid and measured the strong
lensing bias in different scenarios. We focused particularly on two quantities:
the stellar population synthesis mismatch parameter, $\alpha_{sps}$, defined as
the ratio between the true stellar mass of a galaxy and the stellar mass
obtained from photometry, and the central dark matter mass at fixed stellar
mass and size.
  Results. Strong lens galaxies are biased towards larger stellar masses,
smaller half-mass radii and larger dark matter masses. The amplitude of the
bias depends on the intrinsic scatter in the mass-related parameters of the
galaxy population and on the completeness in Einstein radius of the lens
sample. For values of the scatter that are consistent with observed scaling
relations and a minimum detectable Einstein radius of $0.5''$, the strong
lensing bias in $\alpha_{sps}$ is $10\%$, while that in the central dark matter
mass is $5\%$. The bias has little dependence on the properties of the source
population: samples of galaxy-galaxy lenses and galaxy-quasar lenses that probe
the same Einstein radius distribution are biased in a very similar way.
Quadruply imaged quasar lenses, however, are biased towards higher ellipticity
galaxies.
  Conclusions. Given current uncertainties, strong lensing observations can be
used directly to improve our current knowledge of the inner structure of
galaxies, without the need to correct for selection effects.

from large variance and high sample complexity. To mitigate this, we introduce
SoftTreeMax -- a generalization of softmax that takes planning into account. In
SoftTreeMax, we extend the traditional logits with the multi-step discounted
cumulative reward, topped with the logits of future states. We consider two
variants of SoftTreeMax, one for cumulative reward and one for exponentiated
reward. For both, we analyze the gradient variance and reveal for the first
time the role of a tree expansion policy in mitigating this variance. We prove
that the resulting variance decays exponentially with the planning horizon as a
function of the expansion policy. Specifically, we show that the closer the
resulting state transitions are to uniform, the faster the decay. In a
practical implementation, we utilize a parallelized GPU-based simulator for
fast and efficient tree search. Our differentiable tree-based policy leverages
all gradients at the tree leaves in each environment step instead of the
traditional single-sample-based gradient. We then show in simulation how the
variance of the gradient is reduced by three orders of magnitude, leading to
better sample complexity compared to the standard policy gradient. On Atari,
SoftTreeMax demonstrates up to 5x better performance in a faster run time
compared to distributed PPO. Lastly, we demonstrate that high reward correlates
with lower variance.

allowed us to create unique mapping and architectural insights. Finally, we

  Programming",,,,,"cs.DS math.CO q-bio.GN","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Many important problems in Bioinformatics (e.g., assembly or multi-assembly)
admit multiple solutions, while the final objective is to report only one. A
common approach to deal with this uncertainty is finding safe partial solutions
(e.g., contigs) which are common to all solutions. Previous research on safety
has focused on polynomially-time solvable problems, whereas many successful and
natural models are NP-hard to solve, leaving a lack of ""safety tools"" for such
problems. We propose the first method for computing all safe solutions for an
NP-hard problem, minimum flow decomposition. We obtain our results by
developing a ""safety test"" for paths based on a general Integer Linear
Programming (ILP) formulation. Moreover, we provide implementations with
practical optimizations aimed to reduce the total ILP time, the most efficient
of these being based on a recursive group-testing procedure.
  Results: Experimental results on the transcriptome datasets of Shao and
Kingsford (TCBB, 2017) show that all safe paths for minimum flow decompositions
correctly recover up to 90% of the full RNA transcripts, which is at least 25%
more than previously known safe paths, such as (Caceres et al. TCBB, 2021),
(Zheng et al., RECOMB 2021), (Khan et al., RECOMB 2022, ESA 2022). Moreover,
despite the NP-hardness of the problem, we can report all safe paths for 99.8%
of the over 27,000 non-trivial graphs of this dataset in only 1.5 hours. Our
results suggest that, on perfect data, there is less ambiguity than thought in
the notoriously hard RNA assembly problem.

address these limitations, we propose conversational APR, a new paradigm for
program repair that alternates between patch generation and validation in a
conversational manner. In conversational APR, we iteratively build the input to
the model by combining previously generated patches with validation feedback.
As such, we leverage the long-term context window of LLMs to not only avoid
generating previously incorrect patches but also incorporate validation

Existing techniques for loss function learning have shown promising results,

However, a significant limitation of these techniques is that the loss
functions are meta-learned in an offline fashion, where the meta-objective only
considers the very first few steps of training, which is a significantly
shorter time horizon than the one typically used for training deep neural

address this issue we propose a new loss function learning technique for
adaptively updating the loss function online after each update to the base

theories for nuclear interactions, the availability of experiments probing
nuclear matter under conditions not reached before, endeavors to develop
sophisticated and reliable transport simulations to interpret these
experiments, and the advent of multi-messenger astronomy, the next decade will
bring new opportunities for determining the nuclear matter EOS, elucidating its
dependence on density, temperature, and isospin asymmetry. Among controlled
terrestrial experiments, collisions of heavy nuclei at intermediate beam
energies (from a few tens of MeV/nucleon to about 25 GeV/nucleon in the
fixed-target frame) probe the widest ranges of baryon density and temperature,
enabling studies of nuclear matter from a few tenths to about 5 times the
nuclear saturation density and for temperatures from a few to well above a
hundred MeV, respectively. Collisions of neutron-rich isotopes further bring
the opportunity to probe effects due to the isospin asymmetry. However,
capitalizing on the enormous scientific effort aimed at uncovering the dense
nuclear matter EOS, both at RHIC and at FRIB as well as at other international
facilities, depends on the continued development of state-of-the-art hadronic
transport simulations. This white paper highlights the role that heavy-ion

strong interactions in dense nuclear matter, with an emphasis on how these
efforts can be used together with microscopic approaches and neutron star
studies to uncover the nuclear EOS.

traditional wavelet-based approaches to analyzing perturbations in financial
signals by scale. In this method, the processes that generate oscillations in
financial signals are modelled as scaled, shifted, and isolated events that
produce ripples of various frequencies across a sea of noise as opposed to a
simple sinusoidal or mixed frequency oscillation or an impulse. This allows one
to directly estimate the wavelet parameters derived only from the generating
functions, rejecting spurious perturbations driven by noise or extraneous
factors. Financial signals may then be reconstructed based on a finite set of
generators localized in time and frequency. This method offers a marked
advantage compared to traditional econometric tools because it directly targets
the generators of oscillations. Furthermore, the choice of the Morse wavelet
allows for wide latitude in capturing a broad set of diverse generators. In
this work, the basic mathematical principles underlying element analysis are
presented, and the method is applied to the study of variance in financial
data, where the advantages of element analysis over traditional wavelet
techniques is demonstrated. Specifically, in the example analysis of inflation
expectations, element analysis shows a clear ability to distinguish between
oscillations formed by noise and those formed by generators logically matched
to historical events.

cities often experience large and early outbreaks, while rural regions follow
after some delay. This hierarchical structure of disease spread is influenced
primarily by the multiscale structure of human mobility. However, during the
COVID-19 epidemic, public health responses typically did not take into
consideration the explicit spatial structure of human mobility when designing
non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). NPIs were applied primarily at
national or regional scales. Here we use weekly anonymized and aggregated human
mobility data and spatially highly resolved data on COVID-19 cases, deaths and
hospitalizations at the municipality level in Mexico to investigate how
behavioural changes in response to the pandemic have altered the spatial scales
of transmission and interventions during its first wave (March - June 2020). We
find that the epidemic dynamics in Mexico were initially driven by SARS-CoV-2
exports from Mexico State and Mexico City, where early outbreaks occurred. The
mobility network shifted after the implementation of interventions in late
March 2020, and the mobility network communities became more disjointed while
epidemics in these communities became increasingly synchronised. Our results
provide actionable and dynamic insights into how to use network science and
epidemiological modelling to inform the spatial scale at which interventions
are most impactful in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and infectious diseases

spatial representations, or maps, of their environment. We ask if machines --
specifically, artificial intelligence (AI) navigation agents -- also build
implicit (or 'mental') maps. A positive answer to this question would (a)
explain the surprising phenomenon in recent literature of ostensibly map-free
neural-networks achieving strong performance, and (b) strengthen the evidence
of mapping as a fundamental mechanism for navigation by intelligent embodied
agents, whether they be biological or artificial. Unlike animal navigation, we
can judiciously design the agent's perceptual system and control the learning
paradigm to nullify alternative navigation mechanisms. Specifically, we train
'blind' agents -- with sensing limited to only egomotion and no other sensing
of any kind -- to perform PointGoal navigation ('go to $\Delta$ x, $\Delta$ y')
via reinforcement learning. Our agents are composed of navigation-agnostic
components (fully-connected and recurrent neural networks), and our
experimental setup provides no inductive bias towards mapping. Despite these
harsh conditions, we find that blind agents are (1) surprisingly effective
navigators in new environments (~95% success); (2) they utilize memory over
long horizons (remembering ~1,000 steps of past experience in an episode); (3)
this memory enables them to exhibit intelligent behavior (following walls,
detecting collisions, taking shortcuts); (4) there is emergence of maps and
collision detection neurons in the representations of the environment built by
a blind agent as it navigates; and (5) the emergent maps are selective and task
dependent (e.g. the agent 'forgets' exploratory detours). Overall, this paper
presents no new techniques for the AI audience, but a surprising finding, an
insight, and an explanation.

regression loss on data, it is generally challenging to scale the loss terms
for equations. This paper proposes a method for scaling the mean squared loss
terms in the objective function used to train PINNs. Instead of using automatic
differentiation to calculate the temporal derivative, we use backward Euler
discretization. This provides us with a scaling term for the equations. In this
work, we consider the two and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and
determine the kinematic viscosity using the spatio-temporal data on the
velocity and pressure fields. We first consider numerical datasets to test our
method. We test the sensitivity of our method to the time step size, the number
of timesteps, noise in the data, and spatial resolution. Finally, we use the
velocity field obtained using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments to
generate a reference pressure field. We then test our framework using the
velocity and reference pressure field.

early stages of the universe and, as the universe expands, it grows faster
compared to the standard cosmology. Besides, in the framework of GB gravity,
the growth of matter perturbations in higher dimensions is faster than
four-dimensions. Further, the growth of perturbations increases with increasing
the GB coupling parameter {\alpha}. This is an expected result, since the
higher order GB correction terms increase the strength of the gravity and thus
support the growth of perturbations. We also study the behavior of the density
abundance, the deceleration parameter and the jerk parameter of this model.
Finally, we investigate the effects of the GB parameter as well as the higher

Uniaxial stress-strain experimental data, combined with constitutive modeling

a nonlinear manifold learning problem. Our NN architecture inversely learns
non-trivial (e.g., non-additive and non-hierarchical) biases of the LF sources
in an interpretable and visualizable manifold where each data source is encoded

model form uncertainties such that LF sources with small bias are encoded close

reformulate the network's loss function based on strictly proper scoring rules

version of the open coloring axiom for $X$ that was introduced by
Todor\v{c}evi\'c and Feng to study definable sets of reals. We first show that
its recent infinite dimensional generalization by Carroy, Miller and Soukup
holds for all subsets of the Baire space in Solovay's model, extending a
theorem of Feng from dimension $2$. Our main theorem lifts this result to
generalized Baire spaces ${}^\kappa\kappa$ in two ways.
  (1) For any regular infinite cardinal $\kappa$, the following holds after a
L\'evy collapse of an inaccessible cardinal $\lambda>\kappa$ to $\kappa^+$.
Suppose that $H$ is a $\kappa$-dimensional box-open directed hypergraph on a
subset of ${}^\kappa\kappa$ such that $H$ is definable from a $\kappa$-sequence
of ordinals. Then either $H$ admits a coloring in $\kappa$ many colors or there
exists a continuous homomorphism from a canonical large directed hypergraph to
$H$.
  (2) If $\lambda$ is a Mahlo cardinal, then the previous extends to all
relatively box-open directed hypergraphs on any subset of ${}^\kappa\kappa$
that is definable from a $\kappa$-sequence of ordinals.
  We derive several applications to definable subsets of generalized Baire
spaces, among them variants of the Hurewicz dichotomy that characterizes
subsets of $K_\sigma$ sets, an asymmetric version of the Baire property, an
analogue of the Kechris-Louveau-Woodin dichotomy that characterizes when two
disjoint sets can be separated by an $F_\sigma$ set, the determinacy of
V\""a\""an\""anen's perfect set game for all subsets of ${}^\kappa\kappa$, and an

flagellar beating to swim, and it modulates the beating amplitudes
differentially to steer. This strategy hinges on both inherent flagellar
asymmetries (e.g. different response to chemical messengers) and such
asymmetries being effectively coordinated in the synchronous beating. In CR,
the synchrony of beating is known to be supported by a mechanical connection
between flagella, however, how flagellar asymmetries persist in the synchrony
remains elusive. For example, it has been speculated for decades that one
flagellum leads the beating, as its dynamic properties (i.e. frequency,
waveform, etc.) appear to be copied by the other one. In this study, we combine
experiments, computations, and modeling efforts to elucidate the roles played
by each flagellum in synchronous beating. With a non-invasive technique to
selectively load each flagellum, we show that the coordinated beating
essentially responds to only load exerted on the cis flagellum; and that such
asymmetry in response derives from a unilateral coupling between the two
flagella. Our results highlight a distinct role for each flagellum in
coordination and have implication for biflagellates tactic behaviors.

(ODI) method. This study adopts Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), a
probabilistic framework with an intrinsic de-noising mechanism to tackle
drawbacks of traditional Pressure Poisson solver and compares the performance
with ODI. To evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm, GPR and ODI are tested in
detail in a canonical setup of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence from the
Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database. According to the result, GPR has the same
level of accuracy as ODI with optimized hyper-parameters for the isotropic
turbulence flow. However, GPR has the tendency to flatten impulsive signals.
Therefore, without further modifications, it is not suitable to detect flow
structures with impulsive true signals. The error propagation of the proposed
framework is also analyzed and discussed in both physical and spectral spaces.

human-machine interfaces and bio-inspired robotics. Morphing into arbitrary
surfaces on demand requires a device with a sufficiently large number of
actuators and an inverse control strategy that can calculate the actuator
stimulation necessary to achieve a target surface. The programmability of a
morphing surface can be improved by increasing the number of independent
actuators, but this increases the complexity of the control system. Thus,
developing compact and efficient control interfaces and control algorithms is a
crucial knowledge gap for the adoption of morphing surfaces in broad
applications. In this work, we describe a passively addressed robotic morphing
surface (PARMS) composed of matrix-arranged ionic actuators. To reduce the
complexity of the physical control interface, we introduce passive matrix
addressing. Matrix addressing allows the control of independent actuators using
only 2N control inputs, which is significantly lower than control inputs
required for traditional direct addressing. Our control algorithm is based on
machine learning using finite element simulations as the training data. This
machine learning approach allows both forward and inverse control with high
precision in real time. Inverse control demonstrations show that the PARMS can
dynamically morph into arbitrary pre-defined surfaces on demand. These
innovations in actuator matrix control may enable future implementation of
PARMS in wearables, haptics, and augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR).

exponentially distributed replication and death times. Here we consider a
biologically more realistic model, in which organisms replicate
quasi-synchronously such that the distribution of replication times has a
narrow maximum at some $T>0$ corresponding to the mean doubling time. We show
that when the frequency of replication $f=1/T$ is tuned to the natural
oscillatory frequency of the predator-prey model, the system exhibits
oscillations that are much stronger than in the model with Poissonian
(non-synchronous) replication and death. The effect can be explained by
resonant amplification of coloured noise generated by quasi-synchronous
replication events. To show this, we consider a single-species model with
quasi-synchronous replication. We calculate the spectrum and the amplitude of
demographic noise in this model, and use these results to obtain these

substantial gains on many real-world debiasing benchmarks (11.4% relative gain

for regularized linear regression and show that in the high label noise regime,
the optimal value of $\xi$ that minimizes the expected error in estimating the

binary classification with random label corruption and quantify the range of
label corruption in which the student outperforms the teacher in terms of
accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind for the

the $\mathcal{O}(n/\log(k)+D)$ algorithm of Fraigniaud et al. achieves the

novel and simple algorithm that performs collaborative tree exploration in time
$2n/k+\mathcal{O}(D^2\log(k))$, thus outperforming Brass et al. for all values

Moreover, a recent result from Disser et al. implies that no exploration
algorithm can achieve a $2n/k+\mathcal{O}(D^{2-\epsilon})$ runtime guarantee.
The dependency in $D^2$ of our bound is in this sense optimal. The proof of our
result crucially relies on the analysis of an associated two-player game. We
extend the guarantees of BFDN to: scenarios with limited memory and

of classes of non-tree graphs. Finally, we provide a recursive version of BFDN

need to ensure safety in arbitrary environments while generating new motion
plans in real-time. In particular, one must ensure that a manipulator does not
collide with obstacles, collide with itself, or exceed its joint torque limits.
This challenge is compounded by the need to account for uncertainty in the mass
and inertia of manipulated objects, and potentially the robot itself. The
present work addresses this challenge by proposing Autonomous Robust
Manipulation via Optimization with Uncertainty-aware Reachability (ARMOUR), a
provably-safe, receding-horizon trajectory planner and tracking controller
framework for serial link manipulators. ARMOUR works by first constructing a
robust, passivity-based controller that is proven to enable a manipulator to
track desired trajectories with bounded error despite uncertain dynamics. Next,
ARMOUR uses a novel variation on the Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm (RNEA) to
compute the set of all possible inputs required to track any trajectory within
a continuum of desired trajectories. Finally, the method computes an
over-approximation to the swept volume of the manipulator; this enables one to
formulate an optimization problem, which can be solved in real-time, to
synthesize provably-safe motion. The proposed method is compared to state of
the art methods and demonstrated on a variety of challenging manipulation
examples in simulation and on real hardware, such as maneuvering a dumbbell
with uncertain mass around obstacles.

incorporating a demand-based data acquisition strategy. Simulation results show
that the developed signal model-based learning framework can significantly
reduce the actual interaction with the radio environment (i.e., the number of

been widely used to describe turbulent radiation signatures. Recent

stochastic patterns. Specifically, the variability time scale and average
polarization degree (PD) are governed by the correlation length of the
turbulence. Interestingly, magnetic turbulence can result in polarization angle
(PA) swings with arbitrary amplitudes and duration, in either directions, that
are not associated to changes in flux or PD. Surprisingly, these swings, which
are of stochastic nature, can appear either bumpy or smooth, although large

can be expressed as an easily computable mapping from inputs, in the form of
transactions on-chain, to outputs: allocations and payments. But proposers
decide which transactions to include, allowing them to manipulate these
mechanisms and extract temporary monopoly rents known as MEV. Motivated by both
general interest in running auctions on-chain, and current proposals to conduct
MEV auctions on-chain, we study how these manipulations effect the equilibria
of auctions.
  Formally, we consider an independent private value auction where bidders
simultaneously submit private bids, and public tips, that are paid to the
proposer upon inclusion. A single additional bidder may bribe the proposer to
omit competing bids.
  We show that even if bids are completely sealed, tips reveal bids in
equilibrium, which suggests that encrypting bids may not prevent manipulation.
Further, we show that collusion at the transaction inclusion step is extremely
profitable for the colluding bidder: as the number of bidders increases, the
probability that the winner is not colluding and the economic efficiency of the
auction both decrease faster than $1/n$. Running the auction over multiple
blocks, each with a different proposer, alleviates the problem only if the
number of blocks is larger than the number of bidders. We argue that
blockchains with more than one concurrent proposer can credibly execute
auctions on chain, as long as tips can be conditioned on the number of
proposers that include the transaction.

ionized species of gas with ionization potentials $\ge$ 100 eV. These CLs may
serve as excellent signatures for the strong ionizing continuum of AGN. To
determine if CLs are in fact strong AGN tracers, we assemble and analyze the
largest catalog of optical CL galaxies using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's
Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) catalog. We detect
CL emission in 71 MaNGA galaxies, out of the 10,010 unique galaxies from the
final MaNGA catalog, with $\ge$ 5$\sigma$ confidence. In our sample, we measure
[NeV]$\lambda$3347, $\lambda$3427, [FeVII]$\lambda$3586, $\lambda$3760,
$\lambda$6086, and [FeX]$\lambda$6374 emission and crossmatch the CL galaxies

emission, is best at identifying high luminosity AGN. Moreover, we find that
the CL galaxies with the least dust extinction yield the most iron CL
detections. We posit that the bulk of the iron CLs are destroyed by dust grains
in the galaxies with the highest [OIII] luminosities in our sample, and that
AGN in the galaxies with low [OIII] luminosities are possibly too weak to be

are played on two sets of structures, while EF games are played on a pair of

structures. In the first part of this paper, we perform a finer analysis of MS

we point out that the use of sets of structures is of the essence and that when
MS games are played on pairs of structures, they capture Boolean combinations

focus on another important difference between MS games and EF games, namely,
the necessity for Spoiler to play on top of a previous move in order to win

delineate the expressive power of the variant of MS games in which Spoiler
never plays on top of a previous move. In the second part we focus on

quantization, mixed precision quantization methods selectively tune the
precision of individual layers of a network to achieve a minimum drop in task
performance (e.g., accuracy). To estimate the impact of layer precision choice
on task performance two methods are introduced: i) Entropy Approximation Guided
Layer selection (EAGL) is fast and uses the entropy of the weight distribution,
and ii) Accuracy-aware Layer Precision Selection (ALPS) is straightforward and
relies on single epoch fine-tuning after layer precision reduction. Using EAGL

the image and further enhance visual features. Then, considering that
relationships between objects are influenced by depth, depth-aware Transformer
is proposed to do attention mechanism guided by depth differences from answer
words and objects to objects, where each word is tagged with pseudo depth value
according to related objects. To better optimize parameters of the framework, a
model parameter estimation method is further proposed to weightedly integrate

for UDA by distilling category-relevant features and excluding
category-irrelevant features from the global feature maps. This disentanglement
prevents the network from overfitting to category-irrelevant information and
makes it focus on information useful for classification. This reduces the
difficulty of domain alignment and improves the classification accuracy on the

Domain Adaptation via Feature Disentanglement~(DAFD), which has two components:
(1)the Category-Relevant Feature Selection (CRFS) module, which disentangles
the category-relevant features from the category-irrelevant features, and
(2)the Dynamic Local Maximum Mean Discrepancy (DLMMD) module, which achieves
fine-grained alignment by reducing the discrepancy within the category-relevant
features from different domains. Combined with the CRFS, the DLMMD module can
align the category-relevant features properly. We conduct comprehensive

contrastive learning (CL) on diverse data types, including graph contrastive
learning (GCL). Existing hardness-aware CL methods typically treat negative
instances that are most similar to the anchor instance as hard negatives, which
helps improve the CL performance, especially on image data. However, this
approach often fails to identify the hard negatives but leads to many false
negatives on graph data. This is mainly due to that the learned graph
representations are not sufficiently discriminative due to over-smooth
representations and/or non-i.i.d. issues in graph data. To tackle this problem,
this paper proposes a novel approach that builds a discriminative model on
collective affinity information (i.e, two sets of pairwise affinities between
the negative instances and the anchor instance) to mine hard negatives in GCL.
In particular, the proposed approach evaluates how confident/uncertain the
discriminative model is about the affinity of each negative instance to an
anchor instance to determine its hardness weight relative to the anchor
instance. This uncertainty information is then incorporated into existing GCL
loss functions via a weighting term to enhance their performance. The enhanced
GCL is theoretically grounded that the resulting GCL loss is equivalent to a
triplet loss with an adaptive margin being exponentially proportional to the
learned uncertainty of each negative instance. Extensive experiments on 10
graph datasets show that our approach i) consistently enhances different
state-of-the-art GCL methods in both graph and node classification tasks, and
ii) significantly improves their robustness against adversarial attacks.

In particular, exciton-enhanced magneto-optical properties revealed in CrI$_3$
and CrBr$_3$ monolayers have expanded the understanding of exciton physics in
2D materials. Unlike CrI$_3$ and CrBr$_3$ with out-of-plane magnetization,
CrSBr has an in-plane magnetic moment, therefore, providing a good opportunity
to study the magnetic linear dichroism and high order magneto-optical effects.
Here, based on many-body perturbation method within density-functional theory,
we have studied quasiparticle electronic structure, exciton, and optical
properties in CrSBr monolayer. Strongly bounded exciton has been identified
with the first bright exciton located at 1.35 eV, in good agreement with
experiment of photoluminescence (Nat. Mater. 20, 1657 (2021)). Strong contrast
in the optical absorption is found between the electric fields lying along the
in-plane two orthogonal directions. In accordance to typical and realistic
experimental setup, we show that the rotation angle of linear polarized light,
either reflected or transmitted, could be comparable with those revealed in
black phosphorene. Such a large linear dichroism arises mainly from anisotropic
in-plane crystal structure. The magnetic contribution from the off-diagonal

Previous works model the Alfven wave fluctuation as the perturbation along a

suggested that the decomposition of Alfven wave along a straight line, aka. the

Alfven wave in the global frame of reference, some of the Alfven wave will be

  This paper achieves a new type of these adaptive regret bounds via a sparse

and its sparsity on a user-specified dictionary, which offers considerable
versatility. Equipped with a wavelet dictionary for example, our framework
improves the state-of-the-art bound (Jacobsen & Cutkosky, 2022) by adapting to

excellent accuracy properties, tailored to a novel solver approach based on
algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods designed for advective operators. We pose the
problem in a mixed formulation, introducing the heat flux as an auxiliary

reordered and solved using an approach in which two advection operators are
inverted using AMG solvers based on approximate ideal restriction (AIR), which
is particularly efficient for upwind discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of

Leading methods based on normalizing flows have tried to solve this problem
with an invertible transformation instead of a deterministic mapping. However,
the implicit bijective mapping is not explored well. Inspired by a latent
observation that noise tends to appear in the high-frequency part of the image,
we propose a fully invertible denoising method that injects the idea of
disentangled learning into a general invertible neural network to split noise
from the high-frequency part. More specifically, we decompose the noisy image
into clean low-frequency and hybrid high-frequency parts with an invertible
transformation and then disentangle case-specific noise and high-frequency
components in the latent space. In this way, denoising is made tractable by
inversely merging noiseless low and high-frequency parts. Furthermore, we
construct a flexible hierarchical disentangling framework, which aims to
decompose most of the low-frequency image information while disentangling noise
from the high-frequency part in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments
on real image denoising, JPEG compressed artifact removal, and medical low-dose
CT image restoration have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves
competing performance on both quantitative metrics and visual quality, with
significantly less computational cost.

intelligent transportation systems. With the rapid development of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs), road scene analysis can usually achieve satisfactory
results in the source domain. However, guaranteeing good generalization to
different target domain scenarios remains a significant challenge. Recently,
semi-supervised learning and active learning have been proposed to alleviate
this problem. Semisupervised learning can improve model accuracy with massive
unlabeled data, but some pseudo labels containing noise would be generated with
limited or imbalanced training data. And there will be suboptimal models if
human guidance is absent. Active learning can select more effective data to
intervene, while the model accuracy can not be improved because the massive
unlabeled data are not used. And the probability of querying sub-optimal
samples will increase when the domain difference is too large, increasing
annotation cost. This paper proposes an iterative loop method combining active
and semisupervised learning for domain adaptive semantic segmentation. The
method first uses semi-supervised to learn massive unlabeled data to improve
model accuracy and provide more accurate selection models for active learning.
Secondly, combined with the predictive uncertainty sample selection strategy of
active learning, manual intervention is used to correct the pseudo-labels.
Finally, flexible iterative loops achieve the best performance with minimal
labeling cost. Extensive experiments show that our method establishes
state-of-the-art performance on tasks of GTAV to Cityscapes, SYNTHIA to
Cityscapes, improving by 4.9% mIoU and 5.2% mIoU, compared to the previous best

novel SBRS framework named COCO-SBRS (COunterfactual COllaborative

user-item interactions in SBRSs. COCO-SBRS first adopts a self-supervised
approach to pre-train a recommendation model by designing pseudo-labels of

process. Next, COCO-SBRS adopts counterfactual inference to recommend items
based on the outputs of the pre-trained recommendation model considering the
causalities to alleviate the data sparsity problem. As a result, COCO-SBRS can
learn the causalities in data, preventing the model from learning spurious

we train a baseline model using an end-to-end transformer to predict ratings
directly from the raw dialogue text. The other three methods are variants of a
two-stage approach in which we first extract interpretable features at the turn
level that capture, among other aspects, user dialogue behaviors indicating
contradiction, repetition, disinterest, compliments, or criticism. We project
these features to the dialogue level and train a dialogue-level MLP regression
model, a dialogue-level LSTM, and a novel causal inference model called
counterfactual-LSTM (CF-LSTM) to predict ratings. The proposed CF-LSTM is a
sequential model over turn-level features which predicts ratings using multiple
regressors depending on hypotheses derived from the turn-level features. As a
causal inference model, CF-LSTM aims to learn the underlying causes of a
specific event, such as a low rating. We also bin the user ratings and perform

$\mathbf{k}$, the cofixed space is the largest quotient of the representation
on which the group acts trivially. If $G$ acts by $\mathbf{k}$-algebra
automorphisms, then the cofixed space is a module over the ring of
$G$-invariants. When the order of $G$ is not invertible in the base ring,
little is known about this module structure. We study the cofixed space in the
case that $G$ is the symmetric group on $n$ letters acting on a polynomial ring
by permuting its variables. When $\mathbf{k}$ has characteristic 0, the cofixed
space is isomorphic to an ideal of the ring of symmetric polynomials.
Localizing $\mathbf{k}$ at a prime integer $p$ while letting $n$ vary reveals
striking behavior in these ideals. As $n$ grows, the ideals stay stable in a
sense, then jump in complexity each time $n$ reaches a multiple of $p$.

rely on the pseudo-labels generated by source models that can be noisy due to
domain shift. In this paper, we study SFDA from the perspective of learning
with label noise (LLN). Unlike the label noise in the conventional LLN
scenario, we prove that the label noise in SFDA follows a different

LLN methods that rely on their distribution assumptions unable to address the
label noise in SFDA. Empirical evidence suggests that only marginal
improvements are achieved when applying the existing LLN methods to solve the
SFDA problem. On the other hand, although there exists a fundamental difference
between the label noise in the two scenarios, we demonstrate theoretically that
the early-time training phenomenon (ETP), which has been previously observed in
conventional label noise settings, can also be observed in the SFDA problem.
Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements to existing SFDA

generation tasks, where researchers usually choose different encoding methods
depending on specific goals. However, the advantages and drawbacks of different
encoding methods have not been frequently discussed. This paper presents a
integrated analysis of the influence of two low-level feature, pitch and meter,
on the performance of a token-based sequential music generation model. First,
the commonly used MIDI number encoding and a less used class-octave encoding
are compared. Second, an dense intra-bar metric grid is imposed to the encoded
sequence as auxiliary features. Different complexity and resolutions of the
metric grid are compared. For complexity, the single token approach and the
multiple token approach are compared; for grid resolution, 0 (ablation), 1
(bar-level), 4 (downbeat-level) 12, (8th-triplet-level) up to 64
(64th-note-grid-level) are compared; for duration resolution, 4, 8, 12 and 16
subdivisions per beat are compared. All different encodings are tested on
separately trained Transformer-XL models for a melody generation task.
Regarding distribution similarity of several objective evaluation metrics to
the test dataset, results suggest that the class-octave encoding significantly
outperforms the taken-for-granted MIDI encoding on pitch-related metrics; finer
grids and multiple-token grids improve the rhythmic quality, but also suffer
from over-fitting at early training stage. Results display a general phenomenon
of over-fitting from two aspects, the pitch embedding space and the test loss
of the single-token grid encoding. From a practical perspective, we both
demonstrate the feasibility and raise the concern of easy over-fitting problem
of using smaller networks and lower embedding dimensions on the generation

detector. Three prototypes (GBCR1, GBCR2, and GBCR3) have been designed in the
CERN-identified 65 nm CMOS technology. GBCR receives seven (GBCR2) or six
(GBCR3) channels (RX) each at 1.28 Gbps from the front-end readout chip RD53B
via flex cables up to 1 meter and Twinax cables up to 5 meters and sends the
equalized and retimed signals to lpGBT. Both GBCR2 and GBCR3 ASICs have two
transmitting channels (TX) that pre-emphasize the signals from lpGBT before
sending them to RD53B through the same cables. No Single-Event Upset (SEU) is
observed in any tested channels of GBCR2 in a 400 MeV proton beam. The
extrapolated bit error rate for the future HL-LHC application is below
8*10^(-16), significantly below the specified BER criterion. GBCR3 is designed
to improve the immunity to single-event-upset by applying the Triple Modular
Redundancy (TMR) technology to all RX channels. The retimed signals from GBCR3
have less total jitter than those from GBCR2 (35 ps versus 79 ps). Each
receiver channel of GBCR3 consumes 75% more power than that of GBCR2.

Crocker","The emergence of soft-glassy mechanics in simulated foams",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Several seemingly different soft materials, including foams, cells, and many
complex fluids, exhibit remarkably similar rheological properties and
microscopic dynamics, termed soft glassy mechanics. Here, we show that such
behavior emerges from a simple model of a damped ripening foam, for
sufficiently weak damping. In particular, we observe intermittent avalanchey
dynamics, bubble super-diffusion, and power-law rheology that vary as the
damping factor is changed. In the limit of weak damping, the dynamics are
determined by the tortuous low-lying portions of the energy landscape, as
described in a recent study. For strong damping the viscous stresses cause the
system configuration to evolve along higher energy paths, washing out
small-scale tortuosity and producing motion with an increasingly ballistic
character. Using a microrheological approach, the linear viscoelastic response
of the model can be efficiently calculated. This resembles the power-law
rheology expected for soft glassy mechanics, but unexpectedly, is only weakly
sensitive to the damping parameter. Lastly, we study the reported memory effect
in foams after large perturbations and find that the timescale of the memory
goes to zero as the damping parameter vanishes, suggesting that the effect is
due to viscous stress relaxation rather than slow structural changes stabilized
by the energy landscape.

flexible and plausible editing of generated images by manipulating the

editability. Existing encoder-based or optimization-based StyleGAN inversion
methods attempt to mitigate the trade-off but see limited performance. To
fundamentally resolve this problem, we propose a novel two-phase framework by
designating two separate networks to tackle editing and reconstruction
respectively, instead of balancing the two. Specifically, in Phase I, a
W-space-oriented StyleGAN inversion network is trained and used to perform
image inversion and editing, which assures the editability but sacrifices
reconstruction quality. In Phase II, a carefully designed rectifying network is
utilized to rectify the inversion errors and perform ideal reconstruction.
Experimental results show that our approach yields near-perfect reconstructions
without sacrificing the editability, thus allowing accurate manipulation of
real images. Further, we evaluate the performance of our rectifying network,
and see great generalizability towards unseen manipulation types and

formulate a novel method to calculate the radiative corrections to $\bar\theta$

that two-loop level radiative $\bar\theta$ completely vanishes (corresponding
to one-loop corrections to the quark mass matrices). Furthermore, we estimate
the size of a non-vanishing radiative $\bar\theta$ at three-loop level. It is
found that the resultant induced neutron EDM is comparable to the current

range of values determining the copula is not the entire unit square and this

using automated bidding for optimizing their advertising campaigns. Such
advertisers have an optimization goal (e.g. to maximize conversions), and some
constraints (e.g. a budget or an upper bound on average cost per conversion),
and the automated bidding system optimizes their auction bids on their behalf.
Often, these advertisers participate on multiple advertising channels and try
to optimize across these channels. A central question that remains unexplored
is how automated bidding affects optimal auction design in the multi-channel
setting.
  In this paper, we study the problem of setting auction reserve prices in the
multi-channel setting. In particular, we shed light on the revenue implications
of whether each channel optimizes its reserve price locally, or whether the
channels optimize them globally to maximize total revenue. Motivated by
practice, we consider two models: one in which the channels have full freedom
to set reserve prices, and another in which the channels have to respect floor
prices set by the publisher. We show that in the first model, welfare and
revenue loss from local optimization is bounded by a function of the
advertisers' inputs, but is independent of the number of channels and bidders.
In stark contrast, we show that the revenue from local optimization could be
arbitrarily smaller than those from global optimization in the second model.

more robust to the variance of support examples. Besides, we decouple
classification and regression tasks so that VFA is performed on the

feature enables advertisers to simply provide high-level constraints and goals
to an automated agent, which optimizes their auction bids on their behalf. In
this paper, we examine the effect of different auctions on the incentives of
advertisers to report their constraints to the auto-bidder intermediaries. More
precisely, we study whether canonical auctions such as first price auction
(FPA) and second price auction (SPA) are auto-bidding incentive compatible
(AIC): whether an advertiser can gain by misreporting their constraints to the
autobidder.
  We consider value-maximizing advertisers in two important settings: when they
have a budget constraint and when they have a target cost-per-acquisition
constraint. The main result of our work is that for both settings, FPA and SPA
are not AIC. This contrasts with FPA being AIC when auto-bidders are
constrained to bid using a (sub-optimal) uniform bidding policy. We further
extend our main result and show that any (possibly randomized) auction that is
truthful (in the classic profit-maximizing sense), scalar invariant and
symmetric is not AIC. Finally, to complement our findings, we provide
sufficient market conditions for FPA and SPA to become AIC for two advertisers.
These conditions require advertisers' valuations to be well-aligned. This
suggests that when the competition is intense for all queries, advertisers have
less incentive to misreport their constraints.
  From a methodological standpoint, we develop a novel continuous model of
queries. This model provides tractability to study equilibrium with
auto-bidders, which contrasts with the standard discrete query model, which is
known to be hard. Through the analysis of this model, we uncover a surprising
result: in auto-bidding with two advertisers, FPA and SPA are auction

defeats result in significant structure inconsistency between the depth map and

thereby degrades the DSR quality. In this paper, we propose a novel structure
flow-guided DSR framework, where a cross-modality flow map is learned to guide

Specifically, our framework consists of a cross-modality flow-guided upsampling

CFUNet contains a trilateral self-attention module combining both the geometric

this paper, we propose a middle-ground solution for the dilemma, which is to
formulate the training as a weakly- and semi-supervised learning problem that
we refer to as malignant breast lesion detection with incomplete annotations.
To address this problem, our new method comprises two stages, namely: 1)
pre-training a multi-view mammogram classifier with weak supervision from the
whole dataset, and 2) extending the trained classifier to become a multi-view
detector that is trained with semi-supervised student-teacher learning, where
the training set contains fully and weakly-annotated mammograms. We provide
extensive detection results on two real-world screening mammogram datasets
containing incomplete annotations, and show that our proposed approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in the detection of malignant breast lesions with
incomplete annotations.

Generally, most existing methods employ hand-crafted operators to decompose the
high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) ingredients from low-resolution
depth maps and guide the HF ingredients by directly concatenating them with
image features. However, the hand-designed operators usually cause inferior HF
maps (e.g., distorted or structurally missing) due to the diverse appearance of
complex depth maps. Moreover, the direct concatenation often results in weak
guidance because not all image features have a positive effect on the HF maps.
In this paper, we develop a recurrent structure attention guided (RSAG)
framework, consisting of two important parts. First, we introduce a deep
contrastive network with multi-scale filters for adaptive frequency-domain
separation, which adopts contrastive networks from large filters to small ones
to calculate the pixel contrasts for adaptive high-quality HF predictions.
Second, instead of the coarse concatenation guidance, we propose a recurrent
structure attention block, which iteratively utilizes the latest depth
estimation and the image features to jointly select clear patterns and
boundaries, aiming at providing refined guidance for accurate depth recovery.
In addition, we fuse the features of HF maps to enhance the edge structures in
the decomposed LF maps. Extensive experiments show that our approach obtains
superior performance compared with state-of-the-art depth super-resolution
methods.

is aimed at segmenting anomaly patterns of the earth deviating from normal

However, it is a challenging task due to the complex distribution and the
irregular shapes of objects, and the lack of abnormal samples. To tackle these
problems, an anomaly segmentation model based on pixel descriptors (ASD) is
proposed for anomaly segmentation in HSR imagery. Specifically, deep one-class
classification is introduced for anomaly segmentation in the feature space with
discriminative pixel descriptors. The ASD model incorporates the data argument
for generating virtual ab-normal samples, which can force the pixel descriptors
to be compact for normal data and meanwhile to be diverse to avoid the model
collapse problems when only positive samples participated in the training. In
addition, the ASD introduced a multi-level and multi-scale feature extraction
strategy for learning the low-level and semantic information to make the pixel
descriptors feature-rich. The proposed ASD model was validated using four HSR
datasets and compared with the recent state-of-the-art models, showing its
potential value in Earth vision applications.

optimization problems we refer to as $\textit{saddle problems}$, which include
the partial supremum or infimum of convex-concave saddle functions. Saddle
problems arise in a wide range of applications, including game theory, machine
learning, and finance. It is well known that a saddle problem can be reduced to
a single convex optimization problem by dualizing either the convex (min) or
concave (max) objectives, reducing a min-max problem into a min-min (or
max-max) problem. Carrying out this conversion by hand can be tedious and error
prone. In this paper we introduce $\textit{disciplined saddle programming}$
(DSP), a domain specific language (DSL) for specifying saddle problems, for
which the dualizing trick can be automated. The language and methods are based
on recent work by Juditsky and Nemirovski arXiv:2102.01002 [math.OC], who
developed the idea of conic-representable saddle point programs, and showed how
to carry out the required dualization automatically using conic duality.
Juditsky and Nemirovski's conic representation of saddle problems extends

larger than those of two-body hadronic radiative decays $W^\pm\to M^\pm \gamma$

$W$ decays into a neutral vector meson plus lepton pair may be the promising
channels in future experimental facilities with a large number of $W$-boson

machine learning, which ensures equal treatment of different demographic
groups. Numerous works aim to achieve demographic parity by pursuing the
commonly used metric $\Delta DP$. Unfortunately, in this paper, we reveal that
the fairness metric $\Delta DP$ can not precisely measure the violation of
demographic parity, because it inherently has the following drawbacks: i)
zero-value $\Delta DP$ does not guarantee zero violation of demographic parity,
ii) $\Delta DP$ values can vary with different classification thresholds. To
this end, we propose two new fairness metrics, Area Between Probability density
function Curves (ABPC) and Area Between Cumulative density function Curves
(ABCC), to precisely measure the violation of demographic parity at the
distribution level. The new fairness metrics directly measure the difference
between the distributions of the prediction probability for different
demographic groups. Thus our proposed new metrics enjoy: i) zero-value
ABCC/ABPC guarantees zero violation of demographic parity; ii) ABCC/ABPC
guarantees demographic parity while the classification thresholds are adjusted.
We further re-evaluate the existing fair models with our proposed fairness
metrics and observe different fairness behaviors of those models under the new

performing label distribution learning (LDL) would enhance the model
calibration in CNN training. To verify this assumption, we used a simple LDL

significantly impede model calibration. 2) Training using LDL with recent data
augmentation can have excellent effects on model calibration and even in
generalization performance. 3) Online LDL brings additional improvements in
model calibration and accuracy with long training, especially in large-size

to learn robotic tasks. But mainly, all such methods focus on a single task or
multi-task learning, which requires retraining every time we need to learn a
new task. Continuously learning tasks without forgetting previous knowledge
combined with the power of offline deep-RL would allow us to scale the number
of tasks by keep adding them one-after-another. In this paper, we investigate
the effectiveness of regularisation-based methods like synaptic intelligence
for sequentially learning image-based robotic manipulation tasks in an

against common challenges of sequential learning: catastrophic forgetting and
forward knowledge transfer. We performed experiments with different task
combinations to analyze the effect of task ordering. We also investigated the
effect of the number of object configurations and density of robot
trajectories. We found that learning tasks sequentially helps in the
propagation of knowledge from previous tasks, thereby reducing the time
required to learn a new task. Regularisation based approaches for continuous
learning like the synaptic intelligence method although helps in mitigating
catastrophic forgetting but has shown only limited transfer of knowledge from
previous tasks.

validating climate models under varying climatic conditions. However, many
models are run without explicitly simulating water isotopologues. We
investigate the possibility to replace the explicit physics-based simulation of
oxygen isotopic composition in precipitation using machine learning methods.
These methods estimate isotopic composition at each time step for given fields
of surface temperature and precipitation amount. We implement convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) based on the successful UNet architecture and test
whether a spherical network architecture outperforms the naive approach of
treating Earth's latitude-longitude grid as a flat image. Conducting a case
study on a last millennium run with the iHadCM3 climate model, we find that
roughly 40\% of the temporal variance in the isotopic composition is explained
by the emulations on interannual and monthly timescale, with spatially varying
emulation quality. A modified version of the standard UNet architecture for
flat images yields results that are equally good as the predictions by the
spherical CNN. We test generalization to last millennium runs of other climate
models and find that while the tested deep learning methods yield the best
results on iHadCM3 data, the performance drops when predicting on other models
and is comparable to simple pixel-wise linear regression. An extended choice of
predictor variables and improving the robustness of learned climate--oxygen
isotope relationships should be explored in future work.

generating precision assignments that (i) use less memory and (ii) lead to more

perfect liquid observation to a ``perfect QCD'' guiding principle is presented,
focusing on implications for particle production in small systems. The first
steps towards a microscopic model is taken by arguing that ``perfect QCD''
suggests that the screening in the initial state is so large that multi-parton
interactions are of little or no importance. Instead, a target and projectile
remnant is coherently excited and particle production is mainly driven by
radiation in a qualitative similar manner as $e^+e^- \rightarrow q\bar{q}$.
Finally, some of the possible implications of this ``excited remnant model''
are presented. It is argued that the time ordering of soft and hard physics can
explain the absence of jet quenching in small systems and that the coherence
scale of the projectile and target provides insights into what small systems
will exhibit flow.

dispersions, a relatively strong magnetic field, and a strong tidal field all
contribute to inhibiting star formation (SF) in different ways in different CMZ
locations. Nonetheless, there are spectacular displays of recent and ongoing SF
in the CMZ, including massive young stellar clusters, sites of abundant SF in
progress, and numerous spots of protostellar or YSO activity. The presence of
giant molecular clouds in the CMZ that are almost entirely devoid of SF
indicates that SF requires a trigger that is not present everywhere. The
dominant provocation of SF is likely to be cloud compression, either by
large-scale shocks or by orbital motion of clouds into a region of enhanced
tidal compression and/or enhanced external pressure. Recent hypotheses for
where and how SF takes place in the CMZ are constrained by the recent orbital
determinations of the massive Arches and Quintuplet clusters. Star formation in

Recently, deep learning (DL) has been introduced to enhance CSI feedback in
massive MIMO application, where the massive collected training data and lengthy
training time are costly and impractical for realistic deployment. In this
paper, a knowledge-driven meta-learning solution for CSI feedback is proposed,
where the DL model initialized by the meta model obtained from meta training
phase is able to achieve rapid convergence when facing a new scenario during
the target retraining phase. Specifically, instead of training with massive
data collected from various scenarios, the meta task environment is constructed
based on the intrinsic knowledge of spatial-frequency characteristics of CSI
for meta training. Moreover, the target task dataset is also augmented by
exploiting the knowledge of statistical characteristics of channel, so that the
DL model initialized by meta training can rapidly fit into a new target
scenario with higher performance using only a few actually collected data in
the target retraining phase. The method greatly reduces the demand for the
number of actual collected data, as well as the cost of training time for
realistic deployment. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the

early-stopping strategies on gradient-descent (GD) methods for linear

However, we show that this strategy can be arbitrarily sub-optimal in the case

findings in the case of classification~\cite{Vardi2022GradientMP} that show
that GD provably converges to non-robust models. To alleviate this issue, we
propose to apply instead a GD scheme on a transformation of the data adapted to
the attack. This data transformation amounts to apply feature-depending
learning rates and we show that this modified GD is able to handle any
Mahalanobis attack, as well as more general attacks under some conditions.
Unfortunately, choosing such adapted transformations can be hard for general

to Jupiter and Saturn that migrate outwards while maintaining an orbital
resonance can produce distinctive features in the dust distribution. Dust
accumulates at the outer edge of the common gas gap, which behaves as a dust
trap, where the local dust concentration is significantly enhanced by the
planets outward motion. Concurrently, an expanding cavity forms in the dust
distribution inside the planets orbits, because dust does not filter through
the common gaseous gap and grain depletion in the region continues via inward
drifting. There is no cavity in the gas distribution because gas can filter
through the gap, although ongoing gas accretion on the planets can reduce the
gas density in the inner disc. Such behaviour was demonstrated by means of
simulations neglecting the effects of dust diffusion due to turbulence and of
dust backreaction on the gas. Both effects may alter the formation of the dust
peak at the gap outer edge and of the inner dust cavity, by letting grains
filter through the dust trap. We performed high resolution hydrodynamical
simulations of the coupled evolution of gas and dust species, the latter
treated as pressureless fluids, in the presence of two giant planets. We show
that diffusion and backreaction can change some morphological aspects of the
dust distribution but do not alter some main features, such as the outer peak
and the expanding inner cavity. These findings are confirmed for different
parametrizations of gas viscosity.

polarizability model (BPM) and a ML-based atomic polarizability model (AlphaML)
in predicting polarizability of alkanes and then also investigated the ability
of simulating Raman spectra. We found that the AlphaML has appreciable
advantages over the BPM in learning the polarizability in the training data set
and predicting polarizability of molecules that configurational differently
from training structures. In addition, the BPM has inherent disadvantages in
predicting polarizability anisotropy due to many factors including large
uncertainties of estimating bond anisotropy, omitting of off-diagonal
parameters in the construction of the model. As a result, the BPM has larger
errors than the AlphaML in the simulation of anisotropic Raman scattering.
Finally, we demonstrated that both the BPM and AlphaML suffer from transference
to alkanes larger than those used in the training data sets, but the problem
for the AlphaML can be circumvented by exploring more proper training
structures.

difficult to identify risks accurately and timely. To address the challenges,
we redefine the problem as \textbf{company financial risk assessment on

tribe and leveraging financial news to build inter-tribe connections. Such
tribe-style graphs present different patterns to distinguish risky companies
from normal ones. However, most nodes in the tribe-style graph lack attributes,
making it difficult to directly adopt existing graph learning methods (e.g.,
Graph Neural Networks(GNNs)). In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical
Graph Neural Network (TH-GNN) for Tribe-style graphs via two levels, with the
first level to encode the structure pattern of the tribes with contrastive

relations, achieving effective and efficient risk assessment. Extensive
experiments on the real-world company dataset show that our method achieves
significant improvements on financial risk assessment over previous competing

widely known as the long-range correlation (LRC) of order flow; specifically,
the sign correlation function displays long memory with power-law exponent
$\gamma$, such that $C(\tau) \propto \tau^{-\gamma}$ for large time-lag $\tau$.
One of the most promising microscopic hypotheses is the order-splitting
behaviour at the level of individual traders. Indeed, Lillo, Mike, and Farmer
(LMF) introduced in 2005 a simple microscopic model of order-splitting
behaviour, which predicts that the macroscopic sign correlation is
quantitatively associated with the microscopic distribution of metaorders.
While this hypothesis has been a central issue of debate in econophysics, its
direct quantitative validation has been missing because it requires large
microscopic datasets with high resolution to observe the order-splitting
behaviour of all individual traders. Here we present the first quantitative
validation of this LFM prediction by analysing a large microscopic dataset in
the Tokyo Stock Exchange market for more than nine years. On classifying all
traders as either order-splitting traders or random traders as a statistical
clustering, we directly measured the metaorder-length distributions
$P(L)\propto L^{-\alpha-1}$ as the microscopic parameter of the LMF model and
examined the theoretical prediction on the macroscopic order correlation:
$\gamma \approx \alpha - 1$. We discover that the LMF prediction agrees with
the actual data even at the quantitative level. Our work provides the first
solid support of the microscopic model and solves directly a long-standing

optical path deviates from the original design, the corresponding PSF is often
hard to calculate, as the phase and amplitude modifications need to be modelled
in detail. Accurate PSF models need to account for the vector nature of the
electric fields in particular for high numerical apertures. Compared to the
computation of a commonly used scalar PSF model, the vectorial model is
computationally more expensive, yet more accurate. State-of-the-art scalar and
vector PSF models exist, but they all have their pros and cons. Many
real-space-based models fall into the sampling pitfall near the centre of the
image, yielding integrated plane intensities which are not constant near the
nominal focus position, violating energy conservation. This and other problems
which typically arise when calculating PSFs are discussed and their shortfalls
are quantitatively compared. A highly oversampled Richards and Wolf model is
chosen as the gold standard for our quantitative comparison due its ability to
represent the ideal field accurately, albeit being practically very slow in the
calculation. Fourier-based methods are shown to be computationally very

glass-like structure. As the amount or quality of observed data improves, this
recurrence graph undergoes a percolation transition manifesting as weak
ergodicity breaking for random walks on the induced landscape -- revealing the
shared driver's dynamics, even in the presence of strongly corrupted or noisy

quantify the dependence of reconstruction accuracy on the rate of information
transfer from a chaotic driver to the response systems, and we find that

We first derive the exact Dyson-Schwinger integral equation of the full

propagators and fermion-boson vertex functions, and thus seems to be
intractable. To solve this difficulty, we further derive a number of identities

propagator is actually self-closed. This self-closed equation takes into
account not only all the vertex corrections, but also the mutual influence
between electron-phonon interaction and Coulomb interaction. Solving it by
using proper numerical methods leads to the superconducting temperature $T_{c}$
and other quantities. As an application of the approach, we compute the $T_{c}$
of the interfacial superconductivity realized in the one-unit-cell
FeSe/SrTiO$_{3}$ system. We find that $T_{c}$ can be strongly influenced by the
vertex corrections and the competition between phonon-mediated attraction and
Coulomb repulsion.

The key implication of this discovery and our analyses is that V994 Her is the

binaries eclipse. In this work, we use a combination of ground-based
observations and $TESS$ data to analyze the eclipses of binaries A and B in
order to update the parameters of the inner quadruple's orbit (with a derived
period of 1062 $\pm$ 2d). The eclipses of binary C that were detected in the
$TESS$ data were also found in older ground-based observations, as well as in
more recently obtained observations. The eclipse timing variations of all three
pairs were studied in order to detect the mutual perturbations of their
constituent stars, as well as those of the inner pairs in the (2+2) core. At
the longest periods they arise from apsidal motion, which may help constraining
parameters of the component stars' internal structure. We also discuss the
relative proximity of the periods of binaries A and B to a 3:2 mean motion
resonance. This work represents a step forward in the development of techniques
to better understand and characterize multiple star systems, especially those
with multiple eclipsing components.

various researchers have dedicated their works to identifying potential

visual impairments influencing QoE are stalling events and quality switches. So
far, it is commonly assumed that those stalling events have the worst impact on
QoE. This paper challenged this belief and reviewed this assumption by
comparing stalling events with multiple quality and high amplitude quality
switches. Two subjective studies were conducted. During the first subjective
study, participants received a monetary incentive, while the second subjective
study was carried out with volunteers. The statistical analysis demonstrated
that stalling events do not result in the worst degradation of QoE. These

The total HI mass of the complex is $2\times10^{7}\text{ M}_\odot$ or 0.6% of
the total HI mass of the galaxy. The main structure, previously referred to as
the 8-kpc filament, is now seen to be even more extended, along a 20 kpc

unlikely to be the result of outflows related to galactic fountains. It is more
likely that the 20 kpc filament is related to a recent galaxy interaction. In
this context, a $\sim$ 50 kpc long stellar stream has been recently detected
connecting NGC 2403 with the nearby dwarf satellite DDO 44. Intriguingly, the

the massive interindividual variations in the morphology and spatial

variations are considered as noise and the matching of folds is only implicit.
Alternative approaches are based on the extraction and explicit identification

graph-matching problem. In this paper, we propose to address the problem of
sulcal graph matching directly at the population level using multi-graph

  Sparsification","52 pages",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce a new, spectral notion of approximation between
directed graphs, which we call Singular Value (SV) approximation.
SV-approximation is stronger than previous notions of spectral approximation
considered in the literature, including spectral approximation of Laplacians
for undirected graphs (Spielman Teng STOC 2004), standard approximation for
directed graphs (Cohen et. al. STOC 2007), and unit-circle approximation for
directed graphs (Ahmadinejad et. al. FOCS 2020). Moreover, SV approximation
enjoys several useful properties not known to be possessed by previous notions
of approximation, such as being preserved under products of random-walk
matrices and with matrices of bounded norm.
  Notably, we show that there is a simple black-box reduction from
SV-sparsifying Eulerian directed graphs to SV-sparsifying undirected graphs.
With this reduction in hand, we provide a nearly linear-time algorithm for
SV-sparsifying undirected and hence also Eulerian directed graphs. This also
yields the first nearly linear-time algorithm for unit-circle-sparsifying
Eulerian directed graphs. In addition, we give a nearly linear-time algorithm
for SV-sparsifying (and UC-sparsifying) random-walk polynomials of Eulerian
directed graphs with second normalized singular value bounded away from $1$ by
$1/\text{poly}(n)$.
  Finally, we show that a simple repeated-squaring and sparsification algorithm
for solving Laplacian systems, introduced by (Peng Spielman STOC 2014) for
undirected graphs, also works for Eulerian digraphs whose random-walk matrix is
normal (i.e. unitarily diagonalizable), if we use SV-sparsification at each
step. Prior Laplacian solvers for Eulerian digraphs are significantly more
complicated.

properties of reactive systems. We study coverability in the equivalent model:
Vector Addition Systems with States (VASS).
  A k-VASS can be seen as k counters and a finite automaton whose transitions
are labelled with k integers. Counter values are updated by adding the
respective transition labels. A configuration in this system consists of a
state and k counter values. Importantly, the counters are never allowed to take
negative values. The coverability problem asks whether one can traverse the
k-VASS from the initial configuration to a configuration with at least the
counter values of the target.
  In a well-established line of work on k-VASS, coverability in 2-VASS is
already PSPACE-hard when the integer updates are encoded in binary. This lower
bound limits the practicality of applications, so it is natural to focus on
restrictions. In this paper we initiate the study of 2-VASS with one unary
counter. Here, one counter receives binary encoded updates and the other
receives unary encoded updates. Our main result is that coverability in 2-VASS
with one unary counter is in NP. This improves upon the inherited
state-of-the-art PSPACE upper bound. Our main technical contribution is that
one only needs to consider runs in a certain compressed linear form.

their material parameters to change in time according to an evolution operator
learned from data. This leads to a flexible hybrid model combining a
data-driven encoder and a physics-based decoder. Apart from introducing
physics-motivated bias to the resulting surrogate, the internal variables of
the decoder act as a memory mechanism that allows path dependency to arise
naturally. We demonstrate the capabilities of the approach by combining an FNN
encoder with several plasticity decoders and training the model to reproduce
the macroscopic behavior of fiber-reinforced composites. The hybrid models are
able to provide reasonable predictions of unloading/reloading behavior while
being trained exclusively on monotonic data. Furthermore, in contrast to
traditional surrogates mapping strains to stresses, the specific architecture
of the hybrid model allows for lossless dimensionality reduction and
straightforward enforcement of frame invariance by using strain invariants as
the feature space of the encoder.

charge transport in semiconducting diode, is a nonreciprocity of
dissipationless supercurrent. Such an exotic phenomenon originates from
intertwining between symmetry-constrained supercurrent transport and intrinsic
quantum functionalities of helical/chiral superconductors. In this article,
research progress of superconducting diode effect including fundamental
concepts, material aspects, device prospects, and theoretical/experimental
development is reviewed. First, fundamental mechanisms to cause superconducting
diode effect including simultaneous space-inversion and time-reversal symmetry
breaking, magnetochiral anisotropy, interplay between spin-orbit interaction
energy and the characteristic energy scale of supercurrent carriers, and
finite-momentum Cooper pairing are discussed. Second, the progress of
superconducting diode effect from theoretical predictions to experimental
observations are reviewed. Third, interplay between various system parameters
leading to superconducting diode effect with optimal performance is presented.
Then, it is explicitly highlighted that nonreciprocity of supercurrent can be
characterized either by current-voltage relation obtained from resistive
direct-current measurements in the metal-superconductor fluctuation region
($T\approx T_c$) or by current-phase relation and nonreciprocity of superfluid
inductance obtained from alternating-current measurements in the
superconducting phase ($T<T_c$). Finally, insight into future directions in
this active research field is provided with a perspective analysis on
intertwining between band-topology and helical superconductivity, which could
be useful to steer the engineering of emergent topological superconducting
technologies.

asymptotic properties (e.g., consistency and asymptotic normalities),
non-asymptotic properties (e.g., unbiasedness and generalization error bound),
and a Monte--Carlo-based solution method of the proposed model are studied. The

near-infrared spectroscopy, multiwavelength photometry, and low-resolution
near-infrared spectroscopy, over a total duration of six months (30 rotational
cycles). We analyzed the photometric and line profile variability to
characterize the accretion and ejection processes. The luminosity of the system
is modulated by surface spots at the stellar rotation period of 6.04 days. The
Balmer, Paschen, and Brackett hydrogen lines as well as the HeI 5876 A and HeI
10830 A line profiles are modulated on the same period. The PaB line flux
correlates with the photometric excess in the u' band, which suggests that most
of the line emission originates from the accretion process. High-velocity
redshifted absorptions reaching below the continuum periodically appear in the
near-infrared line profiles at the rotational phase in which the veiling and
line fluxes are the largest. These are signatures of a stable accretion funnel
flow and associated accretion shock at the stellar surface. This large-scale
magnetospheric accretion structure appears fairly stable over at least 15 and
possibly up to 30 rotational periods. In contrast, outflow signatures randomly
appear as blueshifted absorption components in the Balmer and HeI 10830 A line
profiles and disappear on a timescale of a few days. The coexistence of a
stable, large-scale accretion pattern and episodic outflows supports
magnetospheric ejections as the main process occurring at the star-disk
interface. Stable magnetospheric accretion and episodic outflows appear to be
physically linked on a scale of a few stellar radii in this system.

semi-supervised image classification task, resulting in a new method named
NP-Match. NP-Match is suited to this task for two reasons. Firstly, NP-Match
implicitly compares data points when making predictions, and as a result, the
prediction of each unlabeled data point is affected by the labeled data points
that are similar to it, which improves the quality of pseudo-labels. Secondly,
NP-Match is able to estimate uncertainty that can be used as a tool for
selecting unlabeled samples with reliable pseudo-labels. Compared with
uncertainty-based SSL methods implemented with Monte-Carlo (MC) dropout,
NP-Match estimates uncertainty with much less computational overhead, which can
save time at both the training and the testing phases. We conducted extensive
experiments on five public datasets under three semi-supervised image
classification settings, namely, the standard semi-supervised image
classification, the imbalanced semi-supervised image classification, and the

system maintenance and operations, as it bridges the gap between fault
detection and system recovery. Existing works mainly study multidimensional
localization or graph-based root cause localization. This paper opens up the
possibilities of exploiting the recently developed framework of explainable AI
(XAI) for the purpose of RCA. In particular, we propose BALANCE (BAyesian
Linear AttributioN for root CausE localization), which formulates the problem
of RCA through the lens of attribution in XAI and seeks to explain the
anomalies in the target KPIs by the behavior of the candidate root causes.
BALANCE consists of three innovative components. First, we propose a Bayesian
multicollinear feature selection (BMFS) model to predict the target KPIs given
the candidate root causes in a forward manner while promoting sparsity and
concurrently paying attention to the correlation between the candidate root
causes. Second, we introduce attribution analysis to compute the attribution
score for each candidate in a backward manner. Third, we merge the estimated
root causes related to each KPI if there are multiple KPIs. We extensively
evaluate the proposed BALANCE method on one synthesis dataset as well as three
real-world RCA tasks, that is, bad SQL localization, container fault
localization, and fault type diagnosis for Exathlon. Results show that BALANCE
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of accuracy with the
least amount of running time, and achieves at least $6\%$ notably higher
accuracy than SOTA methods for real tasks. BALANCE has been deployed to
production to tackle real-world RCA problems, and the online results further
advocate its usage for real-time diagnosis in distributed data systems.

vulnerabilities in a network or system. By determining which ports are open, an
attacker can identify which services and applications are running on a device
and potentially exploit any known vulnerabilities in those services.
Consequently, it is important to detect port scanning because it is often the
first step in a cyber attack. By identifying port scanning attempts,
cybersecurity professionals can take proactive measures to protect the systems
and networks before an attacker has a chance to exploit any vulnerabilities.
Against this background, researchers have worked for over a decade to develop
robust methods to detect port scanning. While there have been various surveys,
none have focused solely on machine learning based detection schemes specific
to port scans. Accordingly, we provide a systematic review of 15 papers

feature space representation of a set of segmented point clouds to match
between the current scene and the prior map. We show that down-sampling in the
inner layers of the network can significantly reduce computation time without
sacrificing performance. We present substantial evaluation of LIDAR-based
global localization methods on nine scenarios from six datasets varying between
urban, park, forest, and industrial environments. Part of which includes
post-processed data from 30 sequences of the Oxford RobotCar dataset, which we

reduction of computation, 70% lower memory consumption with marginal loss in
localization frequency. The proposed method allows the full pipeline to run on
robots with limited computation payload such as drones, quadrupeds, and UGVs as

either imputation, prior to fitting any predictive algorithms, or dedicated

exhibits good predictive performance. In this paper, we study the impact of
imputation in a high-dimensional linear model with MCAR missing data. We prove
that zero imputation performs an implicit regularization closely related to the

experimentally investigated, using density-matched fluids. A gravity-driven
flow is established, with a jet of saltwater emerging into an ambient medium
composed of high-viscosity propylene glycol. Jet Reynolds numbers Re ranging
from 1600 to 3400 were studied, for an ambient-to-jet viscosity ratio M between
1 and 50. Visualization suggests that at low values of the viscosity ratio, the
jet breakdown mode is axisymmetric, while helical modes develop at high values
of viscosity ratio. The transition between these two modes is attempted to be
delineated using a variety of diagnostic tools. Hot film anemometry
measurements indicate that the onset of the helical mode was accompanied by the
observation of a discrete peak in the frequency spectrum of velocity
fluctuations, which exhibited little spatial variation for the first several
diameters in the downstream direction. Dye injection accompanied by
Laser-Induced Fluorescence was used to identify the jet boundary against the
background. An analysis of high-speed images acquired using the LIF technique
enables identification of the spatial growth rate of waves on the jet boundary,
as well as the frequency of oscillation of the weakly diffusive interface.
Temporal fluctuations in of fluorescence intensity are found to be spatially
invariant in the jet near-field, further attesting to behavior consistent with
that of a self-sustained oscillation whose frequency depends on the viscosity
ratio. Singular Value Decomposition was used to analyze the images and identify
the various spatial modes, and suggests the existence of a single dominant
mode. Together, thee observations provide strong circumstantial evidence for
the ecidence of a glonal mode that arises solely due to viscosity variation in
a jet flow, without any additional effects due to density variations.

that the set of the equilibria may not be convex, providing a sharp divide with

formulation of two dimensional (2-D) Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations is
considered as the governing equation and the simulations are performed for
different distances of the control plate ($0.5$, $1$, $2$, $3$), rotational
rates ($0.5$, $1$, $2.07$, $3.25$) at Prandtl number $0.7$ and Reynolds number
$150$. The governing equations are discretized using the Higher Order Compact

discretization, is solved using the Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilized approach.
Present computed results show that the vortex shedding plane is shifted upward
from the centerline of the flow domain by the cylinder's rotational motion. The
structure of the wake varies based on the plate's position. The size of
vortices is greatly reduced when the control plate is set at $d/R_0=3$ and the
rotational rate is very high. At greater rotational rates, the impact of varied
positions of the arc-shaped control plate is very significant. The rotation of
the cylinder and the location of the plate can be used to lower or enhance the
values of drag and lift coefficients as well as the heat transfer from the
surface of the cylinder. The maximum value of the drag coefficient, which is
about $3$, is achieved for $d/R_0=2$ and $\alpha=3.25$.

large datasets in quantile regression models to forecast the conditional
distribution of US GDP growth. To capture possible non-linearities we include
several nonlinear specifications. The resulting models will be huge dimensional

estimation becomes slow in these dimensions, we rely on fast variational Bayes
approximations to the posterior distribution of the coefficients and the latent

These gains are especially pronounced in the tails. Using Gaussian processes to

which means that vector-valued functions are represented by continuous linear
operators. The first question we face is which vector-valued functions may be
represented by continuous linear operators where vector-valued means that the
functions have values in a locally convex Hausdorff space $E$. We study this
problem in the framework of $\varepsilon$-products and give sufficient
conditions when a space of $E$-valued functions coincides (up to an
isomorphism) with the $\varepsilon$-product of a corresponding space of
scalar-valued functions and the codomain $E$. We apply our linearisation
results to lift results that are known for the scalar-valued case to the
vector-valued case. We transfer the solvability of a linear partial
differential equation in certain function spaces from the scalar-valued case to
the vector-valued case, which also gives an affirmative answer to the question
of (continuous, smooth, holomorphic, distributional, etc.) parameter dependence
of solutions in the scalar-valued case. Further, we give a unified approach to
handle the problem of extending vector-valued functions via the existence of
weak extensions under the constraint of preserving the properties, like
holomorphy, of the scalar-valued extensions. Our approach also covers
weak-strong principles. In particular, we study weak-strong principles for
continuously partially differentiable functions of finite order and improve the
well-known weak-strong principles of Grothendieck and Schwartz. We use our
results to derive Blaschke's convergence theorem for several spaces of
vector-valued functions and Wolff's theorem for the description of dual spaces
of several function spaces of scalar-valued functions. Moreover, we transfer
known series expansions and sequence space representations from scalar-valued

characteristics that have been explored by previous work. Based on our

contextual aspects into eight categories: (1) audio features, (2) visual
features, (3) textual features, (4) instructor behavior, (5) learners

(8) instructional design. Also, we identify four representative research

design guidelines for learning videos. We find that the most explored
characteristics are textual features followed by visual features, learner
activities, and interactive features. Text of transcripts, video frames, and

support learning through videos. The learner activity is heavily explored
through log files in data analysis studies, and interactive features have been

Edge computing is considered a key infrastructure to deploy such applications,
as moving computation close to the data sources enables us to meet stringent

networks poses several additional challenges to the management of inference
workloads: edge clusters can not provide unlimited processing power to DNN
models, and often a trade-off between network and processing time should be
considered when it comes to end-to-end delay requirements. In this paper, we
focus on the problem of scheduling inference queries on DNN models in edge
networks at short timescales (i.e., few milliseconds). By means of simulations,
we analyze several policies in the realistic network settings and workloads of
a large ISP, highlighting the need for a dynamic scheduling policy that can
adapt to network conditions and workloads. We therefore design ASET, a
Reinforcement Learning based scheduling algorithm able to adapt its decisions
according to the system conditions. Our results show that ASET effectively
provides the best performance compared to static policies when scheduling over

is regularly computed, and analytically derived response functions relate the
Lagrangian spectrum of the fluid- and the particle phase. However, due to the
periodic nature of the Fourier basis, the analysis is restricted to
statistically stationary flows. In the present work, utilizing the bases of
time-focalized proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), this analysis is extended
to temporally non-stationary turbulence. Studying two-way coupled
particle-laden decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence for various Stokes
numbers, it is demonstrated that the temporal POD modes extracted from the
dispersed phase may be used for the expansion of both fluid- and particle
velocities. The POD Lagrangian spectrum of each phase may thus be computed from
the same set of modal building blocks, allowing the evaluation of response
functions in a POD frame of reference. Based on empirical evaluations, a model
for response functions in non-stationary flows is proposed. The related
energies of the two phases is well approximated by simple analytical
expressions dependent on the particle Stokes number. It is found that the
analytical expressions closely resemble those derived through Fourier analysis
of statistically stationary flows. These results suggest the existence of an
inherent spectral symmetry underlying the dynamical systems consisting of
particle-laden turbulence, a symmetry which spans across
stationary/non-stationary particle-laden flow states.

fluctuations at one-loop order. Using the renormalizability of the model, we
absorb the ultraviolet divergences into suitable counter-terms that are added
respecting the original structure of the theory. These counter-terms are
determined from the stability conditions which require the effective potential
to have minima in the condensates directions at the classical values, as well
as the transition from the non-condensed to the condensed phase to be smooth as
a function of the isospin chemical potential. We use the model to study the
evolution of the condensates as well as the pressure, energy and isospin
densities and the sound velocity as functions of the isospin chemical
potential. The approach does a good average description up to isospin chemical
potentials values not too large as compared to the vacuum pion mass.

complicated functions by an active learning-based sequential decomposition of
the input random space and construction of localized polynomial chaos
expansions, referred to as domain adaptive localized polynomial chaos expansion
(DAL-PCE). The approach utilizes sequential decomposition of the input random
space into smaller sub-domains approximated by low-order polynomial expansions.
This allows approximation of functions with strong nonlinearties,
discontinuities, and/or singularities. Decomposition of the input random space
and local approximations alleviates the Gibbs phenomenon for these types of
problems and confines error to a very small vicinity near the non-linearity.
The global behavior of the surrogate model is therefore significantly better
than existing methods as shown in numerical examples. The whole process is
driven by an active learning routine that uses the recently proposed $\Theta$
criterion to assess local variance contributions. The proposed approach
balances both \emph{exploitation} of the surrogate model and \emph{exploration}
of the input random space and thus leads to efficient and accurate
approximation of the original mathematical model. The numerical results show
the superiority of the DAL-PCE in comparison to (i) a single global polynomial
chaos expansion and (ii) the recently proposed stochastic spectral embedding
(SSE) method developed as an accurate surrogate model and which is based on a
similar domain decomposition process. This method represents general framework
upon which further extensions and refinements can be based, and which can be
combined with any technique for non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion
construction.

quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models struggle to predict
ACs and that ACs thus form a major source of prediction error. However, a study
to explore the AC-prediction power of modern QSAR methods and its relationship
to general QSAR-prediction performance is lacking. We systematically construct
nine distinct QSAR models by combining three molecular representation methods
(extended-connectivity fingerprints, physicochemical-descriptor vectors and
graph isomorphism networks) with three regression techniques (random forests,
k-nearest neighbours and multilayer perceptrons); we then use each resulting
model to classify pairs of similar compounds as ACs or non-ACs and to predict
the activities of individual molecules in three case studies: dopamine receptor
D2, factor Xa, and SARS-CoV-2 main protease. We observe low AC-sensitivity
amongst the tested models when the activities of both compounds are unknown,
but a substantial increase in AC-sensitivity when the actual activity of one of
the compounds is given. Graph isomorphism features are found to be competitive
with or superior to classical molecular representations for AC-classification
and can thus be employed as baseline AC-prediction models or simple
compound-optimisation tools. For general QSAR-prediction, however,
extended-connectivity fingerprints still consistently deliver the best
performance. Our results provide strong support for the hypothesis that indeed
QSAR methods frequently fail to predict ACs. We propose twin-network training
for deep learning models as a potential future pathway to increase
AC-sensitivity and thus overall QSAR performance.

seems to be more difficult than it appears at first glance. Let $L$ be a finite
extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ with ring of integers $o_L$ and let $\mathbb{C}_p$
denote the completion of an algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}_p$. In their work
on $p$-adic Fourier theory, Schneider and Teitelbaum defined and studied the
character variety $\mathfrak{X}$. This character variety is a rigid analytic
curve over $L$ that parameterizes the set of locally $L$-analytic characters
$\lambda : (o_L,+) \to (\mathbb{C}_p^\times,\times)$. One of the main results
of Schneider and Teitelbaum is that over $\mathbb{C}_p$, the curve
$\mathfrak{X}$ becomes isomorphic to the open unit disk. Let
$\Lambda_L(\mathfrak{X})$ denote the ring of bounded-by-one functions on
$\mathfrak{X}$. If $\mu \in o_L [\![o_L]\!]$ is a measure on $o_L$, then
$\lambda \mapsto \mu(\lambda)$ gives rise to an element of
$\Lambda_L(\mathfrak{X})$. The resulting map $o_L [\![o_L]\!] \to
\Lambda_L(\mathfrak{X})$ is injective. The question is: do we have
$\Lambda_L(\mathfrak{X}) = o_L [\![o_L]\!]$?
  In this paper, we prove various results that were obtained while studying
this question. In particular, we give several criteria for a positive answer to
the above question. We also recall and prove the ``Katz isomorphism'' that
describes the dual of a certain space of continuous functions on $o_L$. An
important part of our paper is devoted to providing a proof of this theorem
which was stated in 1977 by Katz. We then show how it applies to the question.
Besides $p$-adic Fourier theory, the above question is related to the theory of
formal groups, the theory of integer valued polynomials on $o_L$, $p$-adic
Hodge theory, and Iwasawa theory.

standard setting without monetary transfers, it is generally impossible to have
truthful mechanisms that provide non-trivial fairness guarantees. Recently,
Amanatidis et al. [2021] suggested the study of mechanisms that produce fair

equilibria and the corresponding allocations are envy-free up to one good (EF1)

show that this outstanding property of the Round-Robin mechanism extends much
beyond the above default assumption of additivity. In particular, we prove that
for agents with cancelable valuation functions (a natural class that contains,
e.g., additive and budget-additive functions), this simple mechanism always has
equilibria and even its approximate equilibria correspond to approximately EF1
allocations with respect to the agents' true valuation functions. Further, we

are problems in which a principal commits to an outcome-dependent payment
scheme in order to incentivize some agents to take costly, unobservable actions
that lead to favorable outcomes. Previous works on multi-agent problems study
models where the principal observes a single outcome determined by the actions
of all the agents. Such models considerably limit the contracting power of the
principal, since payments can only depend on the joint result of all the
agents' actions, and there is no way of paying each agent for their individual
result. In this paper, we consider a model in which each agent determines their
own individual outcome as an effect of their action only, the principal
observes all the individual outcomes separately, and they perceive a reward
that jointly depends on all these outcomes. This considerably enhances the
principal's contracting capabilities, by allowing them to pay each agent on the
basis of their individual result. We analyze the computational complexity of
finding principal-optimal contracts, revolving around two newly-introduced
properties of principal's rewards, which we call IR-supermodularity and
DR-submodularity. Intuitively, the former captures settings with increasing
returns, where the rewards grow faster as the agents' effort increases, while
the latter models the case of diminishing returns, in which rewards grow slower
instead. These two properties naturally model two common real-world phenomena,
namely diseconomies and economies of scale. In this paper, we first address
basic instances in which the principal knows everything about the agents, and,
then, more general Bayesian instances where each agent has their own private
type determining their features, such as action costs and how actions
stochastically determine individual outcomes.

reconstruction from point clouds is particularly challenging when applied to

However, hyperparameter tuning for adjusting priors to different acquisition
defects can be a tedious task. To this end, the deep learning community has
recently addressed the surface reconstruction problem. In contrast to
traditional approaches, deep surface reconstruction methods can learn priors
directly from a training set of point clouds and corresponding true surfaces.

the robustness of methods to defect-laden input and their capability to
generate geometric and topologically accurate reconstructions. In our
benchmark, we evaluate the reconstructions of several traditional and
learning-based methods on the same grounds. We show that learning-based methods

surrounded by a layer. The main features of this problem are twofold: on one
hand, the layer is thin compared to the scale of the domain, and on the other
hand, the thermal conductivity of the layer is drastically different from that
of the bulk; moreover, the bulk is isotropic, but the layer is anisotropic and
``optimally aligned"" in the sense that any vector in the layer normal to the
interface is an eigenvector of the thermal tensor. We study the effects of the
layer by thinking of it as a thickless surface, on which ``effective boundary
conditions"" (EBCs) are imposed. In the three-dimensional case, we obtain EBCs
by investigating the limiting solution of the initial boundary value problem
subject to either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions as the thickness of
the layer shrinks to zero. These EBCs contain not only the standard boundary
conditions but also some nonlocal ones, including the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
mapping and the fractional Laplacian. One of the main features of this work is
to allow the drastic difference in the thermal conductivity in the normal
direction and two tangential directions within the layer.

complex, and new actors and strategies have emerged as a result of this seismic

opinion formation, which have been facilitated on a large scale by social media
platforms, the changing role of traditional media and the emerging role of
""influencers"" are not well understood, and the implications of their engagement
strategies arising from the incentive structure of the attention economy even
less so. Here we propose a novel opinion dynamics model that accounts for these
different roles, namely that media and influencers change their own positions
on slower time scales than individuals, while influencers dynamically gain and
lose followers. Numerical simulations show the importance of their relative
influence in creating qualitatively different opinion formation dynamics: with
influencers, fragmented but short-lived clusters emerge, which are then
counteracted by more stable media positions. Mean-field approximations by
partial differential equations reproduce this dynamic. Based on the mean-field
model, we study how strategies of influencers to gain more followers can
influence the overall opinion distribution. We show that moving towards extreme
positions can be a beneficial strategy for influencers to gain followers.
Finally, we demonstrate that optimal control strategies allow other influencers
or media to counteract such attempts and prevent further fragmentation of the
opinion landscape. Our modelling framework contributes to better understanding
the different roles and strategies in the increasingly complex information
ecosystem and their impact on public opinion formation.

limitations in the diversity of expressiveness, as these models can only
generate the pre-defined styles. (2) Using reference speech as style input,
which results in a problem that the extracted style information is not

as style prompt to control the styles in the synthetic speech, \textit{e.g.},
``Sigh tone in full of sad mood with some helpless feeling"". Considering that
there is no existing TTS corpus which is proper to benchmark this novel task,
we first construct a speech corpus, whose speech samples are annotated with not

cluster states can, under ideal conditions, be generated in DOPO networks with
the help of beam splitters and classical pumps. Our subsequent numerical
analysis provides the minimum requirements for the generation of coherent

solving several optimization problems significant to humankind a tractable

overwhelming amount of candidate solutions to be evaluated, even by using
sophisticated algorithms. In such a context, a set of nature-inspired
stochastic methods, called meta-heuristic optimization, can provide robust
approximate solutions to different kinds of problems with a small computational
burden, such as derivative-free real function optimization. Nevertheless, these
methods may converge to inadequate solutions if the function landscape is too
harsh, e.g., enclosing too many local optima. Previous works addressed this
issue by employing a hypercomplex representation of the search space, like
quaternions, where the landscape becomes smoother and supposedly easier to
optimize. Under this approach, meta-heuristic computations happen in the
hypercomplex space, whereas variables are mapped back to the real domain before
function evaluation. Despite this latter operation being performed by the
Euclidean norm, we have found that after the optimization procedure has
finished, it is usually possible to obtain even better solutions by employing
the Minkowski $p$-norm instead and fine-tuning $p$ through an auxiliary
sub-problem with neglecting additional cost and no hyperparameters. Such
behavior was observed in eight well-established benchmarking functions, thus
fostering a new research direction for hypercomplex meta-heuristic

planning and navigation workflows. U-Net variants are known to provide
excellent results in supervised semantic segmentation. However, in distinct
bone segmentation from upper body CTs a large field of view and a
computationally taxing 3D architecture are required. This leads to
low-resolution results lacking detail or localisation errors due to missing
spatial context when using high-resolution inputs.
  Methods: We propose to solve this problem by using end-to-end trainable
segmentation networks that combine several 3D U-Nets working at different
resolutions. Our approach, which extends and generalizes HookNet and MRN,
captures spatial information at a lower resolution and skips the encoded
information to the target network, which operates on smaller high-resolution
inputs. We evaluated our proposed architecture against single resolution
networks and performed an ablation study on information concatenation and the
number of context networks.
  Results: Our proposed best network achieves a median DSC of 0.86 taken over
all 125 segmented bone classes and reduces the confusion among similar-looking
bones in different locations. These results outperform our previously published
3D U-Net baseline results on the task and distinct-bone segmentation results
reported by other groups.
  Conclusion: The presented multi-resolution 3D U-Nets address current
shortcomings in bone segmentation from upper-body CT scans by allowing for
capturing a larger field of view while avoiding the cubic growth of the input
pixels and intermediate computations that quickly outgrow the computational
capacities in 3D. The approach thus improves the accuracy and efficiency of
distinct bone segmentation from upper-body CT.

dimension not exceeding one, admitting only morphisms whose kernels and
cokernels are also objects in this subclass. This class is still tractable,
several features are in general simpler than in module categories, but lots of
familiar properties are lost. A number of results on modules in this class are
similar to those on modules over rank one discrete valuation domains (where the
global dimension is 1). The study is considerably simplified by taking
advantage of the general theory of modules over valuation domains available in
the literature, e.g. in [14]-[15]. Our main goal is to establish the basic
features and have a closer look at injectivity, pure-injectivity, and
cotorsionness, but we do not wish to enter into an in-depth study of these
properties.

forward shock expanding in the host galaxy and a wind termination shock
separating the fast cool wind from the hot shocked wind. In this work we
explore whether diffusive shock acceleration can take place efficiently at the
wind termination shock of UFOs. We calculate the spectrum of accelerated
particles and find that protons can be energized up to the EeV range promoting
UFOs to promising candidates for accelerating ultra-high energy cosmic rays
(UHECRs). We also compute the associated gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes and
compare them with available data in the literature. We observe that high-energy
(HE) neutrinos are efficiently produced up to hundreds of PeV while the
associated gamma rays are efficiently absorbed beyond a few tens of GeV. By
assuming a typical source density of non-jetted AGNi we expect that UFO could
play a dominant role as diffuse sources of UHECRs and HE neutrinos. We finally
apply our model to the recently observed NGC1068 and we find out that an
obscured UFO could provide a sizeable contribution to the observed gamma-ray
flux while only contributing up to $\sim 10\%$ to the associated neutrino flux.

prediction performances, how to extract more useful information and make

on a short range of information, which are fatal for problems such as time
series forecasting which needs to capture long-term information
characteristics. As a result, the main concern of this work is to further mine
relationship between local and global information contained in time series to
produce more precise predictions. In this paper, to satisfactorily realize the
purpose, we make three main contributions that are experimentally verified to
have performance advantages. Firstly, original time series is transformed into
difference sequence which serves as input to the proposed model. And secondly,
we introduce the global atrous sliding window into the forecasting model which
references the concept of fuzzy time series to associate relevant global
information with temporal data within a time period and utilizes
central-bidirectional atrous algorithm to capture underlying-related features
to ensure validity and consistency of captured data. Thirdly, a variation of
widely-used asymmetric convolution which is called semi-asymmetric convolution
is devised to more flexibly extract relationships in adjacent elements and
corresponding associated global features with adjustable ranges of convolution
on vertical and horizontal directions. The proposed model in this paper

phonon energy scale and inversely with respect to the electron-phonon coupling.
These findings are partially in contrast to other theoretical studies and show
that superconductivity in LiC$_{6}$ is more peculiar than previously
anticipated. In this context, the guidelines for enhancing superconducting
phase in LiC$_{6}$ and sibling materials are also proposed.

generalization of deep neural networks remains a challenge, complicated by the
fact that networks can operate in distinct training regimes. Here we study how
the magnitude of this noise $T$ affects performance as the size of the training
set $P$ and the scale of initialization $\alpha$ are varied. For gradient
descent, $\alpha$ is a key parameter that controls if the network is
`lazy'($\alpha\gg1$) or instead learns features ($\alpha\ll1$). For
classification of MNIST and CIFAR10 images, our central results are: (i)
obtaining phase diagrams for performance in the $(\alpha,T)$ plane. They show
that SGD noise can be detrimental or instead useful depending on the training
regime. Moreover, although increasing $T$ or decreasing $\alpha$ both allow the
net to escape the lazy regime, these changes can have opposite effects on
performance. (ii) Most importantly, we find that the characteristic temperature
$T_c$ where the noise of SGD starts affecting the trained model (and eventually
performance) is a power law of $P$. We relate this finding with the observation
that key dynamical quantities, such as the total variation of weights during
training, depend on both $T$ and $P$ as power laws. These results indicate that
a key effect of SGD noise occurs late in training by affecting the stopping
process whereby all data are fitted. Indeed, we argue that due to SGD noise,
nets must develop a stronger `signal', i.e. larger informative weights, to fit
the data, leading to a longer training time. A stronger signal and a longer
training time are also required when the size of the training set $P$
increases. We confirm these views in the perceptron model, where signal and
noise can be precisely measured. Interestingly, exponents characterizing the
effect of SGD depend on the density of data near the decision boundary, as we
explain.

finite element (CPFE) modelling using static and grain-based meshing to
investigate the dependence of the results on the discretization approach.
Static mesh refers to the integration point-based representation of the
microstructure in which the integration points (IPs) within a finite element
may belong to different grains, while in the grain-based meshing the minimum
discretization unit is an element that may only belong to one grain. The
crystal plasticity constitutive law was coded using UMAT subroutine within
commercial finite element software Abaqus. Multiple sets of RVEs were
investigated under strain-controlled loading and periodic boundary conditions.
The stress and strain contour maps obtained from RVEs with static mesh and
grain-based mesh were compared. The simulation results reveal that both
discretization methods provide reliable predictions of the stress-strain curves
and the stress/strain localization points in polycrystalline alloys. Static
mesh tends to smooth the stress/strain profile at the grain boundary, whilst
stress/strain discontinuities are present in the grain-based mesh results. The
above findings remain valid when the number of grains within an RVE increases
from 34 to 1250. To quantify the difference between static and grain-based
meshing, a relative measure of deviation is defined. The deviations of global
stress were found to be relatively small, within 0.5%, while local deviations
were significant up to 50%. Static mesh has the advantage of reducing both the
preprocessing procedures and computational time compared to grain-based mesh.
It is concluded that static mesh is preferred when investigating the material's
macroscopic behaviour, whilst grain-based mesh is recommended for the study of
the local response using CPFEM.

comprehensive investigation of the impact of IC cooling in CWBs, presenting
general results for when the photon fields of the stars dominate the cooling of
the thermal plasma and when shocks at the stagnation point are expected to be
radiative. Our analysis shows that IC cooling is the primary cooling process
for the shocked-wind layer over a significant portion of the relevant parameter
space, particularly in eccentric systems with large wind-momentum ratios, e.g.,
those containing a Wolf-Rayet and O-type star. Using the binary system WR140 as
a case study, we demonstrate that IC cooling leads to a strongly radiative
shocked wind near periastron, which may otherwise remain adiabatic if only
collisional cooling was considered. Our results are further supported by 2D and
3D simulations, which illustrate the impact of including or neglecting IC
cooling. Specifically, 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of WR140 show a
significant decrease in hard-X-ray emission around periastron, in agreement
with observations but in contrast to equivalent simulations that omit IC
cooling. A novel method is proposed for constraining mass-loss rates of both
stars in eccentric binaries where the wind-collision zone switches from
adiabatic to radiative approaching periastron. This study highlights the
importance of including the IC process for thermal electrons in theoretical and

electric networks obey Kirchoff's laws, and social networks display opinion
consensus. Such conservation laws are often modeled as balance equations that
relate appropriate injected flows and potentials at the nodes of the networks.
A recent line of work considers the problem of estimating the unknown structure
of such networked systems from observations of node potentials (and only the
knowledge of the statistics of injected flows). Given the dynamic nature of the
systems under consideration, an equally important task is estimating the change
in the structure of the network from data -- the so called differential network

goal is to estimate the structural differences between the underlying networks.
We formulate this novel differential network analysis problem for systems

This ability, known as continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems

explicitly limited by catastrophic forgetting, where learning a new task
usually results in a dramatic performance drop of the old tasks. Beyond this,
increasingly numerous advances have emerged in recent years that largely extend
the understanding and application of continual learning. The growing and
widespread interest in this direction demonstrates its realistic significance
as well as complexity. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of
continual learning, seeking to bridge the basic settings, theoretical
foundations, representative methods, and practical applications. Based on
existing theoretical and empirical results, we summarize the general objectives
of continual learning as ensuring a proper stability-plasticity trade-off and
an adequate intra/inter-task generalizability in the context of resource
efficiency. Then we provide a state-of-the-art and elaborated taxonomy,
extensively analyzing how representative strategies address continual learning,
and how they are adapted to particular challenges in various applications.
Through an in-depth discussion of continual learning in terms of the current
trends, cross-directional prospects and interdisciplinary connections with

constants. Thus, the time it spends as a main-sequence star can be expected to
depend on whether or not such constants vary over the time scale of stellar
evolution. When the star belongs to a globular cluster, the star's age cannot
exceed that of the globular cluster, and the latter cannot exceed the age of
the Universe. This fact can be used to constrain or verify the variation of the
coupling constants, i.e., the speed of light c, the gravitational constant G,
the Planck constant h, and the Boltzmann constant k. We have estimated the age
of the main-sequence star analytically from the time it takes to synthesize all
its hydrogen into helium under fixed and varying coupling constants scenarios.
When we permitted the interrelated variation of the four constants ($G\thicksim
c^{3}\thicksim h^{3}\thicksim k^{3/2}$) and differentiated between the
cosmological energy and local energy conservation laws, we could show that the
variation of the constants established in our earlier studies, i.e.,

simulation of chaotic systems in a long enough interval of time by means of

$\varepsilon_{0}$ to any required tiny level. A lot of successful applications

some strategies to greatly increase the computational efficiency of the CNS

detection systems that operate on byte-level data. Our certified defense is
based on the approach of randomized smoothing which we adapt by: (1) replacing
the standard Gaussian randomization scheme with a novel deletion randomization
scheme that operates on bytes or chunks of an executable; and (2) deriving a
certificate that measures robustness to evasion attacks in terms of generalized
edit distance. To assess the size of robustness certificates that are
achievable while maintaining high accuracy, we conduct experiments on malware
datasets using a popular convolutional malware detection model, MalConv. We are
able to accurately classify 91% of the inputs while being certifiably robust to
any adversarial perturbations of edit distance 128 bytes or less. By
comparison, an existing certification of up to 128 bytes of substitutions
(without insertions or deletions) achieves an accuracy of 78%. In addition,
given that robustness certificates are conservative, we evaluate practical
robustness to several recently published evasion attacks and, in some cases,
find robustness beyond certified guarantees.

as fractures provide preferential flow paths. However, estimating the

on observing data is a nontrivial task because inverse modeling of fractured
model is strongly nonlinear and non-Gaussian distributed. To address this
issue, a novel inverse modeling framework is proposed for the estimation of the
fracture networks. The hierarchical parameterization method is adopted in this
work. For a small number of large fractures, each fracture is characterized by
fracture length, azimuth and coordination of the fracture center. For dense
small fractures, fracture density and fractal dimension are utilized to
characterize the fracture networks. Moreover, we adopt variational auto-encoder
and generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN) and fuse the GAN objective with
prior constraint information to capture the distribution of the parameters of
complex fracture networks and to satisfy the prior knowledge of fracture
fields, thereby mapping the high-dimensional complex parameter distribution
into low-dimensional continuous parameter field. Afterwards, relying on the
Bayesian framework, ensemble smoother is adopted based on the collected data
from hydraulic tomography to reduce the uncertainty of the fracture
distribution. Two numerical cases with different complexity are used to test
the performance of the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed
algorithm can estimate effectively the distribution of the fracture fields

data, we obtain stable estimates of this TPT statistic, which is generalized to
frame the remaining duration of transition paths, a new TPT statistic suitable
for investigating connectivity.

  breaking materials","10 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It is known that materials with broken time-reversal symmetry can have Hall
responses. Here we show that in addition to the conventional currents, either
linear or nonlinear in the electric field, another Hall current can occur in
the time-reversal breaking materials within the second-order response to
in-plane electric and vertical magnetic fields. Such a Hall response is
generated by the oscillation of the electromagnetic field and has a quantum
origin arising from a novel dipole associated with the Berry curvature and band
velocity. We demonstrate that the massive Dirac model of LaAlO3/LaNiO3/LaAlO3
quantum well can be used to detect this Hall effect. Our work widens the theory
of the Hall effect in the time-reversal breaking materials by proposing a new
kind of nonlinear electromagnetic response.

  excitations",,,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.other cond-mat.quant-gas","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Topological defects and excitations of ground states determine the properties
of systems exhibiting collective order. We introduce a general framework that
comprehensively describes these excitations, including metastable
configurations and transient dynamics, and show that it delivers general
information for understanding and tailoring collective behaviors. We focus on
systems with $O(n)$ broken rotational symmetry described by order parameters
which are uniform in the ordered phase and vanish in the disordered phase. From
these smooth order parameters, we derive a non-singular defect density, a
conserved quantity that tracks both topological defects and non-linear
localized excitations. Its associated conserved density current is determined
by the evolution of the order parameter and describes defect dynamics. Within
this formalism, we explore fast events, such as defect nucleation/annihilation
and dynamical phase transitions where the interaction between excitations
becomes particularly important. In particular, we use this framework to
highlight the similar topological structures and precursory patterns for the
nucleation of topological defects in superfluid Bose-Einstein condensates,
active nematics, and crystal lattices. For the last two examples, where
translational symmetry is essential, our formalism also sheds light on a
hierarchy of topological defects associated with coexisting broken symmetries
and their role in dynamical transitions.

emission rate and discuss how electric charge, angular momentum, and exponents
affect them. In order to have an acceptable optical behavior, we should apply
some constraints on the exponents. We continue our investigation with the study
of the thermodynamic behavior of the solutions in the extended phase space and
examine the validity of the first law of thermodynamics besides local thermal
stability through using of heat capacity. Evaluating the existence of van der
Waals-like phase transition, we obtain critical quantities and show how they
change under the variation of black hole parameters. Finally, we construct a
holographic heat engine of such a black hole and obtain its efficiency in a
cycle. By comparing the obtained efficiency with the Carnot one, we examine the
second law of thermodynamics.

consistent formulation of electrodynamics in the presence of gravitation needs
to introduce an additional energy tensor: the interaction energy tensor. This
energy is gravitationally active and might contribute to the dark matter,
because it has an exotic character and it is not localized inside matter. In
order to check if that energy might form representative dark halos, one has to
model the interstellar radiation field in a galaxy as a complete
electromagnetic field obeying the Maxwell equations. A model has been built for
this purpose, based on assuming axial symmetry and on recent results about
axisymmetric Maxwell fields. Its predictions for the variation of the spectral
energy density inside our Galaxy are relatively close to those of a recent
radiation transfer model, except on the symmetry axis of the Galaxy, where the
present model predicts extremely high values of the energy density.

  Semantic Consistency",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, great success has been made in learning visual representations from
text supervision, facilitating the emergence of text-supervised semantic
segmentation. However, existing works focus on pixel grouping and cross-modal
semantic alignment, while ignoring the correspondence among multiple augmented
views of the same image. To overcome such limitation, we propose
multi-\textbf{View} \textbf{Co}nsistent learning (ViewCo) for text-supervised
semantic segmentation. Specifically, we first propose text-to-views consistency
modeling to learn correspondence for multiple views of the same input image.
Additionally, we propose cross-view segmentation consistency modeling to
address the ambiguity issue of text supervision by contrasting the segment
features of Siamese visual encoders. The text-to-views consistency benefits the
dense assignment of the visual features by encouraging different crops to align
with the same text, while the cross-view segmentation consistency modeling
provides additional self-supervision, overcoming the limitation of ambiguous
text supervision for segmentation masks. Trained with large-scale image-text
data, our model can directly segment objects of arbitrary categories in a
zero-shot manner. Extensive experiments show that ViewCo outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on average by up to 2.9\%, 1.6\%, and 2.4\% mIoU on
PASCAL VOC2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO, respectively.

One prominent methodology are Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) which
can solve both forward and inverse problems. In the paper at hand, full
waveform inversion is the considered inverse problem. The performance of PINNs
is compared against classical adjoint optimization, focusing on three key
aspects: the forward-solver, the neural network Ansatz for the inverse field,
and the sensitivity computation for the gradient-based minimization. Starting
from PINNs, each of these key aspects is adapted individually until the
classical adjoint optimization emerges. It is shown that it is beneficial to
use the neural network only for the discretization of the unknown material
field, where the neural network produces reconstructions without oscillatory
artifacts as typically encountered in classical full waveform inversion
approaches. Due to this finding, a hybrid approach is proposed. It exploits
both the efficient gradient computation with the continuous adjoint method as
well as the neural network Ansatz for the unknown material field. This new
hybrid approach outperforms Physics-Informed Neural Networks and the classical
adjoint optimization in settings of two and three-dimensional examples.

to synthesize mixed-genre dance movements of 3D human characters synchronized
with music. Our method learns to disentangle the dance movements at the beat
frames from the dance movements at all the remaining frames by operating at two
hierarchical levels. At the coarser ""beat"" level, it encodes the rhythm, pitch,
and melody information of the input music via dedicated feature representations
only at the beat frames. It leverages them to synthesize the beat poses of the
target dance using a sequence-to-sequence learning framework. At the finer
""repletion"" level, our method encodes similar rhythm, pitch, and melody
information from all the frames of the input music via dedicated feature
representations and couples them with the synthesized beat poses from the
coarser level to synthesize the full target dance sequence using an adversarial
learning framework. By disentangling the broader dancing styles at the coarser
level from the specific dance movements at the finer level, our method can
efficiently synthesize dances composed of arbitrarily mixed genres and styles.
We evaluate the performance of our approach through extensive experiments on
both the mixed-genre TikTok dance dataset and the single-genre AIST++ dataset
and observe improvements of about 2% in motion quality metrics and 1.6% - 5.9%
in motion diversity metrics over the current baselines in the two datasets
respectively. We also conducted a user study to evaluate the visual quality of
our synthesized dances. We noted that, on average, the samples generated by our
method were about 9% more preferred by the participants and had a 12% better
five-point Likert-scale score over the best available current baseline in terms
of motion quality and diversity.

The best model achieves 44.1\% mAP on COCO instance segmentation (test-dev

fault detection based on reinforcement learning and a policy known as proximal
policy optimization. As a result of the lack of fault data, one of the
significant problems with the traditional policy is its weakness in detecting
fault classes, which was addressed by changing the cost function. Using
modified Proximal Policy Optimization, we can increase performance, overcome
data imbalance, and better predict future faults. When our modified policy is
implemented, all evaluation metrics will increase by $3\%$ to $4\%$ as compared
to the traditional policy in the first benchmark, between $20\%$ and $55\%$ in
the second benchmark, and between $6\%$ and $14\%$ in the third benchmark, as
well as an improvement in performance and prediction speed compared to previous

functionality and selective cell uptake. However, whether proteins are packaged
stochastically or co-enriched within individual EVs, and whether co-enrichment
fluctuates under homeostasis and disease, has not been measured. EV abundance
and protein global relative expression have been qualified by bulk analysis.
Meanwhile, co-enrichment is not directly accessible via bulk measurement and
has not been reported for single EV analysis. Here, we introduce the normalized
index of co-enrichment (NICE) to measure protein co-enrichment. NICE was
derived by (i) capturing EVs based on the expression of a membrane-bound
protein, (ii) probing for the co-expression of a second protein at the
population level - EV integrity underwrites the detection of single EV
co-expression without the need to resolve single EVs - and (iii) normalizing
measured values using two universal normalization probes. Axiomatically, NICE =
1 for stochastic inclusion or no overall co-enrichment, while for positive and
negative co-enrichment NICE > 1 or < 1, respectively. We quantified the NICE of
tetraspanins, growth factor receptors and integrins in EVs of eight breast
cancer cell lines of varying metastatic potential and organotropism,
combinatorially mapping up to 104 protein pairs. Our analysis revealed protein
enrichment and co-expression patterns consistent with previous findings. For
the organotropic cell lines, most protein pairs were co-enriched on EVs, with
the majority of NICE values between 0.2 to 11.5, and extending from 0.037 to
80.4. Median NICE were either negative, neutral or positive depending on the

paper, we analyse the origin of the difference between the deposition of
suspended particles in a sessile drop and in an axisymmetric drop deposited on
a fibre. First, we model the shape of a drop on a fibre and its evaporative
flux with some approximations to derive analytical calculations. Then, for
pinned contact lines, we solve the hydrodynamics equations in the liquid phase
under the lubrication approximation to determine the flow velocity toward the

similar evaporating conditions, and we show that the substrate curvature plays
a role on the contact line depinning, the local evaporative flux, and the
liquid flow field. The competition between the advection and the Brownian
motion indicates that the transport of the particles toward the contact line
occurs in a volume localised in the close vicinity of the contact lines for a
drop on a fibre. Thus, the fibre geometry induces a weaker accumulation of
particles at the contact line compared to a sessile drop, leading to the more
homogeneous deposit observed experimentally.

limitation by placing a transferable porous gold membrane (PAuM) on top of the
surface of interest. Slot-like nanopores in the membrane act as plasmonic slot
antennas and enhance the Raman response of the surface or thin film underneath.
Simultaneously, the PAuM suppresses the penetration of the excitation laser
into the bulk, efficiently blocking the bulk Raman signal. Using graphene as a
model surface, we show that these two simultaneous effects lead to an increase
in the surface-to-bulk Raman signal ratio by three orders of magnitude. We find
that 90% of the Raman enhancement occurs within the top 2.5 of the material,
demonstrating truly surface-sensitive Raman scattering. To validate our
approach, we analyze the surface of a LaNiO3 thin film. We observe a Raman mode
splitting for the LaNiO3 surface-layer, which is spectroscopic evidence that
the surface structure differs from the bulk. This result underpins that PAuM
give direct access to Raman signatures of surfaces and their structural

circular orbit around a helium white dwarf (HeWD) companion. This pulsar is
located 6.3 arcmin away from the centre of the globular cluster NGC6752. Given
the large offset, the association of the pulsar to NGC6752 has been debated. We
have made use of two decades of archival Parkes 64-m ""Murriyang"" telescope data
and recently carried out observations with the MeerKAT telescope. We obtained
Pulse times of arrival using standard data reduction techniques and analysed
using Bayesian pulsar timing techniques. We analysed the pulsar's total
intensity and polarisation profile, to study the interstellar scattering along
the line of sight, and the pulsar's geometry by applying the rotating vector
model. We obtain precise measurements of several post-Keplerian parameters: the
range $r=0.202(6)T_\odot$ and shape s=0.999823(4) of the Shapiro delay, from
which we infer the orbital inclination to be $88.9^{+0.15}_{-0.14}\deg$ and the
masses of both the pulsar and the companion to be $1.55(7)M_{\odot}$ and
$0.202(6)M_{\odot}$ respectively; a secular change in the orbital period
$\dot{P}_{\rm b}=-53^{+7.4}_{-6.0}\times 10^{-15}$\,s\,s$^{-1}$ that proves the
association to NGGC6752 and a secular change in the projected semi-major axis
of the pulsar $\dot{x}= -40.7^{+7.3}_{-8.2}\times10^{-16}$\,s\,s$^{-1}$ that is
likely caused by the spin-orbit interaction from a misaligned HeWD spin, at
odds with the likely isolated binary evolution of the system. We also discuss
some theoretical models for the structure and evolution of WDs in NS-WD
binaries by using J1910A's companion as a test bed. J1910A is a rare system for
which several parameters of both the pulsar and the HeWD companion can be
accurately measured. As such, it is a test bed to discriminate between
alternative models for HeWD structure and cooling.

of the supernova ejecta and forms a thin massive shell. Later on, when the
shell has been reached by the reverse shock of the supernova remnant, the
evolution becomes more complex, in most cases reverting the expansion into a
compression: this later phase is called ""reverberation"". Computations done so
far to understand this phase have been mostly performed in the thin-shell
approximation, where the evolution of the PWN radius is assimilated to that of
the swept-up shell under the effect of both the inner pressure from the PWN,
and the outer pressure from the supernova remnant. Despite the thin-shell
approach seems rather justifiable, its implementations have so far been
inaccurate, and its correctness, never tested. The outer pressure was naively
assumed to be scaled according to the Sedov solution (or a constant fraction of
it) along the entire evolution. The thin-shell assumption itself fails along
the process, being the shell no longer thin in comparison with the size of the
PWN. Here, through a combination of numerical models, dimensional arguments,
and analytic approximations, we present a detailed analysis of the interaction
of the PWN with the supernova remnant. We provide a new analytic approximation
of the outer pressure, beyond the Sedov solution, and a revised ""thin-shell""
able to reproduce results from numerical simulations. Finally, we compute the
efficiency by which the PWN is compressed during reverberation over a wide
population of sources.

algorithm that explicitly computes, within the proof assistant, vertex-edge
graphs of polytopes as well as their diameter. The originality of this
certificate-based algorithm is to achieve a tradeoff between simplicity and
efficiency.
  Simplicity is crucial in obtaining the proof of correctness of the algorithm.
This proof splits into the correctness of an abstract algorithm stated over
proof-oriented data types and the correspondence with a low-level
implementation over computation-oriented data types. A special effort has been
made to reduce the algorithm to a small sequence of elementary operations
(e.g., matrix multiplications, basic routines on sets and graphs), in order to
make the derivation of the correctness of the low-level implementation more
transparent.
  Efficiency allows us to scale up to polytopes with a challenging
combinatorics. For instance, we formally check the two counterexamples of
Matschke, Santos and Weibel to the Hirsch conjecture, respectively 20- and
23-dimensional polytopes with 36 425 and 73 224 vertices involving rational
coefficients with up to 40 digits in their numerator and denominator. We also
illustrate the performance of the method by computing the list of vertices or
the diameter of well-known classes of polytopes, such as (polars of) cyclic

blood sample. Knowing the ACF of a cancer cell represents a crucial step in the
design of acoustophoretic systems for this purpose, potentially allowing the
isolation of circulating cancer cells without labels or contact. For biological
cells the static compressibility is different from the high frequency
counterpart relevant for the ACF. In this study, we started by characterizing
the ACF of low vs. high metastatic cell lines with known associated differences
in phenotypic static E-modulus. The change in the static E-modulus, however,
was not reflected in a change of the ACF, prompting a more in depth analysis of
the influences on the ACF. We demonstrate that static E-modulus increased
biological cells through formaldehyde fixation have an increased ACF.
Conversely static E-modulus decreased biological cells treated with actin
polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D have a decreased ACF. Complementing
these mechanical tests, a numerical COMSOL model was implemented and used to
parametrically explore the effects of cell density, cell density ratios,
dynamic compressibility and therefore the dynamic bulk modulus. Collectively
the combined laboratory and numerical experiments reveal that a change in the
static E-modulus alone might, but does not automatically lead to a change of
the dynamic ACF for biological cells. This highlights the need for a

been previously analysed in this way. In some cases, the updated planetary
parameters differ significantly from previous studies, resulting in a deeper
radius valley than previously observed. This suggests that planets are likely
to have a more homogeneous core composition at formation. Furthermore, using
support-vector machines, we find that the radius valley location strongly
depends on orbital period and stellar mass and weakly depends on stellar age,
with $\partial \log {\left(R_{p, \text{valley}} \right)}/ \partial \log{P} =

  process","PhD thesis",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech math-ph math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Exclusion processes in one dimension first appeared in the 70s and have since
dragged much attention from communities in different domains: stochastic
processes, out-of-equilibriums statistical physics, and more recently
integrable systems. While the state of the art for a single species totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) can be described, from different
aspects as mature, much less is known when multiple interacting species are
present. Using tools from integrable systems and hydrodynamics in the first
place and stochastic processes in the second place, this work attempts to study
the behavior of a novel version of the model with different species of
particles having hierarchical dynamics that depend on arbitrary parameters.
While Burger's equation famously represents the hydrodynamic limit of TASEP
with a single species, we present a counterpart coupled system of PDE
representing the hydrodynamic limit for a model with two species. The solutions
of these PDEs display a rich phenomenology of solutions best characterized
through the underlying normal modes. This system with two species can be used
as a toy model for studying driven diffusive systems with open boundaries.
Using heuristics, we present results suggesting a general principle governing
the boundary-induced phase diagram of systems with multiple coupled driven
conserved quantities, generalizing thus the extremal current principle known
for the case of a single driven quantity. Using integrability tools, we develop
a formalism allowing the computation of the finite-time probability
distribution of particle positions on the 1D lattice, generalizing therefore
known results for TASEP and other multi-species models. We finally study the
behavior and the impact of a single second-class impurity initially located at
the interface separating two regions of different densities of first-class
particles.

Thousand-Pulsar-Array programme on MeerKAT. About 35% of the analysed pulsars
exhibit drifting subpulses which are more pronounced towards the deathline,
consistent with previous studies. We estimate that this common phenomenon is
detectable in 60% of the overall pulsar population if high quality data were
available for all. This large study reveals the evolution of drifting subpulses
across the pulsar population in unprecedented detail. In particular, we find
that the modulation period $P_3$ follows a V-shaped evolution with respect to
the characteristic age $\tau_c$, such that the smallest $P_3$ values,
corresponding to the Nyquist period $P_3>\sim2$, are found at
$\tau_c>\sim10^{7.5}$ yr. The V-shaped evolution can be interpreted and
reproduced if young pulsars possess aliased fast intrinsic $P_3$, which
monotonically increase, ultimately achieving a slow unaliased $P_3$.
Enhancement of irregularities in intrinsic subpulse modulation by aliasing in
small $\tau_c$ pulsars would explain their observed less well defined $P_3$'s
and weaker spectral features. Modelling these results as rotating subbeams,
their circulation must slow down as the pulsar evolves. This is the opposite to
that expected if circulation is driven by ExB drift. This can be resolved if
the observed $P_3$ periodicity is due to a beat between an ExB system and the
pulsar period. As a by-product, we identify the correct periods and spin-down
rates for 12 pulsars, for which harmonically related values were reported in
the literature.

of its peak position, smearing width, and functional form. If the unsmeared
spectral density is sufficiently smooth in the neighborhood of a particular
energy, it can be obtained from an extrapolation to zero smearing-kernel width
at fixed peak position. A natural application for this approach is scattering
processes summed over all hadronic final states. As a proof-of-principle test,
an inclusive rate is computed in the two-dimensional O(3) sigma model from a
two-point correlation function of conserved currents. The results at finite and

ensembles by strong coupling of molecular vibrations to quantized cavity modes.
In quantum mechanical treatments of such scenarios, frequently idealized models
with single molecules and scaled, effective molecule-cavity interactions or
alternatively ensemble models with simplified model Hamiltonians are used. In
this work, we go beyond these models by applying an ensemble variant of the
Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian for vibro-polaritonic chemistry and numerically solve
the underlying time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation to study the
cavity-induced quantum dynamics in an ensemble of thioacetylacetone (TAA)
molecules undergoing hydrogen transfer under vibrational strong coupling (VSC)
conditions. Beginning with a single molecule coupled to a single cavity mode,
we show that the cavity indeed enforces hydrogen transfer from an enol to an
enethiol configuration with transfer rates significantly increasing with
light-matter interaction strength. This positive effect of the cavity on
reaction rates is different from several other systems studied so far, where a
retarding effect of the cavity on rates was found. It is argued that the cavity
``catalyzes'' the reaction by transfer of virtual photons to the molecule. The
same concept applies to ensembles with up to $N=20$ TAA molecules coupled to a
single cavity mode, where an additional, significant, ensemble-induced
collective isomerization rate enhancement is found. The latter is traced back
to complex entanglement dynamics of the ensemble, which we quantify by means of
von Neumann-entropies. A non-trivial dependence of the dynamics on ensemble
size is found, clearly beyond scaled single-molecule models, which we interpret
as transition from a multi-mode Rabi to a system-bath-type regime as $N$
increases.

relatively small time step is required to propagate the much faster electronic
dynamics, thereby prohibiting the simulation of long-time nuclear quantum
dynamics. Herein, the electronic Born--Oppenheimer (BO) approximation within
the NEO framework is presented. In this approach, the electronic density is
quenched to the ground state at each time step, and the real-time nuclear
quantum dynamics is propagated on an instantaneous electronic ground state
defined by both the classical nuclear geometry and the nonequilibrium quantum
nuclear density. Because the electronic dynamics is no longer propagated, this
approximation enables the use of an order-of-magnitude larger time step, thus
greatly reducing the computational cost. Moreover, invoking the electronic BO
approximation also fixes the unphysical asymmetric Rabi splitting observed in
previous semiclassical RT-NEO-TDDFT simulations of vibrational polaritons even
for small Rabi splitting, instead yielding a stable, symmetric Rabi splitting.
For intramolecular proton transfer in malonaldehyde, both RT-NEO-Ehrenfest

employ a regularization term to the projections. Finally, an iterative

that the best regularized solution by {hyb-TCGME} is as accurate as that by

modulation with the period of 59.45\pm0.04 days found earlier, and also found
an additional weak modulation with a longer period (840\pm21 days). After a
series of analyses, we incline to the view that the mechanisms leading the two

a potential negative correlation between the modulation amplitude (or upper

metal-rich will promote the convection in the outer stellar atmosphere, and
then inhibit those factors (turbulence, shock wave, etc.) that may cause
Blazhko modulation. Future observations and research work can be carried out

in the estimation of the source redshift distribution (SRD) in each of the

sensitivity of the final observables, e.g. the lensing angular power spectrum,
with respect to the SRD at a specific redshift. This allows the propagation of
arbitrarily shaped small perturbations to the SRD, without having to run the
whole analysis pipeline for each realization again. We apply our method to a
EUCLID survey and demonstrate it with SRDs of the KV450 data set, recovering
previous results. Lastly, we note that for cosmic shear moments of order larger
than two will probably be not relevant when propagating redshift uncertainties.

study of Mg II probing a large dynamic range of galaxy properties, using newly
obtained high signal-to-noise, moderate-resolution spectra of Mg II for a
sample of 34 galaxies selected from the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey. We
show that the galaxies in our sample have Mg II profiles ranging from strong
emission to P-Cygni profiles, and to pure absorption. We find there is a
significant trend (with a possibility of spurious correlations of ~ 2%) that
galaxies detected as strong LyC Emitters (LCEs) also show larger equivalent
widths of Mg II emission, and non-LCEs tend to show evidence of more scattering
and absorption features in Mg II We then find Mg II strongly correlates with
Ly-alpha in both equivalent width and escape fraction, regardless of whether
the emission or absorption dominates the Mg II profiles. Furthermore, we
present that, for galaxies categorized as Mg II emitters (MgE), one can adopt
the information of Mg II, metallicity, and dust to estimate the escape fraction
of LyC within a factor of 3. These findings confirm that Mg II lines can be
used as a tool to select galaxies as LCEs and to serve as an indirect indicator

explain this observation by numerical simulations carried out to calculate the

demonstrative of an effective restoring force for photophoretic trapping even

robustness of such networks has heretofore not been explored. This is
particularly relevant given the broad social implications of such technologies
and the fact that biologically small perturbations in the protein sequence do
not generally lead to drastic changes in the protein structure. In this paper,
we demonstrate that AlphaFold does not exhibit such robustness despite its high
accuracy. This raises the challenge of detecting and quantifying the extent to
which these predicted protein structures can be trusted. To measure the
robustness of the predicted structures, we utilize (i) the root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) and (ii) the Global Distance Test (GDT) similarity measure
between the predicted structure of the original sequence and the structure of
its adversarially perturbed version. We prove that the problem of minimally
perturbing protein sequences to fool protein folding neural networks is
NP-complete. Based on the well-established BLOSUM62 sequence alignment scoring
matrix, we generate adversarial protein sequences and show that the RMSD
between the predicted protein structure and the structure of the original

units in the BLOSUM62 distance, and (ii) five residues (out of hundreds or

compute theoretically for large numbers of atoms $N$, which often prevents
direct comparison with experimental data. Here we report significant progress
on this problem for the 1D Tonks-Girardeau gas in the asymptotic limit of large
$N$, at zero temperature and driven out of equilibrium by a quench of the
confining potential. We find an exact formula for the time-dependent
one-particle density matrix $\langle \hat{\Psi}^\dagger(x) \hat{\Psi}(x')

valid on distances $|x-x'| $ much larger than the interparticle distance. By
comparing with numerical results for $N=33$ atoms, we demonstrate that the new
asymptotically exact formula can be used to compute the out-of-equilibrium MD
with great accuracy for a wide range of momenta (except in the tails of the
distribution at very large momenta). For a quench from a double-well potential

elucidate differences in shallow and deep flows past porous substrate, foams
with two different thickness (h) are used (for all three substrates). A wide
range of Friction Reynolds number (2000< Retau < 15000) and Permeability based
Reynolds number (1<ReK< 50) are attained. For substrates with ReK=1, the flow
behaviour remains similar to flow over impermeable smooth walls and as such
Townsend's hypothesis remains valid. In contrast, a substantial reduction in
velocity disturbances and associated length scales is achieved for permeable
(ReK>1) and dense (relative to viscous scales) foam at the thick substrate
limit (h/s>10), which leads to the breakdown of outer-layer similarity. As
porosity is increased, a thin substrate limit is reached (h/s), and the foam
becomes sparse relative to viscous scales (s+ > 100). For such foams, the flow
conforms to outer-layer similarity and is more akin to flow over rough
surfaces. Such substrates are unable to attenuate velocity disturbances and the
dependence of substrate thickness (h/s) on spectral energy content of turbulent
fluctuations ceases to exist. The present study shows that transition from
thick to thin substrate flow behavior depends not only on thickness-to-pore
ratio (h/s) but also on substrate density relative to viscous scales of the

meteorite parent body aqueous alteration of interstellar residue analogs. The
distributions of amines and amino acids are qualitatively and quantitatively
investigated and linked to closing the gap between interstellar and meteoritic
prebiotic organic abundances. We find that the abundance trend of methylamine >
ethylamine> glycine > serine > alanine > \b{eta}-alanine does not change from
pre- to post-aqueous alteration, suggesting that certain cloud conditions have
an influential role on the distributions of interstellar-inherited meteoritic

studied here varied by about 2-fold when aqueously processed for 7 days at 125

consistent with those of aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites, pointing to
an influential role of meteorite parent body processing on the distributions of

{\alpha}- over \b{eta}-alanine, which is opposite to what is typically observed
in aqueously altered carbonaceous chondrites; these results may be explained by
at least the lack of minerals and insoluble organic matter-relevant materials
in the experiments. The high abundance of volatile amines in the non-aqueously
altered samples suggests that these types of interstellar volatiles can be
efficiently transferred to asteroids and comets, supporting the idea of the
presence of interstellar organics in solar system objects.

behaviors from time-ordered data, with applications in many disciplines such as
physics, biology, finance, and engineering. Measured time-series data, however,
are often low dimensional or even univariate, thus requiring embedding methods
to reconstruct the original system's state space. The observability of a system
establishes fundamental conditions under which such reconstruction is possible.
However, complete observability is too restrictive in applications where
reconstructing the entire state space is not necessary and only a specific
subspace is relevant. Here, we establish the theoretic condition to reconstruct
a nonlinear functional of state variables from measurement processes,
generalizing the concept of functional observability to nonlinear systems. When
the functional observability condition holds, we show how to construct a map
from the embedding space to the desired functional of state variables,
characterizing the quality of such reconstruction. The theoretical results are
then illustrated numerically using chaotic systems with contrasting
observability properties. By exploring the presence of functionally
unobservable regions in embedded attractors, we also apply our theory for the
early warning of seizure-like events in simulated and empirical data. The
studies demonstrate that the proposed functional observability condition can be
assessed a priori to guide time-series analysis and experimental design for the
dynamical characterization of complex systems.

into precision of matching. In a model assuming Gaussian covariates and making
best-case assumptions about matching quality, it sharply characterizes average
and worst-case discrepancies between paired differences of true versus
estimated index values. In this optimistic setting, worst-case true and
estimated index differences decline to zero if $p=o[n/(\log n)]$, the same
restriction on model size that is needed for consistency of common index
models. This remains so as the Gaussian assumption is relaxed to sub-gaussian,
if in that case the characterization of paired index errors is less sharp. The
formula derived under Gaussian assumptions is used as the basis for a matching
caliper. Matching such that paired differences on the estimated index fall
below this caliper brings the benefit that after matching, worst-case
differences onan underlying index tend to 0 if $p = o\{[n/(\log n)]^{2/3}\}$.
(With a linear index model, $p=o[n/(\log n)]$ suffices.) A proposed refinement
of the caliper condition brings the same benefits without the sub-gaussian
condition on covariates. When strong ignorability holds and the index is a
well-specified propensity or prognostic score, ensuring in this way that
worst-case matched discrepancies on it tend to 0 with increasing $n$ also
ensures the consistency of matched estimators of the treatment effect.

progress in the last twenty years, lattice spin glasses have remained largely
intractable. This article presents the solutions to a number of questions about
the Edwards-Anderson model of short-range spin glasses (in all dimensions) that
were raised in the physics literature many years ago. First, it is shown that
the ground state is sensitive to small perturbations of the disorder, in the
sense that a small amount of noise gives rise to a new ground state that is
nearly orthogonal to the old one with respect to the site overlap inner
product. Second, it is shown that one can overturn a macroscopic fraction of
the spins in the ground state with an energy cost that is negligible compared
to the size of the boundary of the overturned region - a feature that is
believed to be typical of spin glasses but clearly absent in ferromagnets. The
third result is that the boundary of the overturned region in dimension $d$ has
fractal dimension strictly greater than $d-1$, confirming a prediction from
physics. The fourth result is that the correlations between bonds in the ground
state can decay at most like the inverse of the distance. This contrasts with
the random field Ising model, where it has been shown recently that the
correlation decays exponentially in distance in dimension two. The fifth result
is that the expected size of the critical droplet of a bond grows at least like
a power of the volume. Taken together, these results comprise the first
mathematical proof of glassy behavior in a short-range spin glass model.

two ways: One approach is based on manual load shedding, with system operators
requesting loads to be shed ahead of anticipated stressful operating
conditions. Manual load shedding is usually done through phone calls. The
second method is automatic load shedding via underfrequency relays. Using
static settings, these schemes can be designed to operate in stages and drop
previously identified loads. The main limitation of traditional load shedding
schemes is that they are reactive and leave little room for optimized
corrective actions. This work presents a proactive and automatic underfrequency
load shedding solution for power systems. Measurements are captured via phasor
measurement units (PMUs) at relatively low sampling rates of 30 Hz. These
measurements are then processed by particle filters who predict the future
state of the system's frequency. Based on these predictions excess load is
determined and shed. Comparative case studies are performed in simulated
environments. Easy-to-implement models, without hard-to-derive parameters,
highlight potential aspects for real-life implementation.

HPCLS, is introduced, that uses PCA and inter-prediction for spectral and VVC

clustering on Lyman-$\alpha$ luminosity. We use 1030 LAEs from the MUSE-Wide
survey, 679 LAEs from MUSE-Deep, and 367 LAEs from the to-date deepest ever
spectroscopic survey, the MUSE Extremely Deep Field. All objects have
spectroscopic redshifts of $3<z<6$ and cover a large dynamic range of
Ly$\alpha$ luminosities: $40.15<\log (L_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}/[\rm{erg
\:s}^{-1}])<43.35$. We apply the Adelberger et al. K-estimator as the
clustering statistic and fit the measurements with state-of-the-art halo
occupation distribution (HOD) models. From the three main data sets, we find
that the large-scale bias factor, the minimum mass to host one central LAE,
$M_{\rm{min}}$, and (on average) one satellite LAE, $M_1$, increase weakly with
an increasing line luminosity. The satellite fractions are $\lesssim10$%
($\lesssim20$%) at $1\sigma$ ($3\sigma$) confidence level, supporting a
scenario in which DMHs typically host one single LAE. We next bisected the
three main samples into disjoint subsets to thoroughly explore the dependence
of the clustering properties on $L_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$. We report a strong
($8\sigma$) clustering dependence on $L_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}$, where the highest
luminosity LAE subsample ($\log(L_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}/[\rm{erg
\:s}^{-1}])\approx42.53$) clusters more strongly
($b_{\rm{high}}=3.13^{+0.08}_{-0.15}$) and resides in more massive DMHs
($\log(M_{\rm{h}}/[h^{-1}\rm{M}_{\odot}])=11.43^{+0.04}_{-0.10}$) than the
lowest luminosity one ($\log(L_{\rm{Ly}\alpha}/[\rm{erg
\:s}^{-1}])\approx40.97$), which presents a bias of
$b_{\rm{low}}=1.79^{+0.08}_{-0.06}$ and occupies
$\log(M_{\rm{h}}/[h^{-1}\rm{M}_{\odot}])=10.00^{+0.12}_{-0.09}$ halos. We
discuss the implications of these results for evolving Ly$\alpha$ luminosity
functions, halo mass dependent Ly$\alpha$ escape fractions, and incomplete
reionization signatures.

instead of commodifying it. The flaring magnitudes are large in some states,
which constitute problems with energy waste and CO2 emissions. In North Dakota,
operators are required to estimate and report the volume flared. The questions
are, how good is the quality of this reporting, and what insights can be drawn
from it? Apart from the company-reported statistics, which are available from
the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC), flared volumes can be estimated
via satellite remote sensing, serving as an unbiased benchmark. Since
interpretation of the Landsat 8 imagery is hindered by artifacts due to glow,
the estimated volumes based on the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
(VIIRS) are used. Reverse geocoding is performed for comparing and contrasting
the NDIC and VIIRS data at different levels, such as county and oilfield. With
all the data gathered and preprocessed, Bayesian learning implemented by MCMC
methods is performed to address three problems: county level model development,
flaring time series analytics, and distribution estimation. First, there is
heterogeneity among the different counties, in the associations between the
NDIC and VIIRS volumes. In light of such, models are developed for each county
by exploiting hierarchical models. Second, the flaring time series, albeit
noisy, contains information regarding trends and patterns, which provide some
insights into operator approaches. Gaussian processes are found to be effective
in many different pattern recognition scenarios. Third, distributional insights
are obtained through unsupervised learning. The negative binomial and GMMs are
found to effectively describe the oilfield flare count and flared volume
distributions, respectively. Finally, a nearest-neighbor-based approach for
operator level monitoring and analytics is introduced.

superimposed potentials, we can reach, in principle, arbitrarily large atom
separations, while requiring only a relatively small numerical aperture.
Numerical simulations of our `accordion superlattice' show that the atoms
remain localised to one lattice site throughout the separation process, even
for moderate lattice depths. In a proof-of-principle experiment we demonstrate
the optical fields required for the accordion superlattice using acousto-optic
deflectors. The method can be applied to neutral-atom quantum computing with
optical tweezers, as well as quantum simulation of low-entropy many-body
states. For instance, a unit-filling atomic Mott insulator can be coherently
expanded by a factor of ten in order to load an optical tweezer array with very
high filling. In turn, sorted tweezer arrays can be compressed to form
high-density states of ultracold atoms in optical lattices. The method can be
also be applied to biological systems where dynamical separation of particles

supermassive black holes (BHs), due to the influence of AGN feedback.
Correlations within simulated galaxy populations suggest that the masses of BHs
are governed by properties of their host dark matter haloes, such as the
binding energy and assembly time, at a given halo mass. However, the full
picture must be more complex as galaxy mergers have also been shown to
influence the growth of BHs and the impact of AGN. In this study, we
investigate this problem by using the genetic modification technique to adjust
the assembly history of a Milky Way-like galaxy simulated with the EAGLE model.
We change the halo assembly time (and hence the binding energy) in the absence
of any disruptive merger events, and find little change in the integrated
growth of the BH. We attribute this to the angular momentum support provided by
a galaxy disc, which reduces the inflow of gas towards the BH and effectively
decouples the BH's growth from the properties of the halo. Introducing major
mergers into the assembly history disrupts the disc, causing the BH to grow
$\approx 4\times$ more massive and inject feedback that reduces the halo baryon
fraction by a factor of $\approx 2$ and quenches star formation. Merger events
appear to be essential to the diversity in BH masses in EAGLE, and we show that
they can also significantly increase the halo binding energy, potentially
explaining the correlation between these quantities.

GCs based on high-precision proper motions computed with Hubble Space Telescope

clearer, and measured the velocity dispersion of stars belonging to first (1G)

isotropic even at the half-light radius, whereas 2G stars are isotropic at the
center and become radially anisotropic before the half-light radius. The radial
anisotropy is induced by a lower tangential velocity dispersion of 2G stars
with respect to the 1G population, while the radial component of the motion is
comparable. We also show possible evidence that the kinematic properties of
mPOPs are affected by the Galactic tidal field, corroborating previous
observational and theoretical results suggesting a relation between the
strength of the external tidal field and some properties of mPOPs. Although

some moderately star-forming galaxies at the epoch of re-ionization (EoR). The
origin of this `$\rm [C_{II}]$ deficit' is unclear. In this work, we study the

with $M_*\approx10^7-5\times10^{11}\,M_\odot$ extracted from cosmological
volume and zoom-in simulations from the Feedback in Realistic Environments

of galaxies in terms of the following parameters: mass fraction of $\rm

gas density ($n_{\rm gas}$) and gas depletion time ($t_{\rm dep}{}={}M_{\rm

($Z_{\rm gas}$) is the main driver of the $\rm [C_{II}]$ deficit in $\rm
H_2$-rich ($\rm H_2$-poor) galaxies. The observed $\rm [C_{II}]$ deficit of
IR-luminous galaxies and early EoR galaxies, corresponding to the two different
regimes, is due to short gas depletion time and low gas metallicity,
respectively. Our result indicates that $\rm [C_{II}]$ deficit is a common
phenomenon of galaxies, and caution needs to be taken when applying a constant
$L_{\rm [C_{II}]}$-to-SFR conversion factor derived from local SFGs to estimate
cosmic SFR density at high redshifts and interpret data from upcoming $\rm

its action cannot be simulated efficiently on classical computers. Practically,
it is highly likely that only a limited number of $T$ gates are available in
the near future due to its experimental difficulty of fault-tolerant

Clifford+$T$ decomposition with a limited budget of $T$ gates and propose a new
model of the error of such decomposition. More concretely, we propose an
algorithm to generate the most accurate Clifford+$T$-gate decomposition of a

propose to model the error of Clifford+$T$ decomposition using well-known
depolarizing noise by considering the average of the effects of the error. We
numerically verified our model successfully explains the decomposition error

density of high energy states, in analogy with the behavior of holographic
CFTs. For the single-trace $T\bar T$ deformation, we show that modular
invariance implies that the torus partition function can be written in terms of
the untwisted partition function and its modular images, the latter of which
can be obtained from the action of a generalized Hecke operator. The partition
function and the energy of twisted states match holographic calculations in
previous literature, thus providing further evidence for the conjectured
holographic correspondence. In addition, we show that the single-trace

via second order Fermi acceleration, how this energy transfer affects the
turbulent cascade remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that damping and
steepening of the compressive turbulent power spectrum are expected once the
damping time $t_{\rm damp} \sim \rho v^{2}/\dot{E}_{\rm CR} \propto E_{\rm
CR}^{-1}$ becomes comparable to the turbulent cascade time. Magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations of stirred compressive turbulence in a gas-CR fluid with
diffusive CR transport show clear imprints of CR-induced damping, saturating at
$\dot{E}_{\rm CR} \sim \tilde{\epsilon}$, where $\tilde{\epsilon}$ is the
turbulent energy input rate. In that case, almost all the energy in large scale
motions is absorbed by CRs and does not cascade down to grid scale. This
``divergence-cleaning"" should render small-scale turbulence largely solenoidal
and could suppress fluctuations important for thermal instability. The lack of
small-scale compressive modes is also problematic for hypothesized resonant
scattering of $E > 300$ GeV CRs, when self-confinement is inefficient. When CR
transport is streaming dominated, CRs also damp large scale motions, with
kinetic energy reduced by up to to an order of magnitude in realistic $E_{\rm
CR} \sim E_{\rm g}$ scenarios, but turbulence (with a reduced amplitude) still
cascades down to small scales with the same power spectrum. Such large scale
damping implies that turbulent velocities obtained from the observed velocity
dispersion may significantly underestimate the turbulent forcing rate, i.e.
$\tilde{\epsilon} \gg \rho v^{3}/L$. These findings motivate future, higher

the luminosity of horizontal branch (HB) stars identified in Hubble Space
Telescope optical imaging. The galaxy has a half-light radius (r_h) of 100
(+11/-13) pc, M_V = -7.20 (+0.17/-0.16) mag, and a present-day stellar mass of
6.5 (+1.1/-1.4) x 10^4 Msun. We identify sources in the color-magnitude diagram
(CMD) that may be younger than ~500 Myr suggesting late-time star formation in
the UFD galaxy, although further study is needed to confirm these are bona fide
young stars in the galaxy. Based on fitting the CMD with stellar evolution
libraries, Pegasus W shows an extended star formation history (SFH). Using the
tau_90 metric (defined as the timescale by which the galaxy formed 90% of its
stellar mass), the galaxy was quenched only 7.4 (+2.2/-2.6) Gyr ago, which is
similar to the quenching timescale of a number of UFD satellites of M31 but
significantly more recent than the UFD satellites of the Milky Way. Such
late-time quenching is inconsistent with the more rapid timescale expected by
reionization and suggests that, while not currently a satellite of M31, Pegasus
W was nonetheless slowly quenched by environmental processes.

While being largely invisible at $\sim$1 $\mu$m with NIRCam, except for sparse
clumpy sub-structures, the object is well-detected and resolved in the
long-wavelength bands with a spiral shape clearly visible in F277W. By
combining ancillary ALMA and $Herschel$ data, we infer that this object is an
edge-on dusty spiral with an intrinsic stellar mass log$(M_*/M_\odot)\sim11.3$

(log$(M_*/M_\odot)\sim10.8$) with tidal features lies 2\farcs{0} away
($r$$\sim$9 kpc), at a consistent redshift as inferred by $JWST$ photometry,
indicating a potential major merger. The dusty spiral lies on the main-sequence
of star formation, and shows high dust attenuation in the optical ($3<A_{\rm
V}<4.5$). In the far-infrared, its integrated dust SED is optically thick up to
$\lambda_0 \sim 500$ $\mu$m, further supporting the extremely dusty nature.
Spatially resolved analysis of the $HST$-dark galaxy reveals a largely uniform
$A_{\rm V}\sim 4$ area spanning $\sim$57 kpc$^2$, which spatially matches to
the ALMA 1 mm continuum emission. Accounting for the surface brightness dimming

galaxies, but many of their properties are not well-constrained. Gamma-ray
observations provide a powerful tool in this respect, allowing us to constrain
both the interaction of CR protons with the ISM and their transport properties.
To help better understand the link between observational signatures and CR
physics, we use a series of magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) AREPO simulations of
isolated galaxies performed using spectrally-resolved CR transport in every
computational cell, with subsequent gamma-ray emission calculated using the
CRAYON+ (Cosmic RAY emissiON) code. In each of our simulated halos, modelling
the energy-dependent spatial diffusion of CRs leads to a more extended
distribution of high-energy (~100 GeV) gamma rays compared to that predicted by
a 'grey' steady-state model, which is especially visible in the corresponding
emission maps and radial profiles. Despite this, the total gamma-ray spectra
can often be well approximated by the steady-state model, although recovering
the same spectral index typically requires a minor variation of the energy
dependence of the diffusion coefficient. Our simulations reproduce the observed
spectral indices and gamma-ray spectra of nearby star-forming galaxies and also
match recent observations of the far infrared--gamma-ray relation. We find,
however, that the spectrally resolved model yields marginally smaller
luminosities for lower star formation rates compared to grey simulations of
CRs. Our work highlights the importance of modelling spectrally resolved CR
transport for an accurate prediction of spatially resolved high-energy
gamma-ray emission, as will be probed by the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array

widely accepted to be produced by a superposition of a large number of
unresolved X-ray point sources. In the very central degrees of our Galaxy,
however, the existence of an extremely hot ($\sim$7 keV) diffuse plasma is
still under debate. In this work we measure the Fe XXV line emission using all
available XMM-Newton observations of the Galactic centre (GC) and inner disc
($-10^{\circ}$$<\ell<10^{\circ}$, $-2^{\circ}<b<2^{\circ}$). We use recent
stellar mass distribution models to estimate the amount of X-ray emission
originating from unresolved point sources, and find that within a region of
$\ell=\pm1^{\circ}$ and $b=\pm0.25^\circ$ the 6.7 keV emission is 1.3 to 1.5
times in excess of what is expected from unresolved point sources. The excess
emission is enhanced towards regions where known supernova remnants are
located, suggesting that at least a part of this emission is due to genuine
diffuse very hot plasma. If the entire excess is due to very hot plasma, an
energy injection rate of at least $\sim6\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is
required, which cannot be provided by the measured supernova explosion rate or
past Sgr A$^{*}$ activity alone. However, we find that almost the entire excess
we observe can be explained by assuming GC stellar populations with iron
abundances $\sim$1.9 times higher than those in the bar/bulge, a value that can
be reproduced by fitting diffuse X-ray spectra from the corresponding regions.
Even in this case, a leftover X-ray excess is concentrated within
$\ell=\pm0.3^{\circ}$ and $b=\pm0.15^\circ$, corresponding to a thermal energy
of $\sim2\times10^{52}$ erg, which can be reproduced by the estimated supernova
explosion rate in the GC. Finally we discuss a possible connection to the
observed GC Fermi-LAT excess.

GCs generally contain a `primordial' population with abundances similar to
field stars, along with an `enriched' population exhibiting light element
anomalies. In this paper we present a homogeneous and wide-view analysis of
multiple stellar populations in 28 Galactic GCs. By using a combination of HST
photometry together with wide-field, ground-based photometry we are able to
analyse between 84% and 99% of all stars in each cluster. For each GC, we
classify stars into separate sub-populations using the well-established
$C_{\rm{UBI}}$ colour index, and investigate the spatial distributions of these
populations. Our results show that dynamically young GCs can contain either
centrally concentrated enriched or primordial populations, or no centrally
concentrated population. Dynamically old GCs show fully mixed populations as
expected. The existence of clusters born with centrally concentrated primordial
(and homogeneously mixed) populations exacerbates the mass-budget problem
facing many cluster formation scenarios. The diversity in these results also
highlights the need for additional theories that can account for the wide
variety of initial conditions that we find. We finally investigate the enriched
star fraction as a function of different global parameters in our GC sample,
using also data for young and low-mass clusters from the Small- and Large
Magellanic Clouds and confirm earlier results that the enriched star fraction
strongly correlates with the initial mass of a cluster.

driven evolution implementing the gates on the qubits. We show how to modify
the noiseless gate executed by the computer to include any Markovian noise,
hence resulting in what we will call a noisy gate. We compare our method with
the IBM Qiskit simulator, and show that it follows more closely both the
analytical solution of the Lindblad equation as well as the behaviour of a real
quantum computer, where we ran algorithms involving up to 18 qubits; thus, it
offers a more accurate simulator for NISQ devices. The method is flexible
enough to potentially describe any noise, including non-Markovian ones. The
noise simulator based on this work is available as a python package at this

between observed high altitude aerosols and other system parameters. This could
be, in part, because of the lack of homogeneous exoplanet samples for which
specific parameters can be isolated and inspected. Here we present a set of
seven exoplanets with very similar system parameters. We analyze existing
photometric timeseries, Gaia parallax, and high-resolution spectroscopic data
to produce a new set of homogeneous stellar, planetary, and orbital parameters
for these systems. With this we confirm that most measured parameters for all
systems are very similar, except for the host stars' metallicities and possibly
high energy irradiation levels, which require UV and X-ray observations to
constrain. From the sample, WASP-6b, WASP-96b and WASP-110b, have observed
transmission spectra that we use to estimate their aerosol coverage levels
using the Na I doublet 5892.9{\AA}. We find a tentative correlation between the
metallicity of the host stars and the planetary aerosol levels. The trend we
find with stellar metallicity can be tested by observing transmission spectra
of the remaining planets in the sample. Based on our prediction, WASP-25b and
WASP-55b should have higher levels of aerosols than WASP-124b and HATS-29b.
Finally, we highlight how targeted surveys of alike planets like the ones
presented here might prove key for identifying driving factors for atmospheric
properties of exoplanets in the future and could be used as a sample selection
criterium for future observations with e.g. JWST, ARIEL, and the next
generation of ground-based telescopes.

for the equation $h_t + (h^3h_{xxx})_x = 0$, for which we have $h>0$ at the

considering the balance between processing and performance at the kilogram
scale. These trade-offs were necessitated by the inclusion of 0.1 wt. %
lithium-6 to enable detection of thermal neutrons. The synthesis and processing
of these plastic scintillators on the kilogram scale required consideration of
many factors. First, a comonomer (methacrylic acid) was used to solubilize
salts of lithium-6, which allow for a thermal-neutron capture reaction that
produces scintillation light following energy transfer. Second, scintillation
performance and processability were considered because the increasing content
of the comonomer resulted in a sharp decrease in the light output. The use of
small amounts of comonomer (less than or equal to 3 wt. %) resulted in better
performance but required high processing temperatures. At large scales, these
high temperatures could initiate an exothermic polymerization that results in
premature curing and/or defects. The deleterious effects of the comonomer may
be mitigated by using m-terphenyl as a primary dye rather than
2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO), which has been traditionally used in organic
scintillators. Finally, the curing environment was controlled to avoid defects
like cracking and discoloration while maintaining solubility of dopants during
curing. For scintillators that were produced from kilogram-scale batches of
precursors, the effective attenuation of scintillation light was characterized.

calibration solutions, by leveraging the RFI signal itself. We present TABASCAL
(TrAjectory BAsed RFI Subtraction and CALibration), a new algorithm that
jointly models the RFI signal & trajectory as well as the calibration
parameters in post-correlation visibilities. TABASCAL can use either
optimisation or fully Bayesian statistical methods to find calibration
solutions in contaminated data that would otherwise be thrown away. We test
TABASCAL on simulated MeerKAT calibration observations contaminated by
satellite-based RFI with amplitudes varying between -20 dB and 15 dB relative
to a 1 Jy source. We obtain gain estimates that are both unbiased and up to an
order of magnitude better constrained compared to the case of no RFI. TABASCAL
can be further applied to an adjacent target observation: using 5 minutes of
calibration data resulted in an image with about half the noise compared to
using purely flagged data, and only 23% higher than an uncontaminated
observation. The source detection threshold and recovered flux distribution of
TABASCAL-processed data was on par with uncontaminated data. In contrast, RFI
flagging alone resulted in consistent underestimation of source fluxes and less
sources detected. For a mean RFI amplitude of 17 Jy, using TABASCAL leads to
less than 1% loss of data compared to 75% data loss from ideal $3\sigma$
flagging, a significant increase in data available for science analysis.
Although we have examined the case of satellite RFI, TABASCAL should work for
any RFI moving on parameterizable trajectories, such as planes or objects fixed

of its broad wavelength coverage and improved resolution compared to previous

primordial hydrogen-dominated and cloudless pure methane atmospheres. Thus far,
the featureless transmission spectrum remains consistent with a planet that has
a high-altitude cloud deck (similar to Venus), a tenuous atmosphere (similar to
Mars), or no appreciable atmosphere at all (akin to Mercury). There are no
signs of stellar contamination due to spots or faculae. Our observations
demonstrate that JWST has the requisite sensitivity to constrain the secondary
atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets with absorption features <50 ppm, and
that our current atmospheric constraints speak to the nature of the planet

expansion rate $H_0$ and the matter fluctuation amplitude $S_8$ has become one
of the most intriguing puzzles in cosmology nowadays. The $H_0$ tension has
reached $4.2\sigma$ in the context of standard cosmology i.e $\Lambda$CDM.
Therefore, explanations to this issue are mandatory to unveil its secrets.
Despite its success, $\Lambda$CDM is unable to give a satisfying explanation to
the tension problem. Unless some systematic errors might be hidden in the
observable measurements, physics beyond the standard model of cosmology must be
advocated. In this perspective, we study a phantom dynamical dark energy model
as an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in order to explain the aforementioned
issues. This phantom model is characterised by one extra parameter,
$\Omega_{pdde}$, compared to $\Lambda$CDM. We obtain a strong positive
correlation between $H_0$ and $\Omega_{pdde}$, for all data combinations. Using
Planck measurements together with BAO and Pantheon, we find that the $H_0$ and
the $S_8$ tensions are $3\sigma$ and $2.6\sigma$, respectively. By introducing
a prior on the absolute magnitude, $M_B$, of the SN Ia, the $H_0$ tension
decreases to $2.27\sigma$ with $H_0 = 69.76_{-0.82}^{+0.75}$ km s$^{-1}$

units structure a knowledge graph into identifiable and semantically meaningful
subgraphs, each represented with its own resource that instantiates a
corresponding semantic unit class. Three categories of semantic units can be
distinguished: Statement units model individual propositions, compound units
are semantically meaningful collections of semantic units, and question units
model questions that translate into queries. I conclude with discussing how
semantic units provide a framework for the development of innovative user
interfaces that support exploring and accessing information in the graph by
reducing its complexity to what currently interests the user, thereby
significantly increasing the cognitive interoperability and thus
human-actionability of knowledge graphs.

remains a largely unexplored territory. In this work, we study the potential of
detecting these elusive objects from radial velocity monitoring of
self-luminous directly imaged planets. This technique is now possible thanks to
the development of dedicated instruments combining the power of high-resolution
spectroscopy and high-contrast imaging. First, we demonstrate a sensitivity to
satellites with a mass ratio of 1-4% at separations similar to the Galilean
moons from observations of a brown-dwarf companion (HR 7672 B; Kmag=13; 0.7""
separation) with the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC; R~35,000 in K
band) at the W. M. Keck Observatory. Current instrumentation is therefore
already sensitive to large unresolved satellites that could be forming from
gravitational instability akin to binary star formation. Using end-to-end
simulations, we then estimate that future instruments such as MODHIS, planned
for the Thirty Meter Telescope, should be sensitive to satellites with mass
ratios of ~1e-4. Such small moons would likely form in a circumplanetary disk
similar to the Jovian satellites in the solar system. Looking for the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect could also be an interesting pathway to detecting
the smallest moons on short orbital periods. Future exomoon discoveries will
allow precise mass measurements of the substellar companions that they orbit
and provide key insight into the formation of exoplanets. They would also help
constrain the population of habitable Earth-sized moons orbiting gas giants in
the habitable zone of their stars.

equipment. The drastically increasing demand for higher throughput in
integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing and inspection calls for the
next-generation precision stages that have light weight and high control
bandwidth simultaneously. In today's design techniques, the stage's first
flexible mode is limiting its achievable control bandwidth, which enforces a
trade-off between the stage's acceleration and closed-loop stiffness and thus
limits the system's overall performance. To overcome this challenge, this paper
proposes a new hardware design and control framework for lightweight precision
motion stages with the stage's low-frequency flexible modes actively
controlled. Our method proposes to minimize the resonance frequency of the
controlled mode to reduce the stage's weight, and to maximize that of the
uncontrolled mode to enable high control bandwidth. In addition, the proposed
framework determines the placement of the actuators and sensors to maximize the
controllability/observability of the stage's controlled flexible mode while
minimizing that of the uncontrolled mode, which effectively simplifies the
controller designs. Two case studies are used to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. Simulation results show that the stage designed using
the proposed method has a weight reduction of more than 55% compared to a
baseline stage design. Improvement in control bandwidth was also achieved.
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving
lightweight precision positioning stages with high acceleration, bandwidth, and

  Causality-Based Localization vs. Knowledge Editing in Language Models","20 pages, 17 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Language models are known to learn a great quantity of factual information
during pretraining, and recent work localizes this information to specific
model weights like mid-layer MLP weights (Meng et al., 2022). In this paper, we
find that we can change how a fact is stored in a model by editing weights that
are in a different location than where existing methods suggest that the fact
is stored. This is surprising because we would expect that localizing facts to
specific parameters in models would tell us where to manipulate knowledge in
models, and this assumption has motivated past work on model editing methods.
Specifically, we show that localization conclusions from representation
denoising (also known as Causal Tracing) do not provide any insight into which
model MLP layer would be best to edit in order to override an existing stored
fact with a new one. This finding raises questions about how past work relies
on Causal Tracing to select which model layers to edit (Meng et al., 2022).
Next, to better understand the discrepancy between representation denoising and
weight editing, we develop several variants of the editing problem that appear
more and more like representation denoising in their design and objective.
Experiments show that, for one of our editing problems, editing performance
does relate to localization results from representation denoising, but we find
that which layer we edit is a far better predictor of performance. Our results
suggest, counterintuitively, that better mechanistic understanding of how
pretrained language models work may not always translate to insights about how
to best change their behavior. Code is available at:

shed light on the role of the ocean in the global climate context. Solutions
vary from physical modeling, and long-term observations, to short-term

prediction that uses Lagrangian floaters for water current prediction by
interpolating the trajectory of the elements to reflect the velocity field.
Here, an important aspect that has not been addressed before is where to
initially deploy the drifting elements such that the acquired velocity field
would efficiently represent the water current. To that end, we use a clustering
approach that relies on a physical model of the velocity field. Our method
segments the modeled map and determines the deployment locations as those that
will lead the floaters to 'visit' the center of the different segments. This
way, we validate that the area covered by the floaters will capture the
in-homogeneously in the velocity field. Exploration over a dataset of velocity
field maps that span over a year demonstrates the applicability of our
approach, and shows a considerable improvement over the common approach of
uniformly randomly choosing the initial deployment sites. Finally, our

maintain connectivity during temporary blockages. In outdoor environments, such
reflections may not be available and prior work relied on dense base station

nanofluidic systems, but require descriptions that go beyond traditional
macroscopic hydrodynamics. In this letter, we demonstrate how equilibrium
molecular dynamics simulations and linear response theory can be synthesized
with hydrodynamics to provide a comprehensive characterization of nanofluidic
transport. Specifically, we study the pressure driven flows of ionic solutions
in nanochannels comprised of two-dimensional crystalline substrates made from
graphite and hexagonal boron nitride. While simple hydrodynamic descriptions do
not predict a streaming electrical current or salt selectivity in such simple
systems, we observe that both arise due to the intrinsic molecular interactions
that act to selectively adsorb ions to the interface in the absence of a net
surface charge. Notably, this emergent selectivity indicates that these
nanochannels can serve as desalination membranes.

case of the white-dwarf companions of Barium stars, the situation is worse.
These stars are dim, cool, and difficult to observe via direct methods.
However, Ba stars were polluted by the Asymptotic Giant Branch progenitors of
these WDs with matter rich in heavy elements, and the properties of their WD
companions contain key information about binary interaction processes involving
AGB stars and about the slow-neutron-capture(s)-process of nucleosynthesis. We
aim to determine accurate and assumption-free masses for the WD companions of
as many Ba stars as possible. We want to provide new observational constraints
that can help us learn about the formation and evolution of these
post-interaction binary systems and about the nucleosynthesis processes that
took place in the interiors of their AGB progenitors. We combined archival
radial-velocity data with Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry using the software
package orvara, a code designed to simultaneously fit a single Keplerian model
to any combination of these types of data using a parallel-tempering Markov
chain Monte Carlo method. We adopted Gaussian priors for the Ba star masses and
for the parallaxes, and assumed uninformative priors for the orbital elements
and the WD masses. We determined new orbital inclinations and companion masses
for 60 Ba star systems, including a couple of new orbits and several improved
orbits for the longest-period systems. We also unravelled a triple system that
was not known before and constrained the orbits and the masses of the two
companions. (Continued in the manuscript)

regions in urban settings characterized by sparsity, variance in both space and
time, and anomalous events. Missing regions in urban data can be caused by
sensor or software failures, data quality issues, interference from weather
events, incomplete data collection, or varying data use regulations; any
missing data can render the entire dataset unusable for downstream
applications. To ensure coverage and utility, we adapt computer vision
techniques for image inpainting to operate on 3D histograms (2D space + 1D
time) commonly used for data exchange in urban settings.
  Adapting these techniques to the spatiotemporal setting requires handling
skew: urban data tend to follow population density patterns (small dense
regions surrounded by large sparse areas); these patterns can dominate the
learning process and fool the model into ignoring local or transient effects.
To combat skew, we 1) train simultaneously in space and time, and 2) focus
attention on dense regions by biasing the masks used for training to the skew
in the data. We evaluate the core model and these two extensions using the NYC
taxi data and the NYC bikeshare data, simulating different conditions for
missing data. We show that the core model is effective qualitatively and
quantitatively, and that biased masking during training reduces error in a
variety of scenarios. We also articulate a tradeoff in varying the number of
timesteps per training sample: too few timesteps and the model ignores
transient events; too many timesteps and the model is slow to train with
limited performance gain.

research works have been done to investigate the different characteristics of
logging practices in traditional software systems (e.g., Android applications,

Pytorch, Tensorflow, Theano, MXNet, Scikit-Learn, Caffe, and Keras. Despite the
popularity of ML, we don't have a clear understanding of logging practices in
ML applications. In this paper, we aim to fill this knowledge gap and help ML
practitioners understand the characteristics of logging in ML-based
applications. In particular, we conduct an empirical study on 110 open-source
ML-based applications. Through a quantitative analysis, we find that logging
practice in ML-based applications is less pervasive than in traditional
applications including Android, JAVA, and C/C++ applications. Furthermore, the
majority of logging statements in ML-based applications are in info and warn

logging statement in C/C++ application and debug, error levels constitute the
majority of logging statement in Android application. We also perform a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of a random sample of logging statements
to understand where ML developers put most of logging statements and examine

observations: (i) ML developers put most of the logging statements in model
training, and in non-ML components. (ii) Data and model management appear to be
the main reason behind the introduction of logging statements in ML-based

inferential aspect of a bivariate Poisson conditionals distribution for which
both the conditionals are Poisson but the marginals are typically non-Poisson.
It has Poisson marginals only in the case of independence. It appears that a
simple iterative procedure under the maximum likelihood method performs quite
well as compared with other numerical subroutines, as one would expect in such
a case where the MLEs are not available in closed form. In the Bayesian
paradigm, both conjugate priors and non-conjugate priors have been utilized and
a comparison study has been made via a simulation study. For illustrative

  Conjugacy Growth, and Partial Inner Automorphisms","51 pages",,,,"math.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The conjugacy relation plays an important role in group theory. If $a$ and
$b$ are elements of a group~$G$, $a$ is conjugate to $b$ if $g^{-1}ag=b$ for
some $g\in G$. Group conjugacy extends to inverse semigroups in a natural way:
for $a$ and $b$ in an inverse semigroup $S$, $a$ is conjugate to $b$ if
$g^{-1}ag=b$ and $gbg^{-1}=a$ for some $g\in S$. The fourth author has recently
defined a conjugacy for an arbitrary semigroup $S$ that coincides with inverse
semigroup conjugacy if $S$ is an inverse semigroup, and is included in all
existing semigroup conjugacy relations. We will call it the \emph{natural
conjugacy} for semigroups, and denote it by $\cfn$.
  The first purpose of this paper is to study $\cfn$ in various contexts,
chiefly the partition monoid and some of its friends (Brauer and partial Brauer
monoids), and also to characterize $\cfn$ in several important classes of
semigroups, transformation semigroups and in the polycyclic monoids.
  The second purpose of this paper is to show how the notion of natural
conjugacy leads to the definition of the inverse semigroup of partial
automorphisms of an arbitrary semigroup (in the same way conjugation in groups
induces the notion of inner automorphism). Attached to the majority of
mathematical objects there is a notion of {\em morphism} and hence notions of
automorphism and endomorphism that often encode relevant information about the
original object. Our approach allows to attach to the endomorphisms of a
mathematical object an inverse semigroup that hopefully will bring the deep
results on inverse semigroups to help the study of the original object.
  Finally we extend the notion of conjugacy growth from groups to semigroups
and give closed formulas for the conjugacy growth series of the polycyclic
monoid, for $\cfn$ and two other semigroup conjugacies.
  The paper ends with some open problems.

This is because the presence of the additional energy component enhances the
growth of matter fluctuations during the radiation dominated epoch. Instead of
considering a particular model, we focus on a parametric family of Gaussian
bumps in the matter power spectrum, which otherwise would be a $\Lambda$CDM
one. We study the evolution of such bump cosmologies and their effects in the
halo mass function and halo power spectrum using N-body simulations, the
halo-model based HMcode method, and the peak background split framework. The
bumps are subject to different nonlinear effects that become physically well

""class-level"" contextual information during learning. However, these approaches
simply concatenate class-level information to pixel features to boost the pixel

contextual information. Moreover, these approaches learn soft class centers
based on coarse mask prediction, which is prone to error accumulation. To
better exploit class level information, we propose a universal Class-Aware
Regularization (CAR) approach to optimize the intra-class variance and
inter-class distance during feature learning, motivated by the fact that humans
can recognize an object by itself no matter which other objects it appears
with. Moreover, we design a dedicated decoder for CAR (CARD), which consists of
a novel spatial token mixer and an upsampling module, to maximize its gain for
existing baselines while being highly efficient in terms of computational cost.
Specifically, CAR consists of three novel loss functions. The first loss
function encourages more compact class representations within each class, the
second directly maximizes the distance between different class centers, and the
third further pushes the distance between inter-class centers and pixels.
Furthermore, the class center in our approach is directly generated from ground
truth instead of from the error-prone coarse prediction. CAR can be directly
applied to most existing segmentation models during training, and can largely
improve their accuracy at no additional inference overhead. Extensive
experiments and ablation studies conducted on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed CAR can boost the accuracy of all baseline models
by up to 2.23% mIOU with superior generalization ability. CARD outperforms SOTA
approaches on multiple benchmarks with a highly efficient architecture.

units (GPUs). We take advantage of the computational power of GPUs to optimise
the computationally expensive algorithms behind the original SOAP 2.0 code. We
develope GPU kernels that allow to model stellar activity on any given
wavelength range. In addition to the treatment of stellar activity at the
spectral level, SOAP-GPU also includes the change of spectral line bisectors
from center to limb, and can take as input PHOENIX spectra to model the quiet
photosphere, spots and faculae, which allow to simulate stellar activity for a
wide space in stellar properties. Benchmark calculations show that for the same
accuracy, this new code improves the computational speed by a factor of 60

modeling stellar activity on the full visible spectral range with a resolution
of R=115'000. Although the code now includes the variation of spectral line
bisector with center to limb angle, the effect on the derived RVs is small. The
publicly available SOAP-GPU code allows to efficiently model stellar activity
at the spectral level, which is essential to test further stellar activity
mitigation techniques working at the level of spectral timeseries not affected

concerns about significant potential threats posed by I-IRSs, we propose an

using an I-IRS to actively change wireless channels, the orthogonality of
multi-user beamforming vectors and the co-user channels is destroyed, and
significant inter-user interference is then caused, which is referred to as
active channel aging. Such a fully-passive jammer (FPJ) can launch jamming
attacks on multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems via
inter-user interference caused by active channel aging, where the IJ requires

Independent System Operators (ISOs) proposed system-level market power
mitigation (MPM) policies in addition to existing local policies. These
policies aim to substitute noncompetitive bids with a default bid based on
estimated generator costs. However, these policies may lead to unintended
consequences when implemented without accounting for the conflicting interest
of participants. In this paper, we model the competition between generators
(bidding supply functions) and loads (bidding quantity) in a two-stage market
with a stage-wise MPM policy. An equilibrium analysis shows that a real-time
MPM policy leads to equilibrium loss, meaning no stable market outcome (Nash
equilibrium) exists. A day-ahead MPM policy, besides, leads to a
Stackelberg-Nash game with loads acting as leaders and generators as followers.
In this setting, loads become winners, i.e., their aggregate payment is always
less than competitive payments. Moreover, comparison with standard market
equilibrium highlights that markets are better off without such policies.
Finally, numerical studies highlight the impact of heterogeneity and load size
on market equilibrium.

Then how does it affect the visibility of the instrument? Yes, it will be less,
but how weak? Furthermore, what is the math to reach it? These questions pushed
for this work. Here, one can find the detailed derivation starting from a
simple Young's double slit experiment to a radio interferometer intensity
distribution in terms of the Gain of the antenna element. This literature aided
in understanding the interferometer of yagi antennas of Gain 11dBi, resulting
in a visibility of 0.0714. This clarity was insignificant in the current work.
Hence using this work, one can design and construct a suited interferometer for
their requirement.

Boussinesq convection. We determine the heat flux, composition gradient and
P\'eclet number, $\mathrm{Pe}$ (the ratio of thermal diffusion time to
convective turnover time) as a function of the composition flux. We find two
regimes of convection with a rapid transition between them as the composition
flux increases. At small Pe, the ratio between the heat flux and composition
flux is independent of Pe,, because the loss of heat from convecting fluid
elements due to thermal diffusion is offset by the smaller composition gradient
needed to overcome the reduced thermal buoyancy. At large Pe, the temperature
gradient approaches the adiabatic gradient, saturating the heat flux. We
discuss the implications for neutron star and white dwarf cooling. Convection
in neutron stars spans both regimes. We find rapid mixing of neutron star
oceans, with a convective turnover time of order weeks to minutes depending on
rotation. Except during the early stages of core crystallization, white dwarf
convection is in the thermal-diffusion-dominated fingering regime. We find
convective velocities much smaller than recent estimates for

molecular configurations at linear cost at generation for materials in which
structural correlations decay sufficiently rapidly. The algorithm is
implemented using an augmented PixelCNN deep learning architecture that we
previously demonstrated produces excellent results in 2 dimensions for
mono-elemental molecular systems. Here we extend our implementation to
multi-elemental 3D and demonstrate performance using water as our test system
in two scenarios: 1. liquid water, and 2. a sample with a small ice nucleus. We
trained the model on small-scale samples of liquid water produced using
path-integral molecular dynamics simulation including nuclear quantum effects
under ambient conditions. MAP-generated water configurations are shown to
accurately reproduce the properties of the training set and to produce stable
and physically sound behaviors when used to initialize classical and quantum
dynamical simulations. We expect our approach to perform equally well on other
disordered molecular systems given a suitable training set.

respectively, serves as a 3D analogue of the SSH model. First, we confirm that
the two dimerized Bi structures belong to different Zak phases of 0 and $\pi$
by considering the parity eigenvalues and Wannier charge centers, while the
previously reported bulk topological phases of Bi remain invariant under the
dimerization reversal. Next, we demonstrate the existence of topologically
non-trivial $(111)$ and trivial $(11\bar{2})$ DWs in which the number of in-gap
DW states (ignoring spin) is odd and even respectively, and show how this
controls the interlinking of the Zak phases of the two adjacent domains.
Finally, we derive general criteria specifying when a DW of arbitrary
orientation exhibits a $\pi$ Zak phase based on the flip of parity eigenvalues.
An experimental realization of dimerization in Bi and the formation of DWs may
be achieved via intense femtosecond laser excitations that can alter the
interatomic forces and bond lengths.

mergers and are expected to be powerful multi-messenger sources. They can be
powered by the accretion of matter and shine throughout the electromagnetic
spectrum similarly to normal active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Current
electromagnetic observatories have good chances to detect and identify these
systems in the near future, but we need precise observational indicators to
distinguish single AGNs from SMBHBs. In this work, we propose a novel
electromagnetic signature from SMBHBs: periodic flares caused by the
interaction between the jets launched by the black holes. We investigate close
black hole binaries accreting matter from a circumbinary disc and the
mini-discs formed around each hole, and launching magnetically-dominated jets
in the direction of their spin through the Blandfor--Znajeck mechanism. If the
spins are slightly inclined, the two jets will encounter each other once per
orbit. We argue that this interaction may trigger strong magnetic reconnection
events where particles are accelerated and form plasmoids that emit non-thermal
radiation. We model the evolution of these particles and calculate the
radiative output obtaining spectra and light curves at different wavelengths.
We show that these flares can significantly shine in radio, soft X-rays, and
\gamma rays, providing a periodic multi-wavelength electromagnetic signature

query and point of interest (POI) matching connects users' intent with
real-world geographic information. Recently, pre-trained models (PTMs) have
made advancements in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Generic
text-based PTMs do not have enough geographic knowledge for query-POI matching.
To overcome this limitation, related literature attempts to employ
domain-adaptive pre-training based on geo-related corpus. However, a query
generally contains mentions of multiple geographic objects, such as nearby
roads and regions of interest (ROIs). The geographic context (GC), i.e., these
diverse geographic objects and their relationships, is therefore pivotal to
retrieving the most relevant POI. Single-modal PTMs can barely make use of the
important GC and therefore have limited performance. In this work, we propose a
novel query-POI matching method Multi-modal Geographic language model (MGeo),
which comprises a geographic encoder and a multi-modal interaction module. MGeo
represents GC as a new modality and is able to fully extract multi-modal
correlations for accurate query-POI matching. Besides, there is no publicly
available benchmark for this topic. In order to facilitate further research, we
build a new open-source large-scale benchmark Geographic TExtual Similarity
(GeoTES). The POIs come from an open-source geographic information system
(GIS). The queries are manually generated by annotators to prevent privacy
issues. Compared with several strong baselines, the extensive experiment
results and detailed ablation analyses on GeoTES demonstrate that our proposed
multi-modal pre-training method can significantly improve the query-POI
matching capability of generic PTMs, even when the queries' GC is not provided.

viscoelasticity. The shear thinning effect is important as the polymers used in
chemical enhanced oil recovery usually have this property. We propose a novel
approach to incorporate this shear thinning effect through an effective dynamic
viscosity of the shear thinning polysolution. The procedure of viscosity
calculation of the polysolution, although based on a very basic power law
model, is based on empiric coefficients which depends on a spatio-temporally
evolving variable namely concentration of polymer. Since viscosity calculation
is done pointwise, the accuracy of the model is higher than what exists in
literature. This method has been integrated with an existing method for a
Newtonian physics based model of porous media flows. The solver uses a hybrid
numerical method developed by Daripa \&
Dutta~\cite{DFEMcode,daripa2017modeling,daripa2019convergence}. The above
method solves a system of coupled elliptic and transport equations modelling
Darcy's law based polymer flooding process using a discontinuous finite element

effects of shear thinning and mobility ratio; (ii) injection conditions such as
injection rate and injected polymer concentration influence the choice of
polymers to optimise cumulative oil recovery; (iii) permeability affects the

important ingredients for reaction theories. Theoretical formulations were
introduced early by Feshbach and Watson, and efforts of deriving and computing
those `optical potentials' in a microscopic fashion have a long tradition.
However, only recently the leading order term in the Watson multiple scattering
approach could be calculated fully {\it ab initio}, meaning that the same
nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction enters both the structure as well as the
reaction pieces on equal footing. This allows the uncertainties from the
underlying chiral effective NN interaction to be systematically explored in
nucleon-nucleus elastic scattering observables.
  In this contribution the main ingredients for arriving at the {\it ab initio}
leading order of the effective nucleon-nucleus interaction in the Watson
approach will be reviewed. Concentrating on one specific chiral NN interaction
from the LENPIC collaboration and light nuclei with a 0$^+$ ground state, the
leading order nucleon-nucleus interaction is calculated using up to the third
chiral order (N2LO) in the nucleon-nucleon potential, and elastic scattering
observables are extracted. Then pointwise as well as correlated uncertainty
quantification is used for the estimation of the chiral truncation error.
Elastic scattering observables for $^4$He, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O for between
65 and 200 MeV projectile energy will be analyzed.

transmitter-receiver operations are modeled as an encoder-decoder pair that is
jointly trained while considering channel effects. The encoder converts data
samples into feature vectors of small dimension and transmits them with a small
number of channel uses thereby reducing the number of transmissions and
latency. Instead of reconstructing input samples, the decoder performs a task,
e.g., classification, on the received signals. Applying different deep neural
networks of encoder-decoder pairs on MNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets, the
classifier accuracy is shown to increase with the number of channel uses at the
expense of longer service time. The peak age of task information (PAoTI) is
introduced to analyze this accuracy-latency tradeoff when the age grows unless
a received signal is classified correctly. By incorporating channel and traffic
effects, design guidelines are obtained for task-oriented communications by
characterizing how the PAoTI first decreases and then increases with the number
of channel uses. A dynamic update mechanism is presented to adapt the number of
channel uses to channel and traffic conditions, and reduce the PAoTI in

passive IRS that reflects wireless signals without power amplification, while
in this article, we give an overview of a new type of IRS, called active IRS,
which enables simultaneous signal reflection and amplification, thus
significantly extending the signal coverage of passive IRS. We first present
the fundamentals of active IRS, including its hardware architecture, signal and
channel models, as well as practical constraints, in comparison with those of
passive IRS. Then, we discuss new considerations and open issues in designing
active-IRS-aided wireless communications, such as the reflection optimization,
channel estimation, and deployment for active IRS, as well as its integrated
design with passive IRS. Finally, numerical results are provided to show the
potential performance gains of active IRS as compared to passive IRS and
traditional active relay.

mining and natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as information

Unfortunately, it is prohibitively expensive to train the word embedding in a
relatively large corpus. We propose a graph-based word embedding algorithm,
called Word-Graph2vec, which converts the large corpus into a word
co-occurrence graph, then takes the word sequence samples from this graph by
randomly traveling and trains the word embedding on this sampling corpus in the
end. We posit that because of the stable vocabulary, relative idioms, and fixed
expressions in English, the size and density of the word co-occurrence graph
change slightly with the increase in the training corpus. So that
Word-Graph2vec has stable runtime on the large scale data set, and its
performance advantage becomes more and more obvious with the growth of the
training corpus. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets show
that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional Skip-Gram by four-five
times in terms of efficiency, while the error generated by the random walk
sampling is small.

detecting security vulnerability exploits. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art ML
models like long short-term memories (LSTMs) and transformers incur significant
computation overheads. This overhead makes it infeasible to deploy them in
real-time environments. We propose a novel ML-based exploit detection model,
ML-FEED, that enables highly efficient inference without sacrificing
performance. We develop a novel automated technique to extract vulnerability
patterns from the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures (CVE) databases. This feature enables ML-FEED to be aware of the
latest cyber weaknesses. Second, it is not based on the traditional approach of
classifying sequences of application programming interface (API) calls into
exploit categories. Such traditional methods that process entire sequences
incur huge computational overheads. Instead, ML-FEED operates at a finer
granularity and predicts the exploits triggered by every API call of the
program trace. Then, it uses a state table to update the states of these
potential exploits and track the progress of potential exploit chains. ML-FEED
also employs a feature engineering approach that uses natural language
processing-based word embeddings, frequency vectors, and one-hot encoding to
detect semantically-similar instruction calls. Then, it updates the states of
the predicted exploit categories and triggers an alarm when a vulnerability
fingerprint executes. Our experiments show that ML-FEED is 72.9x and 75,828.9x
faster than state-of-the-art lightweight LSTM and transformer models,

minority slab component, driven by the magnetic carpet and advected by a
subsonic, sub-Alfvenic flow from the lower corona. In this paper, we couple the
NI MHD turbulence transport model with an MHD model of the solar corona to
study the heating problem in a coronal loop. In a realistic benchmark coronal

and dissipation of MHD turbulence described by the NI MHD model. We also find
that the majority 2D component is as important as the minority slab component

This work is devoted to presenting a critical assessment by systematically
examining complex-valued DNNs against their real-valued counterparts.
Specifically, we investigate complex-valued DNN atomic units, including linear
layers, convolutional layers, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated linear
units. By comparing complex- and real-valued versions of fundamental building
blocks in the recently developed gated convolutional recurrent network (GCRN),

DNNs, i.e. deep complex convolutional recurrent network (DCCRN) and deep
complex U-Net (DCUNET). Evaluation results show that both DNNs produce
identical performance to their real-valued counterparts while requiring much

complex-valued DNNs do not provide a performance gain over their real-valued

with overlap fermions on three domain wall lattices with different sea pion
masses at lattice spacing 0.11 fm. Due to the chiral symmetry conserved by the
overlap fermions, we have well defined topological charge and chiral limit for
the EDM. Thus, the chiral extrapolation can be carried out reliably at nonzero
lattice spacings. We use three to four different partially quenched valence
pion masses for each sea pion mass and find that the EDM dependence on the
valence and sea pion masses behaves oppositely, which can be described by
partially quenched chiral perturbation theory. With the help of the cluster
decomposition error reduction (CDER) technique, we determine the neutron and
proton EDM at the physical pion mass to be
$d_{n}=-0.00148\left(14\right)\left(31\right)\bar\theta$ e$\cdot$fm and
$d_{p}=0.0038\left(11\right)\left(8\right)\bar\theta$ e$\cdot$fm. This work is
a clear demonstration of the advantages of using chiral fermions in the nucleon

relationship between language and environment. Then, the relational
representations of object-object, object-agent in ERG are learned through GCN,
so as to obtain a continuous expression about ERG. Sequentially, we combine the

Due to the difficulty of accessing direct measurements of the inner phenomena,
we determined the density distribution of its internal volume in order to
improve its productivity using muography. This is an imaging technique based on
the differential absorption of a flux of incident particles, muons, by the
target under study, similar to clinical X-ray imaging. Muons are elementary
particles that have the property of passing through dense materials, up to
hundreds of meters away. Their relative absorption and deviation allows the
generation of density distribution images of an object by tracking the number
of muons received by a detector, before and after passing through a structure.
The incident direction of the detected muons is reconstructed by means of a
detector composed of 3 scintillator panels that we moved on 3 positions around
the BF. With this technique, we obtained the first 3D image of the internal
structure of a BF using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inverse problem
solving algorithm on muon flux data. We were also able to perform a density
monitoring of the BF and some of its operating parameters. We distinguished the
position and shape of the cohesive zone, a key element in the productivity of a
furnace, validating this innovative measurement concept in the application to a
BF and opening the field to a series of future experiments to gain both spatial

measures, and thus the close contacts can boost the spread. We explicitly
incorporated that typically only a fraction of all household members are
infected. Thus, viewing the infection of a household of a given size as a
splitting process generating a new, small fully infected sub-household and a
remaining still susceptible sub-household we derive a compartmental ODE-model
for the dynamics of the sub-households. In this setting, the basic reproduction
number as well as prevalence and the peak of an infection wave in a population
with given households size distribution can be computed analytically. We
compare numerical simulation results of this novel household-ODE model with

the RAR has been claimed to manifest a new law of nature due to its regularity
and tightness, in agreement with Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). Fits to
this relation have been restricted by prior expectations to particular

accuracy with simplicity. Working with the SPARC data, we find the best
functions typically satisfy $g_\text{obs} \propto g_\text{bar}$ at high
$g_\text{bar}$, although the coefficient of proportionality is not clearly
unity and the deep-MOND limit $g_\text{obs} \propto \sqrt{g_\text{bar}}$ as
$g_\text{bar} \to 0$ is little evident at all. By generating mock data
according to MOND with or without the external field effect, we find that
symbolic regression would not be expected to identify the generating function

research interest from communities of databases, cryptography, and security; we
have witnessed significant advances in OPE schemes both theoretically and

modeled as a single semi-honest adversary who should learn nothing more than
the order information of plaintext messages up to a negligible probability.
This paper addresses the OPE problem from a new perspective: instead of
modeling the outsourced database as a single semi-honest adversary, we assume
the outsourced database \textit{service} compromises a cluster of non-colluding

multiple database instances deployed to exclusive sub-networks or even to

via electron microscopy is difficult owing to their low resistance to electron
irradiation. Subsequently, the fundamental relationships between these

imaging technique, optimum bright-field scanning transmission electron

a high signal-to-noise ratio and a dose efficiency approximately two orders of

low-dose atomic-resolution OBF STEM observations of an FAU-type zeolite,
effectively visualizing all the atomic sites in its framework. Additionally,
the complex local atomic structure of the twin boundaries in the zeolite was
directly characterized. The results of this study facilitate the
characterization of the local atomic structures in many electron-beam-sensitive

propose an efficient method for the deterministic selection of labeled nodes:
the Determinate Node Selection (DNS) algorithm. The DNS algorithm identifies
two categories of representative nodes in the graph: typical nodes and
divergent nodes. These labeled nodes are selected by exploring the structure of
the graph and determining the ability of the nodes to represent the
distribution of data within the graph. The DNS algorithm can be applied quite
simply on a wide range of semi-supervised graph neural network models for node
classification tasks. Through extensive experimentation, we have demonstrated
that the incorporation of the DNS algorithm leads to a remarkable improvement
in the average accuracy of the model and a significant decrease in the standard

vehicles (CAVs) have gathered considerable momentum and research attention.
Generally, such problems present strong non-linearity and non-convexity,
rendering great difficulties in finding the optimal solution. Existing methods
typically suffer from low computational efficiency, and this hinders the
appropriate applications in large-scale scenarios involving an increasing
number of vehicles. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel decentralized
iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) algorithm by leveraging the dual
consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). First, the
original non-convex optimization problem is reformulated into a series of
convex optimization problems through iterative neighbourhood approximation.
Then, the dual of each convex optimization problem is shown to have a consensus
structure, which facilitates the use of consensus ADMM to solve for the dual
solution in a fully decentralized and parallel architecture. Finally, the
primal solution corresponding to the trajectory of each vehicle is recovered by
solving a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem iteratively, and a novel
trajectory update strategy is proposed to ensure the dynamic feasibility of
vehicles. With the proposed development, the computation burden is
significantly alleviated such that real-time performance is attainable. Two
traffic scenarios are presented to validate the proposed algorithm, and
thorough comparisons between our proposed method and baseline methods
(including centralized iLQR, IPOPT, and SQP) are conducted to demonstrate the
scalability of the proposed approach.

place-recognition techniques: tightly coupled place similarity and odometry
uncertainty search, creating loop descriptors from origin-shifted scans, and
delaying loop selection until after verification. Robustness to false

ones from multiple loop constraints. Importantly, the verification and
selection are carried out after registration when additional sources of loop
evidence can easily be computed. We integrate our loop retrieval and
verification method with a fault-resilient odometry pipeline within a pose

threats, such as intellectual property infringement and overproduction. Due to
the increased attention that threats have received, many efficient specialized
attacks against logic locking have been introduced over the years. However, the
ability of an adversary to manipulate a locked netlist prior to mounting an
attack has not been investigated thoroughly. This paper introduces a
resynthesis-based strategy that utilizes the strength of a commercial
electronic design automation (EDA) tool to reveal the vulnerabilities of a
locked circuit. To do so, in a pre-attack step, a locked netlist is
resynthesized using different synthesis parameters in a systematic way, leading
to a large number of functionally equivalent but structurally different locked
circuits. Then, under the oracle-less threat model, where it is assumed that
the adversary only possesses the locked circuit, not the original circuit to
query, a prominent attack is applied to these generated netlists collectively,
from which a large number of key bits are deciphered. Nevertheless, this paper
also describes how the proposed oracle-less attack can be integrated with an
oracle-guided attack. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated
for several benchmarks, including remarkable results for breaking a recently
proposed provably secure logic locking method and deciphering values of a large
number of key bits of the CSAW'19 circuits with very high accuracy.

mode choice prediction poses an interesting question to transport modellers:
which models should be used for which applications? The answer to this question
goes beyond simple predictive performance, and is instead a balance of many
factors, including behavioural interpretability and explainability,
computational complexity, and data efficiency. There is a growing body of
research which attempts to compare the predictive performance of different ML
classifiers with classical random utility models. However, existing studies
typically analyse only the disaggregate predictive performance, ignoring other
aspects affecting model choice. Furthermore, many studies are affected by
technical limitations, such as the use of inappropriate validation schemes,
incorrect sampling for hierarchical data, lack of external validation, and the
exclusive use of discrete metrics. We address these limitations by conducting a
systematic comparison of different modelling approaches, across multiple
modelling problems, in terms of the key factors likely to affect model choice
(out-of-sample predictive performance, accuracy of predicted market shares,
extraction of behavioural indicators, and computational efficiency). We combine
several real world datasets with synthetic datasets, where the data generation
function is known. The results indicate that the models with the highest
disaggregate predictive performance (namely extreme gradient boosting and
random forests) provide poorer estimates of behavioural indicators and
aggregate mode shares, and are more expensive to estimate, than other models,
including deep neural networks and Multinomial Logit (MNL). It is further
observed that the MNL model performs robustly in a variety of situations,
though ML techniques can improve the estimates of behavioural indices such as
Willingness to Pay.

the atmospheric parameters of each binary component using the composite and/or

autonomous driving in complex traffic environments. In recent years, artificial
intelligence has shown strong capabilities in improving prediction accuracy.
However, its characteristics of inexplicability and uncertainty make it
challenging to determine the traffic environmental effect on prediction
explicitly, posing significant challenges to safety-critical decision-making.
To address these challenges, this study proposes a trajectory prediction
framework with the epistemic uncertainty estimation ability that outputs high
uncertainty when confronting unforeseeable or unknown scenarios. The proposed
framework is used to analyze the environmental effect on the prediction
algorithm performance. In the analysis, the traffic environment is considered
in terms of scenario features and shifts, respectively, where features are
divided into kinematic features of a target agent, features of its surrounding
traffic participants, and other features. In addition, feature correlation and
importance analyses are performed to study the above features' influence on the
prediction error and epistemic uncertainty. Further, a cross-dataset case study
is conducted using multiple intersection datasets to investigate the impact of
unavoidable distributional shifts in the real world on trajectory prediction.
The results indicate that the deep ensemble-based method has advantages in

on top of the familiar supertranslations and superrotations. They were
discovered in arXiv:2205.01422 by working in the Special Double Null (SDN)
gauge, where $\mathscr{I}^{+}$ and $\mathscr{I}^{-}$ are approached along
$null$ directions. It was observed there that while the hair degrees of freedom
associated to these diffeomorphisms show up in the covariant surfaces charges,
the diffeomorphisms themselves do not. This made their status intermediate in
some ways between global symmetries and trivial gauge transformations, making
interpretation ambiguous. In this paper, we revisit the fall-offs considered in
arXiv:2205.01422 which were strictly subleading to Minkowski in conventional
double null coordinates. We identify a new class of fall-offs where this
assumption is relaxed, but whose charges nonetheless remain finite. Remarkably,
the leading behavior is still Riemann flat, indicating that these are soft
modes. With this more refined definition of asymptotic flatness, we show that
leading hypertranslations and leading hyperrotations explicitly show up in the
charges. This makes them genuine global symmetries of asymptotically flat
Einstein gravity in the SDN gauge. We write down the new algebra of asymptotic
Killing vectors that subsumes the BMS algebra.

presents HeaderGen, a novel tool-based approach that automatically annotates
code cells with categorical markdown headers based on a taxonomy of
machine-learning operations, and classifies and displays function calls
according to this taxonomy. For this functionality to be realized, HeaderGen
enhances an existing call graph analysis in PyCG. To improve precision,
HeaderGen extends PyCG's analysis with support for handling external library
code and flow-sensitivity. The former is realized by facilitating the
resolution of function return-types. Furthermore, HeaderGen uses type
information to perform pattern matching on code syntax to annotate code cells.
  The evaluation on 15 real-world Jupyter notebooks from Kaggle shows that
HeaderGen's underlying call graph analysis yields high accuracy (96.4%
precision and 95.9% recall). This is because HeaderGen can resolve return-types
of external libraries where existing type inference tools such as pytype (by
Google), pyright (by Microsoft), and Jedi fall short. The header generation has
a precision of 82.2% and a recall rate of 96.8% with regard to headers created

HeaderGen as useful to their task.

component is estimated by a Kalman filter algorithm.The algorithm obtains one-

Thus, depending on the number of years the investigator wants to consider as
""the most recent"", the expected trend for these years is estimated through the
statistical procedure by using only information from the years prior to
them.Forecast bands are estimated around the predicted trends for the recent
years, and in the final step, an assessment is made on the extent to which
observations from the most recent years fall outside these forecast bands.
Those that do, may be identified as flagged observations. A procedure is also
presented for assessing whether the combined information from all of the most
recent observations form a pattern that deviates from the predicted trend and
thus represents an unexpected tendency that may be flagged. In addition to form
the basis for identifying time series that should be prioritized in an
integrated ecosystem assessment, flagged observations can provide the basis for
communicating with managers and stakeholders about recent ecosystem
change.Applications of the framework are illustrated with two worked examples.

measure the electric field's standard deviation $\sigma_E$. From a
semi-analytical ansatz we find that for a lithium ion battery there is a direct

$\pi_1(1600)$ structures may correspond to dynamically generated states, with
the former one coupled mostly to the $b_1\pi$ component and the latter one
coupled to the $K_1(1270)\bar{K}$ channel. In particular, our result for the
ratio $\Gamma(\pi_1(1600)\to f_1(1285)\pi)/ \Gamma(\pi_1(1600)\to

mass about 1.7~GeV in the $I=1/2$ sector, which may be responsible for the
$K^*(1680)$. We suggest searching for two additional $\eta_1$ exotic mesons

  Language-specific Training",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Entity and relation extraction is a key task in information extraction, where
the output can be used for downstream NLP tasks. Existing approaches for entity
and relation extraction tasks mainly focus on the English corpora and ignore
other languages. Thus, it is critical to improving performance in a
multilingual setting. Meanwhile, multilingual training is usually used to boost
cross-lingual performance by transferring knowledge from languages (e.g.,
high-resource) to other (e.g., low-resource) languages. However, language
interference usually exists in multilingual tasks as the model parameters are
shared among all languages. In this paper, we propose a two-stage multilingual
training method and a joint model called Multilingual Entity and Relation
Extraction framework (mERE) to mitigate language interference across languages.
Specifically, we randomly concatenate sentences in different languages to train
a Language-universal Aggregator (LA), which narrows the distance of embedding
representations by obtaining the unified language representation. Then, we
separate parameters to mitigate interference via tuning a Language-specific
Switcher (LS), which includes several independent sub-modules to refine the
language-specific feature representation. After that, to enhance the relational
triple extraction, the sentence representations concatenated with the relation
feature are used to recognize the entities. Extensive experimental results show
that our method outperforms both the monolingual and multilingual baseline
methods. Besides, we also perform detailed analysis to show that mERE is
lightweight but effective on relational triple extraction and mERE{} is easy to
transfer to other backbone models of multi-field tasks, which further
demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.

model systems where polarization curling originates from open circuit like
electric boundary conditions, to avoid the build-up of polarization charges
through the formation of flux closure domains that evolve into vortex like
structures at the nanoscale. Interestingly, while ferroelectricity is known to
couple strongly to strain (both homogeneous and inhomogeneous), the effect of
mechanical constraints on thin film nanoscale ferroelectrics has been
comparatively less explored because of the relative paucity of strain patterns
that can be implemented experimentally. Here we show that the stacking of
freestanding ferroelectric perovskite layers with controlled twist angles opens
an unprecedented opportunity to tailor these topological nanostructures in a
way determined by the lateral strain modulation associated to the twisting.
Interestingly, we find that a peculiar pattern of polarization vortices and

Gaia astrometry and all available photometric time series coming from the

1151 in a 390d orbit at a separation of 0.57 au. Evidence for a second
modulation is also present; this could be due to long-term magnetic variability
or a second (substellar) companion. The star shows episodes of elevated
magnetic activity, one of which could be linked to the observed LOFAR radio
emission. We show that it is highly unlikely that the detected GJ 1151 b, or
any additional outer companion is the source of the detected signal. We cannot
firmly rule out the suggested explanation of an undetected short-period planet
that could be related to the radio emission, as we establish an upper limit of
1.2 M$_{\oplus}$ for the minimum mass.

that the distribution of entangled quantum states is less efficient than that
of product states, a thorough quantification of this inefficiency (namely, of
the difference between the quantum-state transfer fidelity for entangled and
factorized states) has not been performed. To this end, in this work, we
consider $n$-independent amplitude-damping channels, acting in parallel, i.e.,
each, locally, on one part of an $n$-qubit state. We derive exact analytical
results for the fidelity decrease, with respect to the case of product states,

Interestingly, we find that genuine multipartite entanglement has a more
detrimental effect on the fidelity than two-qubit entanglement. Our results
hint at the fact that, for larger $n$-qubit states, the difference in the
average fidelity between product and entangled states increases with increasing
single-qubit fidelity, thus making the latter a less trustworthy figure of
merit.

lattice with sub-wavelength spatial structure. The potential is formed by the
nonlinear optical response of the three-level Rydberg-dressed atoms, which is

trajectories and trajectory tracking controller for the second-order chained
form system. The system is well-known as a canonical form for a class of
second-order nonholonomic systems obtained by appropriate transformation of the
generalized coordinates and control inputs. The system is decomposed into three
subsystems, two of them are the so-called double integrators and the other
subsystem is a nonlinear system depending on one of the double integrators. The
double integrators are linearly controllable, which enables to transit the
value of the position state in order to modify the nature of the nonlinear
system that depends on them. Transiting the value to ""one"" corresponds to
modifying the nonlinear subsystem into the double integrator; transiting the
value to ""zero"" corresponds to modifying the nonlinear subsystem into an
uncontrollable linear autonomous system. Focusing on this nature, this paper
proposes a feedforward control strategy. Furthermore, from the perspective of
practical usefulness, the control strategy is extended into trajectory tracking
control by using proportional-derivative feedback. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated through several numerical experiments including
an application to an underactuated manipulator.

occupancy grid maps to represent and predict dynamic environments. However,
these predictions suffer from blurriness, loss of scene structure at turns, and
vanishing of agents over longer prediction horizon. In this work, we propose a
novel framework to make long-term predictions by representing the traffic scene
in a fixed frame, referred as allo-centric occupancy grid. This allows for the
static scene to remain fixed and to represent motion of the ego-vehicle on the
grid like other agents'. We study the allo-centric grid prediction with
different video prediction networks and validate the approach on the real-world
Nuscenes dataset. The results demonstrate that the allo-centric grid
representation significantly improves scene prediction, in comparison to the
conventional ego-centric grid approach.

new way to control the propagation of light through dynamic complex media. Our
strategy is based on the observation that many dynamic scattering systems
exhibit a range of decorrelation times -- meaning that over a given timescale,
some parts of the medium may essentially remain static. We experimentally
demonstrate a suite of new techniques to identify and guide light through these
networks of static channels -- threading optical fields around multiple dynamic
pockets hidden at unknown locations inside opaque media. We first show how a
single stable light field propagating through a partially dynamic medium can be
found by optimising the wavefront of the incident field. Next, we demonstrate
how this procedure can be accelerated by 2 orders of magnitude using a
physically realised form of adjoint gradient descent optimisation. Finally, we
describe how the search for stable light modes can be posed as an eigenvalue
problem: we introduce a new optical matrix operator, the time-averaged
transmission matrix, and show how it reveals a basis of
fluctuation-eigenchannels that can be used for stable beam shaping through
time-varying media. These methods rely only on external camera measurements
recording scattered light, require no prior knowledge about the medium, and are
independent of the rate at which dynamic regions move. Our work has potential
future applications to a wide variety of technologies reliant on general wave
phenomena subject to dynamic conditions, from optics to acoustics.

such co-training models tend to converge early to a consensus, degenerating to

Uncertainty-guided Collaborative Mean-Teacher (UCMT) for semi-supervised

produce high-confidence pseudo labels. Combining the strengths of UMIX with
CMT, UCMT can retain model disagreement and enhance the quality of pseudo

the design of view transformation, either pixel-wisely lifting perspective view
features into 3D space with estimated depth or grid-wisely constructing BEV
features via 3D projection, treating all pixels or grids equally. However,
choosing what to transform is also important but has rarely been discussed
before. The pixels of a moving car are more informative than the pixels of the

transformation should be able to adapt to different image regions according to

FrustumFormer, which pays more attention to the features in instance regions

instance frustums on the bird's eye view by leveraging image view object
proposals. An adaptive occupancy mask within the instance frustum is learned to
refine the instance location. Moreover, the temporal frustum intersection could
further reduce the localization uncertainty of objects. Comprehensive

mobility data. This issue frequently brings more difficulty to relevant
learning tasks, such as trajectory imputation and prediction. Nowadays, little
existing work simultaneously deals with imputation and prediction on human
trajectories. This work plans to explore whether the learning process of
imputation and prediction could benefit from each other to achieve better
outcomes. And the question will be answered by studying the coexistence
patterns between missing points and observed ones in incomplete trajectories.
More specifically, the proposed model develops an imputation component based on
the self-attention mechanism to capture the coexistence patterns between
observations and missing points among encoder-decoder layers. Meanwhile, a
recurrent unit is integrated to extract the sequential embeddings from newly
imputed sequences for predicting the following location. Furthermore, a new
implementation called Imputation Cycle is introduced to enable gradual
imputation with prediction enhancement at multiple levels, which helps to
accelerate the speed of convergence. The experimental results on three
different real-world mobility datasets show that the proposed approach has
significant advantages over the competitive baselines across both imputation
and prediction tasks in terms of accuracy and stability.

forecasts are often poor. To address this, one can try to use output from
convection-parametrising (global) ensembles, post-processed to forecast at
point-scale, or convection-resolving limited area ensembles. In this study, we
combine both. First, we apply the ""ecPoint-rainfall"" post-processing to the
ECMWF global ensemble. Then, we use 2.2km COSMO LAM ensemble output (centred on
Italy), and also post-process it using a scale-selective neighbourhood approach
to compensate for insufficient members. The two components then undergo
lead-time-weighted blending, to create the final probabilistic 6h rainfall
forecasts. Product creation for forecasters constituted the ""Italy Flash Flood
use case"" within the EU-funded MISTRAL project and it will be a real-time
open-access product.
  One year of verification shows that ecPoint is the most skilful ensemble
product. The post-processed COSMO ensemble adds most value to summer convective
events in the evening, when the global model has an underprediction bias. In
two heavy rainfall case studies we observed underestimation of the largest
point totals in the raw ECMWF ensemble, and overestimation in the raw COSMO
ensemble. However, ecPoint increase the value and highlighted best the most
affected areas, whilst post-processing of COSMO diminished extremes by
eradicating unreliable detail. The final merged products looked best from a
user perspective and seemed to be the most skilful of all. Although our LAM
post-processing does not implicitly include bias correction (a topic for
further work) our study nonetheless provides a unique blueprint for
successfully combining ensemble rainfall forecasts from global and LAM systems
around the world. It also has important implications for forecast products as
global ensembles move ever closer to having convection-permitting resolution.

statistics. While this task is simple for low-dimensional observations, it
becomes challenging for more intricate objects, such as multivariate functions.
Here, the covariance can be so complex that just saving a non-parametric
estimate is impractical and structural assumptions are necessary to tame the
model. One popular assumption for space-time data is separability of the
covariance into purely spatial and temporal factors. In this paper, we present
a new test for separability in the context of dependent functional time series.
While most of the related work studies functional data in a Hilbert space of
square integrable functions, we model the observations as objects in the space
of continuous functions equipped with the supremum norm. We argue that this
(mathematically challenging) setup enhances interpretability for users and is
more in line with practical preprocessing.
  Our test statistic measures the maximal deviation between the estimated
covariance kernel and a separable approximation. Critical values are obtained
by a non-standard multiplier bootstrap for dependent data. We prove the
statistical validity of our approach and demonstrate its practicability in a

the amplitude of the charge gap in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulators.

clustering algorithm (HDBSCAN). The proposed scheme benefits from the strengths
of the three algorithms while avoiding most of the drawbacks of the individual
methods. Here the cc\_analysis algorithm is for the first time applied to
molecular simulation data. Encodermap complements cc\_analysis by providing an
efficient way to process and assign large amounts of data to clusters. The main
goal of the procedure is to maximize the number of assigned frames of a given
trajectory, while keeping a clear conformational identity of the clusters that
are found. In practice we achieve this by using an iterative clustering
approach and a tunable root-mean-square-deviation-based criterion in the final
cluster assignment. This allows to find clusters of different densities as well
as different degrees of structural identity. With the help of four test systems
we illustrate the capability and performance of this clustering workflow:
wild-type and thermostable mutant of the Trp-cage protein (TC5b and TC10b),
NTL9 and Protein B. Each of these systems poses individual challenges to the
scheme, which in total give a nice overview of the advantages, as well as
potential difficulties that can arise when using the proposed method.

Specifically, their effectiveness has been proven not only when considering a
single domain but also when taking into account multiple domains. However, the

In addition, consecutive Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) aggregations tend to
destroy the feature similarity. To overcome these issues, an architecture for
learning the graph connectivity in an end-to-end fashion is introduced. This is
done by integrating an attention-based mechanism and a similarity-preserving
strategy. The proposed framework is then extended to multiple domains using an

spectro-morphological characterisation of the residual emission including the

of extension $r_{68} = 4.4^\circ \pm 0.1^\circ\,^{+0.1^\circ}_{-0.1^\circ}$,

significantly different spectra. An additional extended emission component FCES
G78.83+3.57, located on the edge of the central cavities in Cygnus X and with a
spectrum compatible with that of FCES G80.00+0.50, is likely related to the
cocoon. For the two main components, spectra and radial-azimuthal profiles of
the emission can be accounted for in a diffusion-loss framework involving one
single population of non-thermal particles. Particles span the full extent of
FCES G78.74+1.56 as a result of diffusion from a central source, and give rise
to source FCES G80.00+0.50 by interacting with ionised gas in the innermost
region. For this simple diffusion-loss model, viable setups can be very
different in terms of energetics, transport conditions, and timescales
involved, and both hadronic and leptonic scenarios are possible. The solutions
range from long-lasting particle acceleration, possibly in prominent star
clusters such as Cyg OB2 and NGC 6910, to a more recent and short-lived release

Fast rotation, however, with Coriolis number exceeding unity suppresses this

the quadratic scheme (about $N$ times faster). In the strong coupling regime,
the cubic nonlinear dynamics enables the periodic in time generation of a broad
variety of new-type macroscopic superposition states, which allow us to realize
near-Heisenberg-limit phase sensitivity. In addition, we also reveal an
interesting feature that the amount of entanglement generated by the cubic
scheme has a macroscopic sensitivity to the parity of $N$, which has no
counterpart in quadratic nonlinear dynamics and can be exploited for sensing
the parity of $N$ at the single-spin level. We also propose a new approach for
a fast and high-fidelity generation of maximally entangled
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states. By using an alternative
cubic-quadratic-admixture type of nonlinear interaction, we show that one may
accelerate the procedure of GHZ-state generation. The realization of the cubic
nonlinear dynamics is also considered, showing that the cubic nonlinear
dynamics can be realized by either repeatedly using linear- and
quadratic-nonlinear dynamics or utilizing light-mediated interactions in just
one step. Finally, by taking realistic imperfections into account, we find that
the cubic scheme is sensitivity to the single-spin decay in the strong coupling

depression and anxiety. Social stigma makes people with depression and anxiety
neglected by their surroundings. Therefore, they turn to social media like
Twitter for support. Detecting users with potential depression and anxiety
disorders through textual data is not easy because they do not explicitly
discuss their mental state. It takes a model that can identify potential users
who experience depression and anxiety on textual data to get treatment earlier.
Text classification techniques can achieve this. One approach that can be used
is LSTM as an RNN architecture development in dealing with vanishing gradient
problems. Standard LSTM does not capture enough information because it can only
read sentences from one direction. Meanwhile, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) is a
two-way LSTM that can capture information without ignoring the context and
meaning of a sentence. The proposed BiLSTM model is higher than all traditional
machine learning models and standard LSTMs. Based on the test results, the
highest accuracy obtained by BiLSTM reached 94.12%. This study has succeeded in
developing a model for the detection of depression and anxiety in Twitter

Nonequilibrium versions are expected to add information on their dynamical

exclusion process provides a Fermi Golden Rule approximation upon adding births
and deaths at each dot. This yields a fermionic nonequilibrium steady state
where the heat capacity is computed exactly by evaluating the heat fluxes
entirely due to the changing of the ambient temperature. In particular, the
heat capacity depends on the symmetric kinetic barrier for loading and emptying
the quantum dot, invisible at equilibrium. Moreover, we find a zero-temperature
dynamical phase transition, shown by the sudden divergence of the heat capacity
when the Fermi energy and the kinetic barrier become approximately equal. The
nonvanishing heat capacity at absolute zero, violating an extended Third Law,
is caused by the relaxation times exceeding the dissipation time. Finally, when
the kinetic barrier is density-dependent, a low-temperature regime of negative
heat capacity appears, indicating an anti-correlation between the temperature

proteins that are key for early Drosophila embryogenesis. Here we develop an
approach for agent-based 3D modeling of the key components of transport by
molecular motors (by elements of the cytoskeleton) of the Drosophila
oocyte-syncytial embryo. The models were developed using Skeledyne software
developed by Odell and Foe [Odell and Foe, 2008]. We start with the results of
modeling transport along oriented microtubule (MT) bundles in the oocyte. This
is a model of transport systems in the Drosophila oocyte, where three maternal
mRNAs (bicoid (bcd), oskar, and gurken) that are key to embryonic polarity are
transported along their oriented MT bundles. Then we consider models of
oriented MT networks in the volume of a cell (oocyte) generated by a single
microtubule organization center (or a pair of the centers). This model
reproduces the formation of bcd mRNA intrusions deep into the cytoplasm in the
head half of the early syncytial embryo. Finally, we consider models for the
active transport of bcd mRNA in a syncytial embryo along a randomized network
of many short MT strands. In conclusion, we consider the prospects for the
implementation of cytoplasmic fountain flows in the active transport model.

charging stations are becoming vital infrastructure in a smart sustainable city
to provide on-demand electric vehicle (EV) charging services. As more consumers
seek to utilize public charging services, the pricing and scheduling of such
services will become vital, complementary tools to mediate competition for
charging resources. However, determining the right prices to charge is
difficult due to the online nature of EV arrivals. This paper studies a joint
pricing and scheduling problem for the operator of EV charging networks with
limited charging capacity and time-varying energy cost. Upon receiving a
charging request, the operator offers a price, and the EV decides whether to
admit the offer based on its own value and the posted price. The operator then
schedules the real-time charging process to satisfy the charging request if the
EV admits the offer. We propose an online pricing algorithm that can determine
the posted price and EV charging schedule to maximize social welfare, i.e., the
total value of EVs minus the energy cost of charging stations. Theoretically,
we prove the devised algorithm can achieve the order-optimal competitive ratio
under the competitive analysis framework. Practically, we show the empirical
performance of our algorithm outperforms other benchmark algorithms in
experiments using real EV charging data.

the normal to the wedge surface. This is the physical cause of the recently
observed asymmetric cooling of the droplet. A novel approximate computational

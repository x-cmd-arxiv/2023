the production of high quality compound semiconductors that are vital for
today's electronic applications. A simplified model of this process consists of
two 1D diffusion equations with free boundaries for the temperatures in crystal
and melt. Both phases are coupled via an ordinary differential equation that
describes the evolution of the moving solid/liquid interface. The control of
the resulting two-phase Stefan problem is the focus of this contribution. A
flatness-based feedforward design is combined with a multi-step backstepping
approach to obtain a controller that tracks a reference trajectory for the
position of the phase boundary. Specifically, based on some preliminary
transformations to map the model into a time-variant PDE-ODE system,
consecutive decoupling and backstepping transformations are shown to yield a
stable closed loop. The tracking controller is validated in a simulation that
considers the actual growth of a Gallium arsenide single crystal.

change near each of the detected changes. By defining the p-value for the test
appropriately, so that it is conditional on the information used to choose the
test, this approach will produce valid p-values. We show how to improve the
power of these procedures by conditioning on less information. This gives rise
to an ideal selective p-value that is intractable but can be approximated by
Monte Carlo. We show that for any Monte Carlo sample size, this procedure
produces valid p-values, and empirically that noticeable increase in power is
possible with only very modest Monte Carlo sample sizes. Our procedure is easy
to implement given existing post-selection inference methods, as we just need
to generate perturbations of the data set and re-apply the post-selection

terms of the extent to which socio-spatial networks shaped by human mobility
exacerbate or alleviate urban heat exposures of populations in cities. In this
study, we utilize location-based data to construct human mobility networks in
twenty metropolitan areas in the U.S. The human mobility networks are analyzed
in conjunction with the urban heat characteristics of spatial areas. We
identify areas with high and low urban heat exposure and evaluate visitation
patterns of populations residing in high and low urban heat areas to other
spatial areas with similar and dissimilar urban heat exposure. The results
reveal the presence of urban heat traps in the majority of the studied
metropolitan areas in which populations residing in high heat exposure areas
primarily visit areas with high heat exposure. The results also show a small
percentage of human mobility to produce urban heat escalate (visitations from
low heat areas to high heat areas) and heat escapes (movements from high heat
areas to low heat areas). The findings from this study provide a better
understanding of urban heat exposure in cities based on patterns of human

is relatively scarce, due, in part, to a gap in understanding both the data
requirements needed to fit SVC SDMs, as well as the inferential benefits of
applying a more complex modeling framework. Using simulations, we present
guidelines and recommendations for fitting single-season and multi-season SVC
SDMs. We display the inferential benefits of SVC SDMs using an empirical case
study assessing spatially-varying trends of 51 forest birds in the eastern US
from 2000-2019. We provide user-friendly and computationally efficient software
to fit SVC SDMs in the spOccupancy R package. While all datasets are unique, we
recommend a minimum sample size of ${\sim}500$ spatial locations when fitting
single-season SVC SDMs, while for multi-season SVC SDMs, ${\sim}100$ sites is
adequate for even moderate amounts of temporal replication. Within our case
study, we found 88% (45 of 51) of species had strong support for
spatially-varying occurrence trends. We suggest five guidelines: (1) only fit
single-season SVC SDMs with more than ${\sim}500$ sites; (2) consider using
informative priors on spatial parameters to improve spatial process estimates;
(3) use data from multiple seasons if available; (4) use model selection to
compare SVC SDMs with simpler alternatives; and (5) develop simulations to
assess the reliability of inferences. These guidelines provide a comprehensive
foundation for using SVC SDMs to evaluate the presence and impact of
nonstationary environmental factors that drive species distributions at

behaves very differently from SL. This paper builds on the existing approach of
MT in order to propose a framework, RLMutation, for MT applied to RL. Notably,
we use existing taxonomies of faults to build a set of mutation operators
relevant to RL and use a simple heuristic to generate test cases for RL. This
allows us to compare different mutation killing definitions based on existing

the extent to which they adjusted their threat model over space (when enabling
clients on new platforms, such as desktop clients) and time (as new threats
emerged). We experimented with short-lived adversarial access against these
desktop clients and analyzed the results with respect to two popular threat
elicitation frameworks, STRIDE and LINDDUN. The results demonstrate that system
designers need to both recognise the threats in the evolving context within
which systems operate and, more importantly, to mitigate them by rescoping
trust boundaries in a manner that those within the administrative boundary
cannot violate security and privacy properties. Such a nuanced understanding of
trust boundary scopes and their relationship with administrative boundaries
allows for better administration of shared components, including securing them
with safe defaults.

streaming algorithms. Following much research, there are now almost matching
upper and lower bounds for the trade-off needed between the number of samples
and the space complexity of the algorithm, when the data streams are
adversarial. However, in the case where the data stream is given in a random
order, or is stochastic, only weaker lower bounds exist. In this work we close
this gap, up to logarithmic factors.
  In order to do so we consider the needle problem, which is a natural hard
problem for frequency estimation studied in (Andoni et al. 2008, Crouch et al.
2016). Here, the goal is to distinguish between two distributions over data
streams with $t$ samples. The first is uniform over a large enough domain. The
second is a planted model; a secret ''needle'' is uniformly chosen, and then
each element in the stream equals the needle with probability $p$, and
otherwise is uniformly chosen from the domain. It is simple to design streaming
algorithms that distinguish the distributions using space $s \approx 1/(p^2
t)$. It was unclear if this is tight, as the existing lower bounds are weaker.
We close this gap and show that the trade-off is near optimal, up to a
logarithmic factor.
  Our proof builds and extends classical connections between streaming
algorithms and communication complexity, concretely multi-party unique
set-disjointness. We introduce two new ingredients that allow us to prove sharp
bounds. The first is a lower bound for an asymmetric version of multi-party
unique set-disjointness, where players receive input sets of different sizes,
and where the communication of each player is normalized relative to their
input length. The second is a combinatorial technique that allows to sample
needles in the planted model by first sampling intervals, and then sampling a
uniform needle in each interval.

distinctiveness that can be usefully applied and compared across languages and
times. Our first method is based on bootstrap distances between 3-gram
probability distributions, the second (reminiscent of 'unmasking' techniques)
on word keyness curves. Both methods are validated and explored by applying
them to a reasonably large corpus (a subset of DraCor): we analyse 3301
characters drawn from 2324 works, covering five centuries and four languages
(French, German, Russian, and the works of Shakespeare). Both methods appear
useful; the 3-gram method is statistically more powerful but the word keyness
method offers rich interpretability. Both methods are able to capture
phonological differences such as accent or dialect, as well as broad
differences in topic and lexical richness. Based on exploratory analysis, we
find that smaller characters tend to be more distinctive, and that women are
cross-linguistically more distinctive than men, with this latter finding
carefully interrogated using multiple regression. This greater distinctiveness
stems from a historical tendency for female characters to be restricted to an
'internal narrative domain' covering mainly direct discourse and
family/romantic themes. It is hoped that direct, comparable statistical
measures will form a basis for more sophisticated future studies, and advances
in theory.

inference methods, is uniquely identified by the Shannon-Khinchin or
Shore-Johnson axioms. Generalizations of Shannon entropy, motivated by the
study of non-extensive or non-ergodic systems, relax some of these axioms and
lead to entropy families indexed by certain `entropic' parameters. In general,
the selection of these parameters requires pre-knowledge of the system or
encounters inconsistencies. Here we introduce a simple axiom for any entropy
family: namely, that no entropic parameter can be inferred from a completely
uninformative (uniform) probability distribution. When applied to the
Uffink-Jizba-Korbel and Hanel-Thurner entropies, the axiom selects only R\'enyi
entropy as viable. It also extends consistency with the Maximum Likelihood
principle, which can then be generalized to estimate the entropic parameter
purely from data, as we confirm numerically. Remarkably, in a generalized
maximum-entropy framework the axiom implies that the maximized log-likelihood
always equals minus Shannon entropy, even if the inferred probability
distribution maximizes a generalized entropy and not Shannon's, solving a
series of problems encountered in previous approaches.

be small, with mass ratio ~ a few $\times 10^{-6}$ to the protoplanet. These
masses and the corresponding millimetre opacities are in line with CPD fluxes

reducing the computational cost of industrial thermal striping applications.
The framework aims to efficiently identify the flow features and utilize them
in spatiotemporal field predictions with a limited number of full-order
simulations. In a parameterized system, the classical projection-based
surrogates often suffer from Kolmogorov n-width limitations and have limited
reducibility in highly-nonlinear systems. A two-level machine learning
framework is proposed based on physics to address this issue. The selection of
machine learning algorithms and information extraction is empowered by the idea
that the thermal striping phenomenon is driven by large turbulent coherent flow
structures. In the first level, the turbulence coherent structures are
identified and collected by performing Proper Orthogonal Decomposition on local
parameters. A tree-based machine-learning model is then used to down-select the
reference structures based on the physical meaning of the modes. In the second
level, the reference structure information is broken down into pointwise local
points for training a deep structure corrector, which corrects the bias between
the locally true and reference structures. Demonstration of a selected
industrial application, triple jet, shows that the method can capture the
fluctuation frequencies and amplitudes of the spatiotemporal fields in a highly
nonlinear setting. The result shows that the prediction root-mean-squared error

characteristic polaronic signatures remain on cooling through the spin and
charge ordered states, eventually revealing a new transition near 50 K to a

dimerization. The order parameter associated with the observed local atomic
displacements and symmetry-allowed polaron spin structure in the ground state
suggests that charge ordering is driven by the crystallization of polarons,

equilibrium decay releases entropy. Starting from the minimal Standard Model
extension, motivated by the observed neutrino mass scale, with nothing more
than 3 RHN for the Seesaw mechanism, we discuss the conditions for high scale
leptogenesis assuming a thermal initial population of RHN. We further address
the associated production of potentially light non-thermal dark matter and a
potential component of dark radiation from the same RHN decay. One of our main
findings is that the frequency, above which the damping of the tensor modes is
potentially observable, is completely determined by successful leptogenesis and
a Davidson-Ibarra type bound to be at around $0.1\;\text{Hz}$. To quantify the
detection prospects of this GW background for various proposed interferometers
such as AEDGE, BBO, DECIGO, Einstein Telescope or LISA we compute the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This allows us to investigate the viable parameter
space of our model, spanned by the mass of the decaying RHN $M_1 \gtrsim
2.4\times 10^8\;\text{GeV} \cdot \sqrt{2\times 10^{-7}\;\text{eV}/\tilde{m}_1}$

of effective propagation speeds of curvature perturbations and gravitational

and inducing a modification of the friction term of the perturbations
propagation equation. The approach can be applied to dark energy, modified
gravity, dark matter, for fields of arbitrary number and spin, and is
particularly suitable for model independent analysis of observational data. The

  28 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.DS econ.EM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Estimating the empirical distribution of a scalar-valued data set is a basic
and fundamental task. In this paper, we tackle the problem of estimating an
empirical distribution in a setting with two challenging features. First, the
algorithm does not directly observe the data; instead, it only asks a limited
number of threshold queries about each sample. Second, the data are not assumed
to be independent and identically distributed; instead, we allow for an
arbitrary process generating the samples, including an adaptive adversary.
These considerations are relevant, for example, when modeling a seller
experimenting with posted prices to estimate the distribution of consumers'
willingness to pay for a product: offering a price and observing a consumer's
purchase decision is equivalent to asking a single threshold query about their
value, and the distribution of consumers' values may be non-stationary over
time, as early adopters may differ markedly from late adopters.
  Our main result quantifies, to within a constant factor, the sample
complexity of estimating the empirical CDF of a sequence of elements of $[n]$,
up to $\varepsilon$ additive error, using one threshold query per sample. The
complexity depends only logarithmically on $n$, and our result can be
interpreted as extending the existing logarithmic-complexity results for noisy
binary search to the more challenging setting where noise is non-stochastic.
Along the way to designing our algorithm, we consider a more general model in
which the algorithm is allowed to make a limited number of simultaneous
threshold queries on each sample. We solve this problem using Blackwell's
Approachability Theorem and the exponential weights method. As a side result of
independent interest, we characterize the minimum number of simultaneous
threshold queries required by deterministic CDF estimation algorithms.

characterized with three transitions: Pnma to Imma [563 K] to R-3c [673 K] to
Pm-3m [1173 K]. In contrast, thermoanalytical methods showed multiple
singularities corresponding to at-least three more structural transitions at
around 830 K, 900 K, and 1030 K. In account of these conflicting experimental
findings, we computed free energy phase diagram for BaCeO3 employing crystal
structure data mining in conjunction with first principles electronic structure
and phonon lattice dynamics. A total of 34 polymorphs have been predicted, the
most stable of which follows the Glazer classification of the perovskite tilt
system. It has been predicted that the Cmcm and P4/mbm phases surpass Pnma at
666 K and 1210 K, respectively. At any temperature, two alternate tetragonal
phases (P42/nmc and I4/mcm) are also found to be 20 to 30 meV less favored than
the Pnma. While the calculated stability order of the predicted polymorphs is
in acceptable agreement with the results of neutron diffraction, the

corrections to the coupling constant of the flavor-U(5) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
(NJL) model with degenerate up and down quarks. They break flavor and chiral
symmetries and they can be written as $G_{ij}^\Gamma (\bar{\psi} \lambda_i
\Gamma \psi) ( \bar{\psi} \lambda_j \Gamma \psi)$, for the scalar and
pseudoscalar channels($\Gamma=I , i \gamma_5$) and $i,j = 0.1,...
N_f^2-1$.Their contributions to different observables are computed:
quark-antiquark scalar condensates, masses of quark-antiquark meson states
(pseudoscalar and scalar) and pseudoscalar meson weak decay constants. The
non-covariant three-dimensional regularization scheme is employed, according to
which a three-dimensional momentum cutoff has an unique interpretation for
light and heavy quarks. Besides that, flavor dependence of cutoffs is
implemented in an unambiguous way. Their values ($\Lambda_f$, f=u,s,c,b) ,
however, are found to be very close to each other, i.e. the best results are
obtained for nearly flavor-independent cutoffs. The polarization tensor is
calculated entirely in the adjoint representation, what lead to mixing terms.
This quantum mixing effect is responsible for a lowering of quark effective
masses and a slight improvement of predictions of observables. A quite
surprisingly good description of all the pseudoscalar meson masses -- including
the pseudoscalar $\eta$'s -- and most of the scalar meson masses -- is obtained
within 5$\%$ to 10$\%$. However, the usual problems to describe the correct
mass hierarchy of some light scalar mesons still remain. In spite of the good
description of the meson masses, the pseudoscalar meson weak decay constant
cannot be described by the NJL model with relativistic heavy quark propagators
without further interactions or effects.

circuit. In this work, we introduce a multi-chip module architecture to
suppress phonon-mediated QP poisoning. Here, the SFQ elements and qubits are
fabricated on separate chips that are joined with In bump bonds. We use
interleaved randomized benchmarking to characterize the fidelity of SFQ-based

order-of-magnitude reduction over the gate error achieved in the initial
realization of SFQ-based qubit control. We use purity benchmarking to quantify
the contribution of incoherent error at 0.96(2)%; we attribute this error to
photon-mediated QP poisoning mediated by the resonant mm-wave antenna modes of
the qubit and SFQ-qubit coupler. We anticipate that a straightforward redesign
of the SFQ driver circuit to limit the bandwidth of the SFQ pulses will
eliminate this source of infidelity, allowing SFQ-based gates with fidelity
approaching theoretical limits, namely 99.9% for resonant sequences and 99.99%
for more complex pulse sequences involving variable pulse-to-pulse separation.

a first measurement of the CO(5-4) LF at <z>=5.0. The relatively large area and

carbon compared to objects in the outer Solar System, the Sun, or the ISM. It
is believed that this is a result of the selective removal of refractory carbon
from primordial circumstellar material. In this work, we study the irreversible
release of carbon into the gaseous environment via photolysis and pyrolysis of
refractory carbonaceous material during the disk phase of the early Solar
System. We analytically solve the one-dimensional advection equation and derive
an explicit expression that describes the depletion of carbonaceous material in
solids under the influence of radial and vertical transport. We find both
depletion mechanisms individually fail to reproduce Solar System abundances
under typical conditions. While radial transport only marginally restricts
photodecomposition, it is the inefficient vertical transport that limits carbon
depletion under these conditions. We show explicitly that an increase in the
vertical mixing efficiency, and/or an increase in the directly irradiated disk
volume, favors carbon depletion. Thermal decomposition requires a hot inner
disk (> 500 K) beyond 3 AU to deplete the formation region of Earth and
chondrites. We find FU Ori-type outbursts to produce these conditions such that
moderately refractory compounds are depleted. However, such outbursts likely do
not deplete the most refractory carbonaceous compounds beyond the innermost
disk region. Hence, the refractory carbon abundance at 1 AU typically does not
reach terrestrial levels. Nevertheless, under specific conditions, we find
photolysis and pyrolysis combined to reproduce Solar System abundances.

this scenario by reporting the new discovery of giant molecular clouds (GMCs)

Its CO(4-3) emission was mapped with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) at an angular resolution of $0.19''\times 0.16''$, reading down to
30~pc thanks to gravitational lensing. We identified 14 GMCs, most being
virialized, with $10^{5.9}- 10^{7.9}~M_{\odot}$ masses and a median
$800~M_{\odot}~\rm{pc}^{-2}$ molecular gas mass surface density, that are,
respectively, 100 and 10 times higher than for local GMCs. They are also
characterized by 10 times higher supersonic turbulence with a median Mach
number of 60. They end up to fall above the Larson scaling relations, similarly
to the GMCs in another clumpy $z\simeq 1$ galaxy, the Cosmic Snake, although
noteworthy differences between the two sets of high-redshift GMCs exist.
Altogether they support that GMCs form with properties that adjust to the
ambient interstellar medium conditions prevalent in the host galaxy whatever

which came to formalize reasoning with quantum circuits, measurements and

equality of diagrams under ZX-equivalent transformations lifts to an equality
of corresponding equations over matrices. Conversely, in 2014 Backens proved
completeness, establishing that any derivation done in stabilizer quantum
mechanics with matrices can be derived graphically using the ZX-calculus. A
graphical rewrite system that is both confluent and also terminates uniquely is
called canonical: Applying alternate sequences of rewrites to the same initial
diagram, a rewrite system is confluent whenever all resulting diagrams can be
manipulated to establish graphical equivalence. Here we show that a reduced
ZX-rewrite system is already confluent in the Heisenberg picture for stabilizer
quantum mechanics. Moreover, any application of a subset of ZX-rewrites
terminates uniquely and irrespective of the order of term rewrites in the
Heisenberg picture for stabilizer quantum mechanics. The ZX-system is hence
Heisenberg-canonical for stabiliser quantum mechanics. For a stabilizer circuit
on $n$-qubits with $l$ single-qubit gates and $g$ two-qubit gates, the circuit
output can be derived graphically in the Heisenberg picture using no more than
$(\frac{1}{2}\cdot g+l)\cdot n$ graphical rewrites, thereby providing a
graphical proof of the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Finally, we establish that each
stabilizer state described by a Clifford circuit gives rise to a non-negative
parent Hamiltonian with $n+1$ terms and a one-dimensional kernel spanned by the
corresponding stabilizer state. Such parent Hamiltonians can be derived with
$\mathcal{O}(t\cdot n)$ graphical rewrites for a low energy state prepared by a

about terrestrial planet formation imply transport mechanisms capable of
erasing the anticipated debris signature. A tenuous gas disk may be regenerated
via ""takeout"" (i.e., the liberation of planetary atmospheres in giant impacts)
or ""delivery"" (i.e., by asteroids and comets flung into the terrestrial planet
region) at a level sufficient to remove the warm debris. The powerful stellar
wind from a young star can also act, its delivered wind momentum producing a
drag that removes warm debris. If such processes are efficient, terrestrial
planets may assemble inconspicuously, with little publicity and hoopla
accompanying their birth. Alternatively, the rarity of warm excesses may imply
that terrestrial planets typically form very early, emerging fully formed from
the nebular phase without undergoing late-stage giant impacts. In either case,
the observable signposts of terrestrial planet formation appear more
challenging to detect than previously assumed. We discuss observational tests
of these ideas.

dispersion of $\sigma_0$ = 87 $\pm$ 6 kms$^{-1}$ for these $\textit{disc-like}$

are both faster rotating and more turbulent, but have similar $v_{\rm

are not kinematically ''cold'' discs, and that the individual components
$v_{\rm rot}$ and $\sigma_0$ indicate that they are in fact turbulent, but
rotationally supported systems in $\sim$50 per cent of cases. This turbulence
may be driven by star formation or mergers/interactions. We estimate the
normalisation of the stellar Tully-Fisher relation (sTFR) for the disc-like
DSFGs and compare it with local studies, finding no evolution at fixed slope
between $z\sim$2 and $z\sim$0. Finally, we use kinematic estimates of DSFG halo
masses to investigate the stellar-to-halo mass relation, finding our sources to
be consistent with shock heating and strong feedback which likely drives the
declining stellar content in the most massive halos.

has a field strength in excess of 10 MG, it is expected to synchronize its
rotational frequency to the binary orbit frequency, particularly at small
binary separations, due to the steep radial dependence of the magnetic field.
We report the discovery of an mCV (SDSS J134441.83+204408.3; hereafter, J1344)
that defies this expectation by displaying asynchronous rotation
($P_{spin}/P_{orb} = 0.893$) in spite of a high surface field strength (B=56
MG) and a short orbital period (114 min). Previously misidentified as a
synchronously rotating mCV, J1344 was observed by TESS during sector 50, and
the resulting power spectrum shows distinct spin and orbital frequencies, along
with various sidebands and harmonics. Although there are several other
asynchronous mCVs at short orbital periods, the presence of cyclotron humps in
J1344's SDSS spectrum makes it possible to directly measure the field strength
in the cyclotron-emitting region; a previously study estimated 65 MG based on
its identification of two cyclotron humps, but we revise this to 56$\pm$2 MG
based on the detection of a third hump and on our modeling of the cyclotron
spectrum. Short-period mCVs with field strengths above 10 MG are normally
expected to be synchronous, so the highly asynchronous rotation in J1344
presents an interesting challenge for theoretical studies of spin-period
evolution.

$0.2<z<2.5$ with stellar mass $\rm{M_*>10^{9}~M_\odot}$ using JWST MIRI
observations from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science survey (CEERS).
The MIRI bands span the MIR (7.7--21~$\mu$m), enabling us to measure the
effective radii ($R_{\rm{eff}}$) and S\'{e}rsic indexes of these SFGs at
rest-frame 6.2 and 7.7 $\mu$m, which contains strong emission from Polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features, a well-established tracer of star
formation in galaxies. We define a ``PAH-band'' as the MIRI bandpass that
contains these features at the redshift of the galaxy. We then compare the
galaxy morphologies in the PAH-bands to those in rest-frame Near-UV (NUV) using
HST ACS/F435W or ACS/F606W and optical/near-IR using HST WFC3/F160W imaging
from UVCANDELS and CANDELS, where the NUV-band and F160W trace the profile of
(unobscured) massive stars and the stellar continuum, respectively. The
$R_{\rm{eff}}$ of galaxies in the PAH-band are slightly smaller ($\sim$10\%)
than those in F160W for galaxies with $\rm{M_*\gtrsim10^{9.5}~M_\odot}$ at
$z\leq1.2$, but the PAH-band and F160W have a similar fractions of light within
1 kpc. In contrast, the $R_{\rm{eff}}$ of galaxies in the NUV-band are larger,
with lower fractions of light within 1 kpc compared to F160W for galaxies at

density, we find the correlation between the $\rm{SFR_{\rm{IR}}}$ surface
density and stellar mass has a steeper slope than that of the
$\rm{SFR_{\rm{UV}}}$ surface density and stellar mass, suggesting more massive
galaxies having increasing amounts of obscured fraction of star formation in

results of low-fidelity (fast but inaccurate) and high-fidelity (slow but
accurate) simulations. Despite the fast developments of multi-fidelity fusion
techniques, most existing methods require particular data structures and do not
scale well to high-dimensional output. To resolve these issues, we generalize
the classic autoregression (AR), which is wildly used due to its simplicity,
robustness, accuracy, and tractability, and propose generalized autoregression
(GAR) using tensor formulation and latent features. GAR can deal with arbitrary
dimensional outputs and arbitrary multifidelity data structure to satisfy the
demand of multi-fidelity fusion for complex problems; it admits a fully
tractable likelihood and posterior requiring no approximate inference and
scales well to high-dimensional problems. Furthermore, we prove the
autokrigeability theorem based on GAR in the multi-fidelity case and develop
CIGAR, a simplified GAR with the exact predictive mean accuracy with
computation reduction by a factor of d 3, where d is the dimensionality of the
output. The empirical assessment includes many canonical PDEs and real

properties of an atmosphere, polarimetry will be an important tool that, in
tandem with traditional flux-only observations, will enhance the capabilities
of characterizing Earth-like planets. In this paper we benchmark two different
polarization-enabled radiative-transfer codes against each other and against
unique linear spectropolarimetric observations of the earthshine that cover
wavelengths from $\sim$0.4 to $\sim$2.3 $\mu$m. We find that while the results
from the two codes generally agree with each other, there is a phase dependency
between the compared models. Additionally, with our current assumptions, the
models from both codes underestimate the level of polarization of the
earthshine. We also report an interesting discrepancy between our models and
the observed 1.27 $\mu$m $O_2$ feature in the earthshine, and provide an
analysis of potential methods for matching this feature. Our results suggest
that only having access to the 1.27 $\mu$m $O_2$ feature coupled with a lack of

dependence of this time-scale in the Galaxy. Since the infall rate depends on
that time scale in the CEM, the results of the model were used to test a
scenario where the bulge is formed inside-out. The obtained results for the
$[\alpha/\mbox{Fe}]$ vs. [Fe/H] relationship, the MDF and the [Fe/H] radial
gradient in the bulge have been compared to available data in the literature.
The model is able to reproduce most of the observational data: the spread in
the relation $[\alpha/\mbox{Fe}]$ vs. [Fe/H], the MDF shape in different
regions of the bulge, the [Fe/H] radial gradient inside it and the
age-metallicity relation, as well as the [$\alpha$/Fe] evolution with age. The
results of the model point to a scenario where the bulk of the bulge stars
pre-existed the boxy/peanut X-shape bar formation. As a result, the classical
origin of the GB is not ruled out and this scenario may be invoked to explain
the chemical properties of the Galactic bulge.

which aims to find paths with the lowest exhaust emissions or energy need. The
challenges of this problem are three-fold: (1) the dependence of a vehicle's
eco-toll on its physical parameters; (2) the lack of access to data with
eco-toll information; and (3) the influence of contextual information (i.e. the

Prior work on eco-toll estimation has mostly relied on pure data-driven
approaches and has high estimation errors given the limited training data. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel Eco-toll estimation
Physics-informed Neural Network framework (Eco-PiNN) using three novel ideas,
namely, (1) a physics-informed decoder that integrates the physical laws of the
vehicle engine into the network, (2) an attention-based contextual information
encoder, and (3) a physics-informed regularization to reduce overfitting.
Experiments on real-world heavy-duty truck data show that the proposed method

multicore architectures. Reasoning about the fine-grained complexities
(interleavings, invariants, etc.) of those data structures, however, is
notoriously difficult. Formal proof methodologies for arguing about the
correctness -- i.e.,~linearizability -- of these data structures are still
somewhat disconnected from the intuitive correctness arguments. Intuitions are
often about a few canonical executions, possibly with few threads, whereas
formal proofs would often use generic but complex arguments about arbitrary

  As a way to bring formal proofs closer to intuitive arguments, we introduce a
new methodology for characterizing the interleavings of concurrent objects,
based on their \emph{commutativity quotient}. This quotient represents every
interleaving up to reordering of commutative steps and, when chosen carefully,
admits simple abstractions in the form of regular or context-free languages
that enable simple proofs of linearizability. We demonstrate these facts on a

when the inferential goal is estimating regression coefficients, and various

apparent that many of these methodologies are flawed, yet the field continues

these as the analysis model and the data generation types of spatial

cases, traditional spatial linear mixed models do help to improve inference of
regression coefficients. Drawing on the insights gained, we offer a path

differences in the 50 pc case. We find a greater discrepancy in the modeled
sea-level muon radiation dose, with significantly smaller dose values in the 50
pc case; our results indicate it is unlikely that muon radiation is a
significant threat to the biosphere for SNe beyond at least 20 pc. We have also
performed new modeling of effects by SNe at 20 pc and 10 pc. Overall, our
results indicate that, considering only effects of SN CRs, the ""lethal"" SN
distance may be closer to 20 pc rather than the typically quoted 8-10 pc.

consensus that the distribution of circuits among processing agents is a viable
approach to get greater scalability with small machines. This approach can
increase the combined computational power at the cost of dedicating qubits to
get the communication between partitions. Then comes the challenge of reducing
this cost of communication-based on efficient circuit partitioning strategies.
In this context, this work aims to reduce the consumption of communication
qubits generated during the physical partitioning of quantum circuits in the
distributed quantum computing scenario. We present a new method for
partitioning quantum circuits in a hypergraphic representation, using a
heuristic partitioning algorithm for this, reducing the number of communication
qubits between the partitions. With this approach, we obtained partial results
with a more than 50% reduction in the communication cost generated for the
bipartite partitioning against a process done randomly on benchmark circuits.
The expectation is that future experiments with multiple partitions will
continue with equal or better results than previous works, supporting
distributed quantum computing with machines in heterogeneous processing and
communication scenarios.

configuration in buffet conditions using hybrid RANS/LES simulations with the
Automated Zonal Detached Eddy Simulation (AZDES) method. The analyzed
configuration consists of two untapered and unswept wing segments,
representative of a wing-tail plane configuration. The shock oscillation on the
front wing segment and the development of its turbulent wake are characterized,
including a spectral analysis of the pressure and velocity fluctuations in the
wake and a modal analysis of the flow field applying Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD). The impact of the wake on the aerodynamics and loads of
the rear wing segment is then studied, with a spectral analysis of its lift and
surface pressure oscillations. Finally, the influence of the position and the
incidence angle of the rear wing segment are investigated. For the considered
flow conditions, 2D buffet is present on the front wing segment. During the
downstream movement of the shock, the amount of separation reaches its minimum
and small vortices are present in the wake. During the upstream movement of the
shock, the amount of separation is at its maximum and larger turbulent
structures are present together with high fluctuation levels of velocity and
pressure. A distinct peak can be associated with the meandering motion of wake
vortices, identified by means of a modal analysis of the flow field using
Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. The impingement of the wake causes a strong
variation of the loading of the rear wing segment. A comparably low-frequent
oscillation of the lift coefficient, attributed to the change of intensity of
the downwash caused by the front segment, can be distinguished from
fluctuations of high frequency that are caused by the impingement of the
turbulent structures in the wake.

existing research has not adequately explored the impact from a time-evolving

study investigates in a wind tunnel the effects of tree-to-canyon foliage cover
and relative height (0.32-1.1 times canyon height), mimicking growth of trees,
on conditions in street canyons during moderate and extreme heat. The results
reveal that trees may affect canyon-wide ventilation and heat removal in two
different scenarios. First, when canyons are in isothermal conditions, medium
and large trees, that fill half the canyon height or reach slightly above the
canyon, decelerate the shear layer and weaken the vortical flow, as a result
reducing the canyon-wide ventilation. Second, in extreme heat conditions,
medium and large trees trap heat at the pedestrian level due to the blockage of
air entrainment and the suppression of upward buoyancy-driven flow from the
ground surface. An air temperature rise that corresponds to 1.5 degree Celsius
in a full-scale urban setting is observed in measurements. These observations
suggest that urban trees' foliage cover must be managed for a canyon's optimal
ventilation and heat removal during nighttime.

radiography systems enable a rough elemental analysis of cargo containers due
to the $Z$-dependence of photon attenuation, allowing for improved material
detection. This work studies the theoretical capabilities for atomic number
discrimination using dual energy systems by considering three case studies:
dual energy $\{6, 4\}$ MeV bremsstrahlung beams, dual energy $\{10, 6\}$ MeV
bremsstrahlung beams, and dual energy $\{10, 4\}$ MeV bremsstrahlung beams.
Results of this analysis show that two different materials can sometimes
produce identical measurements due to competition between photoelectric
absorption and pair production, leading to a fundamental ambiguity when
differentiating between materials of vastly different atomic numbers. This
non-uniqueness property is present at low area densities and at high-$Z$.
Furthermore, this analysis suggests that atomic number discrimination becomes
significantly more challenging as atomic number increases. The dual energy
$\{10, 4\}$ MeV bremsstrahlung case study showed significantly improved atomic
number discrimination capabilities compared to the dual energy $\{10, 6\}$ MeV
and $\{6, 4\}$ MeV case studies due to the increased prevalence of pair
production in the high energy beam when compared to the low energy beam.

much stronger surface affinity than do the bicarbonate anions. Molecular
dynamics simulation reveals that strong ion pairing of $CO_3^{2-}$ with the
$Na^+$ counter-cation in the interfacial region, resulting in formation of
near-neutral agglomerates of $Na^+$ and $CO_3^{2-}$ clusters, is responsible
for this counterintuitive behavior. These findings not only advance our

memory budget: in each incremental phase, learning is done for new data, most
of which is abandoned to free space for the next phase. The preserved data are
exemplars used for replaying. However, existing methods use a static and ad hoc
strategy for memory allocation, which is often sub-optimal. In this work, we
propose a dynamic memory management strategy that is optimized for the
incremental phases and different object classes. We call our method reinforced
memory management (RMM), leveraging reinforcement learning. RMM training is not
naturally compatible with CIL as the past, and future data are strictly
non-accessible during the incremental phases. We solve this by training the
policy function of RMM on pseudo CIL tasks, e.g., the tasks built on the data
of the 0-th phase, and then applying it to target tasks. RMM propagates two
levels of actions: Level-1 determines how to split the memory between old and
new classes, and Level-2 allocates memory for each specific class. In essence,
it is an optimizable and general method for memory management that can be used
in any replaying-based CIL method. For evaluation, we plug RMM into two
top-performing baselines (LUCIR+AANets and POD+AANets [30]) and conduct
experiments on three benchmarks (CIFAR-100, ImageNet-Subset, and
ImageNet-Full). Our results show clear improvements, e.g., boosting POD+AANets

Current algorithms which combine object detection with sky estimation

at the faint end and destroying or severely compromising low surface brightness
light. While it has recently been shown that properly accounting for undetected
faint galaxies and the wings of brighter objects can in principle recover a
more accurate sky estimate, this has not yet been demonstrated in practice.
Obtaining a consistent spatially smooth underlying sky estimate is particularly
challenging in the presence of representative distributions of bright and faint
objects. In this paper we use simulations of crowded and uncrowded fields
designed to mimic Hyper Suprime-Cam data to perform a series of tests on the
accuracy of the recovered sky. Dependence on field density, galaxy type and
limiting flux for detection are all considered. Several photometry packages are

and investigates regulatory policies that promote the spatial and social equity
in future autonomous mobility ecosystems. To this end, we consider a multimodal
transportation network, where a ride-hailing platform operates a fleet of AVs
to offer mobility-on-demand services in competition with a public transit
agency that offers transit services on a transportation network. A
game-theoretic model is developed to characterize the intimate interactions
between the ride-hailing platform, the transit agency, and multiclass
passengers with distinct income levels. An algorithm is proposed to compute the
Nash equilibrium of the game and conduct an ex-post evaluation of the
performance of the obtained solution. Based on the proposed framework, we
evaluate the spatial and social equity in transport accessibility using Theil
index, and find that although the proliferation of for-hire AVs in the
ride-hailing network improves overall accessibility, the benefits are not
fairly distributed among distinct locations or population groups, implying that
the deployment of AVs will enlarge the existing spatial and social inequity
gaps in the transportation network if no regulatory intervention is in place.
To address this concern, we investigate two regulatory policies that can
improve transport equity: (a) a minimum service-level requirement on
ride-hailing service, which improves the spatial equity in the transport
network; (b) a subsidy on ride-hailing trips that serve as first/last-mile
connection to public transit, which promotes the use of public transit and
improves the social equity of the transport network. We show that the minimum
service-level requirement entails a trade-off: as a higher minimum service
level is imposed, the spatial inequity reduces, but the social inequity will be
exacerbated. In contrast...

Polyak's original algorithm remains simpler and more widely used in
applications such as deep learning. Despite this popularity, the question of
whether Heavy-ball is also globally accelerated or not has not been fully
answered yet, and no convincing counterexample has been provided. This is
largely due to the difficulty in finding an effective Lyapunov function:
indeed, most proofs of Heavy-ball acceleration in the strongly-convex quadratic
setting rely on eigenvalue arguments. Our study adopts a different approach:
studying momentum through the lens of quadratic invariants of simple harmonic
oscillators. By utilizing the modified Hamiltonian of Stormer-Verlet
integrators, we are able to construct a Lyapunov function that demonstrates an
O(1/k^2) rate for Heavy-ball in the case of convex quadratic problems. This is
a promising first step towards potentially proving the acceleration of Polyak's

sign detection model which emphasizes performance on salient signs, or signs
that influence the decisions of a driver. We define a traffic sign salience
property and use it to construct the LAVA Salient Signs Dataset, the first
traffic sign dataset that includes an annotated salience property. Next, we use
a custom salience loss function, Salience-Sensitive Focal Loss, to train a
Deformable DETR object detection model in order to emphasize stronger

Salience-Sensitive Focal Loss outperforms a model trained without, with regards
to recall of both salient signs and all signs combined. Further, the
performance margin on salient signs compared to all signs is largest for the
model trained with Salience-Sensitive Focal Loss.

  Dynamics","8 pages, 10 figures, preprint",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectral bias is an important observation of neural network training, stating
that the network will learn a low frequency representation of the target
function before converging to higher frequency components. This property is
interesting due to its link to good generalization in over-parameterized
networks. However, in low dimensional settings, a severe spectral bias occurs
that obstructs convergence to high frequency components entirely. In order to
overcome this limitation, one can encode the inputs using a high frequency
sinusoidal encoding. Previous works attempted to explain this phenomenon using
Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) and Fourier analysis. However, NTK does not capture
real network dynamics, and Fourier analysis only offers a global perspective on
the network properties that induce this bias. In this paper, we provide a novel
approach towards understanding spectral bias by directly studying ReLU MLP
training dynamics. Specifically, we focus on the connection between the
computations of ReLU networks (activation regions), and the speed of gradient
descent convergence. We study these dynamics in relation to the spatial
information of the signal to understand how they influence spectral bias. We
then use this formulation to study the severity of spectral bias in low
dimensional settings, and how positional encoding overcomes this.

study are used to propose a potential mitigation strategy based on ventilation

enclosed indoor spaces. Our findings demonstrate that as the ventilation rate
(Qv) increases, the efficiency of removing airborne particles (Ep) initially
increases rapidly, reaches a plateau (Ep,c) at a critical ventilation rate
(Qc), and subsequently increases at a slower rate beyond Qc. The Qc for
low-ceiling rooms is lower compared to high-ceiling rooms due to the increased
interaction between the thermal plume generated by the occupants or infectors
and the ventilation. Further analysis of the flow and temperature fields
reveals that Ep is closely linked to the thermal stratification fields, as
characterized by the thermal interface height, the height of the temperature
isosurface, and temperature gradient. The simulations also indicate that the
location of infector relative to ventilation inlet/outlet affects Qc and Ep,c
with higher Qc and lower Ep,c observed when infector is in a corner due to
potential formation of a local hot spot of high infection risk when infector is
near the ventilation inlet. In conclusion, based on the simulations, we propose
a ventilation thermal control strategy, by increasing the ventilation

multiplication and division of long integers, can be used to mental arithmetic
and to computer science. In this paper, we improve the theory of plum-blossom
products so that the new concept--the plum-blossom wedge product is proposed.
The plum-blossom wedge product is also of some good features so that it can be
applied to multiplication and division of long integers. The plum-blossom wedge
product method of multiplication and division is not only efficient in mental

of the sub-Alfv\'enic wind observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), and the
morphology of the Alfv\'enic transition, all of which are key issues in solar
wind research. First we highlight a special structure in the pristine solar
wind, termed a low Mach-number boundary layer (LMBL). An increased Alfv\'en
radius and suppressed SBs are observed within an LMBL. A probable source on the
Sun for an LMBL is the peripheral region inside a coronal hole with rapidly
diverging open fields. The sub-Alfv\'enic wind detected by PSP is an LMBL flow
by nature. The similar origin and similar properties of the sub-Alfv\'enic
intervals favor a wrinkled surface for the morphology of the Alfv\'enic
transition. We find that a larger deflection angle tends to be associated with
a higher Alfv\'en Mach number. The magnetic deflections have an origin well
below the Alfv\'en critical point, and deflection angles larger than
$90^{\circ}$ seem to occur only when $M_{\rm A} \gtrsim 2$. The velocity
enhancement in units of the local Alfv\'en speed generally increases with the
deflection angle, which is explained by a simple model. A nonlinearly evolved,
saturated state is revealed for SBs, where the local Alfv\'en speed is roughly
an upper bound for the velocity enhancement. In the context of these results,
the most promising theory on the origin of SBs is the model of expanding waves
and turbulence, and the patchy distribution of SBs is attributed to modulation
by reductions in the Alfv\'en Mach number. Finally, a picture on the generation
and evolution of SBs is created based on the results.

the brain continuously predicts its inputs and adapts to model its own dynamics

has rarely been discussed. Therefore, in this paper, we clarify the
definitions, relationships, and status of current research on these topics, as
well as missing pieces of world models and predictive coding in conjunction
with crucially related concepts such as the free-energy principle and active
inference in the context of cognitive and developmental robotics. Furthermore,

coding toward the further integration of AI and robotics, as well as the
creation of robots with real cognitive and developmental capabilities in the

lead to high-quality correspondences even in challenging cases such as sparse

observation is that, in line with neural priors observed in other domains,
recent network architectures on 3D data, even without training, tend to produce
pointwise features that induce plausible maps between rigid or non-rigid
shapes. Secondly, we show that given a noisy map as input, training a feature
extraction network with the input map as supervision tends to remove artifacts
from the input and can act as a powerful correspondence denoising mechanism,
both between individual pairs and within a collection. With these observations
in hand, we propose a two-stage unsupervised paradigm for shape matching by (i)
performing unsupervised training by adapting an existing approach to obtain an
initial set of noisy matches, and (ii) using these matches to train a network
in a supervised manner. We demonstrate that this approach significantly
improves the accuracy of the maps, especially when trained within a collection.

cues play an important role in current data-driven single-view depth estimation

surroundings utilizing the equirectangular projection which introduces large
distortion. This requires the depth estimation method to be able to handle the

paper, we propose an end-to-end deep network for monocular panorama depth
estimation on a unit spherical surface. Specifically, we project the feature
maps extracted from equirectangular images onto unit spherical surface sampled
by uniformly distributed grids, where the decoder network can aggregate the
information from the distortion-reduced feature maps. Meanwhile, we propose a
global cross-attention-based fusion module to fuse the feature maps from skip

$f(x,\sin{x}, \cos{x})$ with $f\in\mathbb{Q}[x_1,x_2,x_3]$. In this paper, an
algorithm ``isolating"" all the real roots of an MTP is provided and
implemented. It automatically divides the real roots into two parts: one
consists of finitely many ``bounded"" roots in an interval $[\mu_-,\mu_+]$ while
the other consists of probably countably many ``periodic"" roots in
$\mathbb{R}\backslash[\mu_-,\mu_+]$. For bounded roots, the algorithm returns
isolating intervals and corresponding multiplicities while for periodic roots,
it returns finitely many mutually disjoint small intervals
$I_i\subset[-\pi,\pi]$, integers $c_i>0$ and multisets of root multiplicity
$\{m_{j,i}\}_{j=1}^{c_i}$ such that any periodic root $t>\mu_+$ is in the set
$(\sqcup_i\cup_{k\in\mathbb{N}}(I_i+2k\pi))$ and any interval
$I_i+2k\pi\subset(\mu_+,\infty)$ contains exactly $c_i$ periodic roots with
multiplicities $m_{1,i},...,m_{c_i,i}$, respectively. The effectiveness and
efficiency of the algorithm are shown by experiments. %In particular, our
results indicate that the ``distributions"" of the roots of an MTP in the
``periods"" $(-\pi,\pi]+2k\pi$ sufficiently far from $0$ share a same pattern.
Besides, the method used to isolate the roots in $[\mu_-,\mu_+]$ is applicable
to any other bounded interval as well. The algorithm takes advantages of the
weak Fourier sequence technique and deals with the intervals period-by-period
without scaling the coordinate so to keep the length of the sequence short. The
new approaches can easily be modified to decide whether there is any root, or
whether there are infinitely many roots in unbounded intervals of the form
$(-\infty,a)$ or $(a,\infty)$ with $a\in\mathbb{Q}$.

identification of the quaternary Heusler alloy, CoRuVSi as a new member of the
recently discovered spin semimetals class. Spin polarised semimetals possess a
unique band structure in which one of the spin bands shows semimetallic nature,
while the other shows semiconducting/insulating nature. Our findings show that
CoRuVSi possesses interesting spintronic and thermoelectric properties.
Magnetization data reveal a weak ferri-/antiferro magnetic ordering at low
temperatures, with only a very small moment $\sim$ 0.13 $\mu_B$/f.u.,
attributed to the disorder. Transport results provide strong evidence of
semimetallicity dominated by two-band conduction, while magnetoresistance data
show a non-saturating, linear, positive, magnetoresistance. Spin polarization
measurements using point-contact Andreev reflection spectra reveal a reasonably
high spin polarization of $\sim$ 50\%, which matches fairly well with the
simulated result. Furthermore, CoRuVSi shows a high thermopower value of $0.7$
$m Watt/ m-K^{2}$ at room temperature with the dominant contribution from the
semimetallic bands, rendering it as a promising thermoelectric material as
well. Our ab-initio simulation not only confirms a unique semimetallic feature,
but also reveals that the band structure hosts a linear band crossing at $\sim$
-0.4 eV below the Fermi level incorporated by a band-inversion. In addition,
the observed topological non-trivial features of the band structure is
corroborated with the simulated Berry curvature, intrinsic anomalous Hall
conductivity and the Fermi surface. The coexistence of many interesting
properties relevant for spintronic, topological and thermoelectric applications
in a single material is extremely rare and hence this study could promote a
similar strategy to identify other potential materials belonging to same class.

(CNN) based detectors to determine positive or negative samples during training

consider the characteristics of targets in remote sensing images thoroughly,
such as large variations in orientations, aspect ratios and scales, which lead
to insufficient sampling. In this paper, an Elliptical Distribution aided
Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment (EARL) is proposed to select positive
samples with higher quality in orientation detectors, and yields better
performance. Concretely, to avoid inadequate sampling of targets with extreme
scales, an adaptive scale sampling (ADS) strategy is proposed to dynamically
select samples on different feature levels according to the scales of targets.
To enhance ADS, positive samples are selected following a dynamic elliptical
distribution (DED), which can further exploit the orientation and shape
properties of targets. Moreover, a spatial distance weighting (SDW) module is
introduced to mitigate the influence from low-quality samples on detection
performance. Extensive experiments on popular remote sensing datasets, such as
DOTA and HRSC2016, demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of our
proposed EARL, where without bells and whistles, it achieves 72.87 of mAP on

queries arriving during the snapshot period because fork leads the engine into
the kernel mode in which the engine is out-of-service for queries. In contrast
to existing research focusing on optimizing snapshot algorithms, we optimize
the fork operation to address the latency spikes problem from the operating
system (OS) level, while keeping the data persistent mechanism in IMKVSes
unchanged. Specifically, we first conduct an in-depth study to reveal the
impact of the fork operation as well as the optimization techniques on query

work of copying the page table from the engine (the parent process) to the
child process as copying the page table dominates the execution time of fork.
To keep data consistent between the parent and the child, we design the
proactive synchronization strategy. Async-fork is implemented in the Linux

features (CQT-MSF) for speech emotion recognition (SER). The human perception
and analysis of sound comprise of two important cognitive parts: early auditory
analysis and cortex-based processing. The early auditory analysis considers
spectrogram-based representation whereas cortex-based analysis includes
extraction of temporal modulations from the spectrogram. This temporal
modulation representation of spectrogram is called modulation spectral feature
(MSF). As the constant-Q transform (CQT) provides higher resolution at emotion
salient low-frequency regions of speech, we find that CQT-based spectrogram,
together with its temporal modulations, provides a representation enriched with
emotion-specific information. We argue that CQT-MSF when used with a
2-dimensional convolutional network can provide a time-shift invariant and
deformation insensitive representation for SER. Our results show that CQT-MSF
outperforms standard mel-scale based spectrogram and its modulation features on
two popular SER databases, Berlin EmoDB and RAVDESS. We also show that our
proposed feature outperforms the shift and deformation invariant scattering
transform coefficients, hence, showing the importance of joint hand-crafted and
self-learned feature extraction instead of reliance on complete hand-crafted
features. Finally, we perform Grad-CAM analysis to visually inspect the

for shock-avoiding slices it vanishes, leading to harmonic oscillation. In

states, such as the electronic Kagome lattice, provide an ideal platform to
study the exotic quantum properties. However, the real-space investigations on
the correlated electronic Kagome lattice have been rarely reported. Herein, we
report on the electronic Kagome lattice emerging in the correlated
charge-density-wave (CDW) state of 1T-TaS$_2$ at ~200 K via
variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (VT-STM). This emergent
Kagome lattice can be considered a fractional electron-filling superstructure
with reduced translational and rotational symmetries, confirmed by STM
measurements and density functional theory simulations. The characteristic band
structure and density of states of this electronic Kagome lattice are further
explored based on theoretical calculations. Our results demonstrate a
self-organized electronic Kagome lattice from the correlated CDW state via the
effective tuning parameter of temperature and provide a platform to directly
explore the interplay of correlated electrons and topological physics.

Traditional Monte Carlo methods are often inefficient at handling several

dependent regularization parameter-maps for variational image reconstruction,
focusing on total variation (TV)-minimization. Our approach is inspired by
recent developments in algorithm unrolling using deep neural networks (NNs),
and relies on two distinct sub-networks. The first sub-network estimates the
regularization parameter-map from the input data. The second sub-network
unrolls $T$ iterations of an iterative algorithm which approximately solves the
corresponding TV-minimization problem incorporating the previously estimated
regularization parameter-map. The overall network is trained end-to-end in a
supervised learning fashion using pairs of clean-corrupted data but crucially
without the need of having access to labels for the optimal regularization
parameter-maps. We prove consistency of the unrolled scheme by showing that the
unrolled energy functional used for the supervised learning $\Gamma$-converges
as $T$ tends to infinity, to the corresponding functional that incorporates the
exact solution map of the TV-minimization problem. We apply and evaluate our
method on a variety of large scale and dynamic imaging problems in which the
automatic computation of such parameters has been so far challenging: 2D
dynamic cardiac MRI reconstruction, quantitative brain MRI reconstruction,
low-dose CT and dynamic image denoising. The proposed method consistently
improves the TV-reconstructions using scalar parameters and the obtained
parameter-maps adapt well to each imaging problem and data by leading to the
preservation of detailed features. Although the choice of the regularization
parameter-maps is data-driven and based on NNs, the proposed algorithm is
entirely interpretable since it inherits the properties of the respective
iterative reconstruction method from which the network is implicitly defined.

includes a generic ultra-high bypass ratio (UHBR) engine nacelle geometry and
one without an engine, which is denoted the baseline case. The introduction of
the UHBR-engine nacelle leads to a significant deviation of the flow onto the
airfoil from the baseline case and has an essential effect on the occurring
shock dynamics. The flow field of the nacelle configuration is characterized by
a shock wave on the upper part of the nacelle sharing dynamic features with the
shock on the airfoil. This impact of the nacelle shock on the airfoil shock
means a reduced strength of the airfoil shock resulting in a less developed
buffet. The perturbation of the general flow field is evaluated as to
established buffet models and the dynamic features of the shock waves are
analyzed by the sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition. This analysis
shows the existence of a shared dynamic mode of the nacelle and the airfoil

microscopic degrees of freedom. Photoexcitation of such materials can drive
them into new transient and long-lived hidden phases that may not have any
counterparts in equilibrium. By exploiting femtosecond time- and angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy, we probe the photoinduced transient phase and the
recovery dynamics of the ground state in a complex material: the charge density
wave (CDW)-Mott insulator 1$T$-TaS$_2$. We reveal striking similarities between
the band structures of the transient phase and the (equilibrium) structurally
undistorted metallic phase, with evidence for the coexistence of the
low-temperature Mott insulating phase and high-temperature metallic phase.
Following the transient phase, we find that the restoration of the Mott and CDW
order begins around the same time. This highlights that the Mott transition is
tied to the CDW structural distortion, although earlier studies have shown that
the collapse of Mott and CDW phases are decoupled from each other.
Interestingly, as the suppressed order starts to recover, a long-lived
metastable phase emerges before the material recovers to the ground state. Our
results demonstrate that it is the CDW lattice order that drives the material
into this metastable phase, which is indeed a commensurate CDW-Mott insulating
phase but with a smaller CDW amplitude. Moreover, we find that the long-lived
state emerges only under strong photoexcitation and has no evidence when the
photoexcitation strength is weak.

syllable and its acoustic correlate, i.e., the speech envelope, have a
preferred range of rhythmicity between 4 and 8 Hz, it is hypothesized that
theta-band neural oscillations play a major role in extracting syllables based
on the envelope. A literature survey, however, reveals inconsistent evidence
about the relationship between speech envelope and syllables, and the current
study revisits this question by analyzing large speech corpora. It is shown
that the center frequency of speech envelope, characterized by the modulation
spectrum, reliably correlates with the rate of syllables only when the analysis
is pooled over minutes of speech recordings. In contrast, in the time domain, a
component of the speech envelope is reliably phase-locked to syllable onsets.
Based on a speaker-independent model, the timing of syllable onsets explains
about 24% variance of the speech envelope. These results indicate that local
features in the speech envelope, instead of the modulation spectrum, are a more
reliable acoustic correlate of syllables.

detailed understanding of the animal's sensory environment. For small model
organisms like C. elegans and larval D. melanogaster, controlling and measuring
the odor environment experienced by the animal can be challenging, especially
for airborne odors, which are subject to subtle effects from airflow,
temperature variation, and from the odor's adhesion, adsorption or reemission.
Here we present a method to flexibly control and precisely measure airborne
odor concentration in an arena with agar while imaging animal behavior.
Crucially and unlike previous methods, our method allows continuous monitoring
of the odor profile during behavior. We construct stationary chemical
landscapes in an odor flow chamber through spatially patterned odorized air.
The odor concentration is measured with a spatially distributed array of
digital gas sensors. Careful placement of the sensors allows the odor

important scientific goal for space-based GW detectors. Due to the effects of
gravity on three spacecrafts, it is hard to maintain the equality of the arm
length, so the time-delay interferometry (TDI) method is needed to cancel out
the laser frequency noise for space-based GW detectors. By considering the
first-generation TDI combination, we employ the Fisher information matrix to
study the accuracy of sky localizations for future space-based GW detectors and
their combined network. The main difference between future space-based GW
detectors includes the time-changing orientation of the detector plane, the arm
length, the orbital period of spacecrafts and the noise curve. We study the
effects of these factors on the accuracy of source localization at different
frequencies. We find that the amplitude modulation caused by the rotation of
the detector plane can help LISA and Taiji not only to improve the accuracy of
source localization but also to enlarge the sky coverage at frequencies below 1
mHz. As the frequency of monochromatic GWs increases, the Doppler modulation
becomes dominate and the equatorial pattern appears in the sky map. The effect
of arm length on the angular resolution mainly comes from the noise curve and
it is almost the same for both heliocentric and geocentric constellations. The
orbital period of the spacecrafts has little effect on the angular resolutions.
The improvement on the angular resolutions by the network of combined detectors
is small compared with a single detector and the angular resolutions are almost
the same with and without the TDI combination.

increase with time. The values of distance, combined with the measured orbiting
time, imply that the spot is rotating with a super-Keplerian velocity. These
results are hard to understand if the spot stay within the accretion flow thus
provide strong constraints on theoretical models for flares. Previously we have
proposed a ""ME"" model for the flares by analogy with the coronal mass ejection

surface of the accretion flow results in the formation of flux ropes, which are
then ejected out. Energetic electrons accelerated in the current sheet flow
into the flux rope region and their radiation is responsible for the flares. In
this paper, we apply the model to the interpretation of the GRAVITY results by
calculating the dynamics of the ejected flux rope, the evolution of the
magnetic field and the energy distribution of accelerated electrons, and the
radiation of the system. We find that the model can well explain the observed

prevent vertex collisions or edge overlap, the mesh movement in this work is
conducted in steps with relatively small movements. For moving boundary
problems, the exact position of the boundary is essential for having an
accurate solution. However, PINNs are frequently unable to satisfy Dirichlet
boundary conditions exactly. To overcome this issue, we have used hard boundary
condition enforcement to automatically satisfy Dirichlet boundary conditions.
Specifically, we first trained a PINN with soft boundary conditions to obtain a
particular solution. Then, this solution was tuned with exact boundary
positions and a proper distance function by using a new PINN considering only
the equation residual. To assess the accuracy of our approach, we used the
classical translation and rotation tests and compared them with a proper mesh
quality metric considering the change in the element area and shape. The

collapse (AIC) of accreting white dwarfs (WDs) for the production of
millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are investigated. I examine the binding energy model
due to the dynamical process in close binary systems and investigating the
possible mass of the companion sufficient to induce their orbital parameters.
The deterministic nature of this interaction has a strong sensitivity to the
equation of state of the binary systems (where the compactness of a neutron
star is proportional to the amount of binding energy) associated with their
initial conditions. This behavior will mimic the commonly assumed mass and
amount of accreted matter under the instantaneous mass loss ($\Delta M \sim
0.18M_{\odot}$). As a result, this will indicate an increase in the MSP's
gravitational mass due to angular momentum losses. The outcome of such a system
will then be a circular binary MSP in which the companion is a low-mass WD,
thus distinguishing the binary formation scenarios. In addition, the results of
this work could provide constraints on the expected mass and binding energy of
a neutron star based on the accretion rate

Laplacian in an unbounded 3D periodic lattice made of thin bars (of width

with the union of segments which all go to $+\infty$ as $\varepsilon$ tends to
zero due to the Dirichlet boundary condition. We show that the first spectral

while the length of the next spectral segments is $O(\varepsilon)$. To
establish these results, we need to study in detail the properties of the
Dirichlet Laplacian $A^{\Omega}$ in the geometry $\Omega$ obtained by zooming
at the junction regions of the initial periodic lattice. This problem has its
own interest and playing with symmetries together with max-min arguments as
well as a well-chosen Friedrichs inequality, we prove that $A^{\Omega}$ has a
unique eigenvalue in its discrete spectrum, which generates the first spectral

specifically deep learning models have emerged as an efficient way to discover
synergistic combinations. While previous methods reported fair performance,
their models usually do not take advantage of multi-modal data and they are
unable to handle new drugs or cell lines. In this study, we collected data from
various datasets covering various drug-related aspects. Then, we take advantage
of large-scale pre-training models to generate informative representations and
features for drugs, proteins, and diseases. Based on that, a message-passing
graph is built on top to propagate information together with graph structure
learning flexibility. This is first introduced in the biological networks and
enables us to generate pseudo-relations in the graph. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in comparison with other deep learning-based methods
on synergistic prediction benchmark datasets. We are also capable of
inferencing new drug combination data in a test on an independent set released
by AstraZeneca, where 10% of improvement over previous methods is observed. In
addition, we're robust against unseen drugs and surpass almost 15% AU ROC

the future wet-lab discovery of novel drugs and the building of promising

traditionally used metrics based on the edit distance between HTR and ground
truth (GT) transcripts, at both the character and word levels. This is very
adequate when the experimental protocol assumes that both GT and HTR text lines
are the same, which allows edit distances to be independently computed to each
given line. Driven by recent advances in pattern recognition, HTR systems
increasingly face the end-to-end page-level transcription of a document, where
the precision of locating the different text lines and their corresponding
reading order (RO) play a key role. In such a case, the standard metrics do not
take into account the inconsistencies that might appear. In this paper, the
problem of evaluating HTR systems at the page level is introduced in detail. We
analyse the convenience of using a two-fold evaluation, where the transcription
accuracy and the RO goodness are considered separately. Different alternatives
are proposed, analysed and empirically compared both through partially
simulated and through real, full end-to-end experiments. Results support the
validity of the proposed two-fold evaluation approach. An important conclusion
is that such an evaluation can be adequately achieved by just two simple and
well-known metrics: the Word Error Rate (WER), that takes transcription
sequentiality into account, and the here re-formulated Bag of Words Word Error
Rate (bWER), that ignores order. While the latter directly and very accurately
assess intrinsic word recognition errors, the difference between both metrics
gracefully correlates with the Normalised Spearman's Foot Rule Distance (NSFD),
a metric which explicitly measures RO errors associated with layout analysis
flaws.

interpolate in a strong sense, i.e., omega by omega, between zeros at fixed
pre-specified times. Their additive randomization allows one to match any
finite sequence of target random variables, indexed by the given fixed dates,
on the whole probability space. The randomized arcade processes can thus be
interpreted as a generalization of anticipative stochastic bridges. The
filtrations generated by these processes are utilized to construct a class of
martingales which interpolate between the given target random variables. These
so-called filtered arcade martingales (FAMs) are almost-sure solutions to the
martingale interpolation problem and reveal an underlying stochastic filtering
structure. In the special case of nearly-Markov randomized arcade processes,
the dynamics of FAMs are informed through Bayesian updating. FAMs can be
connected to martingale optimal transport (MOT) by considering
optimally-coupled target random variables. Moreover, FAMs allow to formulate
the information-based martingale optimal transport problem, which enables the
introduction of noise in MOT, in a similar fashion to how Schr\""odinger's
problem introduces noise in optimal transport. This information-based transport
problem is concerned with selecting an optimal martingale coupling for the
target random variables under the influence of the noise that is generated by
an arcade process.

large-scale Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problems. However, the
success of MFC relies on the presumption that given the local states and
actions of all the agents, the next (local) states of the agents evolve
conditionally independent of each other. Here we demonstrate that even in a
MARL setting where agents share a common global state in addition to their
local states evolving conditionally independently (thus introducing a
correlation between the state transition processes of individual agents), the
MFC can still be applied as a good approximation tool. The global state is
assumed to be non-decomposable i.e., it cannot be expressed as a collection of
local states of the agents. We compute the approximation error as
$\mathcal{O}(e)$ where $e=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\left[\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}|}
+\sqrt{|\mathcal{U}|}\right]$. The size of the agent population is denoted by
the term $N$, and $|\mathcal{X}|, |\mathcal{U}|$ respectively indicate the
sizes of (local) state and action spaces of individual agents. The
approximation error is found to be independent of the size of the shared global
state space. We further demonstrate that in a special case if the reward and
state transition functions are independent of the action distribution of the
population, then the error can be improved to
$e=\frac{\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}|}}{\sqrt{N}}$. Finally, we devise a Natural Policy
Gradient based algorithm that solves the MFC problem with
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ sample complexity and obtains a policy that is
within $\mathcal{O}(\max\{e,\epsilon\})$ error of the optimal MARL policy for
any $\epsilon>0$.

an approach to evaluating consensus algorithms and blockchain platforms in a
hostile network environment with the presence of byzantine and other network

behaviors of consensus algorithms under different typical and faulty
operational scenarios. Next, we implemented a blockchain application using
different consensus protocols and tested their performance using chaos
engineering techniques. To demonstrate our generic evaluation approach, we
analyze the performance of four permissioned blockchain platforms and their
consensus protocols. Our results showed that stochastic modeling is an
inexpensive and efficient technique for analyzing consensus protocols. But they
do not represent the actual performance of the consensus protocols in a
production environment. Moreover, an experiment with chaos engineering
indicates that if two different blockchain platforms use the same blockchain
algorithm or protocol, we should not assume they will have similar performance.
Therefore, It is also essential to consider the role of platform architecture
and how the protocols are engineered in a given platform.

"2301.08740","Tie Wei","Paul C. Fife","Scaling approaches to steady wall-induced turbulence","41 pages, 4 figures. The article is submitted posthumously by Dr. Tie
  Wei, with the permission of Dr. Paul Fife's children: John Fife, Kit Barker,
  and Richard Fife",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of discerning key features of steady turbulent flow adjacent to a
wall has drawn the attention of some of the most noted fluid dynamicists of all
time. Standard examples of such features are found in the mean velocity
profiles of turbulent flow in channels, pipes or boundary layers. The aim of
this review article is to expound the essence of some elementary theoretical
efforts in this regard. Possibly the best known of them, and certainly the
simplest, is the argument (obtained independently) by Izakson (1937) and
Millikan (1939). They showed that if an inner scaling and an outer scaling for
the profile are valid near the wall and near the center of the flow (or the
edge of the boundary layer), respectively, and if there is an overlap region
where both scalings are valid, then the profile must be logarithmic in that
common region. That theoretical justification has been used and expanded upon
by innumerable authors for over 60 years, and at the present time is still
rightly enjoying popularity.
  Although background discussions of several related topics are included in the
present article, for example the classical ideas of Prandtl and von Karman, the
main foci will be on (i) a careful examination of the Izakson-Millikan
argument, together with a presentation of a better mathematical justification
for its conclusion; and (ii) a detailed clarification of a newer approach to
gaining theoretical understanding of the mean velocity and Reynolds stress
profiles based on the search for scaling patches.
  The two approaches share common goals, they are both heavily involved with
scaling concepts, and many results are similar, but the logical trains of
thought are entirely different. The first, as mentioned, dates back to the 30's
and the second was introduced in a series of recent papers by Fife, Wei and
Klewicki et al.

  Factor-Constrained Integration in Volatile Peak Shaving Conditions",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Large-scale power-to-hydrogen (P2H) systems formed by multi-stack are
potentially powerful peak-shaving resources of power systems. However, due to
the research gap in connecting the grid-side performance with the inherent
operation control, the continuous operation of P2H loads is limited by the PF
assessment under volatile conditions when integrating into the grid. This paper
first fills the gap in proposing the analytical models of active and reactive
power of P2H loads with a typical power converter interface topology. On this
basis, the all-condition PF characteristics of multi-stack P2H loads are
captured as functions of unified current and temperature control variables.
Then, a PF-constrained multi-timescale control framework is constructed to
evaluate flexibility, PF, production, and security comprehensively. A two-level
nexus, including a model-based hour-ahead robust model predictive controller
and a rule-based real-time increment correction algorithm, is proposed to
guarantee the control accuracy and tractability. Case studies verify an
intrinsic control tradeoff between PF and production, resulting in an
unequal-split allocation strategy compared to the traditional
production-oriented control. The significance of the extended PF and security
dimensions is verified to improve the flexibility. Furthermore, five typical
operating modes respectively corresponding to low, medium, and high load levels
at the cluster level are concluded for industrial application.

However, existing methods are limited to offer timely diagnostics of these
particles with sufficient accuracy and information. Here, we introduce a novel
method for real-time, in situ analysis using machine learning assisted digital
inline holography (DIH). Our machine learning model uses a customized YOLO v5
architecture specialized for the detection and classification of small
biological particles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the
analysis of 10 plankton species with equivalent high accuracy and significantly
reduced processing time compared to previous methods. We also applied our
method to differentiate yeast cells under four metabolic states and from two
strains. Our results show that the proposed method can accurately detect and
differentiate cellular and subcellular features related to metabolic states and
strains. This study demonstrates the potential of machine learning driven DIH
approach as a sensitive and versatile diagnostic tool for real-time, in situ
analysis of both biotic and abiotic particles. This method can be readily
deployed in a distributive manner for scientific research and manufacturing on
an industrial scale.

  in Financial Markets",,,,,"q-fin.TR cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The financial markets, which involve more than $90 trillion market capitals,
attract the attention of innumerable investors around the world. Recently,
reinforcement learning in financial markets (FinRL) has emerged as a promising
direction to train agents for making profitable investment decisions. However,
the evaluation of most FinRL methods only focuses on profit-related measures
and ignores many critical axes, which are far from satisfactory for financial
practitioners to deploy these methods into real-world financial markets.
Therefore, we introduce PRUDEX-Compass, which has 6 axes, i.e., Profitability,
Risk-control, Universality, Diversity, rEliability, and eXplainability, with a
total of 17 measures for a systematic evaluation. Specifically, i) we propose
AlphaMix+ as a strong FinRL baseline, which leverages mixture-of-experts (MoE)
and risk-sensitive approaches to make diversified risk-aware investment
decisions, ii) we evaluate 8 FinRL methods in 4 long-term real-world datasets
of influential financial markets to demonstrate the usage of our
PRUDEX-Compass, iii) PRUDEX-Compass together with 4 real-world datasets,
standard implementation of 8 FinRL methods and a portfolio management
environment is released as public resources to facilitate the design and
comparison of new FinRL methods. We hope that PRUDEX-Compass can not only shed
light on future FinRL research to prevent untrustworthy results from stagnating
FinRL into successful industry deployment but also provide a new challenging
algorithm evaluation scenario for the reinforcement learning (RL) community.

With the energy consumption of PoS systems being an under-researched area, we
replicate, expand and update embryonary work modelling it and comparing
different PoS-based DLTs with each other and with other non-PoS systems. In
doing so, we suggest and implement a number of improvements to an existing PoS
energy consumption model. We find that there may be significant differences in
the energy consumption of PoS systems analysed and confirm that, regardless of
these differences, their energy consumption is several orders of magnitude
below that of Bitcoin Core.

  Wireless Sensor and IoT Networks","In International Conference on Ubiquitous Networking (UNet 2022),
  Springer",,,,"cs.NI cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This article explores the concepts of online protocol synthesis using
Reinforcement Learning (RL). The study is performed in the context of sensor
and IoT networks with ultra low complexity wireless transceivers. The paper
introduces the use of RL and Multi Armed Bandit (MAB), a specific type of RL,
for Medium Access Control (MAC) under different network and traffic conditions.
It then introduces a novel learning based protocol synthesis framework that
addresses specific difficulties and limitations in medium access for both
random access and time slotted networks. The mechanism does not rely on carrier
sensing, network time-synchronization, collision detection, and other low level
complex operations, thus making it ideal for ultra simple transceiver hardware
used in resource constrained sensor and IoT networks. Additionally, the ability
of independent protocol learning by the nodes makes the system robust and
adaptive to the changes in network and traffic conditions. It is shown that the
nodes can be trained to learn to avoid collisions, and to achieve network
throughputs that are comparable to ALOHA based access protocols in sensor and
IoT networks with simplest transceiver hardware. It is also shown that using
RL, it is feasible to synthesize access protocols that can sustain network
throughput at high traffic loads, which is not feasible in the ALOHA-based
systems. The ability of the system to provide throughput fairness under network
and traffic heterogeneities are also experimentally demonstrated.

  370-375). IEEE",,,"cs.NI cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper proposes a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) MAC slot
allocation protocol with efficient bandwidth usage in wireless sensor networks
and Internet of Things (IoTs). The developed protocol has two primary
components: a Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)-based slot allocation mechanism for
collision free transmission, and a Decentralized Defragmented Slot Backshift
(DDSB) operation for improving bandwidth usage efficiency. The proposed
framework is decentralized in that each node finds its transmission schedule
independently without the control of any centralized arbitrator. The developed
mechanism is suitable for networks with or without time synchronization, thus,
making it suitable for low-complexity wireless transceivers for wireless sensor
and IoT nodes. This framework is able to manage the trade-off between learning
convergence time and bandwidth. In addition, it allows the nodes to adapt to
topological changes while maintaining efficient bandwidth usage. The developed
logic is tested for both fully-connected and arbitrary mesh networks with
extensive simulation experiments. It is shown how the nodes can learn to select
collision-free transmission slots using MAB. Moreover, the nodes learn to
self-adjust their transmission schedules using a novel DDSB framework in order
to reduce bandwidth usage.

political science. However, the scope of these analyses is usually restricted
to roll call data where individual votes are directly observed. Here, we
examine a Bayesian mixture model with Dirichlet-multinomial components to infer
voting blocs within longitudinal referendum data aggregated at the municipal
level. As a case study, we analyze vote totals from 423 municipalities in the
US state Maine for 54 referendum questions balloted from 2008-2019. Using this
model, we recover the posterior distribution on the number of voting blocs, the
support for each question within each bloc, and the blocs' mixture within each
municipality. We find that these voting blocs are structured by geography and
are largely consistent across the study period. Further analysis of the
posterior distribution provides three additional findings: voting blocs exhibit
both gradients and discontinuities in their overall structure that are
consistent with geography and culture; a small number of questions are
inconsistent with the statewide bloc structure and these questions' content
relate to specific regions; and that the blocs exhibit evidence of increased
polarization across blocs during the study period. We conclude with an outline
of statistical extensions of this model, connections to other statistical
frameworks in political science (such as polling), and detail candidate
locations for subsequent applications of the model.

one can find disordered Hamiltonians hosting a tower of scars by adapting a

spin-1/2 model which is both partially localized and contains scars. We
demonstrate that the model is partially localized by studying numerically the
level spacing statistics and bipartite entanglement entropy. As disorder is
introduced, the adjacent gap ratio transitions from the Gaussian orthogonal
ensemble to the Poisson distribution and the entropy shifts from volume-law to
area-law scaling. We investigate the properties of scars in a partially
localized background and compare with a thermal background. At strong disorder,
states initialized inside or outside the scar subspace display different
dynamical behavior but have similar entanglement entropy and Schmidt gap. We
demonstrate that localization stabilizes scar revivals of initial states with
support both inside and outside the scar subspace. Finally, we show how strong
disorder introduces additional approximate towers of eigenstates.

The results show similar, but distinguishable spectra for both bulk suevite and

Aumuehle and Otting have spectra dominated by a Reststrahlen band at 9.3-9.6

between 8.5 and 9 micron, and 12.5 - 12.8 micron associated with crystalline

over its history. So spectral characteristics observed for impactites formed
only in a single impact like in the Ries impact event can be expected to be
very common on planetary bodies exposed to many more impacts in their past. We
conclude that in mid-infrared remote sensing data the surface of Mercury can be

possibly related to the presence of a misaligned inner disk. While broadly
aligned with the scattered-light shadows, the localized non-Keplerian feature
cannot be solely due to changes in temperature. Instead, we interpret the

theory is usually formulated in the worldsheet formalism, which describes a
single string (first-quantization). While this approach is intuitive and could
be pushed far due to the exceptional properties of two-dimensional theories, it
becomes cumbersome for some questions or even fails at a more fundamental
level. These motivations have led to the development of SFT, a description of
string theory using the field theory formalism (second-quantization). As a
field theory, SFT provides a rigorous and constructive formulation of string
theory.
  The main objective is to construct the closed bosonic SFT and to explain how
to assess the consistency of string theory with it. The accent is put on
providing the reader with the foundations, conceptual understanding and
intuition of what SFT is. After reading this book, they should be able to study
the applications from the literature.
  The book is organized in two parts. The first part reviews the topics of the
worldsheet theory that are necessary to build SFT (worldsheet path integral,
CFT and BRST quantization). The second part starts by introducing general
concepts of SFT from the BRST quantization. Then, it introduces off-shell
string amplitudes before providing a Feynman diagrams interpretation from which
the building blocks of SFT are extracted. After constructing the closed SFT, it
is used to outline the proofs of several important consistency properties, such
as background independence, unitarity and crossing symmetry. Finally, the
generalization to the superstring is also discussed.

Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\""at LMU (winter semesters 2017-2018 and

atmospheres should experience strongly spatially heterogeneous instellation.
The large irradiation contrast and resulting atmospheric circulation induce
temperature and chemical gradients that can produce asymmetries across the
eastern and western limbs of these atmospheres during transit. By observing an
(ultra)hot Jupiter's transmission spectrum at high spectral resolution, these
asymmetries can be recovered -- namely through net Doppler shifts originating
from the exoplanet's atmosphere yielded by cross-correlation analysis. Given
the range of mechanisms at play, identifying the underlying cause of observed
asymmetry is nontrivial. In this work, we explore sources and diagnostics of
asymmetries in high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy of hot and
ultra-hot Jupiters using both parameterized and self-consistent atmospheric
models. If an asymmetry is observed, we find that it can be difficult to
attribute it to equilibrium chemistry gradients because many other processes
can produce asymmetries. Identifying a molecule that is chemically stable over
the temperature range of a planetary atmosphere can help establish a
``baseline'' to disentangle the various potential causes of limb asymmetries
observed in other species. We identify CO as an ideal molecule, given its
stability over nearly the entirety of the ultra-hot Jupiter temperature range.
Furthermore, we find that if limb asymmetry is due to morning terminator
clouds, blueshifts for a number of species should decrease during transit.
Finally, by comparing our forward models to Kesseli et al. (2022), we
demonstrate that binning high-resolution spectra into two phase bins provides a
desirable trade-off between maintaining signal to noise and resolving
asymmetries.

The goal of this research is to determine for which classes $\mathcal{H}$ the

i.e., solvable in time $f(|H|)\cdot |G|^{O(1)}$.
  Curticapean, Dell, and Husfeldt (ESA 2021) conjectured that
$\oplus\mathsf{Sub}(\mathcal{H})$ is FPT if and only if the class of allowed
patterns $\mathcal{H}$ is ""matching splittable"", which means that for some
fixed $B$, every $H \in \mathcal{H}$ can be turned into a matching (a graph in
which every vertex has degree at most $1$) by removing at most $B$ vertices.
  Assuming the randomised Exponential Time Hypothesis, we prove their
conjecture for (I) all hereditary pattern classes $\mathcal{H}$, and (II) all
tree pattern classes, i.e., all classes $\mathcal{H}$ such that every $H\in

  We also establish almost tight fine-grained upper and lower bounds for the

critical in some sense. This particle system can be seen as an analytically

driving the invasion of a habitat by a cooperating population. Recent studies
from Birzu, Hallatschek and Korolev suggest the existence of three classes of
fluctuating fronts: pulled, semi pushed and fully pushed fronts. Here, we focus
on the fully pushed regime. We establish a Yaglom law for this branching
process and prove that the genealogy of the particles converges to a Brownian
Coalescent Point Process using a method of moments. In practice, the genealogy
of the BBM is seen as a random marked metric measure space and we use spinal
decomposition to prove its convergence in the Gromov-weak topology. We also
carry the spectral decomposition of a differential operator related to the BBM
to determine the invariant measure of the spine as well as its mixing time.

production in two different ways: (1) by changing the wind speed locally in
front of each turbine; and (2) by changing the overall flow resistance in the
farm and thus the so-called farm blockage effect. To better predict these
effects with low computational costs, we develop data-driven emulators of the
`local' or `internal' turbine thrust coefficient $C_T^*$ as a function of
turbine layout. We train the model using a multi-fidelity Gaussian Process (GP)
regression with a combination of low (engineering wake model) and high-fidelity
(Large-Eddy Simulations) simulations of farms with different layouts and wind
directions. A large set of low-fidelity data speeds up the learning process and
the high-fidelity data ensures a high accuracy. The trained multi-fidelity GP
model is shown to give more accurate predictions of $C_T^*$ compared to a
standard (single-fidelity) GP regression applied only to a limited set of
high-fidelity data. We also use the multi-fidelity GP model of $C_T^*$ with the
two-scale momentum theory (Nishino \& Dunstan 2020, J. Fluid Mech. 894, A2) to
demonstrate that the model can be used to give fast and accurate predictions of
large wind farm performance under various mesoscale atmospheric conditions.
This new approach could be beneficial for improving annual energy production

  While the automated summarisation of decompiled code can help Reverse

summarising source code, and no suitable dataset exists for this task.
  In this work, we extend large pre-trained language models of source code to
summarise decompiled binary functions. Furthermore, we investigate the impact
of input and data properties on the performance of such models. Our approach
consists of two main components; the data and the model.
  We first build CAPYBARA, a dataset of 214K decompiled function-documentation
pairs across various compiler optimisations. We extend CAPYBARA further by
generating synthetic datasets and deduplicating the data.
  Next, we fine-tune the CodeT5 base model with CAPYBARA to create BinT5. BinT5
achieves the state-of-the-art BLEU-4 score of 60.83, 58.82, and 44.21 for
summarising source, decompiled, and synthetically stripped decompiled code,

  Finally, we found that the performance of BinT5 is not heavily dependent on
the dataset size and compiler optimisation level. We recommend future research

approach obtains solutions at a given time step by either fully solving the HDM
or by combining partial HDM and ROM solves. A dynamic sampling procedure
identifies regions that require the HDM solution for global accuracy and the
reminder of the flow is reconstructed using the ROM. Moreover, solutions
combining both HDM and ROM solves use spatial filtering to eliminate potential
spurious oscillations that may develop. We test the proposed method on inviscid
compressible flow problems and demonstrate speedups up to an order of
magnitude.

gaining popularity. In data-driven modeling, machine learning methods such as
linear regression, neural networks or decision-tree based methods are being
applied. While these methods do not require domain knowledge, they are
sensitive to data quality. Therefore, improving data quality in a dataset is
beneficial for creating machine learning-based models. The improvement of data
quality can be implemented through preprocessing methods. A selected type of
preprocessing is feature engineering, which focuses on evaluating and improving
the quality of certain features inside the dataset. Feature engineering methods
include methods such as feature creation, feature expansion, or feature
selection. In this work, a Python framework containing different feature
engineering methods is presented. This framework contains different methods for
feature creation, expansion and selection; in addition, methods for
transforming or filtering data are implemented. The implementation of the
framework is based on the Python library scikit-learn. The framework is
demonstrated on a case study of a use case from energy demand prediction. A
data-driven model is created including selected feature engineering methods.
The results show an improvement in prediction accuracy through the engineered

foundation as the most general theory of the dynamics of a 4D brane embedded in

with a physical meaning, such as the cosmological constant which is there
related to the brane tension. Most studies of this model have been performed
assuming a maximally symmetric geometry for the 5D bulk, in which it has been
shown that the theory reduces to various types of Galileon. In contrast, the
general case for the geometry of the bulk provides a different covariantization
of the Galileon model than the covariant Galileon: the DBI-Galileon. From the
tight constraints on the gravitational waves speed, we are naturally led to
consider the non-relativistic limit of the model where the kinetic energy of
the brane is small compared to its tension, that we study in the context of
late-time cosmology. The DBI-Galileon in the non-relativistic limit is simply
an expansion around General Relativity (GR) which can be expressed as a
shift-symmetric Horndeski theory. We developed the description of this theory

tensor perturbations around a flat FLRW background, we found that they contain
a ghost degree of freedom leading to fatal instability of the vacuum for every
combination of the free parameters. As a lesson, we emphasized which of the
Horndeski terms competes to avoid this instability in more general cases.

sparsity in appropriate domains in order to solve the resulting ill-posed
problem, this paper explores the role of binary priors in super-resolution,
where the spike (or source) amplitudes are assumed to be binary-valued. Our
study is inspired by the problem of neural spike deconvolution, but also
applies to other applications such as symbol detection in hybrid millimeter
wave communication systems. This paper makes several theoretical and
algorithmic contributions to enable binary super-resolution with very few
measurements. Our results show that binary constraints offer much stronger
identifiability guarantees than sparsity, allowing us to operate in ""extreme
compression"" regimes, where the number of measurements can be significantly
smaller than the sparsity level of the spikes. To ensure exact recovery in this
""extreme compression"" regime, it becomes necessary to design algorithms that
exactly enforce binary constraints without relaxation. In order to overcome the
ensuing computational challenges, we consider a first order auto-regressive
filter (which appears in neural spike deconvolution), and exploit its special
structure. This results in a novel formulation of the super-resolution binary
spike recovery in terms of binary search in one dimension. We perform numerical
experiments that validate our theory and also show the benefits of binary

is not straightforward as it requires appropriate boundary conditions in
combination with a large domain size and long simulation duration. In this
paper, we extended the non-hydrostatic wave-flow model SWASH with additional
terms that account for the influence of a depth-uniform ambient current on the
wave dynamics, in which the current field can be taken from an external source
(e.g., from observations or a circulation model). We verified the model ability
by comparing predictions to results from linear theory, laboratory experiments
and a spectral wave model that accounts for wave interference effects. With
this extension, the model was able to account for current-induced changes to
the wave field (i.e., changes to the wave amplitude, length and direction) due
to following and opposing currents, and two classical examples of sheared
currents (a jet-like current and vortex ring). Furthermore, the model captured
the wave dynamics in the presence of strong opposing currents. This includes
reflections of relatively small amplitude waves at the theoretical blocking
point, and transmission of breaking waves beyond the theoretical blocking point
for larger wave amplitudes. The proposed model extension allows phase-resolving
models to more accurately and efficiently simulate the wave dynamics in coastal

characteristic length scale of the spatial domains occupied by organisms of a
single species. Our results reveal that aggregation is beneficial if triggered
when the local density of opponents does not exceed $30\%$; otherwise, the
behavioural strategy may harm individuals by increasing the average death risk.
We show that if organisms can perceive further distances, they can accurately
scan and interpret the signals from the neighbourhood, maximising the effects
of the locally adaptive aggregation on the death risk. Finally, we show that
the locally adaptive aggregation behaviour promotes biodiversity independently

conspecifics, even in the presence of a small number of enemies. We verify that

for node classification tasks; yet their predictive capability may be severely
compromised under adversarially designed unnoticeable perturbations to the

attacks aims at lowering the overall prediction accuracy, but we argue that the
resulting abnormal model performance may catch attention easily and invite
quick counterattack. Moreover, attacks through modification of existing graph
data may be hard to conduct if good security protocols are implemented. In this
work, we consider an easier attack harder to be noticed, through adversarially
patching the graph with new nodes and edges. The attack is universal: it
targets a single node each time and flips its connection to the same set of
patch nodes. The attack is unnoticeable: it does not modify the predictions of
nodes other than the target. We develop an algorithm, named GUAP, that achieves
high attack success rate but meanwhile preserves the prediction accuracy. GUAP
is fast to train by employing a sampling strategy. We demonstrate that a 5%
sampling in each epoch yields 20x speedup in training, with only a slight
degradation in attack performance. Additionally, we show that the adversarial

resonance imaging. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have been
widely investigated for artifact reduction tasks in MRI. As a retrospective
processing method, neural network does not cost additional acquisition time or
require new acquisition equipment, and seems to work better than traditional
artifact reduction methods. In the previous study, training such models require
the paired motion-corrupted and motion-free MR images. However, it is extremely
tough or even impossible to obtain these images in reality because patients
have difficulty in maintaining the same state during two image acquisition,
which makes the training in a supervised manner impractical. In this paper, we
proposed a new unsupervised abnormality extraction network (UNAEN) to alleviate
this problem. Our network realizes the transition from artifact domain to
motion-free domain by processing the abnormal information introduced by
artifact in unpaired MR images. Different from directly generating artifact
reduction results from motion-corrupted MR images, we adopted the strategy of
abnormality extraction to indirectly correct the impact of artifact in MR

  Spatio-temporal Trade-offs","14 Pages, 5 Figures",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sparse arrays have emerged as a popular alternative to the conventional
uniform linear array (ULA) due to the enhanced degrees of freedom (DOF) and
superior resolution offered by them. In the passive setting, these advantages
are realized by leveraging correlation between the received signals at
different sensors. This has led to the belief that sparse arrays require a
large number of temporal measurements to reliably estimate parameters of
interest from these correlations, and therefore they may not be preferred in
the sample-starved regime. In this paper, we debunk this myth by performing a
rigorous non-asymptotic analysis of the Coarray ESPRIT algorithm. This
seemingly counter-intuitive result is a consequence of the scaling of the
singular value of the coarray manifold, which compensates for the potentially
large covariance estimation error in the limited snapshot regime. Specifically,
we show that for a nested array operating in the regime of fewer sources than
sensors ($S=O(1)$), it is possible to bound the matching distance error between
the estimated and true directions of arrival (DOAs) by an arbitrarily small
quantity ($\epsilon$) with high probability, provided (i) the number of
temporal snapshots ($L$) scales only logarithmically with the number of sensors
($P$), i.e. $L=\Omega(\ln(P)/\epsilon^2)$, and (ii) a suitable separation
condition is satisfied. Our results also formally prove the well-known
empirical resolution benefits of sparse arrays, by establishing that the
minimum separation between sources can be $\Omega(1/P^2)$, as opposed to
separation $\Omega(1/P)$ required by a ULA with the same number of sensors. Our
sample complexity expression reveals the dependence on other key model
parameters such as SNR and the dynamic range of the source powers. This enables
us to establish the superior noise-resilience of nested arrays both
theoretically and empirically.

design. However, many DP algorithms have to fill in large DP tables,
represented by two-dimensional arrays, which causes at least quadratic running
times and space usages. This has led to the development of improved algorithms
for special cases when the DPs satisfy additional properties like, e.g., the
Monge property or total monotonicity.
  In this paper, we consider a new condition which assumes (among some other
technical assumptions) that the rows of the DP table are monotone. Under this
assumption, we introduce a novel data structure for computing
$(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate DP solutions in near-linear time and space in the
static setting, and with polylogarithmic update times when the DP entries
change dynamically. To the best of our knowledge, our new condition is
incomparable to previous conditions and is the first which allows to derive
dynamic algorithms based on existing DPs. Instead of using two-dimensional
arrays to store the DP tables, we store the rows of the DP tables using
monotone piecewise constant functions. This allows us to store length-$n$ DP
table rows with entries in $[0,W]$ using only polylog$(n,W)$ bits, and to
perform operations, such as $(\min,+)$-convolution or rounding, on these
functions in polylogarithmic time.
  We further present several applications of our data structure. For bicriteria
versions of $k$-balanced graph partitioning and simultaneous source location,
we obtain the first dynamic algorithms with subpolynomial update times, as well

other twist fields (composite twist fields), typically of higher dimension,

existing phase-field models that either violate static compatibility or
interfacial chemical equilibrium or are computationally costly. For
computational efficiency, the partial rank-one homogenization (PRH) scheme is
employed to enforce both static and kinematic compatibilities at the interface.
Moreover, interfacial chemical equilibrium is ensured by replacing the
composition field with the diffusion potential field as the independent
variable of the model. Its performance is demonstrated by simulating four
single-particle and one multi-particle cases for two binary two-phase alloys:
Ni-Al $\gamma^{\prime}/\gamma$ and UO$_2$/void. Its accuracy is then
investigated against analytical solutions. For the single-particle
$\gamma^{\prime}/\gamma$ alloy, we find that the accuracy of the phase-field
results remains unaffected for both planar and non-planar geometries when the
PRH scheme is employed. Fortuitously, in the UO$_2$/void simulations, despite a
strong elastic heterogeneity$\unicode{x2014}$the ratio of Young's modulus of
the void phase to that of the UO$_2$ phase is $10^{-4}\unicode{x2014}$we find
that the PRH scheme shows significantly better convergence compared to the
Voigt-Taylor scheme (VTS) for both planar and non-planar geometries.
Nevertheless, for the same interface width range as in the $\gamma^{'}/\gamma$
case, the interface migration in these simulations shows dependence on
interface width. Contrary to the $\gamma^{\prime}/\gamma$ simulations, we also
find that the simulated elastic fields show deviations from the analytical
solution in the non-planar UO$_2$/void case using the PRH scheme.

interest in the statistics community due to their diverse applications across
several domains. One of the most popular skew normal distributions, due to its
intuitive appeal, is the Azzalini's skew normal distribution. However, due to
the nature of the distribution it suffers from serious inferential problems.
Interestingly, the Bayesian approach has been shown to mitigate these issues.
Recently, another skew normal distribution, the Geometric skew normal
distribution, which is structurally different from Azzalini's skew normal
distribution, has been proposed as an alternative for modelling skewed data.
Despite the interest in skew normal distributions, a limited number of articles
deal with comparing the performance of different skew distributions, especially
in the Bayesian context. To address this gap, the article attempts to compare
these two skew normal distributions in the Bayesian paradigm for modelling data
with varied skewness. The posterior estimates of the parameters of the
geometric skew normal distribution are obtained using a hybrid Gibbs-Metropolis
algorithm and the posterior predictive fit to the data is also obtained.
Similarly, for the Azzalini's skew normal distribution, the posterior
predictive fit are derived using a Gibbs sampling algorithm. To compare the
performance, Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between the posterior predictive
distribution and original data is utilised to measure the goodness of fit for
both the models. An assortment of real and simulated data sets, with a wide
range of skewness, are analyzed using both the models and the advantages as
well as disadvantages of the two models are also discussed. Finally, a much
faster Variational Bayes method for approximating the posterior distribution of
the geometric skew normal model is proposed and its performance is discussed.

include carbon capture and sequestrations. These processes are often
semi-continuous and require regulation of the system's flow properties for
proper operation. Accurate computational models for the viscosity of carbon
dioxide hydrate systems at pre-nucleation conditions can be important for
process design and control of such technologies. (2) Methods: This work
validates the viscosity predictions of molecular dynamics simulations using
previously measured experimental data. The TIP4P/Ice force field was used to
model water, while the EPM2, TraPPE, and Zhang force fields were used for
carbon dioxide. The Green-Kubo and Einstein formulations of viscosity and
diffusivity were used in this work. (3) Results: All force fields overpredicted
viscosity when compared to experimental data, but EPM2 resulted in lower
discrepancies. Additionally, EPM2 was determined to model molecular behavior
expected from the macroscopic trends in viscosity with respect to temperature
and pressure. (4) Conclusions: The EPM2 force field more accurately predicted
the viscosity of carbon dioxide hydrates systems at pre-nucleation conditions
relative to TraPPE and Zhang.

$\sim$88% of the total UV flux incident on the inner circumstellar disks.
Lyman-alpha photons are generated at the accretion shocks and in the
protostellar chromospheres and must travel through accretion flows, winds and
jets, the protoplanetary disks, and the interstellar medium before reaching the
observer. This trajectory produces asymmetric, double-peaked features that
carry kinematic and opacity signatures of the disk environments. To understand
the link between the evolution of Lyman-alpha emission lines and the disks
themselves, we model HST-COS spectra from targets included in Data Release 3 of
the Hubble UV Legacy Library of Young Stars as Essential Standards (ULLYSES)
program. We find that resonant scattering in a simple spherical expanding shell
is able to reproduce the high velocity emission line wings, providing estimates
of the average velocities within the bulk intervening H I. The model velocities
are significantly correlated with the K band veiling, indicating a turnover
from Lyman-alpha profiles absorbed by outflowing winds to emission lines
suppressed by accretion flows as the hot inner disk is depleted. Just 30% of
targets in our sample have profiles with red-shifted absorption from accretion
flows, many of which have resolved dust gaps. At this stage, Lyman-alpha
photons may no longer intersect with disk winds along the path to the observer.
Our results point to a significant evolution of Lyman-alpha irradiation within
the gas disks over time, which may lead to chemical differences that are
observable with ALMA and JWST.

sequential recommendation models. It is said to help capture the transition
patterns among items. Most previous work on sequential recommendation that uses
side information models item IDs and side information separately, which may
fail to fully model the relation between the items and their side information.
Moreover, in real-world systems, not all values of item feature fields are
available. This hurts the performance of models that rely on side information.
Existing methods tend to neglect the context of missing item feature fields,
and fill them with generic or special values, e.g., unknown, which might lead
to sub-optimal performance. To address the limitation of sequential
recommenders with side information, we define a way to fuse side information
and alleviate the problem of missing side information by proposing a unified
task, namely the missing information imputation (MII), which randomly masks
some feature fields in a given sequence of items, including item IDs, and then
forces a predictive model to recover them. By considering the next item as a
missing feature field, sequential recommendation can be formulated as a special
case of MII. We propose a sequential recommendation model, called missing
information imputation recommender (MIIR), that builds on the idea of MII and
simultaneously imputes missing item feature values and predicts the next item.
We devise a dense fusion self-attention (DFSA) mechanism for MIIR to capture
all pairwise relations between items and their side information. Empirical
studies on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that MIIR, supervised by MII,
achieves a significantly better sequential recommendation performance than
state-of-the-art baselines.

the steady state in the localized phase is clustered around the inverse of the
extremal eigenvalue, in contrast to the ergodic phase which shows a broader

galaxies. We find a lower limit in the fractional contribution of ~5% with
respect to the general sample of infalling galaxies at similar group-centric
distance when using single line strength analysis, or ~15-30% when adopting
bivariate distributions. The stellar populations show a subtle but significant
difference towards older ages, and a higher fraction of quiescent galaxies. We

class of optimization problems such as group synchronization, point-set
registration, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Such problems are
instances of the little noncommutative Grothendieck problem (LNCG), a natural
generalization of quadratic combinatorial optimization where, instead of binary
decision variables, one optimizes over orthogonal matrices. In this work, we
establish an embedding of this class of LNCG problems over the orthogonal group
onto a quantum Hamiltonian. This embedding is accomplished by identifying
orthogonal matrices with their double cover (Pin and Spin group) elements,
which we represent as quantum states. We connect this construction to the
theory of free fermions, which provides a physical interpretation of the
derived LNCG Hamiltonian as a two-body interacting-fermion model due to the
quadratic nature of the problem. Determining extremal states of this
Hamiltonian provides an outer approximation to the original problem, analogous
to classical relaxations of the problem via semidefinite programming. When
optimizing over the special orthogonal group, our quantum relaxation naturally
obeys additional, powerful constraints based on the convex hull of rotation
matrices. The classical size of this convex-hull representation is exponential
in matrix dimension, whereas the quantum representation requires only a linear
number of qubits. Finally, to project the relaxed solution into the feasible
space, we employ rounding procedures which return orthogonal matrices from
appropriate measurements of the quantum state. Through numerical experiments we
provide evidence that this quantum relaxation can produce high-quality
approximations.

that has recently started its science program which will enable breakthroughs
in astrophysics and planetary science. Notably, JWST will provide the very
first observations of the earliest luminous objects in the Universe and start a
new era of exoplanet atmospheric characterization. This transformative science
is enabled by a 6.6 m telescope that is passively cooled with a 5-layer
sunshield. The primary mirror is comprised of 18 controllable, low areal
density hexagonal segments, that were aligned and phased relative to each other
in orbit using innovative image-based wavefront sensing and control algorithms.
This revolutionary telescope took more than two decades to develop with a
widely distributed team across engineering disciplines. We present an overview
of the telescope requirements, architecture, development, superb on-orbit
performance, and lessons learned. JWST successfully demonstrates a segmented
aperture space telescope and establishes a path to building even larger space
telescopes.

via the superradiant instability around primordial black holes, focusing on the
mass range $10^{14}-10^{18}$ kg where the latter may account for all the dark
matter. We take into account the leading effects of axion self-interactions,
showing that, even though these limit the number of axions produced within each
cloud, a large number of superradiant axions become free of the black hole's
gravitational potential and accumulate in the intergalactic medium or even in
the host galaxy, depending on their escape velocity. This means that primordial
black hole dark matter may lead to a sizeable astrophysical population of
non-relativistic axions, with masses ranging from 0.1 eV to 1 MeV, depending on
the primordial black hole mass and spin. We then show that if such axions
couple to photons their contribution to the galactic and extragalactic
background flux, mainly in the X-ray and gamma-ray band of the spectrum, is
already beyond current observational limits for a large range of parameters
that are, therefore, excluded. We finish by showing the prospects of the Athena
X-ray telescope to further probe this co-existence of primordial black holes
and axions.

information processing. We discuss a practical setting where this interconnect,
modeled by a quantum channel, is used once with the aim of sharing high
fidelity entanglement. For any channel, we provide methods to easily find both
this maximum fidelity and optimal inputs that achieve it. Unlike most metrics
for sharing entanglement, this maximum fidelity can be shown to be
multiplicative. This ensures a complete understanding in the sense that the
maximum fidelity and optimal inputs found in our one-shot setting extend even
when the channel is used multiple times, possibly with other channels. Optimal
inputs need not be fully entangled. We find the minimum entanglement in these
optimal inputs can even vary discontinuously with channel noise. Generally,
noise parameters are hard to identify and remain unknown for most channels.
However, for all qubit channels with qubit environments, we provide a rigorous
noise parametrization which we explain in-terms of no-cloning. This noise
parametrization and a channel representation we call the standard Kraus
decomposition have pleasing properties that make them both useful more
generally.

work, we study the evolution of carbon-oxygen WD -- red giant (RG) binaries
(including the role of magnetic confinement) as possible SN Ia progenitors (the
so-called symbiotic progenitor channel). Using the \textsc{mesa} stellar
evolution code, we calculate the time dependence of the structure of the RG
star, the wind mass loss, the Roche-lobe-overflow (RLOF) mass-transfer rate,
the polar mass-accretion rate (in the case of magnetic confinement), and the
orbital and angular-momentum evolution. We consider cases where the WD is
non-magnetic and cases where the magnetic field is strong enough to force
accretion onto the two small polar caps of the WD. Confined accretion onto a
small area allows for more efficient hydrogen burning, potentially suppressing
nova outbursts. This makes it easier for the WD to grow in mass towards the
Chandrasekhar mass limit and explode as a SN Ia. With magnetic confinement, the
initial parameter space of the symbiotic channel for SNe Ia is shifted towards
shorter orbital periods and lower donor masses compared to the case without
magnetic confinement. Searches for low-mass He WDs or relatively low-mass
giants with partially stripped envelopes that survived the supernova explosion
and are found in SN remnants will provide crucial insights for our
understanding of the contribution of this symbiotic channel.

  winds on star formation in the FIRE cosmological simulations","17 pages, 12 figures",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Negative feedback from accreting supermassive black holes is regarded as a
key ingredient in suppressing star formation and quenching massive galaxies.
However, several models and observations suggest that black hole feedback may
have a positive effect, triggering star formation by compressing interstellar
medium gas to higher densities. We investigate the dual role of black hole
feedback using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the Feedback In
Realistic Environments (FIRE) project, including a novel implementation of
hyper-refined accretion-disc winds. Focusing on a massive, star-forming galaxy
at $z \sim 2$ ($M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{12.5} \, {\rm M}_{\odot}$), we show that
strong quasar winds with kinetic power $\sim$10$^{46}$ erg/s acting for
$>$20$\,$Myr drive the formation of a central gas cavity and can dramatically
reduce the star formation rate surface density across the galaxy disc. The
suppression of star formation is primarily driven by reducing the amount of gas
that can become star-forming, compared to directly evacuating the pre-existing
star-forming gas reservoir (preventive feedback dominates over ejective
feedback). Despite the global negative impact of quasar winds, we identify
several plausible signatures of local positive feedback, including: (1) spatial
anti-correlation of wind-dominated regions and star-forming clumps, (2) higher
local star formation efficiency in compressed gas near the edge of the cavity,
and (3) increased local contribution of outflowing material to star formation.
Stars forming under the presence of quasar winds tend to do so at larger radial
distances. Our results suggest that positive and negative AGN feedback can
coexist in galaxies, but local positive triggering of star formation plays a
minor role in global galaxy growth.

stripped of their outer hydrogen envelope, is a catalyst of the cosmic matter
cycle and decisive ingredient of massive star evolution. Yet, its theoretical
fundament is only starting to emerge with major dependencies still to be
uncovered.
  AIMS: A temperature or radius dependence is usually not included in
descriptions for the mass loss of classical Wolf-Rayet (cWR) stars, despite
being crucial for other hot star wind domains. We thus aim to determine whether
such a dependency will also be necessary for a comprehensive description of
mass loss in the cWR regime.
  METHODS: Sequences of dynamically consistent atmosphere models were
calculated with the hydrodynamic branch of the PoWR code along the temperature
domain, using different choices for luminosity, mass, and surface abundances.
For the first time, we allowed nonmonotonic velocity fields when solving the
equation of motion. The resulting velocity structures were then interpolated
for the comoving-frame radiative transfer, ensuring that the main wind
characteristics were preserved.
  RESULTS: We find a strong dependence of the mass-loss rate with the
temperature of the critical/sonic point which mainly reflects the different
radii and resulting gravitational accelerations. Moreover, we obtain a relation
between the observed effective temperature and the transformed mass-loss rate
which seems to be largely independent of the underlying stellar parameters. The
relation shifts for different clumping factors in the outer wind. Below a
characteristic value of -4.5, the slope of this relation changes and the winds
become transparent for He II ionizing photons.
  CONCLUSIONS: The mass loss of cWR stars is a high-dimensional problem but
also shows inherent scalings which can be used to obtain an approximation of
the observed effective temperature. (...)

rise to a well-defined length scale that can be measured in experiments.

independent upper limit on the planetary mass would constrain the planetary

is not yet very stringent (it is also sensitively dependent on the disc scale
height). These results can be extended to account for the history of planetary

Nevertheless, existing recursive approaches typically require large amounts of

provides high accuracy while requiring low computational cost and minimal

recursive one using a probabilistic framework that is robust to non-informative

analyzing Sentinel-2 satellite data covering two areas in the United States.
The performance of three static classification algorithms and their recursive

the linear polarization degree of both prompt and afterglow emission in the
soft X-ray energy band. GRB 221009A is an exceptionally bright gamma-ray burst
(GRB) that reached Earth on 2022 October 9 after travelling through the dust of
the Milky Way. The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) pointed at GRB
221009A on October 11 to observe, for the first time, the 2-8 keV X-ray
polarization of a GRB afterglow. We set an upper limit to the polarization
degree of the afterglow emission of 13.8% at a 99% confidence level. This
result provides constraints on the jet opening angle and the viewing angle of
the GRB, or alternatively, other properties of the emission region.
Additionally, IXPE captured halo-rings of dust-scattered photons which are
echoes of the GRB prompt emission. The 99% confidence level upper limit to the
prompt polarization degree depends on the background model assumption and it
ranges between ~55% to ~82%. This single IXPE pointing provides both the first
assessment of X-ray polarization of a GRB afterglow and the first GRB study
with polarization observations of both the prompt and afterglow phases.

spectroscopic survey that aims to measure the expansion rate of the Universe at
$z \sim 2.4$ to 1% precision for both $H(z)$ and $D_A(z)$. HETDEX is in the
process of mapping in excess of one million Lyman Alpha emitting (LAE) galaxies
and a similar number of lower-z galaxies as a tracer of the large-scale
structure. The success of the measurement is predicated on the post-observation
separation of galaxies with Ly$\alpha$ emission from the lower-$z$ interloping
galaxies, primarily [OII], with low contamination and high recovery rates. The
Emission Line eXplorer (ELiXer) is the principal classification tool for
HETDEX, providing a tunable balance between contamination and completeness as
dictated by science needs. By combining multiple selection criteria, ELiXer
improves upon the 20 Angstrom rest-frame equivalent width cut commonly used to
distinguish LAEs from lower-$z$ [OII] emitting galaxies. Despite a spectral
resolving power, R $\sim800$, that cannot resolve the [OII] doublet, we
demonstrate the ability to distinguish LAEs from foreground galaxies with 98.1%
accuracy. We estimate a contamination rate of Ly$\alpha$ by [OII] of 1.2% and a
Ly$\alpha$ recovery rate of 99.1% using the default ELiXer configuration. These
rates meet the HETDEX science requirements.

Theoretically, this module does not rely on the pixel-wise size or position in

the manifolds are assumed to be linear subspaces, many methods succeed using
low-rank and sparse priors, which have been studied extensively over the past
two decades. Unfortunately, most real-world datasets can not be well
approximated by linear subspaces. On the other hand, several works have
proposed to identify the manifolds by learning a feature map such that the data

knowledge of the membership of samples to clusters, or are shown to learn
trivial representations. In this paper, we propose to simultaneously perform
clustering and learn a union-of-subspace representation via Maximal Coding Rate
Reduction. Experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets show that the

composition fluctuations representative of phase separation in irradiated
FeCrAl alloys, are investigated separately as well as superposed together in
simulations. We explore the effects of defects on the stress-strain behavior,
specifically yield strength and hardening response, of FeCrAl nanopillars. Our
simulations confirm the widely accepted fact that irradiated alloys exhibit a
stress-strain response with higher yield strength and hardening as compared to
homogeneous alloys. However, our DDD calculations reveal an atypical
superposition of the hardening contributions due to composition inhomogeneity
and irradiation loops wherein hardening due composition inhomogeneity
counteracts hardening due to irradiation loops at small scales. As a result, we
observe that the yield strength in irradiated alloys, after taking into
consideration the effects of both composition inhomogeneity and irradiation
loops, is smaller than the yield strength of the alloys with only irradiation
loops and is approximately same for the alloy with composition inhomogeneity
alone. We identify this destructive interference in the superposition in our
parallel TEM in situ tensile tests on unirradiated, ion irradiated, and neutron
irradiated C35M FeCrAl alloy as well. This destructive interference in the
hardening contributions contrasts with the widely utilized dispersed barrier

proto-Herbig Ae stars. The stars are in an unstable non-hierarchical
configuration, and one member, a borderline brown dwarf, is moving away from
the protostellar system with 25 km/s, after being ejected about 5,800 yr ago as
an orphaned protostar. Five of the embedded sources are surrounded by small,
possibly truncated, disks resolved at 1.3 mm with ALMA. Proper motions and

two contrast substructures: figure and ground. The figure consists of numerous
auto-generated substructures with an inherent hierarchy of far more smalls than
larges. Through these substructures, the structural beauty of an image (L) can
be computed by the multiplication of the number of substructures (S) and their
inherent hierarchy (H). This definition implies that the more substructures,
the more living or more structurally beautiful, and the higher hierarchy of the
substructures, the more living or more structurally beautiful. This is the
non-recursive approach to the structural beauty of images or the livingness of
space. In this paper we develop a recursive approach, which derives all
substructures of an image (instead of its figure) and continues the deriving
process for those decomposable substructures until none of them are
decomposable. All of the substructures derived at different iterations (or
recursive levels) together constitute a living structure; hence the notion of
living images. We applied the recursive approach to a set of images and found
that (1) the number of substructures of an image is far lower (3 percent on
average) than the number of pixels and the centroids of the substructures can
effectively capture the skeleton or saliency of the image; (2) all the images
have the recursive levels more than three, indicating that they are indeed
living images; (3) no more than 2 percent of the substructures are
decomposable; (4) structural beauty can be measured by the recursively defined
substructures, as well as their decomposable subsets. The recursive approach is
proved to be more robust than the non-recursive approach. The recursive
approach and the non-recursive approach both provide a powerful means to study
the livingness or vitality of space in cities and communities.

relationships. To mitigate these challenges in practice, researchers augment
causal learning with known causal relations. The goal of the paper is to study
the impact of expert knowledge on causal relations in the form of additional
constraints used in the formulation of the nonparametric NOTEARS. We provide a
comprehensive set of comparative analyses of biasing the model using different
types of knowledge. We found that (i) knowledge that corrects the mistakes of
the NOTEARS model can lead to statistically significant improvements, (ii)
constraints on active edges have a larger positive impact on causal discovery
than inactive edges, and surprisingly, (iii) the induced knowledge does not
correct on average more incorrect active and/or inactive edges than expected.
We also demonstrate the behavior of the model and the effectiveness of domain
knowledge on a real-world dataset.

(ML) as a powerful form of data analysis with widespread applicability beyond
its historical roots in the design of autonomous agents. However, relatively
little attention has been paid to the interaction between people and ML
systems. Recent developments on Explainable ML address this by providing visual
and textual information on how the ML system arrived at a conclusion. In this
paper we view the interaction between humans and ML systems within the broader
context of interaction between agents capable of learning and explanation.
Within this setting, we argue that it is more helpful to view the interaction
as characterised by two-way intelligibility of information rather than once-off
explanation of a prediction. We formulate two-way intelligibility as a property
of a communication protocol. Development of the protocol is motivated by a set
of `Intelligibility Axioms' for decision-support systems that use ML with a
human-in-the-loop. The axioms are intended as sufficient criteria to claim
that: (a) information provided by a human is intelligible to an ML system; and
(b) information provided by an ML system is intelligible to a human. The axioms
inform the design of a general synchronous interaction model between agents
capable of learning and explanation. We identify conditions of compatibility
between agents that result in bounded communication, and define Weak and Strong
Two-Way Intelligibility between agents as properties of the communication
protocol.

Adapters, prefix tuning, BitFit, and LoRA) have been proposed. However, their
designs are hand-crafted separately, and it remains unclear whether certain
design patterns exist for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Thus, we present a
parameter-efficient fine-tuning design paradigm and discover design patterns
that are applicable to different experimental settings. Instead of focusing on
designing another individual tuning strategy, we introduce parameter-efficient
fine-tuning design spaces that parameterize tuning structures and tuning
strategies. Specifically, any design space is characterized by four components:
layer grouping, trainable parameter allocation, tunable groups, and strategy
assignment. Starting from an initial design space, we progressively refine the
space based on the model quality of each design choice and make greedy
selection at each stage over these four components. We discover the following
design patterns: (i) group layers in a spindle pattern; (ii) allocate the
number of trainable parameters to layers uniformly; (iii) tune all the groups;
(iv) assign proper tuning strategies to different groups. These design patterns
result in new parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. We show experimentally
that these methods consistently and significantly outperform investigated

supported by the instanton statistics of shuttling protons, reveals that the

catastrophic forgetting of past tasks and provide an informative prior when
learning new tasks. We revisit sequential Bayesian inference and test whether
having access to the true posterior is guaranteed to prevent catastrophic
forgetting in Bayesian neural networks. To do this we perform sequential
Bayesian inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We propagate the posterior as
a prior for new tasks by fitting a density estimator on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
samples. We find that this approach fails to prevent catastrophic forgetting
demonstrating the difficulty in performing sequential Bayesian inference in
neural networks. From there we study simple analytical examples of sequential
Bayesian inference and CL and highlight the issue of model misspecification
which can lead to sub-optimal continual learning performance despite exact
inference. Furthermore, we discuss how task data imbalances can cause
forgetting. From these limitations, we argue that we need probabilistic models
of the continual learning generative process rather than relying on sequential
Bayesian inference over Bayesian neural network weights. In this vein, we also
propose a simple baseline called Prototypical Bayesian Continual Learning,
which is competitive with state-of-the-art Bayesian continual learning methods

several challenges, among which the lack of observability and the high density
of the distribution system. While data-driven alternatives based on Machine
Learning models could be a choice, they suffer in DSSE because of the lack of
labeled data. In fact, measurements in the distribution system are often noisy,
corrupted, and unavailable. To address these issues, we propose the Deep
Statistical Solver for Distribution System State Estimation (DSS$^2$), a deep
learning model based on graph neural networks (GNNs) that accounts for the
network structure of the distribution system and for the physical governing
power flow equations. DSS$^2$ leverages hypergraphs to represent the
heterogeneous components of the distribution systems and updates their latent
representations via a node-centric message-passing scheme. A weakly supervised
learning approach is put forth to train the DSS$^2$ in a learning-to-optimize
fashion w.r.t. the Weighted Least Squares loss with noisy measurements and
pseudomeasurements. By enforcing the GNN output into the power flow equations
and the latter into the loss function, we force the DSS$^2$ to respect the
physics of the distribution system. This strategy enables learning from noisy
measurements, acting as an implicit denoiser, and alleviating the need for
ideal labeled data. Extensive experiments with case studies on the IEEE 14-bus,
70-bus, and 179-bus networks showed the DSS$^2$ outperforms by a margin the
conventional Weighted Least Squares algorithm in accuracy, convergence, and
computational time, while being more robust to noisy, erroneous, and missing
measurements. The DSS$^2$ achieves a competing, yet lower, performance compared
with the supervised models that rely on the unrealistic assumption of having

optimization algorithms - including quantum annealing. While the selector
algorithm has applications in multiple areas, it is particularly useful in

for developing intelligent systems that are capable of working with humans more
effectively. An obvious choice in developing explainable intelligent systems
relies on employing knowledge representation formalisms which are inherently
tailored towards expressing human knowledge e.g., interrogative agendas. In the
scope of this work, we focus on formal concept analysis (FCA), a standard
knowledge representation formalism, to express interrogative agendas, and in
particular to categorize objects w.r.t. a given set of features. Several
FCA-based algorithms have already been in use for standard machine learning
tasks such as classification and outlier detection. These algorithms use a
single concept lattice for such a task, meaning that the set of features used
for the categorization is fixed. Different sets of features may have different
importance in that categorization, we call a set of features an agenda. In many
applications a correct or good agenda for categorization is not known
beforehand. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning algorithm to construct a
good interrogative agenda explaining the data. Such algorithm is meant to call
existing FCA-based classification and outlier detection algorithms iteratively,
to increase their accuracy and reduce their sample complexity. The proposed
method assigns a measure of importance to different set of features used in the
categorization, hence making the results more explainable.

  for Time Series","This is a preprint. The paper has been accepted by SIAM SDM2023",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Recent rapid development of sensor technology has allowed massive
fine-grained time series (TS) data to be collected and set the foundation for
the development of data-driven services and applications. During the process,
data sharing is often involved to allow the third-party modelers to perform
specific time series data mining (TSDM) tasks based on the need of data owner.
The high resolution of TS brings new challenges in protecting privacy. While
meaningful information in high-resolution TS shifts from concrete point values
to local shape-based segments, numerous research have found that long
shape-based patterns could contain more sensitive information and may
potentially be extracted and misused by a malicious third party. However, the
privacy issue for TS patterns is surprisingly seldom explored in
privacy-preserving literature. In this work, we consider a new
privacy-preserving problem: preventing malicious inference on long shape-based
patterns while preserving short segment information for the utility task
performance. To mitigate the challenge, we investigate an alternative approach
by sharing Matrix Profile (MP), which is a non-linear transformation of
original data and a versatile data structure that supports many data mining
tasks. We found that while MP can prevent concrete shape leakage, the canonical
correlation in MP index can still reveal the location of sensitive long
pattern. Based on this observation, we design two attacks named Location Attack
and Entropy Attack to extract the pattern location from MP. To further protect
MP from these two attacks, we propose a Privacy-Aware Matrix Profile (PMP) via
perturbing the local correlation and breaking the canonical correlation in MP
index vector. We evaluate our proposed PMP against baseline noise-adding
methods through quantitative analysis and real-world case studies to show the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

dead wood is of utmost interest as they are favorable indicators of

more efficient and sustainable with unprecedented accuracy in forest inventory.
However, the application of these techniques is still in its infancy with
respect to dead wood mapping. This study investigates for the first time the
automatic classification of individual coniferous trees into five decay stages
(live, declining, dead, loose bark, and clean) from combined airborne laser
scanning data and color infrared images using Machine Learning methods. First,
CIR colorized point clouds are created by fusing the ALS point clouds and the
color infrared images. Then, with the colorized point cloud, individual tree
segmentation is conducted using a semi-automatic approach, which are further
projected onto four orthogonal planes displaying the side views of the trees in
2D. Finally, the classification is conducted on the multispectral point clouds
and projected images using the three Machine Learning algorithms. All models
achieved promising results, reaching overall accuracy (OA) of up to 90.9%,
90.6%, and 80.6% for CNN, RF, and PointNet, respectively. The experimental
results reveal that the image-based approach notably outperformed the point
cloud-based one, while spectral image texture is of the highest relevance to
the success of categorizing tree decay. Our models could therefore be used for

renewing the need for durable peace agreements. In this paper, I evaluate the
economic effects of the peace agreement between the Colombian government and
the largest guerrilla group in the country, the FARC, putting an end to one of
the longest and most violent armed conflicts in recent history. Using a
difference-in-difference strategy comparing municipalities that historically
had FARC presence and those with presence of a similar, smaller guerrilla
group, the ELN, before and after the start of a unilateral ceasefire by the
FARC, I establish three sets of results. First, violence indicators
significantly and sizably decreased in historically FARC municipalities.
Second, despite this large reduction in violence, I find precisely-estimated
null effects across a variety of economic indicators, suggesting no effect of
the peace agreement on economic activity. Furthermore, I use a sharp
discontinuity in eligibility to the government's flagship business and job
creation program for conflict-affected areas to evaluate the policy's impact,
also finding precisely-estimated null effects on the same economic indicators.
Third, I present evidence that suggests the reason why historically FARC
municipalities could not reap the economic benefits from the reduction in
violence is a lack of state capacity, caused both by their low initial levels
of state capacity and the lack of state entry post-ceasefire. These results
indicate that peace agreements require complementary investments in state
capacity to yield an economic dividend.

in a transformed space of variables with a smaller dimension, leading to a

G-functions could be used to give height bounds on the moduli of smooth
projective algebraic varieties acquiring non-generic algebraic cycles. The
method was limited by the lack of a suitable cohomological interpretation for
these G-functions at finite places. In this paper we use recent developments in
$p$-adic Hodge theory to remove this constraint.
  With respect to Andr\'e's strategy for producing height bounds from algebraic
relations on $G$-function values at special points, we give a general method
for producing relations that hold at all finite places, and show that producing
relations at the infinite places is the essential difficulty. This leads to new
cases of the Zilber-Pink conjecture, as well as new height bounds on special
moduli, including the first unconditional finiteness results for CM moduli in
non-Shimura settings.
  As a more technical contribution, we introduce a refinement of the
Pila-Zannier strategy capable of handling Zilber-Pink-type atypical

asserts that the Hamiltonian of the corresponding quantum system must follow

challenges in the power distribution network. The low current magnitude and
diverse characteristics of HIFs make them difficult to be detected by
over-current relays. Recently, data-driven methods based on machine learning
models are gaining popularity in HIF detection due to their capability to learn
complex patterns from data. Most machine learning-based detection methods adopt
supervised learning techniques to distinguish HIFs from normal load conditions
by performing classifications, which rely on a large amount of data collected
during HIF. However, measurements of HIF are difficult to acquire in the real
world. As a result, the reliability and generalization of the classification
methods are limited when the load profiles and faults are not present in the
training data. Consequently, this paper proposes an unsupervised HIF detection
framework using the autoencoder and principal component analysis-based
monitoring techniques. The proposed fault detection method detects the HIF by
monitoring the changes in correlation structure within the current waveforms
that are different from the normal loads. The performance of the proposed HIF
detection method is tested using real data collected from a 4.16 kV
distribution system and compared with results from a commercially available
solution for HIF detection. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms the commercially available HIF detection technique while
maintaining high security by not falsely detecting during load conditions.

localize a specific segment according to a given sentence query. Though
respectable works have made decent achievements in this task, they severely
rely on dense video frame annotations, which require a tremendous amount of
human effort to collect. In this paper, we target another more practical and
challenging setting: one-shot temporal sentence localization (one-shot TSL),
which learns to retrieve the query information among the entire video with only
one annotated frame. Particularly, we propose an effective and novel
tree-structure baseline for one-shot TSL, called Multiple Hypotheses Segment

under the insufficient annotations. Each video frame is taken as the leaf-node,
and the adjacent frames sharing the same visual-linguistic semantics will be
merged into the upper non-leaf node for tree building. At last, each root node
is an individual segment hypothesis containing the consecutive frames of its
leaf-nodes. During the tree construction, we also introduce a pruning strategy
to eliminate the interference of query-irrelevant nodes. With our designed
self-supervised loss functions, our MHST is able to generate high-quality
segment hypotheses for ranking and selection with the query. Experiments on two
challenging datasets demonstrate that MHST achieves competitive performance

Luttinger-Ward-Eliashberg formula for the free energy in the normal state,
which includes contributions from bosons, fermions, and their interaction, all
expressed via fully dressed fermionic and bosonic propagators. The sum of the
last two contributions is the free energy $F_\gamma$ of an effective low-energy
model of fermions with boson-mediated dynamical 4-fermion interaction $V
(\Omega_m) \propto 1/|\Omega_m|^\gamma$ (the $\gamma-$model). This purely
electronic model has been used to analyze the interplay between non-Fermi
liquid (non-FL) behavior and pairing near a QCP, which are both independent of
the upper energy cutoff $\Lambda$. However, the specific heat $C_\gamma (T)$,
obtained from $F_\gamma$, does depend on $\Lambda$. We argue that this
dependence is spurious and cancels out, once we include the contribution from
bosons. We compare our $C(T)$ with the one obtained within the $\gamma-$model
using recently proposed regularization of $F_\gamma$. We argue that for $\gamma
<1$, the full $C(T)$ and the regularized $C_\gamma (T)$ differ by a
$\gamma-$dependent prefactor, while for $\gamma >1$, the full $C(T)$ is the sum
of $ C_\gamma (T)$ and the specific heat of free bosons with fully dressed
mass. For these $\gamma$, $C_\gamma (T)$ is negative. The authors of Ref. [1]
argued that a negative $ C_\gamma (T)$ implies that the normal state becomes
unstable at some distance to a QCP. In our calculation, both terms in $C(T)$
come from the same source, and $ C_\gamma (T)$ is smaller as long as vertex
corrections can be safely neglected. We then argue that the normal state

structure. It is of particular importance, especially in the light mass region,
to verify the structure change when $\Lambda$ particle(s) is added to normal
nuclei. The ground state of $^{8}$Be has been know to have a well-developed
$\alpha$--$\alpha$ cluster structure, whereasn$^{12}$C has a mixed structure of
three $\alpha$ clusters and $jj$-coupling shell model, where $\alpha$ clusters
are partially broken. Adding $\Lambda$ particle(s) could induce the structure
change. We compare the Be and C cases. Using the antisymmetrized quasi-cluster
model (AQCM), the $\alpha$-cluster states and $jj$-coupling shell-model states
of $^8$Be and $^{12}$C are prepared on the same footing, and we add $\Lambda$
particles. The cluster-shell competition in the ground state can be well
described with this model. Using AQCM, we calculate $^8$Be, $^{9}_{\Lambda}$Be,
$^{10}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$Be, $^{12}$C, $^{13}_{\Lambda}$C, and
$^{14}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$C. By adding one or two $\Lambda$ particle(s), the
ground state of $^{12}$C approaches the $jj$-coupling shell model side. On the
other hand, in the Be case, although the $\Lambda$ particle(s) shrinks the
$\alpha$--$\alpha$ distance, the breaking effect of the cluster structure is
rather limited. The spin-orbit interaction is the driving force of breaking the
$\alpha$ clusters, and whether the glue-like effect of $\Lambda$ particle(s)
attracts the cluster inside the range of this interaction is crucial. In
$^{14}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$C, the breaking of $\alpha$ clusters in $^{12}$C is
much enhanced by the addition of the $\Lambda$ particles than the case of free
$^{12}$C. We also found that breaking $\alpha$ clusters in the ground state of
$^{14}_{\Lambda\Lambda}$C affects the excited state with the pure cluster
structure.

Transformer (FRT) to address the two challenges simultaneously, which mainly
consists of visibility graph matching and feature recovery transformer. To
reduce the interference of the noise during feature matching, we mainly focus
on visible regions that appear in both images and develop a visibility graph to
calculate the similarity. In terms of the second challenge, based on the
developed graph similarity, for each query image, we propose a recovery
transformer that exploits the feature sets of its $k$-nearest neighbors in the
gallery to recover the complete features. Extensive experiments across
different person Re-ID datasets, including occluded, partial and holistic

outperforms state-of-the-art results by at least 6.2\% Rank-1 accuracy and
7.2\% mAP scores on the challenging Occluded-Duke dataset. The code is

videos. Prior methods typically generate frame-level or clip-level object
instances first and then associate them by either additional tracking heads or
complex instance matching algorithms. This explicit instance association
approach increases system complexity and fails to fully exploit temporal cues
in videos. In this paper, we design a simple, fast and yet effective
query-based framework for online VIS. Relying on an instance query and proposal
propagation mechanism with several specially developed components, this
framework can perform accurate instance association implicitly. Specifically,
we generate frame-level object instances based on a set of instance
query-proposal pairs propagated from previous frames. This instance
query-proposal pair is learned to bind with one specific object across frames
through conscientiously developed strategies. When using such a pair to predict
an object instance on the current frame, not only the generated instance is
automatically associated with its precursors on previous frames, but the model
gets a good prior for predicting the same object. In this way, we naturally
achieve implicit instance association in parallel with segmentation and
elegantly take advantage of temporal clues in videos. To show the effectiveness
of our method InsPro, we evaluate it on two popular VIS benchmarks, i.e.,
YouTube-VIS 2019 and YouTube-VIS 2021. Without bells-and-whistles, our InsPro
with ResNet-50 backbone achieves 43.2 AP and 37.6 AP on these two benchmarks

promising route towards establishing control over material phases and
functionalities. Quantum paraelectric insulators -- materials which are nearly
ferroelectric -- are particularly promising candidate systems for this purpose
since they have strongly fluctuating collective modes which directly couple to
the electric field. In this work we explore this possibility in a system
comprised of a quantum paraelectric sandwiched between two high-quality metal
mirrors, realizing a Fabry-Perot type cavity. By developing a full multimode,
continuum description we are able to study the effect of the cavity in a
spatially resolved way for a variety of system sizes and temperatures.
Surprisingly, we find that once a continuum of transverse modes are included
the cavity ends up suppressing ferroelectric correlations. This effect arises
from the screening out of transverse photons at the cavity boundaries and as a
result is confined to the surface of the paraelectric sample. We also explore
the temperature dependence of this effect and find it vanishes at high
temperatures, indicating it is a purely quantum mechanical effect. We connect
our result to calculations of Casimir and Van der Waals forces, which we argue
are closely related to the dipolar fluctuations in the quantum paraelectric.
Our results are based on a general formalism and are expected to be widely
applicable, paving the way towards studies of the quantum electrodynamics of
heterostructures featuring multiple materials and phases.

yet the trustworthiness of such research is often overlooked. While some
previous works have investigated the ability of adversarial attacks to degrade
model performance in medical imaging, the ability to falsely improve
performance via recently-developed ""enhancement attacks"" may be a greater
threat to biomedical machine learning. In the spirit of developing attacks to
better understand trustworthiness, we developed three techniques to drastically
enhance prediction performance of classifiers with minimal changes to features,
including the enhancement of 1) within-dataset predictions, 2) a particular
method over another, and 3) cross-dataset generalization. Our within-dataset
enhancement framework falsely improved classifiers' accuracy from 50% to almost
100% while maintaining high feature similarities between original and enhanced
data (Pearson's r's>0.99). Similarly, the method-specific enhancement framework
was effective in falsely improving the performance of one method over another.
For example, a simple neural network outperformed LR by 50% on our enhanced
dataset, although no performance differences were present in the original
dataset. Crucially, the original and enhanced data were still similar (r=0.95).
Finally, we demonstrated that enhancement is not specific to within-dataset
predictions but can also be adapted to enhance the generalization accuracy of
one dataset to another by up to 38%. Overall, our results suggest that more
robust data sharing and provenance tracking pipelines are necessary to maintain
data integrity in biomedical machine learning research.

humans can disguise their emotions. Recording voices or tracking facial

implementing a single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) based emotion recognition
scheme in a lightweight embedded system. However, existing schemes have
relatively low accuracy. Therefore, we propose a reliable and efficient emotion

(X - GWO - SVM) for ECG-based emotion recognition. Two datasets, one raw

demonstrates that the X - GWO - SVM algorithm can be used for emotion
recognition and the algorithm exhibits superior performance in reliability

works. It can be implemented in a lightweight embedded system, which is much
more efficient than existing solutions based on deep neural networks.

allowing to cool a resonator down to its ground state with a near-unit

qubit are utilized to reshape the target resonator from a thermal state to a
reserved Fock state. The measurement sequence is optimized by reinforcement
learning for a maximum fidelity. In the second step, the population transfer
between neighboring Fock states can be faithfully realized by the conditional
measurements on the qubit. The population over the reserved state is then
transferred in a step-by-step way toward the resonator's ground state with a
near-unit fidelity. Intrinsic nondeterminacy of the projection-based
manipulation is effectively inhibited by optimizing the measurement
time-spacing. Through our protocol with dozens of measurements, the initial
thermal average occupation can be reduced by five orders in magnitude with a

use more efficient specialized algorithms, regardless of the structure of the

The framework can, in general, produce a complement with an Emerson-Lei
acceptance condition, which can often be more compact. Using the algorithm, we
were able to establish an exponentially better new upper bound of $O(4n)$ for
complementation of the recently introduced class of elevator automata. We
implemented the algorithm in a prototype and performed a comprehensive set of

non-specific. Here, we report that lanthanide-doped nanocrystals can be
passively transported by endothelial cells and macrophages from the blood
vessels into bone marrow microenvironment. We found that this passive targeting
scheme can be effective for longer than two months. We therefore developed an
intravital 3D and high-resolution planar imaging instrumentation for bone
disease diagnosis. We demonstrated the regular monitoring of 1 mm bone defects
for over 10 days, with resolution similar to X-ray imaging result, but more
flexible use in prognosis. Moreover, the passive targeting can be used to
reveal the early onset inflammation at the joints as the synovitis in the early
stage of rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, the proposed method is comparable
to {\mu}CT in recognizing symptoms of osteoarthritis, including the mild
hyperostosis in femur which is ~100 {\mu}m thicker than normal, and the growth
of millimeter-scale osteophyte in the knee joint, which further proves the
power and universality of our approach in diagnosis of bone diseases

Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms, especially stochastic gradient Langevin
dynamics (SGLD), has scored great success in non-convex learning problems, but
one potential limitation is the computational cost caused by running multiple
chains. Upon observing that a large variance of the gradient estimator in SGLD
essentially increases the temperature of the stationary distribution, we
propose expediting tempering schemes for SGLD by directly estimating the bias
caused by the stochastic gradient estimator. This simple idea enables us to
simulate high-temperature chains at a negligible computational cost (compared
to that of the low-temperature chain) while preserving the convergence to the
target distribution. Our method is fundamentally different from the recently
proposed m-reSGLD (multi-variance replica exchange SGLD) method in that the
latter suffers from the low accuracy of the gradient estimator (e.g., the chain
can fail to converge to the target) while our method benefits from it. Further,
we derive a swapping rate that can be easily evaluated, providing another
significant improvement over m-reSGLD. To theoretically demonstrate the
advantage of our method, we develop convergence bounds in Wasserstein
distances. Numerical examples for Gaussian mixture and inverse PDE models are
also provided, which show that our method can converge quicker than the vanilla

codes (SPARCs) are a class of error correcting codes that build on ideas from
compressed sensing and can be decoded using AMP. In certain settings, SPARCs
are known to achieve capacity; yet, their performance suffers at finite block
lengths. Likewise, LDPC codes can be decoded efficiently using belief
propagation and can also be capacity achieving. This article introduces a novel
concatenated coding structure that combines an LDPC outer code with a
SPARC-inspired inner code. Efficient decoding for such a code can be achieved
using AMP with a denoiser that performs belief propagation on the factor graph
of the outer LDPC code. The proposed framework exhibits performance
improvements over SPARCs and standard LDPC codes for finite block lengths and
results in a steep waterfall in error performance, a phenomenon not observed in
uncoded SPARCs. Findings are supported by numerical results.

little work has been done to improve error-bounded lossy compression for
Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) simulation data. Unlike the previous work that
only leverages 1D compression, in this work, we propose an approach (TAC) to

To remove the data redundancy across different levels, we propose several
pre-process strategies and adaptively use them based on the data

encoding stage of SZ compression to efficiently handle many small AMR data
blocks after the pre-processing. Experiments on 8 AMR datasets from a
real-world large-scale AMR simulation demonstrate that TAC+ can improve the
compression ratio by up to 4.9X under the same data distortion, compared to the
state-of-the-art method. In addition, we leverage the flexibility of our

biological interpretability and high energy efficiency. With the introduction
of the backpropagation algorithm and surrogate gradient, the structure of
spiking neural networks has become more complex, and the performance gap with
artificial neural networks has gradually decreased. However, most SNN hardware
implementations for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) cannot meet
arithmetic or memory efficiency requirements, which significantly restricts the
development of SNNs. They do not delve into the arithmetic operations between
the binary spikes and synaptic weights or assume unlimited on-chip RAM
resources by using overly expensive devices on small tasks. To improve
arithmetic efficiency, we analyze the neural dynamics of spiking neurons,
generalize the SNN arithmetic operation to the multiplex-accumulate operation,
and propose a high-performance implementation of such operation by utilizing
the DSP48E2 hard block in Xilinx Ultrascale FPGAs. To improve memory
efficiency, we design a memory system to enable efficient synaptic weights and
membrane voltage memory access with reasonable on-chip RAM consumption.
Combining the above two improvements, we propose an FPGA accelerator that can
process spikes generated by the firing neuron on-the-fly (FireFly). FireFly is
the first SNN accelerator that incorporates DSP optimization techniques into
SNN synaptic operations. FireFly is implemented on several FPGA edge devices
with limited resources but still guarantees a peak performance of 5.53TOP/s at

which the Convolutional Long and Short Time Memory (ConvLSTM) network
aggregated the Spatio-temporal features of the adjacent multi-frame small
moving object and the Path Aggregation Network (PAN) located the suspicious

suspicious small objects and calculate their Motion Range (MR). At the same
time, the size of the MR of the suspicious small moving object is adjusted
adaptively according to its speed of movement (specifically, if the object
moves slowly, its MR will be expanded according to the speed of the object to
ensure the necessary environmental information of the object). Adaptive
Spatio-temporal Cubes (ASt-Cubes) of the small moving objects are generated to
ensure that the SNR of the moving objects is improved, and the necessary
environmental information is retained adaptively. Finally, a LightWeight

spaceborne hyperspectral data. This study provides a quantitative assessment on
the ability of DESIS hyperspectral data for predicting plant species richness
in two different habitat types in southeast Australia. Spectral features were
first extracted from the DESIS spectra, then regressed against on-ground
estimates of plant species richness, with a two-fold cross validation scheme to
assess the predictive performance. We tested and compared the effectiveness of
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and
Partial Least Squares analysis (PLS) for feature extraction, and Kernel Ridge
Regression (KRR), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Random Forest Regression
(RFR) for species richness prediction. The best prediction results were r=0.76
and RMSE=5.89 for the Southern Tablelands region, and r=0.68 and RMSE=5.95 for
the Snowy Mountains region. Relative importance analysis for the DESIS spectral
bands showed that the red-edge, red, and blue spectral regions were more
important for predicting plant species richness than the green bands and the
near-infrared bands beyond red-edge. We also found that the DESIS hyperspectral
data performed better than Sentinel-2 multispectral data in the prediction of
plant species richness. Our results provide a quantitative reference for future
studies exploring the potential of spaceborne hyperspectral data for plant
biodiversity mapping.

reinforcement learning (MARL), especially for partially-observed tasks.
However, existing works either broadcast the messages leading to information
redundancy, or learn targeted communication by modeling all the other agents as
targets, which is not scalable when the number of agents varies. In this work,
to tackle the scalability problem of MARL communication for partially-observed
tasks, we propose a novel framework Transformer-based Email Mechanism (TEM).
The agents adopt local communication to send messages only to the ones that can
be observed without modeling all the agents. Inspired by human cooperation with
email forwarding, we design message chains to forward information to cooperate
with the agents outside the observation range. We introduce Transformer to
encode and decode the message chain to choose the next receiver selectively.
Empirically, TEM outperforms the baselines on multiple cooperative MARL
benchmarks. When the number of agents varies, TEM maintains superior
performance without further training.

validated by the observed amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) at 645 nm with a
narrow linewidth around 1 nm from the pentacene-doped p-terphenyl crystal used
for masing at 1.45 GHz and consolidated by a 20 fold lower threshold of ASE

convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are effective solutions. The features
extracted from activation layer of pre-trained CNNs are called deep
convolutional activation features (DeCAF). In this paper, we have analyzed that
all DeCAF features are not necessarily led to a higher accuracy in the

different dimension reduction methods are applied to achieve an effective
combination of features by capturing the essence of DeCAF features. To this

deep features and lead to a higher accuracy in the classification task using
small number of features considering specific amount of cumulative explained

infall rate derived from H$^{13}$CO$^+$ $J=1-0$ blue profile is of the same
order of magnitude as the filamentary mass inflow rate, approximately 1 $\rm
M_\odot$ kyr$^{-1}$. A photodissociation region (PDR) covering the irradiated
clump surface is detected in several molecules, such as CCH, HCO$^+$, and CS
whereas the spatial distribution stratification of these molecules is
indistinct. CCH spectra of the PDR possibly indicate a photoevaporation flow
leaving the clump surface with a projected velocity of $\sim2$ km s$^{-1}$. Our
new observations show that RDI accompanied by a clump-fed process is operating
in this massive BRC. Whether this combined process works in other massive BRCs
is worth exploring with dedicated surveys.

quality-factor elements (also called ``constant-$Q$'' transverse isotropy) are
often used to describe attenuation anisotropy in sedimentary rocks. The
attenuation coefficients in constant-$Q$ TI models can be conveniently defined
in terms of the Thomsen-type attenuation-anisotropy parameters. Recent research
indicates that not all those parameters for such constant-$Q$ media are
frequency-independent. Here, we present concise analytic formulae for the
Thomsen-type attenuation parameters for Kjartansson's constant-$Q$ TI model and
show that one of them ($\delta_{Q}$) varies with frequency. The analytic
expression for $\delta_{Q}$ helps evaluate the frequency dependence of the
normalized attenuation coefficients of P- and SV-waves by introducing the newly
defined ``dispersion factors''. Viscoacoustic constant-$Q$ transverse isotropy
is also discussed as a special case, for which the elliptical condition and
simplified expressions for the parameters $\delta$ and $\delta_{Q}$ are
derived. Our results show that in the presence of significant absorption the
attenuation coefficients of the ``constant-$Q$'' model vary with frequency for
oblique propagation with respect to the symmetry axis. This variation needs to
be taken into account when applying the spectral-ratio method and other
attenuation-analysis techniques.

US data and meaningful annotation to enable bone segmentation and registration

spinal surgery, the scarcity of intra-operative clinical US data is an
insurmountable bottleneck in training a neural network. Moreover, due to the
characteristics of US imaging, it is difficult to clearly annotate bone
surfaces which causes the trained neural network missing its attention to the
details. Hence, we propose an In silico bone US simulation framework that
synthesizes realistic US images from diagnostic CT volume. Afterward, using
these simulated bone US we train a lightweight vision transformer model that
can achieve accurate and on-the-fly bone segmentation for spinal sonography. In
the validation experiments, the realistic US simulation was conducted by
deriving from diagnostic spinal CT volume to facilitate a radiation-free
US-guided pedicle screw placement procedure. When it is employed for training
bone segmentation task, the Chamfer distance achieves 0.599mm; when it is
applied for CT-US registration, the associated bone segmentation accuracy
achieves 0.93 in Dice, and the registration accuracy based on the segmented
point cloud is 0.13~3.37mm in a complication-free manner. While bone US images
exhibit strong echoes at the medium interface, it may enable the model
indistinguishable between thin interfaces and bone surfaces by simply relying
on small neighborhood information. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose
to utilize a Long-range Contrast Learning Module to fully explore the
Long-range Contrast between the candidates and their surrounding pixels.

of observed quasars at high redshift, but additionally because of the current
lack of observations of intermediate mass black holes. One plausible scenario
for creating supermassive black holes is direct collapse triggered by the
merger of two gas rich galaxies. This scenario allows the creation of
supermassive stars with solar metallicity, where the enhanced metallicity is
enabled by extremely rapid accretion. We investigate the behavior of metal
enriched supermassive stars which collapse due to the general relativistic
radial instability during hydrogen burning. These stars contain both hydrogen
and metals and thus may explode due to the CNO cycle (carbon-nitrogen-oxygen)
and the rp process (rapid proton capture). We perform a suite of stellar
evolution simulations for a range of masses and metallicities, both including
and neglecting mass loss. We evaluate the stability of these supermassive stars
by solving the pulsation equation in general relativity. When the stars becomes
unstable, we perform 1D general relativistic hydrodynamical simulations coupled
to a 153 isotope nuclear network with cooling from neutrino reactions, in order
to determine if the stars explode. If the stars do explode, we post process the
nucleosynthesis using a 514 isotope network which includes additional proton
rich isotopes. These explosions are characterized by enhanced nitrogen and
intermediate mass elements ($16\geq\rm{A}\geq25$), and suppressed light
elements ($8\geq\rm{A}\geq14$), and we comment on recent observations of
super-solar nitrogen in GN-z11.

a simple and compact polarimetric self-coherent receiver based on a thin

Gaia EDR3 data. We detect four bright and hot blue straggler stars (BSSs) and
two yellow straggler stars (YSSs) based on their location in the optical and
FUV-optical color-magnitude diagrams. Based on the parameters estimated using
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED), we infer that BSSs are either collisional
products or might have undetectable white dwarf (WD) companions. Our
photometric analysis of YSSs confirms their binarity, consistent with the
spectroscopic results. We find YSSs to be formed through a mass-transfer
scenario and the hot components are likely to be A-type subdwarfs. A comparison
of the radial velocity (RV), Gaia EDR3 proper motion of the PN with the
cluster, and reddening towards the PN and the cluster does not rule out the
membership of the PN. Comparing the central star's position with theoretical
pAGB models suggest that it has already entered the WD cooling phase, and its
mass is deduced to be ~0.66Msun. The corresponding progenitor mass turns out to
be ~2.1Msun, comparable to the turn-off mass of the cluster, implying that the
progenitor could have formed in the cluster. We suggest that the NGC 2818 might
be one of the few known clusters to host a PN, providing a unique opportunity
to test stellar evolution models.

exchange-correlation functionals from LDA to hybrids and basis sets from plane

honeycomb, 2D square, 2D hexagonal, and 3D bulk metallic systems, we compare
the DFT attributes using bond lengths, cohesive energies, elastic constants,

on 2D metals use plane waves, our comparisons reveal that local basis with
often-used PBE exchange-correlation is well sufficient for most purposes, while
plane waves and hybrid functionals bring limited improvement compared to the
greatly increased computational cost. These results ease the demands for
generating DFT data for better interaction with experiments and for data-driven

neglect this trajectory characteristic that they usually follow image-language

video-language tasks. Moreover, previous VDL-BERTs usually uniformly sample a
few frames into the model while different trajectories have diverse graininess,
i.e., some trajectories span longer frames and some span shorter, and using a
few frames will lose certain useful temporal contexts. However, simply sampling
more frames will also make pre-training infeasible due to the largely increased
training burdens. To alleviate the problem, during the fine-tuning stage, we
insert a novel Hierarchical Frame-Selector (HFS) module into the video encoder.
HFS gradually selects the suitable frames conditioned on the text context for
the later cross-modal encoder to learn better trajectory-word alignments. By
the proposed T2W attention and HFS, our TW-BERT achieves SOTA performances on

(\textbf{ACF}) to generate captions. We use this name since each layer of ACF
can adaptively cluster input elements to carry self-attention (Self-ATT) for
learning local context. Compared with other global-local Transformers which
carry Self-ATT in fixed-size windows, ACF can capture varying graininess, \eg,
an object may cover different numbers of grids or a phrase may contain diverse
numbers of words. To build ACF, we insert a probabilistic matrix C into the
Self-ATT layer. For an input sequence {{s}_1,...,{s}_N , C_{i,j} softly
determines whether the sub-sequence {s_i,...,s_j} should be clustered for
carrying Self-ATT. For implementation, {C}_{i,j} is calculated from the
contexts of {{s}_i,...,{s}_j}, thus ACF can exploit the input itself to decide
which local contexts should be learned. By using ACF to build the vision
encoder and language decoder, the captioning model can automatically discover
the hidden structures in both vision and language, which encourages the model
to learn a unified structural space for transferring more structural
commonalities. The experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of ACF that
we achieve CIDEr of 137.8, which outperforms most SOTA captioning models and
achieve comparable scores compared with some BERT-based models. The code will
be available in the supplementary material.

  adaptation","AAAI 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In few-shot unsupervised domain adaptation (FS-UDA), most existing methods
followed the few-shot learning (FSL) methods to leverage the low-level local
features (learned from conventional convolutional models, e.g., ResNet) for
classification. However, the goal of FS-UDA and FSL are relevant yet distinct,
since FS-UDA aims to classify the samples in target domain rather than source
domain. We found that the local features are insufficient to FS-UDA, which
could introduce noise or bias against classification, and not be used to
effectively align the domains. To address the above issues, we aim to refine
the local features to be more discriminative and relevant to classification.
Thus, we propose a novel task-specific semantic feature learning method (TSECS)
for FS-UDA. TSECS learns high-level semantic features for image-to-class
similarity measurement. Based on the high-level features, we design a
cross-domain self-training strategy to leverage the few labeled samples in
source domain to build the classifier in target domain. In addition, we
minimize the KL divergence of the high-level feature distributions between
source and target domains to shorten the distance of the samples between the
two domains. Extensive experiments on DomainNet show that the proposed method
significantly outperforms SOTA methods in FS-UDA by a large margin (i.e., 10%).

double-peaked broad H$\alpha$ (Type-1.9 DPAGN) coming from central accretion
disk. Type-1.9 AGN without broad H$\beta$ can be expected by the commonly
accepted unified model of AGN, considering central BLRs seriously obscured by
dust torus with its upper boundary in the line of sight. For the unique
Type-1.9 DPAGN, accretion disk originations of double-peaked broad H$\alpha$
can be applied to determine the inclination angle of the central accretion
disk, which is well accepted as substitute of the half opening angle of the
central dust torus. Then, among low redshift Type-1.9 DPAGN in SDSS, SDSS
J1607+3319 at redshift 0.063 is collected, and the half opening angle of the
central dust torus is determined to be around 46$\pm$4\degr, after considering
disfavoured BBH system to explain the double-peaked broad H$\alpha$ through
long-term none variabilities and disfavoured local physical conditions to
explain disappearance of broad H$\beta$ through virial BH mass properties. The
results indicate that more detailed studying on dust torus of AGN can be
appropriately done through Type-1.9 DPAGN in the near future.

the phase of stalled shock, immediately after the birth of a proto-neutron star
(PNS). We assess the effect of stellar rotation on neutrino-driven convection
and SASI when neutrino heating is taken into account. Rotation affects the
frequency of the mode m=2 detectable with gravitational waves (GW). We use a
linear stability analysis in the equatorial plane between the PNS and the
stationary shock and consider a large range of specific angular momenta,
neutrino luminosities and mass accretion rates. The nature of the dominant
instability depends on the convection parameter chi and the rotation rate.
Convective modes with chi>=5 are hampered by differential rotation. At smaller
chi, however, mixed SASI-convective modes with a large angular scale m=1,2,3
benefit from rotation and become dominant for relatively low rotation rates at
which centrifugal effects are small. For rotation rates >0.3 Keplerian rotation
at the PNS surface (KPNS), the growth rate of the dominant mode depends weakly
on neutrino heating which highlights a new instability regime. Its frequency is
surprisingly independent of the heating rate, with a strong prograde spiral m=2
dominating over a large parameter range, favourable to the production of GW. A
simple linear relation exists between the dominant oscillation frequency and
the specific angular momentum. Three regimes are distinguished. For rotation
rates <0.1KPNS, differential rotation has a quadratic effect on equatorial
purely convective modes and a linear destabilizing effect on SASI. Intermediate
rotation rates (0.1 to 0.3KPNS) lead to the emergence of mixed
SASI/convection/rotation modes involving large angular scales. Finally, strong
rotation erases the influence of buoyancy on the instability. This allows for a
reduction of the parameter space, which is valuable for GW analysis.

quantities for several types of chiral multifold fermions, including spin-1/2
as well as pseudospin-1 and -3/2 fermions, dubbed as Kramers Weyl, triple point

symmorphic model to describe the triple point fermions (TPF). We also consider
the more realistic model Hamiltonian for the CoSi family including both linear
and quadratic terms. We find that circular injection currents are quantized as
a result of the Chern numbers carried by the multifold fermions within the
linear models. Surprisingly, we discover that in the TPF model, linear shift
conductivities are proportional to the pseudo spin-orbit coupling and
independent of photon frequency. In contrast, for the RSW and Kramer Weyl

frequency. The numerical results agree with the power-counting analysis for
quadratic Hamiltonians. The frequency independence of the linear shift
conductivity could be attributed to the strong resonant symplectic Christoffel

of detecting unknown objects substantially reduces the model's ability to
detect known ones. (ii) The PLM does not adequately utilize the priori

subconsciously prefer to focus on all foreground objects and then identify each

Control Problems with random inputs in a Reduced Order Model (ROM) context. All
the simulations are initially based on a finite element method (FEM)
discretization; moreover, a space-time approach is considered when dealing with
unsteady cases. To overcome numerical instabilities that can occur in the
optimality system for high values of the P\'eclet number, we consider a
Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin technique applied in an
optimize-then-discretize approach. We combine this method with the ROM
framework in order to consider two possibilities of stabilization: Offline-Only
stabilization and Offline-Online stabilization. Moreover, we consider random
parameters and we use a weighted Proper Orthogonal Decomposition algorithm in a
partitioned approach to deal with the issue of uncertainty quantification.
Several quadrature techniques are used to derive weighted ROMs: tensor rules,
isotropic sparse grids, Monte-Carlo and quasi Monte-Carlo methods. We compare
all the approaches analyzing relative errors between the FEM and ROM solutions
and the computational efficiency based on the speedup-index.

  Distance Computation",,,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The computation of the distance of two time series is time-consuming for any
elastic distance function that accounts for misalignments. Among those
functions, DTW is the most prominent. However, a recent extensive evaluation
has shown that the move-split merge (MSM) metric is superior to DTW regarding
the analytical accuracy of the 1-NN classifier. Unfortunately, the running time
of the standard dynamic programming algorithm for MSM distance computation is
$\Omega(n^2)$, where $n$ is the length of the longest time series. In this
paper, we provide approaches to reducing the cost of MSM distance computations
by using lower and upper bounds for early pruning paths in the underlying
dynamic programming table. For the case of one time series being a constant, we
present a linear-time algorithm. In addition, we propose new linear-time
heuristics and adapt heuristics known from DTW to computing the MSM distance.
One heuristic employs the metric property of MSM and the previously introduced
linear-time algorithm. Our experimental studies demonstrate substantial
speed-ups in our approaches compared to previous MSM algorithms. In particular,
the running time for MSM is faster than a state-of-the-art DTW distance
computation for a majority of the popular UCR data sets.

error in the measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. An
HWP can also be used to measure circular polarization (CP) through its optical
leakage from CP to linear polarization. The CP of the CMB is predicted to be
produced by interactions in the Universe, such as interactions with supernova
remnants of population III stars. Thus, the observation of the CP of CMB is a
new tool for searching for population III stars. In this paper, we demonstrate
the improved measurement of the leakage coefficient using the transmission
spectrum measurement of an actual HWP in the laboratory. We measured the
transmittance of linearly polarized light through the HWP used in the
\textsc{Polarbear} experiment in the frequency range of
\SIrange{120}{160}{GHz}. We evaluate properties of the HWP by fitting the data
with a physical model using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. We then
estimate the band-averaged CP leakage coefficient using the physical model. We
find that the leakage coefficient strongly depends on the spectra of CP
sources. We thus calculate the maximum rate of leakage from CP to linear
polarization as $0.133 \pm 0.009$ in the Rayleigh--Jeans spectrum. The nonzero
value shows that \textsc{Polarbear} would have sensitivity to the CP.
Additionally, because we use the bandpass of detectors installed in the
telescope to calculate the band-averaged values, we also consider systematic
effects in the experiment.

two-terminal ion-based memristors are complementary to each other in various
nonconventional information processing systems in a heterogeneous integration
approach, such as hybrid CMOS/memristive neuromorphic crossbar arrays. Recent
attempts to introduce transitive functions into memristors have given rise to
gate-tunable memristive functions, hetero-plasticity and mixed-plasticity
functions. However, it remains elusive under what application scenarios and in
what ways transistors can benefit from the incorporation of ion-based
memristive effects. Here, we introduce a new type of transistor named 'mempolar
transistor' to the transistor family. Its polarity can be converted reversibly,
in a nonvolatile fashion, between n-type and p-type depending on the history of
the applied electrical stimulus. This is achieved by the use of the emerging
semiconducting tellurium as the electrochemically active source/drain contact
material, in combination with monolayer two-dimensional MoS2 channel, which
results in a gated lateral Te/MoS2/Te memristor, or from a different
perspective, a transistor whose channel can be converted reversibly between
n-type MoS2 and p-type Te. With this unique mempolar function, our transistor
holds the promise for reconfigurable logic circuits and secure circuits. In
addition, we propose and demonstrate experimentally, a ternary
content-addressable memory made of only two mempolar transistors, which used to
require a dozen normal transistors, and by simulations, a device-inspired and
hardware matched regularization method 'FlipWeight' for training artificial
neural networks, which can achieve comparable performance to that achieved by
the prevalent 'Dropout' and 'DropConnect' methods. This work represents a major
advance in diversifying the functionality of transistors.

a base station (BS) first extracts semantic information from its large-scale
data, and then transmits the small-sized semantic information to each user
which recovers the original data based on its local common knowledge. At the BS
side, the probability graph is used to extract multi-level semantic
information. In the downlink transmission, a rate splitting scheme is adopted,
while the private small-sized semantic information is transmitted through
private message and the common knowledge is transmitted through common message.
Due to limited wireless resource, both computation energy and transmission
energy are considered. This joint computation and communication problem is
formulated as an optimization problem aiming to minimize the total
communication and computation energy consumption of the network under
computation, latency, and transmit power constraints. To solve this problem, an
alternating algorithm is proposed where the closed-form solutions for semantic
information extraction ratio and computation frequency are obtained at each
step. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

future. Surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) is a
suitable method for investigating these processes because it can monitor with
chemical specificity the mechanisms of the reactions. However, it remains
difficult to detect many relevant aspects of electrochemical reactions such as
short-lived intermediates. Here, we develop and experimentally realize an
integrated nanophotonic-electrochemical SEIRAS platform for the in situ
investigation of molecular signal traces emerging during electrochemical
experiments. Specifically, we implement a platinum nano-slot metasurface
featuring strongly enhanced electromagnetic near fields and spectrally target
it at the weak vibrational bending mode of adsorbed CO at ~2033 cm-1.
Crucially, our platinum nano-slot metasurface provides high molecular
sensitivity. The resonances can be tuned over a broad range in the mid-infrared
spectrum. Compared to conventional unstructured platinum layers, our
nanophotonic-electrochemical platform delivers a substantial improvement of the
experimentally detected characteristic absorption signals by a factor of 27,
enabling the detection of new species with weak signals, fast conversions, or
low surface concentrations. By providing a deeper understanding of catalytic
reactions, we anticipate our nanophotonic-electrochemical platform to open
exciting perspectives for electrochemical SEIRAS, surface-enhanced Raman
spectroscopy, and the study of reactions in other fields of chemistry such as
photoelectrocatalysis.

stellar mass ($M_*$), evolves over cosmic time. However, such studies often
rely on photometric redshifts and/or only rest-frame UV to near-IR data, which
may underestimate the SFR and $M_*$ uncertainties. We use MAGPHYS+photo-z to
fit the UV to radio spectral energy distributions of 12,380 galaxies in the
COSMOS field at $0.5<z<3.0$ and self-consistently include photometric redshift
uncertainties on the derived SFR and $M_*$. We quantify the effect on the
observed MS scatter from (1) photometric redshift uncertainties (which are
minor) and (2) fitting only rest-frame ultraviolet to near-infrared
observations (which are severe). At fixed redshift and $M_*$, we find that the
intrinsic MS scatter for our sample of galaxies is 1.4 to 2.6 times larger than
the measurement uncertainty. The average intrinsic MS scatter has decreased by
0.1 dex from $z=0.5$ to $\sim2.0$. At low-$z$, the trend between the intrinsic
MS scatter and $M_*$ follows a functional form similar to an inverse stellar
mass-halo mass relation (SMHM; $M_*$/$M_{\rm halo}$ vs $M_*$), with a minimum
in intrinsic MS scatter at log($M_*/M_{\odot})\sim10.25$ and larger scatter at
both lower and higher $M_*$; while this distribution becomes flatter for
high-$z$. The SMHM is thought to be a consequence of feedback effects and this
similarity may suggest a link between galaxy feedback and the intrinsic MS
scatter. These results favor a slight evolution in the intrinsic MS scatter
with both redshift and mass.

we establish different regimes depending on the commensurability of the

better capture the complex relationship between CGM observables and underlying
gas conditions. We train random forest models on synthetic spectra for \HI and
selected metal lines around galaxies across a range of star formation rates,
stellar masses, and impact parameters, to predict absorber overdensities,
temperatures, and metallicities. The models reproduce the true values from
Simba well, with transverse standard deviations of $0.2-0.3$ dex in
overdensity, $0.14-0.2$ dex in temperature, and $0.16-0.2$ dex in metallicity
predicted from metal lines (not HI), across all ions. Examining the feature
importance, the random forest indicates that the overdensity is most informed
by the absorber column density, the temperature is driven by the line width,
and the metallicity is most sensitive to the specific star formation rate.
Alternatively examining feature importance by removing one observable at a
time, the overdensity and metallicity appear to be more driven by the impact
parameter. We introduce a normalising transform approach in order to ensure the
scatter in the true physical conditions is accurately spanned by the network.

power-efficient asynchronous design that is not synced to a global clock.
Finite-rate-of-innovation (FRI) signals, ubiquitous in various applications,
have fewer degrees of freedom than the signal's Nyquist rate, enabling
sub-Nyquist sampling signal models. This work proposes a power-efficient IF-TEM
ADC architecture and demonstrates sub-Nyquist sampling and FRI signal recovery.
Using an IF-TEM, we implement in hardware the first sub-Nyquist time-based
sampler. We offer a feasible approach for accurately estimating the FRI
parameters from IF-TEM data. The suggested hardware and reconstruction approach
retrieves FRI parameters with an error of up to -25dB while operating at rates
approximately 10 times lower than the Nyquist rate, paving the way to low-power
ADC architectures.

The asymmetries provide access to the transversity distribution functions via a

existing measurements as well as to model predictions. Asymmetries of
$\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ pairs measured with the proton target as a function of the

in the present work using an unsteady Darcy equation for the porous layer. An
expression for the perturbation energy exchange term between the fluid and

porous layer which is then used to prove the propositions. The necessary and
sufficient condition for the existence of the instability in flows through
cylindrical geometries is shown to be $\frac{d}{dr} \left( \frac{r
\frac{dV}{dr}}{n^2+k^2 r^2} \right) (V-V_I)<0$ somewhere in the flow where $V$
and $V_I$ are the axisymmetric base-state velocity profile and velocity at the
fluid-porous layer interface, respectively. The parameters, $k$ and $n$ are the
axial and azimuthal wavenumbers, respectively. Additionally, the bounds on the
phase speed ($c_r$) and growth rate ($k c_i$) are derived.
  The derived propositions are used to determine the stability of the sliding
Couette, annular Poiseuille, and Hagen-Poiseuille flows with a porous wall. The
analysis reveals, for the first time, the existence of both axisymmetric

linearly stable. Therefore, the instability predicted here is solely due to the
porous nature of the wall. The mechanism responsible for the predicted
instability is the exchange of the perturbation energy between the fluid and
porous layers.

features efficiently. In addition, we note that existing Transformers usually
explore all similarities of the tokens between the queries and keys for the
feature aggregation. However, not all the tokens from the queries are relevant
to those in keys, using all the similarities does not effectively facilitate
the high-resolution image reconstruction. To overcome this problem, we develop
a sparse global self-attention (SparseGSA) module to select the most useful
similarity values so that the most useful global features can be better
utilized for the high-resolution image reconstruction. We develop a hybrid
dynamic-Transformer block(HDTB) that integrates the MHDLSA and SparseGSA for
both local and global feature exploration. To ease the network training, we
formulate the HDTBs into a residual hybrid dynamic-Transformer group (RHDTG).

essential non-invasive imaging method for detecting deficits of myocardial
blood flow, allowing the assessment of coronary heart disease. Nevertheless,
acquisitions suffer from relatively low spatial resolution and limited heart
coverage. Compressed sensing (CS) methods have been proposed to accelerate
FPP-CMR and achieve higher spatial resolution. However, the long reconstruction
times have limited the widespread clinical use of CS in FPP-CMR. Deep learning
techniques based on supervised learning have emerged as alternatives for
speeding up reconstructions. However, these approaches require fully sampled
data for training, which is not possible to obtain, particularly
high-resolution FPP-CMR images. Here, we propose a physics-informed
self-supervised deep learning FPP-CMR reconstruction approach for accelerating
FPP-CMR scans and hence facilitate high spatial resolution imaging. The
proposed method provides high-quality FPP-CMR images from 10x undersampled data
without using fully sampled reference data.

coronal holes and are thought to play a key role in the transfer of mass and
energy into the solar corona. We describe unique contemporaneous observations
of a coronal blowout jet seen by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager onboard the
Solar Orbiter spacecraft (SO/EUI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/AIA). The coronal jet erupted from the
south polar coronal hole, and was observed with high spatial and temporal
resolution by both instruments. This enabled identification of the different
stages of a breakout reconnection process producing the observed jet. We find
bulk plasma flow kinematics of ~100-200 km/s across the lifetime of its
observed propagation, with a distinct kink in the jet where it impacted and was
subsequently guided by a nearby polar plume. We also identify a faint faster
feature ahead of the bulk plasma motion propagating with a velocity of ~715
km/s which we attribute to untwisting of newly reconnected field lines during
the eruption. A Differential Emission Measure (DEM) analysis using the SDO/AIA
observations revealed a very weak jet signal, indicating that the erupting
material was likely much cooler than the coronal passbands used to derive the
DEM. This is consistent with the very bright appearance of the jet in the
Lyman-$\alpha$ passband observed by SO/EUI. The DEM was used to estimate the
radiative thermal energy of the source region of the coronal jet, finding a
value of $\sim2\times10^{24}$ ergs, comparable to the energy of a nanoflare.

correlations whose presence and nature are hidden from conventional
crystallographic probes. This hidden order can sometimes be controlled, but its
importance for physical properties of materials is not well understood. Using
simple models for electronic and interatomic interactions, we show how crystals
with identical average structures but different types of hidden order can have
very different electronic and phononic band structures. Increasing the strength
of local correlations within hidden-order states can open band gaps and tune
mode (de)localisation -- both mechanisms allowing for fundamental changes in
physical properties without long-range symmetry breaking. Taken together, our
results demonstrate how control over hidden order offers a new mechanism for
tuning material properties, orthogonal to the conventional principles of
(ordered) structure/property relationships.

the adversarial robustness of machine learning models, including Graph Neural

that exploit the message-passing principle of GNNs: We randomly intercept
messages and carefully analyze the probability that messages from adversarially
controlled nodes reach their target nodes. Compared to existing certificates,
we certify robustness to much stronger adversaries that control entire nodes in
the graph and can arbitrarily manipulate node features. Our certificates
provide stronger guarantees for attacks at larger distances, as messages from
farther-away nodes are more likely to get intercepted. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on various models and datasets. Since our gray-box
certificates consider the underlying graph structure, we can significantly
improve certifiable robustness by applying graph sparsification.

Transition Region (TR) heating are still to be determined. Aims: Our aim is to
derive the statistical thermal evolution of these events in order to establish
their coronal or TR origin. Methods. Our thermal analysis takes advantage of
the multithermal sensitivity of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) imager
on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We first identified these HRIEUV
events in the six coronal bands of AIA. We then performed a statistical time
lag analysis, which quantifies the delays between the light curves from
different bands. These time lags can give significant insights into the
temperature evolution of these events. The analysis is performed taking into
account the possible contribution to the results from the background and
foreground emissions. Results: The events are characterized by time lags
inferior to the AIA cadence of 12 s, for all nine couples of AIA bands
analyzed. Our interpretation is the possible co-presence of events which reach
or do not reach coronal temperatures ($\approx$ 1MK). We believe that the cool
population dominates the events analyzed in this work.

property that the $n$ cyclic shifts of every given codeword are all distinct,

also known as optical orthogonal codes (OOCs). HCCs and OOCs have various
practical applications and have been studied extensively over the years.
  The main concern of this paper is to present improved Gilbert-Varshamov type
lower bounds for these codes, when the minimum distance is bounded below by a
linear factor of the code length. For HCCs, we improve the previously best
known lower bound of Niu, Xing, and Yuan by a linear factor of the code length.
For OOCs, we improve the previously best known lower bound of Chung, Salehi,

by-products, we also provide improved lower bounds for frequency hopping
sequences sets and error-correcting weakly mutually uncorrelated codes. Our
proofs are based on tools from probability theory and graph theory, in
particular the McDiarmid's inequality on the concentration of Lipschitz
functions and the independence number of locally sparse graphs.

  Over-the-Air Computation Systems",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The performance of over-the-air computation (AirComp) systems degrades due to
the hostile channel conditions of wireless devices (WDs), which can be
significantly improved by the employment of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
(RISs). However, the conventional RISs require that the WDs have to be located
in the half-plane of the reflection space, which restricts their potential
benefits. To address this issue, the novel family of simultaneously
transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS) is
considered in AirComp systems to improve the computation accuracy across a wide
coverage area. To minimize the computation mean-squared-error (MSE) in STAR-RIS
assisted AirComp systems, we propose a joint beamforming design for optimizing
both the transmit power at the WDs, as well as the passive reflect and transmit
beamforming matrices at the STAR-RIS, and the receive beamforming vector at the
fusion center (FC). Specifically, in the updates of the passive reflect and
transmit beamforming matrices, closed-form solutions are derived by introducing
an auxiliary variable and exploiting the coupled binary phase-shift conditions.
Moreover, by assuming that the number of antennas at the FC and that of
elements at the STAR-RIS/RIS are sufficiently high, we theoretically prove that
the STAR-RIS assisted AirComp systems provide higher computation accuracy than
the conventional RIS assisted systems. Our numerical results show that the
proposed beamforming design outperforms the benchmark schemes relying on random
phase-shift constraints and the deployment of conventional RIS. Moreover, its
performance is close to the lower bound achieved by the beamforming design
based on the STAR-RIS dispensing with coupled phase-shift constraints.

exist some relevant proxies for the unobserved common confounders. Unlike
typical proxies, our proxies can have a direct effect on the endogenous
regressor and the outcome. We provide point identification results with a
linearly separable outcome model in the disturbance, and alternatively with
strict monotonicity in the first stage. Using this novel method with NLS97
data, we demonstrate the insignificant role of ability bias compared to general
selection bias in the economic returns to education problem. Beyond economics,
the approach is just as relevant in health treatment evaluation with an
unobserved underlying health status, or a psychological study where character
traits are unobserved common confounders.

Quantum
benchmarking methods provide key information on noise properties for quantum

However, current benchmarking methods, such as randomized benchmarking or its

quantum gates. Moreover, due to the randomization inherent in these protocols,
the figure of merit they actually measure is not the fidelity of individual
target gate but the average of the fidelities of some random circuit cycles
incorporating the target. To overcome these limits, we propose channel spectrum
benchmarking (CSB), a method to infer the noise properties of the target
quantum process, such as process fidelity, from the eigenvalues of its noisy
quantum channel. The noisy eigenvalues can be estimated by the circuits of
control-free phase estimation in a state-preparation and measurement
error-resilient manner. Our method can benchmark universal quantum processes
and is scalable to many-qubit quantum processes. We demonstrate the performance
of our method using simulated experiments, including the single-qubit Pauli

Toffoli gate, and a 10-qubit cycle implementing the Ising Hamiltonian evolution

traditionally conceived as a depiction of the world itself. Ontology is also
described using conceptual modeling (CM) that defines fundamental concepts of
reality. CM is one of the central activities in computer science, especially as
it is mainly used in software engineering as an intermediate artifact for
system construction. To achieve such a goal, we propose Stoic CM (SCM) as a
description of what a system must do functionally with minimal ambiguity. As a
case study, we apply SCM to investigate the ontology of BPMN (business process
modeling notation). Such an undertaking would demonstrate SCM notions and
simultaneously may offer a viable ontological foundation for BPMN. SCM defines
the being of things and actions in reality based on Stoic notions of existence
and subsistence. It has two levels of specification: (1) a subsistence static
model where things and actions subsist and (2) an existence dynamic model where
things and actions exist in time. From the Stoic ontological point of view,
while a thing existing has a clear denotation, subsistence indicates the thing
is being there, but it is inactive (does not participate in an event). We apply
SCM to BPMN processes that involve buying a new car with many notions, such as
activity, task, event, and message. The result indicates that SCM produces a
tighter representation of reality, thus providing the necessary description of
the part in the application world to be used as requirements for developing the

these systems are safe to use, they undergo elaborate and expensive empirical

from clarity in comparison to that of the second-order or continuous QPT, in
which the order parameter and associated broken symmetry can be clearly
identified and at the same time the concepts of universality class and critical
scaling can be characterized by critical exponents. Here we present a compared
study of these two kinds of QPT in the transverse Ising model. In the absence
of a longitudinal field, the ground state of the model exhibits a second-order
QPT from paramagnetic phase to ferromagnetic one, which is smeared out once the
longitudinal field is applied. Surprisingly, the first excited state involves a
first-order QPT as the longitudinal field increases, which has not been
reported in literature. Within the framework of a pattern picture we clearly
identify the difference between these two kinds of QPT: for the continuous QPT
only the pattern flavoring ferromagnetic phase is always dominant over the
others, and on the contrary, there exist at least two competitive patterns in
the first-order QPT, which is further indicated by patterns' occupancies
calculated by pattern projections on the ground and first excited states
wavefunctions. Our result has not only a fundamental significance in the
understandings of the nature of QPTs, but also a practical interest in quantum
simulations used to test the present finding.

by inducing the sparsity in point-wise self-attentions for LTTF, the limited
information utilization prohibits the model from exploring the complex

is proposed on top of sliding-window attention and Stationary and Instant
Recurrent Network (SIRN); (ii) a module derived from the normalizing flow is
devised to further improve the information utilization by inferring the outputs

downstream self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on seven real-world

LTTF and generates reliable prediction results with uncertainty quantification.

transferring images to styles unseen in training. This is useful for medical
imaging, where images are acquired using different protocols and different
scanner models, resulting in a variety of styles that data may need to be
transferred between. Methods: Our model disentangles image content from style
and can modify an image's style by simply replacing the style encoding with one
extracted from a single image of the target style, with no additional
optimization required. This also allows the model to distinguish between
different styles of images, including among those that were unseen in training.
We propose a formal description of the proposed model. Results: Experimental
results on breast magnetic resonance images indicate the effectiveness of our
method for style transfer. Conclusion: Our style transfer method allows for the

understanding models. With language emerging as a key driver towards powerful
generalization, it is imperative for foundational video-language models to have
a sense of time. In this paper, we consider a specific aspect of temporal
understanding: consistency of time order as elicited by before/after relations.
We establish that seven existing video-language models struggle to understand
even such simple temporal relations. We then question whether it is feasible to
equip these foundational models with temporal awareness without re-training
them from scratch. Towards this, we propose a temporal adaptation recipe on top
of one such model, VideoCLIP, based on post-pretraining on a small amount of
video-text data. We conduct a zero-shot evaluation of the adapted models on six
datasets for three downstream tasks which require varying degrees of time
awareness. We observe encouraging performance gains especially when the task
needs higher time awareness. Our work serves as a first step towards probing
and instilling a sense of time in existing video-language models without the
need for data and compute-intense training from scratch.

remaining low dimension. However, planning within the reduced-order space
unavoidably constrains the full model, and hence we sacrifice the full
potential of the robot. In the community of legged locomotion, this has lead to
a search for better model extensions, but many of these extensions require
human intuition, and there has not existed a principled way of evaluating the
model performance and discovering new models. In this work, we propose a model
optimization algorithm that automatically synthesizes reduced-order models,
optimal with respect to any user-specified cost function. To demonstrate our
work, we optimized models for a bipedal robot Cassie. We show in hardware

confirmed by measuring the radiative thermal conductance between two silicon

present a consistent view of a sample of 17 nearby cool evolved stars
(Aymptotic Giant Branch and red supergiant stars).
  Methods. Here we present VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL polarimetric maps obtained in the
visible of 14 out of the 17 ATOMIUM sources. They were obtained
contemporaneously with the ALMA high spatial resolution data. To help interpret
the polarized signal, we produced synthetic maps of light scattering by dust,
through 3D radiative transfer simulations with the RADMC3D code.
  Results. The degree of linear polarization (DoLP) observed by ZIMPOL spreads
across several optical filters. We infer that it primarily probes dust located
just outside of the point spread function, and in or near the plane of the sky,
with a total optical depth close to unity in the line of sight, representing
only a fraction of the total circumstellar dust. The maximum DoLP ranges from
0.03-0.38 depending on the source, fractions that can be reproduced by our 3D
pilot models for grains composed of common dust species. The spatial structure
of the DoLP shows a diverse set of shapes. Only for three sources do we note a
correlation between the ALMA CO and SiO lines, which trace the gas density, and
the DoLP, which traces the dust.
  Conclusion. The clumpiness of the DoLP and the lack of a consistent
correlation between the gas and the dust location show that, in the inner
circumstellar environment (CSE), dust formation occurs at very specific sites.
This has potential consequences for the derived mass-loss rates and dust-to-gas
ratio in the inner region of the CSE. Except for $\pi^1$~Gru and perhaps GY
Aql, we do not detect interactions between the circumstellar wind and the
hypothesized companions that shape the wind at larger scales. This suggests
that the orbits of any other companions are tilted out of the plane of the sky.

transition mediated by an auxiliary central qubit (c-qubit). The c-qubit is
coupled to a spin-$1/2$ Ising model with local Ising interactions and tunable
c-qubit-spin coupling. Each spin becomes next-nearest neighbor to all others
through the c-qubit, which mediates effective all-to-all interactions. As the
interaction with the c-spin increases, we find a surprising transition from
super-ballistic scrambling and information growth to continuously restricted
sub-ballistic entanglement and operator growth. This slow growth occurs on
intermediate timescales that extend exponentially with increasing coupling and
system size, indicative of logarithmic entanglement growth. We find that in the
slow-scrambling regime, the c-qubit Ising interaction allows commuting
operators to grow support on all sites rapidly, while operators orthogonal to
the interaction become echoed out. This projects local operators to lie in a
restricted subspace and prevents extensive operator entanglement growth. We
provide exact dynamics of small systems working with non-equilibrium, effective
infinite temperature states, and additionally contribute analytic early-time

propose DepthP+P, a method that learns to estimate outputs in metric scale by
following the traditional planar parallax paradigm. We first align the two
frames using a common ground plane which removes the effect of the rotation
component in the camera motion. With two neural networks, we predict the depth
and the camera translation, which is easier to predict alone compared to
predicting it together with rotation. By assuming a known camera height, we can
then calculate the induced 2D image motion of a 3D point and use it for
reconstructing the target image in a self-supervised monocular approach. We
perform experiments on the KITTI driving dataset and show that the planar
parallax approach, which only needs to predict camera translation, can be a
metrically accurate alternative to the current methods that rely on estimating
6DoF camera motion.

digital identities to facilitate complete control over their own data is
paramount to Web 3.0. The accounting system on blockchain is an ideal archetype
for realizing Web 3.0 decentralized identity: users can create their accounts
without registering with a central agent. Such an identity system is endowed
with anonymity property: nobody knows the account's owner because the
relationship between an account and the owner is invisible. Thus, user privacy
is well protected even though the account's data is public. However, a
disadvantage of such complete anonymity is that users can create multiple
accounts without authentication to obfuscate their activities on the
blockchain. In particular, the current anonymous blockchain account system
cannot accurately register the social relationships and interactions between
real human users, given the amorphous mappings between users and blockchain
identities. Mistrust can be a major hurdle to the large-scale deployment of Web
3.0. This work proposes ZKBID, a zero-knowledge blockchain-account-based Web
3.0 decentralized identity scheme, to overcome endemic mistrust in blockchain
account systems. ZKBID links souls (blockchain accounts) to humans (users) in a
one-to-one manner to truly reflect the societal relationships and interactions
between humans on the blockchain. With ZKBID, the users are accountable for
their accounts anonymously, preserving privacy. ZKBID authenticates users using
face match and then maps authenticated users to accounts. Zero-knowledge proofs
encode the face match results, and user-account mappings employ linkable ring
signatures to preserve anonymity. We implemented ZKBID and built a blockchain
test network for evaluation purposes. Our tests demonstrate the effectiveness
of ZKBID and suggest proper ways to configure ZKBID system parameters.

quantum technologies over their classical counterparts. Such superiority,
however, can be diminished due to unavoidable noise and decoherence of the
probe. Thus, metrological strategies to fight against or profit from
decoherence are highly desirable. This is the case of certain types of
decoherence-driven many-body systems supporting dissipative phase transitions,
which might be helpful for sensing. Boundary time crystals are exotic
dissipative phases of matter in which the time-translational symmetry is
broken, and long-lasting oscillations emerge in open quantum systems at the
thermodynamic limit. We show that the transition from a symmetry unbroken into
a boundary time crystal phase, described by a second-order transition, reveals
quantum-enhanced sensitivity quantified through quantum Fisher information. We
have also determined the critical exponents of the system and established their
relationship. Our scheme is indeed a demonstration of harnessing decoherence
for achieving quantum-enhanced sensitivity. From a practical perspective, it
has the advantage of being independent of initialization and can be captured by
a simple measurement.

skyrmion in the large $N_c$ limit and there is a robust topology change in the
skyrmion matter approach to dense nuclear matter. The hidden scale and local
flavor symmetries which are sources introducing the lightest scalar meson --
dilaton -- and lowest lying vector mesons into to nonlinear chiral effective
theory are seen to play important roles in understanding the nuclear force. We
review in this paper the generalized nuclear effective theory (G$n$EFT), which
applicable to nuclear matter from low density to the compact star density,
constructed with the robust conclusion from the topology approach to dense
matter and emergent scale and hidden local flavor symmetries. The topology
change at density larger than two times saturation density $n_0$ encoded in the
parameters of the effective field theory is interpreted as the hadron-quark
continuity in the sense of Cheshire Cat Principle. A novel feature predicted in
this theory that has not been found before is the precocious appearance of the
conformal sound velocity in the cores of massive stars, although the trace of
the energy-momentum tensor of the system is not zero. That is, in contrast to
the usual picture, the cores of massive stars are composed of quasiparticles of
fractional baryon charges, neither baryons nor deconfined quarks. Hidden scale
and local flavor symmetries emerge and give rise a resolution of the
longstanding $g_A$ quench problem in nuclei transition. To illustrate the
rationality of the GnEFT, we finally confront the generalized effective field
theory to the global properties of neutron star and the data from gravitational
wave detections.

the goal is to incorporate selected apparel into a given input image. Most
existing techniques, known as Virtual Try-On methods, deal with this task by
first selecting an example image of the desired apparel and then transferring
the clothing onto the target person. Conversely, in this paper, we consider
editing fashion images with text descriptions. Such an approach has several
advantages over example-based virtual try-on techniques, e.g.: (i) it does not
require an image of the target fashion item, and (ii) it allows the expression
of a wide variety of visual concepts through the use of natural language.
Existing image-editing methods that work with language inputs are heavily
constrained by their requirement for training sets with rich attribute
annotations or they are only able to handle simple text descriptions. We
address these constraints by proposing a novel text-conditioned editing model,
called FICE (Fashion Image CLIP Editing), capable of handling a wide variety of
diverse text descriptions to guide the editing procedure. Specifically with
FICE, we augment the common GAN inversion process by including semantic,
pose-related, and image-level constraints when generating images. We leverage
the capabilities of the CLIP model to enforce the semantics, due to its
impressive image-text association capabilities. We furthermore propose a
latent-code regularization technique that provides the means to better control
the fidelity of the synthesized images. We validate FICE through rigorous
experiments on a combination of VITON images and Fashion-Gen text descriptions
and in comparison with several state-of-the-art text-conditioned image editing
approaches. Experimental results demonstrate FICE generates highly realistic
fashion images and leads to stronger editing performance than existing
competing approaches.

exceeding 19% in organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the open-circuit voltage
of OSCs remains low relative to their optical gap due to excessive
non-radiative recombination, and this now limits performance. Here, we consider
an important aspect of OSC design, namely management of the triplet exciton
population formed after non-geminate charge recombination. By comparing the
blends PM6:Y11 and PM6:Y6, we show that the greater crystallinity of the NFA
domains in PM6:Y11 leads to a higher rate of triplet-triplet annihilation
(TTA). We attribute this to the four times larger ground state dipole moment of
Y11 versus Y6, which improves the long range NFA out-of-plane ordering. Since
TTA converts a fraction of the non-emissive triplet states into bright singlet
states, it has the potential to reduce non-radiative voltage losses. Through a
kinetic analysis of the recombination processes under 1-Sun illumination, we
provide a framework for determining the conditions under which TTA may improve
OSC performance. If these could be satisfied, TTA has the potential to reduce

It is the target of the DART and
HERA space missions. The primary body, Didymos, rotates close to the spin at
which it is expected to shed mass. The secondary body, Dimorphos, is a 140
meters moon that orbits the primary body in about 12 hours. Here we investigate
the possible origin of Dimorphos. Using 1D models of ring/satellite
interactions, we study the evolution of material lost from Didymos' surface and
deposited as a ring at its equator. We find that due to viscous spreading, the
ring spreads outside the Didymos' Roche limit forming moonlets. A fraction of
the mass will form Dimorphos and a set of objects near the Roche limit, while
most of the ring's mass falls back on Didymos. To match the properties of
today's Dimorphos, the total mass that must be deposited in the ring is about
25% of Didymos' mass. It is possible that a fraction of the material travelled
several times between the ring and the surface of Didymos. The models produce
an orbit similar to that observed for a Didymos tidal parameter k2/Q<1e-5. If
the ring deposition timescale is long (>100 yr) (so the material flux is small)
Dimorphos could be irregularly shaped as it forms from the collision of
similar-sized satellitesimals. However, the top-shape of Didymos is expected to
be achieved due to a fast spin-up of the asteroid, which would result in a
short deposition timescale (<yr). In that case, the satellite would form from
progressively accreting material at the Roche Limit, resulting in an
ellipsoidal Dimorphos constructed of small pieces with sizes of the order of
meters, which is apparently in agreement with the recent images of Dimorphos
obtained by DART mission.

on data poisoning (DP). In contrast to previous attacks, both the poison and
the trigger in our method are stealthy. We are able to change the model's
classification of samples from a source class to a target class chosen by the
attacker. We do so by using a small number of poisoned training samples with
nearly imperceptible perturbations, without changing their labels. At inference
time, we use a stealthy perturbation added to the attacked samples as a
trigger. This perturbation is crafted as a universal adversarial perturbation
(UAP), and the poison is crafted using gradient alignment coupled to this
trigger. Our method is highly efficient in crafting time compared to previous
methods and requires only a trained surrogate model without additional
retraining. Our attack achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of attack
success rate while maintaining high accuracy on clean samples.

of the model, the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio stand in
good agreement with data. Also, by reconstructing the potential in terms of the
scalar field, the validity of the swampland criteria is considered. The results
indicate that to have a scalar field below the Planck mass, the parameter
$\lambda$ should be at least of the order of $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$. The same
order of $\lambda$ is required to keep the gradient of the potential greater
than one and satisfy the second conjecture of the swampland criteria.

predators. Prey are generally thought to escape in a direction that is either
random or serves to maximize the minimum distance from the predator. Here we
introduce a comprehensive approach to determine the most likely evasion
strategy among multiple hypotheses and the role of biomechanical constraints on
the escape response of prey fish. Through a consideration of six strategies
with sensorimotor noise and previous kinematic measurements, our analysis shows
that zebrafish larvae generally escape in a direction orthogonal to the
predator's heading. By sensing only the predator's heading, this orthogonal
strategy maximizes the distance from fast-moving predators, and, when operating
within the biomechanical constraints of the escape response, it provides the
best predictions of prey behavior among all alternatives. This work
demonstrates a framework for resolving the strategic basis of evastion in
predator-prey interactions, which could be applied to a broad diversity of
animals.

neurophysiological health of people, and have a direct link to the general
well-being and quality of life. Standard clinical practices rely on
polysomnography for sleep assessment; however, it is intrusive, performed in
unfamiliar environments and requires trained personnel. Progress has been made
on less invasive sensor technologies, such as actigraphy, but clinical
validation raises concerns over their reliability and precision. Additionally,
the field lacks a widely acceptable algorithm, with proposed approaches ranging
from raw signal or feature thresholding to data-hungry classification models,
many of which are unfamiliar to medical staff. This paper proposes an online
Bayesian probabilistic framework for objective (in)activity detection and
segmentation based on clinically meaningful joint kinematics, measured by a
custom-made wearable sensor. Intuitive three-dimensional visualisations of
kinematic timeseries were accomplished through dimension reduction based
preprocessing, offering out-of-the-box framework explainability potentially
useful for clinical monitoring and diagnosis. The proposed framework attained
up to 99.2\% $F_1$-score and 0.96 Pearson's correlation coefficient in,
respectively, the posture change detection and inactivity segmentation tasks.
The work paves the way for a reliable home-based analysis of movements during
sleep which would serve patient-centred longitudinal care plans.

micropyramids consisting of soot nano-particles are formed on the surface of
graphitized hollow filaments, which are resistively heated to
~1800$^\circ$C-2400$^\circ$C in an Ar atmosphere containing trace amounts of
oxygen (~300 p.p.m.). At the higher temperatures (T>2300$^\circ$C,
approximately) the soot particles are represented mainly by multi-shell carbon
nano-onions. The height and the width of the pyramids is strongly dependent on
the temperature of the resistive heating, diminishing from 5-10mkm at
T=1800$^\circ$C to 1mkm at 2300-2400$^\circ$C. Quasi-hexagonal arrays of the
micropyramids are organized in the convex ``craters'' on the surface of the
microtubes, which grow with the time of the thermal treatment. The pyramids are
pointing always normally to the surface of the craters, except at the
boundaries between the craters, where the normal direction is not well defined.
The pyramids are soft and can be easy destroyed by touching them, but can be
hardened by heating them in the oxygen-free atmosphere. The pyramids are
observed only on the exterior surface of the microtubes, but not on their inner
surface. This suggests that the thermophoretic force generated by a strong
temperature gradient near the external surface of the tubes may be the cause of
the micropyramids formation. Electrostatic charging of the soot nanoparticles
due to thermionic emission may also be relevant to this phenomenon. The
micropyramids can function as field emission point sources, as demonstrated
with the use of a micro-nanoprobing station, mounted in a scanning electron
microscope.

exploits two basic mechanisms: (a) reliance on dynamic dispatch at the core of
language translation, and (b) extreme abstraction of libraries, to generate an
abstraction of the code. We demonstrate the efficiency and usefulness of
Serenity's analysis in two applications: code completion and automated machine

The relation between Schrodinger's equations and Madelung equations are often
debated with the observation that no clear understanding exists for why the
additional rotational discretisation condition is required. Here I explain it
as an additional gauge symmetry that speaks in favour of the recent idea that
quantum is gauge (Q=G). Indeed, this additional symmetry seems to emerge as a
gauge symmetry condition that needs to be incorporated in the Madelung
equations in order to properly describe quantum mechanics. In that sense
""Madelung Equation + Gauge symmetry = Quantum mechanics"". Arguments in favour
of understanding the quantum phase as a gauge symmetry component of the
solution of Schrodinger's equations are also introduced.

exhibits conductances in the order of nanosiemens over distances of many
nanometers and macroscopic Ohm's law emerges. Here, we investigate this
emergent phenomenon via the framework of many-body (fermionic) quantum
statistical principles. We propose a simple model which gives rise to an Ohm's
law with vanishing quantum effects in its thermodynamic limit (with respect to
length scales). Specifically, we consider protein-ligand complexes as a
two-band 1D lattice Hamiltonian system in which charge carriers (electrons or
holes) are assumed to be quasi-free. We investigate theoretically and
numerically the behavior of the microscopic current densities with respect to
varying voltage, temperature and length within reasonable physiological
parameter ranges. We compute the current observable at each site of the
protein-ligand lattice and demonstrate how the local microscopic charge
transport behavior generates the macroscopic current. The overall framework
contributes to the search for unifying principles for long-range charge
transport and associated emergent laws in protein complexes, which is crucial
for bioelectronics.

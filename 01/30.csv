their highly rough and non-convex energy landscape, with wide applications in
the fields of drug design, materials discovery, and mechanics. Here, we present
a graph reinforcement learning approach, StriderNET, that learns a policy to
displace the atoms towards low energy configurations. We evaluate the
performance of StriderNET on three complex atomic systems, namely, binary
Lennard-Jones particles, calcium silicate hydrates gel, and disordered silicon.
We show that StriderNET outperforms all classical optimization algorithms and
enables the discovery of a lower energy minimum. In addition, StriderNET
exhibits a higher rate of reaching minima with energies, as confirmed by the
average over multiple realizations. Finally, we show that StriderNET exhibits
inductivity to unseen system sizes that are an order of magnitude different
from the training system.

distinguish two types of picture-valued invariants: derivations (Turaev
bracker, index polynomial etc.) and functorial maps (Kauffman bracket, parity
bracket, parity projection etc.). We consider some examples of binary
functorial maps.
  Besides known cases of functorial maps, we present two new examples. The
order functorial map is closely connected with (pre)orderings of surface groups
and leads to the notion of sibling knots, i.e. knots such that any diagram of
one knot can be transformed to a diagram of the other by crossing switching.
The other is the lifting map which is inverse to forgetting of
under-overcrossings information which turns virtual knots into flat knots. We
give some examples of liftable flat knots and flattable virtual knots.

electrostatic barrier in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. By way
of the transfer matrix method and using the continuity conditions at the
different interfaces, transmission probability is determined. Additional
resonances appear for two-band tunneling and at normal incidence, and their
number is proportional to the value of $U_4$ in cases where $U_2<U_4$ is
present. However, when $U_2>U_4$, anti-Klein tunneling increases with $U_2$.
The transmission probability exhibits an interesting oscillatory behavior when
$U_3>U_2=U_4$ and $U_3 <U_2=U_4$. For fixed energy $E=0.39\gamma_1$, increasing
barrier widths increases the number of oscillations and decreases Klein
tunneling. An interlayer bias creates a gap for: $U_2<U_3<U_4$ and
$U_3>U_2=U_4$. In the four-band tunneling case, transmission decreases in
$T^+_+$, $T^-_+$ and $T^-_-$ channels in comparison with the single barrier
case. It does, however, increase for $T^+_-$ when compared to the single
barrier case. Transmission is suppressed in the gap region when an interlayer
bias is introduced. Our results are relevant for electron confinements in AB
bilayer graphene and for the development of graphene-based transistors.

made it possible to predict structures of novel protein sequences, the

by the rare interactions within the target mass of the detector. The efficiency
of such a veto detector should be better than 99.99% and false positive rate of

  The CMVD is being built using extruded plastic scintillator (EPS) strips to
detect and tag atmospheric muons. More than 700 EPS strips are required to
build the CMVD. Two EPS strips are pasted together to make a di-counter (DC)
and wavelength shifting fibres are embedded inside the EPS strips to trap the
scintillation light generated by a passing cosmic ray muon and transmit it as
secondary photons to the Silicon Photo-Multipliers (SiPMs) mounted at the two

rather high, it is imperative to thoroughly test each and every component used

as a linear optimal output regulation problem, in which the feedback-forward
optimal controller is used to track a class of references and rejecting a class
of disturbances while maintaining the overall system's closed-loop stability.
The optimal control problem is presented using a data-driven reinforcement
learning based method to regulate the relative position and velocity of the
deputy to safely dock with the chief. Using the adaptive optimal output
regulation framework, the learned optimal feedback-feedforward gains guarantee
optimal transient and steady state performances without any prior knowledge of

(Cauchy coefficients) which is sufficient for experimentally relevant
wavelengths below the first resonant frequency. In the proposed theoretical
framework, all known physical effects including the relativistic, quantum
electrodynamics, finite nuclear mass, and finite nuclear size corrections are
accounted for. We obtained $\alpha_0=11.0763(19)$ for the static polarizability

dispersion coefficients, respectively. The result obtained for the static
polarizability agrees (within the estimated uncertainty) with the most recent
experimental data [C. Gaiser and B. Fellmuth, Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 123203

work appear to be most accurate in the literature, improving by more than an
order of magnitude upon previous estimates. By combining the experimentally
determined value of the static polarizability with the dispersion coefficients
from our calculations, the polarizability of argon can be calculated with
accuracy of around $10\,$ppm for wavelengths above roughly $450\,$nm. This
result is important from the point of view of quantum metrology, especially for
a new pressure standard based on thermophysical properties of gaseous argon.
Additionally, in this work we calculate the static magnetic susceptibility of
argon which relates the refractive index of dilute argon gas with its pressure.
While our results for this quantity are less accurate than in the case of the
polarizability, they can provide, via Lorenz-Lorentz formula, the best

most existing BEV solutions either require considerable resources to execute
on-vehicle inference or suffer from modest performance. This paper proposes a
simple yet effective framework, termed Fast-BEV , which is capable of
performing faster BEV perception on the on-vehicle chips. Towards this goal, we
first empirically find that the BEV representation can be sufficiently powerful
without expensive transformer based transformation nor depth representation.
Our Fast-BEV consists of five parts, We novelly propose (1) a lightweight
deployment-friendly view transformation which fast transfers 2D image feature
to 3D voxel space, (2) an multi-scale image encoder which leverages multi-scale
information for better performance, (3) an efficient BEV encoder which is
particularly designed to speed up on-vehicle inference. We further introduce
(4) a strong data augmentation strategy for both image and BEV space to avoid
over-fitting, (5) a multi-frame feature fusion mechanism to leverage the
temporal information. Through experiments, on 2080Ti platform, our R50 model
can run 52.6 FPS with 47.3% NDS on the nuScenes validation set, exceeding the
41.3 FPS and 47.5% NDS of the BEVDepth-R50 model and 30.2 FPS and 45.7% NDS of

competitive 53.5% NDS on the nuScenes validation set. We further develop a
benchmark with considerable accuracy and efficiency on current popular
on-vehicle chips. The code is released at:

Krivine-Stengle Positivstellensatz fails to hold in the state polynomial
setting. Further, archimedean Positivstellens\""atze in the spirit of Putinar

relaxations converging monotonically to the optimum of a state polynomial
subject to state constraints. This hierarchy can be seen as a state analog of
the Lasserre hierarchy for optimization of polynomials, and the
Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in scheme for optimization of noncommutative
polynomials. The motivation behind this theory arises from the study of
correlations in quantum networks. Determining the maximal quantum violation of
a polynomial Bell inequality for an arbitrary network is reformulated as a
state polynomial optimization problem. Several examples of quadratic Bell
inequalities in the bipartite and the bilocal tripartite scenario are analyzed.
To reduce the size of the constructed SDPs, sparsity, sign symmetry and

obtain the above-mentioned results, techniques from noncommutative algebra,

  Discovered Dynamic $\mu$-Topics",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Creating a taxonomy of interests is expensive and human-effort intensive: not
only do we need to identify nodes and interconnect them, in order to use the
taxonomy, we must also connect the nodes to relevant entities such as users,
pins, and queries. Connecting to entities is challenging because of ambiguities
inherent to language but also because individual interests are dynamic and
evolve. Here, we offer an alternative approach that begins with bottom-up
discovery of $\mu$-topics called pincepts. The discovery process itself
connects these $\mu$-topics dynamically with relevant queries, pins, and users
at high precision, automatically adapting to shifting interests. Pincepts cover
all areas of user interest and automatically adjust to the specificity of user
interests and are thus suitable for the creation of various kinds of
taxonomies. Human experts associate taxonomy nodes with $\mu$-topics (on
average, 3 $\mu$-topics per node), and the $\mu$-topics offer a high-level data
layer that allows quick definition, immediate inspection, and easy
modification. Even more powerfully, $\mu$-topics allow easy exploration of
nearby semantic space, enabling curators to spot and fill gaps. Curators'
domain knowledge is heavily leveraged and we thus don't need untrained
mechanical Turks, allowing further cost reduction. These $\mu$-topics thus
offer a satisfactory ""symbolic"" stratum over which to define taxonomies. We
have successfully applied this technique for very rapidly iterating on and
launching the home decor and fashion styles taxonomy for style-based
personalization, prominently featured at the top of Pinterest search results,
at 94% precision, improving search success rate by 34.8% as well as boosting
long clicks and pin saves.

paper aims to improve the service delay and Quality of Service (QoS) by
introducing HPCDF (Hybrid PSO-CRO Delay-improved for FogPlan) - an offline
QoS-aware framework to deploy and release fog services dynamically. The
proposed method provisions, i.e., deploy and release fog services to reduce
service delay, based on the aggregated incoming traffic to each fog node. We
formulate a cost function as an Integer Non-Linear Programming (INLP) problem
by considering each service attributes, including required resources and
associated traffic. This problem integrates storage, processing, deployment,
communication costs, delay violation, high fog utilization reward, high traffic
nodes cost, and service delay penalty. A hybrid binary PSO-CRO (Particle Swarm
and Chemical Reaction Optimization) algorithm is proposed to achieve the lowest
service delay and QoS loss to address this problem. The evaluation is performed
on real-world traffic traces, provided by MAWI Working Group, under three
different experiments to study the impact of various parameters of the hybrid
binary PSO-CRO algorithm and the proposed framework on service delay. The
evaluation results reveal that our proposed algorithm reduces service delay by
29.34%, service cost by 66.02%, and violates the delay 50.15% less in

systematically study the production mechanisms of DM at multi-TeV muon

that at least 9 channels for DM production can be very efficient in testing DM

and underestimating the model performance (e.g., ImageNet-A). To mitigate these
problems, we introduce a new test set, called D2O, which is sufficiently
different from existing test sets. Images are a mix of generated images as well
as images crawled from the web. They are diverse, unmodified, and
representative of real-world scenarios and cause state-of-the-art models to
misclassify them with high confidence. To emphasize generalization, our dataset
by design does not come paired with a training set. It contains 8,060 images
spread across 36 categories, out of which 29 appear in ImageNet. The best Top-1
accuracy on our dataset is around 60% which is much lower than 91% best Top-1
accuracy on ImageNet. We find that popular vision APIs perform very poorly in
detecting objects over D2O categories such as ``faces'', ``cars'', and
``cats''. Our dataset also comes with a ``miscellaneous'' category, over which
we test the image tagging models. Overall, our investigations demonstrate that
the D2O test set contain a mix of images with varied levels of difficulty and
is predictive of the average-case performance of models. It can challenge

progress in computer vision. These advancements have been applied to other
areas, such as remote sensing and have shown satisfactory results. However, the
lack of large labeled datasets and the inherent complexity of remote sensing
problems have made it difficult to train deep CNNs for dense prediction
problems. To solve this issue, ImageNet pretrained weights have been used as a
starting point in various dense predictions tasks. Although this type of
transfer learning has led to improvements, the domain difference between
natural and remote sensing images has also limited the performance of deep
CNNs. On the other hand, self-supervised learning methods for learning visual
representations from large unlabeled images have grown substantially over the
past two years. Accordingly, in this paper we have explored the effectiveness
of in-domain representations in both supervised and self-supervised forms to
solve the domain difference between remote sensing and the ImageNet dataset.
The obtained weights from remote sensing images are utilized as initial weights
for solving semantic segmentation and object detection tasks and
state-of-the-art results are obtained. For self-supervised pre-training, we
have utilized the SimSiam algorithm as it is simple and does not need huge
computational resources. One of the most influential factors in acquiring
general visual representations from remote sensing images is the pre-training
dataset. To examine the effect of the pre-training dataset, equal-sized remote
sensing datasets are used for pre-training. Our results have demonstrated that
using datasets with a high spatial resolution for self-supervised

theoretically investigating the simplest system that can produce the same

partition moves quasistatically from one end of the box to the other, allowing
the system to remain in equilibrium with a reservoir throughout the process.
The partition and the boundaries are impenetrable by particles, forming two
effectively interconnected regions. Position of the partition becomes the shape
variable. We investigate quantum shape effect on the thermodynamic properties
of confined particles. In addition, we applied a new analytical model based on
dimensional transitions to accurately predict thermodynamic properties under
the quantum shape effect. A fundamental understanding of quantum shape effects

policies, prescribe treatment assignment probabilities using the same decision
function over stages, where the decision is based on the same set of features

for clean accuracy and is not robust in general, this accuracy-robustness
trade-off can be significantly alleviated. We show that the robust base
classifier's confidence difference for correct and incorrect examples is the

f_*\Omega^{\bullet}_{E^{\natural}/S}(\log \pi^{-1}Z)$. In particular, we prove
that the residue exact sequence in degree one splits canonically, and we derive
the formality of $\mathcal{A}$. When $S$ is smooth over a field $k$ of
characteristic zero, we prove that sections of $\mathcal{A}^1$ admit canonical
lifts to absolute logarithmic differentials in
$f_*\Omega^1_{E^{\natural}/k}(\log \pi^{-1}Z)$. This extends a well known
property for regular differentials given by the 'crystalline nature' of
universal vector extensions.
  Using the formalism of bar complexes and their relative versions, we apply
the above results to give a new, purely algebraic, construction of the
so-called universal elliptic KZB connection in arbitrary level. We compute
explicit analytic formulae, and we compare our results with previous approaches
to elliptic KZB equations and multiple elliptic polylogarithms in the
literature.

learning approaches (SGRLs), by transforming link prediction to graph
classification on the subgraphs around the links, have achieved
state-of-the-art performance in link prediction. However, SGRLs are
computationally expensive, and not scalable to large-scale graphs due to
expensive subgraph-level operations. To unlock the scalability of SGRLs, we
propose a new class of SGRLs, that we call Scalable Simplified SGRL (S3GRL).
Aimed at faster training and inference, S3GRL simplifies the message passing
and aggregation operations in each link's subgraph. S3GRL, as a scalability
framework, accommodates various subgraph sampling strategies and diffusion
operators to emulate computationally-expensive SGRLs. We propose multiple
instances of S3GRL and empirically study them on small to large-scale graphs.
Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed S3GRL models scale up
SGRLs without significant performance compromise (even with considerable gains
in some cases), while offering substantially lower computational footprints
(e.g., multi-fold inference and training speedup).

performance gap between high and low-resource languages in many downstream
tasks. And cross-lingual retrieval models built on such pre-trained models can
inherit language bias, leading to suboptimal result for low-resource languages.
Moreover, unlike the English-to-English retrieval task, where large-scale

only needs bitext data for distillation training, which is more feasible for

C-axis out-of-plane textured Sb thin films were successfully deposited on

suitable surface termination for the growth of Sb thin films on amorphous
substrates. The deposition parameters were fine-tuned, and the growth was

  Bidirectional programming promises that we can reverse flow of software, and

risk reporting and large scale distributed error tracking.
  Since processing of risk reports and data analysis pipelines can be

along multiple dimensions.
  We also present a description to better communicate how the complete

  This approach can also be described as an generalization of axiomatic
theories of accounting into

idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), the Cobb angle is measured on X-ray images of the

scoliosis may lead to negative side effects on patients. Furthermore, manual
measurement of the Cobb angle could lead to up to 10{\deg} or more of a
difference due to intra/inter observer variation. Therefore, the objective of
this study is to identify the Cobb angle by developing an automated
radiation-free model, using Machine learning algorithms. Methods: Thirty
participants with lumbar/thoracolumbar AIS (15{\deg} < Cobb angle < 66{\deg})
performed gait cycles. The lumbosacral (L5-S1) joint efforts during six gait
cycles of participants were used as features to feed training algorithms.
Various regression algorithms were implemented and run. Results: The decision
tree regression algorithm achieved the best result with the mean absolute error
equal to 4.6{\deg} of averaged 10-fold cross-validation. Conclusions: This
study shows that the lumbosacral joint efforts during gait as radiation-free

\textit{Model Confidence LS} and \textit{Human Confidence LS}, to achieve
better model calibration and generalization. To enhance model generalization,
we show how our model and human confidence scores can be successfully applied

Engineering is a promising means to control quantum systems on an ultrafast
timescale. However, the ultrafast switching on/off of the driving field comes
with questions regarding the limits of validity of the Floquet formalism, which
is defined for an infinite periodic drive, and to what extent the transient
changes can be driven adibatically. Experimentally addressing these questions
has been difficult, in large part due to the absence of an established
technique to measure coherent dynamics through the duration of the pulse. Here,
using multidimensional coherent spectroscopy we explicitly excite, control, and
probe a coherent superposition of excitons in the $K$ and $K^\prime$ valleys in
monolayer WS$_2$. With a circularly polarized, red-detuned, pump pulse, the
degeneracy of the $K$ and $K^\prime$ excitons can be lifted and the phase of
the coherence rotated. We demonstrate phase rotations during the 100 fs driving
pulse that exceed $\pi$, and show that this can be described by a combination
of the AC-Stark shift of excitons in one valley and Bloch-Siegert shift of
excitons in the opposite valley. Despite showing a smooth evolution of the
phase that directly follows the intensity envelope of the pump pulse, the
process is not perfectly adiabatic. By measuring the magnitude of the
macroscopic coherence as it evolves before, during, and after the pump pulse we
show that there is additional decoherence caused by power broadening in the
presence of the pump. This non-adiabaticity may be a problem for many
applications, such as manipulating q-bits in quantum information processing,
however these measurements also suggest ways such effects can be minimised or
eliminated.

early times of liquid hydrocarbon fuel injection at supercritical pressure. A
sharp two-phase interface is sustained before substantial heating of the
liquid. Thus, two-phase dynamics has been shown to drive the early
three-dimensional deformation and atomisation. A recent study of a
transcritical liquid jet shows distinct deformation features caused by
interface thermodynamics, low surface tension, and intraphase diffusive mixing.
In the present work, the vortex identification method ${\lambda}_{\rho}$, which
considers the fluid compressibility, is used to study the vortex dynamics in a
cool liquid n-decane transcritical jet surrounded by a hotter oxygen gaseous
stream at supercritical pressures. The relationship between vortical structures
and the liquid surface evolution is detailed, along with the vorticity
generation mechanisms, including variable-density effects. The roles of hairpin
and roller vortices in the early deformation of lobes, the layering and tearing
of liquid sheets, and the formation of fuel-rich gaseous blobs are analysed. At
these high pressures, enhanced intraphase mixing and ambient gas dissolution
affect the local liquid structures (i.e., lobes). Thus, liquid breakup differs
from classical sub-critical atomisation. Near the interface, liquid density and
viscosity drop by up to 10% and 70%, respectively, and the liquid is more
easily affected by the vortical motion (e.g., liquid sheets wrap around
vortices). Despite the variable density, compressible vorticity generation

solution to traffic forecasting. While successful, they rely on the message
passing scheme of GNNs to establish spatial dependencies between nodes, and
thus inevitably inherit GNNs' notorious inefficiency. Given these facts, in
this paper, we propose an embarrassingly simple yet remarkably effective
spatio-temporal learning approach, entitled SimST. Specifically, SimST
approximates the efficacies of GNNs by two spatial learning techniques, which
respectively model local and global spatial correlations. Moreover, SimST can
be used alongside various temporal models and involves a tailored training
strategy. We conduct experiments on five traffic benchmarks to assess the
capability of SimST in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. Empirical results
show that SimST improves the prediction throughput by up to 39 times compared
to more sophisticated STGNNs while attaining comparable performance, which
indicates that GNNs are not the only option for spatial modeling in traffic
forecasting.

hierarchical cluster analysis on 366 municipalities and other minor entities

similarities between territorial entities when designing national public
policies of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) based on evidence. Methods and
results: Consider data from various sources to characterize the population of
Venezuela through their territorial entities. Select variables at the level of
the territorial entities to cover demographic characteristics, mortality and
nutrition, coverage of reliable water and sanitation services, access to
education, and access to information and communication technologies. Classify
the territorial entities into a limited number of mutually exclusive groups
using hierarchical clustering techniques and based on proximity in the
multi-dimensional space. Adjust of assignments, reallocating some entities into
a different group based on the specialists' opinion about its hierarchy in the
cities regional system and its geographic location. Define an indicator to
verify the consistency of the groups built. Conduct a statistical analysis to
confirm separation of the groups. Demonstrate the utility of the results with
some examples of common analysis when building a sanitary public policy, using
seven distinct groups of recommendations depending on each cluster.
Conclusions: Cluster analysis can be a useful method to analyse relevant
differences between territorial entities when designing national public
policies based on evidence.

communication all over the world. One major challenge in cellular networks is a
dynamic change in the number of users and their usage of telecommunication
service which results in overloading at certain base stations. One class of
solution to deal with this overloading issue is the deployment of drones that
can act as temporary base stations and offload the traffic from the overloaded
base station. There are two main challenges in the development of this
solution. Firstly, the drone is expected to be present around the base station
where an overload would occur in the future thus requiring a prediction of
traffic overload. Secondly, drones are highly constrained in their resources
and can only fly for a few minutes. If the affected base station is really far,
drones can never reach there. This requires the initial placement of drones in
sectors where overloading can occur thus again requiring a traffic forecast but
at a different spatial scale. It must be noted that the spatial extent of the
region that the problem poses and the extremely limited power resources
available to the drone pose a great challenge that is hard to overcome without
deploying the drones in strategic positions to reduce the time to fly to the
required high-demand zone. Moreover, since drone fly at a finite speed, it is
important that a predictive solution that can forecast traffic surges is
adopted so that drones are available to offload the overload before it actually
happens. Both these goals require analysis and forecast of cellular network
traffic which is the main goal of this project

personalized spatial audio by reconstructing 3D human ears with single-view

AudioEar3D, a high-quality 3D ear dataset consisting of 112 point cloud ear
scans with RGB images. To self-supervisedly train a reconstruction model, we
further collect a 2D ear dataset composed of 2,000 images, each one with manual
annotation of occlusion and 55 landmarks, named AudioEar2D. To our knowledge,
both datasets have the largest scale and best quality of their kinds for public
use. Further, we propose AudioEarM, a reconstruction method guided by a depth
estimation network that is trained on synthetic data, with two loss functions
tailored for ear data. Lastly, to fill the gap between the vision and acoustics

an off-the-shelf 3D human body and simulate a personalized Head-Related

converge in the $L^p$ metric ($p\geq 1$) to a spherical decreasing mean width
rearrangement. A sharp extended Urysohn's type inequality for quasiconcave

  Using inner linearizations from convex optimization, an analogue of polytopes
inscribed in a convex body is studied for log concave functions: Given a log
concave function, we consider log-affine minorants defined in terms of the
inner linearizations of the corresponding convex base function. As an
application of the functional Minkowski symmetrizations, it is shown that any
functional defined on the class of log concave functions which satisfies
certain conditions is maximized by the reflectional hypo-symmetrization. As a
corollary, it is shown that among all log concave functions of a given mean
width, the reflectional hypo-symmetrization is hardest to approximate by
``log-affine"" minorants with a fixed number of break points. This result
generalizes the classical fact which states that among all convex bodies of a
given mean width, a Euclidean ball is hardest to approximate by inscribed
polytopes with a fixed number of vertices.
  Finally, the Blaschke symmetral of a function is defined in a natural way,
and some of its basic properties are proved. It is shown that under suitable
assumptions, every quasiconcave function can be transformed into its symmetric
decreasing surface area rearrangement by a sequence of Blaschke
symmetrizations. Some applications of this result are also presented.

quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) bismuth halide, Bi$_{4}$I$_{1.2}$Br$_{2.8}$

BIB hosts TSS on the (100)$\prime$ side surface in the form of two anisotropic
$\pi$-offset Dirac cones (DCs) separated in momentum while topologically dark
on the (001) top surface. The ARPES data fully determine a unique side-surface
Hamiltonian and thereby identify two pairs of non-degenerate helical saddle
points and a series of four Lifshitz transitions. The fact that both the
surface Dirac and saddle points are in the global bulk band gap of 195 meV,
combined with the small Dirac velocities, nontrivial spin texture, and the
near-gap chemical potential, qualifies BIB to be not only an ideal WTI but also
a fertile ground for topological many-body physics.

information from a given se-quence. Although various SPM methods have been
investigated, most of these focus on mining all of the patterns. However, users
sometimes want to mine patterns with the same specific prefix pattern, called
co-occurrence pattern. Since sequential rule mining can make better use of the
results of SPM, and obtain better recommendation performance, this paper
addresses the issue of maximal co-occurrence nonoverlapping sequential rule
(MCoR) mining and proposes the MCoR-Miner algo-rithm. To improve the efficiency
of support calculation, MCoR-Miner employs depth-first search and backtracking
strategies equipped with an indexing mechanism to avoid the use of sequential
searching. To obviate useless support calculations for some sequences,
MCoR-Miner adopts a filtering strategy to prune the sequences without the
prefix pattern. To reduce the number of candidate patterns, MCoR-Miner applies
the frequent item and binomial enumeration tree strategies. To avoid searching
for the maximal rules through brute force, MCoR-Miner uses a screening
strategy. To validate the per-formance of MCoR-Miner, eleven competitive
algorithms were conducted on eight sequences. Our experimental results showed
that MCoR-Miner outperformed other competitive algorithms, and yielded better

typically conduct such perturbation by utilizing the feature statistics within
a mini-batch, limiting their representation capability. Inspired by the domain
generalization objective, we introduce a novel Adversarial Style Augmentation
(ASA) method, which explores broader style spaces by generating more effective
statistics perturbation via adversarial training. Specifically, we first search
for the most sensitive direction and intensity for statistics perturbation by
maximizing the task loss. By updating the model against the adversarial
statistics perturbation during training, we allow the model to explore the
worst-case domain and hence improve its generalization performance. To
facilitate the application of ASA, we design a simple yet effective module,
namely AdvStyle, which instantiates the ASA method in a plug-and-play manner.
We justify the efficacy of AdvStyle on tasks of cross-domain classification and

products for the following ranking phase. Recently, the paradigm of
pre-training and fine-tuning has shown its potential in incorporating visual
clues into retrieval tasks. In this paper, we focus on solving the problem of
text-to-multimodal retrieval in Taobao Search. We consider that users'
attention on titles or images varies on products. Hence, we propose a novel
Modal Adaptation module for cross-modal fusion, which helps assigns appropriate
weights on texts and images across products. Furthermore, in e-commerce search,
user queries tend to be brief and thus lead to significant semantic imbalance
between user queries and product titles. Therefore, we design a separate text
encoder and a Keyword Enhancement mechanism to enrich the query representations
and improve text-to-multimodal matching. To this end, we present a novel
vision-language (V+L) pre-training methods to exploit the multimodal
information of (user query, product title, product image). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our retrieval-specific pre-training model

Incorporating propagation-based phase contrast can vastly improve data quality
for weakly attenuating samples via material-specific phase retrieval filters,
allowing radiation exposure to be reduced. However, applying phase retrieval to
multi-material phantoms complicates analysis by requiring a choice of which
material boundary to tune the phase retrieval. Filtering for the boundary with
strongest phase contrast increases noise suppression, but with the detriment of
over-blurring other interfaces, potentially obscuring small or neighbouring
features and removing quantitative sample information. Additionally, regions
bounded by more than one material type inherently cannot be conventionally
filtered to reconstruct the whole boundary. As remedy, we present a
computationally-efficient, non-iterative nor AI-mediated method for applying
strong phase retrieval, whilst preserving sharp boundaries for all materials

the Universe, directly measuring the effects of gravity on the largest scales
and thereby providing a test for theories of gravity. Complete peculiar
velocity datasets comprise both galaxy redshifts and redshift-independent
distance measures, estimated by methods such as the Tully-Fisher relation.
Traditionally, the Tully-Fisher relation is first calibrated using distance
indicators such as Cepheid variables in a small sample of galaxies; the
calibrated relation is then used to determine peculiar velocities. In this
analysis, we employ a one-step Bayesian method to simultaneously determine the
parameters of the Tully-Fisher relation and the peculiar velocity field. We
have also generalised the Tully-Fisher relation by allowing for a curvature at
the bright end. We design a mock survey to emulate the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4)
peculiar velocity dataset. We then apply our method to the CF4 data to obtain
new constraints for the growth rate of structure parameter
($\beta=0.40\pm0.07$), the residual bulk flow ($\mathbf{V}_{\textrm{ext}}
=$[69$\pm$15,$-$158$\pm$9,14$\pm$7]\,km$~s^{-1}$ in Supergalactic coordinates),
and the parameters for a Tully-Fisher relation with curvature. We obtain an
estimate for the product of the growth rate and mass fluctuation amplitude
$f\sigma_{8}=0.40\pm0.07$. We combine this measurement of $f\sigma_{8}$ with
those of other galaxy redshift surveys to fit the growth index $\gamma$.
Assuming cosmological parameters from the latest Planck CMB results, we find
that $\gamma>6/11$ is favoured. We plan to use this improved method for
recovering peculiar velocities on the large new samples of Tully-Fisher data
from surveys such as WALLABY, resulting in more precise growth rate
measurements at low redshifts.

  We propose a novel fairness notion of average envy-freeness (AEF), where the
envy of agents is defined on the average value of items in the bundles. Average
envy-freeness provides a reasonable comparison between agents based on the
items they receive and reflects their entitlements. We study the complexity of
finding AEF and its relaxation, average envy-freeness up to one item (AEF-1).
While deciding if an AEF allocation exists is NP-complete, an AEF-1 allocation
is guaranteed to exist and can be computed in polynomial time. We also study
allocation with quotas, i.e. restrictions on the sizes of bundles. We prove
that finding AEF-1 allocation satisfying a quota is NP-hard. Nevertheless, in
the instances with a fixed number of agents, we propose polynomial-time
algorithms to find AEF-1 allocation with a quota for binary valuation and
approximated AEF-1 allocation with a quota for general valuation.

lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide had shown 6.3-dB squeezing at a 6-THz
frequency. First, to improve efficiency of the squeezed light detection, we
reduced effective optical loss to about 12% by removing extra optics and
changing the detection method into a low-loss balanced homodyne measurement.
Second, to minimize phase-locking fluctuation, we constructed a
frequency-optimized phase-locking system by comprehending its frequency
responses. Lastly, we found optimal experimental parameters of a measurement
frequency and a pump power from their dependences for the squeezing levels. The
measurement frequency was decided as 11 MHz to maximize a clearance between
shot and circuit noises. Furthermore, pump power was optimized as 660 mW to get
higher squeezing level while suppressing anti-squeezed-noise contamination due
to an imperfection of phase locking. To our knowledge, this is the first
achievement of over-8-dB squeezing by waveguide OPAs without any
loss-correction and circuit-noise correction. Moreover, it is shown that the
squeezing level soon after our PPLN waveguide is estimated at over 10 dB, which
is thought to be mainly restricted by the waveguide loss. This broadband
highly-squeezed light opens the possibility to realize fault-tolerant

lack of real conversational search data, they have to use artificial datasets
for training, which limits their generalizability to real-world search
scenarios. As a result, the industry has shown reluctance to implement them in
reality, further suspending the availability of real conversational search
interaction data. The above dilemma can be formulated as a cold start problem
of clarifying question generation and conversational search in general.
Furthermore, even if we do have large-scale conversational logs, it is not
realistic to gather training data that can comprehensively cover all possible

equations (PDEs). A burgeoning paradigm is learning neural operators to
approximate the input-output mappings of PDEs. While previous deep models have
explored the multiscale architectures and various operator designs, they are
limited to learning the operators as a whole in the coordinate space. In real
physical science problems, PDEs are complex coupled equations with numerical
solvers relying on discretization into high-dimensional coordinate space, which
cannot be precisely approximated by a single operator nor efficiently learned
due to the curse of dimensionality. We present Latent Spectral Models (LSM)
toward an efficient and precise solver for high-dimensional PDEs. Going beyond
the coordinate space, LSM enables an attention-based hierarchical projection
network to reduce the high-dimensional data into a compact latent space in
linear time. Inspired by classical spectral methods in numerical analysis, we
design a neural spectral block to solve PDEs in the latent space that
approximates complex input-output mappings via learning multiple basis
operators, enjoying nice theoretical guarantees for convergence and
approximation. Experimentally, LSM achieves consistent state-of-the-art and
yields a relative gain of 11.5% averaged on seven benchmarks covering both
solid and fluid physics. Code is available at

principle of {\it entropic similarity}, defined by ratios of (i) entropy
production terms; (ii) entropy flow rates or fluxes; or (iii) information flow
rates or fluxes. Since all processes involving work against friction,
dissipation, diffusion, dispersion, mixing, separation, chemical reaction, gain
of information or other irreversible changes are driven by (or must overcome)
the second law of thermodynamics, it is appropriate to analyse these processes
directly in terms of competing entropy-producing and transporting phenomena and
the dominant entropic regime, rather than indirectly in terms of forces. In
this study, we derive entropic groups for a wide variety of phenomena relevant
to fluid mechanics, classified into diffusion and chemical reaction processes,
dispersion mechanisms and wave phenomena. It is shown that many dimensionless
groups traditionally derived by kinematic or dynamic similarity (including the
Reynolds number) can also be recovered by entropic similarity -- albeit with a
different entropic interpretation -- while a large number of new dimensionless
groups are also identified. The analyses significantly expand the scope of
dimensional analysis and similarity arguments for the resolution of new and
existing problems in science and engineering.

in large-eddy simulations (LESs) of turbulent shear flows using a coarse grid
resolution. We decompose the SGS stress into two parts to observe the role of
SGS stress in turbulent shear flows in addition to the energy transfer between
grid-scale (GS or resolved scale) and SGS. One is the isotropic eddy-viscosity
term, which contributes to energy transfer, and the other is the residual
anisotropic term, which is separated from the energy transfer. We investigate
the budget equation for GS Reynolds stress in turbulent channel flows
accompanied by the SGS stress decomposition. In addition, we examine the medium
and coarse filter length cases; the conventional eddy-viscosity models can
fairly predict the mean velocity profile for the medium filter case and fails
for the coarse filter case. The budget for GS turbulent kinetic energy shows
that the anisotropic SGS stress has a negligible contribution to energy
transfer. In contrast, the anisotropic stress has a large and non-dissipative
contribution to the streamwise and spanwise components of GS Reynolds stress
when the filter size is large. Even for the medium-size filter case, the
anisotropic stress contributes positively to the budget for the spanwise GS
Reynolds stress. Spectral analysis of the budget reveals that the positive
contribution is prominent at a scale consistent with the spacing of streaks in
the near-wall region. Therefore, we infer that anisotropic stress contributes
to the generation mechanism of coherent structures. Predicting the positive
contribution of the anisotropic stress to the budget is key to further
improving SGS models.

are common in health behaviors research. There is a lack of empirical data
about the relative performance of prevailing statistical models when outcomes
are zero-inflated, particularly compared with recently developed approaches.
  Methods: The current simulation study examined five commonly used analytical
approaches for count outcomes, including two linear models (with outcomes on
raw and log-transformed scales, respectively) and three count
distribution-based models (i.e., Poisson, negative binomial, and zero-inflated
Poisson (ZIP) models). We also considered the marginalized zero-inflated
Poisson (MZIP) model, a novel alternative that estimates the effects on overall
mean while adjusting for zero-inflation. Extensive simulations were conducted
to evaluate their the statistical power and Type I error rate across various
data conditions.
  Results: Under zero-inflation, the Poisson model failed to control the Type I
error rate, resulting in higher than expected false positive results. When the
intervention effects on the zero (vs. non-zero) and count parts were in the
same direction, the MZIP model had the highest statistical power, followed by
the linear model with outcomes on raw scale, negative binomial model, and ZIP
model. The performance of a linear model with a log-transformed outcome
variable was unsatisfactory. When only one of the effects on the zero (vs.
non-zero) part and the count part existed, the ZIP model had the highest
statistical power.
  Conclusions: The MZIP model demonstrated better statistical properties in
detecting true intervention effects and controlling false positive results for
zero-inflated count outcomes. This MZIP model may serve as an appealing
analytical approach to evaluating overall intervention effects in studies with
count outcomes marked by excessive zeros.

an optimization problem with only linear equality and box constraints by
introducing slack variables. Secondly, we use the idea of ADMM to decompose the
quadratic programming (QP) subproblem. Especially, the QP subproblem
corresponding to the introducing slack variable is simple, and it has an
explicit optimal solution without increasing computational cost. Thirdly, the
search direction is generated by the optimal solutions of the subproblems, and
the new iteration point is yielded by Armijo line search with augmented
Lagrange function. And the global convergence of the algorithm is analyzed
under weaker assumptions. In addition, box constraints are extended to general
nonempty closed convex sets, moreover, the global convergence of the
corresponding algorithm is also proved. Finally, some preliminary numerical
experiments and applications in the mid-to-large-scale economic dispatch
problems for power systems are reported, and these show that our proposed

this paper, to analyze high-order statistics of SINR and characterize the
disparity among individual links, we provide a meta distribution (MD)-based
analytical framework for UAV-assisted cellular networks, in which the
probabilistic line-of-sight channel and realistic antenna pattern are taken
into account for air-to-ground transmissions. To accurately characterize the
interference from UAVs, we relax the widely applied uniform off-boresight angle
(OBA) assumption and derive the exact distribution of OBA. Using stochastic
geometry, for both steerable and vertical antenna scenarios, we obtain
mathematical expressions for the moments of condition success probability, the
SINR MD, and the mean local delay. Moreover, we study the asymptotic behavior
of the moments as network density approaches infinity. Numerical results
validate the tightness of the theoretical results and show that the uniform OBA
assumption underestimates the network performance, especially in the regime of
moderate altitude of UAV. We also show that when UAVs are equipped with
steerable antennas, the network coverage and user fairness can be optimized

  Robustness","Accepted to AAAI 2023 conference",,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  We present a new algorithm to train a robust malware detector. Modern malware
detectors rely on machine learning algorithms. Now, the adversarial objective
is to devise alterations to the malware code to decrease the chance of being
detected whilst preserving the functionality and realism of the malware.
Adversarial learning is effective in improving robustness but generating
functional and realistic adversarial malware samples is non-trivial. Because:
i) in contrast to tasks capable of using gradient-based feedback, adversarial
learning in a domain without a differentiable mapping function from the problem
space (malware code inputs) to the feature space is hard; and ii) it is
difficult to ensure the adversarial malware is realistic and functional. This
presents a challenge for developing scalable adversarial machine learning
algorithms for large datasets at a production or commercial scale to realize
robust malware detectors. We propose an alternative; perform adversarial
learning in the feature space in contrast to the problem space. We prove the
projection of perturbed, yet valid malware, in the problem space into feature
space will always be a subset of adversarials generated in the feature space.
Hence, by generating a robust network against feature-space adversarial
examples, we inherently achieve robustness against problem-space adversarial
examples. We formulate a Bayesian adversarial learning objective that captures
the distribution of models for improved robustness. We prove that our learning
method bounds the difference between the adversarial risk and empirical risk
explaining the improved robustness. We show that adversarially trained BNNs
achieve state-of-the-art robustness. Notably, adversarially trained BNNs are
robust against stronger attacks with larger attack budgets by a margin of up to
15% on a recent production-scale malware dataset of more than 20 million

  arXiv:2203.16803",,,,"math.OC cs.CR cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This note addresses the problem of evaluating the impact of an attack on
discrete-time nonlinear stochastic control systems. The problem is formulated
as an optimal control problem with a joint chance constraint that forces the
adversary to avoid detection throughout a given time period. Due to the joint
constraint, the optimal control policy depends not only on the current state,
but also on the entire history, leading to an explosion of the search space and
making the problem generally intractable. However, we discover that the current
state and whether an alarm has been triggered, or not, is sufficient for
specifying the optimal decision at each time step. This information, which we
refer to as the alarm flag, can be added to the state space to create an
equivalent optimal control problem that can be solved with existing numerical
approaches using a Markov policy. Additionally, we note that the formulation
results in a policy that does not avoid detection once an alarm has been
triggered. We extend the formulation to handle multi-alarm avoidance policies
for more reasonable attack impact evaluations, and show that the idea of
augmenting the state space with an alarm flag is valid in this extended
formulation as well.

which induce reductions in computation/communication speeds. A common strategy
for mitigating such stragglers is to incorporate Reed-Solomon based MDS

resilience against an optimal number of stragglers. However, these codes assign
dense linear combinations of submatrices to the worker nodes. When the input
matrices are sparse, these approaches increase the number of non-zero entries
in the encoded matrices, which in turn adversely affects the worker computation

the assigned encoded submatrices are random linear combinations of a small
number of submatrices. In addition to being well suited for sparse input
matrices, our approach continues have the optimal straggler resilience in a
certain range of problem parameters. Moreover, compared to recent sparse matrix
computation approaches, the search for a ``good'' set of random coefficients to
promote numerical stability in our method is much more computationally
efficient. We show that our approach can efficiently utilize partial
computations done by slower worker nodes in a heterogeneous system which can
enhance the overall computation speed. Numerical experiments conducted through
Amazon Web Services (AWS) demonstrate up to 30% reduction in per worker node

posing potential attack subjects. Therefore, analyzing contract binaries is
vital since their sources are unavailable, involving identification comprising
function entry identification and detecting its boundaries. Such boundaries are
critical to many smart contract applications, e.g. reverse engineering and
profiling. Unfortunately, it is challenging to identify functions from these
stripped contract binaries due to the lack of internal function call statements
and the compiler-inducing instruction reshuffling. Recently, several existing
works excessively relied on a set of handcrafted heuristic rules which impose
several faults. To address this issue, we propose a novel neural network-based
framework for EVM bytecode Function Entries and Boundaries Identification
(neural-FEBI) that does not rely on a fixed set of handcrafted rules. Instead,
it used a two-level bi-Long Short-Term Memory network and a Conditional Random
Field network to locate the function entries. The suggested framework also
devises a control flow traversal algorithm to determine the code segments
reachable from the function entry as its boundary. Several experiments on
38,996 publicly available smart contracts collected as binary demonstrate that
neural-FEBI confirms the lowest and highest F1-scores for the function entries
identification task across different datasets of 88.3 to 99.7, respectively.
Its performance on the function boundary identification task is also increased
from 79.4% to 97.1% compared with state-of-the-art. We further demonstrate that
the identified function information can be used to construct more accurate
intra-procedural CFGs and call graphs. The experimental results confirm that
the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art, often based
on handcrafted heuristic rules.

long-term analyses of the dynamics of the seed bank and the ensuing vegetation
are rare. Here, we studied the dynamics in plant communities with high
dominance of annuals in Mediterranean, semiarid, and arid ecosystems for nine
consecutive years. For annuals, we hypothesized that the density of the seed
bank would be more stable than the density of the standing herbaceous
vegetation. Moreover, we predicted that differences in temporal variability
between the seed bank and the vegetation would increase with aridity, where
year-to-year rainfall variability is higher. We found that the temporal
variability at the population level (assessed as the standard deviation of the
loge-transformed density) of the nine dominant annuals in each site did not
differ between the seed bank and the ensuing vegetation in any of the sites.
For the total density of annuals, patterns depended on aridity. In the
Mediterranean site, the temporal variability was similar in the seed bank and
the vegetation (0.40 vs. 0.40). Still, in the semiarid and arid sites,
variability in the seed bank was lower than in the vegetation (0.49 vs. 1.01
and 0.63 vs. 1.38, respectively). This difference between the population-level
patterns and the total density of annuals can be related to the lower
population synchrony in their seed bank. In contrast, for the herbaceous
perennials (all species combined), the seed bank variability was higher than in
the vegetation. Overall, our results highlight the role of the seed bank in
buffering the annual vegetation density with increasing climatic uncertainty
typical in aridity gradients. This role is crucial under the increasing
uncertainty imposed by climatic change in the region.

enhancing magnetic emission has not been explored. Here, we study the
simultaneous magnetic and electric Purcell enhancement supported by a hybrid
structure consisting of a dielectric nanoring and a silver nanorod Such a
structure enables low Ohmic loss and highly-confined field under the mode
hybridization of magnetic resonances on nanoring and electric resonances on
nanorod in the optical communication band. So, the 60-fold magnetic Purcell
enhancement and 45-fold electric Purcell enhancement can be achieved
simultaneously with $>95\%$ of the radiation transmitted to far field. The
position of emitter has a several-ten-nanometer tolerance for sufficiently
large Purcell enhancement, which brings convenience to experimental
fabrications. Moreover, an array formed by this hybrid nanostructure can
further enhance the magnetic Purcell factors. The findings provide a
possibility to selectively excite the magnetic and electric emission in
integrated photon circuits. It may also facilitate brighter magnetic emission
sources and light-emitting metasurfaces in a simpler arrangement.

Multipole Method (from now on abbreviated as AIFMM), for linear systems arising
out of $N$-body problems. AIFMM relies on the following three main ideas: (i)
Certain sub-blocks in the matrix corresponding to $N$-body problems can be
efficiently represented as low-rank matrices; (ii) The low-rank sub-blocks in
the above matrix are leveraged to construct an extended sparse linear system;
(iii) While solving the extended sparse linear system, certain fill-ins that
arise in the elimination phase are represented as low-rank matrices and are
""redirected"" though other variables maintaining zero fill-in sparsity. The main
highlights of this article are the following: (i) Our method is completely
algebraic (as opposed to the existing Inverse Fast Multipole Method~\cite{
arXiv:1407.1572,doi:10.1137/15M1034477,TAKAHASHI2017406}, from now on

Approximation~\cite{arXiv:2203.14832} (from now on abbreviated as NNCA) to
represent the matrix arising out of $N$-body problems. (ii) A significant
contribution is that the algorithm presented in this article is more efficient
than the existing IFMMs. In the existing IFMMs, the fill-ins are compressed and
redirected as and when they are created. Whereas in this article, we update the
fill-ins first without affecting the computational complexity. We then compress
and redirect them only once. (iii) Another noteworthy contribution of this
article is that we provide a comparison of AIFMM with Hierarchical Off-Diagonal
Low-Rank (from now on abbreviated as HODLR) based fast direct solver and NNCA
powered GMRES based fast iterative solver. (iv) Additionally, AIFMM is also
demonstrated as a preconditioner.

us to investigate the relation between solvent quality -- the capacity of a

repeated folding and unfolding events and with polar polypeptides presenting a

All considered polypeptides are also found to have a favorable solvation free

  In this work, we present a novel _Generalised Linear Mixed Model Neural

learning framework, offering the predictive power of neural networks and the
transparency of random effects estimates, the latter of which cannot be

Notably, we find that the GLMMNet often outperforms or at least performs
comparably with an entity embedded neural network, while providing the
additional benefit of transparency, which is particularly valuable in practical

  Importantly, while our model was motivated by actuarial applications, it can
have wider applicability. The GLMMNet would suit any applications that involve

process is an enormous challenge. There are broadly two different aspects of
the problem that affect the route taken. First is obviously the couplings
between the various sites, which translates into the intrinsic ""strength"" of a
state-to-state channel. Apart from the inter-state couplings, the solvents
affecting the energies of the state, and their relative coupling strengths and
time-scales form the second factor. This impact of dissipative media is
significantly more difficult to analyze. Building on recently derived relations
between coherences and population derivatives, we present an analysis of the
transport that allows us to account for both the effects in a rigorous manner.
We demonstrate the richness hidden behind the transport even for a relatively
simple system, a 4-site coarse-grained model of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson
complex. The effect of the local dissipative media is highly non-trivial. We
show that while the impact on the total site population may be small, there are
dramatic changes to the pathway taken by the transport process. The ability to
untangle the dynamics at a greater granularity opens up possibilities in terms
of design of novel systems with an eye towards quantum control.

optimization in a distributed network with workers connected to a master node.
More specifically, we consider a structured stochastic weakly convex objective
function which is the composition of a convex function and a smooth nonconvex
function. Recently, Xu et al. 2022 showed that an inertial stochastic
subgradient method converges at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\tau/\sqrt{K})$, which
suffers a significant penalty from the maximum information delay $\tau$. To
alleviate this issue, we propose a new delayed stochastic prox-linear
($\texttt{DSPL}$) method in which the master performs the proximal update of
the parameters and the workers only need to linearly approximate the inner
smooth function. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that the delays only affect the
high order term in the complexity rate and hence, are negligible after a
certain number of $\texttt{DSPL}$ iterations. Moreover, to further improve the
empirical performance, we propose a delayed extrapolated prox-linear
($\texttt{DSEPL}$) method which employs Polyak-type momentum to speed up the
algorithm convergence. Building on the tools for analyzing $\texttt{DSPL}$, we
also develop improved analysis of delayed stochastic subgradient method
($\texttt{DSGD}$). In particular, for general weakly convex problems, we show
that convergence of $\texttt{DSGD}$ only depends on the expected delay.

We find that: (1) no existing method behaves well in both settings; (2)
fine-tuning PLMs on in-distribution data benefits detecting semantic shifts but
severely deteriorates detecting non-semantic shifts, which can be attributed to
the distortion of task-agnostic features. To alleviate the issue, we present a
simple yet effective general OOD score named GNOME that integrates the
confidence scores derived from the task-agnostic and task-specific

  length and precision",,,,,"cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Verification of discrete time or continuous time dynamical systems over the
reals is known to be undecidable. It is however known that undecidability does
not hold for various classes of systems: if robustness is defined as the fact
that reachability relation is stable under infinitesimal perturbation, then
their reachability relation is decidable. In other words, undecidability
implies sensitivity under infinitesimal perturbation, a property usually not
expected in systems considered in practice, and hence can be seen (somehow
informally) as an artefact of the theory, that always assumes exactness. In a
similar vein, it is known that, while undecidability holds for logical formulas
over the reals, it does not hold when considering delta-undecidability: one
must determine whether a property is true, or $\delta$-far from being true. We
first extend the previous statements to a theory for general (discrete time,
continuous-time, and even hybrid) dynamical systems, and we relate the two
approaches. We also relate robustness to some geometric properties of
reachability relation. But mainly, when a system is robust, it then makes sense
to quantify at which level of perturbation. We prove that assuming robustness
to polynomial perturbations on precision leads to reachability verifiable in
complexity class PSPACE, and even to a characterization of this complexity
class. We prove that assuming robustness to polynomial perturbations on time or
length of trajectories leads to similar statements, but with PTIME. It has been
recently unexpectedly shown that the length of a solution of a polynomial
ordinary differential equation corresponds to a time of computation: PTIME
corresponds to solutions of polynomial differential equations of polynomial
length. Our results argue that the answer is given by precision: space
corresponds to the involved precision.

receiving mental health counseling in the digital healthcare space. An
assistive counseling conversation commences with natural open-ended topics to
familiarize the client with the environment and later converges into more
fine-grained domain-specific topics. Unlike other conversational systems, which
are categorized as open-domain or task-oriented systems, VMHAs possess a hybrid
conversational flow. These counseling bots need to comprehend various aspects
of the conversation, such as dialogue-acts, intents, etc., to engage the client
in an effective conversation. Although the surge in digital health research
highlights applications of many general-purpose response generation systems,
they are barely suitable in the mental health domain -- the prime reason is the
lack of understanding in mental health counseling. Moreover, in general,
dialogue-act guided response generators are either limited to a template-based
paradigm or lack appropriate semantics. To this end, we propose READER -- a
REsponse-Act guided reinforced Dialogue genERation model for the mental health
counseling conversations. READER is built on transformer to jointly predict a
potential dialogue-act d(t+1) for the next utterance (aka response-act) and to
generate an appropriate response u(t+1). Through the
transformer-reinforcement-learning (TRL) with Proximal Policy Optimization

semantic richness of the responses via BERTScore in our reward computation. We
evaluate READER on HOPE, a benchmark counseling conversation dataset and

general covariance and simple random coordinate transformations. Our approach
relies on the fact that physical laws are independent of the coordinate choice,
so the change in the coordinate system preserves the type of a parametric PDE

the bottleneck for deploying AVs. An AV should be sufficiently tested under
different highway interchanges, which is still challenging due to the lack of
available datasets containing diverse highway interchanges. In this paper, we
propose a model-driven method, FLYOVER, to generate a dataset consisting of
diverse interchanges with measurable diversity coverage. First, FLYOVER
proposes a labeled digraph to model the topology of an interchange. Second,
FLYOVER takes real-world interchanges as input to guarantee topology
practicality and extracts different topology equivalence classes by classifying
the corresponding topology models. Third, for each topology class, FLYOVER
identifies the corresponding geometrical features for the ramps and generates
concrete interchanges using k-way combinatorial coverage and differential
evolution. To illustrate the diversity and applicability of the generated
interchange dataset, we test the built-in traffic flow control algorithm in
SUMO and the fuel-optimization trajectory tracking algorithm deployed to
Alibaba's autonomous trucks on the dataset. The results show that except for
the geometrical difference, the interchanges are diverse in throughput and fuel
consumption under the traffic flow control and trajectory tracking algorithms,

migration in Mexico during 2005-2020. Unlike earlier studies, we use network
analysis to quantify changes in the degree of interconnectedness among all
municipalities in Mexico and with the US, breaking it down by
origin-destination pairs. To identify the impact of violence on the changes of
the migration network, we use instrumental variables. We exploit the exogenous
variation in heroin street prices in the US, local prices of corn in Mexico,
and differences in which regions received more Chinese immigrant communities
during the 1930s, members of which introduced opium cultivation and drug
smuggling networks in Mexico. These instruments help us identify the areas with
a current presence of drug trafficking organizations and facing increases in
violence. We show that municipalities that experience rises in homicide rates
continue to attract immigrants within the country, but they face a larger rise
in domestic emigration. The violence also discourages the return migration of
Mexicans from the US and non-transit international emigration. Consistent with
our findings, areas affected by violence also experience a long-term reduction
in vehicle trips made in the highway network connecting them with the rest of
the country.

processing. However, it is still not well-solved to gain discriminative and
transferable features of point clouds for efficient training on downstream
tasks, due to their natural sparsity and irregularity. We propose PointSmile, a
reconstruction-free self-supervised learning paradigm by maximizing curriculum
mutual information (CMI) across the replicas of point cloud objects. From the
perspective of how-and-what-to-learn, PointSmile is designed to imitate human
curriculum learning, i.e., starting with an easy curriculum and gradually
increasing the difficulty of that curriculum. To solve ""how-to-learn"", we
introduce curriculum data augmentation (CDA) of point clouds. CDA encourages
PointSmile to learn from easy samples to hard ones, such that the latent space
can be dynamically affected to create better embeddings. To solve
""what-to-learn"", we propose to maximize both feature- and class-wise CMI, for
better extracting discriminative features of point clouds. Unlike most of
existing methods, PointSmile does not require a pretext task, nor does it
require cross-modal data to yield rich latent representations. We demonstrate
the effectiveness and robustness of PointSmile in downstream tasks including
object classification and segmentation. Extensive results show that our
PointSmile outperforms existing self-supervised methods, and compares favorably
with popular fully-supervised methods on various standard architectures.

quantitatively described with formation of the certain type of nanostructured

The randomized Kaczmarz (RK) method has received a lot of attention because of
its computational efficiency and low memory footprint. A recently proposed
approach is the matrix equation relaxed greedy RK (ME-RGRK) method, which
greedily uses the loss of the index pair as a threshold to detect and avoid
projecting the working rows onto that are too far from the current iterate. In
this work, we utilize the Polyak's and Nesterov's momentums to further speed up
the convergence rate of the ME-RGRK method. The resulting methods are shown to
converge linearly to a least-squares solution with minimum Frobenius norm.
Finally, some numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the feasibility
and effectiveness of our proposed methods. In addition, a real-world
application, i.e., tensor product surface fitting in computer-aided geometry
design, has also been presented for explanatory purpose.

Intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques are usually employed, however
they need large quantity of data which is often not feasible in IoT scenarios.
Digital Twins (DTs) have recently emerged as an effective way to replicate
physical entities in the digital domain, to allow for simulation and testing of
models and services. In this paper, we present a novel architecture based on
the emerging Web of Things (WoT) standard, which provides a DT of a smart
environment and applies Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques on real
time data. We implement our system in a real deployment, and test it along with
a legacy system. Our findings show that the benefits of having a digital twin,
specifically for DRL models, allow for faster convergence and finer tuning.

its dynamics, as neutrons can flow relative to the non-superfluid (normal)

comes from pulsar glitches, sudden jumps in the observed rotational period of
radio pulsars. Most models of glitches build on the idea that a superfluid

and its sudden recoupling leads to a glitch. This transition in the strength of
the hydrodynamic coupling is explained in terms of quantum vortices (long-lived

which a star is ripped apart by a supermassive black hole. Observations show
that in a small fraction of TDEs, a short-lived, synchrotron emitting jet is
produced. We observed the newly discovered TDE AT2022cmc with a slew of radio
facilities over the first 100 days after its discovery. The light curve from
the AMI-LA radio interferometer shows day-timescale variability which we
attribute to a high brightness temperature emitting region as opposed to
scintillation. We measure a brightness temperature of 2x10^15 K, which is
unphysical for synchrotron radiation. We suggest that the measured high
brightness temperature is a result of relativistic beaming caused by a jet
being launched at velocities close to the speed of light along our line of
sight. We infer from day-timescale variability that the jet associated with
AT2022cmc has a relativistic Doppler factor of at least 16, which corresponds
to a bulk Lorentz factor of at least 8 if we are observing the jet directly on
axis. Such an inference is the first conclusive evidence that the radio
emission observed from some TDEs is from relativistic jets because it does not
rely on an outflow model. We also compare the first 100 days of radio evolution
of AT2022cmc with that of the previous bright relativistic TDE, Swift J1644,

use the findings to prototype a software aimed at educating consumers in an

useful for IoT device manufacturers seeking to optimally model threats, or
other stakeholders seeking ways to increase information security knowledge

rare-earth elements is a major obstacle for upscaling this emerging
liquefaction technology. In contrast, the higher abundances of the light
rare-earth elements make their alloys highly appealing for magnetocaloric
hydrogen liquefaction. Via a mean-field approach, it is demonstrated that
tuning the Curie temperature ($T_C$) of an idealized light rare-earth-based
magnetocaloric material towards lower cryogenic temperatures leads to larger
maximum magnetic and adiabatic temperature changes ($\Delta S_T$ and $\Delta

tunning $T_C$ of a rare-earth alloy to approach 20 K by mixing light rare-earth

a competitive maximum effect compared to the heavy rare-earth compound

We asymptotically determine the flow around a doubly-periodic array of infinite
slender cylinders, by placing doubly-periodic two-dimensional singularity
solutions within the cylinder and expanding the no-slip condition on the
cylinder's surface in powers of the cylinder radius. The asymptotic solution
provides a closed-form estimate for the flow and forces as a function of the
radius and the dimensions of the cell. The force is compared to results from
lattice-Boltzmann simulations of low-Reynolds-number flows in the same
geometry, and the accuracy of the no-slip condition on the surface of the
cylinder, predicted by the asymptotic theory, is checked. Finally, the
behaviour of the flow, flux, force and effective permeability of the cell is
investigated as a function of the geometric parameters. The structure of the
asymptotic permeability is consistent with other models for the flow parallel
to an array of rods. These models could be used to help understand the flows
within porous systems composed of fibres and systems involving periodic arrays

architecture for learning in deep weight spaces. It takes as input a
concatenation of weights and biases of a pre-trained MLP and processes it using
a composition of layers that are equivariant to the natural permutation
symmetry of the MLP's weights: Changing the order of neurons in intermediate
layers of the MLP does not affect the function it represents. We provide a full
characterization of all affine equivariant and invariant layers for these
symmetries and show how these layers can be implemented using three basic
operations: pooling, broadcasting, and fully connected layers applied to the
input in an appropriate manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
architecture and its advantages over natural baselines in a variety of learning
tasks.

the performance of the CNN model is assessed with the applied computational
homogenization method relating to the accuracy and computational efficiency.

function profile with respect to the separation distance. This description is
incomplete, however, and is insufficient to describe the behavior of more
realistic wavefields that are not simple plane waves. Asymptotic matching to a
prescribed incoming wavefield generically introduces a phasefront curvature
term that changes the characteristic wave behavior from the Airy function to
that of the hyperbolic umbilic function. This function, which is one of the
seven classic 'elementary' functions from catastrophe theory along with the
Airy function, can be understood intuitively as the solution for a linearly
focused Gaussian beam propagating in a linearly varying density profile, as we
show. The morphology of the caustic lines that govern the intensity maxima of
the diffraction pattern as one alters the density lengthscale of the plasma,
the focal length of the incident beam, and also the injection angle of the
incident beam are presented in detail. This morphology includes a
Goos-H\""anchen shift and focal shift at oblique incidence that do not appear in
a reduced ray-based description of the caustic. The enhancement of the
intensity swelling factor for a focused wave compared to the typical Airy
solution is highlighted, and the impact of finite lens aperture is discussed.
Collisional damping and finite beam waist are included in the model and appear
as complex components to the arguments of the hyperbolic umbilic function. The
observations presented here on the behavior of waves near turning points should
aid the development of improved reduced wave models to be used, for example, in
designing modern nuclear fusion experiments.

the gas, while the strength of lines compared to the continuum measures
metallicity. With sufficient spectral resolution, the velocity structure can be

changes of proton density by 12-15%, the surface tension up to 15.7%, which can
be attributed to a non-equilibrium para-/ortho- ratio. Beside these changes, we
also expect a variation of heat capacity. Experiments use a differential
calorimetric approach with two devices: one with an active thermostat for
diathermic measurements, another is fully passive for long-term measurements.
Samples after excitation are degassed at -0.09MPa and thermally equalized in a
water bath. Conducted attempts demonstrated changes in the heat capacity of
experimental samples by 4.17%--5.72% measured in the transient dynamics within
60 min after excitation, which decreases to 2.08% in the steady-state dynamics
90-120 min after excitation. Additionally, we observed occurrence of thermal
fluctuations at the level of 10^-3 C relative temperature on 20-40 min

experimental samples. Obtained results are reproducible in both devices and are
supported by previously published outcomes on four-photon scattering spectra in

combination of gray scale and Near Infrared sensitive camera with passive NIR
illuminator helps to achieve higher accuracy than the existing art. Two novel
techniques have been developed for the detection of iris centre and eye
corners. We propose an index called Form Factor to find the iris position. The
saccadic velocity profile can be estimated from the temporal information of the
iris positions using standard tracking algorithm such as Extended Kalman

approach on graphs crawled starting from dozens of seed entities, and show it
yields high precision graphs (82-92%), while emitting a reasonable number of

  A paradigmatic normal form game can be extended into a Sybil game by having

verify this result using a tensor network algorithm with $U(1)$ symmetry, and
overcome previous challenges due to the large local Hilbert space dimensions in

providing B=582.6827+/-0.00085 MHz and D=3.31+/-0.31 Hz. The nearly exact
coincidence of the rotational and distortion constants in both sources points
unambiguously to a common molecular carrier. Taking into account the chemical
peculiarities of both sources, the carrier could be a radical or an anion. The
radical can be discarded, as the observed lines belong to a singlet species.
Hence, the most plausible carrier is an anion. High-level ab initio
calculations indicate that C7N-, for which we compute a rotational constant of
B=582.0 MHz and a dipole moment of 7.5 D, is the carrier of the lines in both
sources. We predict the neutral C7N to have a ground electronic state 2Pi and a
dipole moment around 1 D. Because of this low dipole moment value and to its
much larger rotational partition function, its lines are expected to be well
below the sensitivity of our data for both sources.

As individual-based models are computationally intensive, it is pivotal to
identify optimal strategies within a reasonable computational budget. Moreover,
due to the high societal impact associated with the implementation of
preventive strategies, uncertainty regarding decisions should be communicated
to policy makers, which is naturally embedded in a Bayesian approach. We
present a novel technique for evaluating vaccine allocation strategies using a
multi-armed bandit framework in combination with a Bayesian anytime $m$-top
exploration algorithm. $m$-top exploration allows the algorithm to learn $m$
policies for which it expects the highest utility, enabling experts to inspect
this small set of alternative strategies, along with their quantified
uncertainty. The anytime component provides policy advisors with flexibility
regarding the computation time and the desired confidence, which is important
as it is difficult to make this trade-off beforehand. We consider the Belgian
COVID-19 epidemic using the individual-based model STRIDE, where we learn a set
of vaccination policies that minimize the number of infections and
hospitalisations. Through experiments we show that our method can efficiently
identify the $m$-top policies, which is validated in a scenario where the
ground truth is available. Finally, we explore how vaccination policies can
best be organised under different contact reduction schemes. Through these
experiments, we show that the top policies follow a clear trend regarding the
prioritised age groups and assigned vaccine type, which provides insights for

emission-line fluxes for physical property measurements. We confirm that 10 out
of the 135 galaxies with [OIII]4363-lines have electron temperatures of
(1.1-2.3)*10^4K, similar to lower-z star-forming galaxies, that can be
explained by heating of young massive stars. We derive metallicities of the 10
galaxies by the direct method and the rest of the galaxies with strong lines by
the metallicity calibrations of Nakajima et al. (2022) applicable for these
low-mass metal-poor galaxies, anchoring the metallicities with the

MZ relation from z~2-3 to z=4-10, while interestingly that the SFR-MZ relation
shows no evolution up to z~8 but a significant decrease at z>8 beyond the

increasing concerns to the public through various malicious applications, such
as financial fraud and privacy leakage. Therefore, safeguarding face
recognition systems against FPA is of utmost importance. Although existing
learning-based face anti-spoofing (FAS) models can achieve outstanding
detection performance, they lack generalization capability and suffer
significant performance drops in unforeseen environments. Many methodologies
seek to use auxiliary modality data (e.g., depth and infrared maps) during the
presentation attack detection (PAD) to address this limitation. However, these
methods can be limited since (1) they require specific sensors such as depth
and infrared cameras for data capture, which are rarely available on commodity
mobile devices, and (2) they cannot work properly in practical scenarios when
either modality is missing or of poor quality. In this paper, we devise an
accurate and robust MultiModal Mobile Face Anti-Spoofing system named M3FAS to
overcome the issues above. The innovation of this work mainly lies in the
following aspects: (1) To achieve robust PAD, our system combines visual and
auditory modalities using three pervasively available sensors: camera, speaker,
and microphone; (2) We design a novel two-branch neural network with three
hierarchical feature aggregation modules to perform cross-modal feature fusion;
(3). We propose a multi-head training strategy. The model outputs three
predictions from the vision, acoustic, and fusion heads, enabling a more
flexible PAD. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the accuracy, robustness,

mathematical descriptions of dynamic systems from input-output data and can
thus benefit from the advances of deep neural networks to enrich the possible
range of models to choose from. For this reason, we provide a survey of deep
learning from a system identification perspective. We cover a wide spectrum of
topics to enable researchers to understand the methods, providing rigorous
practical and theoretical insights into the benefits and challenges of using
them. The main aim of the identified model is to predict new data from previous
observations. This can be achieved with different deep learning based modelling
techniques and we discuss architectures commonly adopted in the literature,
like feedforward, convolutional, and recurrent networks. Their parameters have
to be estimated from past data trying to optimize the prediction performance.
For this purpose, we discuss a specific set of first-order optimization tools
that is emerged as efficient. The survey then draws connections to the
well-studied area of kernel-based methods. They control the data fit by
regularization terms that penalize models not in line with prior assumptions.
We illustrate how to cast them in deep architectures to obtain deep
kernel-based methods. The success of deep learning also resulted in surprising
empirical observations, like the counter-intuitive behaviour of models with
many parameters. We discuss the role of overparameterized models, including
their connection to kernels, as well as implicit regularization mechanisms

reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted downlink rate-splitting
multiple access (RSMA) transmission system is studied. In the considered model,
the active RIS is deployed to overcome severe power attenuation, which is
caused by the cumulative product of RIS incidence path loss and the reflection
path loss. Since the active RIS can adjust both the phase and the amplitude of
the incident signal simultaneously, the RIS control scheme requires delicate
design to improve RSMA communication performance. To address this issue, a
sum-rate maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize the beamforming
vectors, rate allocation vector, and RIS precoding matrix. To solve this
non-convex sum-rate maximization problem, an iterative algorithm based on
fractional programming (FP) and quadratic constraint quadratic programming
(QCQP) is proposed. In particular, the proposed algorithm firstly decomposes
the original problem into two subproblems, namely, 1) beamforming and rate
allocation optimization and 2) active RIS precoding optimization. The
corresponding variables of the two subproblems are optimized through sequential
convex approximation (SCA) and block coordinate descent (BCD), respectively.
Numerical results show that the proposed active RIS-aided RSMA system could
increase the sum-rate by up to 45% over the conventional passive RIS-aided RSMA
system with the same energy consumption.

stress tensor and the symmetric part of the velocity gradient is
\emph{nonlinear}. The majority of such studies however concerns models where
such a dependence is \emph{explicit} (the stress is a function of the velocity

materials. To achieve sub-micrometer or even nanometer-scale spatial
resolution, it is important to focus the incident light beam (usually from the
synchrotron radiation) using X-ray optics such as the zone plate or ellipsoidal
capillary mirrors. Recently, we developed a laser-based {\mu}-ARPES with
spin-resolution (LMS-ARPES). The 177 nm laser beam is achieved by frequency
doubling a 355 nm beam using a KBBF crystal and subsequently focused using an
optical lens with a focal length of about 16 mm. By characterizing the focused
spot size using different methods and performing spatial-scanning photoemission
measurement, we confirm the sub-micron spatial resolution of the system.
Compared with the {\mu}-ARPES facilities based on synchrotron radiation, our
LMS-ARPES system is not only more economical and convenient but also with
higher photon flux (> 5E13 photons/s), thus enabling the high-resolution and
high-statistics measurements. Moreover, the system is equipped with a
two-dimensional spin detector based on exchange scattering at a
surface-passivated iron film grown on a W(100) substrate. We investigate the
spin structure of the prototype topological insulator Bi2Se3 and reveal a high

elastic wave equation is written as an integral equation of the
Lippmann-Schwinger type, and the seismic source is represented as a general
moment tensor. The displacement field due to a moment tensor source can be
computed using the spatial derivative of the elastodynamic Green's function.
The existing matrix-based implementation of the integral equation is
computationally inefficient to model the wavefield in a three-dimensional
earth. An integral equation for the particle displacement is, hence, formulated
in a matrix-free manner through the application of the Fourier transform. The
biconjugate gradient stabilized method is used to iteratively obtain the
solution of this equation. We apply the numerical scheme to three different
models in order of increasing geological complexity and obtain the elastic
displacement fields corresponding to the different types of moment tensor
sources. The volume integral method has an advantage over the time domain
methods in regard to adding multiple sources since it can work with discrete

attackers to divert Internet traffic and consequently perpetrate service
disruptions, monetary frauds, and even citizen surveillance for decades.
State-of-the-art defenses rely on geo-distributed BGP monitors to detect rogue
BGP announcements. As we show, though, attackers can easily evade detection by
engineering their announcements.
  This paper presents Oscilloscope, an approach to accurately detect BGP
hijacks by relying on real-time traffic analysis. As hijacks inevitably change
the characteristics of the diverted traffic, the key idea is to track these
changes in real time and flag them. The main challenge is that ""normal""
Internet events (e.g., network reconfigurations, link failures, load balancing)
also change the underlying traffic characteristics - and they are way more
frequent than hijacks. Naive traffic analyses would hence lead to too many
false positives.
  We observe that hijacks typically target a subset of the prefixes announced
by Internet service providers and only divert a subset of their traffic. In
contrast, normal events lead to more uniform changes across prefixes and
traffic. Oscilloscope uses this observation to filter out non-hijack events by
checking whether they affect multiple related prefixes or not.
  Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that Oscilloscope quickly and
accurately detects hijacks in realistic traffic traces containing hundreds of
events.

to scale Bayesian optimisation (BO) to high-dimensional problems. However, the

between the actual black-box and its surrogate as provided by the
decomposition. Those results motivate the development of the random
decomposition upper-confidence bound algorithm (RDUCB) that is straightforward

instead of resolving gender bias, intrinsic mitigation techniques and metrics

eversion robots also present significant challenges, one of which is
maintaining sensory payload at the tip without restricting the eversion

consequent ability to navigate through narrow openings. Here, we address these

(2+1)d deconfined quantum phase transition (DQPT), and the conformal field
theory (CFT) can be utilized. The dynamics of DQPT in the Kagome lattice are
explored by using a combination of large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations
and stochastic analytic continuation. In the valence-bonded solid phase, the
fragmentation of a nearly flat band with a finite energy gap is observed around
the K point. At the deconfined quantum critical point, besides the linear
dispersion at the $\Gamma$ point, another one is found at the K point.
Counterintuitively, these two gapless modes take different speeds equal to
0.319(8) and 0.101(9), indicating the absence of Lorentz symmetry. After
carefully inspecting the snapshot of the simulation, we discovered the fast
mode at $\Gamma$ point corresponding to the deconfinement of spinons
(fractional charges), and the slow mode at K point is related to the quantum
string ( generalized symmetry). Our work will extend the understanding of phase
transition, and intrigue the field of topological quantum field theory.

platforms, batching is an important technique for providing efficient and
economical services at scale. In particular, parallel computing resources on
the platforms, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), have higher
computational and energy efficiency with larger batch sizes. However, larger
batch sizes may also result in longer response time, and thus it requires a
judicious design. This paper aims to provide a dynamic batching policy that
strikes a balance between efficiency and latency. The GPU-based inference
service is modeled as a batch service queue with batch-size dependent
processing time. Then, the design of dynamic batching is a continuous-time
average-cost problem, and is formulated as a semi-Markov decision process
(SMDP) with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of average response
time and average power consumption. The optimal policy is acquired by solving
an associated discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP) problem with finite
state approximation and ""discretization"". By introducing an abstract cost to
reflect the impact of ""tail"" states, the space complexity and the time
complexity of the procedure can decrease by 63.5% and 98%, respectively. Our
results show that the optimal policies potentially possess a control limit
structure. Numerical results also show that SMDP-based batching policies can
adapt to different traffic intensities and outperform other benchmark policies.
Furthermore, the proposed solution has notable flexibility in balancing power
consumption and latency.

more common. Recently qualitative simulations of boiling phenomena have been
undertaken by a large number of research groups. One seldom discussed
limitations is that large values of gravitational forcing are required to
simulate the detachment and rising of bubbles formed at a bottom surface. The
forces are typically so large that neglecting the effects of varying pressure
in the system becomes questionable. In this paper we examine the effect of
large pressure variations induced by gravity using pseudopotential lattice
Boltzmann simulations. These pressure variations lead to height dependent
conditions for phase co-existence and nucleation of either gas or liquid
domains. Because these effects have not previously been studied in the context
of these simulation methods we focus here on the phase-stability in a one
dimensional system, rather than the additional complexity of bubble or droplet
dynamics. Even in this simple case we find that the different forms of
gravitational forces employed in the literature lead to qualitatively different
phenomena, leading to the conclusion that the effects of gravity induced
pressure variations on phase-change phenomena should be very carefully
considered when trying to advance boiling and cavitation as well as
liquefaction simulations to become quantitative tools.

approach can drastically reduce spurious Doppler variability from known
physical effects such as spots, rotation and convective blueshift. We identify
the combinations of activity indices with most predictive power. When applied
to real observations, we observe a good match of the correction with the
observed variability, but we also find that the noise reduction is not as good
as in the simulations, probably due to the lack of detail in the simulated
physics. We demonstrate that a model-driven machine learning approach is
sufficient to clean Doppler signals from activity induced variability for well
known physical effects. There are dozens of known activity related observables
whose inversion power remains unexplored indicating that the use of additional
indicators, more complete models, and more observations with optimised sampling
strategies can lead to significant improvements in our detrending capabilities.

similarities between two time series. It is especially valuable in a wide
variety of applications, such as clustering, anomaly detection, classification,
or video segmentation, where the time-series have different timescales, are
irregularly sampled, or are shifted. However, it is not prone to be considered
as a loss function in an end-to-end learning framework because of its
non-differentiability and its quadratic temporal complexity. While
differentiable variants of DTW have been introduced by the community, they
still present some drawbacks: computing the distance is still expensive and
this similarity tends to blur some differences in the time-series. In this
paper, we propose a fast and differentiable approximation of DTW by comparing
two architectures: the first one for learning an embedding in which the
Euclidean distance mimics the DTW, and the second one for directly predicting
the DTW output using regression. We build the former by training a siamese
neural network to regress the DTW value between two time-series. Depending on
the nature of the activation function, this approximation naturally supports
differentiation, and it is efficient to compute. We show, in a time-series

bandgap Zn0.9Mg0.1Te nanowire cores are fabricated in a molecular beam epitaxy
system by employing the vapor-liquid-solid growth mechanism. Additionally, this
structure is coated with a thin ZnSe radial shell which forms type II interface
with the dot semiconductor. The resulting radial electron-hole separation is
evidenced by several distinct effects which occur in the presence of ZnSe
shell, including: the optical emission redshift of about 250 meV, a significant
decrease of the emission intensity, the increase of the excitonic lifetime by
one order of magnitude and the increase of the biexciton binding energy. The
type II nanowire quantum dots where electrons and holes are radially separated
constitute a promising platform for potential applications in the field of
quantum information technology.

  micro-regions to accelerate the transition to cargo-bike logistics",,"NeurIPS 2022 Workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine
  Learning",,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Light goods vehicles (LGV) used extensively in the last mile of delivery are
one of the leading polluters in cities. Cargo-bike logistics has been put
forward as a high impact candidate for replacing LGVs, with experts estimating
over half of urban van deliveries being replaceable by cargo bikes, due to
their faster speeds, shorter parking times and more efficient routes across
cities. By modelling the relative delivery performance of different vehicle
types across urban micro-regions, machine learning can help operators evaluate
the business and environmental impact of adding cargo-bikes to their fleets. In
this paper, we introduce two datasets, and present initial progress in
modelling urban delivery service time (e.g. cruising for parking, unloading,
walking). Using Uber's H3 index to divide the cities into hexagonal cells, and
aggregating OpenStreetMap tags for each cell, we show that urban context is a
critical predictor of delivery performance.

emerged as a label-free imaging tool, capable of resolving cell types and
organelles within 3D live samples, whilst monitoring their activity at tens of
milliseconds resolution. Here, a D-FFOCT module design is presented which can
be coupled to a commercial microscope with a stage top incubator, allowing
non-invasive label-free longitudinal imaging over periods of minutes to weeks
on the same sample. Long term volumetric imaging on human induced pluripotent
stem cell-derived retinal organoids is demonstrated, highlighting tissue and
cell organisation as well as cell shape, motility and division. Imaging on
retinal explants highlights single 3D cone and rod structures. An optimal
workflow for data acquisition, postprocessing and saving is demonstrated,
resulting in a time gain factor of 10 compared to prior state of the art.
Finally, a method to increase D-FFOCT signal-to-noise ratio is demonstrated,
allowing rapid organoid screening.

  kinematic calculations","17 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.EP cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Context: The sizes of dust in the interstellar medium follows a distribution
where most of the dust mass is in smaller grains. However, the re-distribution
from larger grains towards smaller sizes especially by means of rotational
disruption is poorly understood. Aims: We aim to study the dynamics of porous
grain aggregates under accelerated ration. Especially, we determine the
deformation of the grains and the maximal angular velocity up to the rotational
disruption event by caused by centrifugal forces. Methods: We pre-calculate
aggregates my means of ballistic aggregation analogous to the interstellar dust
as input for subsequent numerical simulations. In detail, we perform
three-dimensional N-body simulations mimicking the radiative torque spin-up
process up to the point where the grain aggregates become rotationally
disrupted. Results: Our simulations results are in agreement with theoretical
models predicting a characteristic angular velocity $\omega_{\mathrm{disr}}$ of
the order of ${ 10^8 - 10^9\ \mathrm{rad\ s^{-1}} }$, where grains become
rotationally disrupted. In contrast to theoretical predictions, we show that
for large porous aggregates ($< 300\ \mathrm{nm}$) $\omega_{\mathrm{disr}}$
reaches a lower asymptotic value. Hence, such grains can withstand an
accelerated ration more efficiently up to a factor of 10 because the
displacement of mass by centrifugal forces and the subsequent mechanical
deformation supports the buildup of new connections within the aggregate.
Furthermore, we report that the rapid rotation of grains deforms an ensemble
with initially 50:50 prolate and oblate shapes, respectively, preferentially
into oblate shapes. Finally, we present a best fit formula to predict the
average rotational disruption of an ensemble of porous dust aggregates
dependent on internal grain structure, total number of monomers, and applied
material properties.

Statistics (HOWLS) project is to assess, compare, and combine the constraining
power of $10$ different HOS on a common set of $Euclid$-like mocks, derived
from N-body simulations. In this first paper of the HOWLS series we compute the
non-tomographic ($\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\sigma_8$) Fisher information for one-point
probability distribution function, peak counts, Minkowski functionals, Betti
numbers, persistent homology Betti numbers and heatmap, and scattering
transform coefficients, and compare them to the shear and convergence two-point
correlation functions in the absence of any systematic bias. We also include
forecasts for three implementations of higher-order moments, but these cannot
be robustly interpreted as the Gaussian likelihood assumption breaks down for
these statistics. Taken individually, we find that each HOS outperforms the
two-point statistics by a factor of around $2$ in the precision of the
forecasts with some variations across statistics and cosmological parameters.
When combining all the HOS, this increases to a $4.5$ times improvement,
highlighting the immense potential of HOS for cosmic shear cosmological
analyses with $Euclid$. The data used in this analysis are publicly released

models, generate an ongoing information flux that can be quantified with the
mutual information $I\left[\vec{x}(t),\vec{x}(t\!+\!1)\right]$ between
subsequent system states $\vec{x}$. Although, former studies have shown that
$I$ depends on the statistics of the network's connection weights, it is
unclear (1) how to maximize $I$ systematically and (2) how to quantify the flux
in large systems where computing the mutual information becomes intractable.
Here, we address these questions using Boltzmann machines as model systems. We
find that in networks with moderately strong connections, the mutual
information $I$ is approximately a monotonic transformation of the
root-mean-square averaged Pearson correlations between neuron-pairs, a quantity
that can be efficiently computed even in large systems. Furthermore,
evolutionary maximization of $I\left[\vec{x}(t),\vec{x}(t\!+\!1)\right]$
reveals a general design principle for the weight matrices enabling the
systematic construction of systems with a high spontaneous information flux.
Finally, we simultaneously maximize information flux and the mean period length
of cyclic attractors in the state space of these dynamical networks. Our
results are potentially useful for the construction of RNNs that serve as
short-time memories or pattern generators.

employing heat maps produced by an optimized printing protocol simulation and
used for training a specifically tailored recurrent neural network in terms of

  In order to train the neural network, we adopt a well-engineered simulation

gradient across the plate, a cost function is introduced as the core criteria,
which is inspired and optimized by considering the well-known traveling
salesman problem (TSP). As time evolves the unsupervised printing process
governed by TSP produces a history of temperature heat maps that maintain
minimized average thermal gradient.

diffusion of wave packets in momentum space. The expectation is that dynamical
localization will occur when the typical transport time of the momentum
diffusion is greater than the Heisenberg time. The transport time is typically
computed from the corresponding classical dynamics. In this paper, we present
an alternative approach based purely on the study of spectral fluctuations of
the quantum system. The information about the transport times is encoded in the
spectral form factor, which is the Fourier transform of the two-point spectral
autocorrelation function. We compute large samples of the energy spectra (of
the order of $10^6$ levels) and spectral form factors of 22 stadium billiards
with parameter values across the transition between the localized and extended
eigenstate regimes. The transport time is obtained from the point when the
spectral form factor transitions from the non-universal to the universal regime
predicted by random matrix theory. We study the dependence of the transport
time on the parameter value and show the level repulsion exponents, that are
known to be a good measure of dynamical localization, depend linearly on the

human operators, resulting in small dataset sizes. This is especially true for
dense regression problems such as crowd counting which requires the location of
every person in the image to be annotated. Techniques such as data augmentation
and synthetic data generation based on simulations can help in such cases. In
this paper, we introduce PromptMix, a method for artificially boosting the size
of existing datasets, that can be used to improve the performance of
lightweight networks. First, synthetic images are generated in an end-to-end
data-driven manner, where text prompts are extracted from existing datasets via
an image captioning deep network, and subsequently introduced to text-to-image
diffusion models. The generated images are then annotated using one or more
high-performing deep networks, and mixed with the real dataset for training the
lightweight network. By extensive experiments on five datasets and two tasks,
we show that PromptMix can significantly increase the performance of
lightweight networks by up to 26%.

thermal boundary layers and to contribute to the understanding of the dynamics
of passive scalars at different Prandtl numbers. In this regard, a direct
numerical simulation (DNS) of an incompressible zero-pressure-gradient
turbulent boundary layer is performed with the Reynolds number based on
momentum thickness $Re_{\theta}$ up to $1080$. Four passive scalars,
characterized by the Prandtl numbers $Pr = 1,2,4,6$ are simulated with constant
Dirichlet boundary conditions, using the pseudo-spectral code SIMSON (Chevalier
et al. 2007). To the best of our knowledge, the present direct numerical
simulation provides the thermal boundary layer with the highest Prandtl number
available in the literature. It corresponds to that of water at
$\sim$24$^{o}C$, when the fluid temperature is considered as a passive scalar.
Turbulence statistics for the flow and thermal fields are computed and compared
with available numerical simulations at similar Reynolds numbers. The mean flow
and temperature profiles, root-mean squared (RMS) velocity and temperature
fluctuations, turbulent heat flux, turbulent Prandtl number and higher-order
statistics agree well with the numerical data reported in the literature.
Furthermore, the pre-multiplied two-dimensional spectra of the velocity and of
the passive scalars are computed, providing a quantitative description of the
energy distribution at the different lengthscales for various wall-normal
locations. The energy distribution of the heat flux fields at the wall is
concentrated on longer temporal structures and exhibits different footprint at
the wall, with increasing Prandtl number.

width (sigma_{[OIII]}) and stellar velocity dispersion (sigma_{*}), utilizing a
sample of 740 type 1 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with high-quality spectra at
redshift z < 1.0. We find the broad correlation between the core component of
[OIII] emission line width (sigma_{[OIII,core]}) and sigma_{*} with a scatter
of 0.11~dex for the low redshift (z < 0.1) sample; for redshift (0.3 < z < 1.0)
AGNs, the scatter is larger, being 0.16~dex. We also find that the Eddington
ratio (L_{bol}/L_{Edd}) may play an important role in the discrepancies between
sigma_{[OIII,core]} and sigma_{*}. As the L_{bol}/L_{Edd} increases,
sigma_{[OIII,core]} tends to be larger than sigma_{*}. By classifying our local
sample with different minor-to-major axis ratios, we find that sigma_{*} is
larger than sigma_{[OIII,core]} for those edge-on spiral galaxies. In addition,
we also find that the effects of outflow strength properties such as maximum
outflow velocity (V_{max}) and the broader component of [OIII] emission line
width and line shift (sigma_{[OIII,out]} and V_{[OIII,out]}) may play a major
role in the discrepancies between sigma_{[OIII,core]} and sigma_{*}. The
discrepancies between sigma_{[OIII,core]} and sigma_{*} are larger when
V_{max}, V_{[OIII,out]}, and sigma_{[OIII,out]} increase. Our results show that
the outflow strengths may have significant effects on the differences between
narrow-line region gas and stellar kinematics in AGNs. We suggest that caution
should be taken when using sigma_{[OIII,core]} as a surrogate for sigma_{*}. In
addition, the substitute of sigma_{[OIII,core]} for sigma_{*} could be used
only for low luminosity AGNs.

1RXS J170849.0-400910, jointly analysed with a new Swift observation and
archival NICER data. The total (energy and phase integrated) emission in the
2-8 keV energy range is linerarly polarized, at a ~35% level. The
phase-averaged polarization signal shows a marked increase with energy, ranging
from ~20% at 2-3 keV up to ~80% at 6-8 keV, while the polarization angle remain
constant. This indicates that radiation is mostly polarized in a single
direction. The spectrum is well reproduced by a combination of either two
thermal (blackbody) components or a blackbody and a power law. Both the
polarization degree and angle also show a variation with the spin phase, and
the former is almost anti-correlated with the source counts in the 2-8 keV and
2-4 keV bands. We discuss the possible implications and interpretations, based
on a joint analysis of the spectral, polarization and pulsation properties of
the source. A scenario in which the surface temperature is not homogeneous,
with a hotter cap covered by a gaseous atmosphere and a warmer region in a
condensed state, provides a satisfactory description of both the phase- and
energy-dependent spectro-polarimetric data. The (comparatively) small size of
the two emitting regions, required to explain the observed pulsations, does not
allow to reach a robust conclusion about the presence of vacuum birefringence

""student"" network by hoping to mimic soft probabilities of a ""teacher"" network.
Yet, for self-distillation to work, the student must somehow deviate from the
teacher (Stanton et al., 2021). But what is the nature of these deviations, and
how do they relate to gains in generalization? We investigate these questions
through a series of experiments across image and language classification
datasets. First, we observe that distillation consistently deviates in a
characteristic way: on points where the teacher has low confidence, the student
achieves even lower confidence than the teacher. Secondly, we find that
deviations in the initial dynamics of training are not crucial -- simply
switching to distillation loss in the middle of training can recover much of
its gains. We then provide two parallel theoretical perspectives to understand
the role of student-teacher deviations in our experiments, one casting
distillation as a regularizer in eigenspace, and another as a gradient
denoiser. Our analysis bridges several gaps between existing theory and
practice by (a) focusing on gradient-descent training, (b) by avoiding label
noise assumptions, and (c) by unifying several disjoint empirical and
theoretical findings.

Performance evaluation shows that $\mathcal{KP}$ is computationally efficient:
In some cases, the evaluation time (validation+test) of a KG completion method

days or lags. Distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM) are a well-established
statistical framework for estimating an exposure-lag-response function. We
propose methods to allow for prior information to be incorporated into DLNMs.
First, we impose a monotonicity constraint in the exposure-response at lagged
time periods which matches with knowledge on how biological mechanisms respond
to increased levels of exposures. Second, we introduce variable selection into
the DLNM to identify lagged periods of susceptibility with respect to the
outcome of interest. The variable selection approach allows for direct
application of informative priors on which lags have nonzero association with
the outcome. We propose a tree-of-trees model that uses two layers of trees:
one for splitting the exposure time frame and one for fitting exposure-response
functions over different time periods. We introduce a zero-inflated alternative
to the tree splitting prior in Bayesian additive regression trees to allow for
lag selection and the addition of informative priors. We develop a
computational approach for efficient posterior sampling and perform a

approaches. We apply our method to estimate time-lagged extreme temperature

systems theory can be used for this purpose. In this review, we present a
concise theoretical and numerical framework focusing on practical aspects of
the computation and stability analyses of steady and time-periodic solutions,
with emphasis on high-dimensional systems such as those arising from the
spatial discretization of the Navier-Stokes equations. Using a matrix-free
approach based on Krylov methods, we extend the capabilities of the open-source
high-performance spectral element-based time-stepper Nek5000. The numerical
methods discussed are implemented in nekStab, an open-source and user-friendly
add-on toolbox dedicated to the study of stability properties of flows in
complex three-dimensional geometries. The performance and accuracy of the
methods are illustrated and examined using standard benchmarks from the fluid
mechanics literature. Thanks to its flexibility and domain-agnostic nature, the
methodology presented in this work can be applied to develop similar toolboxes
for other solvers, most importantly outside the field of fluid mechanics.

the loss functions can change arbitrarily over $K$ episodes and the state space

in some known features, that is, a linear function approximation exists. The
best existing regret upper bound for this setting (Luo et al., 2021) is of
order $\tilde{\mathcal O}(K^{2/3})$ (omitting all other dependencies), given
access to a simulator. This paper provides two algorithms that improve the
regret to $\tilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt K)$ in the same setting. Our first
algorithm makes use of a refined analysis of the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader
(FTRL) algorithm with the log-barrier regularizer. This analysis allows the
loss estimators to be arbitrarily negative and might be of independent
interest. Our second algorithm develops a magnitude-reduced loss estimator,
further removing the polynomial dependency on the number of actions in the
first algorithm and leading to the optimal regret bound (up to logarithmic
terms and dependency on the horizon). Moreover, we also extend the first
algorithm to simulator-free linear MDPs, which achieves $\tilde{\mathcal
O}(K^{8/9})$ regret and greatly improves over the best existing bound
$\tilde{\mathcal O}(K^{14/15})$. This algorithm relies on a better alternative
to the Matrix Geometric Resampling procedure by Neu & Olkhovskaya (2020), which

(b) learning the expectation values of local observables within a thermal or
quantum phase of matter. In both cases, we wish to minimise the number of
samples we use to learn these properties to a given precision.
  For the first task, we develop new techniques to learn parameterisations of
classes of systems, including quantum Gibbs states of non-commuting
Hamiltonians with exponential decay of correlations and the approximate Markov
property. We show it is possible to infer the expectation values of all
extensive properties of the state from a number of copies that not only scales
polylogarithmically with the system size, but polynomially in the observable's

expected values of quasi-local observables and entropies.
  For the second task, we develop efficient algorithms for learning observables
in a phase of matter of a quantum system. By exploiting the locality of the
Hamiltonian, we show that $M$ local observables can be learned with probability
$1-\delta$ to precision $\epsilon$ with using only
$N=O\big(\log\big(\frac{M}{\delta}\big)e^{polylog(\epsilon^{-1})}\big)$ samples

results apply to both families of ground states of Hamiltonians displaying
local topological quantum order, and thermal phases of matter with exponential
decay of correlations. In addition, our sample complexity applies to the worse
case setting whereas previous results only applied on average.

program policies that describe out-of-distributionally complex behaviors and
directly assign credits to programs that induce desired behaviors. The
experimental results in the Karel domain show that our proposed framework
outperforms baselines. The ablation studies confirm the limitations of LEAPS

implementation in real-world scenarios, the fairness and privacy of GNNs have
attracted considerable interest since they are two essential social concerns in
the era of building trustworthy GNNs. Existing studies have respectively
explored the fairness and privacy of GNNs and exhibited that both fairness and
privacy are at the cost of GNN performance. However, the interaction between
them is yet to be explored and understood. In this paper, we investigate the
interaction between the fairness of a GNN and its privacy for the first time.
We empirically identify that edge privacy risks increase when the individual
fairness of nodes is improved. Next, we present the intuition behind such a
trade-off and employ the influence function and Pearson correlation to measure
it theoretically. To take the performance, fairness, and privacy of GNNs into
account simultaneously, we propose implementing fairness-aware reweighting and
privacy-aware graph structure perturbation modules in a retraining mechanism.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective in implementing
GNN fairness with limited performance cost and restricted privacy risks.

cognitive resources to teams at the risk of increased conflict. Few studies
have investigated how different types of diversity impact Agile software teams.
This study views diversity through the lens of the categorization-elaboration
model (CEM). We investigated how diversity in gender, age, role, and cultural
background impacts team effectiveness and conflict, and how these associations
are moderated by psychological safety. Our sample consisted of 1,118
participants from 161 teams and was analyzed with Covariance-Based Structural
Equation Modeling (CB-SEM). We found a positive effect of age diversity on team
effectiveness and gender diversity on relational conflict. Psychological safety
contributed directly to effective teamwork and less conflict but did not
moderate the diversity-effectiveness link. While our results are consistent
with the CEM theory for age and gender diversity, other types of diversity did
not yield similar results. We discuss several reasons for this, including
curvilinear effects, moderators such as task interdependence, or the presence
of a diversity mindset. With this paper, we argue that a dichotomous nature of
diversity is oversimplified. Indeed, it is a complex relationship where context
plays a pivotal role. A deeper understanding of diversity through the lens of
theories such as the CEM may lead to more effective teamwork.

bargaining solution making a reasonable trade-off between economic and

Instead, we assign a group of dynamic weights in the objective function of the

eigenstates or over the three Standard Model flavors. We review how high scale
nonunitarity arises after integrating out new physics which is not accessible
in neutrino oscillation experiments. In particular, we stress that high scale
unitarity violation is only apparent and what happens is that the neutrino
flavor states become nonorthogonal due to new physics. Since the flavor space
is complete, unitarity has to be preserved in time evolution and that the
probabilities of a flavor state oscillates to all possible flavor states always
sum up to unity. We highlight the need to modify the expression of probability
to preserve unitarity when the flavor states are nonorthogonal. We will
continue to call this high scale unitarity violation in reference to a
nonunitary $\mathbf{U}$. We contrast this to the low scale nonunitarity
scenario in which there are new states accessible in neutrino oscillation
experiments but the oscillations involving these states are fast enough such
that they are averaged out. We further derive analytical formula for the
neutrino oscillation amplitude involving $N$ neutrino flavors without assuming
a unitarity $\mathbf{U}$ which allows us to prove a theorem that if
$\left(\mathbf{U}\mathbf{U}^{\dagger}\right)_{\alpha\beta}=0$ for all

  and aggregated building loads",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Optimal decision-making compels us to anticipate the future at different
horizons. However, in many domains connecting together predictions from
multiple time horizons and abstractions levels across their organization
becomes all the more important, else decision-makers would be planning using
separate and possibly conflicting views of the future. This notably applies to
smart grid operation. To optimally manage energy flows in such systems,
accurate and coherent predictions must be made across varying aggregation
levels and horizons. With this work, we propose a novel multi-dimensional
hierarchical forecasting method built upon structurally-informed
machine-learning regressors and established hierarchical reconciliation
taxonomy. A generic formulation of multi-dimensional hierarchies, reconciling
spatial and temporal hierarchies under a common frame is initially defined.
Next, a coherency-informed hierarchical learner is developed built upon a
custom loss function leveraging optimal reconciliation methods. Coherency of
the produced hierarchical forecasts is then secured using similar
reconciliation technics. The outcome is a unified and coherent forecast across
all examined dimensions. The method is evaluated on two different case studies
to predict building electrical loads across spatial, temporal, and
spatio-temporal hierarchies. Although the regressor natively profits from
computationally efficient learning, results displayed disparate performances,
demonstrating the value of hierarchical-coherent learning in only one setting.
Yet, supported by a comprehensive result analysis, existing obstacles were
clearly delineated, presenting distinct pathways for future work. Overall, the
paper expands and unites traditionally disjointed hierarchical forecasting
methods providing a fertile route toward a novel generation of forecasting
regressors.

  Example",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks are widely known to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples, especially showing significantly poor performance on adversarial
examples generated under the white-box setting. However, most white-box attack
methods rely heavily on the target model and quickly get stuck in local optima,
resulting in poor adversarial transferability. The momentum-based methods and
their variants are proposed to escape the local optima for better
transferability. In this work, we notice that the transferability of
adversarial examples generated by the iterative fast gradient sign method
(I-FGSM) exhibits a decreasing trend when increasing the number of iterations.
Motivated by this finding, we argue that the information of adversarial
perturbations near the benign sample, especially the direction, benefits more
on the transferability. Thus, we propose a novel strategy, which uses the
Scheduled step size and the Dual example (SD), to fully utilize the adversarial
information near the benign sample. Our proposed strategy can be easily
integrated with existing adversarial attack methods for better adversarial
transferability. Empirical evaluations on the standard ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly enhance the
transferability of existing adversarial attacks.

firstly, resolving sandhi to split a phrase into words, and, secondly,
splitting long compounds into their components. This paper presents a simpler
method of tokenizing a Sanskrit text for n-grams, by using n-aksaras, or
contiguous sequences of aksaras. This model reduces the need for sandhi
resolution, making it much easier to use on raw text. It is also possible to
use this model on Sanskrit-adjacent texts, e.g., a Tamil commentary on a

the cosmogenic activity of relevant long-lived radioisotopes induced in the

simulated counting rates in the detector due to cosmogenic isotopes, it is
concluded that activation in copper and stainless steel is not problematic.
Activation of titanium, considered in early designs but not used in the final

purification and transport on surface, in baseline conditions, is evaluated to
be 2.8% of the activity measured in UAr from the same source, and thus

the mean infectious dose (one quantum, by definition in epidemiology) be

luminous dusty star forming galaxies (DSFGs) at 2 < z < 4 with the NSF's Karl
G. Jansky Very Large Array. All sources are detected in CO(1-0), with an
~1arcsec angular resolution. Seven sources show extended and complex structure.
We measure CO luminosities of $({\mu})L'_{CO(1-0)}=0.4-2.9x10^{11}$ K km
s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$, and molecular gas masses of (${\mu}$)M$_{H2}$ = 1.3 - 8.6 x
10$^{11}$ Mo, where ({\mu}) is the magnification factor. The derived molecular
gas depletion times of t$_{\rm dep}$ = 40 - 460 Myr, cover the expected range
of both normal star forming galaxies and starbursts. Comparing to the higher-J
CO transitions previously observed for the same sources, we find CO temperature
brightness ratios of r$_{32/10}$ = 0.4 - 1.4, r$_{43/10}$ = 0.4 - 1.7, and
r$_{54/10}$ = 0.3 - 1.3. We find a wide range of CO spectral line energy
distributions (SLEDs), in agreement with other high-z DSFGs, with the exception
of three sources that are most comparable to the Cloverleaf and APM08279+5255.
Based on radiative transfer modelling of the CO SLEDs we determine densities of
n$_{H2}$ = 0.3 - 8.5 x 10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of T$_K$ = 100 - 200
K. Lastly, four sources are detected in the continuum, three have radio
emission consistent with their infrared derived star formation rates, while
HerBS-70E requires an additional synchrotron radiation component from an active
galactic nucleus. Overall, we find that even though the sample is similarly
luminous in the infrared, by tracing the CO(1-0) emission a diversity of galaxy
and excitation properties are revealed, demonstrating the importance of CO(1-0)
observations in combination to higher-J transitions.

comparing maximum weakness and minimum description length in the context of

determining the safe operation in a normal situation and some contingencies
scenarios. Electrical variables as input variables of the model are mainly
considered to indicate the power system operation as secure or insecure,
according to the reliability criteria for contingency scenarios. In this
approach, the features are in grid format data, where the relation between
features and any knowledge of network topology is absent. Moreover, the
traditional and common models, such as neural networks (NN), are not applicable
if the input variables are in the graph format structure. Therefore, this paper
examines the security analysis in the graph neural network (GNN) framework such
that the GNN model incorporates the network connection and node's neighbors'
influence for the assessment. Here the input features are separated graphs
representing different network conditions in electrical and structural
statuses. Topological characteristics defined by network centrality measures
are added in the feature vector representing the structural properties of the
network. The proposed model is simulated in the IEEE 118-Bus system for the
voltage static security assessment (SSA). The performance indices validate the
efficiency of the GNN-based model compared to the traditional NN model denoting
that the information enclosed in graph data boosts the classifier performance
since the GNN model benefits the neighbors' features. Moreover, outperforming
of GNN-based model is determined when robustness and sensitivity analyzes are
carried out. The proposed method is not limited to a specific task and can be
extended for other security assessments with different critical variables, such
as dynamic analysis and frequency criteria, respectively.

Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (JTWPAs). Specifically, the
JTWPA concept we investigate is using flux-biased nonhysteretic rf-SQUIDs in a
transmission line configuration, which harnesses the three-wave mixing (3WM)
regime. Dispersion engineering enables phasematching to achieve power gain of
$\sim$20 dB, while suppressing the generation of unwanted mixing processes. Two
dispersion engineering concepts using a 3WM-JTWPA circuit model, i.e., resonant
phase-matching (RPM) and periodic capacitance modulation (PCM), are discussed,
with results potentially also applicable to four-wave-mixing (4WM) JTWPAs. We
propose suitable circuit parameter sets and evaluate amplifier performance with
and without circuit parameter variance using transient circuit simulations.
This approach inherently takes into account microwave reflections, unwanted
mixing products, imperfect phasematching, pump depletion, etc. In the case of
RPM the resonance frequency spread is critical, while PCM is much less
sensitive to parameter spread. We discuss degrees of freedom to make the JTWPA
circuits more tolerant to parameter spread. Finally, our analysis shows that
the flux-bias point where rf-SQUIDs exhibit Kerr-free nonlinearity is close to
the sweet spot regarding critical current spread.

collaboratively train deep models without exchanging the raw data. However, the
data distribution among clients is naturally non-i.i.d., which leads to severe
degradation of the learnt model. The primary goal of this paper is to develop a
robust federated learning algorithm to address feature shift in clients'
samples, which can be caused by various factors, e.g., acquisition differences
in medical imaging. To reach this goal, we propose FedFA to tackle federated
learning from a distinct perspective of federated feature augmentation. FedFA
is based on a major insight that each client's data distribution can be
characterized by statistics (i.e., mean and standard deviation) of latent
features; and it is likely to manipulate these local statistics globally, i.e.,
based on information in the entire federation, to let clients have a better
sense of the underlying distribution and therefore alleviate local data bias.
Based on this insight, we propose to augment each local feature statistic
probabilistically based on a normal distribution, whose mean is the original
statistic and variance quantifies the augmentation scope. Key to our approach
is the determination of a meaningful Gaussian variance, which is accomplished
by taking into account not only biased data of each individual client, but also
underlying feature statistics characterized by all participating clients. We
offer both theoretical and empirical justifications to verify the effectiveness
of FedFA. Our code is available at https://github.com/tfzhou/FedFA.

operators was that polynomials can accurately approximate the solution, and SBP
operators should thus be exact for them. However, polynomials do not provide
the best approximation for some problems, with other approximation spaces being
more appropriate. We recently addressed this issue and developed a theory for
one-dimensional SBP operators based on general function spaces, coined
function-space SBP (FSBP) operators. In this paper, we extend the theory of
FSBP operators to multiple dimensions. We focus on their existence, connection
to quadratures, construction, and mimetic properties. A more exhaustive
numerical demonstration of multi-dimensional FSBP (MFSBP) operators and their
application will be provided in future works. Similar to the one-dimensional
case, we demonstrate that most of the established results for polynomial-based
multi-dimensional SBP (MSBP) operators carry over to the more general class of
MFSBP operators. Our findings imply that the concept of SBP operators can be
applied to a significantly larger class of methods than is currently done. This
can increase the accuracy of the numerical solutions and/or provide stability
to the methods.

alternative to changing the shape parameter, we demonstrate how the
least-squares approach can be used to construct stable RBF-QFs by allowing the

shown that asymptotic stability of many global RBF-QFs is independent of

present work also demonstrates that there are still many gaps to fill in future

for both exploration and testing can lead to massive selection bias, leading to
many false discoveries. Selective inference is a framework that allows for
performing valid inference even when the same data is reused for exploration

inference for data clustering, where a clustering procedure is used to
hypothesize a separation of the data points into a collection of subgroups, and
we then wish to test whether these data-dependent clusters in fact represent
meaningful differences within the data. Recent work by Gao et al. [2022]
provides a framework for doing selective inference for this setting, where the
hierarchical clustering algorithm is used for producing the cluster
assignments, which was then extended to k-means clustering by Chen and Witten

data, but in practice, the noise level needs to be estimated-and this is
particularly challenging when the true cluster structure is unknown. In our
work, we extend to the setting of noise with unknown variance, and provide a
selective inference method for this more general setting. Empirical results
show that our new method is better able to maintain high power while
controlling Type I error when the true noise level is unknown.

needs to be minimized in the design of aircraft engines. Indirect noise is
caused by the acceleration of flow inhomogeneities through a nozzle.
High-fidelity simulations showed that some flow inhomogeneities can be
chemically reacting when they leave the combustor and enter the nozzle (Giusti
et al., 2019). The state-of-art models, however, are limited to chemically
non-reacting (frozen) flows. In this work, first, we propose a low-order model
to predict indirect noise in nozzle flows with reacting inhomogeneities.
Second, we identify the physical sources of sound, which generate indirect
noise via two physical mechanisms: (i) chemical reaction generates
compositional perturbations, thereby adding to compositional noise; and (ii)
exothermic reaction generates entropy perturbations. Third, we numerically
compute the nozzle transfer functions for different frequency ranges (Helmholtz
numbers) and reaction rates (Damk\""{o}hler numbers) in subsonic flows with
hydrogen and methane inhomogeneities. Fourth, we extend the model to supersonic
flows. We find that hydrogen inhomogeneities have a larger impact to indirect
noise than methane inhomogeneities. Both the Damk\""{o}hler number and the
Helmholtz number markedly influence the phase and magnitude of the transmitted

stability. This work provides a physics-based low-order model, which can open

can change the fibrillar behavior in various ways. Advanced-Glycation
Endproducts (AGEs), one particular type of cross-links, have been shown to
accumulate and impair the mechanical properties of collageneous tissues,
whereas enzymatic cross-links (ECLs) are known for stabilizing the structure of
the fibril. However, the reasons for whether a given type of cross-link
improves or impairs the material properties remain unknown. Here, we use
coarse-grained steered molecular models to evaluate the effect of AGEs and ECLs
cross-links content on the deformation and failure properties of collagen
fibrils. Our simulations show that the collagen fibrils stiffen at high strain
levels when the AGEs content exceeds a critical value. In addition, the
strength of the fibril increases with AGEs accumulation. By analyzing the
forces within the different types of cross-links (AGEs and ECLs) as well as
their failure, we demonstrate that a change of deformation mechanism is at the
origin of these observations. A high AGEs content reinforces force transfer
through AGEs cross-links rather than through friction between sliding
tropocollagen molecules. We show that this failure mechanism, which is
associated with lower energy dissipation, results in more abrupt failure of the
collagen fibril. Our results provide a direct and causal link between increased
AGEs content, inhibited intra-fibrillar sliding, increased stiffness, and
abrupt fibril fracture. Therefore, they explain the mechanical origin of bone
brittleness as commonly observed in elderly and diabetic populations. Our
findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying
impaired tissue behaviour due to elevated AGEs content and could enable
targeted measures regarding the reduction of specific collagen cross-linking
levels.

von Neumann entropy of quantum matter, we construct an emergent spacetime by
the virtue of the geometric language of statistical information manifolds. We
discuss the link between Wald--Jacobson approaches of thermodynamic/gravity
correspondence and Fisher pseudo-Riemannian metric of information manifold. We
derive in detail Einstein's field equations in statistical information
geometric forms. This results in finding a quantum origin of a positive
cosmological constant that is founded on Fisher metric. This cosmological
constant resembles those found in Lovelock's theories in a de Sitter background
as a result of using the complex extension of spacetime and the Gaussian
exponential families of probability distributions, and we find a time varying
dynamical gravitational constant as a function of Fisher metric together with
the corresponding Ryu-Takayanagi formula of such system. Consequently, we
obtain a dynamical equation for the entropy in information manifold using
Liouville-von Neumann equation from the Hamiltonian of the system. This
Hamiltonian is suggested to be non-Hermitian, which corroborates the approaches
that relate non-unitary conformal field theories to information manifolds. This
provides some insights on resolving ""the problem of time"".

stream during real-time inference, which is urgently required when the test
distribution differs from the training distribution. Several efforts have been
devoted to improving adaptation performance. However, we find that two
unfavorable defects are concealed in the prevalent adaptation methodologies
like test-time batch normalization (BN) and self-learning. First, we reveal
that the normalization statistics in test-time BN are completely affected by
the currently received test samples, resulting in inaccurate estimates. Second,
we show that during test-time adaptation, the parameter update is biased
towards some dominant classes. In addition to the extensively studied test
stream with independent and class-balanced samples, we further observe that the
defects can be exacerbated in more complicated test environments, such as
(time) dependent or class-imbalanced data. We observe that previous approaches
work well in certain scenarios while show performance degradation in others due
to their faults. In this paper, we provide a plug-in solution called DELTA for
Degradation-freE fuLly Test-time Adaptation, which consists of two components:
(i) Test-time Batch Renormalization (TBR), introduced to improve the estimated
normalization statistics. (ii) Dynamic Online re-weighTing (DOT), designed to
address the class bias within optimization. We investigate various test-time
adaptation methods on three commonly used datasets with four scenarios, and a
newly introduced real-world dataset. DELTA can help them deal with all
scenarios simultaneously, leading to SOTA performance.

dexterous manipulation tasks with offline reinforcement learning (RL) or
imitation learning. To this end, participants are provided with datasets
containing dozens of hours of robotic data. For each task an expert and a mixed
dataset are provided. In our experiments, when learning from the expert
datasets, we find standard Behavioral Cloning (BC) outperforms state-of-the-art
offline RL algorithms. When learning from the mixed datasets, BC performs
poorly, as expected, while surprisingly offline RL performs suboptimally,
failing to match the average performance of the baseline model used for
collecting the datasets. To remedy this, motivated by the strong performance of
BC on the expert datasets we elect to use a semi-supervised classification
technique to filter the subset of expert data out from the mixed datasets, and
subsequently perform BC on this extracted subset of data. To further improve
results, in all settings we use a simple data augmentation method that exploits
the geometric symmetry of the RRC physical robotic environment. Our submitted
BC policies each surpass the mean return of their respective raw datasets, and
the policies trained on the filtered mixed datasets come close to matching the
performances of those trained on the expert datasets.

widely-used tool for advertisers to automatically make bids on different
impressions in real time. Instead of submitting bids for each single
impression, advertisers in auto-bidding submit their high-level objectives and
constraints to the auto-bidding tool, and observe the cumulative advertising
performances after all the auctions within a time period have been finished.
Motivated by the features of automated bidding, we aim to design auctions with
private financial constraints for value-maximizing bidders. Specifically, we
consider budget and ROI, the two most common financial constraints in online
advertising, as the private information of advertisers, and analyse the
conditions of truthfulness. We show that every non-decreasing function with
budget as input could be mapped to a truthful auction mechanism with budget and
ROI as input, but this mapping procedure also introduces complex value grouping
structures into mechanism design. To achieve feasible and implementable
auctions, we design a truthful auto-bidding auction mechanism with adjustable
rank score functions. As the key design to guarantee truthfulness, our auction
utilizes the bidder's budget constraint to compute a critical ROI, which
enables comparisons between the budget and ROI constraint. We conduct
experiments under different auto-bidding settings to validate the performance
of our proposed auction in terms of revenue and social welfare.

\Box_{\min}^{\max} x = b$ and using the $L_\infty$ norm, (Baaj, 2023) showed
that the Chebyshev distance $\Delta = \inf_{c \in \mathcal{C}} \Vert b - c
\Vert$, where $\mathcal{C}$ is the set of second members of consistent systems
defined with the same matrix $A$, can be computed by an explicit analytical
formula according to the components of the matrix $A$ and its second member
$b$. In this article, we give analytical formulas analogous to that of (Baaj,
2023) to compute the Chebyshev distance associated to the second member of a
system of $\max$-product fuzzy relational equations and that associated to the
second member of a system of $\max$-Lukasiewicz fuzzy relational equations.

  makers-like implementations","43 pages, UCL-CBT Report",,,"02","q-fin.GN cs.OH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  There is a persistent lack of funding, especially for SMEs, that cyclically
worsens. The factoring and invoice discounting market appears to address delays
in paying commercial invoices: sellers bring still-to-be-paid invoices to
financial organizations, intermediaries, typically banks that provide an
advance payment. This article contains research on novel decentralized
approaches to said lending services without intermediaries by using liquidity
pools and its associated heuristics, creating an Automated Market Maker. In our
approach, the contributed collateral and the invoice trades with risk is
measured with a formula: The Kelly criterion is used to calculate the optimal
premium to be contributed to a liquidity pool in the funding of the said
invoices. The behavior of the algorithm is studied in several scenarios of
streams of invoices with representative amounts, collaterals, payment delays,
and nonpayments rates or mora. We completed the study with hack scenarios with
bogus, nonpayable invoices. As a result, we have created a resilient solution
that performs the best with partially collateralized invoices. The outcome is
decentralized market developed with the Kelly criterion that is reasonably
resilient to a wide variety of the invoicing cases that provides sound profit
to liquidity providers, and several premium distribution policies were checked
that contributed with extra resilience to the performance of the algorithm.

As a new approach, we drive the optimality conditions in the form of Pontryagin

polycrystalline Kxp-terphenyl samples with nominal $x=3$, for which signatures
of high-temperature superconductivity were previously reported. The infrared
spectra are dominated by two Lorentzian bands with maxima around 4 000
cm$^{-1}$ and 12 000 cm$^{-1}$ which, from a comparison with calculations based
on a H\""uckel model are assigned to intra-molecular excitations of $\pi$
electrons of the anionic p-terphenyl molecules. The inter-molecular electronic
excitations are much weaker and give rise to a Drude peak and a similarly weak
Lorentzian band around 220 cm$^{-1}$. A dc resistivity of about 0.3 $\Omega$ cm
at 300 K is deduced from the IR data, comparable to values measured by
electrical resistivity on a twin sample. The analysis of the temperature
dependence of the low-frequency response reveals a gradual decrease of the
plasma frequency and the scattering rate of the Drude peak below 300 K that
gets anomalously enhanced below 90 K. The corresponding missing spectral weight
of the Drude peak appears blue-shifted towards the Lorentz-band at 220
cm$^{-1}$. This characteristic blue-shift signifies an enhanced localization of
the charge carriers at low temperatures and contrasts the behavior expected for
a bulk superconducting state for which the missing spectral weight would be
redshifted to a delta-function at zero frequency that accounts for the
loss-free response of the superconducting condensate. Our data might still be
compatible with a filamentary superconducting state with a volume fraction well
below the percolation limit for which the spatial confinement of the condensate
can result in a plasmonic resonance at finite frequency.

a notion of formal infinite linear combination in the likes of the formal
infinite linear combinations one has in the context of generalized power
series, we call these \textit{categories of reasonable strong vector spaces}
(r.s.v.s.). We show that, in a precise sense, the more general possible
definition for a strong vector space is that of a small
$\mathrm{Vect}$-enriched endofunctor of $\mathrm{Vect}$ that is right
orthogonal, for every cardinal $\lambda$, to the cokernel of the canonical
inclusion of the $\lambda$-th copower in the $\lambda$-th power of the identity
functor: these form the objects for a universal r.s.v.s. we call
$\Sigma\mathrm{Vect}$. We relate this category to what could be understood to
be the obvious category of strong vector spaces $B\Sigma\mathrm{Vect}$ and to
the r.s.v.s. $K\mathrm{TVect}_s$ of separated linearly topologized spaces that
are generated by linearly compact spaces. We study the number of iterations of
the obvious approximate reflector on
$\mathrm{Ind}\text{-}(\mathrm{Vect}^{\mathrm{op}})$ needed to construct the
orthogonal reflector $\mathrm{Ind}\text{-}(\mathrm{Vect}^{\mathrm{op}}) \to
\Sigma\mathrm{Vect}$ as it relates to the problem of constructing the smallest
subspace of an $X \in \Sigma\mathrm{Vect}$ closed under taking infinite linear
combinations containing a given linear subspace of $H$ of $X$. Finally we show
the natural monoidal closed structure on
$\mathrm{Ind}\text{-}(\mathrm{Vect}^{\mathrm{op}})$ restricts naturally to
$\Sigma\mathrm{Vect}$ and apply this to define an infinite-sum-sensitive notion
of K\""ahler differentials for generalized power series. Most of the technical
results apply to a more general class of orthogonal subcategories of
$\mathrm{Ind}\text{-}(\mathrm{Vect}^{\mathrm{op}})$ and we work with that
generality.

distributing raw materials, semi-finished product goods, and final products;
Internet of Things (IoT) for connecting and exchanging data; utility networks
for transmitting fuel, power, water, electricity, and 4G/5G; and social
networks for sharing information and connections. The binary-state network is a
basic network, where the state of each component is either success or failure,
i.e., the binary-state. Network reliability plays an important role in
evaluating the performance of network planning, design, and management. Because
more networks are being set up in the real world currently, there is a need for
their reliability. It is necessary to build a reliable network within a limited
budget. However, existing studies are focused on the budget limit for each
minimal path (MP) in networks without considering the total budget of the
entire network. We propose a novel concept to consider how to build a more
reliable binary-state network under the budget limit. In addition, we propose
an algorithm based on the binary-addition-tree algorithm (BAT) and stepwise
vectors to solve the problem efficiently.

coupled to the scalar field. At the classical level, the Lagrangian is obtained
by null reducing the relativistic theory in one higher dimension. The resulting
theory is found to be invariant under infinite Galilean conformal symmetries.
Using Noether's procedure, we construct the corresponding infinite conserved
charges. Path integral techniques are then employed to probe the quantum
""properties"" of the theory. The theory is found to be renormalizable. A novel
feature of the theory is the emergence of mass scale at the first order of
quantum correction. The conformal symmetry of the theory breaks at the quantum
level. We confirm this by constructing the beta function of the theory.

  Angular Correlation Functions of CMB Anisotropy",,,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The exquisitely measured maps of fluctuations in the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) present the possibility to test the principle of Statistical
Isotropy (SI) of the Universe through systematic observable measures for
non-Statistical Isotropy (nSI) features in the data. Recent measurements of the
CMB temperature field provide tantalizing evidence of the deviation from SI. A
systematic approach based on strong mathematical formulation allows any nSI
feature to be traced to known physical effects or observational artefacts.
Unexplained nSI features could have immense cosmological ramifications for the
standard model of cosmology. BipoSH (Bipolar Spherical Harmonics) provides a
general formalism for quantifying the departure from statistical isotropy for a
field on a 2D sphere. We adopt a known reduction of the BipoSH functions,
dubbed Minimal Harmonics (Manakov et al. 1996). We demonstrate that this
reduction technique of BipoSH leads to a new generalized set of isotropic
angular correlation functions (mBipoSH) that are observable quantifications of
nSI features in a sky map. We show that any nSI feature in the CMB map captured
by BipoSH at the bipolar multiple $L$ with projection $M$ can be studied by
$(L+1)$ mBipoSH angular correlation functions in case of even parity and by $L$
functions in case of odd parity. We present in this letter a novel observable
quantification of deviation from statistical isotropy in terms of generalized
angular correlation functions that are compact and complementary to the BipoSH
spectra that generalize angular power spectrum CMB fluctuations.

  coarse-graining of molecular dynamics data with fractures",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Molecular dynamics (MD) has served as a powerful tool for designing materials
with reduced reliance on laboratory testing. However, the use of MD directly to
treat the deformation and failure of materials at the mesoscale is still
largely beyond reach. Herein, we propose a learning framework to extract a
peridynamic model as a mesoscale continuum surrogate from MD simulated material
fracture datasets. Firstly, we develop a novel coarse-graining method, to
automatically handle the material fracture and its corresponding
discontinuities in MD displacement dataset. Inspired by the Weighted
Essentially Non-Oscillatory scheme, the key idea lies at an adaptive procedure
to automatically choose the locally smoothest stencil, then reconstruct the
coarse-grained material displacement field as piecewise smooth solutions
containing discontinuities. Then, based on the coarse-grained MD data, a
two-phase optimization-based learning approach is proposed to infer the optimal
peridynamics model with damage criterion. In the first phase, we identify the
optimal nonlocal kernel function from datasets without material damage, to
capture the material stiffness properties. Then, in the second phase, the
material damage criterion is learnt as a smoothed step function from the data
with fractures. As a result, a peridynamics surrogate is obtained. Our
peridynamics surrogate model can be employed in further prediction tasks with
different grid resolutions from training, and hence allows for substantial
reductions in computational cost compared with MD. We illustrate the efficacy
of the proposed approach with several numerical tests for single layer
graphene. Our tests show that the proposed data-driven model is robust and
generalizable: it is capable in modeling the initialization and growth of
fractures under discretization and loading settings that are different from the
ones used during training.

Transformers to better leverage the inductive bias about 3D geometric

crystalline arrangements, local concentrations of BC are generally linked to
single-particle wavefunctions that are a quantum superposition of electron and

two-dimensional systems with pairs of massive Dirac cones and three-dimensional
bulk crystals with quartets of Weyl cones. Here, we demonstrate that in
materials equipped with orbital degrees of freedom local BC concentrations can
arise even in the complete absence of hole excitations. In these solids, the
crystals fields appearing in very low-symmetric structures trigger BCs

naturally yield giant BC dipoles and large non-linear transport responses in

four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime to a broader framework that identifies an
event not only in space and in time, but also in terms of possible world, with
a third category of coordinates called ``hap'' modelling contingency and
counterfactuals. Semantically, hap is based on a Bohmian-like configuration
space, in which initial conditions at a specific moment in time uniquely
identify a trajectory. This framework can be used to support reasonings that
rigorously distinguish between causal dependencies (through time), statistical
dependencies (through space) and counterfactual dependencies (through hap). As
an example, we use this framework to show that the assumption of free choice is
not absolute, but rather depends on the chosen frame of reference: while Alice
may see a choice made freely, which is formally a unilateral, single-coordinate
translation in hap, Bob sitting in another reference frame might see this same
choice not made freely and observe instead a translation in hap jointly across
multiple coordinates, which indicates a counterfactual dependency. The
framework is agnostic regarding which flavour of the De-Broglie-Bohm theory is
considered, as it only makes general assumptions on the set of trajectories
that are commonly accepted in the Bohmian mechanics community. It is also
general enough to support reasoning on theories for which the separation
between possible worlds might also depend on the frame of reference, i.e., two
observers might disagree on whether two spacetimehap events happen in the same
world or not.

applies a novel strategy to detect the presence of poisoned clusters. The
proposed strategy is based on a general misclassification behaviour obtained
when the features of a representative example of the analysed cluster are added
to benign samples. The capability of inducing a misclassification error is a
general characteristic of poisoned samples, hence the proposed defence is
attack-agnostic. This mask a significant difference with respect to existing
defences, that, either can defend against only some types of backdoor attacks,
e.g., when the attacker corrupts the label of the poisoned samples, or are
effective only when some conditions on the poisoning ratios adopted by the
attacker or the kind of triggering pattern used by the attacker are satisfied.
Experiments carried out on several classification tasks, considering different
types of backdoor attacks and triggering patterns, including both local and
global triggers, reveal that the proposed method is very effective to defend
against backdoor attacks in all the cases, always outperforming the state of

  Processing","To appear in CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.CV cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-supervised learning in vision-language processing exploits semantic
alignment between imaging and text modalities. Prior work in biomedical VLP has
mostly relied on the alignment of single image and report pairs even though
clinical notes commonly refer to prior images. This does not only introduce
poor alignment between the modalities but also a missed opportunity to exploit
rich self-supervision through existing temporal content in the data. In this
work, we explicitly account for prior images and reports when available during
both training and fine-tuning. Our approach, named BioViL-T, uses a
CNN-Transformer hybrid multi-image encoder trained jointly with a text model.
It is designed to be versatile to arising challenges such as pose variations
and missing input images across time. The resulting model excels on downstream
tasks both in single- and multi-image setups, achieving state-of-the-art
performance on (I) progression classification, (II) phrase grounding, and (III)
report generation, whilst offering consistent improvements on disease
classification and sentence-similarity tasks. We release a novel multi-modal
temporal benchmark dataset, MS-CXR-T, to quantify the quality of
vision-language representations in terms of temporal semantics. Our
experimental results show the advantages of incorporating prior images and
reports to make most use of the data.

methods, which obtain solutions to complex problems, based on the numerical
solution of PDE. Other methods are also reviewed, which are developed around
some of the properties presented by the solution, that is, methods of heuristic

that the solution of the Eikonal equation for burnback analysis is undertaken
in the early 2000, clarifying the problem. Finally, several examples of the

data-driven model reduction methods for dynamical systems, including the
Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), the Hankel alternative view of the Koopman
decomposition (HAVOK), nearest-neighbor predictions and the reduction to
spectral submanifolds (SSMs). In developing these applications, multiple
authors have observed that delay embedding appears to separate the data into
modes, whose orientations depend only on the spectrum of the sampled system. In
this work, we make this observation precise by proving that the eigenvectors of
the delay-embedded linearized system at a fixed point are determined solely by
the corresponding eigenvalues, even for multi-dimensional observables. This
implies that the tangent space of a delay-embedded invariant manifold can be
predicted a priori using an estimate of the eigenvalues. We apply our results
to three datasets to identify multimodal SSMs and analyse their nonlinear modal
interactions. While SSMs are the focus of our study, these results generalize
to any delay-embedded invariant manifold tangent to a set of eigenvectors at a
fixed point. Therefore, we expect this theory to be applicable to a number of
data-driven model reduction methods.

Lagrangian's exact gauge symmetry. It requires the existence of the mass gap in
the Yang-Mills theory, after the corresponding non-perturbative renormalization

not affected for the regularized gluon fields. All this made it possible to
formulate a novel non-perturbative analytical approach to QCD and its ground
state, reflecting these complexities. The dimensional regularization method's
prescription to remove quadratically divergent terms in the perturbation theory
has been put on a firm mathematical ground within our formalism. It is proven
that these terms have to be eliminated in the non-perturbation theory as well

indirectly impact downstream packages, but the impact of breaking changes and
how dependent packages recover from these breaking changes remain unclear. To
close this gap, we investigated the manifestation of breaking changes in the
npm ecosystem, focusing on cases where packages' builds are impacted by
breaking changes from their dependencies. We measured the extent to which
breaking changes affect dependent packages. Our analyses show that around 12%
of the dependent packages and 14% of their releases were impacted by a breaking
change during updates of non-major releases of their dependencies. We observed
that, from all of the manifesting breaking changes, 44% were introduced both in

the setting of unknown patient heterogeneity in phase I cancer clinical trials

offers a two-in-one approach to dose-finding by simultaneously selecting
patient criteria that differentiate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and
recommending the subpopulation-specific MTD if needed, using marginal models to
sequentially incorporate patient covariates. Our simulation study compares the

theory, we develop a method to quantify technological sophistication. Our
approach explicitly addresses the transformative process where inputs interact
to generate outputs; providing a more direct inference about the nature of
technology. More specifically, we measure the degree to which an industry's
inputs interact in a synergistic fashion. Synergies create novel outputs, so we
conjecture that synergistic technologies are more sophisticated. We test this
conjecture by estimating synergy scores for industries across nearly 150
countries using input-output datasets. We find that these scores predict
popular export-based measures of economic complexity that are commonly used as
proxies for economic sophistication. The method yields synergistic interaction
networks that provide further insights on the structure of industrial

tend to be disassortative sector-wise. To the extent of our knowledge, our

  Remote Sensing Imagery",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Building 3D reconstruction from remote sensing images has a wide range of
applications in smart cities, photogrammetry and other fields. Methods for
automatic 3D urban building modeling typically employ multi-view images as
input to algorithms to recover point clouds and 3D models of buildings.
However, such models rely heavily on multi-view images of buildings, which are
time-intensive and limit the applicability and practicality of the models. To
solve these issues, we focus on designing an efficient DSM estimation-driven
reconstruction framework (Building3D), which aims to reconstruct 3D building
models from the input single-view remote sensing image. First, we propose a
Semantic Flow Field-guided DSM Estimation (SFFDE) network, which utilizes the
proposed concept of elevation semantic flow to achieve the registration of
local and global features. Specifically, in order to make the network semantics
globally aware, we propose an Elevation Semantic Globalization (ESG) module to
realize the semantic globalization of instances. Further, in order to alleviate
the semantic span of global features and original local features, we propose a
Local-to-Global Elevation Semantic Registration (L2G-ESR) module based on
elevation semantic flow. Our Building3D is rooted in the SFFDE network for
building elevation prediction, synchronized with a building extraction network
for building masks, and then sequentially performs point cloud reconstruction,
surface reconstruction (or CityGML model reconstruction). On this basis, our
Building3D can optionally generate CityGML models or surface mesh models of the
buildings. Extensive experiments on ISPRS Vaihingen and DFC2019 datasets on the
DSM estimation task show that our SFFDE significantly improves upon
state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, our Building3D achieves impressive results in
the 3D point cloud and 3D model reconstruction process.

arriving sequentially, where each task is defined using a few-shot episode of

generates specialized task-specific CNN weights directly from the support set.
In order to learn from a continual sequence of tasks, we propose to recursively
re-use the generated weights as input to the HT for the next task. This way,
the generated CNN weights themselves act as a representation of previously

from most continual learning algorithms that typically rely on using replay

is significantly stronger than standard astrophysical predictions. One possible
explanation is an early radio excess above the cosmic microwave background.
Such a radio background could have been produced by high redshift galaxies, if
they were especially efficient in producing low-frequency synchrotron
radiation. We have previously studied the effects of such an inhomogeneous
radio background on the 21-cm signal; however, we made a simplifying assumption
of isotropy of the background seen by each hydrogen cloud. Here we perform a
complete calculation that accounts for the fact that the 21-cm absorption
occurs along the line of sight, and is therefore sensitive to radio sources
lying behind each absorbing cloud. We find that the complete calculation
strongly enhances the 21-cm power spectrum during cosmic dawn, by up to two
orders of magnitude; on the other hand, the effect on the global 21-cm signal
is only at the $5\%$ level. In addition to making the high-redshift 21-cm
fluctuations potentially more easily observable, the line of sight radio effect
induces a new anisotropy in the 21-cm power spectrum. While these effects are
particularly large for the case of an extremely-enhanced radio efficiency, they
make it more feasible to detect even a moderately-enhanced radio efficiency in
early galaxies. This is especially relevant since the EDGES signal has been
contested by the SARAS experiment.

than those predicted by impulsively-driven, one-dimensional flare loop models.
This discrepancy is most apparent during the gradual phase, where emission from
these models decays over minutes, in contrast to the hour or more often
observed. Magnetic reconnection is invoked as the energy source of a flare, but
should deposit energy into a given loop within a matter of seconds. Models
which supplement this impulsive energization with a long, persistent ad hoc
heating have successfully reproduced long-duration emission, but without
providing a clear physical justification. Here we propose a model for extended
flare heating by the slow dissipation of turbulent Alfv\'en waves initiated
during the retraction of newly-reconnected flux tubes through a current sheet.
Using one-dimensional simulations, we track the production and evolution of MHD
wave turbulence trapped by reflection from high-density gradients in the
transition region. Turbulent energy dissipates through non-linear interaction
between counter-propagating waves, modeled here using a phenomenological
one-point closure model. AIA EUV light curves synthesized from the simulation
were able to reproduce emission decay on the order of tens of minutes. We find
this simple model offers a possible mechanism for generating the extended
heating demanded by observed coronal flare emissions self-consistently from
reconnection-powered flare energy release.

remains between 30 to 35 K for pressures up to 2 GPa. A second
antiferromagnetic phase (AFM2) is observed at higher pressures. The transition
from the paramagnetic to the AFM2 phase is of second-order nature and appears
to be connected to the structural transition. The magnetic volume fraction

similar low-temperature muon-precession frequencies in AFM1 and AFM2 phases

To mitigate the gap, this paper proposes a novel trainable Padding Module that

without requiring or influencing the model's entire loss function. To train
itself, the Padding Module constructs a ground truth and a predictor from the

pixels to the border of its input images or feature maps. The padding contents
are realistic extensions to its input data and simultaneously facilitate the

use of a physics-guided loss function for the optimization of the deep learning

augmented with a mass conservation law in the lost function to prevent the
generation of physically inconsistent results. The deep learning model is
trained on a set of FEM datasets that are generated from a commercially
available state-of-the-art numerical neurosurgery simulator. The use of the
physics-guided loss function in a deep learning model has led to a better
generalization in the prediction of deformations in unseen simulation cases.
Moreover, the proposed method achieves a better accuracy over the conventional
CNN models, where improvements were observed in unseen tissue from 8% to 30%

scattering events. The distribution of energies for neutrino events must
instead be inferred from the responses of a sum of dissimilar event topologies.
For this reason, precise neutrino cross sections on nucleon targets are of
vital importance to the neutrino oscillation experimental program. On the other
hand, the necessary experimental data for neutrino scattering with elementary
targets are scarce because of the weak interaction cross section, which leads
to poorly-constrained nucleon and nuclear cross sections. Lattice QCD is
uniquely positioned to provide the requisite nucleon amplitudes needed to

Observations of scattering and/or emission of dust in a location of the disk
often lead to degenerate information about the kind of particles, such as size,
porosity, or fractal dimension of aggregates. Progress can be made by deriving
the full (polarizing) scattering phase function of such particles at multiple
wavelengths. This has now become possible by careful extraction from scattered
light images. Such an extraction requires knowledge about the shape of the
scattering surface in the disk and we discuss how to obtain such knowledge as
well as the associated uncertainties. We use a sample of disk images from
observations with VLT/SPHERE to, for the first time, extract the phase
functions of a whole sample of disks with broad phase angle coverage. We find
that polarized phase functions come in two categories. Comparing the extracted
functions with theoretical predictions from rigorous T-Matrix computations of
aggregates, we show that one category can be linked back to fractal, porous
aggregates, while the other is consistent with more compact, less porous
aggregates. We speculate that the more compact particles become visible in

embody the relevant physical properties. Here we focus on spins with local
interactions, whose correlations are extremely well captured by tensor network
states. Adopting an operational perspective, we define ensembles of random
tensor network states in one and two spatial dimensions that admit a sequential

ensemble explores the entire family of matrix product states, while in two
spatial dimensions, it corresponds to random isometric tensor network states.

results, we then deduce the typical case for measures of correlation such as
the von Neumann mutual information and a measure arising from the

observe the consistent emergence of a correlation length that only depends on

increasing the bond dimension leads to a higher correlation length in one

feature extraction for image classification by enabling weight sharing across
input channels. Recent works make it possible to improve representational
capabilities by using hypercomplex-inspired networks which consume high
computational costs. This paper reduces this cost by factorizing a quaternion
2D convolutional module into two consecutive vectormap 1D convolutional
modules. Also, we use 5D parameterized hypercomplex multiplication based fully
connected layers. Incorporating both yields our proposed hypercomplex network,
a novel architecture that can be assembled to construct deep axial-hypercomplex
networks (DANs) for image classifications. We conduct experiments on CIFAR
benchmarks, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet datasets and achieve better performance
with fewer trainable parameters and FLOPS. Our proposed model achieves almost
2% higher performance for CIFAR and SVHN datasets, and more than 3% for the
ImageNet-Tiny dataset and takes six times fewer parameters than the real-valued
ResNets. Also, it shows state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR benchmarks in
hypercomplex space.

longer distances per day than what has currently been performed. Further, some
of these proposed missions require autonomous driving and absolute localization
in darkness. For example, the Endurance A mission proposes to drive 1200km of
its total traverse at night. The lack of natural light available during such
missions limits what can be used as visual landmarks and the range at which
landmarks can be observed. In order for planetary rovers to traverse long
ranges, onboard absolute localization is critical to the ability of the rover
to maintain its planned trajectory and avoid known hazardous regions.
Currently, to accomplish absolute localization, a ground in the loop (GITL)
operation is performed wherein a human operator matches local maps or images
from onboard with orbital images and maps. This GITL operation limits the
distance that can be driven in a day to a few hundred meters, which is the
distance that the rover can maintain acceptable localization error via relative
methods. Previous work has shown that using craters as landmarks is a promising
approach for performing absolute localization on the moon during the day. In
this work we present a method of absolute localization that utilizes craters as
landmarks and matches detected crater edges on the surface with known craters
in orbital maps. We focus on a localization method based on a perception system
which has an external illuminator and a stereo camera. We evaluate (1) both
monocular and stereo based surface crater edge detection techniques, (2)
methods of scoring the crater edge matches for optimal localization, and (3)
localization performance on simulated Lunar surface imagery at night. We
demonstrate that this technique shows promise for maintaining absolute

on top of a diluted over-luminous Type Ia spectrum. In the only previous
systematic study of this class (Silverman et al. 2013), 16 objects were
identified, 8 historic and 8 from the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF). Now
using the successor survey to PTF, the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), we have
classified 12 additional objects of this type through the systematic Bright
Transient Survey (BTS). In this study, we present and analyze the optical and
mid-IR light curves, optical spectra, and host galaxy properties of this
sample. Consistent with previous studies, we find the objects to have slowly
evolving light curves compared to normal SNe Ia with peak absolute magnitudes
between -19.1 and -21, spectra having weak H$\beta$, large Balmer decrements of
~7 and strong Ca NIR emission. Out of 10 SNe from our sample observed by
NEOWISE, 9 have $3\sigma$ detections, along with some showing a clear reduction
in red-wing of H$\alpha$, indicative of newly formed dust. We do not find our
SN Ia-CSM sample to have a significantly different distribution of equivalent
width of He I $\lambda5876$ than SNe IIn as observed in Silverman et al. 2013.

of a flow in state space are expected to collapse onto a manifold whose
dimension may be much lower than the dimension required for a resolved
simulation. On this manifold, the state of the system can be exactly described
in a coordinate system parameterizing the manifold. Describing the system in
this low-dimensional coordinate system allows for much faster simulations and
analysis. We show, for turbulent Couette flow, that this description of the
dynamics is possible using a data-driven manifold dynamics modeling method.
This approach consists of an autoencoder to find a low-dimensional manifold
coordinate system and a set of ordinary differential equations defined by a
neural network. Specifically, we apply this method to minimal flow unit
turbulent plane Couette flow at $\textit{Re}=400$, where a fully resolved
solutions requires $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ degrees of freedom. Using only data from
this simulation we build models with fewer than $20$ degrees of freedom that
quantitatively capture key characteristics of the flow, including the streak
breakdown and regeneration cycle. At short-times, the models track the true
trajectory for multiple Lyapunov times, and, at long-times, the models capture
the Reynolds stress and the energy balance. For comparison, we show that the
models outperform POD-Galerkin models with $\sim$2000 degrees of freedom.
Finally, we compute unstable periodic orbits from the models. Many of these
closely resemble previously computed orbits for the full system; additionally,
we find nine orbits that correspond to previously unknown solutions in the full

converters are used. To address these two challenges, we consider a Bussgang
linear minimum mean square error (BLMMSE)-based channel estimator for large
scale massive MIMO systems with one-bit quantizers and a spatially
non-stationary channel. Whereas other works usually assume that the channel
covariance is known at the base station, we consider a plug-in BLMMSE estimator
that uses an estimate of the channel covariance and rigorously analyze the
distortion produced by using an estimated, rather than the true, covariance. To
cope with the spatial non-stationarity, we introduce dithering into the
quantized signals and provide a theoretical error analysis. In addition, we
propose an angular domain fitting procedure which is based on solving an
instance of non-negative least squares. For the multi-user data transmission
phase, we further propose a BLMMSE-based receiver to handle one-bit quantized

over the last two decades, leading to the development of a significant number
of datasets. Despite its benefits, having access to a large volume of corpora
makes it difficult when it comes to benchmark TIE systems. On the one hand,
different datasets have different annotation schemes, thus hindering the
comparison between competitors across different corpora. On the other hand, the
fact that each corpus is commonly disseminated in a different format requires a
considerable engineering effort for a researcher/practitioner to develop
parsers for all of them. This constraint forces researchers to select a limited
amount of datasets to evaluate their systems which consequently limits the
comparability of the systems. Yet another obstacle that hinders the
comparability of the TIE systems is the evaluation metric employed. While most
research works adopt traditional metrics such as precision, recall, and $F_1$,
a few others prefer temporal awareness -- a metric tailored to be more
comprehensive on the evaluation of temporal systems. Although the reason for
the absence of temporal awareness in the evaluation of most systems is not
clear, one of the factors that certainly weights this decision is the necessity
to implement the temporal closure algorithm in order to compute temporal
awareness, which is not straightforward to implement neither is currently
easily available. All in all, these problems have limited the fair comparison
between approaches and consequently, the development of temporal extraction
systems. To mitigate these problems, we have developed tieval, a Python library
that provides a concise interface for importing different corpora and
facilitates system evaluation. In this paper, we present the first public

observed around several middle-aged pulsars and referred to as ``TeV halos"".
Their formation mechanism remains under debate. It is also unknown whether they
are ubiquitous or related to certain subgroup of pulsars. With 2321 days of
observation, the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Gamma-Ray Observatory
detected VHE $\gamma$-ray emission at the location of the radio-quiet pulsar
PSR J0359+5414 with $>6\sigma$ significance. By performing likelihood tests
with different spectral and spatial models and comparing the TeV spectrum with
multi-wavelength observations of nearby sources, we show that this excess is
consistent with a TeV halo associated with PSR J0359+5414, though future
observation of HAWC and multi-wavelength follow-ups are needed to confirm this
nature. This new halo candidate is located in a non-crowded region in the outer
Galaxy. It shares similar properties to the other halos but its pulsar is
younger and radio-quiet. Our observation implies that TeV halos could commonly
exist around pulsars and their formation does not depend on the configuration
of the pulsar magnetosphere.

  https://github.com/dongbo811/AFFormer",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Existing semantic segmentation works have been mainly focused on designing
effective decoders; however, the computational load introduced by the overall
structure has long been ignored, which hinders their applications on
resource-constrained hardwares. In this paper, we propose a head-free
lightweight architecture specifically for semantic segmentation, named Adaptive
Frequency Transformer. It adopts a parallel architecture to leverage prototype
representations as specific learnable local descriptions which replaces the
decoder and preserves the rich image semantics on high-resolution features.
Although removing the decoder compresses most of the computation, the accuracy
of the parallel structure is still limited by low computational resources.
Therefore, we employ heterogeneous operators (CNN and Vision Transformer) for
pixel embedding and prototype representations to further save computational
costs. Moreover, it is very difficult to linearize the complexity of the vision
Transformer from the perspective of spatial domain. Due to the fact that
semantic segmentation is very sensitive to frequency information, we construct
a lightweight prototype learning block with adaptive frequency filter of
complexity $O(n)$ to replace standard self attention with $O(n^{2})$. Extensive
experiments on widely adopted datasets demonstrate that our model achieves
superior accuracy while retaining only 3M parameters. On the ADE20K dataset,
our model achieves 41.8 mIoU and 4.6 GFLOPs, which is 4.4 mIoU higher than
Segformer, with 45% less GFLOPs. On the Cityscapes dataset, our model achieves
78.7 mIoU and 34.4 GFLOPs, which is 2.5 mIoU higher than Segformer with 72.5%

In this work, we show that this feature can be explained by a simple toy model

'geometry-free' approaches where multi-view images are encoded as a (global)
set-latent representation, which is then used to predict the color for
arbitrary query rays. While this representation yields (coarsely) accurate
images corresponding to novel viewpoints, the lack of geometric reasoning
limits the quality of these outputs. To overcome this limitation, we propose
'Geometry-biased Transformers' (GBTs) that incorporate geometric inductive
biases in the set-latent representation-based inference to encourage multi-view
geometric consistency. We induce the geometric bias by augmenting the
dot-product attention mechanism to also incorporate 3D distances between rays
associated with tokens as a learnable bias. We find that this, along with
camera-aware embeddings as input, allows our models to generate significantly
more accurate outputs. We validate our approach on the real-world CO3D dataset,
where we train our system over 10 categories and evaluate its view-synthesis
ability for novel objects as well as unseen categories. We empirically validate
the benefits of the proposed geometric biases and show that our approach

collisions with the boundary. In chaos theory these systems are simple
prototypes, their conservative dynamics of a billiard may vary from regular to
chaotic, depending only on the border. The results reported here seek to shed
light on the quantization of classically chaotic systems. We present numerical
results on classical and quantum properties in two bi-parametric families of
Billiards, Elliptical Stadium Billiard (ESB) and Elliptical-$C_3$ Billiards
(E-$C_3$B). Both are elliptical perturbations of chaotic billiards with
originally circular sectors on their borders. Our numerical calculations show
evidence that the elliptical families can present a mixed classical phase
space, identified by a parameter $\rho_\text{c} < 1$, which we use to guide our
analysis of quantum spectra. We explored the short correlations through nearest
neighbor spacing distribution $p(s)$, which showed that in the mixed region of
the classical phase space, $p(s)$ is well described by the Berry-Robnik-Brody
(BRB) distributions for the ESB. In agreement with the expected from the
so-called ergodic parameter $\alpha = t_\text{H}/t_\text{T}$, the ratio between
the Heisenberg time and the classical diffusive-like transport time signals the
possibility of quantum dynamical localization when $\alpha < 1$. For the
E-$C_3$B family, the eigenstates can be split into singlets and doublets. BRB
describes $p(s)$ for singlets as the previous family in the mixed region.
However, the $p(s)$ for doublets are described by new distributions recently
introduced in the literature but only tested in a few cases for $\rho_\text{c}
< 1$. We observed that as $\rho_\text{c}$ decreases, the $p(s)$'s tend to move
away simultaneously from the GOE (singlets) and GUE (doublets) distributions.

We want to find the distribution of initial conditions that best
reproduces disc observations at the population level. Methods. We first ran a
parameter study using a 1D model that includes the viscous evolution of a gas
disc, dust, and pebbles, coupled with an emission model to compute the
millimetre flux observable with ALMA. This was used to train a machine learning
surrogate model that can compute the relevant quantity for comparison with
observations in seconds. This surrogate model was used to perform parameter
studies and synthetic disc populations. Results. Performing a parameter study,
we find that internal photoevaporation leads to a lower dependency of disc
lifetime on stellar mass than external photoevaporation. This dependence should
be investigated in the future. Performing population synthesis, we find that
under the combined losses of internal and external photoevaporation, discs are
too short lived. Conclusions. To match observational constraints, future models
of disc evolution need to include one or a combination of the following
processes: infall of material to replenish the discs, shielding of the disc
from internal photoevaporation due to magnetically driven disc winds, and
extinction of external high-energy radiation. Nevertheless, disc properties in
low-external-photoevaporation regions can be reproduced by having more massive
and compact discs. Here, the optimum values of the $\alpha$ viscosity parameter
lie between $3\times10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$ and with internal photoevaporation
being the main mode of disc dispersal.

twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), such as superconductivity, correlated gapped
and gapless phases, etc. The gapped phases are believed to be symmetry-breaking
states described by mean-field theories. Gapless phases, however, exhibit
exotic phenomena beyond naive mean-field descriptions. Such phenomena include
(i) zero-energy peaks in spectral density at low temperatures, (ii) a cascade
of transitions as that of a quantum dot at higher temperatures, (iii) the
Pomeranchuk effect where local moment develops upon heating, (iv) resistance
peaks in gapless phases at certain integer fillings, etc. These phenomena have
never been connected or explained on a microscopic level by any prior theory.
In this work, we point out that all these phenomena result from a simple
unified mechanism - the Kondo effect. We applied systematic analytical and
numerical renormalization group analyses to a single-impurity version of the
recently proposed topological heavy fermion (THF) model of MATBG. We find that
the Fermi liquid ground state exhibiting (i) zero-energy peaks is stabilized by
the Kondo screening effect. A higher temperature will drive the system into a
local moment phase that obeys Curie's law and has higher entropy. This explains
the (ii) transition cascade, (iii) the Pomeranchuk effect, and (iv) resistance
peaks. Remarkably, the computed spectral densities, entropies, and spin
susceptibilities are quantitatively comparable to experiments. Furthermore, we
predict that the ground state in a wide range of fractional fillings is the
heavy Fermi liquid, and compute its dispersion, quasi-particle weight, and
energy surfaces that could be used to verify our theory if compared to
experiments in the future studies. We conjecture that the heavy Fermi liquid is
the parent state of the observed unconventional superconductivity.

strength than for DAs and DBs. Finally we model the field structure of

detected statistically significant emission (>5 sigma) during one of the three

timescales of days to weeks. We also present an upper limit on the 10 GHz flux
density at pulsation phase phi=0.31 from an observation in 2014. We discuss
possible mechanisms that may produce the observed 15 GHz emission, but cannot
make a conclusive identification from the present data. The emission does not
appear to be consistent with originating from a close-in, late-type dwarf

X-ray observations have shown that delta Cephei undergoes periodic increases in
X-ray flux during pulsation phase phi~0.43. The lack of radio detection in two

the unbinned metallicity distribution function (MDF) of a stellar population to
estimate the mass spectrum of its progenitors. Our model makes use of the
well-known mass-metallicity relation of galaxies and assumes Gaussian MDF
distributions for individual progenitors: the overall MDF is thus a mixture of
MDFs from smaller galaxies. We apply the method to the stellar halo of the MW,
as well as the classical MW satellite galaxies. The stellar components of the
satellite galaxies have relatively small sample sizes, but we do not find any
evidence for accreted populations with L > L_host/100. We find that the MW
stellar halo has N~1-3 massive progenitors (L > 10^8 L_Sun) within 10 kpc, and
likely several hundred progenitors in total. We also test our method on
simulations of MW-mass haloes, and find that our method is able to recover the
true accreted population within a factor of two. Future datasets will provide
MDFs with orders of magnitude more stars, and this method could be a powerful
technique to quantify the accreted populations down to the ultra-faint dwarf

fully (though stochastically) characterised by an impulsive shock strength $B_*

Galactic halo because of the Sun's position. For a 100 GeV WIMP, Earth-mass
prompt cusps are predicted, and stellar encounters suppress their mean
annihilation luminosity by a factor of two already at 20 kpc, so that their
annihilation emission is predicted to appear almost uniform over the sky. The
Galactic Center $\gamma$-ray Excess is thus unaffected by cusps. If it is
indeed dark matter annihilation radiation, then prompt cusps in the outer

In addition, different forms of state preparation are investigated: analytic or

(or lack thereof) of the complexity near a phase transition depends on the
non-local character of the operations used to reach the ground state. For
Fubini-Study based complexity, we extract the universal properties and their
critical exponents. In practical algorithms, we find that the complexity
depends crucially on whether or not the system passes close to a quantum

difficult not to cross a critical point when the reference and target states
are in different phases, for VQE the algorithm can find a way to avoid

that may be segregated in the center of the young massive star cluster at
$z$=2.37 hosted in the lensed galaxy called {\tt Sunburst} galaxy. This result
is based on two pieces of evidence: (1) VLT/MUSE spectra of several multiple
images of the same star cluster show key spectral signatures of VMS, such as
the \heii\ broad emission, \nivblue\ emission, and an \niv\ P-Cygni profile. In
particular, \heii\ is broad ($\sim1610\pm300$ \kms), with an equivalent width
of 3\AA,\ and asymmetric profile. These features require an extremely young
($\sim2.5$ Myr) stellar population component in which the masses of the stars
exceed 100~\msun. When a Salpeter initial mass function and BPASS models for
normal massive stars are assumed, the observed spectral features require
$\sim$400 VMS. (2) The same star cluster is detected at a signal-to-noise ratio
of~$\sim100$ in the Lyman continuum domain ($\lambda < 900$\AA). The Lyman
continuum emission emerges from a region with a radius that is at least twice
smaller than what is observed at 1700\AA~(independently of magnification) and
is located in the center of the cluster. After delensing, the effective radii
in absolute scales are R$_{\tt eff}[{\tt LyC}]\sim4.7 \pm 1.5$ pc and R$_{\tt
eff}[1700]= 7.8 \pm 1.4$ pc. The Lyman continuum radiation is mainly produced
by hot and massive stars, which implies that their spatial distribution
(including that of VMS) is preferentially more confined in the central parts of
the cluster. Approximately 400 VMS hosted by a cluster of $\sim 10^7$ \msun\
produce $\sim$15\% of the escaping Lyman continuum photons, and the remaining
photons are produced by other massive early-type stars.

formulation to study the symmetric Kondo state in twisted bilayer graphene. Via
a large-N approximation, we find a symmetric Kondo (SK) state in KL mode at
fillings $\nu=0,\pm 1,\pm 2$. In the SK state, all symmetries are preserved and
the local moments are Kondo screened by the conduction electrons. At the
mean-field level of the THF model at $\nu=0,\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$, we also find
a similar symmetric state. We study the stability of the symmetric state by
comparing its energy with the ordered states and find the ordered states to
have lower energy. However, moving away from integer fillings by doping holes
to the light bands, we find the energy difference is reduced, which suggests
the loss of ordering and a tendency towards Kondo screening. In order to
include many-body effects beyond the mean-field approximation, we perform
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations on the THF model. We find the
spin susceptibility follows a Curie behavior at $\nu=0, \pm 1,\pm 2$ down to
$\sim 2\text{K}$ where the onset of screening of the local moment becomes
visible. This hints to very low Kondo temperatures at these fillings, in
agreement with the outcome of our mean-field calculations. At non-integer
filling $\nu=\pm 0.5,\pm 0.8,\pm 1.2$ DMFT shows deviations from a
$1/T$-susceptibility at much higher temperatures, suggesting a more effective
screening of local moments with doping. Finally, we study the effect of a
$C_{3z}$-rotational-symmetry-breaking strain via mean-field approaches and find
that a symmetric phase (that only breaks $C_{3z}$ symmetry) can be stabilized
at sufficiently large strain at $\nu=0,\pm 1, \pm 2$. Our results suggest that
a symmetric Kondo phase is strongly suppressed at integer fillings, but could
be stabilized either at non-integer fillings or by applying strain.

planets that encircle the same star tend to have similar masses and radii,
whereas those belonging to different systems exhibit remarkable overall
diversity. Here, we advance a theoretical picture for rocky planet formation
that satisfies the aforementioned constraints: building upon recent work -
which demonstrates that planetesimals can form rapidly at discrete locations in
the disk - we propose that super-Earths originate inside rings of silicate-rich
planetesimals at approximately ~1 AU. Within the context of this picture, we
show that planets grow primarily through pairwise collisions among rocky
planetesimals, until they achieve terminal masses that are regulated by
isolation and orbital migration. We quantify our model with numerical
simulations and demonstrate that our synthetic planetary systems bear a close
resemblance to compact, multi-resonant progenitors of the observed population
of short-period extrasolar planets. Our results thus indicate that the absence
of short-period super-Earths within the solar system can simply be attributed

  Materials and Methods: The joint k-TE reconstruction model was formulated as
an optimization problem subject to a self-consistency condition of the
exponential decay relationship between the T2W images and T2 map. The objective
function included a data fidelity term enforcing the agreement between the
solution and the measured k-space data, together with a spatial regularization
term on image properties of the T2W images. The optimization problem was solved
using Alternating-Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). We tested the joint
k-TE method in phantom data and healthy volunteer scans with fully-sampled and
under-sampled k-space lines. Image quality of the reconstructed T2W images and
T2 map, and the accuracy of T2 measurements derived by the joint k- TE and the
conventional signal fitting method were compared.
  Results: The proposed method improved image quality with reduced noise and
less artifacts on both T2W images and T2 map, and increased measurement
consistency in T2 relaxation time measurements compared with the conventional
method in all data sets.
  Conclusions: The proposed reconstruction method outperformed the conventional
magnitude image-based signal fitting method in image quality and stability of
quantitative T2 measurements

To
translate complex images with a wide range of objects to a different domain,
recent approaches often use the object annotations to perform per-class
source-to-target style mapping. However, there remains a point for us to
exploit in the I2I. An object in each class consists of multiple components,
and all the sub-object components have different characteristics. For example,
a car in CAR class consists of a car body, tires, windows and head and tail
lamps, etc., and they should be handled separately for realistic I2I
translation. The simplest solution to the problem will be to use more detailed
annotations with sub-object component annotations than the simple object
annotations, but it is not possible. The key idea of this paper is to bypass
the sub-object component annotations by leveraging the original style of the
input image because the original style will include the information about the
characteristics of the sub-object components. Specifically, for each pixel, we
use not only the per-class style gap between the source and target domains but
also the pixel's original style to determine the target style of a pixel. To
this end, we present Style Harmonization for unpaired I2I translation (SHUNIT).
Our SHUNIT generates a new style by harmonizing the target domain style
retrieved from a class memory and an original source image style. Instead of
direct source-to-target style mapping, we aim for source and target styles
harmonization. We validate our method with extensive experiments and achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the latest benchmark sets. The source code is

density and temperature structure, it is straightforward to construct the
corresponding differential emission measure profile $\xi(T)$, such that $\xi(T)
\, dT$ is proportional to the emissivity from plasma in the temperature range
$[T, T + dT]$. Here we study the inverse problem of obtaining a valid $\xi(T)$
profile from a set of EUV spectral line intensities observed at a pixel within
a solar image. Our goal is to introduce and develop a regularized maximum
likelihood (RML) algorithm designed to address the mathematically ill-posed
problem of constructing differential emission measure profiles from a discrete
set of EUV intensities in specified wavelength bands, specifically those
observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the NASA Solar Dynamics
Observatory. The RML method combines features of maximum likelihood and
regularized approaches used by other authors. It is also guaranteed to produce
a positive definite differential emission measure profile. We evaluate and
compare the effectiveness of the method against other published algorithms,
using both simulated data generated from parametric differential emission
profile forms, and AIA data from a solar eruptive event on 2010 November 3.
Similarities and differences between the differential emission measure profiles
and maps reconstructed by the various algorithms are discussed. The RML
inversion method is mathematically rigorous, computationally efficient, and
produces acceptable measures of performance in the following three key areas:
fidelity to the data, accuracy in the reconstruction, and robustness in the
presence of data noise. As such, it shows considerable promise for computing
differential emission measure profiles from datasets of discrete spectral
lines.

The massive deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, including sensors
and actuators, is ushering in smart and connected communities of the future.
The availability of real-time and high-quality sensor data is crucial for
various IoT applications, particularly in healthcare, energy, transportation,
etc. However, data collection may have to be outsourced to external service
providers (SPs) due to cost considerations or lack of specialized equipment.
Hence, the data market plays a critical role in such scenarios where SPs have
different quality levels of available data, and IoT users have different
application-specific data needs. The pairing between data available to the SP
and users in the data market requires an effective mechanism design that
considers the SPs' profitability and the quality-of-service (QoS) needs of the
users. We develop a generic framework to analyze and enable such interactions
efficiently, leveraging tools from contract theory and mechanism design theory.
It can enable and empower emerging data sharing paradigms such as
Sensing-as-a-Service (SaaS). The contract design creates a pricing structure
for on-demand sensing data for IoT users. By considering a continuum of user
types, we capture a diverse range of application requirements and propose
optimal pricing and allocation rules that ensure QoS provisioning and maximum
profitability for the SP. Furthermore, we provide analytical solutions for
fixed distributions of user types to analyze the developed approach. For
comparison, we consider the benchmark case assuming complete information of the
user types and obtain optimal contract solutions. Finally, a case study is
presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed contract design
framework.

the star's rotational axis and the companion's orbital plane ($\Delta i$). We
present results of a uniform analysis of rotation periods, stellar
inclinations, and obliquities of cool stars (SpT $\gtrsim$ F5) hosting directly
imaged planets and brown dwarf companions. As part of this effort, we have
acquired new $v \sin i_*$ values for 22 host stars with the high-resolution
Tull spectrograph at the Harlan J. Smith telescope. Altogether our sample
contains 62 host stars with rotation periods, most of which are newly measured
using light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Among these,
53 stars have inclinations determined from projected rotational and equatorial
velocities, and 21 stars predominantly hosting brown dwarfs have constraints on
$\Delta i$. Eleven of these (52$^{+10}_{-11}$% of the sample) are likely
misaligned, while the remaining ten host stars are consistent with spin-orbit
alignment. As an ensemble, the minimum obliquity distribution between 10-250 AU
is more consistent with a mixture of isotropic and aligned systems than either
extreme scenario alone--pointing to direct cloud collapse, formation within
disks bearing primordial alignments and misalignments, or architectures
processed by dynamical evolution. This contrasts with stars hosting directly
imaged planets, which show a preference for low obliquities. These results
reinforce an emerging distinction between the orbits of long-period brown
dwarfs and giant planets in terms of their stellar obliquities and orbital
eccentricities.

to account for the data. The spin-down models that lead to this inference are
essentially tuned to the sun. Here we take a different approach which considers
individual stars as fixed points rather than just the Sun. We use a
time-dependent theoretical model to solve for the spin evolution of low-mass
main-sequence stars that includes a Parker-type wind and a time-evolving
magnetic field coupled to the spin. Because the wind is exponentially sensitive
to the stellar mass over radius and the coronal base temperature, the use of
each observed star as a separate fixed point is more appropriate and, in turn,
produces a set of solution curves that produces a solution envelope rather than
a simple line. This envelope of solution curves, unlike a single line fit, is
consistent with the data and does not unambiguously require a modal transition
in the magnetic field to explain it.

out. (2) Two radial cuts at the ends of the tube and two longitudinal cuts to
lift the upper half of the tube and access the sample. Strategy 1 will likely
minimize contamination but incurs the risk of affecting the physical integrity
of weakly consolidated samples. Strategy 2 will be optimal for preserving the
physical integrity of the samples but increases the risk of contamination and
mishandling of the sample as more manipulations and additional equipment will
be needed. A flexible approach to opening the sample tubes is therefore
required, and several options need to be available, depending on the nature of
the rock samples returned. Both opening strategies 1 and 2 may need to be
available when the samples are returned to handle different sample types (e.g.,
loosely bound sediments vs. indurated magmatic rocks). This question should be
revisited after engineering tests are performed on analogue samples. The MSR
sample tubes will have to be opened under stringent BSL4 conditions and this

discretely with arrays of vertices and faces. However, 3D shapes in the real

continuous representation for meshes with fixed topology, a common and
practical setting in many faces-, hand-, and body-related applications. First,
we split the template into multiple closed manifold genus-0 meshes so that each
genus-0 mesh can be parameterized onto the unit sphere. Then we learn spherical
implicit surface (SIS), which takes a spherical coordinate and a global feature
or a set of local features around the coordinate as inputs, predicting the
vertex corresponding to the coordinate as an output. Since the spherical
coordinates are continuous, SIS can depict a mesh in an arbitrary resolution.
SIS representation builds a bridge between discrete and continuous
representation in 3D shapes. Specifically, we train SIS networks in a
self-supervised manner for two tasks: a reconstruction task and a
super-resolution task. Experiments show that our SIS representation is
comparable with state-of-the-art methods that are specifically designed for

resource-constrained project scheduling problem. Specifically, we first point
out a serious flaw in an existing start-end-event-based formulation owing to
inconsistent mode choices. We propose two options to formulate the missing
constraints and we consider an equivalent reformulation with sparser constraint
matrix. Second, we formulate an aggregate variant of an existing model that
relies on on-off-events and clarify the role of mode consistency issues in such
models. Third, we suggest two variants of an existing network flow formulation.
We enhance our models by adapting several techniques that have been used
previously, e.g., in cases with only a single mode. A large set of benchmark
instances from the literature provides the basis for an up-to-date and fair
computational study with an out-of-the-box solver package. We compare our
models against two models from the literature. Our experiments assert
confidently that network flow formulations prevail in the test bed, and they
provide a hint on why event-based models become less competitive in multi-mode
settings.

symmetric gauge theory, has properties that differ from those of the standard
toric code. Specifically, it features a blending of UV and IR in its ground
state, restricted mobility of its quasiparticles, and variations in the
braiding statistics of its quasiparticles based on their position. In this
paper, we investigate various aspects of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ rank-2 gauge theory in
${(2+1)}$-dimensional spacetime. Firstly, we demonstrate that $U(1)$ rank-2
gauge theory can arise from ${U(1)\times U(1)}$ rank-1 gauge theory after
condensing the gauge charges in a specific way. This construction scheme of
$U(1)$ rank-2 gauge theory carries over to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ case simply by
Higgsing $U(1)$ to $\mathbb{Z}_N$, after which the resulting rank-2 gauge
theory can be tuned to the R2TC. The holonomy operators of R2TC are readily
identified using this scheme and are given clear physical interpretation as the
pair creation/annihilation of various monopoles and dipoles. Explicit tensor
network construction of the ground states of R2TC are given as two copies of
the ground states of Kitaev's toric code that are `sewn together' according to
the condensation scheme. In addition, through a similar anyon condensation
protocol, we present a double semion version of rank-2 toric code whose flux
excitations exhibit restricted mobility and semionic statistics. Finally, we
identify the generalized discrete symmetries of the R2TC, which are much more
complex than typical 1-form symmetries. They include conventional and
unconventional 1-form symmetries, such as framed 1-form symmetries and what we
call sublattice 1-form symmetries. Using these, we interpret the R2TC's unique
properties (UV/IR mixing, position-dependent braiding, etc.) from the modern
perspective of generalized spontaneous symmetry breaking and 't Hooft
anomalies.

generalize causal abstraction to cyclic causal structures and typed high-level
variables. (2) We show how multi-source interchange interventions can be used
to conduct causal abstraction analyses. (3) We define a notion of approximate
causal abstraction that allows us to assess the degree to which a high-level
causal model is a causal abstraction of a lower-level one. (4) We prove
constructive causal abstraction can be decomposed into three operations we

  environments",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This article introduces an analytic formula for entraining convective
available potential energy (ECAPE) with an entrainment rate that is determined
directly from the storm environment. Extending previous formulas derived in
Peters et al. (2020), entrainment is connected to the background environment
via an analytic manipulation of the equations of motion that yields a direct
correspondence between the storm relative flow and the updraft radius, and an
inverse scaling between the updraft radius squared and entrainment rate. These
concepts, combined with the assumption of adiabatic conservation of moist
static energy, yield an explicit analytic equation for ECAPE that depends
entirely on state variables in an atmospheric profile and a few constant
parameters with values that are established in past literature. Using a
simplified Bernoulli-like equation, a second formula is derived that accounts
for updraft enhancement via kinetic energy extracted from the cloud's
background environment. CAPE and ECAPE can be viewed as predictors of the
maximum vertical velocity $w_{max}$ in an updraft. Hence, these formulas are
evaluated using $w_{max}$ from past numerical modeling studies. Both of the new
formulas improve predictions of $w_{max}$ substantially over undiluted CAPE,
ECAPE with a prescribed entrainment rate, and the ECAPE formula from Peters et
al. (2020). The formula that incorporates environmental kinetic energy
contribution to the updraft correctly predicts instances of exceedance of
$\sqrt{2\text{CAPE}}$ by $w_{max}$ in simulations, and provides a conceptual
explanation for why such exceedance is rare among past simulations. These
formulas are potentially useful in nowcasting and forecasting thunderstorms and
as thunderstorm proxies in climate change studies.

continuum polarization, p(cont), of 0.21+-0.09% at the first epoch. Between
days -11.5 to +05, p(cont) remained about 0 and by day +14.5 was again
significant at 0.19+-0.10%. Not considering the first epoch, the dominant axis
of SiII(6355A) was roughly constant, staying close to the continuum until both
rotated in opposite directions on day +14.5. Detailed radiation-hydrodynamical
simulations produce a very steep density slope in the outermost ejecta so that
the low first-epoch p(const) of about 0.2% nevertheless suggests a separate
structure with an axis ratio of about 2 in the outer carbon-rich 3...5E-3 Mo.
Large-amplitude fluctuations in the polarization profiles and a flocculent
appearance of the polar diagram for the CaII near-infrared triplet (NIR3) may
be related by a common origin. The temporal evolution of the polarization
spectra agrees with an off-center delayed detonation. The late-time increase in
polarization and the possible change in position angle are also consistent with
an aspherical 56Ni core. The p(cont) and the absorptions due to Si II(6355A)
and the CaII NIR3 form in the same region of the extended photosphere, with an
interplay between line occultation and thermalization producing p. Small-scale
polarization features may be due to small-scale structures, but many could be
related to atomic patterns of the quasi-continuum; the hardly have an
equivalent in the total-flux spectrum. We compare SN2019np to other SNe and

overcome Shannons channel capacity limit of existing communication systems by
providing ultrawide bandwidth signals. Mm-waves and THz are also able to build
wireless links compatible with optical communication systems. However, most
solid-state components that can operate reasonably efficiently at these
frequency ranges (100GHz-10THz), especially sources and detectors, require
cryogenic cooling, as is a requirement for most quantum systems. Here, we show
that secure mm-waves and THz QKD can be achieved when the sources and detectors
operate at cryogenic temperatures down to T= 4K. We compare single-input

Variable THz Quantum Key Distribution (CVQKD) schemes and find the positive
secret key rate in the frequency ranges between f=100 GHz and 1 THz. Moreover,

specific example of interpreting X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)
spectra. This method constructs a one-to-one mapping between individual
structure descriptors and spectral trends. Specifically, an adversarial
autoencoder is augmented with a novel rank constraint (RankAAE). The RankAAE
methodology produces a continuous and interpretable latent space, where each
dimension can track an individual structure descriptor. As a part of this
process, the model provides a robust and quantitative measure of the
structure-spectrum relationship by decoupling intertwined spectral
contributions from multiple structural characteristics. This makes it ideal for
spectral interpretation and the discovery of new descriptors. The capability of
this procedure is showcased by considering five local structure descriptors and
a database of over fifty thousand simulated XANES spectra across eight
first-row transition metal oxide families. The resulting structure-spectrum
relationships not only reproduce known trends in the literature, but also
reveal unintuitive ones that are visually indiscernible in large data sets. The
results suggest that the RankAAE methodology has great potential to assist
researchers to interpret complex scientific data, test physical hypotheses, and

IRAS~13224-3809, in a variety of similarly observed flux groups and explore the
model in all observations over a 16 year period. The model employs two X-ray
sources located along the black hole rotational axis at height, $h_1$ and $h_2$
respectively. These sources have their associated photon indices $\Gamma_1$ and
$\Gamma_2$ which respond to fluctuations in the disc with a maximum response
duration of $t_\text{max}$ and a propagation delay between the response of the
two of $t_\text{shift}$. We find that for 1H 0707-495, $h_2$ is significantly
correlated with $\Gamma_1$ and anti-correlated with ionisation $\xi$. Whilst
the 1H 0707-495 corona extends upwards, the emission appears softer and the
disc is less ionised. We find similarities in IRAS 13224-3809, but significant
anti-correlation between $\Gamma_2$ and both $t_\text{max}$ and
$t_\text{shift}$. This suggests that when the IRAS 13224-3809 corona becomes
softer while extending vertically upwards, the overall corona response occurs
faster. This may also suggest that the inner disc also becomes more active. In
addition, $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ are extreme, relatively less variable, but
more separate in IRAS 13224-3809 than in 1H 0707-495. This suggests that the
IRAS 13224-3809 corona may be more patchy in the sense that it has two more
clear distinct spectral zones of $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$ (possibly relating
to two distinct zones of coronal temperature) when compared to 1H 0707-495.

angiography (ICA) is important for automated assessment and report generation
of coronary artery stenosis in the computer-aided diagnosis of coronary artery
disease (CAD). Inspired by the training procedure of interventional
cardiologists for interpreting the structure of coronary arteries, we propose
an association graph-based graph matching network (AGMN) for coronary arterial
semantic labeling. We first extract the vascular tree from invasive coronary
angiography (ICA) and convert it into multiple individual graphs. Then, an
association graph is constructed from two individual graphs where each vertex
represents the relationship between two arterial segments. Using the
association graph, the AGMN extracts the vertex features by the embedding
module, aggregates the features from adjacent vertices and edges by graph
convolution network, and decodes the features to generate the semantic mappings
between arteries. By learning the mapping of arterial branches between two
individual graphs, the unlabeled arterial segments are classified by the
labeled segments to achieve semantic labeling. A dataset containing 263 ICAs
was employed to train and validate the proposed model, and a five-fold
cross-validation scheme was performed. Our AGMN model achieved an average
accuracy of 0.8264, an average precision of 0.8276, an average recall of
0.8264, and an average F1-score of 0.8262, which significantly outperformed
existing coronary artery semantic labeling methods. In conclusion, we have
developed and validated a new algorithm with high accuracy, interpretability,
and robustness for coronary artery semantic labeling on ICAs.

generic and powerful means for prediction purposes. At the same time, there is
a growing demand for interpretability of prediction models. To determine which
features of a dataset are important to predict a target variable $Y$, a Feature
Importance (FI) method can be used. By quantifying how important each feature
is for predicting $Y$, irrelevant features can be identified and removed, which
could increase the speed and accuracy of a model, and moreover, important
features can be discovered, which could lead to valuable insights. A major
problem with evaluating FI methods, is that the ground truth FI is often
unknown. As a consequence, existing FI methods do not give the exact correct FI
values. This is one of the many reasons why it can be hard to properly
interpret the results of an FI method. Motivated by this, we introduce a new
global approach named the Berkelmans-Pries FI method, which is based on a
combination of Shapley values and the Berkelmans-Pries dependency function. We
prove that our method has many useful properties, and accurately predicts the
correct FI values for several cases where the ground truth FI can be derived in
an exact manner. We experimentally show for a large collection of FI methods
(468) that existing methods do not have the same useful properties. This shows
that the Berkelmans-Pries FI method is a highly valuable tool for analyzing
datasets with complex interdependencies.

preference elicitation and policy optimization require significantly fewer

can be synthesized safely and efficiently as a byproduct of standard
model-based RL, and (3) reward pre-training based on suboptimal demonstrations

surpass many SOTA models, which are already available to use on the Internet.
In this paper, we proposed a compact graph-based framework, named HADA, which
can combine pretrained models to produce a better result, rather than building
from scratch. First, we created a graph structure in which the nodes were the
features extracted from the pretrained models and the edges connecting them.
The graph structure was employed to capture and fuse the information from every
pretrained model with each other. Then a graph neural network was applied to
update the connection between the nodes to get the representative embedding
vector for an image and text. Finally, we used the cosine similarity to match
images with their relevant texts and vice versa to ensure a low inference time.
Our experiments showed that, although HADA contained a tiny number of trainable
parameters, it could increase baseline performance by more than 3.6% in terms
of evaluation metrics in the Flickr30k dataset. Additionally, the proposed
model did not train on any external dataset and did not require many GPUs but
only 1 to train due to its small number of parameters. The source code is

the analysis makes opportunistic use of four days of aerial imagery gathered

interests for disease assessment such as minimally invasive surgery and tumor

low-cost and real-time acquisition. However, generating a precise landmark
tracklet is very challenging, as attempts can be easily distorted by different
interference such as landmark deformation, visual ambiguity and partial
observation. In this paper, we propose a long-short diffeomorphic motion
network, which is a multi-task framework with a learnable deformation prior to
search for the plausible deformation of landmark. Specifically, we design a
novel diffeomorphism representation in both long and short temporal domains for
delineating motion margins and reducing long-term cumulative tracking errors.
To further mitigate local anatomical ambiguity, we propose an expectation
maximisation motion alignment module to iteratively optimize both long and
short deformation, aligning to the same directional and spatial representation.
The proposed multi-task system can be trained in a weakly-supervised manner,

that DFT calculations of charge transfer have cell size dependencies due to a

results indicate that the nitrogen and boron anitsites do not participate in

consequences on reducing the costs of deploying and executing the contracts, as
there are fees to pay related to their bytes-size and to their resource

problem that, among other things, requires a precise inference of the memory
locations being accessed. This is also the case for the Ethereum Virtual
Machine (EVM) bytecode generated by the most-widely used compiler,
\texttt{solc}, whose rather unconventional and low-level memory usage
challenges automated reasoning. This paper presents a static analysis,
developed at the level of the EVM bytecode generated by \texttt{solc}, that
infers write memory accesses that are needless and thus can be safely removed.
The application of our implementation on more than 19,000 real smart contracts
has detected about 6,200 needless write accesses in less than 4 hours.
Interestingly, many of these writes were involved in memory usage patterns
generated by \texttt{solc} that can be greatly optimized by removing entire
blocks of bytecodes. To the best of our knowledge, existing optimization tools
cannot infer such needless write accesses, and hence cannot detect these
inefficiencies that affect both the deployment and the execution costs of
Ethereum smart contracts.

coupling, we show the emergence of two topological Uhlmann phase transitions
when the magnetic field evolves around the equator, where a winding number can
characterize each temperature range. For small couplings, the width of the
temperature gap of the non-trivial phase is roughly the critical temperature
$T_c$ of one-dimensional fermion systems with two-band Hamiltonians. The first
phase transition in the low-temperature regime and small values of the coupling
corresponds to the peak of the \textit{Schottky anomaly} of the heat capacity,
typical of a two-level system in solid-state physics involving the ground and
first excited states. The second phase transition occurs at temperatures very
close to the second maximum of the heat capacity associated with a multilevel
system. We also derive analytical expressions for the thermal Uhlmann phase for
both subsystems, showing that they exhibit phase transitions. In the driven
subsystem, for minimal $g$, a topological phase transition phase appears at
$T_c$ again. However, for larger values of $g$, the transitions occur at lower
temperature values, and they disappear when the coupling reaches a critical
value $g_c$. The latter is not the case for the undriven subsystem, where at
low temperatures, a single phase transition occurs at $g_c$. Nevertheless, as
the temperature rises, we demonstrate the emergence of two phase transitions
defining a coupling gap, where the phase is non-trivial and vanishes as the

driven charge transport in solids, or vice versa for cooling. To be competitive
with conventional energy-generation technologies, a thermoelectric material
must possess the properties of both an electrical conductor and a thermal
insulator. However, these properties are normally mutually exclusive because of
the interconnection of the scattering mechanisms for charge carriers and
phonons. Recent theoretical investigations on sub-device scales have revealed
that silicon membranes covered by nanopillars exhibit a multitude of local
phonon resonances, spanning the full spectrum, that couple with the
heat-carrying phonons in the membrane and collectively cause a reduction in the
in-plane thermal conductivity$-$while, in principle, not affecting the
electrical properties because the nanopillars are external to the pathway of
voltage generation and charge transport. Here this effect is demonstrated
experimentally for the first time by investigating device-scale suspended
silicon membranes with GaN nanopillars grown on the surface. The nanopillars
cause up to 21 % reduction in the thermal conductivity while the electrical
conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient remain unaffected, thus demonstrating
an unprecedented decoupling in the semiconductor's thermoelectric properties.
The measured thermal conductivity behavior for coalesced nanopillars and
corresponding lattice-dynamics calculations provide further evidence that the
reductions are mechanistically tied to the phonon resonances. This finding
breaks a longstanding trade-off between competing properties in
thermoelectricity and paves the way for engineered high-efficiency solid-state
energy recovery and cooling.

adaptability to supporting different network scenarios. Recently, open-RAN

implementations. O-RAN is a natural architectural fit for cell-free massive
multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems, where many
geographically-distributed access points (APs) are employed to achieve
ubiquitous coverage and enhanced user performance. In this paper, we address
the decentralized pilot assignment (PA) problem for scalable O-RAN-based
CFmMIMO systems. We propose a low-complexity PA scheme using a multi-agent deep
reinforcement learning (MA-DRL) framework in which multiple learning agents
perform distributed learning over the O-RAN communication architecture to
suppress pilot contamination. Our approach does not require prior channel
knowledge but instead relies on real-time interactions made with the
environment during the learning procedure. In addition, we design a codebook
search (CS) scheme that exploits the decentralization of our O-RAN CFmMIMO
architecture, where different codebook sets can be utilized to further improve
PA performance without any significant additional complexities. Numerical
evaluations verify that our proposed scheme provides substantial computational
scalability advantages and improvements in channel estimation performance
compared to the state-of-the-art.

experimental estimates may be of limited use for policy decisions. We begin by
decomposing the extrapolation bias from estimating the Target Average Treatment

shift, overlap, and effect modification components, which researchers can
reason about in order to diagnose the severity of extrapolation bias. Next, We
cast covariate shift as a sample selection problem and propose estimators that
re-weight the doubly-robust scores from experimental subjects to estimate
treatment effects in the overall sample (=: generalization) or in an alternate
target sample (=: transportation). We implement these estimators in the
open-source R package causalTransportR and illustrate its performance in a

compression of FeO at high temperatures induces a gradual orbitally selective
insulator-metal transition. Specifically, at P-T conditions of the lower

of strongly correlated electronic matter. Transport in this regime, distinct
from insulating or metallic behavior, is marked by incoherent diffusion of
electrons in the conducting t_{2g} orbital and a band gap in the e_g orbital,
resulting in moderate electrical conductivity (~ 10^5 S/m) with modest P -T

The problem of learning such simulations is called predictive world modeling.
Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) agents leveraging world models have

apply the world modeling approach in complex real-world environments relevant
to mobile robots remains an open question. In this paper, we present a
framework for learning a probabilistic predictive world model for real-world
road environments. We implement the model using a hierarchical VAE (HVAE)
capable of predicting a diverse set of fully observed plausible worlds from
accumulated sensor observations. While prior HVAE methods require complete
states as ground truth for learning, we present a novel sequential training
method to allow HVAEs to learn to predict complete states from partially
observed states only. We experimentally demonstrate accurate spatial structure
prediction of deterministic regions achieving 96.21 IoU, and close the gap to
perfect prediction by 62% for stochastic regions using the best prediction. By
extending HVAEs to cases where complete ground truth states do not exist, we
facilitate continual learning of spatial prediction as a step towards realizing
explainable and comprehensive predictive world models for real-world mobile
robotics applications. Code is available at

deploying neural network-based applications to the real world. To achieve
stronger robustness, existing methods primarily focus on how to generate strong

the smoothed loss function, and injecting the randomness into the attack.
Instead, we analyze the behavior of adversarial training through the lens of
response frequency. We empirically discover that adversarial training causes
neural networks to have low convergence to high-frequency information,
resulting in highly oscillated predictions near each data. To learn
high-frequency contents efficiently and effectively, we first prove that a
universal phenomenon of frequency principle, i.e., \textit{lower frequencies
are learned first}, still holds in adversarial training. Based on that, we
propose phase-shifted adversarial training (PhaseAT) in which the model learns
high-frequency components by shifting these frequencies to the low-frequency
range where the fast convergence occurs. For evaluations, we conduct the
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with the adaptive attack carefully
designed for reliable evaluation. Comprehensive results show that PhaseAT
significantly improves the convergence for high-frequency information. This
results in improved adversarial robustness by enabling the model to have

asymptotic flat black holes. By making use of the equation of motion of the
massive particles, we construct a vector with its zero points exactly relating
with the timelike circular orbits. Since each zero point of the vector can be
endowed with a winding number, the topology of the timelike circular orbits is
established. Stable and unstable timelike circular orbits respectively have
winding number +1 and -1. In particular, different from that of the light ring,
the timelike circular orbits possess vanishing topological number and appear in
pairs for given angular momentum. Moreover, we apply the study to the
Schwarzschild, scalarized Einstein-Maxwell, and dyonic black holes, which have
distinct topological configurations. It is shown that although the existence of
scalar hair and quasi-topological term leads to richer topological
configurations of the timelike circular orbits, whereas they have no influence
on the topological number. These results indicate that the topological approach
indeed provides us a novel way to understand the timelike circular orbits. More

for less discriminative projections of sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance. In
applications that have various independent pairs of probability measures,
amortized projection optimization is utilized to predict the ``max"" projecting
directions given two input measures instead of using projected gradient ascent
multiple times. Despite being efficient, Max-SW and its amortized version
cannot guarantee metricity property due to the sub-optimality of the projected
gradient ascent and the amortization gap. Therefore, we propose to replace
Max-SW with distributional sliced Wasserstein distance with von Mises-Fisher
(vMF) projecting distribution (v-DSW). Since v-DSW is a metric with any
non-degenerate vMF distribution, its amortized version can guarantee the
metricity when performing amortization. Furthermore, current amortized models
are not permutation invariant and symmetric. To address the issue, we design
amortized models based on self-attention architecture. In particular, we adopt
efficient self-attention architectures to make the computation linear in the
number of supports. With the two improvements, we derive self-attention
amortized distributional projection optimization and show its appealing
performance in point-cloud reconstruction and its downstream applications.

  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2201.11624",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Long short-term memory (LSTM) is one of the robust recurrent neural network
architectures for learning sequential data. However, it requires considerable
computational power to learn and implement both software and hardware aspects.
This paper proposed a novel LiteLSTM architecture based on reducing the LSTM
computation components via the weights sharing concept to reduce the overall
architecture computation cost and maintain the architecture performance. The
proposed LiteLSTM can be significant for processing large data where
time-consuming is crucial while hardware resources are limited, such as the
security of IoT devices and medical data processing. The proposed model was
evaluated and tested empirically on three different datasets from the computer
vision, cybersecurity, speech emotion recognition domains. The proposed
LiteLSTM has comparable accuracy to the other state-of-the-art recurrent
architecture while using a smaller computation budget.

treatment of colorectal cancer. However, it has always been very challenging
due to the diverse shape and size of polyp. In recent years, state-of-the-art
methods have achieved significant breakthroughs in this task with the help of
deep convolutional neural networks. However, few algorithms explicitly consider
the impact of the size and shape of the polyp and the complex spatial context
on the segmentation performance, which results in the algorithms still being
powerless for complex samples. In fact, segmentation of polyps of different
sizes relies on different local and global contextual information for regional
contrast reasoning. To tackle these issues, we propose an adaptive context
selection based encoder-decoder framework which is composed of Local Context
Attention (LCA) module, Global Context Module (GCM) and Adaptive Selection
Module (ASM). Specifically, LCA modules deliver local context features from
encoder layers to decoder layers, enhancing the attention to the hard region
which is determined by the prediction map of previous layer. GCM aims to
further explore the global context features and send to the decoder layers. ASM
is used for adaptive selection and aggregation of context features through
channel-wise attention. Our proposed approach is evaluated on the EndoScene and

To address this methodological gap, we propose a network regression model
motivated by the important observation that controlling for community structure
can, when a network is modular, significantly account for meaningful
correlation between observations induced by network connections. We propose a
generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach to learn model parameters based
on clusters defined through any single-membership community detection algorithm

network size and edge formation probabilities to establish the asymptotic
normality of the model parameters under the assumption that the graph structure
is a stochastic block model. We evaluate the performance of our approach

covariates and network effects on COVID-19 incidence rate among countries

latent haze-free images from observed hazy images. Some existing deep learning
based methods are devoted to improving the model performance via increasing the
depth or width of convolution. The learning ability of convolutional neural
network (CNN) structure is still under-explored. In this paper, a
detail-enhanced attention block (DEAB) consisting of the detail-enhanced
convolution (DEConv) and the content-guided attention (CGA) is proposed to
boost the feature learning for improving the dehazing performance.
Specifically, the DEConv integrates prior information into normal convolution
layer to enhance the representation and generalization capacity. Then by using
the re-parameterization technique, DEConv is equivalently converted into a
vanilla convolution with NO extra parameters and computational cost. By
assigning unique spatial importance map (SIM) to every channel, CGA can attend
more useful information encoded in features. In addition, a CGA-based mixup
fusion scheme is presented to effectively fuse the features and aid the
gradient flow. By combining above mentioned components, we propose our
detail-enhanced attention network (DEA-Net) for recovering high-quality
haze-free images. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
of our DEA-Net, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by boosting

with the structure named `Pa 30', while subsequent workers made connections to
mergers of white dwarfs, to the supernova subclass of low-luminosity Type Iax,
and to the 1181 transient. Here, I provide a wide range of new observational
evidence: First, detailed analysis of the original Chinese and Japanese reports
places the `Guest Star' of 1181 into a small region with the only interesting

fading from $B$=14.9 in 1889, to $B$=16.20 in 1950, to $B$=16.58 in 2022.
Fourth, recent light curves show typical variability with full-amplitude of
0.24 mag on time-scales of one day and longer, critically with no coherent
modulations for periods from 0.00046--10 days to strict limits. Fifth, the
spectral energy distribution from the far-infrared to the ultraviolet is a

smart agent to that of the naive agent decreases with the increase of $\Gamma$,
indicating more propelling energy can be saved by the smart agent in a larger

of OUD rely on the advances in understanding the neurobiological mechanism of
opioid dependence. Proteins including mu, delta, kappa, nociceptin, and zeta
opioid receptors are the direct targets of opioids. Each receptor has a large
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, that behaves differently when
subjected to various treatments, thus increasing the complexity in the drug
development process for an effective opioid addiction treatment. The report

study of OUD. We have examined more than 500 proteins in the five opioid

evaluations of screening and repurposing potential of drug candidates for four

messages at all. Moreover, the adversary partitions the committee into a set of
good processors $G_r$ and a set of processors $F_r$ that it impersonates during
round $r$. If we fix $F_r$ to be static, i.e. the same in all rounds, we obtain
an idealized version of the Sleepy Model of Pass and Shi. If both $G_r$ and

pleasing results because, contrary to the traditional, eventually-synchronous
model, there is no resiliency gap between the static and non-static cases (in
the traditional model, resiliency degrades from half under synchrony to one
third under eventual synchrony). Moreover, these results are new even for the

for Langevin equations, we revisit the considerations for using non-Gaussian
distributions for the thermal noise term in discrete-time thermostats. We find
that the desirable time-step invariance of the modern methods is rooted in the
Gaussian noise, and that deviations from this distribution will distort the
Boltzmann statistics arising from the fluctuation-dissipation balance of the
integrators. We use the GJ stochastic Verlet methods as the focus of our
investigation since these methods are the ones that contain the most accurate
thermodynamic measures of existing methods. Within this set of methods we find
that any distribution of applied noise, which satisfies the two first moments
given by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, will result in correct, time-step
independent results that are generated by the first two moments of the system
coordinates. However, if non-Gaussian noise is applied, undesired deviations in
higher moments of the system coordinates will appear to the detriment of
several important thermodynamic measures that depend especially on the fourth
moments. The deviations, induced by non-Gaussian noise, become significant with
the one-time-step velocity attenuation, thereby inhibiting the benefits of the
methods. Thus, we conclude that the application of Gaussian noise is necessary
for reliable thermodynamic results when using modern stochastic thermostats

lens-induced birefringence (LIB): a different speed of the two linear GW
polarisations ($+$ and $\times$). Inhomogeneities then act as non-isotropic
crystals, splitting the GW signal into two components whose relative time delay
depends on the theory and lens parameters. Here we study the observational
prospects for GW scrambling, i.e when the time delay between both GW
polarisations is smaller than the signal's duration and the waveform recorded
by a detector is distorted. We analyze the latest LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog,
GWTC-3, and find no conclusive evidence for LIB. The highest log Bayes factor
that we find in favour of LIB is $3.21$ for GW$190521$, a particularly loud but
short event. However, when accounting for false alarms due to (Gaussian) noise
fluctuations, this evidence is below 1-$\sigma$. The tightest constraint on the
time delay is $<0.51$ ms (90% C.L.) from GW$200311\_115853$. From the
non-observation of GW scrambling, we constrain the optical depth for LIB,
accounting for the chance of randomly distributed lenses (eg. galaxies) along
the line of sight. Our LIB constraints on a (quartic) scalar-tensor Horndeski
theory are more stringent than solar system tests for a wide parameter range
and comparable to GW170817 in some limits. Interpreting GW190521 as an AGN
binary (i.e. taking an AGN flare as a counterpart) allows even more stringent
constraints. Our results demonstrate the potential and high sensitivity

leading to this controversy lies at an artificial scheme that whether the
external optical frequency is taken as continuous variable or bosonic Matsubara
frequency to handle the gap dynamics within the Matsubara formalism. To resolve
this issue, we derive the effective action of the superconducting gap near

Keldysh formalism, which is totally irrelevant to the Matsubara space. By
calculating the gap dynamics in the second-order response, it is analytically
proved that the involved optical frequency is a continuous variable rather than

traffic controller subject to CBF-based safety constraints. Considering that
some state information of the following HDVs may be unavailable to the CAV, we
employ state observer-based CBFs for STC. Finally, we conduct extensive
numerical simulations -- that include vehicle trajectories from real data -- to
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving string stable
and, at the same time, provably safe traffic.

excitation probability attains a Planck-like spectrum irrespective of the
non-existence of an underlying conformal symmetry for a general class of static
spherically symmetric black holes. In our analysis we have gone beyond the near
horizon approximation for the rotating and charged case and even without the
consideration of the conformal symmetry we observe a similar Planck-like
spectrum. However, the coefficient of the spectrum is significantly different
from the near horizon case. We have then considered a different scenario where
a two-level atom emits multiple photons while freely falling into the event
horizon of the Kerr-Newman black hole. It is observed that the Planck factor in
the excitation probability is significantly small than that of the case of
single-photon emission (for large number of simultaneously emitted photons from
the two-level atom). Finally, we have computed the von-Neumann entropy which is
also known as the horizon brightened acceleration radiation entropy or the HBAR
entropy. We have carried out our analysis for a scalar field only to see the
effect of the charge and rotation of the black hole in this particular
scenario.

a lot of interest in the past two decades. Due to the label scarcity in
practice, semi-supervised time series classification with only a few labeled
samples has become popular. Recently, Similarity-aware Time Series
Classification (SimTSC) is proposed to address this problem by using a graph
neural network classification model on the graph generated from pairwise
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance of batch data. It shows excellent accuracy
and outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in several few-label
settings. However, since SimTSC relies on pairwise DTW distances, the quadratic
complexity of DTW limits its usability to only reasonably sized datasets. To
address this challenge, we propose a new efficient semi-supervised time series
classification technique, LB-SimTSC, with a new graph construction module.
Instead of using DTW, we propose to utilize a lower bound of DTW, LB_Keogh, to
approximate the dissimilarity between instances in linear time, while retaining
the relative proximity relationships one would have obtained via computing DTW.
We construct the pairwise distance matrix using LB_Keogh and build a graph for
the graph neural network. We apply this approach to the ten largest datasets
from the well-known UCR time series classification archive. The results
demonstrate that this approach can be up to 104x faster than SimTSC when
constructing the graph on large datasets without significantly decreasing
classification accuracy.

planar extensional flow, in the limit of a dominant drop phase resistance. For
this interior problem, we consider the effect of drop-deformation-induced
change in streamline topology on the transport rate (the Nusselt number $Nu$).
The importance of drop deformation is characterized by the Capillary number
($Ca$). For a spherical drop ($Ca = 0$), closed streamlines lead to the ratio
$Nu/Nu_0$ increasing with the Peclet number($Pe$), from unity to a
diffusion-limited plateau value ($\approx 4.1$); $Nu_0$ here denotes the purely
diffusive rate of transport. For any finite $Ca$, the flow field consists of
spiralling streamlines that densely wind around nested tori foliating the
deformed drop interior. $Nu$ now increases beyond the aforementioned primary
plateau, saturating in a secondary plateau that approaches $23.3$ for $Ca
\rightarrow 0$, $Pe Ca \rightarrow \infty$, and appears independent of the
drop-to-medium viscosity ratio. $Nu/Nu_0$ exhibits an analogous variation for
other planar linear flows, although chaotically wandering streamlines in these

of regular $*$-semigroups. This class occupies something of a `sweet spot'
between the important classes of inverse and regular semigroups, and contains
many important and natural examples. Some of the most significant families
include the partition, Brauer and Temperley-Lieb monoids, among other diagram
monoids.
  Our main result shows that the category of regular $*$-semigroups is
isomorphic to the category of so-called `chained projection groupoids'. Such a
groupoid is in fact a pair $(\mathcal G,\varepsilon)$, where:
  $\bullet$ $\mathcal G$ is an ordered groupoid, whose object set $P$ is a
projection algebra (in the sense of Imaoka and Jones), and
  $\bullet$ $\varepsilon:\mathscr C\to\mathcal G$ is a special functor, where
$\mathscr C$ is a certain natural `chain groupoid' constructed from $P$.
  Roughly speaking: the groupoid $\mathcal G$ remembers only the `easy'
products in a regular $*$-semigroup $S$; the projection algebra $P$ remembers
only the `conjugation action' of the projections of $S$; and the functor
$\varepsilon$ tells us how $\mathcal G$ and $P$ `fit together' in order to
recover the entire structure of $S$. In this way, our main result contains the
first completely general structure theorem for regular $*$-semigroups.
  Among other applications, we use our structure theorem to obtain new, and
perhaps more transparent, constructions of fundamental regular $*$-semigroups.
We also use the chain groupoids to demonstrate the existence of free
(idempotent-generated) regular $*$-semigroups associated to arbitrary
projection algebras. Specialising to inverse semigroups, we also obtain a new
proof of the celebrated Ehresmann--Schein--Nambooripad Theorem.
  We consider several examples along the way, and pose a number of problems
that we believe are worthy of further attention.

altruistic punishers cooperate in the first stage and punish defectors in the
second stage, and the exiters who simply exit the game in favor of a small
payoff. We found that exiters did not provide any substantial assistance to
altruistic punishment in well-mixed populations, they destabilize defection and
finally replace them. In the finite population, although the exit option
enables the coexistence of altruistic punishers, defectors, and exiters through
cyclic dominance. Altruistic punishers never dominate the finite population and
the exit option provides another alternative cyclic dominance route for the
emergence of non-punishing cooperators. In networked populations, however,
adding the exit option allows for the establishment of altruistic punishment,
and enables the coexistence of altruistic punishers, defectors, and exiters
through cyclic dominance. However, this type of cyclic dominance is not always
stable, with adjustments to the exit payoff, this type of cyclic dominance is
replaced by the cyclic dominance of non-punishing cooperators, defectors, and
exiters or a bi-stable state between these two types of cyclic dominance. Our
results indicate that although the exit option can help explain altruistic

unified difficulty measure that can be theoretically guaranteed for training
samples does not exist. The learning difficulties of the samples are determined
by multiple factors including noise level, imbalance degree, margin, and
uncertainty. Nevertheless, existing measures only consider a single factor or
in part, but not in their entirety. Second, a comprehensive theoretical
explanation is lacking with respect to demonstrating why difficulty-based
weighting schemes are effective in deep learning. In this study, we
theoretically prove that the generalization error of a sample can be used as a

autoregressive models where the autoregressive coefficient is local to unity,
which is empirically relevant given the results of earlier studies. Under this
specification, we theoretically analyze the effect of the correlation between
the random coefficient and disturbance on tests' properties, which remains
largely unexplored in the literature. Our analysis reveals that the correlation
crucially affects the power of tests for coefficient randomness and that tests
proposed by earlier studies can perform poorly when the degree of the
correlation is moderate to large. The test we propose in this paper is designed
to have a power function robust to the correlation. Because the asymptotic null
distribution of our test statistic depends on the correlation $\psi$ between
the disturbance and its square as earlier tests do, we also propose a modified
version of the test statistic such that its asymptotic null distribution is
free from the nuisance parameter $\psi$. The modified test is shown to have
better power properties than existing ones in large and finite samples.

attractive representation method for 3D reconstruction tasks due to its
excellent performance. However, as the raw data quality deteriorates, the
implicit functions often lead to unsatisfactory reconstruction results. To this
end, we propose a novel edge-preserving implicit surface reconstruction method,
which mainly consists of a differentiable Laplican regularizer and a dynamic
edge sampling strategy. Among them, the differential Laplican regularizer can
effectively alleviate the implicit surface unsmoothness caused by the point

smoothing at the edge regions of implicit suface, we proposed a dynamic edge
extract strategy for sampling near the sharp edge of point cloud, which can
effectively avoid the Laplacian regularizer from smoothing all regions.
Finally, we combine them with a simple regularization term for robust implicit

experimental results show that our method significantly improves the quality of
3D reconstruction results. Moreover, we demonstrate through several experiments
that our method can be conveniently and effectively applied to some point cloud

diagnosis. However, existing CNN based methods rely heavily on massive manual
annotations, which are very expensive and require huge human resources. In this
work, we adopt a coarse-to-fine strategy and propose a self-supervised
correction learning paradigm for semi-supervised biomedical image segmentation.
Specifically, we design a dual-task network, including a shared encoder and two
independent decoders for segmentation and lesion region inpainting,
respectively. In the first phase, only the segmentation branch is used to
obtain a relatively rough segmentation result. In the second step, we mask the
detected lesion regions on the original image based on the initial segmentation
map, and send it together with the original image into the network again to
simultaneously perform inpainting and segmentation separately. For labeled
data, this process is supervised by the segmentation annotations, and for
unlabeled data, it is guided by the inpainting loss of masked lesion regions.
Since the two tasks rely on similar feature information, the unlabeled data
effectively enhances the representation of the network to the lesion regions
and further improves the segmentation performance. Moreover, a gated feature
fusion (GFF) module is designed to incorporate the complementary features from
the two tasks. Experiments on three medical image segmentation datasets for
different tasks including polyp, skin lesion and fundus optic disc segmentation
well demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method compared with other

segmentation, lots of works have been proposed focusing on extracting
discriminative pixel feature representations. However, we observe that existing
methods still suffer from two typical challenges, i.e. (i) large intra-class
feature variation in different scenes, (ii) small inter-class feature
distinction in the same scene. In this paper, we first rethink semantic
segmentation from a perspective of similarity between pixels and class centers.
Each weight vector of the segmentation head represents its corresponding
semantic class in the whole dataset, which can be regarded as the embedding of
the class center. Thus, the pixel-wise classification amounts to computing
similarity in the final feature space between pixels and the class centers.
Under this novel view, we propose a Class Center Similarity layer (CCS layer)
to address the above-mentioned challenges by generating adaptive class centers
conditioned on different scenes and supervising the similarities between class
centers. It utilizes a Adaptive Class Center Module (ACCM) to generate class
centers conditioned on each scene, which adapt the large intra-class variation
between different scenes. Specially designed loss functions are introduced to
control both inter-class and intra-class distances based on predicted
center-to-center and pixel-to-center similarity, respectively. Finally, the CCS
layer outputs the processed pixel-to-center similarity as the segmentation
prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model performs

method of learning to memorize entailment and discourse relations for

thus understanding the action of these vibrations using a simple theoretical
model is highly desirable. The generalized Langevin equation is one such model,
as it can reduce all the aspects how vibrations modulate the motion of a
surface site into a single quantity: the memory kernel. Here we build on work
originally done by Tully in developing the generalized Langevin oscillator
(GLO) model of surface vibrations by calculating the memory kernel directly
from atomistic models. We show that the memory kernel has a universal bimodal
form due to coupling to both low-energy acoustic modes and modes near the Debye
frequency. We study the size dependence of these modes and argue that the
acoustic modes are frozen in limit of macroscopic lattices. We then use this
insight to illustrate how finite size effects from nanoscale systems, such as
those studied with atomistic simulations, can alter surface adsorption and
desorption.

the scenario of a hierarchical triple system made of a Kerr black hole and an

computed solely on annotated areas and generate pseudo gold standard
segmentation by propagating labels to adjacent areas. However, these methods
could suffer from the inaccurate and sometimes unrealistic pseudo segmentation
due to the insufficient supervision and incomplete shape features. Different
from previous efforts, we first investigate the principle of ''good scribble
annotations'', which leads to efficient scribble forms via supervision
maximization and randomness simulation. Furthermore, we introduce
regularization terms to encode the spatial relationship and shape prior, where
a new formulation is developed to estimate the mixture ratios of label classes.
These ratios are critical in identifying the unlabeled pixels for each class
and correcting erroneous predictions, thus the accurate estimation lays the
foundation for the incorporation of spatial prior. Finally, we integrate the
efficient scribble supervision with the prior into a unified framework, denoted
as ZScribbleSeg, and apply the method to multiple scenarios. Leveraging only
scribble annotations, ZScribbleSeg set new state-of-the-arts on four

quantum dimension of the associated primary operator, in agreement with the
case of entanglement entropy. However, for linear combination operators
generated by the generic summation of Virasoro generators, we obtain a distinct
late-time excess formula for the pseudo-(R\'enyi) entropy compared to that for
(R\'enyi) entanglement entropy. As the mixing of holomorphic and
antiholomorphic generators enhances the entanglement, in this case, the
pseudo-(R\'enyi) entropy can receive an additional contribution. The additional
contribution can be expressed as the pseudo-(R\'enyi) entropy of an effective
transition matrix in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space.

matched simple thermal models of water activity to the combined Rosetta

outgassing induced non-gravitational force and torque, with a final manual
adjustment of the model parameters to additionally match the other two torque
components. We parametrised the thermal model in terms of a distribution of
relative activity over the surface of the comet, and attempted to link this to
different terrain types. We also tested a more advanced thermal model based on
a pebble structure. Results. We confirm a hemispherical dichotomy and
non-linear water outgassing response to insolation. The southern hemisphere of
the comet and consolidated terrain show enhanced activity relative to the
northern hemisphere and dust-covered, unconsolidated terrain types, especially
at perihelion. We further find that the non-gravitational torque is especially
sensitive to the activity distribution, and to fit the pole-axis orientation in
particular, activity must be concentrated (in excess of the already high
activity in the southern hemisphere and consolidated terrain) around the south
pole and on the body and neck of the comet over its head. This is the case for
both the simple thermal model and the pebble-based model. Overall, our results
show that water activity cannot be matched by a simple model of sublimating
surface ice driven by the insolation alone, regardless of the surface
distribution, and that both local spatial and temporal variations are needed to
fit the data.

NdAlSi does not exhibit an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that is commonly

  The task is to find tables in a data lake that can be unioned with a given

We then find union-able tables based on similarities between their constituent

colorectal cancer diagnosis. However, it has always been a challenging task due
to 1) the diverse shape, size, brightness and other appearance characteristics

regions. To address these problems, we propose a lesion-aware dynamic network
(LDNet) for polyp segmentation, which is a traditional u-shape encoder-decoder
structure incorporated with a dynamic kernel generation and updating scheme.
Specifically, the designed segmentation head is conditioned on the global
context features of the input image and iteratively updated by the extracted
lesion features according to polyp segmentation predictions. This simple but
effective scheme endows our model with powerful segmentation performance and
generalization capability. Besides, we utilize the extracted lesion
representation to enhance the feature contrast between the polyp and background
regions by a tailored lesion-aware cross-attention module (LCA), and design an
efficient self-attention module (ESA) to capture long-range context relations,
further improving the segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four
public polyp benchmarks and our collected large-scale polyp dataset demonstrate
the superior performance of our method compared with other state-of-the-art
approaches. The source code is available at https://github.com/ReaFly/LDNet.

  foams",,,,,"physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to their good ratio of stiffness and strength to weight, foam materials
find use in lightweight engineering. Though, in many applications like
structural bending or tension, the scale separation between macroscopic
structure and the foam's mesostructure like cells size, is relatively weak and
the mechanical properties of the foam appear to be size dependent. Positive as
well as negative size effects have been observed for certain basic tests of
foams, i.e., the material appears either to be more compliant or stiffer than
would be expected from larger specimens. Performing tests with sufficiently
small specimens is challenging as any disturbances from damage of cell walls
during sample preparation or from loading devices must be avoided.
Correspondingly, the number of respective data in literature is relatively low
and the results are partly contradictory.
  In order to avoid the problems from sample preparation or bearings, the
present study employs virtual tests with CT data of real medium-density ceramic
foams. A number of samples of different size is ""cut"" from the resulting voxel
data. Subsequently, the apparent elastic properties of each virtual sample are
""measured"" directly by a free vibrational analysis using finite cell method,
thereby avoiding any disturbances from load application or bearings. The
results exhibit a large scatter of the apparent moduli per sample size, but
with a clear negative size effect in all investigated basic modes of
deformation (bending, torsion, uniaxial). Finally, the results are compared
qualitatively and quantitatively to available experimental data from
literature, yielding common trends as well as open questions.

investigate an alternative formation scenario, i.e., binary BHs (BBHs) formed

scenario, the two helium stars (He-rich stars) could be the outcome of the
classical isolated binary evolution scenario involving with and without
common-envelope phase (i.e., CE channel and stable mass transfer channel), or
alternatively of massive close binaries evolving chemically homogeneously
(i.e., CHE channel). We perform detailed stellar structure and binary evolution
calculations that take into account internal differential rotation and mass
loss of He-rich stars, as well as tidal interactions in binaries. For double
He-rich stars with equal masses in binaries, we find that tides start to be at
work on the Zero Age Helium Main Sequence (ZAHeMS: the time when a He-rich star
starts to burn helium in the core, which is analogous to ZAMS for core hydrogen
burning) for initial orbital periods not longer than 1.0 day, depending on the
initial metallicities. Besides the stellar mass loss rate and tidal
interactions in binaries, we find that the role of the angular momentum
transport efficiency in determining the resulting BH spins, becomes stronger

could be faulty and behave arbitrarily. Three properties characterize
consensus: (1) termination, requiring correct (non-faulty) processes to
eventually reach a decision, (2) agreement, preventing them from deciding
different values, and (3) validity, precluding ``unreasonable'' decisions. But,
what is a reasonable decision? Strong validity, a classical property,
stipulates that, if all correct processes propose the same value, only that
value can be decided. Weak validity, another established property, stipulates
that, if all processes are correct and they propose the same value, that value
must be decided. The space of possible validity properties is vast. However,
their impact on consensus remains unclear.
  This paper addresses the question of which validity properties allow
Byzantine consensus to be solvable with partial synchrony, and at what cost.
First, we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for a validity property
to make the consensus problem solvable; we say that such validity properties
are solvable. Notably, we prove that, if n <= 3t, all solvable validity
properties are trivial (there exists an always-admissible decision).
Furthermore, we show that, with any non-trivial (and solvable) validity
property, consensus requires Omega(t^2) messages. This extends the seminal
Dolev-Reischuk bound, originally proven for strong validity, to all non-trivial
validity properties. Lastly, we give a general Byzantine consensus algorithm,
we call Universal, for any solvable (and non-trivial) validity property.
Importantly, Universal incurs O(n^2) message complexity. Thus, together with
our lower bound, Universal implies a fundamental result in partial synchrony:
with t \in Omega(n), the message complexity of all (non-trivial) consensus
variants is Theta(n^2).

ideal of ghost operators coming from expander graphs and in contrast to the
notion of geometric ideal, we introduce a notion of ghostly ideal in a uniform
Roe algebra, whose elements are locally invisible in certain directions at
infinity. We show that the geometric ideal and the ghostly ideal are
respectively the smallest and the largest element in the lattice of ideals with
a common invariant open subset of the unit space of the coarse groupoid by
Skandalis-Tu-Yu, and hence the study of ideal structure can be reduced to
classifying ideals between the geometric and the ghostly ones. As an
application, we provide a concrete description for the maximal ideals in a
uniform Roe algebra in terms of the minimal points in the Stone-\v{C}ech
boundary of the space. We also provide a criterion to ensure that the geometric
and the ghostly ideals have the same $K$-theory, which helps to recover
counterexamples to the Baum-Connes type conjectures. Moreover, we introduce a
notion of partial Property A for a metric space to characterise the situation

lines rotate around the planet, and also a region where the open field lines
stretch away from the planet, forming the lobes of the magnetotail. This paper
shows that there could be a third, significantly different region, where the
closed field lines form twisted vortex structures anchored in the magnetotail.
Such patterns form when there are significant plasma sources inside the
magnetosphere and the time scale of the plasmoid formation process is
substantially larger than the planetary rotation period. In the presence of
vortices, the Dungey and Vasyliunas cycles act differently. The Dungey flow
does not penetrate the central region of the polar cap. Tail reconnection
events are rare, thus leaving the plasma time enough to participate in the
essentially 3-dimensional vortex-forming plasma motion. The above conditions
are fulfilled for Saturn. We discovered vortex-like patterns in the plasma and
magnetic field data measured by the Cassini spacecraft in the nightside
magnetosphere of Saturn. The plasma whirling around in these vortices never
reaches the dayside, instead, it performs a retrograde motion in the high
latitude regions of the magnetotail. Low-energy plasma data suggest that the
observed patterns correspond to the closed field line vortices.

have reproduced the orbital trajectories of 143 GCs 10 Gyr back in time using
our original phi-GPU N-body code. Each GC was treated as a single physical
particle with the assigned position and velocity of the cluster center from the
Gaia DR2 observations. For each of the potentials, 1000 initial conditions were
generated with randomized initial velocities of GCs within the errors of the
observational data. In this study, we consider close passages to be passages
with a relative distance of less than 100 pc and a relative speed of less than

following criterion is applied based only on the relative distance: it must be
less than 100 pc. Applying the above criteria, the authors obtained
statistically significant rates of close passages of GCs with respect to each

robots in the nodes of an unknown graph consisting of $n$ nodes such that in

propose a variant of the dispersion problem where we start with any number of
robots, and put an additional constraint that no two adjacent nodes contain
robots in the final configuration. We name this problem as
Distance-2-Dispersion (D-2-D). However, even if the number of robots $k$ is
less than $n$, it may not possible for each robot to find a distinct node to
reside, maintaining our added constraint. Specifically, if a maximal
independent set is already formed by the nodes which contain a robot each, then
other robots, if any, who are searching for a node to seat, will not find one.
Hence we allow multiple robots to seat on some nodes only if there is no place
to seat. If $k\geq n$, it is guaranteed that the nodes with robots form a
maximal independent set of the underlying network.
  The graph $G=(V, E)$ has $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, where nodes are anonymous.

decision processes (POMDPs). SPI is an offline reinforcement learning (RL)
problem that assumes access to (1) historical data about an environment, and
(2) the so-called behavior policy that previously generated this data by
interacting with the environment. SPI methods neither require access to a model
nor the environment itself, and aim to reliably improve the behavior policy in
an offline manner. Existing methods make the strong assumption that the
environment is fully observable. In our novel approach to the SPI problem for
POMDPs, we assume that a finite-state controller (FSC) represents the behavior
policy and that finite memory is sufficient to derive optimal policies. This
assumption allows us to map the POMDP to a finite-state fully observable MDP,
the history MDP. We estimate this MDP by combining the historical data and the
memory of the FSC, and compute an improved policy using an off-the-shelf SPI
algorithm. The underlying SPI method constrains the policy-space according to
the available data, such that the newly computed policy only differs from the
behavior policy when sufficient data was available. We show that this new
policy, converted into a new FSC for the (unknown) POMDP, outperforms the
behavior policy with high probability. Experimental results on several
well-established benchmarks show the applicability of the approach, even in
cases where finite memory is not sufficient.

analytical predictions and numerical experiments. Second, we aim to set the
range of validity of two fundamentally different numerical implementations for
the evolution of dust and gas mixtures in turbulent molecular clouds. We
carried out a suite of numerical experiments using two different schemes.
First, we used a monofluid formalism in the terminal velocity approximation
(TVA) on a Eulerian grid. Second, we used a two-fluid scheme, in which the dust
dynamics is handled with Lagrangian super-particles, and the gas dynamics on a
Eulerian grid. The monofluid results are in good agreement with the theoretical
critical size for decoupling. We report dust dynamics decoupling for Stokes
number St>0.1, that is, dust grains of $s>4~\mu$m in size. We find that the TVA
is well suited for grain sizes of 10 $\mu$m in molecular clouds, in particular
in the densest regions. However, the maximum dust enrichment measured in the
low-density material where St>1 is questionable. In the Lagrangian dust
experiments, we show that the results are affected by the numerics for all dust
grain sizes. At St<<1, the dust dynamics is largely affected by artificial
trapping in the high-density regions, leading to spurious variations of the
dust concentration. At St>1, the maximum dust enrichment is regulated by the
grid resolution used for the gas dynamics. The results of previous similar
numerical work should therefore be revisited with respect to the limitations we

a deep understanding of the different epochs of the universe from early to late

single and double quantum NV experiments are performed, which indicate a

of the turbulent/turbulent interface (TTI) in a cylinder wake. The wake is
exposed to various turbulent backgrounds in which the turbulence intensity and
the integral length scale are independently varied and comparisons to a
turbulent/non-turbulent interface (TNTI) are drawn. The turbulent wake was
marked with a high-Schmidt-number ($Sc$) scalar and a planar laser induced
fluorescence (PLIF) experiment was carried out to capture the interface between
the wake and the ambient flow from $x/d$ = 5 to 40 where $x$ is the streamwise
coordinate from the centre of the cylinder and $d$ is the cylinder's diameter.
It is found that the TTI generally spreads faster toward the ambient flow than
the TNTI. A transition region of the interfaces' spreading is found at $x/d
\approx 15$, after which the interfaces propagate at a slower rate than
previously (upstream) and the mean interface positions of both TNTI and TTI
scale with the local wake half-width. The location of both the TNTI and TTI
have non-Gaussian probability density functions (PDFs) in the near wake because
of the influence of the large-scale coherent motions present within the flow.
Further downstream, after the large-scale coherent motions have dissipated, the
TNTI position PDF does become Gaussian. For the first time we explore the
spatial variation of the ``roughness'' of the TTI, quantified via the fractal
dimension, from near field to far field. The length scale in the background
flow has a profound effect on the TTI fractal dimension in the near wake,
whilst the turbulence intensity only becomes important for the fractal
dimension farther downstream.

Magnetometry measurements demonstrated an exchange bias in the high pressure

gain depends only on the length and (possibly) the elevation of the link. To
alleviate this limitation, this paper proposes a scheme that accommodates
arbitrary channel gains by means of a propagation radio map of the
air-to-ground channel. The algorithm finds the locations of an approximately
minimal number of ABSs to serve all ground terminals with a target rate while
meeting the given constraints on the capacity of the backhaul links and
respecting no-fly regions. A convex-relaxation formulation ensures convergence
and the alternating-direction method of multipliers is utilized to derive an

$>280~\%$ with SOC and by $>345~\%$ without SOC. Through our computational

importance of image pixels for model classification is a popular technique for
explaining neural network decisions. Hierarchical dynamic masks (HDM), a novel
explanatory maps generation method, is proposed in this paper to enhance the
granularity and comprehensiveness of saliency maps. First, we suggest the
dynamic masks (DM), which enables multiple small-sized benchmark mask vectors
to roughly learn the critical information in the image through an optimization
method. Then the benchmark mask vectors guide the learning of large-sized
auxiliary mask vectors so that their superimposed mask can accurately learn
fine-grained pixel importance information and reduce the sensitivity to
adversarial perturbations. In addition, we construct the HDM by concatenating
DM modules. These DM modules are used to find and fuse the regions of interest
in the remaining neural network classification decisions in the mask image in a
learning-based way. Since HDM forces DM to perform importance analysis in
different areas, it makes the fused saliency map more comprehensive. The
proposed method outperformed previous approaches significantly in terms of
recognition and localization capabilities when tested on natural and medical
datasets.

a system of two coupled Rayleigh oscillators to demonstrate how a loss of
synchrony can be induced by stimulating a unit once per period at a specific
phase and detected by observing consecutive inter-pulse durations. Next, we
exploit the phase approximation to develop a rigorous theory formulating the

curves of many stars, some associated with magnetic activity or stellar
oscillations. In this work, we analyse the periodic signal in 162
intermediate-mass stars, interpreted as Rossby modes and rotational modulation
- the so-called \textit{hump \& spike} feature. We investigate whether the
rotational modulation (\textit{spike}) is due to stellar spots caused by
magnetic fields or due to Overstable Convective (OsC) modes resonantly exciting
g~modes, with frequencies corresponding to the convective core rotation rate.
Assuming that the spikes are created by magnetic spots at the stellar surface,
we recover the amplitudes of the magnetic fields, which are in good agreement
with theoretical predictions. Our data show a clear anti-correlation between
the spike amplitudes and stellar mass and possibly a correlation with stellar
age, consistent with the dynamo-generated magnetic fields theory in
(sub)-surface convective layers. Investigating the harmonic behaviour, we find
that for 125 stars neither of the two possible explanations can be excluded.
While our results suggest that the dynamo-generated magnetic field scenario is
more likely to explain the \textit{spike} feature, we assess further work is
needed to distinguish between the two scenarios. One method for ruling out one
of the two explanations is to directly observe magnetic fields in \textit{hump
\& spike} stars. Another would be to impose additional constraints through
detailed modelling of our stars, regarding the rotation requirement in the OsC
mode scenario or the presence of a convective-core (stellar age).

with the underlying mush complexes (MC) to constrain the axial topography of

MORs is recognized as the crucial factor in modulating their axial high versus
flat topography. Based on a two-step viscosity calculation (suspension and
solid-melt mixture rheology), we provide a theoretical estimate of $\mu_{eff}$
as a function of melt suspension characteristics (crystal content,
polymodality, polydispersity and strain-rate), and its volume fraction in the
MC region. We then develop a numerical model to show the control of $\mu_{eff}$
on the axial topography. Using an enthalpy-porosity-based fluid-formulation of
uppermost mantle the model implements a one-way fluid-structure interaction
(FSI) that transmits viscous forces of the MC region to the overlying upper
crust. The limiting non-rifted topographic elevations (-0.06 km to 1.27 km) of
model MORs are found to occur in the viscosity range: $\mu_{eff}$ = $10^{12}$
to $10^{14}$ Pa s. The higher-end ($10^{13}$ to $10^{14}$) Pa s of this
spectrum produce axial highs, which are replaced by flat or slightly negative

certain class of analytic functionals to show that the OPE coefficient squared
$c^2_{\phi \phi T^{\mu \nu}}$ must be exponentially small in $D$. For this to

$2\Delta_\phi$. Our argument is robust and can be applied to any OPE

the perception of waiting time variability for ride-hailing services. We
carried out a stated preference survey in August 2021, yielding 936 valid
responses. The respondents were faced with static pre-trip information on the
expected waiting time, followed by the actually experienced waiting time for
their selected alternative. We analyse this data by means of an instance-based
learning (IBL) approach to evaluate how individuals respond to service
performance variation and how this impacts their future decisions. Different
novel specifications of memory fading, captured by the IBL approach, are tested
to uncover which describes the user behaviour best. Additionally, existing and
new specification of inertia (habit) are tested. Our model outcomes reveal that
the perception of unexpected waiting time is within the expected range of 2-3
times the value-of-time. Travellers seem to place a higher reward on an early
departure compared to a penalty for a late departure of equal magnitude. A
cancelled service, after having made a booking, results in significant
disutility for the passenger and a strong motivation to shift to a different
provider. Considering memory decay, our results show that the most recent
experience is by far the most relevant for the next decision, with memories
fading quickly in importance. The role of inertia seems to gain importance with
each additional consecutive choice for the same option, but then resetting back
to zero following a shift in behaviour.

for vehicle CAN-data that identifies common driving events in an unsupervised
manner. The approach builds on self-supervised learning (SSL) for multivariate
time series to distinguish different driving events in the learned latent
space. We evaluate our approach with a dataset of real Tesla Model 3 vehicle
CAN-data and a two-hour driving session that we annotated with different
driving events. With our approach, we evaluate the applicability of recent time
series-related contrastive and generative SSL techniques to learn
representations that distinguish driving events. Compared to state-of-the-art

contrastive learning approaches reach similar performance.

mid-infrared spectrum of the rovibrational $\nu_3$ band has been recorded by
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy using a globar source on the AILES
beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron facility. The spectrum reveals hot bands
involving up to 5 quanta of excitation in $\nu_2$. From combining analyses of
all the presently recorded spectra and literature data, accurate rotational
parameters and absolute energy levels of C$_3$, in particular for states

all available data involving the X and A states (literature and present study)

type exoplanet $\tau$ Bo\""otis b was recently reported by Turner et al. (2021).
The magnetic field was inferred from observations of circularly-polarized radio
emission obtained with the LOFAR telescopes. The radio emission is possibly a
consequence of the interaction of the surrounding stellar wind with the
planet's magnetic field. Methods: We perform magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
the space environment around $\tau$ Bo\""otis b and its interaction with the
stellar wind using the PLUTO code. We study the magnetospheric energy fluxes
and effects of different magnetic field orientations in order to understand the
physical processes which cause energy fluxes leading to the observed radio
emission given the proposed magnetic field strength in Turner et al. (2021).
Furthermore we study the effect of stellar wind density and pressure on
magnetospheric energy fluxes given the uncertainty of extrasolar stellar wind
predictions. Results: We find in our simulations that the interaction is most
likely super--Alfv\'enic and energy fluxes generated by the stellar
wind--planet interaction are consistent with the observed radio powers.
Magnetospheric Poynting fluxes are of the order of 1-8 $\times10^{18}$ W for
open, semi-open and closed magnetospheres. The Poynting fluxes are
energetically consistent with the radio powers in Turner et al. (2021) for a
magnetospheric Poynting flux-to-radio efficiency $> 10^{-3}$ when the magnetic
fields of the planet and star are aligned. In case of lower efficiency factors
the magnetospheric emission scenario is according to the parameter space
modeled in this study not powerful enough. In case of a magnetic polarity
reversal of the host star towards an anti-aligned field configuration, expected
radio powers in the magnetospheric emission scenario fall below the observable
threshold.

complex blocks (GinSE, denoting Ginibre symplectic ensemble) are considered.
The eigenvalues of both GinOE and GinSE form Pfaffian point processes, which
are more complicated than the determinantal point processes resulting from
GinUE. Nevertheless, many of the obstacles that have slowed progress on the
development of traditional aspects of the theory have now been overcome, while
new theoretical aspects and new applications have been identified. This permits
a comprehensive account of themes addressed too in the complex case: eigenvalue
probability density functions and correlation functions, limit formulas for
correlation functions, fluctuation formulas, sum rules, gap probabilities and
eigenvector statistics, among others. Distinct from the complex case is the
need to develop a theory of skew orthogonal polynomials corresponding to the
skew inner product associated with the Pfaffian. Another distinct theme is the
statistics of real eigenvalues, which is unique to GinOE. These appear in a
number of applications of the theory, coming from areas as diverse as diffusion
processes and persistence in statistical physics, topologically driven
parametric energy level crossings for certain quantum dots, and equilibria

performance of wireless networks. Unfortunately, RIS also multiplies the number
of Channel State Information (CSI) coefficients between the transmitter and

channel state information. Furthermore, the simplicity and cost-effectiveness
of the passive RIS also implies that the incoming links are not locally

  Coefficients of a Polynomial","51 pages, comments welcome!",,,,"math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In chromatic homotopy theory, there is a well-known conjecture called
blue-shift phenomenon (BSP). Recently, Balmer-Sanders and
Barthel-Hausmann-Naumann-Nikolaus-Noel-Stapleton showed that a new BSP is
closely related to the Zariski topology of Balmer spectrum of the category of
compact genuine A-spectra for a finite abelian group A. To unify these two BSP
to one framework, we propose a general blue-shift phenomenon (GBSP) in this
paper and have a new idea to explain it in a more conceptual way. To carry out
our idea, we use the roots of p^j-series of formal group law of a complex
oriented spectrum E in the homotopy group of the generalized Tate spectrum of E
originally due to the seminal paper of Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel. This motivates us
to go further to study the relation of roots and coefficients of a polynomial
in a commutative ring R. And we propose a notion called n-tuple of a polynomial
in R to obtain generalized relations of roots and coefficients of this
polynomial in R. These generalized relations have a broad application prospect
in reducing the relations of R, especially they play an extremely important
role in explaining GBSP. By taking this brand-new approach, we successfully
achieve our idea of the explanation of GBSP for some abelian cases, and obtain
that the generalized Tate construction lowers Bousfield class along with many
Tate vanishing results. This strengthens and extends previous theorems of
Balmer-Sanders and Ando-Morava-Sadofsky. Though our approach could only recover
Barthel-Hausmann-Naumann-Nikolaus-Noel-Stapleton, it seems more accessible to
deal with GBSP for non-abelian cases. Besides, our approach greatly simplifies
the original proof of Bonventre-Guillou-Stapleton (arXiv:2204.03797), which
showed that its applications are not restricted to GBSP. Thus our approach
deserves more applications and further study.

technologies have led to data rich environments. In such environments, data can
easily be acquired not only from the monitored entities but also from the
surroundings where the entity is operating. The additional data that are
available from the problem domain, which cannot be used independently for
learning models, constitute context. Such context, if taken into account while
learning, can potentially improve the performance of predictive models.
Typically, the data from various sensors are present in the form of time
series. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are preferred for such data as it can
inherently handle temporal context. However, the conventional RNN models such
as Elman RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) in
their present form do not provide any mechanism to integrate explicit contexts.
In this paper, we propose a Context Integrated RNN (CiRNN) that enables
integrating explicit contexts represented in the form of contextual features.
In CiRNN, the network weights are influenced by contextual features in such a
way that the primary input features which are more relevant to a given context
are given more importance. To show the efficacy of CiRNN, we selected an
application domain, engine health prognostics, which captures data from various
sensors and where contextual information is available. We used the NASA
Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation dataset for estimating Remaining Useful
Life (RUL) as it provides contextual information. We compared CiRNN with
baseline models as well as the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental
results show an improvement of 39% and 87% respectively, over state-of-the art
models, when performance is measured with RMSE and score from an asymmetric
scoring function. The latter measure is specific to the task of RUL estimation.

the existing CIL models can achieve the optimal tradeoff in different
data-receiving settings--where typically the training-from-half (TFH) setting
needs more stability, but the training-from-scratch (TFS) needs more

Specifically, we first introduce the key hyperparameters that influence the
trade-off, e.g., knowledge distillation (KD) loss weights, learning rates, and
classifier types. Then, we formulate the hyperparameter optimization process as
an online Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and propose a specific

chemical abundances, which are thought to imprint the composition of planet
building blocks (PBBs). As such, the properties of stars should affect the
properties of planets and small bodies formed in their systems. In this
context, high-resolution spectroscopic surveys open a window into the chemical
links between and their host stars.
  Aims. We aim to determine the PBB composition trends for various stellar
populations across the Galaxy by comparing the two large spectroscopic surveys
APOGEE and GALAH. We assess the reliability of the PBB composition as
determined with these surveys with a propagation error study.
  Methods. Stellar spectroscopic abundances from the large surveys GALAH-DR3
and APOGEE-DR17 were used as input with a stoichiometric condensation model. We
classified stars into different Galactic components and we quantified the PBB
composition trends as a function of [Fe/H]. We also analysed the distribution
composition patterns in the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] diagram.
  Results. Our propagation error study suggests that the overall trends with
[Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] are robust, which is supported by the double study of
both APOGEE and GALAH. We therefore confirm the existence of a bimodal PBB
composition separating the thin disc stars from the thick disc stars.
Furthermore, we confirm that the stoichiometric water PBB content is
anti-correlated with [Fe/H].
  Conclusions. Our results imply that metal-poor stars both in the thin and
thick disks are suitable hosts for water-rich PBBs and for ice-rich small
bodies. However, for metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<0), the PBBs around thick disc
stars should have a higher water content than that around thin disc stars
because of the $\alpha$-contentdependence of the water mass fraction.

we find constraints for the involved parameters, namely, the throat radius, the
scale associated to the matter distribution, and the spacetime dimension, to
build those wormholes. Following, we study the properties of the obtained
solutions, namely, embedding diagrams as well as Weak and Null Energy
Conditions (WEC and NEC). We show that the larger the dimension, the larger the
flatness of the wormhole and the more pronounced the violation of these energy
conditions. We also show that the corresponding fluid behaves as phantom-like
for $d \geq 4$ in the neighborhood of the wormhole throat. In addition, we
specialize the employed model for $d=4$ spacetime, associating it with the
gravitational analog of the Schwinger effect in a vacuum and correcting the
model by introducing a minimal length via Generalized Uncertainty Principle
(GUP). Thus, we obtain a novel traversable and asymptotically flat wormhole
solution by considering that the minimal length is very tiny. The associated
embedding diagram shows us that the presence of this fundamental quantity
increases the slope of the wormhole towards its throat compared with the case
without it. That correction also attenuates the WEC (and NEC) violations nearby
the throat, with the fluid ceasing to be a phantom-type at the Planck scale,

an interpretable and versatile model of it. Timed discrete event systems are a
kind of model that respond to these requirements. However, such models can be
inferred from timestamped event sequences but not directly from numerical data.
To solve this problem, a discretization step must be done to identify events or
symbols in the time series. Persist is a discretization method that intends to
create persisting symbols by using a score called persistence score. This
allows to mitigate the risk of undesirable symbol changes that would lead to a
too complex model. After the study of the persistence score, we point out that
it tends to favor excessive cases making it miss interesting persisting
symbols. To correct this behavior, we replace the metric used in the
persistence score, the Kullback-Leibler divergence, with the Wasserstein
distance. Experiments show that the improved persistence score enhances
Persist's ability to capture the information of the original time series and
that it makes it better suited for discrete event systems learning.

addressed using multiple imputation. Although traditional imputation methods
allow for valid statistical inference when data are missing at random (MAR),
their implementation is problematic when the presence of missingness depends on
unobserved variables, i.e. the data are missing not at random (MNAR).
Unfortunately, this MNAR situation is rather common, in observational studies,
registries and other sources of real-world data. While several imputation
methods have been proposed for addressing individual studies when data are
MNAR, their application and validity in large datasets with multilevel
structure remains unclear. We therefore explored the consequence of MNAR data
in hierarchical data in-depth, and proposed a novel multilevel imputation
method for common missing patterns in clustered datasets. This method is based
on the principles of Heckman selection models and adopts a two-stage
meta-analysis approach to impute binary and continuous variables that may be
outcomes or predictors and that are systematically or sporadically missing.
After evaluating the proposed imputation model in simulated scenarios, we
illustrate it use in a cross-sectional community survey to estimate the
prevalence of malaria parasitemia in children aged 2-10 years in five

pseudorandom domain names using Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs). A cyber
criminal can register such domains to establish periodically changing
rendezvous points with the bots. DGAs make use of seeds to generate sets of
domains. Seeds can easily be changed in order to generate entirely new groups
of domains while using the same underlying algorithm. While this requires very
little manual effort for an adversary, security specialists typically have to
manually reverse engineer new malware strains to reconstruct the seeds. Only
when the seed and DGA are known, past and future domains can be generated,
efficiently attributed, blocked, sinkholed or used for a take-down. Common
counters in the literature consist of databases or Machine Learning (ML) based
detectors to keep track of past and future domains of known DGAs and to
identify DGA-generated domain names, respectively. However, database based
approaches can not detect domains generated by new DGAs, and ML approaches can
not generate future domain names. In this paper, we introduce SESAME, a system
that combines the two above-mentioned approaches and contains a module for
automatic Seed Reconstruction, which is, to our knowledge, the first of its
kind. It is used to automatically classify domain names, rate their novelty,
and determine the seeds of the underlying DGAs. SESAME consists of multiple
DGA-specific Seed Reconstructors and is designed to work purely based on domain
names, as they are easily obtainable from observing the network traffic. We
evaluated our approach on 20.8 gigabytes of DNS-lookups. Thereby, we identified
17 DGAs, of which 4 were entirely new to us.

(MIS) on a general $n$-vertex graph. Each vertex has a binary state, black or
white, where black indicates inclusion into the MIS. The vertex states are
arbitrary initially, and are updated in parallel: In each round, every vertex
whose state is ``inconsistent'' with its neighbors', i.e., it is black and has
a black neighbor, or it is white and all neighbors are white, changes its state
with probability $1/2$. The process stabilizes with probability 1 on any graph,
and the resulting set of black vertices is an MIS. It is also easy to see that
the expected stabilization time is $O(\log n)$ on certain graph families, such
as cliques and trees. However, analyzing the process on graphs beyond these
simple cases seems challenging.
  Our main result is that the process stabilizes in $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$
rounds w.h.p.\ on $G_{n,p}$ random graphs, for $0\leq p \leq \mathrm{poly}(\log
n)\cdot n^{-1/2}$ and $p \geq 1/\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$. Further, an extension
of this process, with larger but still constant vertex state space, stabilizes
in $\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ rounds on $G_{n,p}$ w.h.p., for all $1\leq p\leq 1$.
We conjecture that this improved bound holds for the original process as well.
In fact, we believe that the original process stabilizes in $\mathrm{poly}(\log
n)$ rounds on any given $n$-vertex graph w.h.p. Both processes readily
translate into distributed/parallel MIS algorithms, which are self-stabilizing,
use constant space (and constant random bits per round), and assume restricted
communication as in the beeping or the synchronous stone age models. To the
best of our knowledge, no previously known MIS algorithm is self-stabilizing,
uses constant space and constant randomness, and stabilizes in
$\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ rounds in general or random graphs.

$\alpha\omega$-dynamo process, in which a combination of differential rotation
and turbulent, helical flows produces a large-scale magnetic field that
reverses every 11 years. Most $\alpha\omega$ solar dynamo models rely on
differential rotation in the solar tachocline to generate a strong toroidal
field. The most problematic part of such models is then the production of the
large-scale poloidal field, via a process known as the $\alpha$-effect. Whilst
this is usually attributed to small-scale convective motions under the
influence of rotation, the efficiency of this regenerative process has been
called into question by some numerical simulations. Motivated by likely
conditions within the tachocline, the aim of this paper is to investigate an
alternative mechanism for the poloidal field regeneration, namely the magnetic
buoyancy instability in a shear-generated, rotating magnetic layer. We use a
local, fully compressible model in which an imposed vertical shear winds up an
initially vertical magnetic field. The field ultimately becomes buoyantly
unstable, and we measure the resulting mean electromotive force (EMF). For
sufficiently rapid rotation, we find that a significant component of the mean
EMF is aligned with the direction of the mean magnetic field, which is the
characteristic feature of the classical $\alpha\omega$-dynamo model. Our
results therefore suggest that magnetic buoyancy could contribute directly to
the generation of large-scale poloidal field in the Sun.

Simple thermal models are a commonly used method for determining these
properties, however they have inherent limitations due to the simplifying
assumptions they make about asteroid shapes and properties. With the recent
collapse of the Arecibo Telescope and a decrease of direct size measurements,
as well as future facilities such as LSST and NEO Surveyor coming online soon,
these models will play an increasingly important role in our knowledge of the
NEA population. Therefore, it is key to understand the limits of these models.
In this work we constrain the limitations of simple thermal models by comparing
model results to more complex thermophysical models, radar data, and other
existing analyses. Furthermore, we present a method for placing tighter
constraints on inferred NEA properties using simple thermal models. These
comparisons and constraints are explored using the NEA (285263) 1998 QE2 as a

offset between the nodes in a distributed network of diameter $D$ and size $n$.
They achieve optimal offsets of $\Theta(\log D)$ locally, i.e. between adjacent
nodes as shown by Lenzen et al., and $\Theta(D)$ globally as shown by Biaz and
Welch. As demonstrated in the work of Bund et al., this is a highly promising
approach for improved clocking schemes for large-scale synchronous
Systems-on-Chip (SoC). Unfortunately, in large systems, faults hinder their
practical use. State of the art fault-tolerant, as presented by Bund et al.,
has a drawback that is fatal in this setting: It relies on node and edge
replication. For $f=1$, this translates to at least $16$-fold edge replication
and high degree nodes, far from the optimum of $2f+1=3$ for tolerating up to
$f$ faulty neighbors.
  In this work, we present a self-stabilizing GCS algorithm for a grid-like
directed graph with optimal node in- and out-degrees of $3$ that tolerates $1$
faulty in-neighbor. If nodes fail with independent probability $p\in
o(n^{-1/2})$, it achieves asymptotically optimal local skew of $\Theta(\log D)$
with probability $1-o(1)$; this holds under general worst-case assumptions on
link delay and clock speed variations, provided they change slowly relative to
the speed of the system. The failure probability is the largest possible
ensuring that with probabity $1-o(1)$ for each node at most one in-neighbor
fails. As modern hardware is clocked at gigahertz speeds and the algorithm can
simultaneously sustain a constant number of arbitrary changes due to faults in
each clock cycle, this results in sufficient robustness to dramatically
increase the size of reliable synchronously clocked SoCs.

uncertain systems with partially observed states. We consider a non-stochastic
model, where uncontrolled disturbances acting on the system take values in
bounded sets with unknown distributions. We present a general framework for
decision-making in such problems by developing the notions of information
states and approximate information states. In our definition of an information
state, we introduce conditions to identify for an uncertain variable sufficient
to construct a dynamic program (DP) that computes an optimal strategy. We show
that many information states from the literature on worst-case control actions,
e.g., the conditional range, are examples of our more general definition. Next,
we relax these conditions to define approximate information states using only
output variables, which can be learned from output data without knowledge of
system dynamics. We use this notion to formulate an approximate DP that yields
a strategy with a bounded performance loss. Finally, we illustrate the
application of our results in control and reinforcement learning using
numerical examples.

that achieve vanishing probabilities of error over the binary symmetric channel
(which causes bit-flip errors) and the binary erasure channel, constrained
subcodes of such linear codes are also resilient to random bit-flip errors and

the utility of our method in providing explicit values or efficient algorithms

indicator function of the constraint is computable, for different constraints.
Our second approach is to obtain good upper bounds, using an extension of
Delsarte's linear program (LP), on the largest sizes of constrained codes that
can correct a fixed number of combinatorial errors or erasures. We observe that
the numerical values of our LP-based upper bounds beat the generalized sphere

climate change was not influential, what factors were important for predicting
financial wellbeing of the farm. And third, ascertain whether observed effects
on the financial wellbeing of the farm were a result of interactions between

mechanical compliance of the thermal diode is poor, which prevents its intimate
contact with heat source or sink surfaces, the thermal rectification
performance cannot be used to its full extent. In this work, we introduce a
heterojunction thermal diode made of a phase change material (PCM) consisting
of dual alkanes (hexadecane and paraffine wax) and polyurethane. The fabricated
thermal diode exhibits an ultra soft mechanical feature, with a low elastic
modulus of 0.4 KPa and larger than 300% elongation until failure: the best
values reported to date for thermal diodes. The measured thermal rectification
factor is as high as 1.42 that in line with the theoretical model prediction.
Molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the thermal rectification mechanism
of the PCM based thermal diode originates from the crystal-amorphous phase
transition of the hexadecane terminal as the temperature bias flips. Therefore,
the heat flow in the forward direction is greater than the flux in the reverse
direction. A series of experiments and finite element analyses are employed to
verify the feasibility of thermal diodes for applications. Our results
demonstrate that the fabricated thermal diode can be potentially used in

optoelectronic oscillator (OEO), offer the potential for realization of phase
noise levels orders of magnitude lower than achievable by conventional
microwave sources. Fibre optic-based delay lines can realize the large delay
required for low phase noise systems whilst simultaneously achieving insertion
loss levels that can be compensated by available microwave and photonic
amplification technologies. However, the long fibre is vulnerable to
environmental perturbations such as mechanical vibrations and variations in
ambient temperature, which result in short term fluctuations and thermally
induced drift of the oscillation frequency. The phase shifter used
conventionally to adjust the frequency of an OEO to enable phase lock has a
finite range that is insufficient to compensate the delay change resulting from
operational temperature ranges. A solution to continuous tuning without
mode-hopping and to compensation of thermally induced frequency drift without
loss of lock of a time delay oscillator is proposed. The basic concept is to
introduce a tuning mechanism that works with Cartesian co-ordinates on the
complex plane and to avoid explicit use of polar co-ordinates. Consequently,
the transmission of the tuning component may traverse the unit circle in either
direction multiple times without range limitation to the phase. Thereby tuning
by mode-hopping is avoided and expedients to stabilisation, such as the use of
tunable lasers within a control loop or precision temperature stabilisation
measures are not required. The concept is verified by Simulink simulations. The
method has been experimentally tested successfully using a prototype OEO phase
locked to a system reference. Solid lock was maintained even when the OEO was
placed in an oven and cycled over a temperature range from ambient to 80
{\deg}C.

variants or modify query responses for specific variants (e.g., adding noise,
as in differential privacy). However, many of these approaches result in a
significant utility loss, either suppressing many variants or adding a
substantial amount of noise. In this paper, we introduce optimization-based
approaches to explicitly trade off the utility of summary data or Beacon
responses and privacy with respect to membership-inference attacks based on
likelihood-ratios, combining variant suppression and modification. We consider
two attack models. In the first, an attacker applies a likelihood-ratio test to
make membership-inference claims. In the second model, an attacker uses a
threshold that accounts for the effect of the data release on the separation in
scores between individuals in the dataset and those who are not. We further
introduce highly scalable approaches for approximately solving the
privacy-utility tradeoff problem when information is either in the form of
summary statistics or presence/absence queries. Finally, we show that the
proposed approaches outperform the state of the art in both utility and privacy
through an extensive evaluation with public datasets.

using neural ordinary differential equations as building blocks. We replace the
Helmholtz free energy function and the dissipation potential with data-driven
functions that a priori satisfy physics-based constraints such as objectivity
and the second law of thermodynamics. Our approach enables modeling
viscoelastic behavior of materials under arbitrary loads in three-dimensions
even with large deformations and large deviations from the thermodynamic
equilibrium. The data-driven nature of the governing potentials endows the
model with much needed flexibility in modeling the viscoelastic behavior of a
wide class of materials. We train the model using stress-strain data from
biological and synthetic materials including humain brain tissue, blood clots,
natural rubber and human myocardium and show that the data-driven method
outperforms traditional, closed-form models of viscoelasticity.

action-centric task graphs. Learnt structured representations from our method,
Action Dynamics Task Graphs (ADTG), can then be used for understanding such
tasks in unseen videos of humans performing them. Furthermore, ADTG can enable
providing user-centric guidance to humans in these tasks, either for performing
them better or for learning new tasks. Specifically, we show how ADTG can be
used for: (1) tracking an ongoing task, (2) recommending next actions, and (3)
planning a sequence of actions to accomplish a procedural task. We compare
against state-of-the-art Neural Task Graph method and demonstrate substantial
gains on 18 procedural tasks from the CrossTask dataset, including 30.1%
improvement in task tracking accuracy and 20.3% accuracy gain in next action
prediction.

  Challenges and Motivations","Review",,,,"cs.DC cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A smart contract is a digital program of transaction protocol (rules of
contract) based on the consensus architecture of blockchain. Smart contracts
with Blockchain are modern technologies that have gained enormous attention in
scientific and practical applications. A smart contract is the central aspect
of a blockchain that facilitates blockchain as a platform outside the
cryptocurrency spectrum. The development of blockchain technology, with a focus
on smart contracts, has advanced significantly in recent years. However
research on the smart contract idea has weaknesses in the implementation
sectors based on a decentralized network that shares an identical state. This
paper extensively reviews smart contracts based on multi criteria analysis
challenges and motivations. Therefore, implementing blockchain in
multi-criteria research is required to increase the efficiency of interaction
between users via supporting information exchange with high trust. Implementing
blockchain in the multi-criteria analysis is necessary to increase the
efficiency of interaction between users via supporting information exchange and
with high confidence, detecting malfunctioning, helping users with performance
issues, reaching a consensus, deploying distributed solutions and allocating
plans, tasks and joint missions. The smart contract with decision-making
performance, planning and execution improves the implementation based on
efficiency, sustainability and management.
  Furthermore the uncertainty and supply chain performance lead to improved
users confidence in offering new solutions in exchange for problems in smart
contacts. Evaluation includes code analysis and performance while development
performance can be under development.

applied in a wide range of sciences. However it is not compatible with short
pulse lasers, because it is limited with monochromatic illumination. Although
there have been reports on the broadband CDI, the band-width is limited with
10% for robust imaging. In this article, we report a algorithm which is able to
CDI robustly with at least 80% bandwidth. This algorithm is apply to published
experiment data and simulated ultra-broadband data to demonstrate its ability.
This technique enables us to capture the non-repeatable transient dynamics as
short as the laser pulse width, which is one step forward to the ultra-fast
CDI.

retarded. This leads to the concept of a relativistic engine resulting from
retardation of electromagnetic fields. We have shown that Newton'n third law
cannot strictly hold in a distributed system, where the different parts are at
a finite distance from each other and thus force imbalance is created at the
system's center of mass. As the system is affected by a total force for a
finite period, mechanical momentum and energy are acquired by the system. In
previous works we relied on the fact that the bodies were macroscopically
natural. Lately we relaxed this assumption and studied charged bodies, thus
analyzing the consequences on a possible electric relativistic engine. On the
first paper on this subject we investigated this phenomena in general but gave
an example of a system only at the stage of reaching a stationary state, a
second paper was devoted to the same but on the atomic scale, here we shall
analyze the charge relativistic engine in a general time dependent setting.

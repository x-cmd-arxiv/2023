automated program repair techniques have been introduced. Given a test suite,
standard methods usually either synthesize a repair, or navigate a search space
of software edits to find test-suite passing variants. Recent program repair
methods are based on deep learning approaches. One of these novel methods,
which is not primarily intended for automated program repair, but is still
suitable for it, is ChatGPT. The bug fixing performance of ChatGPT, however, is
so far unclear. Therefore, in this paper we evaluate ChatGPT on the standard
bug fixing benchmark set, QuixBugs, and compare the performance with the
results of several other approaches reported in the literature. We find that
ChatGPT's bug fixing performance is competitive to the common deep learning
approaches CoCoNut and Codex and notably better than the results reported for
the standard program repair approaches. In contrast to previous approaches,
ChatGPT offers a dialogue system through which further information, e.g., the
expected output for a certain input or an observed error message, can be
entered. By providing such hints to ChatGPT, its success rate can be further
increased, fixing 31 out of 40 bugs, outperforming state-of-the-art.

traffic signal control, transportation project prioritization, road maintenance

manual counting, video cameras, and loop detectors at a limited number of
locations. These efforts require significant labor and cost for expansions.
Researchers and private sector companies have also explored alternative
solutions such as probe vehicle data, while still suffering from a low
penetration rate. In recent years, along with the technological advancement in
mobile sensors and mobile networks, Mobile Device Location Data (MDLD) have
been growing dramatically in terms of the spatiotemporal coverage of the
population and its mobility. This paper presents a big-data driven framework
that can ingest terabytes of MDLD and estimate vehicle volume at a larger
geographical area with a larger sample size. The proposed framework first
employs a series of cloud-based computational algorithms to extract multimodal
trajectories and trip rosters. A scalable map matching and routing algorithm is
then applied to snap and route vehicle trajectories to the roadway network. The
observed vehicle counts on each roadway segment are weighted and calibrated
against ground truth control totals, i.e., Annual Vehicle-Miles of Travel

implemented on the all-street network in the state of Maryland using MDLD for
the entire year of 2019. Results indicate that our proposed framework produces
reliable vehicle volume estimates and also demonstrate its transferability and
the generalization ability.

have been of interest in recent years. These networks are often characterized
by the presence of complex structures such as central loops paired with
peripheral branches, which can appear both in natural and man-made systems,
such as subway and railway networks. In this study, we investigate the
conditions for the emergence of these non-trivial topological structures in the
context of human transportation in cities. We propose a minimal model for
spatial networks generation, where a network lattice acts as a spatial
substrate and edge velocities and distances define an effective temporal
distance which quantifies the efficiency in exploring the urban space. Complex
network topologies can be recovered from the optimization of joint network
paths and we study how the interplay between a flow probability between two
nodes in space and the associated travel cost influences the resulting optimal
network. In the perspective of urban transportation we simulate these flows by
means of human mobility models to obtain Origin-Destination matrices. We find
that when using simple lattices, the obtained optimal topologies transition
from tree-like structures to more regular networks, depending on the spatial
range of flows. Remarkably, we find that branches paired to large loops
structures appear as optimal structures when the network is optimized for an
interplay between heterogeneous mobility patterns of small range travels and
longer range ones typical of commuting. Finally, we show that our framework is
able to recover the statistical spatial properties of the Greater London Area

Metamorphic testing needs no labeled input/output examples. Instead, the
program is executed multiple times, first on a given (randomly generated)

analyze how the generalizability depends on the number of given labeled

conventionally observed at liquid-helium temperatures, where lattice vibrations
are strongly suppressed and bulk carrier scattering is dominated by disorder.
However, due to large Landau level (LL) separation (~2000 K at B = 30 T),
graphene can support the QH effect up to room temperature (RT), concomitant
with a non-negligible population of acoustic phonons with a wave-vector
commensurate to the inverse electronic magnetic length. Here, we demonstrate
that graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) realizes a novel
transport regime, where dissipation in the QH phase is governed predominantly
by electron-phonon scattering. Investigating thermally-activated transport at
filling factor 2 up to RT in an ensemble of back-gated devices, we show that
the high B-field behaviour correlates with their zero B-field transport
mobility. By this means, we extend the well-accepted notion of phonon-limited
resistivity in ultra-clean graphene to a hitherto unexplored high-field realm.

up for debate. Kinematic differences between the populations are particularly
interesting in this respect, because they allow us to distinguish between
single-epoch formation scenarios and multi-epoch formation scenarios. We
analyze the kinematics of 25 globular clusters and aim to find kinematic
differences between multiple populations to constrain their formation process.
We split red-giant branch (RGB) stars in each cluster into three populations
(P1, P2, P3) for the type-II clusters and two populations (P1 and P2) otherwise
using Hubble photometry. We derive the rotation and dispersion profiles for
each cluster and its populations by using all stars with radial velocity
measurements obtained from MUSE spectroscopy. Based on these profiles, we
calculate the rotation strength in terms of ordered-over-random motion
$\left(v/\sigma\right)_\mathrm{HL}$ evaluated at the half-light radius of the
cluster. We detect rotation in all but four clusters. For NGC~104, NGC~1851,
NGC~2808, NGC~5286, NGC~5904, NGC~6093, NGC~6388, NGC~6541, NGC~7078 and

and NGC~7078 we find differences in $\left(v/\sigma\right)_\mathrm{HL}$ between
P1 and P2 that are larger than $1\sigma$. Whereas we find that P2 rotates
faster than P1 for NGC~6093 and NGC~7078, the opposite is true for NGC~2808.
However, even for these three clusters, the differences are still of low
significance. We find that the strength of rotation of a cluster generally
scales with its median relaxation time. For P1 and P2, the corresponding
relation is very weak at best. We observe no correlation between the difference
in rotation strength between P1 and P2 and cluster relaxation time. The MUSE
stellar radial velocities that this analysis is based on are made publicly

$b$-matching, exposed node-by-node on one side. The objective is to maximize
the \emph{rounding ratio} of the output matching $\mathcal{M}$, which is the
minimum over all fractional $b$-matchings $\mathbf{x}$, and edges $e$, of the

schemes achieving a ratio of one and strong negative correlation properties are
known (e.g., Gandhi et al., J.ACM'06 and Chekuri et al., FOCS'10), and have
found numerous applications. Motivated by online applications, we present
\emph{online dependent-rounding schemes} (ODRSes) for $b$-matching.
  For the special case of uniform matroids (single offline node), we present a
simple online algorithm with a rounding ratio of one. Interestingly, we show
that our algorithm yields \emph{the same distribution} as its classic offline
counterpart, pivotal sampling (Srinivasan, FOCS'01), and so inherits the
latter's strong correlation properties. In arbitrary bipartite graphs, an
online rounding ratio of one is impossible, and we show that a combination of
our uniform matroid ODRS with repeated invocations of \emph{offline} contention
resolution schemes (CRSes) yields a rounding ratio of $1-1/e\approx 0.632$. Our
main technical contribution is an ODRS breaking this pervasive bound, yielding
rounding ratios of $0.646$ and $0.652$ for $b$-matchings and simple matchings,

(ordinary) differential equations under uncertainty, with almost sure
constraints on the state variable. To alleviate the computational burden of
high-dimensional random variables, we approximate all random fields by the
tensor-train decomposition. To enable efficient tensor-train approximation of
the state constraints, the latter are handled using the Moreau-Yosida penalty,
with an additional smoothing of the positive part (plus/ReLU) function by a
softplus function. We derive theoretical bounds on the constraint violation in
terms of the Moreau-Yosida regularization parameter and smoothing width of the
softplus function. This result also proposes a practical recipe for selecting
these two parameters. When the optimization problem is strongly convex, we
establish strong convergence of the regularized solution to the optimal
control. We develop a second order Newton type method with a fast matrix-free
action of the approximate Hessian to solve the smoothed Moreau-Yosida problem.
This algorithm is tested on benchmark elliptic problems with random
coefficients, optimization problems constrained by random elliptic variational
inequalities, and a real-world epidemiological model with 20 random variables.
These examples demonstrate mild (at most polynomial) scaling with respect to
the dimension and regularization parameters.

partially lifting the degeneracy within a given LL while inter-LL interactions

light is spectrally-dispersed and then recombined into white-light flux. We do
this by combining the dgvAPP360 with the infrared ALES integral field
spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer. To demonstrate,
we observed the red companion HD 1160 B (separation ~780 mas) for one night,

channels spanning 3.59-3.99 $\mu$m further show tentative evidence of
increasing variability with wavelength. We find no evidence yet of a systematic

analysing multiple large-scale structure surveys jointly. Our inferred values
for $S_8$ fall below the value inferred from the CMB, $S_8 = 0.834 \pm 0.016$.
While this difference is not statistically significant by itself, our results
mirror other findings in the literature whereby low-redshift large scale
structure probes infer lower values for $S_8$ than the CMB, the so-called
$S_8$-tension.

forward operator involving an unknown function. The problem arises in diverse
applications and is challenging in the presence of an unknown function, which
makes it ill-posed. Additionally, the nonlinear nature of the problem makes it
difficult to use traditional methods, and thus, the study addresses a
simplified version of the problem by either linearizing it or assuming
knowledge of the unknown function. Here, we propose self-supervised learning to
directly tackle a nonlinear inverse problem involving an unknown function. In
particular, we focus on an inverse problem derived in photoacoustic tomograpy
(PAT), which is a hybrid medical imaging with high resolution and contrast. PAT
can be modeled based on the wave equation. The measured data provide the
solution to an equation restricted to surface and initial pressure of an
equation that contains biological information on the object of interest. The
speed of a sound wave in the equation is unknown. Our goal is to determine the
initial pressure and the speed of the sound wave simultaneously. Under a simple
assumption that sound speed is a function of the initial pressure, the problem
becomes a nonlinear inverse problem involving an unknown function. The
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework performs
successfully.

result in model placements that train fast on data (i.e., low step times),
learning-based model-parallelism is time-consuming, taking many hours or days
to create a placement plan of operators on devices. We present the Baechi
system, the first to adopt an algorithmic approach to the placement problem for
running machine learning training graphs on small clusters of
memory-constrained devices. We integrate our implementation of Baechi into two
popular open-source learning frameworks: TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our
experimental results using GPUs show that: (i) Baechi generates placement plans
654 X - 206K X faster than state-of-the-art learning-based approaches, and (ii)
Baechi-placed model's step (training) time is comparable to expert placements
in PyTorch, and only up to 6.2% worse than expert placements in TensorFlow. We
prove mathematically that our two algorithms are within a constant factor of
the optimal. Our work shows that compared to learning-based approaches,
algorithmic approaches can face different challenges for adaptation to Machine
learning systems, but also they offer proven bounds, and significant
performance benefits.

candidates have shifted focus from primarily Weakly-Interacting Massive
Particles (WIMPs) to an entire suite of candidates with masses from the
zeV-scale to the PeV-scale to 30 solar masses. One particular recent
development has been searches for light dark matter (LDM), which is typically
defined as candidates with masses in the range of keV to GeV. In searches for
LDM, eV-scale and below detector thresholds are needed to detect the small
amount of kinetic energy that is imparted to nuclei in a recoil. One such
detector technology that can be applied to LDM searches is that of
Transition-Edge Sensors (TESs). Operated at cryogenic temperatures, these
sensors can achieve the required thresholds, depending on the optimization of
the design.
  In this thesis, I will motivate the evidence for DM and the various DM
candidates beyond the WIMP. I will then detail the basics of TES
characterization, expand and apply the concepts to an athermal phonon
sensor--based Cryogenic PhotoDetector (CPD), and use this detector to carry out
a search for LDM at the surface. The resulting exclusion analysis provides the
most stringent limits in DM-nucleon scattering cross section (comparing to
contemporary searches) for a cryogenic detector for masses from 93 to 140 MeV,
showing the promise of athermal phonon sensors in future LDM searches.
Furthermore, unknown excess background signals are observed in this LDM search,
for which I rule out various possible sources and motivate stress-related
microfractures as an intriguing explanation. Finally, I will shortly discuss
the outlook of future searches for LDM for various detection channels beyond
nuclear recoils.

been used to circumvent code signing in Android binaries, to coerce certificate

automatically detects blind spots. An efficient implementation is introduced
and evaluated against a corpus of over a thousand diverse PDFs parsed through
MuPDF, revealing exploitable bugs in the parser. All of the blind spot

changing the dielectric environment of light emitters. Generally cavities with
modes in resonance to light emission frequency, are used to amplify the light
emission rate. The Fermi golden rule predicts that if the cavity modes are
offresonant to the emission frequency, then the SE rate is suppressed. In this
study, we demonstrate that the SE of colloidal alloyed quantum dots is
inhibited by coupling them to chemically synthesized Silver nanowires and
Silver nanoplatelet systems. The silver nanoplatelet and silver nanowire
plasmonic resonance modes are in ultraviolet and infrared regions of the
electromagnetic spectrum. The quantum dots emit in visible region of light.
This off-resonant weak coupling of emitters and cavities results in emission
rate suppression and is quantified by time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL)

by coupling self assembled quantum dot monolayers to a single silver
nanoplatelet and a single silver nanowire respectively.

manipulated by driving the lattice coherently with optical and terahertz
pulses. New physical phenomena and non-equilibrium phases that have no
equilibrium counterpart have been discovered following these protocols. The
underlying structural dynamics has been mostly studied by recording the average
atomic position along dynamical structural coordinates with elastic scattering
methods. However, crystal lattice fluctuations, which are known to influence
phase transitions in equilibrium, are also expected to determine these dynamics
but have rarely been explored. Here, we study the driven dynamics of the
quantum paraelectric SrTiO3, in which mid-infrared drives have been shown to
induce a metastable ferroelectric state. Crucial in these physics is the
competition between the polar instability and antiferrodistortive rotations,
which in equilibrium frustrate the formation of long-range ferroelectricity. We
make use of high intensity mid-infrared optical pulses to resonantly drive a
Ti-O stretching mode at 17 THz, and we measure the resulting change in lattice
fluctuations using time-resolved x-ray diffuse scattering at a free electron
laser. After a prompt increase, we observe a long-lived quench in R-point
antiferrodistortive lattice fluctuations. The enhancement and reduction in
lattice fluctuations are explained theoretically by considering fourth-order
nonlinear phononic interactions and third-order coupling to the driven optical
phonon and to lattice strain, respectively. These observations provide a number
of new and testable hypotheses for the physics of light-induced
ferroelectricity.

generation as done in conventional genetic algorithms. Instead, it steers the
search with the complete population present at time of breeding new
individuals. We provide an MPI-based implementation of our algorithm, which
features variants of selection, mutation, crossover, and migration and is easy
to extend with custom functionality. We compare Propulate to the established
optimization tool Optuna. We find that Propulate is up to three orders of
magnitude faster without sacrificing solution accuracy, demonstrating the

investigated the existence of the wild microorganism in soil contaminated with
oil and study their ability to degrade petroleum in vitro. Nineteen samples
were collected from various locations near Taq Taq (TTOPCO) natural seeps in
the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Morphological, cultural, biochemical tests and
molecular identification were used to identify the microbial communities, in
addition, spore texture and the colour of the fungal isolates were investigated
on the fungal isolates. Out of the19 samples, 17 indigenous bacterial strains
and 5 fungal strains were successfully isolated. From the absorption
spectrophotometry, Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus cereus, Achromobacter sp. and
Pseudomonas aeruginosa for the bacterial isolates grew well on a minimal salt
medium supplemented with 1% crude oil. Results showed that these isolates
mentioned above had a strong ability to degrade crude oil by reducing the
colour of 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) from deep blue to colourless.
However, for the fractions of hydrocarbon, the bacterial isolates failed and
did not affect the colour of any of the fractions. The results for fungi showed
that Aspergillus lentulus and Rhizopus arrhizus had a strong ability to degrade
both crude oil and fraction F1 by reducing the colour of DCPIP. Each fungal
isolates also had a great tolerance to different concentrations of crude oil
when grown on solid MSM. This study showed these microorganisms have a strong
ability to degrade crude oil and can be used to clean up soil and the
environment.

point-to-point motion of a gantry crane system in the presence of uncertainties
in modal parameters. Assuming that the velocity of the trolley of the crane can
be commanded and is subject to limits, an optimal control problem is posed to
determine the bang-off-bang control profile to transition the system from a
point of rest to the terminal states with no residual vibrations. Both undamped
and underdamped systems are considered and the variation of the structure of
the optimal control profiles as a function of the final displacement is
studied. As the magnitude of the rigid body displacement is increased, the
collapse and birthing of switches in the optimal control profile are observed
and explained. Robustness to uncertainties in modal parameters is accounted for
by forcing the state sensitivities at the terminal time to zero. The
observation that the time-optimal control profile merges with the robust
time-optimal control is noted for specific terminal displacements and the
migration of zeros of the time-delay filter parameterizing the optimal control
profile are used to explain this counter intuitive result. A two degree of
freedom gantry crane system is used to experimentally validate the observations
of the numerical studies and the tradeoff of increase in maneuver time to the
reduction of residual vibrations is experimentally illustrated.

differential operators acting on smooth sections of vector bundles over
Riemannian manifolds is a central theme in global analysis, differential
geometry and mathematical physics. Instead of studying the spectrum of a
differential operator $L$ directly one usually studies its spectral functions,
that is, spectral traces of some functions of the operator, such as the
spectral zeta function $\zeta(s)=\Tr L^{-s}$ and the heat trace
$\Theta(t)=\Tr\exp(-tL)$. The kernel $U(t;x,x')$ of the heat semigroup
$\exp(-tL)$, called the heat kernel, plays a major role in quantum field theory
and quantum gravity, index theorems, non-commutative geometry, integrable
systems and financial mathematics. We review some recent progress in the study
of spectral asymptotics. We study more general spectral functions, such as $\Tr
f(tL)$, that we call quantum heat traces. Also, we define new invariants of
differential operators that depend not only on the their eigenvalues but also
on the eigenfunctions, and, therefore, contain much more information about the
geometry of the manifold. Furthermore, we study some new invariants, such as
$\Tr\exp(-tL_+)\exp(-sL_-)$, that contain relative spectral information of two
differential operators. Finally we show how the convolution of the semigroups
of two different operators can be computed by using purely algebraic methods.

several observational hints from background lights suggesting a DM in this mass
range, the hot DM scenario has been considered strongly in tension with the
structure formation of our Universe because the free-streaming length of the DM
produced from thermal reactions was thought to be too long. In this paper, I
show that the previous conclusions are not always true depending on the
reaction for bosonic DM because of the Bose-enhanced reaction at very low
momentum. By using the simple $1\leftrightarrow 2$ decay/inverse decay process
to produce the DM, I demonstrate that the eV range bosonic DM can be thermally
produced $coldly$ from a hot plasma by performing a model-independent analysis
applicable to axion, hidden photon, and other bosonic DM candidates. Therefore,
the bosonic DM in the eV mass range may still be special and theoretically

efforts focus primarily on pushing their accuracy to the state-of-the-art
level. However, their latency lags behind sparse convolution-based models (3x
slower), hindering their usage in resource-constrained, latency-sensitive
applications (such as autonomous driving). This inefficiency comes from point
clouds' sparse and irregular nature, whereas transformers are designed for
dense, regular workloads. This paper presents FlatFormer to close this latency
gap by trading spatial proximity for better computational regularity. We first
flatten the point cloud with window-based sorting and partition points into
groups of equal sizes rather than windows of equal shapes. This effectively
avoids expensive structuring and padding overheads. We then apply
self-attention within groups to extract local features, alternate sorting axis
to gather features from different directions, and shift windows to exchange
features across groups. FlatFormer delivers state-of-the-art accuracy on Waymo
Open Dataset with 4.6x speedup over (transformer-based) SST and 1.4x speedup
over (sparse convolutional) CenterPoint. This is the first point cloud
transformer that achieves real-time performance on edge GPUs and is faster than
sparse convolutional methods while achieving on-par or even superior accuracy
on large-scale benchmarks.

tremendous defense challenges in today's machine learning paradigm. In this
paper, we explore the potential of self-training via additional unlabeled data

vanilla self-training is not effective in backdoor mitigation. Spurred by that,
we propose to defend the backdoor attacks by leveraging strong but proper data
augmentations in the self-training pseudo-labeling stage. We find that the new
self-training regime help in defending against backdoor attacks to a great
extent. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments for different
backdoor triggers on CIFAR-10 and a combination of CIFAR-10 with an additional

combining self-supervised representation learning with self-training for

out of vacuum induced by the rapidly evolving Higgs field, which gets
exponentially enhanced due to the tachyonic instability. Such explosive
particle production can rapidly drain energy away from the Higgs field,
sustaining a significant density of Higgs particles even during inflation, and
could initiate a qualitatively different form of preheating in parts of the

particle energy density into account, which could significantly affect the
subsequent evolution of such systems. This could carry important implications
for high scale inflation, post-inflationary preheating, observable signals in
the cosmic microwave background, gravitational waves, and primordial black
holes, as well as deeper concepts ranging from eternal inflation to the
metastability of the electroweak vacuum.

a short period planet by its host star, affecting its derived density. We
extend the work of Burton et al., Correia, and others, using a gravitational
potential formulation to a sample of nearly 200 planets with periods less than
3 days. We find five planets exhibiting density variations of >10% and as many
as 20 planets with deviations >5%. We derive an analytic approximation for this
deviation as a function of the orbital period, transit depth, and mass ratio
between the planet and host star, allowing for rapid determination of such
tidal effects. We find that current density error bars are typically larger
than tidal deviations but that reducing the uncertainty on transit depth and
radial velocity (RV) amplitude by a factor of 3 causes tidal effects to
dominate density errors (>50%) in >40% of planets in our sample, implying that
in the near future upgraded observational precision will cause shape deviations
to become a bottleneck with regards to analysis of exoplanet compositions.
These two parameters are found to dominate uncertainties compared to errors on
stellar mass and radius. We identify a group of eight planets (including
WASP-19 b, HAT-P-7 b, and WASP-12 b) for which current density uncertainties
are as much as 4x smaller than the potential shift due to tides, implying a

different positions within the parent galaxy. We analysed the main groups of
elements, namely light- (Na), alpha- (O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), iron-peak (Sc, V, Fe,
Ni, Cu) and s-process elements (Zr, Ba, La). The metallicity distribution of
the sample displays a main peak around [Fe/H] ~ -1 dex and a weak metal-poor
tail. However, the three fields display [Fe/H] distributions different with
each other, in particular a difference of 0.2 dex is found between the mean
metallicities of the two most internal fields.The fraction of metal-poor stars
increases significantly (from ~1 to ~20%) from the innermost fields to the most
external one, likely reflecting an age gradient in the SMC. Also, we found a
hint of possible chemically/kinematic distinct substructures. The SMC stars
have abundance ratios clearly distinct with respect to the Milky Way stars, in
particular for the elements produced by massive stars (like Na, $\alpha$ and
most iron-peak elements) that have abundance ratios systematically lower than
those measured in our Galaxy. This points out that the massive stars
contributed less to the chemical enrichment of the SMC with respect to the
Milky Way, according to the low star formation rate expected for this galaxy.
Finally, we identified small systematic differences in the abundances of some
elements (Na, Ti, V and Zr) in the two innermost fields, suggesting that the
chemical enrichment history in the SMC has been not uniform.

precise inference of their mass based on asteroseismic constraints. However,
there are cases where such age estimates can be highly precise yet very
inaccurate. An example is giants that have undergone mass loss or mass transfer
events that have significantly altered their mass. In this context, stars with
""apparent"" ages significantly higher than the age of the Universe are
candidates as stripped stars, or stars that have lost more mass than expected,
most likely via interaction with a companion star, or because of the poorly
understood mass-loss mechanism along the red-giant branch. In this work we
identify examples of such objects among red giants observed by
$\textit{Kepler}$, both at low ([Fe/H] $ \lesssim -0.5$) and solar metallicity.
By modelling their structure and pulsation spectra, we find a consistent
picture confirming that these are indeed low-mass objects consisting of a He
core of $\approx 0.5 \, M_\odot$ and an envelope of $\approx 0.1 - 0.2 \,
M_\odot$. Moreover, we find that these stars are characterised by a rather
extreme coupling ($q \gtrsim 0.4$) between the pressure-mode and gravity-mode
cavities, i.e. much higher than the typical value for red clump stars,
providing thus a direct seismic signature of their peculiar structure. The
complex pulsation spectra of these objects, if observed with sufficient
frequency resolution, hold detailed information about the structural properties
of likely products of mass stripping, hence can potentially shed light on their
formation mechanism. On the other hand, our tests highlight the difficulties
associated with measuring reliably the large frequency separation, especially
in shorter datasets, with impact on the reliability of the inferred masses and
ages of low-mass Red Clump stars with e.g. K2 or TESS data.

coefficients that do not depend on the order of the variables. In many cases,
there is a natural asymmetry between extreme observations that can not be
captured by such coefficients. An example for such asymmetry are large
discharges at an upstream and a downstream stations on a river network: an
extreme discharge at the upstream station will directly influence the discharge
at the downstream station, but not vice versa. Simple measures for asymmetric
dependence in extreme events have not yet been investigated. We propose the
asymmetric tail Kendall's $\tau$ as a measure for extremal dependence that is
sensitive to asymmetric behaviour in the largest observations. It essentially
computes the classical Kendall's $\tau$ but conditioned on the extreme
observations of one of the two variables. We show theoretical properties of
this new coefficient and derive a formula to compute it for existing copula

simulation experiments. We apply our methodology to a case study on river

asymmetric extremal dependence in hydrology. Our results show that there is
important structural information in the asymmetry that would have been missed

reconstruct solutions with small scatters of multiple images in both source

results by a factor of 5-10. An outstanding case is the MACS J0416.1-2403 mass
reconstruction, which is based on the largest high-quality SL dataset where all
236 multiple images/knots have spectroscopic redshifts. Although our solution
is smooth on a large scale, it reveals group/galaxy-scale peaks where the
substructures are required by the data. We find that in general, these mass
peaks are in excellent spatial agreement with the member galaxies, although
${\tt MARS}$ never uses the galaxy distributions as priors. Our study
corroborates the flexibility and accuracy of the ${\tt MARS}$ algorithm and
demonstrates that ${\tt MARS}$ is a powerful tool in the JWST era, when $2-3$

they are inserted after vertical integration, as if the system is actually
two-dimensional. Since turbulence breaks mirror symmetry, it is more physically
correct to insert a turbulence model at the three-dimensional level, and impose
mirror symmetry only on average. Thus, some viscous terms are usually missing.
We revisit the vertical integration procedure, restricting to the regime of a
Newtonian, non-self-gravitating disk. We obtain six evolution equations with
only horizontal dependence, which determine the local vertical position and
velocity of the disk surface, in addition to the usual fluid variables. This
""2.5-dimensional"" formulation opens the door to efficiently study vertical
oscillations of thin disks in dynamical settings, and to improve the treatment
of unresolved turbulence. As a demonstration, by including viscous stress at
the three-dimensional level, we recover missing viscous terms which involve the
vertical variables. We also propose a resummation of the vertically integrated
gravitational force, which has a strikingly similar form to a gravitational
softening model advocated for in protoplanetary disk studies.

the nature of hidden sector particles, with particular emphasis on the
so-called X17 particle, has been approved at Jefferson Lab. The search for
these particles is motivated by new hidden sector models introduced to account
for a variety of experimental and observational puzzles: excess in $e^+e^-$
pairs observed in multiple nuclear transitions, the 4.2$\sigma$ disagreement
between experiments and the standard model prediction for the muon anomalous
magnetic moment, and the small-scale structure puzzle in cosmological
simulations. The aforementioned X17 particle has been hypothesized to account
for the excess in $e^+e^-$ pairs observed from the $^8$Be M1, $^4$He M0, and,
most recently, $^{12}$C E1 nuclear transitions to their ground states observed
by the ATOMKI group. This experiment will use a high resolution electromagnetic
calorimeter to search for or set new limits on the production rate of the X17
and other hidden sector particles in the $3 - 60$ MeV mass range via their
$e^+e^-$ decay (or $\gamma\gamma$ decay with limited tracking). In these
models, the $1 - 100$ MeV mass range is particularly well-motivated and the
lower part of this range still remains unexplored. Our proposed direct
detection experiment will use a magnetic-spectrometer-free setup (the PRad
apparatus) to detect all three final state particles in the visible decay of a
hidden sector particle for an effective control of the background and will
cover the proposed mass range in a single setting. The use of the
well-demonstrated PRad setup allows for an essentially ready-to-run and
uniquely cost-effective search for hidden sector particles in the $3 - 60$ MeV
mass range with a sensitivity of 8.9$\times$10$^{-8}$ - 5.8$\times$10$^{-9}$ to
$\epsilon^2$, the square of the kinetic mixing interaction constant between
hidden and visible sectors.

2019), we show that bursts which ignite in a helium layer underneath a
hydrogen-rich shell naturally give rise to such pauses, as long as enough
energy is produced to eject the outer layers of the envelope by super-Eddington
winds. The length of the pause is determined by the extent of the convection
generated after ignition, while the rate of change of luminosity following the
pause is set by the hydrogen gradient left behind by convection. Using the MESA
stellar evolution code, we simulate the accumulation, nuclear burning and
convective mixing prior to and throughout the ignition of the burst, followed
by the hydrodynamic wind. We show that the results are sensitive to the
treatment of convection adopted within the code. In particular, the efficiency
of mixing at the H/He interface plays a key role in determining the shape of
the lightcurve. The data from SAX J1808.4-3658 favors strong mixing scenarios.
Multidimensional simulations will be needed to properly model the interaction
between convection and nuclear burning during these bursts, which will then
enable a new way to use X-ray burst lightcurves to study neutron star surfaces.

of emission lines from molecules previously identified in infrared spectra of
classical T Tauri disks: H2O, OH, H2, HCN, C2H2, and CO2. The detection of
organic molecules demonstrates that they are back after disappearing during the
large outburst. Spectral lines from water and OH are for the first time
de-blended and will provide a much improved characterization of their

emission bands from warm, sub-micron size amorphous silicate grains at 10 and
18 um. During the outburst, in 2008, crystalline forsterite grains were
annealed in the inner disk within 1 au, but their spectral signatures in the 10

via their 19.0, 20.0, and 23.5 um emission, whose strength implies that the

  Learning for Automatic Scoring in Science Education","10 page + 1 figure",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Developing models to automatically score students' written responses to
science problems is critical for science education. However, collecting and
labeling sufficient student responses for training models is time and
cost-consuming. Recent studies suggest that pre-trained language models can be
adapted to downstream tasks without fine-tuning with prompts. However, no
research has employed such a prompt approach in science education. As student
responses are presented with natural language, aligning the scoring procedure
as the next sentence prediction task using prompts can skip the costly
fine-tuning stage. In this study, we developed a zero-shot approach to
automatically score student responses via Matching Exemplars as Next Sentence
Prediction (MeNSP). This approach employs no training samples. We first apply
MeNSP in scoring three assessment tasks of scientific argumentation and found
machine-human scoring agreements, Cohen's Kappa ranges from 0.30 to 0.57, and
F1 score ranges from 0.54 to 0.81. To improve the performance, we extend our
research to the few-shots setting, either randomly selecting labeled student
responses or manually constructing responses to fine-tune the models. We find
that one task's performance is improved with more samples, Cohen's Kappa from
0.30 to 0.38, and F1 score from 0.54 to 0.59; for the two others, scoring
performance is not improved. We also find that randomly selected few-shots
perform better than the human expert-crafted approach. This study suggests that
MeNSP can yield referable automatic scoring for student responses while
significantly reducing the cost of model training. This method can benefit
low-stakes classroom assessment practices in science education. Future research
should further explore the applicability of the MeNSP in different types of
assessment tasks in science education and improve the model performance.

events in our solar system. The prediction and understanding of CMEs is of
particular importance due to the impact that they can have on Earth-based
satellite systems, and in extreme cases, ground-based electronics. CMEs often
occur when long-lived magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) anchored to the solar surface
destabilize and erupt away from the Sun. One potential cause for these
eruptions is an ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instability such as the kink or
torus instability. Previous experiments on the Magnetic Reconnection eXperiment
(MRX) revealed a class of MFRs that were torus-unstable but kink-stable, which
failed to erupt. These ""failed-tori"" went through a process similar to Taylor
relaxation where the toroidal current was redistributed before the eruption
ultimately failed. We have investigated this behavior through additional
diagnostics that measure the current distribution at the foot points and the
energy distribution before and after an event. These measurements indicate that
ideal MHD effects are sufficient to explain the energy distribution changes
during failed torus events. This excludes Taylor relaxation as a possible
mechanism of current redistribution during an event. A new model that only
requires non-ideal effects in a thin layer above the electrodes is presented to
explain the observed phenomena. This work broadens our understanding of the
stability of MFRs and the mechanism behind the failed torus through the
improved prediction of the torus instability and through new diagnostics to
measure the energy inventory and current profile at the foot points.

endocytosis, the cell surface wraps around the nanoparticle to effectively eat
it. Prior focus has been on how nanoparticle size and shape impacts
endocytosis. However, inspired by the noted presence of extracellular vimentin
affecting viral and bacteria uptake, as well as the structure of coronaviruses,
we construct a computational model in which both the cell-like construct and
the virus-like construct contain filamentous protein structures protruding from
their surfaces. We then study the impact of these additional degrees of freedom
on viral wrapping. We find that cells with an optimal density of filamentous
extracellular components (ECCs) are more likely to be infected as they uptake
the virus faster and use relatively less cell surface area per individual
virus. At the optimal density, the cell surface folds around the virus, and
folds are faster and more efficient at wrapping the virus than crumple-like
wrapping. We also find that cell surface bending rigidity helps generate folds,
as bending rigidity enhances force transmission across the surface. However,
changing other mechanical parameters, such as the stretching stiffness of
filamentous ECCs or virus spikes, can drive crumple-like formation of the cell
surface. We conclude with the implications of our study on the evolutionary
pressures of virus-like particles, with a particular focus on the cellular
microenvironment that may include filamentous ECCs.

present Semi-Autonomous MCAS (SA-MCAS), a new MCAS that both meets the intended
goals of MCAS and avoids the failure cases that plagued the original MCAS

asynchronous sensing, unlock a new realm of high-speed and high dynamic range
applications. However, researchers often either revert to a framed
representation of event data for applications, or build bespoke applications
for a particular camera's event data type. To usher in the next era of video
systems, accommodate new event camera designs, and explore the benefits to
asynchronous video in classical applications, we argue that there is a need for
an asynchronous, source-agnostic video representation. In this paper, we
introduce a novel, asynchronous intensity representation for both framed and
non-framed data sources. We show that our representation can increase intensity
precision and greatly reduce the number of samples per pixel compared to
grid-based representations. With framed sources, we demonstrate that by
permitting a small amount of loss through the temporal averaging of similar
pixel values, we can reduce our representational sample rate by more than half,
while incurring a drop in VMAF quality score of only 4.5. We also demonstrate
lower latency than the state-of-the-art method for fusing and transcoding
framed and event camera data to an intensity representation, while maintaining
$2000\times$ the temporal resolution. We argue that our method provides the
computational efficiency and temporal granularity necessary to build real-time
intensity-based applications for event cameras.

to identify candidate joins, ntLink utilizes minimizer-based mappings to infer
how input sequences should be ordered and oriented into scaffolds. Recent
improvements to ntLink have added important features such as overlap detection,
gap-filling and in-code scaffolding iterations. Here, we present three basic
protocols demonstrating how to use each of these new features to yield highly
contiguous genome assemblies, while still maintaining ntLink's proven
computational efficiency. Further, as we illustrate in the alternate protocols,
the lightweight minimizer-based mappings that enable ntLink scaffolding can
also be utilized for other downstream applications, such as misassembly

data restrictions, with applications to neoadjuvant clinical trials,

  In the first project, we propose a method under the principal stratification
framework to identify and estimate the average treatment effects on a binary
outcome, conditional on the counterfactual status of a post-treatment
intermediate response. Under mild assumptions, the treatment effect of interest
can be identified. We extend the approach to address censored outcome data. The
proposed method is applied to a neoadjuvant clinical trial and its performance
is evaluated via simulation studies.
  In the second project, we propose a tree-based model averaging approach to
improve the estimation accuracy of conditional average treatment effects at a
target site by leveraging models derived from other potentially heterogeneous
sites, without them sharing subject-level data. The performance of this
approach is demonstrated by a study of the causal effects of oxygen therapy on
hospital survival rates and backed up by comprehensive simulations.
  In the third project, we propose a robust individualized decision learning
framework with sensitive variables to improve the worst-case outcomes of
individuals caused by sensitive variables that are unavailable at the time of
decision. Unlike most existing work that uses mean-optimal objectives, we
propose a robust learning framework by finding a newly defined quantile- or
infimum-optimal decision rule. From a causal perspective, we also generalize
the classic notion of (average) fairness to conditional fairness for individual
subjects. The reliable performance of the proposed method is demonstrated
through synthetic experiments and three real-data applications.

management problem that is essential for self-organizing and autonomous 6G
networks. Our aim is to accurately predict the future positions of mobile users
in wireless networks using QRC. To do so, we use a real-world time series
dataset to model mobile users' trajectories. The QRC approach has two
components: reservoir computing (RC) and quantum computing (QC). In RC, the
training is more computational-efficient than the training of simple recurrent
neural networks (RNN) since, in RC, only the weights of the output layer are
trainable. The internal part of RC is what is called the reservoir. For the RC
to perform well, the weights of the reservoir should be chosen carefully to
create highly complex and nonlinear dynamics. The QC is used to create such
dynamical reservoir that maps the input time series into higher dimensional
computational space composed of dynamical states. After obtaining the
high-dimensional dynamical states, a simple linear regression is performed to
train the output weights and thus the prediction of the mobile users'
trajectories can be performed efficiently. In this paper, we apply a QRC
approach based on the Hamiltonian time evolution of a quantum system. We
simulate the time evolution using IBM gate-based quantum computers and we show
in the experimental results that the use of QRC to predict the mobile users'
trajectories with only a few qubits is efficient and is able to outperform the
classical approaches such as the long short-term memory (LSTM) approach and the
echo-state networks (ESN) approach.

essential task. As oil and gas operators work to reduce the consumption of
freshwater, it is increasingly important to actively manage fresh and non-fresh

at many sites has become too time-consuming and unsustainable, given the sheer
number of dispersed ponds, small lakes, playas, and wetlands over a large area.
Therefore, satellite-based environmental monitoring presents great potential.
Many existing satellite-based monitoring studies utilize index-based methods to
monitor large water bodies such as rivers and oceans. However, these existing
methods fail when monitoring small ponds-the reflectance signal received from
small water bodies is too weak to detect. To address this challenge, we propose
a new Water Quality Enhanced Index (WQEI) Model, which is designed to enable

can achieve high accuracy water quality monitoring efficiently in large

it also introduces security vulnerabilities, i.e., the exploitable
discrepancies between expected and actual behaviors of the contract code. To
address these discrepancies and increase the vulnerability coverage, we propose
a new smart contract security testing approach called transaction
encapsulation. The core idea lies in the local execution of transactions on a
fully-synchronized yet isolated Ethereum node, which creates a preview of
outcomes of transaction sequences on the current state of blockchain. This
approach poses a critical technical challenge -- the well-known
time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) problem, i.e., the assurance that the final
transactions will exhibit the same execution paths as the encapsulated test
transactions. In this work, we determine the exact conditions for guaranteed
execution path replicability of the tested transactions, and implement a
transaction testing tool, TxT, which reveals the actual outcomes of Ethereum
transactions. To ensure the correctness of testing, TxT deterministically
verifies whether a given sequence of transactions ensues an identical execution
path on the current state of blockchain. We analyze over 1.3 billion Ethereum
transactions and determine that 96.5% of them can be verified by TxT. We
further show that TxT successfully reveals the suspicious behaviors associated

combinatorial optimization problems. Current quantum annealing hardware is
relatively sparse and therefore requires graph minor embedding in order to map
an arbitrarily structured problem onto the sparse, and relatively small,
quantum annealing processor. This paper proposes a new minor embedding method
called 4-clique minor embedding. This is in contrast to the standard minor
embedding technique of using a path of linearly connected qubits in order to
represent a logical variable state. The 4-clique minor embedding is possible
because of Pegasus graph connectivity, which is the native hardware graph for
some of the current D-Wave quantum annealers. The Pegasus hardware graph has
many 4-cliques, and it is possible to form a graph composed entirely of paths
of connected 4-cliques, on which a problem can be minor embedded. The 4-clique
chains come at the cost of additional qubit usage on the hardware graph, but
they allow for stronger coupling within each chain thereby increasing chain
integrity and reducing chain breaks. This 4-clique minor embedding technique is
described in detail, and is compared against the standard linear path minor
embedding with some experiments on two D-Wave quantum annealing processors with
Pegasus hardware graphs. 4-clique minor embeddings can use weak chain strengths
while successfully carrying out the computation of minimizing random all-to-all
spin glass problem instances, in contrast to the linear path minor embeddings
which have high chain break frequencies for weak chain strengths. This work
shows that non standard minor embedding methods could be useful. For future
quantum annealing architectures, distributing minor embeddings over more
densely connected regions of hardware instead of linear paths may provide more
robust computations for minor embedding problems.

However, CT images obtained from various scanners with customized acquisition
protocols may introduce considerable variations in texture features, even for

that require consistent and reliable feature analysis. Existing CT image
harmonization models rely on GAN-based supervised or semi-supervised learning,
with limited performance. This work addresses the issue of CT image
harmonization using a new diffusion-based model, named DiffusionCT, to
standardize CT images acquired from different vendors and protocols.
DiffusionCT operates in the latent space by mapping a latent non-standard
distribution into a standard one. DiffusionCT incorporates an Unet-based
encoder-decoder, augmented by a diffusion model integrated into the bottleneck
part. The model is designed in two training phases. The encoder-decoder is
first trained, without embedding the diffusion model, to learn the latent
representation of the input data. The latent diffusion model is then trained in
the next training phase while fixing the encoder-decoder. Finally, the decoder
synthesizes a standardized image with the transformed latent representation.
The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in the
performance of the standardization task using DiffusionCT.

detected in more than a dozen binary systems. However, only two of these were
g-mode pulsators. Aims. We aim to detect tidally perturbed g modes in
additional binary systems and characterise them observationally. Methods. We
perform a custom data reduction of the available Kepler and TESS photometry of
a well-studied sample of 35 binary systems with gamma Doradus pulsators. For
each target, we model the binary signal using a sum of 100 sine waves, with
frequencies at orbital harmonics, and measure significant pulsation frequencies
by iteratively prewhitening the residual light curve. Pulsations are labelled
as tidally perturbed g modes if they are part of both period-spacing patterns
and orbital-frequency-spaced multiplets. After visual inspection and
confirmation, the properties of these targets and g modes are characterised.
Results. We detect tidally perturbed g-mode pulsations for five short-period
binaries that are circularised and (almost) synchronously rotating: KIC3228863,
KIC3341457, KIC4947528, KIC9108579, and KIC12785282. Tidally perturbed g modes
that occur within the same star and have the same mode identification (k,m),
are found to have near-identical relative amplitude and phase modulations,
which are within their respective 1-sigma uncertainties also identical for the
Kepler and TESS photometric passbands. By contrast, pulsations with different
mode identification (k,m) are found to exhibit different modulations. Moreover,
the observed amplitude and phase modulations are correlated, indicating that
the binary tides primarily distort g-mode amplitudes on the stellar surface.
The phase modulations are then primarily a geometric effect of the integration
of the stellar flux over the visible stellar surface. (abbreviated)

Saint-Venant equations with bottom friction terms leads to its decomposition
into a first order hyperbolic subsystem containing the nonlinear convective
term and a second order wave equation for the pressure. For the spatial
discretization of the free surface elevation an unstructured mesh of triangular
simplex elements is considered, whereas a dual grid of the edge-type is
employed for the computation of the depth-averaged momentum vector. The first
stage of the proposed algorithm consists in the solution of the nonlinear
convective subsystem using an explicit Godunov-type FV method on the staggered
grid. Next, a classical continuous FE scheme provides the free surface
elevation at the vertex of the primal mesh. The semi-implicit strategy followed
circumvents the contribution of the surface wave celerity to the CFL-type time
step restriction making the proposed algorithm well-suited for low Froude
number flows. The conservative formulation of the governing equations also
allows the discretization of high Froude number flows with shock waves. As
such, the new hybrid FV/FE scheme is able to deal simultaneously with both,
subcritical as well as supercritical flows. Besides, the algorithm is well
balanced by construction. The accuracy of the overall methodology is studied
numerically and the C-property is proven theoretically and validated via
numerical experiments. The solution of several Riemann problems attests the
robustness of the new method to deal also with flows containing bores and
discontinuities. Finally, a 3D dam break problem over a dry bottom is studied
and our numerical results are successfully compared with numerical reference
solutions and experimental data.

decentralized solutions to various problems, smart contracts have become more
popular to the point that billions of US Dollars are currently exchanged every

contracts have been exploited by attackers to steal cryptocurrencies worth

therefore is an essential research problem. Existing solutions to this problem
particularly rely on human experts to define features or different rules to
detect vulnerabilities. However, this often causes many vulnerabilities to be
ignored, and they are inefficient in detecting new vulnerabilities. In this
study, to overcome such challenges, we propose a framework to automatically
detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts on the blockchain. More specifically,
first, we utilize novel feature vector generation techniques from bytecode of
smart contract since the source code of smart contracts are rarely available in

Euler invariant, a familiar invariant in both differential topology

existence has not been explored in condensed matter systems. Specifically, we
firstly define two specific novel models in four dimensions that support a
non-zero second Euler number in the bulk together with peculiar gapless
boundary states. Secondly, we discuss its robustness in general
spacetime-inversion invariant phases and its role in the classification of
topological degenerate real bands through real Grassmannians. In particular, we
derive from homotopy arguments the minimal Bloch Hamiltonian form from which
the tight-binding models of any second Euler phase can be generated.
Considering more concretely the gapped Euler phase associated with the tangent
bundle of the four-sphere, we show that the bulk band structure of the
nontrivial 4D Euler phase necessarily exhibits triplets of linked nodal
surfaces (where the three types of nodal surfaces are formed by the crossing of
the three successive pairs of bands within one four-band subspace). Finally, we
show how to engineer these new topological phases in a four-dimensional

partisan segregation across news audiences cannot be fully explained by online

salient in polarizing public discourse around current events. In this work, we
expand the scope of analysis to include both online and more traditional media
by investigating the relationship between broadcast news media language and
social media discourse. By analyzing a decade's worth of closed captions (2
million speaker turns) from CNN and Fox News along with topically corresponding
discourse from Twitter, we provide a novel framework for measuring semantic
polarization between America's two major broadcast networks to demonstrate how
semantic polarization between these outlets has evolved (Study 1), peaked
(Study 2) and influenced partisan discussions on Twitter (Study 3) across the
last decade. Our results demonstrate a sharp increase in polarization in how
topically important keywords are discussed between the two channels, especially
after 2016, with overall highest peaks occurring in 2020. The two stations
discuss identical topics in drastically distinct contexts in 2020, to the
extent that there is barely any linguistic overlap in how identical keywords
are contextually discussed. Further, we demonstrate at scale, how such partisan
division in broadcast media language significantly shapes semantic polarity
trends on Twitter (and vice-versa), empirically linking for the first time, how

The recently described implicit-PDF (IPDF) is a simple, elegant, and effective
approach for learning arbitrary distributions on SO(3) up to a given precision.
However, inference with IPDF requires $N$ forward passes through the network's
final multilayer perceptron (where $N$ places an upper bound on the likelihood
that can be calculated by the model), which is prohibitively slow for those
without the computational resources necessary to parallelize the queries. In
this paper, I introduce AQuaMaM, a neural network capable of both learning
complex distributions on the rotation manifold and calculating exact
likelihoods for query rotations in a single forward pass. Specifically, AQuaMaM
autoregressively models the projected components of unit quaternions as
mixtures of uniform distributions that partition their geometrically-restricted
domain of values. When trained on an ""infinite"" toy dataset with ambiguous
viewpoints, AQuaMaM rapidly converges to a sampling distribution closely
matching the true data distribution. In contrast, the sampling distribution for
IPDF dramatically diverges from the true data distribution, despite IPDF
approaching its theoretical minimum evaluation loss during training. When
trained on a constructed dataset of 500,000 renders of a die in different
rotations, AQuaMaM reaches a test log-likelihood 14% higher than IPDF. Further,
compared to IPDF, AQuaMaM uses 24% fewer parameters, has a prediction

are trustworthy or suspicious. With the absence of a human monitor, the basic
approach is to use the model's output confidence score to assess if predictions
are trustworthy or suspicious. However, the model's confidence score is a
result of computations coming from a black box, therefore lacks transparency
and makes it challenging to automatedly credit trustworthiness to predictions.
We introduce the trustworthiness score (TS), a simple metric that provides a
more transparent and effective way of providing confidence in CNNs predictions
compared to model's confidence score. The metric quantifies the trustworthiness
in a prediction by checking for the existence of certain features in the
predictions made by the CNN. We also use the underlying idea of the TS metric,
to provide a suspiciousness score (SS) in the overall input frame to help in
the detection of suspicious frames where false negatives exist. We conduct a
case study using YOLOv5 on persons detection to demonstrate our method and
usage of TS and SS. The case study shows that using our method consistently
improves the precision of predictions compared to relying on model confidence
score alone, for both 1) approving of trustworthy predictions (~20%

  Certification",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Certified defenses against small-norm adversarial examples have received
growing attention in recent years; though certified accuracies of
state-of-the-art methods remain far below their non-robust counterparts,
despite the fact that benchmark datasets have been shown to be well-separated
at far larger radii than the literature generally attempts to certify. In this
work, we offer insights that identify potential factors in this performance
gap. Specifically, our analysis reveals that piecewise linearity imposes
fundamental limitations on the tightness of leading certification techniques.
These limitations are felt in practical terms as a greater need for capacity in
models hoped to be certified efficiently. Moreover, this is in addition to the
capacity necessary to learn a robust boundary, studied in prior work. However,
we argue that addressing the limitations of piecewise linearity through scaling
up model capacity may give rise to potential difficulties -- particularly
regarding robust generalization -- therefore, we conclude by suggesting that
developing smooth activation functions may be the way forward for advancing the
performance of certified neural networks.

  Model","preprint",,,,"cs.LG eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Gaussian process state-space model (GPSSM) has garnered considerable
attention over the past decade. However, the standard GP with a preliminary
kernel, such as the squared exponential kernel or Mat\'{e}rn kernel, that is
commonly used in GPSSM studies, limits the model's representation power and
substantially restricts its applicability to complex scenarios. To address this
issue, we propose a new class of probabilistic state-space models called
TGPSSMs, which leverage a parametric normalizing flow to enrich the GP priors
in the standard GPSSM, enabling greater flexibility and expressivity.
Additionally, we present a scalable variational inference algorithm that offers
a flexible and optimal structure for the variational distribution of latent
states. The proposed algorithm is interpretable and computationally efficient
due to the sparse GP representation and the bijective nature of normalizing
flow. Moreover, we incorporate a constrained optimization framework into the
algorithm to enhance the state-space representation capabilities and optimize
the hyperparameters, leading to superior learning and inference performance.
Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets corroborate that the
proposed TGPSSM outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. The accompanying

However, most of them have been found through the overdensity of star-forming

report the discovery of an overdense structure of massive quiescent galaxies
with the spectroscopic redshift $z=2.77$ in the COSMOS field, QO-1000. We first
photometrically identify this structure as a $4.2\sigma$ overdensity with 14
quiescent galaxies in $7\times4\ {\rm pMpc^2}$ from the COSMOS2020 catalog. We
then securely confirm the spectroscopic redshifts of 4 quiescent galaxies by
detecting multiple Balmer absorption lines with Keck/MOSFIRE. All the
spectroscopically confirmed members are massive
($\log{(M_\star/M_\odot)}>11.0$) and located in a narrow redshift range
($2.76<z<2.79$). Moreover, three of them are in the $1\times1\ {\rm pMpc^2}$ in
the transverse direction at the same redshift ($z=2.760-2.763$). Such a
concentration of four spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies implies
that QO-1000 is $>68$ times denser than in the general field. In addition, we
confirm that they form a red sequence in the $J-K_s$ color. This structure's
halo mass is estimated as $\log{(M_{\rm halo}/M_\odot)}>13.2$ from their
stellar mass. Similar structures found in the IllustrisTNG simulation are
expected to evolve into massive galaxy clusters with $\log{(M_{\rm
halo}/M_\odot)}\geq14.8$ at $z=0$. These results suggest that QO-1000 is a more
mature protocluster than the other known protoclusters. It is likely in a
transition phase between the star-forming protoclusters and the quenched galaxy
clusters.

mapping from source conditional data X to target data Y. The target Y (e.g.,
text, speech, music, image, video) is usually high-dimensional and complex, and
contains information that does not exist in source data, which hinders
effective and efficient learning on the source-target mapping. In this paper,
we present a learning paradigm called regeneration learning for data
generation, which first generates Y' (an abstraction/representation of Y) from
X and then generates Y from Y'. During training, Y' is obtained from Y through
either handcrafted rules or self-supervised learning and is used to learn
X-->Y' and Y'-->Y. Regeneration learning extends the concept of representation
learning to data generation tasks, and can be regarded as a counterpart of
traditional representation learning, since 1) regeneration learning handles the
abstraction (Y') of the target data Y for data generation while traditional
representation learning handles the abstraction (X') of source data X for data
understanding; 2) both the processes of Y'-->Y in regeneration learning and
X-->X' in representation learning can be learned in a self-supervised way
(e.g., pre-training); 3) both the mappings from X to Y' in regeneration
learning and from X' to Y in representation learning are simpler than the
direct mapping from X to Y. We show that regeneration learning can be a
widely-used paradigm for data generation (e.g., text generation, speech
recognition, speech synthesis, music composition, image generation, and video
generation) and can provide valuable insights into developing data generation

knowledge distillation methods to transfer language-independent knowledge from
the rich-resource source languages to zero-resource languages is an effective
means. Typically, these approaches adopt a teacher-student architecture, where
the teacher network is trained in the source language, and the student network
seeks to learn knowledge from the teacher network and is expected to perform
well in the target language. Despite the impressive performance achieved by
these methods, we argue that they have two limitations. Firstly, the teacher
network fails to effectively learn language-independent knowledge shared across
languages due to the differences in the feature distribution between the source
and target languages. Secondly, the student network acquires all of its
knowledge from the teacher network and ignores the learning of target
language-specific knowledge. Undesirably, these limitations would hinder the
model's performance in the target language. This paper proposes an unsupervised
prototype knowledge distillation network (ProKD) to address these issues.
Specifically, ProKD presents a contrastive learning-based prototype alignment
method to achieve class feature alignment by adjusting the distance among
prototypes in the source and target languages, boosting the teacher network's
capacity to acquire language-independent knowledge. In addition, ProKD
introduces a prototypical self-training method to learn the intrinsic structure
of the language by retraining the student network on the target data using
samples' distance information from prototypes, thereby enhancing the student
network's ability to acquire language-specific knowledge. Extensive experiments
on three benchmark cross-lingual NER datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach.

parameterizing set operators with complex neural networks. However, such
methods usually train neural set operators with a large number of entity and

paper, we propose a simple framework for complex query answering that
decomposes the KG embeddings from neural set operators. We propose to represent
the complex queries into the query graph. On top of the query graph, we propose
the Logical Message Passing Neural Network (LMPNN) that connects the local
one-hop inferences on atomic formulas to the global logical reasoning for
complex query answering. We leverage existing effective KG embeddings to
conduct one-hop inferences on atomic formulas, the results of which are
regarded as the messages passed in LMPNN. The reasoning process over the
overall logical formulas is turned into the forward pass of LMPNN that
incrementally aggregates local information to finally predict the answers'
embeddings. The complex logical inference across different types of queries
will then be learned from training examples based on the LMPNN architecture.
Theoretically, our query-graph represenation is more general than the
prevailing operator-tree formulation, so our approach applies to a broader
range of complex KG queries. Empirically, our approach yields the new

an integrated demand response mechanism is developed that effectively promotes
the consumption of renewable energy. The proposed method is simulated in an
actual CIES in North China. In comparison with traditional stochastic
programming and robust optimization, it is verified that the proposed DRO model
properly balances the relationship between economical operation and robustness
while exhibiting stronger adaptability. Furthermore, our approach outperforms
other commonly used DRO methods with better operational economy, lower
renewable power curtailment rate, and higher computational efficiency.

pressures, and magnetic fields that are unattainable on Earth. To better
understand how these three physical parameters interact with each other and
with other stellar features, we determined the magnetic field strength for a
total of 804 hydrogen-rich white dwarfs of which 287 are not in the literature.
We fitted the spectra observed with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey using
atmospheric models that consider the Zeeman effect due to the magnetic field at
each point in the stellar disk. Comparing magnetic and non-magnetic WDs, the
literature already shows that the magnetic ones have on average higher mass
than the non-magnetic. In addition to that, magnetic fields are more common in
cooler WDs than in hotter WDs. In consonance, we found that those with higher
magnetic field strengths tend to have higher masses, and lower temperatures,
for which models indicate the crystallization process has already started. This
reinforces the hypothesis that the field is being generated and/or amplified in
the cooling process of the white dwarf. Our sample constitutes the largest
number of white dwarfs with determined magnetic fields to date.

radio signal classification tasks. In FL, model parameters are periodically
communicated from participating devices, training on their own local datasets,

privacy/security advantages due to raw data not leaving the devices, it is
still susceptible to several adversarial attacks. In this work, we reveal the
susceptibility of FL-based signal classifiers to model poisoning attacks, which
compromise the training process despite not observing data transmissions. In
this capacity, we develop an attack framework in which compromised FL devices
perturb their local datasets using adversarial evasion attacks. As a result,
the training process of the global model significantly degrades on
in-distribution signals (i.e., signals received over channels with identical
distributions at each edge device). We compare our work to previously proposed
FL attacks and reveal that as few as one adversarial device operating with a
low-powered perturbation under our attack framework can induce the potent model
poisoning attack to the global classifier. Moreover, we find that more devices
partaking in adversarial poisoning will proportionally degrade the

and signal-to-noise ratio. However, it is more challenging to reconstruct 3D
MRI images. Current methods are mainly based on convolutional neural networks
(CNN) with small kernels, which are difficult to scale up to have sufficient
fitting power for 3D MRI reconstruction due to the large image size and GPU
memory constraint. Furthermore, MRI reconstruction is a deconvolution problem,
which demands long-distance information that is difficult to capture by CNNs
with small convolution kernels. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) can model such
long-distance information, but it requires a fixed input size. In this paper,
we proposed Recon3DMLP, a hybrid of CNN modules with small kernels for
low-frequency reconstruction and adaptive MLP (dMLP) modules with large kernels
to boost the high-frequency reconstruction, for 3D MRI reconstruction. We
further utilized the circular shift operation based on MRI physics such that
dMLP accepts arbitrary image size and can extract global information from the
entire FOV. We also propose a GPU memory efficient data fidelity module that
can reduce $>$50$\%$ memory. We compared Recon3DMLP with other CNN-based models
on a high-resolution (HR) 3D MRI dataset. Recon3DMLP improves HR 3D
reconstruction and outperforms several existing CNN-based models under similar

in various applications and scenarios. Recently, contrastive learning and
Transformer-based models have achieved good performance in many long-term

methods. First, the training paradigm of contrastive learning and downstream
prediction tasks are inconsistent, leading to inaccurate prediction results.
Second, existing Transformer-based models which resort to similar patterns in
historical time series data for predicting future values generally induce
severe distribution shift problems, and do not fully leverage the sequence
information compared to self-supervised methods. To address these issues, we
propose a novel framework named Ti-MAE, in which the input time series are
assumed to follow an integrate distribution. In detail, Ti-MAE randomly masks
out embedded time series data and learns an autoencoder to reconstruct them at
the point-level. Ti-MAE adopts mask modeling (rather than contrastive learning)
as the auxiliary task and bridges the connection between existing
representation learning and generative Transformer-based methods, reducing the
difference between upstream and downstream forecasting tasks while maintaining
the utilization of original time series data. Experiments on several public
real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework of masked autoencoding could
learn strong representations directly from the raw data, yielding better
performance in time series forecasting and classification tasks.

vibration about its mean path. Even for a hovering case, a flier experiences
such vibration due to the oscillatory nature of the aerodynamic forces. In this
paper we have studied the effect of such vibration on hovering. We used two
setups to measure thrust force generated by flapping robots. One involving
loadcell, which does not allow any kind of vibration. The other one involves a
pendulum which allows vibration at a particular direction. We used two
different flapping robots; one is a traditional flapping robot with two wings
and the other one is a four wings robot which exploits clap and peel mechanism
to generate thrust. We observed that the loadcell setup measures more thrust
for the two wings model than the pendulum setup. The opposite trend was
observed for the four wings model. We measured the vibration induced velocity
using motion capture system. We used well known aerodynamic models to observe
the effect of the vibration during the flapping cycle. To gain physical insight
into the vibration affected flow field, we used smoke flow visualization at
different instances during the flapping cycle. It revealed that the
perturbation ebbs a jet effect in case of the two wings which leads to its
adverse effect for thrust generation. On the contrary the perturbation enhances
the clapping effect for the four wings robot, resulting favorable for thrust
generation.

network (a.k.a. Implicit Neural Representations, INRs) has attracted increasing
attention in recent years. Neural Processes (NPs), which model the
distributions over functions conditioned on partial observations (context set),
provide a practical solution for fast inference of continuous functions.
However, existing NP architectures suffer from inferior modeling capability for
complex signals. In this paper, we propose an efficient NP framework dubbed
Versatile Neural Processes (VNP), which largely increases the capability of
approximating functions. Specifically, we introduce a bottleneck encoder that
produces fewer and informative context tokens, relieving the high computational
cost while providing high modeling capability. At the decoder side, we
hierarchically learn multiple global latent variables that jointly model the
global structure and the uncertainty of a function, enabling our model to
capture the distribution of complex signals. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed VNP on a variety of tasks involving 1D, 2D and 3D signals.
Particularly, our method shows promise in learning accurate INRs w.r.t. a 3D

expensive. Moreover, the available training samples for a given task are
generally scarce and imbalanced. These conditions are not conducive for
learning effective deep neural models. Hence, it is common to 'transfer' neural
networks trained on natural images to the medical image domain. However, this
paradigm lacks in performance due to the large domain gap between the natural
and medical image data. To address that, we propose a novel concept of Pre-text
Representation Transfer (PRT). In contrast to the conventional transfer
learning, which fine-tunes a source model after replacing its classification
layers, PRT retains the original classification layers and updates the
representation layers through an unsupervised pre-text task. The task is
performed with (original, not synthetic) medical images, without utilizing any
annotations. This enables representation transfer with a large amount of
training data. This high-fidelity representation transfer allows us to use the
resulting model as a more effective feature extractor. Moreover, we can also
subsequently perform the traditional transfer learning with this model. We
devise a collaborative representation based classification layer for the case
when we leverage the model as a feature extractor. We fuse the output of this
layer with the predictions of a model induced with the traditional transfer
learning performed over our pre-text transferred model. The utility of our
technique for limited and imbalanced data classification problem is
demonstrated with an extensive five-fold evaluation for three large-scale
models, tested for five different class-imbalance ratios for CT based COVID-19
detection. Our results show a consistent gain over the conventional transfer
learning with the proposed method.

antiphase. Except for the ferromagnetic phase and antiphase, the others should
be metastates, whose transitions are crossing over in nature. The results
clarify the controversial issues about the phases in the 1D ANNNI model and

applications, where the goal is to analyze and monitor the behaviour of a data
stream. In this paper, we study change detection in binary streams. To this
end, we use a likelihood ratio between two models as a measure for indicating
change. The first model is a single bernoulli variable while the second model
divides the stored data in two segments, and models each segment with its own
bernoulli variable. Finding the optimal split can be done in $O(n)$ time, where
$n$ is the number of entries since the last change point. This is too expensive
for large $n$. To combat this we propose an approximation scheme that yields
$(1 - \epsilon)$ approximation in $O(\epsilon^{-1} \log^2 n)$ time. The
speed-up consists of several steps: First we reduce the number of possible
candidates by adopting a known result from segmentation problems. We then show
that for fixed bernoulli parameters we can find the optimal change point in
logarithmic time. Finally, we show how to construct a candidate list of size
$O(\epsilon^{-1} \log n)$ for model parameters. We demonstrate empirically the
approximation quality and the running time of our algorithm, showing that we
can gain a significant speed-up with a minimal average loss in optimality.

pressure using high power density laser radiation, offer a potentially new
route to space exploration within and beyond the solar system, extending to

submicron thickness, posing substantial challenges for materials science and
engineering. We analyze the structural and photonic design of flexible
lightsails, developing a mesh-based multiphysics simulator based on linear
elastic theory, treating the lightsail as a flexible membrane rather than a
rigid body. We find that flexible lightsail membranes can be spin stabilized to
prevent shape collapse during acceleration, and that certain lightsail shapes
and designs offer beam-riding stability despite the deformations caused by
photon pressure and thermal expansion. Excitingly, nanophotonic lightsails
based on planar silicon nitride membranes patterned with suitably designed
optical metagratings exhibit both mechanically and dynamically stable
propulsion along the pump laser axis. These advances suggest that laser-driven
acceleration of membrane-like lightsails to the relativistic speeds needed to
access interstellar distances is conceptually feasible, and that fabrication of
such lightsails may be within the reach of modern microfabrication technology.

data-center environments that assumes homogeneous compute resources, high
network bandwidth, sufficient memory and storage, as well as independent and
identically distributed (IID) data across all nodes. However, these assumptions
don't necessarily apply on the edge, especially when training neural networks
on streaming data in an online manner. Computing on the edge suffers from both
systems and statistical heterogeneity. Systems heterogeneity is attributed to
differences in compute resources and bandwidth specific to each device, while
statistical heterogeneity comes from unbalanced and skewed data on the edge.
Different streaming-rates among devices can be another source of heterogeneity
when dealing with streaming data. If the streaming rate is lower than training
batch-size, device needs to wait until enough samples have streamed in before
performing a single iteration of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Thus,
low-volume streams act like stragglers slowing down devices with high-volume
streams in synchronous training. On the other hand, data can accumulate quickly
in the buffer if the streaming rate is too high and the devices can't train at
line-rate. In this paper, we introduce ScaDLES to efficiently train on
streaming data at the edge in an online fashion, while also addressing the
challenges of limited bandwidth and training with non-IID data. We empirically

PolySnake, for contour-based instance segmentation. Motivated by the classic
Snake algorithm, the proposed PolySnake achieves superior and robust
segmentation performance with an iterative and progressive contour refinement
strategy. Technically, PolySnake introduces a recurrent update operator to
estimate the object contour iteratively. It maintains a single estimate of the
contour that is progressively deformed toward the object boundary. At each
iteration, PolySnake builds a semantic-rich representation for the current
contour and feeds it to the recurrent operator for further contour adjustment.
Through the iterative refinements, the contour finally progressively converges
to a stable status that tightly encloses the object instance. Moreover, with a
compact design of the recurrent architecture, we ensure the running efficiency
under multiple iterations. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the
merits of our method, and the results demonstrate that the proposed PolySnake
outperforms the existing contour-based instance segmentation methods on several

  Euler-Maruyama scheme",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the approximation of the ergodic measure of the following stochastic
differential equation (SDE) on $\mathbb{R}^d$: \begin{eqnarray}\label{e:SDEE} d
X_t &=& (b_1(X_t)+b_2(X_t)) d t+\sigma(X_t) d W_t, \end{eqnarray} where $W_t$
is a $d$-dimensional standard Brownian motion, and $b_1: \mathbb{R}^d \mapsto
\mathbb{R}^d$, $b_2: \mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R}^d$ and $\sigma:
\mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ are the functions to be specified
in Assumption 2.1 below. In particular, $b_1$ satisfies $b_1\in
\mathbb{L}^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)\cap \mathbb{L}^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ or $b_1 \in
\mathcal{C}_b^{\alpha}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with $\alpha\in (0,1)$, which makes the
standard numerical schemes not work or fail to give a good convergence rate.
  In order to overcome these two difficulties, we first apply a Zvonkin's
transform to SDE and obtain a new SDE which has coefficients with nice
properties and admits a unique ergodic measure $\widehat \mu$, then discretize
the new equation by Euler-Maruyama scheme to approximate $\widehat \mu$, and
finally use the inverse Zvonkin's transform to get an approximation of the
ergodic measure of SDE, denoted by $\mu$. Our approximation method is inspired
by Xie and Zhang [22].
  The proof of our main result is based on the method of introducing a
stationary Markov chain, a key ingredient in this method is establishing the
regularity of a Poisson equation, which is done by combining the classical PDE
local regularity and a nice extension trick introduced by Gurvich [10].

the study of higher-order data models based on partitioning hypergraphs.
However, hypergraph partitioning admits multiple formulations as hyperedges can
be cut in multiple ways. Building upon a class of hypergraph partitioning
problems introduced by Li & Milenkovic, we study the problem of minimizing
ratio-cut objectives over hypergraphs given by a new class of cut functions,
monotone submodular cut functions (mscf's), which captures hypergraph expansion
and conductance as special cases.
  We first define the ratio-cut improvement problem, a family of local
relaxations of the minimum ratio-cut problem. This problem is a natural
extension of the Andersen & Lang cut improvement problem to the hypergraph
setting. We demonstrate the existence of efficient algorithms for approximately
solving this problem. These algorithms run in almost-linear time for the case
of hypergraph expansion, and when the hypergraph rank is at most $O(1)$.
  Next, we provide an efficient $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm for finding
the minimum ratio-cut of $G$. We generalize the cut-matching game framework of
Khandekar et. al. to allow for the cut player to play unbalanced cuts, and
matching player to route approximate single-commodity flows. Using this
framework, we bootstrap our algorithms for the ratio-cut improvement problem to
obtain approximation algorithms for minimum ratio-cut problem for all mscf's.
This also yields the first almost-linear time $O(\log n)$-approximation
algorithms for hypergraph expansion, and constant hypergraph rank.
  Finally, we extend a result of Louis & Makarychev to a broader set of
objective functions by giving a polynomial time $O\big(\sqrt{\log
n}\big)$-approximation algorithm for the minimum ratio-cut problem based on
rounding $\ell_2^2$-metric embeddings.

microwave sources at high frequencies produced by gyroresonant (GR) emission

coronal magnetic field on the line of sight. Although no coronal magnetic field
larger than roughly 2,000 G was expected, recently the field at least twice
larger has been reported. Here, we report a search for and statistical study of
such strong coronal magnetic fields using high-frequency GR emission. A

magnetic field are relatively rare (less than 1% of all active regions), they
appear regularly on the Sun. These active regions are associated with prominent
manifestations of solar activity.

critical role of point defects affecting device performance. One of the
powerful tools to study influence of defects on charge capture and
recombination processes is thermoluminescence. The popular models behind
thermoluminescence and carrier capture processes are semi-classic though. They
offer good qualitative description, but implicitly exclude quantum nature of
the accompanying parameters, such as frequency factors and capture cross
sections. As a consequence, results obtained for a specific host material
cannot be successfully extrapolated to other materials. Thus, the main purpose
of our work is to introduce a reliable analytical model that describes
non-radiative capture and release of electrons from/to the conduction band
(CB). The proposed model is governed by Bose-Einstein statistics (for phonon
occupation) and Fermi's golden rule (for resonant charge transfer between the
trap and the CB). The constructed model offers a physical interpretation of the
capture coefficients and frequency factors, and seamlessly includes the Coulomb
neutral/attractive nature of traps. It connects the frequency factor to the
overlap of wavefunctions of the delocalized CB and trap states, and suggests a
strong dependence on the density of charge distribution, i.e. the
ionicity/covalency of the chemical bonds within the host. Separation of the
resonance condition from the accumulation/dissipation of phonons on the site
leads to the conclusion that the capture cross-section does not necessarily
depend on the trap depth. The model is verified by comparison to reported
experimental data, showing good agreement. As such, the model generates
reliable information about trap states whose exact nature is not completely
understood and allows to do materials research in a more systematic way.

completely monotonic function based on the Gaussian quadrature with a variable
transformation. If the variable transformation is analytic on an open Bernstein
ellipse, the maximum absolute error decreases at least geometrically with
respect to the number of exponential functions. The error of the Gaussian

cosine function. The function is single-valued, meromorphic, and strictly

vibrational kinetics considered include levels up to v = 10 for CO, v = 59 for
N2 and up to v1 = 2 and v2 = v3 = 5, respectively for the symmetric stretch,
bending and asymmetric stretch modes of CO2, and account for electron-impact
excitation and de-excitation (e-V), vibration-to-translation (V-T) and
vibration-to-vibration energy exchange (V-V) processes. The kinetic scheme is
validated by comparing the model predictions with recent experimental data
measured in a DC glow discharge operating in pure CO2 and in CO2-N2 mixtures,
at pressures in the range 0.6 - 4 Torr (80.00 - 533.33 Pa) and a current of 50
mA. The experimental results show a higher vibrational temperature of the
different modes of CO2 and CO and an increased dissociation fraction of CO2,
that can reach values as high as 70%, when N2 is added to the plasma. On the
one hand, the simulations suggest that the former effect is the result of the
CO2-N2 and CO-N2 V-V transfers and the reduction of quenching due to the
decrease of atomic oxygen concentration; on the other hand, the dilution of CO2
and dissociation products, CO and O2, reduces the importance of back reactions
and contributes to the higher CO2 dissociation fraction with increased N2
content in the mixture, while the N2(B3Pg) electronically excited state further
enhances the CO2 dissociation.

""If X has not happend, Y would not heppend"". Existing CX approaches, however,
use classifier to explain features that can change its predictions. Thus, they
can only explain class-salient features, rather than entire object of interest.

SnS/graphene/monolayer SnS van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. Electronic
properties of all components of the vdW heterostructures are well preserved,
which reflects the weakness of the vdW interaction. In the cases of bilayer
SnS/graphene and bilayer SnS/bilayer graphene (AA-stacked), an Ohmic contact is
formed which can be turned first into p-type and then into n-type Schottky
contacts via application of an external electric field. Calculations show that
an Ohmic contact is also formed at the interface of bilayer SnS/bilayer
graphene (AB-stacked) heterostructure, but interestingly, by applying the
perpendicular electric field a transition from semimetal/semiconductor contact
to semiconductor/semiconductor one occurs which can enhance its optical
properties. Alternatively, in the monolayer SnS/graphene/monolayer SnS vdW
heterosructure, a p-type Schottky contact is established that changes into
Ohmic contact under an applied electric field. Our results clearly indicate
that the electronic properties of the vdW heterostructures can be tuned
efficiently by external electric field, which is important in designing of new
nanoelectronic devices.

interstellar gas that is readily accessible in absorption at radio/mm/sub-mm

hydrogen column densities N(H2) and N(H) = N(HI)+2N(H2) based on measurements
of HCO+ absorption and CO emission and absorption, and we compare these with
results obtained by others when observing HI, H2 and CO toward stars and AGN.
We consider the use of HCO+ as a proxy for H2 and show that the assumption of a
relative abundance N(H2) = N(HCO+)/3x10^{-9} gives the same view of the

advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAF's). When outflow is considered,
however, the first impression is that advection should be of opposite sign in
the inflow and the outflow, due to the opposite direction of radial motion.
Then how is the energy balance achieved simultaneously? We investigate the
problem in this paper, analysing the profiles of different components of
advection with self-similar solutions of ADAF's in spherical coordinates
($r\theta\phi$). We find that for $n < 3\gamma/2-1$, where $n$ is the density
index in $\rho \propto r^{-n}$ and $\gamma$ is the heat capacity ratio, the
radial advection is a heating mechanism in the inflow and a cooling mechanism
in the outflow. It becomes 0 for $n = 3\gamma/2-1$, and turns to a cooling
mechanism in the inflow and a heating mechanism in the outflow for $n >
3\gamma/2-1$. The energy conservation is only achieved when the latitudinal
($\theta$-direction) advection is considered, which takes an appropriate value
to maintain energy balance, so that the overall effect of advection, no matter
the parameter choices, is always a cooling mechanism that cancels out the
viscous heating everywhere. For the extreme case of $n=3/2$, latitudinal motion
stops, viscous heating is balanced solely by radial advection, and no outflow
is developed.

to the study of turbulent channel flow. It is shown that, as long as the
analysis is restricted to the system attractor, the PFO can be used to
differentiate causality and coherence from simple correlation without
performing interventional experiments, and that the key difficulty remains
collecting enough data to populate the operator matrix. This is alleviated by
limiting the analysis to two-dimensional projections of the phase space, and
developing a series of indicators to choose the best parameter pairs from a
large number of possibilities. The techniques thus developed are applied to the
study of bursting in the inertial layer of the channel, with emphasis on the
process by which bursts are reinitiated after they have decayed. Conditional
averaging over phase-space trajectories suggested by the PFO shows, somewhat
counter-intuitively, that a key ingredient for the burst recovery is the
development of a low-shear region near the wall, overlaid by a lifted shear
layer. This is confirmed by a computational experiment in which the control of
the mean velocity profile by the turbulence fluctuations is artificially
relaxed. The behaviour of the mean velocity profile is thus modified, but the
association of low wall shear with the initiation of the bursts is maintained.

inferred with a Transformer and then are input to a sequential extension of
Slot Attention to learn object-centric representations. In addition, Gaussian
processes are employed as priors of view latent variables for video generation

this thesis analyzes and refines an approach that associates a classical
geometry to a given matrix configuration, based on quasi-coherent states.
While, so far, the approach is only well understood for very specific cases, in
this work it is reviewed and implemented on a computer, allowing the numerical
investigation of deformations of these cases. It is proven that the classical
space can be made into a smooth manifold immersed into complex projective
space. Further, the necessity for the consideration of foliations thereof is
shown in order to deal with the observed and subsequently described phenomenon
called oxidation. The developed numerical methods allow the visualization of
the semiclassical limit as well as quantitative calculations. Explicit examples
suggest the stability under perturbations of the refined approach and highlight
the physical interpretation of the construction. All this supports a better
understanding of the geometrical content of arbitrary matrix configurations as

has complex microscopic organization involving both long-time trapping
phenomena on finite clusters and long-distance jumps along the lattice

the occurrence of degenerate states in the system; the latter are found to be a

three promising data-driven methods: Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks
(CANN), Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNN), and Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (NODE). Our formulation expands the strain energy potentials in terms
of sums of convex non-decreasing functions of invariants and linear
combinations of these. The expansion of the energy is shared across all three
methods and guarantees the automatic satisfaction of objectivity and
polyconvexity, essential within the context of hyperelasticity. To benchmark
the methods, we train them against rubber and skin stress-strain data. All
three approaches capture the data almost perfectly, without overfitting, and
have some capacity to extrapolate. Interestingly, the methods find different
energy functions even though the prediction on the stress data is nearly
identical. The most notable differences are observed in the second derivatives,
which could impact performance of numerical solvers. On the rich set of data
used in these benchmarks, the models show the anticipated trade-off between
number of parameters and accuracy. Overall, CANN, ICNN and NODE retain the
flexibility and accuracy of other data-driven methods without compromising on
the physics. These methods are thus ideal options to model arbitrary

function from $M$ to $A$. The definition allows an intuitive and
coordinate-free formulation of Newtonian mechanics, special relativity and
electromagnetism in terms of frames instead of coordinates. In particular, the
postulate of a set of charts on $M$ (an atlas) is replaced by the postulate of
a set of frames. Then the charts can be re-obtained through the choice of
affine coordinates. In addition, units enter the theory as elements of positive
spaces and we obtain a geometric and manifestly unit-independent reformulation.
Each frame allows us to identify spacetime with a 4-dimensional product-space
and we can generalize the definition of differentiable manifolds such that the
frames turn out to form an atlas. Then the only difference between Newtonian
mechanics and special relativity is the assumed type of transition functions -
Galilean transformations or Poincar\'e transformations between affine spaces.
This allows us to highlight the common features and differences in the second
chapter of the paper. For example, we define velocity reciprocity in
mathematical terms and prove the phenomenon for both kind of transformations.
The chapter concludes with a discussion of inertial and accelerated frames. In
the third chapter we restrict our attention to the reformulation of special
relativity and electromagnetism with a strong emphasis on covariance. World
lines are introduced as particular subsets of spacetime, the proper time of
world line is defined as an affine structure on the world line and the

Here, we introduce the reinforcement learning reduced-order estimator (RL-ROE),

measurements is given by a nonlinear policy trained through reinforcement
learning. The nonlinearity of the policy enables the RL-ROE to compensate
efficiently for errors of the ROM, while still taking advantage of the
imperfect knowledge of the dynamics. Using examples involving the Burgers and

  Tuning","9 pages, 8 figures, to appear in IEEE NOMS 2023",,,,"cs.NI cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Future generations of mobile networks are expected to contain more and more
antennas with growing complexity and more parameters. Optimizing these
parameters is necessary for ensuring the good performance of the network. The
scale of mobile networks makes it challenging to optimize antenna parameters
using manual intervention or hand-engineered strategies. Reinforcement learning
is a promising technique to address this challenge but existing methods often
use local optimizations to scale to large network deployments. We propose a new
multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize mobile network
configurations globally. By using a value decomposition approach, our algorithm
can be trained from a global reward function instead of relying on an ad-hoc
decomposition of the network performance across the different cells. The
algorithm uses a graph neural network architecture which generalizes to
different network topologies and learns coordination behaviors. We empirically
demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on an antenna tilt tuning problem
and a joint tilt and power control problem in a simulated environment.

solitons. We characterize the compact generalized gradient Ricci-Yamabe soliton
and find certain conditions under which the scalar curvature becomes constant.
The estimation of Ricci curvature is deduced and also an isometry theorem is
found in gradient Ricci-Yamabe soliton satisfying a finite weighted Dirichlet
integral. Further, it is proved that a Ricci-Yamabe soliton reduces to an
Einstein manifold when the potential vector field becomes concircular.
Moreover, the eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenspace of the Ricci operator
are also discussed in case of a Ricci-Yamabe soliton with concircular potential

beliefs over the signals of interest and an accurate description of their
manifestation into noisy measurements. Handcrafted signal priors based on e.g.
sparsity are increasingly replaced by data-driven deep generative models, and
several groups have recently shown that state-of-the-art score-based diffusion
models yield particularly strong performance and flexibility. In this paper, we
show that the powerful paradigm of posterior sampling with diffusion models can
be extended to include rich, structured, noise models. To that end, we propose
a joint conditional reverse diffusion process with learned scores for the noise
and signal-generating distribution. We demonstrate strong performance gains
across various inverse problems with structured noise, outperforming
competitive baselines that use normalizing flows and adversarial networks. This
opens up new opportunities and relevant practical applications of diffusion
modeling for inverse problems in the context of non-Gaussian measurement
models.

  correlation networks, Agent-state construction",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  State construction from sensory observations is an important component of a
reinforcement learning agent. One solution for state construction is to use
recurrent neural networks. Back-propagation through time (BPTT), and real-time
recurrent learning (RTRL) are two popular gradient-based methods for recurrent
learning. BPTT requires the complete sequence of observations before computing
gradients and is unsuitable for online real-time updates. RTRL can do online
updates but scales poorly to large networks. In this paper, we propose two
constraints that make RTRL scalable. We show that by either decomposing the
network into independent modules, or learning the network incrementally, we can
make RTRL scale linearly with the number of parameters. Unlike prior scalable
gradient estimation algorithms, such as UORO and Truncated-BPTT, our algorithms
do not add noise or bias to the gradient estimate. Instead, they trade-off the
functional capacity of the network to achieve scalable learning. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach over Truncated-BPTT on a benchmark inspired
by animal learning and by doing policy evaluation for pre-trained Rainbow-DQN
agents in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE).

related unitarity issues in the CKM matrix. It is not a comprehensive and
unbiased compilation of all historic data and studies, but rather a focus on
compelling evidence leading to new physics. In particular, the largely
overlooked nuances of different techniques applied in material and magnetic
trap experiments are clarified. Further detailed analysis shows that the
``beam'' approach of neutron lifetime measurements is likely to give the
``true'' $\beta$-decay lifetime, while discrepancies in ``bottle'' measurements
indicate new physics at play. The most feasible solution to these puzzles is a
newly proposed ordinary-mirror neutron ($n-n'$) oscillation model under the
framework of mirror matter theory. This phenomenological model is reviewed and
introduced, and its explanations of the neutron lifetime anomaly and possible
non-unitarity of the CKM matrix are presented. Most importantly, various new
experimental proposals, especially lifetime measurements with small/narrow
magnetic traps or under super-strong magnetic fields, are discussed in order to
test the surprisingly large anomalous signals that are uniquely predicted by
this new $n-n'$ oscillation model.

theory at very high energies. In particular for photons of very high energy. We
start by introducing the anisotropic gravity-gauge vector field model. It is
invariant under spacelike diffeomorphisms, time parametrization, and U(1) gauge
transformations. It includes high-order spacelike derivatives as well as
polynomial expressions of the Riemann and field strength tensor fields. It is
based on the Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz anisotropic proposal. We show its consistency,
and the stability of the Minkowski ground state. Finally, we determine the
exact zone at which the physical degrees of freedom, i.e. the
transverse-traceless tensorial degrees of freedom and the transverse vectorial
degrees of freedom propagate according to a linear wave equation. This is so,
in spite of the fact that there exists in the zone a non-trivial Newtonian
background of the same order. The wave equation contains spatial derivatives up
to the sixth order, in the lowest order it exactly matches the relativistic
wave equation. We then analyze the dispersion relation at very high energies in
the context of recent experimental data. The qualitative predictions of the
proposed model, concerning the propagation of highly energetic photons, are
different from the ones obtained from the modified dispersion relation of the
LIV models.

number of Italian sentences taken from poetry domain. The experiments are
organized on the hypothesis of a very high level of difficulty in
predictability at the three levels of linguistic complexity that we intend to
monitor: lexical, syntactic and semantic level. To test this hypothesis we ran
the Italian version of BERT with 80 sentences for a total of 900 tokens mostly
extracted from Italian poetry of the first half of last century. Then we
alternated canonical and noncanonical versions of the same sentence before
processing them with the same DL model. We used then sentences from the
newswire domain containing similar syntactic structures. The results show that
the DL model is highly sensitive to presence of noncanonical structures.
However, DLs are also very sensitive to word frequency and to local non literal
meaning compositional effect. This is also apparent by the preference for
predicting function vs content words, collocates vs infrequent word phrases. In
the paper, we focused our attention on the use of subword units done by BERT
for out of vocabulary words.

manganese, cobalt, zinc, nickel, magnesium and iron. In this research, first,
magnetic Zn0.3Fe0.6O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrothermal method in
the presence of citric acid as a reducing agent. In order to reduce the amount
of impurity and obtain the pure spinel phase and reduce the size of magnetic
nanoparticles, the hydrothermal process was carried out in the presence of
different concentrations of the reducing agent and pH level of the medium. The
structural investigations of the resulting nanoparticles were carried out by

showed that in order to obtain pure and single-phase spinel nanoparticles with

data, traditional single-server architectures are no longer sufficient to
handle the massive amounts of data storage, transfer, and various file system

address the scalability challenges of file systems. One such popular
distributed file system is Lustre, which is extensively used in
high-performance computing environments. Lustre offers parallel file access,
allowing multiple clients to access and store data simultaneously. However, in
order to ensure the security and integrity of data, auditing plays a crucial
role. Lustre auditing serves as a proof of security and enables the
implementation of robust security features such as authentication with
Kerberos, mandatory access control with SELinux, isolation, and more. Auditing
helps track and monitor file system activities, providing valuable insights
into user actions, system events, and potential security breaches. The
objective of this project is to explore Lustre auditing using CentOS, a popular
Linux distribution, within a Lustre architecture. By implementing Lustre
auditing, we aim to enhance the security and reliability of the file system.
Additionally, we plan to develop a graphical interface that presents the
auditing features in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner. This
interface will provide administrators and users with a convenient way to
monitor and analyze auditing logs, view access patterns, detect anomalies, and
ensure compliance with security policies. By combining the power of Lustre's

exploit complementary information across multiple data views. Although existing
methods demonstrate delightful clustering performance, most of them are of high
time complexity and cannot handle large-scale data. Matrix factorization-based
models are a representative of solving this problem. However, they assume that
the views share a dimension-fixed consensus coefficient matrix and
view-specific base matrices, limiting their representability. Moreover, a
series of large-scale algorithms that bear one or more hyperparameters are
impractical in real-world applications. To address the two issues, we propose
an auto-weighted multi-view clustering (AWMVC) algorithm. Specifically, AWMVC
first learns coefficient matrices from corresponding base matrices of different
dimensions, then fuses them to obtain an optimal consensus matrix. By mapping
original features into distinctive low-dimensional spaces, we can attain more
comprehensive knowledge, thus obtaining better clustering results. Moreover, we
design a six-step alternative optimization algorithm proven to be convergent
theoretically. Also, AWMVC shows excellent performance on various benchmark
datasets compared with existing ones. The code of AWMVC is publicly available

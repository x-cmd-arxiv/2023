suitable for future power electronics devices while quartz-like GeO2 shows

and fundamental materials investigations, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a
well-suited thin film growth technique. In this study, we investigate the
reaction kinetics of GeO2 during plasma-assisted MBE using elemental Ge and
plasma-activated oxygen fluxes. The growth rate as a function of oxygen flux is
measured in-situ by laser reflectometry at different growth temperatures. A
flux of the suboxide GeO desorbing off the growth surface is identified and
quantified in-situ by the line-of-sight quadrupole mass spectrometry. Our
measurements reveal that the suboxide formation and desorption limits the
growth rate under metal-rich or high temperature growth conditions, and leads
to etching of the grown GeO2 layer under Ge flux in the absence of oxygen. The
quantitative results fit the sub-compound mediated reaction model, indicating
the intermediate formation of the suboxide at the growth front. This model is
further utilized to delineate the GeO2-growth window in terms of oxygen-flux
and substrate temperature. Our study can serve as a guidance for the thin film
synthesis of GeO2 and defect-free mesa etching in future GeO2-device

capabilities of generating realistic data and facilitating advanced
decision-making processes, enhances various applications when combined with
vehicular networks, such as navigation optimization, traffic prediction, data
generation, and evaluation. Despite these promising applications, the
integration of generative AI with vehicular networks faces several challenges,
such as real-time data processing and decision-making, adapting to dynamic and
unpredictable environments, as well as privacy and security concerns. To
address these challenges, we propose a multi-modality semantic-aware framework
to enhance the service quality of generative AI. By leveraging multi-modal and
semantic communication technologies, the framework enables the use of text and
image data for creating multi-modal content, providing more reliable guidance
to receiving vehicles and ultimately improving system usability and efficiency.
To further improve the reliability and efficiency of information transmission
and reconstruction within the framework, taking generative AI-enabled
vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) as a case study, a deep reinforcement learning
(DRL)-based approach is proposed for resource allocation. Finally, we discuss
potential research directions and anticipated advancements in the field of
generative AI-enabled vehicular networks.

urbanization. Urban development decreases infiltration by reducing pervious
areas and increases the accumulation of pollutants during dry weather. During
wet weather events, there is an increase in the levels of pollution
concentrations and stormwater runoff that eventually reach creeks and rivers.
Polluted stormwater runoff may be sources of water supply. Modeling the
quantity and quality dynamics of stormwater runoff requires a coupled
hydrodynamic module capable of estimating the transport and fate of pollutants.
In this paper, we evaluate the applicability of a distributed hydrodynamic
model coupled with a water quality model (HydroPol2D). First, the model is
compared to GSSHA and WCA2D in the V-Tilted catchment, and the limitation of
the critical velocity of WCA2D is investigated. We also applied the model in a
laboratory wooden board catchment, focusing on the validation of the numerical
approach to simulate water quality dynamics. Then, we apply HydroPol2D in the
Tijuco Preto catchment, in Sao Carlos - Brazil, and compare the modeling
results with the full momentum solver of the Hydrologic Engineering Center -
River System Analysis (HEC-RAS). The model implementation, the governing
equations, and the estimation of input data are discussed, indicating the
challenges and opportunities of the application of distributed models in
poorly-gauged catchments. For a 1-yr return period of rainfall and antecedent
dry days and assuming an uncertainty of $40\%$ in the water quality parameters,
the results indicate that the maximum concentration of total suspended solids

that combines fine-grained communication with partitioned communication to
improve application run-time. Communication is divided among the compute
threads such that each individual thread can initiate transmission of its
portion of the data as soon as it is complete rather than waiting for all of
the threads. However, the benefit of early-bird communication depends on the
completion timing of the individual threads. In this paper, we measure and
evaluate the potential overlap, the idle time each thread experiences between
finishing their computation and the final thread finishing. These measurements
help us understand whether a given application could benefit from early-bird
communication. We present our technique for gathering this data and evaluate
data collected from three proxy applications: MiniFE, MiniMD, and MiniQMC. To
characterize the behavior of these workloads, we study the thread timings at
both a macro level, i.e., across all threads across all runs of an application,
and a micro level, i.e., within a single process of a single run. We observe
that these applications exhibit significantly different behavior. While MiniFE
and MiniQMC appear to be well-suited for early-bird communication because of
their wider thread distribution and more frequent laggard threads, the behavior
of MiniMD may limit its ability to leverage early-bird communication.

both directions. Upon migrating from one country to the other, scientists
continue to collaborate frequently with the origin country. Although the number
of collaborations between the two countries has been increasing since the dawn

impactful when collaborating than when each of them works without the other.

inspiration from the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). It
divides the challenging task of posterior sampling into two simpler sampling
problems. The first problem depends on the likelihood function, while the
second is interpreted as a Bayesian denoising problem that can be readily
carried out by a deep generative model. Specifically, for an illustrative
purpose, the proposed method is implemented in this paper using
state-of-the-art diffusion-based generative models. Akin to its deterministic
PnP-based counterparts, the proposed method exhibits the great advantage of not
requiring an explicit choice of the prior distribution, which is rather encoded
into a pre-trained generative model. However, unlike optimization methods
(e.g., PnP-ADMM) which generally provide only point estimates, the proposed
approach allows conventional Bayesian estimators to be accompanied by
confidence intervals at a reasonable additional computational cost. Experiments
on commonly studied image processing problems illustrate the efficiency of the
proposed sampling strategy. Its performance is compared to recent

2D orthogonal kV images, taken at fixed, oblique angles, as no 3D on-the-bed
imaging is available. The visibility of the tumor in kV images is limited since
the patient's 3D anatomy is projected onto a 2D plane, especially when the
tumor is behind high-density structures such as bones. This can lead to large
patient setup errors. A solution is to reconstruct the 3D CT image from the kV
images obtained at the treatment isocenter in the treatment position.
  Methods: An asymmetric autoencoder-like network built with vision-transformer
blocks was developed. The data was collected from 1 head and neck patient: 2
orthogonal kV images (1024x1024 voxels), 1 3D CT with padding (512x512x512)
acquired from the in-room CT-on-rails before kVs were taken and 2
digitally-reconstructed-radiograph (DRR) images (512x512) based on the CT. We
resampled kV images every 8 voxels and DRR and CT every 4 voxels, thus formed a
dataset consisting of 262,144 samples, in which the images have a dimension of
128 for each direction. In training, both kV and DRR images were utilized, and
the encoder was encouraged to learn the jointed feature map from both kV and
DRR images. In testing, only independent kV images were used. The full-size
synthetic CT (sCT) was achieved by concatenating the sCTs generated by the
model according to their spatial information. The image quality of the
synthetic CT (sCT) was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE) and
per-voxel-absolute-CT-number-difference volume histogram (CDVH).
  Results: The model achieved a speed of 2.1s and a MAE of <40HU. The CDVH
showed that <5% of the voxels had a per-voxel-absolute-CT-number-difference
larger than 185 HU.
  Conclusion: A patient-specific vision-transformer-based network was developed
and shown to be accurate and efficient to reconstruct 3D CT images from kV
images.

We study the out-of-time order correlator (OTOC) in the infinite-temperature

the DHS OTOC and show that the OTOC can grow super-exponentially in the large
$N$ limit, due to the fast dynamics in an unbounded phase space. By a similar
mechanism, the Krylov complexity grows explosively. We also study the
entanglement growth in a quantum quench from a DHS product state, i.e., one of
non-aligned spins that resemble the DHS infinite-temperature ensemble with
respect to the statistics of the collective spins. Using a field-theoretical
method, We exactly calculate the entanglement entropy in the large $N$ limit.

are known to shift in latitude on various timescales, but the physical
processes that cause these shifts are still unclear. In this study, we
introduce a minimal dynamical system derived from the classical Phillips
two-level model with the goal of elucidating the essential mechanisms
responsible for the interaction between eddies and mean flow. Specifically, we
aim to understand the link between the structure of the eddies and the shift of
the latitudinal maximum of the zonal flow. By varying the horizontal shape of
the eddies, we find three distinct dynamical regimes whose occurrence depends
on the intensity of the external baroclinic forcing: a purely zonal flow, a
barotropic eddy regime with net poleward momentum flux, and a baroclinic eddy
regime with both net poleward momentum and temperature flux. For weak
baroclinic forcing, the classical zonal flow solution with latitudinal maximum
at the centre of the beta-channel is found. For strong forcing, if eddies are
southwest-northeast tilted and zonally elongated, the system is in the
baroclinic eddy regime, resulting in a poleward shift of the jet. The
intermediate barotropic eddy regime also features a poleward shifted jet, yet
with eddies structurally distinct from the baroclinic regime. Changing the
parameters yields transitions between the regimes that can be either continuous
or discontinuous in terms of the properties of the atmosphere. The findings of
this study also provide insights into the properties of the storm track change
between the jet entrance and jet exit regions of the North Atlantic.

The experimental results showed for the first time that the mean trajectory

  Education: A Research Based report on classroom practice",,,,,"physics.ed-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Background: Context Based Science Education (CBSE) has a long-standing
tradition and is discussed as a highly promising approach in science education.
It is supposed that CBSE can foster pupils engagement and learning. However,
classroom implementations of CBSE based on solid empirical evidence are
surprisingly scarce.
  Purpose: The present research-based report of practice seeks to bridge this
theory practice gap for some specific forms of CBSE. We examine the use of
science problems based on newspaper articles and the real-life contexts they
provide (newspaper story problems, NSP).
  Design and Methods: While the research background has been reported
elsewhere, the main objective of the present contribution is to provide a
detailed account of the practical aspects of the approach. Two concrete,
curriculum-relevant classroom teaching experiments based on newspaper story
problems are reported, combined with a quasi-experimental study comparing NSPs
against conventional textbook problems. The implementation of the teaching
learning sequence in classroom practice is described in detail. Additionally,
tasks types similar to NSPs, but using other ways of contextualisation (e.g.
advertisements) will be discussed as perspective.
  Results: A considerable improvement in motivation was found, which proved
stable at least in the medium term. Learning turned out to also be fostered to
a sizeable extent, including the educationally important issue of transfer.
  Conclusions: The use of NSPs as a form of CBSE can have large positive,
robust, and sustainable effects of both motivation and learning. Being flexible
and practical to implement, they appear thus highly suited to classroom
application. In perspective, a series of similar forms of tasks implementing
CBSE is presented, such as by experimental of aesthetic contexts.

evolution of accretion flow onto PNS until the system reaches a steady state. A
standing shock wave is commonly formed in the accretion flow, whereas the shock
radius varies depending on mass accretion rate and PNS mass. A sharp increase
in temperature emerges in the vicinity of PNS ($\sim 10$ km), which
characterizes neutrino emission. Both neutrino luminosity and average energy
become higher with increasing mass accretion rate and PNS mass. The mean energy
of emitted neutrinos is in the range of
$10\lesssim\epsilon\lesssim20\,\mathrm{MeV}$, which is higher than that
estimated from PNS cooling models ($\lesssim10\,\mathrm{MeV}$). Assuming a
distance to core-collapse supernova of $10\,\mathrm{kpc}$, we quantify neutrino
event rates for Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) and DUNE. The estimated detection
rates are well above the background, and their energy-dependent features are
qualitatively different from those expected from PNS cooling models. Another
notable feature is that the neutrino emission is strongly flavor dependent,
exhibiting that the neutrino event rate hinges on the neutrino oscillation
model. We estimate them in the case with adiabatic Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein
model, and show that the normal- and inverted mass hierarchy offer the large
number of neutrino detection in Super-K and DUNE, respectively. Hence the
simultaneous observation with Super-K and DUNE of the fallback neutrinos will
provide a strong constraint on neutrino mass hierarchy.

exponents of thermodynamic derivatives of the free energy such as pressure,
bulk and shear moduli, can be consolidated by introducing a universal scaling
function with two branches. Both the original analysis and the scaling theory
assume that the system always resides in a single basis in the energy
landscape. The two branches are separated by a line $T^*(\Delta \phi)$ in the
$T-\Delta \phi$ plane, where $\Delta \phi=\phi-\phi_c^\Lambda$ is the deviation
of the packing fraction from its critical, jamming value, $\phi_c^\Lambda$, for
that basin. The branch for $T<T^*(\Delta \phi)$ reduces at $T=0$ to an earlier
scaling ansatz that is restricted to $T=0$, $\Delta \phi \ge 0$, while the
branch for $T>T^*(\Delta \phi)$ reproduces exponents observed for thermal hard
spheres. In contrast to the usual scenario for critical phenomena, the two
branches are characterized by different exponents. We suggest that this unusual
feature can be resolved by the existence of a dangerous irrelevant variable
$u$, which can appear to modify exponents if the leading $u=0$ term is
sufficiently small in the regime described by one of the two branches of the
scaling function.

not re-sampled for each partial unroll). Compared to PES, ES-Single is simpler
to implement and has lower variance: the variance of ES-Single is constant with
respect to the number of truncated unrolls, removing a key barrier in applying
ES to long inner problems using short truncations. We show that ES-Single is
unbiased for quadratic inner problems, and demonstrate empirically that its
variance can be substantially lower than that of PES. ES-Single consistently
outperforms PES on a variety of tasks, including a synthetic benchmark task,
hyperparameter optimization, training recurrent neural networks, and training

varying the electron-electron interaction strength. Here we report the
numerical investigation of the emergence of the Haldane state and its edge
modes in a system of interacting electrons - the two-orbital Hubbard model -
with increasing repulsion strength $U$. We show that these interactions not
only form the magnetic moments but also form a topologically nontrivial
fermionic many-body ground-state with zero-energy edges states that only at
very large $U$ converge to the Haldane chain model. Specifically, upon
increasing the strength of the Hubbard repulsion and Hund exchange, we identify
a novel sharp transition point separating topologically trivial and nontrivial
ground-states. Surprisingly, the latter appears already at rather small values
of the interaction $U$, in a regime where the magnetic moments are barely
developed, thus generalizing the ideas of Haldane for $\mathcal{S}=1$ spin
Heisenberg models into previously unexplored territory involving delocalized
electrons. Furthermore, our results indicate that the topological regime can be
described by a liquid valence bonds state down to interaction strength of the

the Hubble rate and $\nu_{\rm eff}$ is a (small) free parameter. This dynamical
scenario is grounded on recent studies of quantum field theory (QFT) in curved
spacetime and also on string theory. It turns out that what we call the
`cosmological constant', $\Lambda$, is no longer a rigid parameter but the
nearly sustained value of $8\pi G(H)\rho_{\rm vac}(H)$ around (any) given epoch
$H(t)$, where $G(H)$ is the gravitational coupling, which can also be very
mildly running (logarithmically). Of particular interest is the possibility
suggested in past works that such a running may help to cure the cosmological
tensions afflicting the $\Lambda$CDM. In the current study, we reanalyze it in
full and we find it becomes further buttressed. Using the modern cosmological
data, namely a compilation of the latest $SNIa+BAO+$H(z)$+LSS+CMB$
observations, we probe to which extent the RVM provides a quality fit better
than the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model, paying particular emphasis on its
impact on the $\sigma_8$ and $H_0$ tensions. We utilize the Einstein-Boltzmann
system solver $CLASS$ and the Monte Carlo sampler $MontePython$ for the
statistical analysis, as well as the statistical $DIC$ criterion to compare the
running vacuum against the rigid vacuum ($\nu_{\rm eff} = 0$). We show that
with a tiny amount of vacuum dynamics ($|\nu_{\rm eff}|\ll 1$) the global fit
can improve significantly with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM and the mentioned
tensions may subside to inconspicuous levels.

drawing motivation in part from the axiverse of string theory. Axion-like
particles can also arise as composite degrees of freedom of a dark sector, for
example, as dark pions in dark Quantum Chromo-Dynamics. In a dark Standard
Model (SM) wherein all 6 quark flavors are light while the photon is massive,
one finds a rich low-energy spectrum of stable and ultralight particles, in the
form of neutral and charged dark scalars, and complex neutral scalars analogous
to the SM kaon, with mass splittings determined by the mass and charge of the
dark quarks. The model finds a natural portal to the visible sector via kinetic
coupling of the dark and visible photons, and consequent millicharges for dark
matter. The dark matter can be a mixture of all these ultralight bosonic
degrees of freedom, and exhibit both parity-even and parity-odd interactions,
making the theory testable at a wide variety of experiments. In context of dark
QCD with $N_f$ flavors of light quarks, this scenario predicts $N_f^2-1$
ultralight axion-like particles -- effectively an axiverse from dark QCD. This
'$\pi$-axiverse' is consistent with but makes no recourse to string theory, and
is complementary to the conventional string theory axiverse.

especially at the small radii of most relevant for lensing perturbations. Using
a characteristic radius, $R_{-1}$, where the log slope of surface density is
equal to $-1$, and an associated surface density, $\Sigma_{-1}$, we can
represent the expected lensing signal from line-of-sight halos statistically,
for an ensemble of halo orientations, using a distribution of {\em projected
concentration} parameters, $\mathcal{C}_{\rm vir} := r_{\rm vir}/ R_{-1}$.
Though an individual halo can have a projected concentration that varies with

correlates with the usual three-dimensional halo concentration in a way that
enables ease of use.

and grain size distribution. Such parameters are related to intrinsic galaxy
properties such as metallicity, star formation rate, and stellar age. Due to
the lack of observational constraints at high redshift, dust empirical curves
measured in the local Universe (e.g. Calzetti and SMC curves) have been
employed to describe the dust attenuation at early epochs. We exploit the high
sensitivity and spectral resolution of the JWST to constrain the dust
attenuation curves in high-z galaxies. Our goals are to check whether dust
attenuation curves evolve with redshift and quantify the dependence of the
inferred galaxy properties on the assumed dust attenuation law. We develop a
modified version of the SED fitting code BAGPIPES by including a detailed dust
attenuation curve parametrization. Dust parameters are derived, along with
galaxy properties, from the fit to the data from FUV to mm bands. Once applied
to three star-forming galaxies at z = 7-8, we find that their attenuation
curves differ from local templates. One out of three galaxies shows a
characteristic MW bump, typically associated to the presence of small
carbonaceous dust grains such as PAHs. This is one of the first evidences
suggesting the presence of PAHs in early galaxies. Galaxy properties such as
stellar mass and SFR inferred from SED fitting are strongly affected by the
assumed attenuation curve, though the adopted star formation history also plays
a major role. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for the
potential diversity of dust attenuation laws when analyzing the properties of
galaxies at the EoR, whose dust properties are still poorly understood. The
application of our method to a larger sample of galaxies observed with JWST can
provide us important insights into the properties of dust and galaxies in the
early universe.

cosmological distances. The nature of their progenitors is still under debate,
although magnetars are invoked by most models. The FRB-magnetar connection was
strengthened by the discovery of an FRB-like event from the Galactic magnetar
SGR J1935+215. In this work, we aim to investigate how prevalent are magnetars
like SGR~J1935+2154 within FRB progenitors. We carried out an FRB search in a
sample of seven nearby (< 12 Mpc) galaxies with the Northern Cross radio
telescope for a total of 692 h. We detected one 1.8~ms burst in the direction
of M101 with fluence of $58 \pm 5$ Jy ms. Its dispersion measure of 303 pc
cm$^{-3}$ places it most-likely beyond M101. Considering no significant
detection coming indisputably from the selected galaxies, we place a 38
yr$^{-1}$ upper limit on the total - i.e., including the whole sample - burst
rate at the 95\% confidence level. This upper limit constrains $\lambda_{\rm
mag} < 0.42$~magnetar$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ or, if combined with literature
observations of a similar sample of nearby galaxies, it yields a joint
constraint of $\lambda_{\rm mag} < 0.25$ magnetar$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$. We also
provide the first constraints on the expected rate of FRBs hypothetically
originating from ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) sources, since some of the galaxies
observed during our observational campaign host confirmed ULXs. We obtain $<
13$ yr$^{-1}$ per ULX on the total sample of galaxies observed. Our results
indicate that bursts with energies $E > 10^{34}$ erg from magnetars like
SGR~J1935+2154 appear more rare compared to previous observations, and further
disfavours them as unique progenitors for the cosmological FRB population,
leaving more space open to the contribution from a population of more exotic
magnetars, not born via core-collapsed supernovae.

modes/rates that most directly control signal event rates and kinematics. In
particular, taking the example of long-lived particles that decay inside a
neutrino detector as a test case, we study formulate and study simplified
frameworks in the context of light scalars/fermions produced in kaon decays
which then decay into final states containing an electron-positron pair. We
show that using these simplified frameworks can allow for individual
experimental analyses to be applicable to a wide variety of specific model
scenarios. As a side benefit, we demonstrate that using this approach can allow
for the T2K collaboration, by reinterpreting its search for Heavy Neutral
Leptons, to be capable of setting world-leading limits on the Higgs-Portal
Scalar model. Furthermore, we argue the simplified framework interpretation can
serve as a bridge to model identification in the hopeful detection of a
new-physics signal. As an illustration, we perform a first determination of the
likelihood that, in the presence of a new-physics signal in a detector like the
DUNE ND-GAr, multiple different new-physics hypotheses (such as the
Higgs-Portal Scalar and Heavy Neutral Lepton ones) can be disentangled. We
demonstrate that this model discrimination is favorable for some portions of
detectable new-physics parameter space but for others, it is more challenging.

  turbulence","MNRAS Letters submitted (December 21, 2022); 6 pages, 4 figures",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is a kinematically unusual environment
relative to the Galactic disc, with high velocity dispersions and a steep
size-linewidth relation of the molecular clouds. In addition, the CMZ region
has a significantly lower star formation rate (SFR) than expected by its large
amount of dense gas. An important factor in explaining the low SFR is the
turbulent state of the star-forming gas, which seems to be dominated by
rotational modes. However, the turbulence driving mechanism remains unclear. In
this work, we investigate how the Galactic gravitational potential affects the
turbulence in CMZ clouds. We demonstrate that several kinematic properties of
the CMZ cloud G0.253+0.016 (`the Brick') arise naturally in a cloud-scale
hydrodynamics simulation that takes into account the Galactic gravitational
potential. These properties include the line-of-sight velocity distribution,
the steepened size-linewidth relation, and the predominantly solenoidal nature
of the turbulence. Within the simulation, these properties result from the
Galactic shear in combination with the cloud's gravitational collapse. This is
a strong indication that the Galactic gravitational potential plays a crucial
role in shaping the CMZ gas kinematics, and is a major contributor to
suppressing the SFR by inducing predominantly solenoidal turbulent modes.

exponential suppression of the dipole tunneling rate. However, we find that
polaronic multi-photon resonances restore fast relaxation by a cavity-mediated
dipole resonant tunneling process. Aside of the numerical evidences, we develop
a fully analytical description by diagonalizing the Rabi model through a
generalized rotating-wave approximation, valid in the so-called polaron frame.
The relaxation physics of such ultrastrong-coupling systems is then reduced to
a multi-photon polaron version of the standard text-book dressed states

when the first galaxies formed. Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission from galaxies
is currently our most promising probe of these early stages. At z>7 the
majority of galaxies detected with Ly$\alpha$ are in candidate overdensities.
Here we quantify the probability of these galaxies residing in large ionised
bubbles. We create (1.6 Gpc)$^3$ reionising intergalactic medium (IGM)
simulations, providing sufficient volume to robustly measure bubble size
distributions around UV-bright galaxies and rare overdensities. We find $M_{\rm
UV} \lesssim -16$ galaxies and overdensities are $\gtrsim$10-1000x more likely
to trace ionised bubbles compared to randomly selected positions. The brightest
galaxies and strongest overdensities have bubble size distributions with
highest characteristic size and least scatter. We compare two models: gradual
reionisation driven by numerous UV-faint galaxies versus more rapid
reionisation by rarer brighter galaxies, producing larger bubbles at fixed
neutral fraction. We demonstrate that recently observed z~7 overdensities are
highly likely to trace large ionised bubbles, corroborated by their high
Ly$\alpha$ detection rates. However, the z~8.7 association of Ly$\alpha$
emitters in EGS and GN-z11, with Ly$\alpha$ at z=10.6, are unlikely to trace
large bubbles in our fiducial model -- 11% and 7% probability of >1 proper Mpc
bubbles, respectively. Ly$\alpha$ detections at such high redshifts could be
explained by: a less neutral IGM than previously expected; larger ionised
regions at fixed neutral fraction; or if intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ flux is unusually
strong in these galaxies. We discuss how to test these scenarios with JWST and
the prospects for using upcoming wide-area surveys to distinguish between
reionisation models.

found a recent ($\sim63$ Myr) metal-rich (1.6 Z$_{\odot}$) residual star
formation in the centre of the galaxy. A dust lane with a peak extinction in
the V band of 0.65 mag is seen. No signs of ordered stellar motion are found

profile varying significantly along the FoV. Mg$_2$ shows a shallow gradient,

mainly due to the high dimensionality of the encountered problems. Recently, a
Bayesian uncertainty quantification by optimization (BUQO) has been proposed to
formulate hypothesis testing as a minimization problem. The objective is to
determine whether a structure appearing in a maximum a posteriori estimate is
true or is a reconstruction artifact due to the ill-posedness or
ill-conditioness of the problem. In this context, the mathematical definition
of having a ``fake structure"" is crucial, and highly depends on the type of
structure of interest. This definition can be interpreted as an inpainting of a
neighborhood of the structure, but only simple techniques have been proposed in
the literature so far, due to the complexity of the problem. In this work, we
propose a data-driven method using a simple convolutional neural network to
perform the inpainting task, leading to a novel plug-and-play BUQO algorithm.
Compared to previous works, the proposed approach has the advantage that it can
be used for a wide class of structures, without needing to adapt the inpainting
operator to the area of interest. In addition, we show through simulations on
magnetic resonance imaging, that compared to the original BUQO's hand-crafted
inpainting procedure, the proposed approach provides greater qualitative output
images. Python code will be made available for reproducibility upon acceptance

that the instantaneous eigenspectra can be used to understand the quantization

projectile and grain properties (diameter, density, friction and packing
fraction) for different available energies (within relatively small values). We
found that a denser region forms below the projectile, pushing it back and
causing its rebound by the end of its motion, and that solid friction affects
considerably the crater morphology. Besides, we show that the penetration

already beginning to establish itself in the \emph{Tractatus}"" (\emph{The False
Prison}, 1987). From the latter to the former, Stephen Hilmy's (\emph{The Later
Wittgenstein}, 1987) extensive study of the \emph{Nachlass} has helped removing
classical misconceptions such as Hintikka's claim that ``Wittgenstein in the
\emph{Philosophical Investigations} almost completely gave up the calculus
analogy."" Hilmy points out that even in the \emph{Investigations} one finds the
use of the calculus/game paradigm to the understanding of language, such as
``in operating with the word"" (Part I, \S 559) and ``it plays a different part
in the calculus"". Hilmy also quotes from a late (1946) unpublished manuscript
(MS 130) ``this sentence has use in the calculus of language""), which seems to
be compatible with ``asking whether and how a proposition can be verified is
only a particular way of asking `How do you mean?'."" Central in this back and
forth there is an aspect which seems to deserve attention in the discussion of
a semantics for the language of mathematics which might be based on
(normalisation of) proofs and/or Hintikka/Lorenzen game-dialogue: the
explication of consequences. Such a discussion is substantially supported by
the use of the open and searchable \emph{The Wittgenstein Archives at the

belief of OOIs and plans the motion of robots to maximize the information
quality. Mobility of robots enables the behavior of pursuing better visibility,
which is constrained by sensor field of view (FoV) and occlusion objects. We
first extend prior work to detect, maintain and share occlusion information
explicitly, allowing us to generate occlusion-aware planning even if a priori
semantic occlusion information is unavailable. The efficacy of active sensing
approaches is often evaluated according to estimation error and information
gain metrics. However, these metrics do not directly explain the level of
cooperative behavior engendered by the active sensing algorithms. Next, we
extract different emergent cooperative behaviors that stem from the same
underlying algorithms but manifest differently under differing scenarios. In
particular, we highlight and demonstrate three emergent behavior patterns in
active sensing MRS: (i) Change of tracking responsibility between agents when
tracking trajectories with divergent directions or due to a re-allocation of
the resource among heterogeneous agents; (ii) Awareness of occlusions to a
trajectory and temporal leave-and-return of the sensing agent; (iii) Sharing of
local occlusion objects in MRS that subsequently improves the awareness of
occlusion.

structurally equivalent to so-called (1+1)D quantum cellular automata, which
are two-dimensional quantum lattice systems on which dynamics takes place in
discrete time. Information transfer between consecutive time slices -- or
adjacent network layers -- is governed by local quantum gates, which can be
regarded as the quantum counterpart of the classical perceptrons. Along the
time-direction an effective dissipative evolution emerges on the level of the
reduced state, and the nature of this dynamics is dictated by the structure of
the elementary gates. We show how to construct the local unitary gates to yield
a desired many-body dynamics, which in certain parameter regimes is governed by
a Lindblad master equation. We study this for small system sizes through
numerical simulations and demonstrate how collective effects within the quantum
cellular automaton can be controlled parametrically. Our study constitutes a
step towards the utilisation of large-scale emergent phenomena in large quantum

galaxy and the mass of its dark matter halo has been found observationally to
be nearly linear over five decades of mass. However, the high-mass end of this
relation is not well determined from previous data and shows large scatter. We
analyze the globular cluster systems (GCSs) of a homogeneous sample of 11
brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) through DOLPHOT photometry of their deep
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images in the F814W filter. We standardize the
definition of $M_{GCS}$, the total GCS mass, by using the GC total population
within a limiting radius of $0.1 R_{virial}$, while the dark-matter halo mass
$M_h$ is determined from the weak-lensing calibration of $M_h$ versus
$M_{bary}$. When these 11 BCGs are added to the previously studied homogeneous
catalogue of Virgo member galaxies, a total value for $\eta = M_{GCS}/M_h$ is
found to be $(3.0\pm1.8_{internal})\times10^{-5}$, slightly higher than
previous estimates but with much reduced uncertainty. Perhaps more importantly,
the results suggest that the relation continues to have a near-linear shape at
the highest galaxy masses, strongly reinforcing the conclusion that accreted
GCs make a major contribution to the GC populations at high galaxy mass.

Our ULX sample, having $\leq 2$% of contaminants, confirms that ULXs are

LightningSim, a fast simulation tool for HLS that combines the speed of native
C/C++ with the accuracy of C/RTL co-simulation. LightningSim directly operates
on the LLVM intermediate representation (IR) code and accurately simulates a
hardware design's dynamic behavior. First, it traces LLVM IR execution to
capture the run-time information; second, it maps the static HLS scheduling
information to the trace to simulate the dynamic behavior; third, it calculates
stalls and deadlocks from inter-function interactions to get precise cycle

modelled the 6.2/11.2 band ratio for circumcoronene and circumcircumcoronene

showed that in order to recreate Earth's mantle composition, it must grow first

increasingly oxidized (FeO rich) material. This accretion chemistry occurs when
an oxidation gradient exists across the disk so that the innermost solids are
reduced and increasingly oxidized material is found at greater heliocentric

model did not find an oxidation gradient that simultaneously reproduces the
mantle composition of Earth and Mars. Due to its small mass and rapid
formation, the formation history of Mars-like planets is very stochastic which
decreases the likelihood of compatibility with an Earth-producing oxidation
gradient in any given realization. To reconcile the accretion history and ideal
chemistry of the Mars-like planet with the oxidation gradient of an

network that can provide high-quality reconstructions from undersampled
parallel MRI data acquired with multiple sequences, acquisition settings and
field strengths.
  Methods: A single unrolled architecture, which offers good reconstructions
for multiple acquisition settings, is introduced. The proposed scheme adapts
the model to each setting by scaling the CNN features and the regularization
parameter with appropriate weights. The scaling weights and regularization
parameter are derived using a multi-layer perceptron model from conditional
vectors, which represents the specific acquisition setting. The perceptron
parameters and the CNN weights are jointly trained using data from multiple
acquisition settings, including differences in field strengths, acceleration,
and contrasts. The conditional network is validated using datasets acquired
with different acquisition settings.
  Results: The comparison of the adaptive framework, which trains a single
model using the data from all the settings, shows that it can offer
consistently improved performance for each acquisition condition. The
comparison of the proposed scheme with networks that are trained independently
for each acquisition setting shows that it requires less training data per
acquisition setting to offer good performance.
  Conclusion: The Ada-MoDL framework enables the use of a single model-based
unrolled network for multiple acquisition settings. In addition to eliminating
the need to train and store multiple networks for different acquisition
settings, this approach reduces the training data needed for each acquisition

emergence of a correlated Kondo liquid. Below $T_{\rm r} \! \sim \! 12$ K
linearity is gradually restored, indicating partial relocalization of the Kondo

in their optimisation. The literature proposes two traditional ways to solve
this integrated problem: hierarchical and monolithic. The monolithic approach
ignores the control level's objective and incorporates it as a constraint into
the upper level at the cost of suboptimality. The hierarchical approach
requires solving a mathematically complex bilevel problem with the scheduling
acting as the leader and control as the follower. The linking variables between
both levels belong to a small subset of scheduling and control decision
variables. For this subset of variables, data-driven surrogate models have been
used to learn follower responses to different leader decisions. In this work,
we propose to use ReLU neural networks for the control level. Consequently, the
bilevel problem is collapsed into a single-level MILP that is still able to
account for the control level's objective. This single-level MILP reformulation
is compared with the monolithic approach and benchmarked against embedding a
nonlinear expression of the neural networks into the optimisation. Moreover, a
neural network is used to predict control level feasibility. The case studies
involve batch reactor and sequential batch process scheduling problems. The
proposed methodology finds optimal solutions while largely outperforming both
approaches in terms of computational time. Additionally, due to well-developed
MILP solvers, adding ReLU neural networks in a MILP form marginally impacts the
computational time. The solution's error due to prediction accuracy is
correlated with the neural network training error. Overall, we expose how - by
using an existing big-M reformulation and being careful about integrating
machine learning and optimisation pipelines - we can more efficiently solve the

combinatorial optimization, with applications in transportation, communication,
logistics, and supply chain management, etc. Existing algorithms often focus on
low-accuracy approximate solutions, while high-accuracy algorithms typically
rely on general linear program solvers. In this paper, we present efficient
high-accuracy algorithms for a broad family of multicommodity flow problems on
undirected graphs, demonstrating improved running times compared to general
linear program solvers. Our main result shows that we can solve the $\ell_{q,
p}$-norm multicommodity flow problem to a $(1 + \varepsilon)$ approximation in
time $O_{q, p}(m^{1+o(1)} k^2 \log(1 / \varepsilon))$, where $k$ is the number
of commodities, and $O_{q, p}(\cdot)$ hides constants depending only on $q$ or
$p$. As $q$ and $p$ approach to $1$ and infinity respectively, $\ell_{q,
p}$-norm flow tends to maximum concurrent flow.
  We introduce the first iterative refinement framework for $\ell_{q, p}$-norm
minimization problems, which reduces the problem to solving a series of
decomposable residual problems. In the case of $k$-commodity flow, each
residual problem can be decomposed into $k$ single commodity convex flow
problems, each of which can be solved in almost-linear time. As many classical
variants of multicommodity flows were shown to be complete for linear programs
in the high-accuracy regime [Ding-Kyng-Zhang, ICALP'22], our result provides
new directions for studying more efficient high-accuracy multicommodity flow
algorithms.

processes and interactions of 20 informants (bank employees and farmers); (2)
design thinking workshops with teams from 3 banks, counting on 15-20

estimated trajectories of the surrounding objects. Multiple object tracking
refers to the process of estimating in real time these trajectories, leveraging
for this purpose sensors to detect the objects. This paper deals with devising
attacks on object tracking in automated vehicles. The vehicle is assumed to
have a detection-based object tracking system that relies on multiple sensors
and uses an estimator such as a Kalman filter for sensor fusion and state
estimation. The attack goal is to modify the object's state estimated by the
victim vehicle to put the vehicle in an unsafe situation. This goal is achieved
by judiciously perturbing some or all of the sensor outputs corresponding to
the object of interest over a desired horizon. A stochastic model predictive
control (SMPC) problem is formulated to compute the sequence of perturbations,
whereby hard constraints on the perturbations and probabilistic chance
constraints on the object's state are imposed. The chance constraints ensure
that some desired conditions for a successful attack are satisfied with a
prespecified probability. Reasonable assumptions are then made to obtain a
computationally tractable linear SMPC program. The approach is demonstrated on
an adaptive cruise control system in a simulation environment, where successful
sequential attacks are generated, leading the victim vehicle into dangerous
driving situations including collisions.

comprehensive ionized gas kinematic dataset, we aim to better constrain the
complex morphology and kinematics of the nuclear ionized gas. We use both
Narrow and Wide Field Mode integral field spectroscopic data from the Multi
Unit Spectroscopic Explorer instrument to model the kinematics of multiple
ionized gas emission lines. The dataset reveals complexities in the nuclear
ionized gas kinematics not seen in earlier observations. Several ionized gas
filaments, some with large flow velocities, can be traced down into the
projected sphere of influence. We also find evidence of a partially-filled
biconical outflow, aligned with the jet. The nuclear rotating ionized gas
'disk' is well resolved in our datacubes. The complexity of the nuclear
morphology precludes the measurement of an accurate black hole mass from the
ionized gas kinematics. The ionized gas kinematics can be explained with either
a 6.6 $\times 10^{9}\rm~M_{\odot}$ black hole with a disk inclination of
25\deg, or a 3.5 $\times 10^{9}\rm~M_{\odot}$ black hole with an inclination of
42\deg, with more support for the former. The velocity isophotes of the
sub-arcsecond ionized gas disk are twisted, and the position angle of the
innermost gas disk tends towards a value perpendicular to the radio jet axis.
An inclination close to 25\deg\ for the nuclear gas disk, and the warp in the
sub-arcsec ionized gas disk, help to reconcile the contradictory nature of key
earlier results: the discrepancy between stellar and ionized gas measurements,
and the mis-orientation between the axes of the ionized gas disk and the jet.

loci in chromatin using the classical Rouse model of polymer dynamics by the
agreement between the measured mean square displacement (MSD) versus time of

discovery of intermediate-scale chromatin organization, known as topologically
associating domains (TADs), together with the proposed explanation of TADs in
terms of chromatin loops and loop extrusion, is at odds with the classical
Rouse model, which does not contain loops. Accordingly, we introduce an
extended Rouse model that incorporates chromatin loop configurations from
loop-extrusion-factor-model simulations. Specifically, we extend the classical
Rouse model by modifying the polymer's dynamical matrix to incorporate extra
springs that represent loop bases. We also theoretically generalize the
friction coefficient matrix so that the Rouse beads with non-uniform friction
coefficients are compatible with our Rouse model simulation method. This
extended Rouse model allowes us to investigate the impact of loops and loop
extrusion on the dynamics of chromatin. We show that loops significantly
suppress the averaged MSD of a chromosomal locus, consistent with recent

stretching exponent values in this range have also been reported in recent
experiments [S. C. Weber, A. J. Spakowitz, and J. A. Theriot, Phys. Rev. Lett.

found to be located far from the Galactic plane and are thought to belong to
the Galactic halo, which is unexpected for this class of objects. Aims. Our
study investigates the halo membership of the proposed halo CP2 star candidates
based on their velocities and Galactic orbits, to determine their points of
origin. In addition, we searched for further halo CP2 star candidates using an
as-yet-unpublished sample of CP stars. Methods. Our analysis relied on the
astrometry from the early third \textit{Gaia} data release and radial
velocities based on the spectroscopy from LAMOST and SDSS, which was also
employed in spectral classification. The light variability of the confirmed CP2
stars in our sample was analyzed using data from the ZTF and ATLAS surveys.
Results. After filtering our initial sample using kinematic and spectroscopic
criteria, we identified six CP2 stars with kinematical properties consistent

  its impact on source current reconstruction",,,,,"physics.med-ph physics.app-ph physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a formulation where individual line segments of a current loop
have translationally non-invariant contributions to the electro-quasi-static
magnetic scalar potential and magnetic field in source-free regions. While
closed current loops composed of these open segments have translationally
invariant contributions, our formulation indicates that there are multiple ways
to decompose the magnetic field due to a closed current loop into the open
current segments. By defining the path-independent magnetic scalar potential
using a radial integration path with respect to a given origin, a formula has
been derived that shows that only non-radial line current segments have
non-zero contributions, whereas radial current segments are magnetically
silent. This indicates that magnetic forward models for open current segments
are non-unique, since the orientations of the currents are dependent on the
choice of the computational origin. This finding affects the conventional
physical interpretation of the significance of primary/volume currents in
biomagnetic forward and inverse models of brain activity, since their
contributions are shown to vary with the choice of origin in our formulation.
As an example, we perform a simple magnetoencephalography (MEG) equivalent
current dipole (ECD) fit for a spherical head model with various origin choices
to localize a primary current source. The primary current can be made to have
zero contributions in certain translated origin choices (and the volume
currents contribute to the signal entirely). Thus, there exist origins in which
the ECD model fits the data with high confidence but incorrect estimated
location of the primary current segment. In such cases, the dipole is fit to a
segment of the volume current. If one were unaware of any origin translations,
such ECD fits may be incorrectly interpreted as the primary current source.

an image. The key to deal with such problem is to mine the associations between
image contents and labels, and further obtain the correct assignments between
images and their labels. In this paper, we treat each image as a bag of
instances, and formulate the task of multi-label image recognition as an
instance-label matching selection problem. To model such problem, we propose an
innovative Semantic-aware Graph Matching framework for Multi-Label image
recognition (ML-SGM), in which Graph Matching mechanism is introduced owing to
its good performance of excavating the instance and label relationship. The
framework explicitly establishes category correlations and instance-label
correspondences by modeling the relation among content-aware (instance) and
semantic-aware (label) category representations, to facilitate multi-label
image understanding and reduce the dependency of large amounts of training
samples for each category. Specifically, we first construct an instance spatial
graph and a label semantic graph respectively and then incorporate them into a
constructed assignment graph by connecting each instance to all labels.
Subsequently, the graph network block is adopted to aggregate and update all
nodes and edges state on the assignment graph to form structured
representations for each instance and label. Our network finally derives a
prediction score for each instance-label correspondence and optimizes such
correspondence with a weighted cross-entropy loss. Empirical results conducted
on generic multi-label image recognition demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed method. Moreover, the proposed method also shows advantages in
multi-label recognition with partial labels and multi-label few-shot learning,
as well as outperforms current state-of-the-art methods with a clear margin.

framework for highly dynamic 5G radio access networks (RAN). Specifically,
first, we propose an attention-weighted group federated learning scheme. It
enables intelligent UEs to make TS decisions autonomously using local models
and observations, and a global model is defined to coordinate local TS
decisions and share experiences among UEs. Secondly, considering the individual
UE's limited computation and energy resources, a growing and pruning-based
model compression method is introduced, mitigating the computation burden of
UEs and reducing the communication overhead of federated learning. In addition,

throughput compared with cell-based TS and other UE-centric TS strategies,

by simultaneously reducing the number of spots and energy layers using the
reweighted $l_1$ regularization method. Approach: We formulated the proton
treatment planning problem as a convex optimization problem with a cost
function consisting of a dosimetric plan quality term plus a weighted $l_1$
regularization term. We iteratively solved this problem and adaptively updated
the regularization weights to promote the sparsity of both the spots and energy
layers. The proposed algorithm was tested on four head-and-neck patients, and
its performance, in terms of reducing the number of spots and energy layers,
was compared with existing standard $l_1$ and group $l_2$ regularization
methods. We also compared the effectiveness of the three methods ($l_1$, group
$l_2$, and reweighted $l_1$) at improving plan delivery efficiency without
compromising dosimetric plan quality by constructing each of their Pareto
surfaces charting the trade-off between plan delivery and plan quality. Main
results: The reweighted $l_1$ regularization method reduced the number of spots
and layers by an average of 40% and 35%, respectively, with an insignificant
cost to dosimetric plan quality. From the Pareto surfaces, it is clear that
reweighted $l_1$ provided a better trade-off between plan delivery efficiency
and dosimetric plan quality than standard $l_1$ or group $l_2$ regularization,
requiring the lowest cost to quality to achieve any given level of delivery
efficiency. Significance: Reweighted $l_1$ regularization is a powerful method
for simultaneously promoting the sparsity of spots and energy layers at a small
cost to dosimetric plan quality. This sparsity reduces the time required for
spot scanning and energy layer switching, thereby improving the delivery
efficiency of proton plans.

RSAV approach is unconditionally energy stable with respect to a modified
energy that is closer to the original free energy, and provides a much improved
accuracy when compared with the SAV approach. In this paper, inspired by the
RSAV approach, we propose a novel technique to correct the modified energy of
the SAV approach, which can be proved to be an optimal energy approximation. We
construct new high-order implicit-explicit schemes based on the proposed

excitation magnetic field is one of the most crucial factors that affects the
MPS signal of the MNPs. In this study, a multi-frequency MPS system is
developed to investigate the MPS signal of MNPs in different ac magnetic
fields. The MPS system consists of a multi-channel excitation module for the
generation of different-frequency ac magnetic fields and a detection module for
the measurement of the magnetic response of the MNPs. The MPS system allows to
generate ac magnetic fields with a frequency up to 32.6 kHz and amplitude up to
25 mT. The MPS signals of the MNPs in different ac magnetic fields are measured
to systematically evaluate the performance of the multi-frequency MPS system,
including the MNP spectra and its dynamic magnetization curve. In addition, the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the MPS system is quantitively assessed with
measured MPS signals of a given MNP sample and DI water. Furthermore, a series
of MNP samples with different iron concentrations are prepared and measured to
evaluate the limit-of-detection (LOD) in terms of iron concentration. The
influence of the excitation magnetic field, including frequency and amplitude,
is discussed based on the SNRs of the measured harmonics. Experimental results
show that the LOD is 2.3 ng in terms of iron.

stereoscopy, focusing on the estimation of disparities of human silhouettes.
Visible-thermal infrared stereo poses several challenges, including occlusions
and differently textured matching regions in both spectra. Finding matches
between two spectra with varying colors, textures, and shapes adds further
complexity to the task. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper
proposes a novel approach where a high-resolution convolutional neural network
is used to better capture relationships between the two spectra. To do so, a
modified HRNet backbone is used for feature extraction. This HRNet backbone is
capable of capturing fine details and textures as it extracts features at
multiple scales, thereby enabling the utilization of both local and global
information. For matching visible and thermal infrared regions, our method
extracts features on each patch using two modified HRNet streams. Features from
the two streams are then combined for predicting the disparities by
concatenation and correlation. Results on public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach by improving the results by
approximately 18 percentage points on the $\leq$ 1 pixel error, highlighting
its potential for improving accuracy in this task. The code of VisiTherS is

energy scaling as {\epsilon}^{2/3}{\ell}^{-1/3}k^{-2} where k is the

localized at a length scale in the spectral space. We show that the method of
generating shock waves or injection of wave energy in the system governs the
baroclinic interactions. For stochastically forced shock waves, baroclinic
termsare negligible. Broadband vorticity with energy at least two orders of
magnitude smaller is generated due to continuous variation in curvature of
shock waves caused by stochastic forcing. On the other hand, shock waves

found that most SADs show a roughly monotonous width decrease during their
descents, while some SADs with small initial widths can have complex
evolutions. 3D reconstruction results based on SDO and Solar Terrestrial
Relations Observatory Ahead (STEREO-A) images and thermal properties analysis
reveal that differences in magnetic and plasma environments may result in that
SADs in the north are overall wider than those in the south. Additionally,
correlation analysis between the width and other parameters of SADs was further
conducted and revealed that: (1) SADs with different initial widths show no

depth of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in scattering samples. We propose a
method termed multi-focus averaging (MFA) to suppress the multiple-scattering
signals and improve the image contrast of OCT in deep regions. The MFA method
captures multiple OCT volumes with various focal positions and averages them in
complex form after correcting the varying defocus through computational
refocusing. Because the multiple-scattering takes different trajectories among
the different focal position configurations, this averaging suppresses the
multiple-scattering signal. Meanwhile, the single-scattering takes a consistent
trajectory regardless of the focal position configuration and is not
suppressed. Hence, the MFA method improves the signal ratio between the single-

superconductivity does not appear in this parent compound based on a sensitive

thus, major emphasis is placed on understanding and modeling them, taking

the small scale dynamics of turbulence, via the velocity gradient tensor. The
model is based on obtaining functional closures for the pressure Hessian and
viscous Laplacian contributions as functions of velocity gradient tensor. This
task is accomplished using deep neural networks that are consistent with
physical constraints and incorporate Reynolds number dependence explicitly to
account for small-scale intermittency. We then utilize a massive direct
numerical simulation database, spanning two orders of magnitude in the
large-scale Reynolds number, for training and validation. The model learns from

in the weighted unmixing framework, the central pixel abundance is dynamically
weighted by the coarse-grained abundances of surrounding pixels. In addition,
SAWU-Net generates dynamically adaptive spatial weights through the spatial
attention mechanism, so as to dynamically integrate surrounding pixels more
effectively. Experimental results on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate
the better accuracy and superiority of SAWU-Net, which reflects the

generalization is that the model trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM)
learns spurious features instead of the desired invariant features. However,
several recent studies challenged this explanation and found that deep networks
may have already learned sufficiently good features for OOD generalization. The
debate extends to the in-distribution and OOD performance correlations along
with training or fine-tuning neural nets across a variety of OOD generalization
tasks. To understand these seemingly contradicting phenomena, we conduct a
theoretical investigation and find that ERM essentially learns both spurious
features and invariant features. On the other hand, the quality of learned
features during ERM pre-training significantly affects the final OOD
performance, as OOD objectives rarely learn new features. Failing to capture
all the underlying useful features during pre-training will further limit the
final OOD performance. To remedy the issue, we propose Feature Augmented
Training (FAT ), to enforce the model to learn all useful features by retaining
the already learned features and augmenting new ones by multiple rounds. In
each round, the retention and augmentation operations are performed on
different subsets of the training data that capture distinct features.
Extensive experiments show that FAT effectively learns richer features and
consistently improves the OOD performance when applied to various objectives.

strong privacy regulations as, e.g., encountered in health care. Differential
privacy is the well-known state-of-the-art framework for guaranteeing

to select the sense whose contextualized embeddings computed for its definition

This approach relies on the similarity of the \textit{sense} and
\textit{context} embeddings computed by a pre-trained language model. We
propose a semantic specialization for WSD where contextualized embeddings are
adapted to the WSD task using solely lexical knowledge. The key idea is, for a
given sense, to bring semantically related senses and contexts closer and send
different/unrelated senses farther away. We realize this idea as the joint
optimization of the Attract-Repel objective for sense pairs and the
self-training objective for context-sense pairs while controlling deviations
from the original embeddings. The proposed method outperformed previous studies
that adapt contextualized embeddings. It achieved state-of-the-art performance
on knowledge-based WSD when combined with the reranking heuristic that uses the

(HARQ) is recognized as an effective technique to ensure reliable THz
communications. This paper delves into the performance analysis of HARQ with
incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR)-aided THz communications in the
presence/absence of blockage. More specifically, the analytical expression of
the outage probability of HARQ-IR-aided THz communications is derived, with
which the asymptotic outage analysis is enabled to gain meaningful insights,
including diversity order, power allocation gain, modulation and coding gain,
etc. Then the long term average throughput (LTAT) is expressed in terms of the
outage probability based on renewal theory. Moreover, to combat the blockage
effects, a multi-hop HARQ-IR-aided THz communication scheme is proposed and its
performance is examined. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme,
the other two HARQ-aided schemes, i.e., Type-I HARQ and HARQ with chase
combining (HARQ-CC), are used for benchmarking in the simulations. In addition,
a deep neural network (DNN) based outage evaluation framework with low
computational complexity is devised to reap the benefits of using both
asymptotic and simulation results in low and high outage regimes, respectively.
This novel outage evaluation framework is finally employed for the optimal rate
selection, which outperforms the asymptotic based optimization.

challenges: (i) the 3D representations are complex and in general contains much
more information than 2D image; (ii) many 3D representations are not well
suited for gradient-based optimization, let alone disentanglement. To address
these challenges, we use NeRF as a differentiable 3D representation, and
introduce a self-supervised Navigation to identify interpretable semantic
directions in the latent space. To our best knowledge, this novel method,
dubbed NaviNeRF, is the first work to achieve fine-grained 3D disentanglement
without any priors or supervisions. Specifically, NaviNeRF is built upon the
generative NeRF pipeline, and equipped with an Outer Navigation Branch and an
Inner Refinement Branch. They are complementary -- the outer navigation is to
identify global-view semantic directions, and the inner refinement dedicates to
fine-grained attributes. A synergistic loss is further devised to coordinate
two branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NaviNeRF has a superior
fine-grained 3D disentanglement ability than the previous 3D-aware models. Its
performance is also comparable to editing-oriented models relying on semantic

engineering due to its high efficiency. Field inversion and machine learning
(FIML) techniques have improved RANS models' predictive capabilities for
separated flows. However, FIML-generated models often lack interpretability,
limiting physical understanding and manual improvements based on prior
knowledge. Additionally, these models may struggle with generalization in flow
fields distinct from the training set. This study addresses these issues by
employing symbolic regression (SR) to derive an analytical relationship between
the correction factor of the baseline turbulence model and local flow
variables, enhancing the baseline model's ability to predict separated flow
across diverse test cases. The shear-stress-transport (SST) model undergoes
field inversion on a curved backward-facing step (CBFS) case to obtain the
corrective factor field beta, and SR is used to derive a symbolic map between
local flow features and beata. The SR-derived analytical function is integrated
into the original SST model, resulting in the SST-SR model. The SST-SR model's
generalization capabilities are demonstrated by its successful predictions of
separated flow on various test cases, including 2D-bump cases with varying
heights, periodic hill case where separation is dominated by geometric
features, and the three-dimensional Ahmed-body case. In these tests, the model
accurately predicts flow fields, showing its effectiveness in cases completely
different from the training set. The Ahmed-body case, in particular, highlights
the model's ability to predict the three-dimensional massively separated flows.
When applied to a turbulent boundary layer with Re_L=1.0E7, the SST-SR model
predicts wall friction coefficient and log layer comparably to the original SST
model, maintaining the attached boundary layer prediction performance.

2022. Kaonic carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and aluminium transitions, which occur in
the setup materials, were measured by using the kaons stopped in the gaseous
helium target cell with aluminium frames and Kapton walls, and are reported in
this paper. These new kaonic atoms measurements add valuable input to the
kaonic atoms transitions data base, which is used as a reference for theories
and models of the low-energy strong interaction between antikaon and nuclei.
Moreover, these results pave the way for future dedicated kaonic atoms
measurements through the whole periodic table and to a new era for the
antikaon-nuclei studies at low energy.

adding specific noise to the input samples, bringing potential threats to
security and robustness when applied to facial recognition systems. Although
existing defense techniques achieve high accuracy in detecting some specific
adversarial faces (adv-faces), new attack methods especially GAN-based attacks
with completely different noise patterns circumvent them and reach a higher
attack success rate. Even worse, existing techniques require attack data before
implementing the defense, making it impractical to defend newly emerging
attacks that are unseen to defenders. In this paper, we investigate the
intrinsic generality of adv-faces and propose to generate pseudo adv-faces by
perturbing real faces with three heuristically designed noise patterns. We are
the first to train an adv-face detector using only real faces and their
self-perturbations, agnostic to victim facial recognition systems, and agnostic
to unseen attacks. By regarding adv-faces as out-of-distribution data, we then
naturally introduce a novel cascaded system for adv-face detection, which
consists of training data self-perturbations, decision boundary regularization,
and a max-pooling-based binary classifier focusing on abnormal local color
aberrations. Experiments conducted on LFW and CelebA-HQ datasets with eight
gradient-based and two GAN-based attacks validate that our method generalizes
to a variety of unseen adversarial attacks.

they can affect the transfer of energy and leave traces in observational
signatures. In this work, we develop two-dimensional supernova models including
the effects of the production and the absorption of ALPs that couple with
photons. It is found that the additional heating induced by ALPs can enhance
the explosion energy E_exp; for moderate ALP-photon coupling, we find explosion
energies ~0.6*10^51 erg compared to our reference model without ALPs of
~0.4*10^51 erg. Our findings also indicate that when the coupling constant is
sufficiently high, the neutrino luminosities and mean energies are decreased
because of the additional cooling of the proto-neutron star. The gravitational
wave strain is also reduced because the mass accretion on the proto-neutron
star is suppressed. Although the ALP-photon coupling can foster explodability,
including enhancing the explosion energy closer to recent observations, more
long-term simulations in spatially three-dimension are needed to draw robust
conclusions.

exploited to discriminate them from two uncorrelated gamma photons contributing
to the background. Recent experimental studies of polarization correlations of

results indicate that the correlation, expressed in terms of the polarimetric

a jet from a large amplitude, axisymmetric surface deformation imposed on a
quiescent, deep pool of liquid. Mechanistically, the jet owes it origin to the
focussing of a concentric, surface wave towards the axis of symmetry, quite
analogous to such focussing of capillary waves and resultant jet formation,
observed during bubble collapse at small scales. A weakly non linear theory
based on the method of multiple scales and the potential flow limit, is
presented for a modal (single mode) initial condition representing the solution
to the primary Cauchy Poisson problem. A pair of novel, coupled, amplitude
equations are derived governing the modulation of the primary mode. For
moderate values of the perturbation parameter epsilon (a measure of the initial
perturbation amplitude), our second order theory captures the overshoot
(incipient jet) at the axis of symmetry quite well, demonstrating good
agreement with numerical simulation of the incompressible, Euler's equation
with gravity (Popinet 2014) and no surface tension. Expectedly, our theory
becomes inaccurate as epsilon approaches unity. In this strongly nonlinear
regime, slender jets form with surface accelerations exceeding gravity by three
orders of magnitude. In this inertial regime, the jets observed in our
simulations show excellent agreement with the inertial, self-similar,
analytical solution by Longuet-Higgins (1983). The physical mechanism of
axisymmetric jet formation is explained based on mass conservation arguments.
We demonstrate that the underlying wave focussing mechanism, may be understood
in terms of radially inward motion of nodal points of a linearised,
axisymmetric, standing wave.

plays a core role in the intelligent legal system. Despite the success that
pre-training has achieved in ad-hoc retrieval tasks, effective pre-training
strategies for legal case retrieval remain to be explored. Compared with
general documents, legal case documents are typically long text sequences with
intrinsic logical structures. However, most existing language models have
difficulty understanding the long-distance dependencies between different
structures. Moreover, in contrast to the general retrieval, the relevance in
the legal domain is sensitive to key legal elements. Even subtle differences in
key legal elements can significantly affect the judgement of relevance.
However, existing pre-trained language models designed for general purposes
have not been equipped to handle legal elements.
  To address these issues, in this paper, we propose SAILER, a new
Structure-Aware pre-traIned language model for LEgal case Retrieval. It is
highlighted in the following three aspects: (1) SAILER fully utilizes the
structural information contained in legal case documents and pays more
attention to key legal elements, similar to how legal experts browse legal case
documents. (2) SAILER employs an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture to
integrate several different pre-training objectives. In this way, rich semantic
information across tasks is encoded into dense vectors. (3) SAILER has powerful
discriminative ability, even without any legal annotation data. It can
distinguish legal cases with different charges accurately. Extensive
experiments over publicly available legal benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach can significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods in
legal case retrieval.

nonlinear photonic crystal. Because the photonic crystal reduces the group
velocity of the incident light, if it is composed of a material with a
second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$, the interaction
between the nonlinear material and the light passing through it strengthens and
the quantum state of the emitted light is largely squeezed. Thus, we can
generate a squeezed coherent light with a resonating cavity in which the
nonlinear photonic crystal is placed. This squeezed coherent state is defined
with the Lie-Trotter product formula and its mathematical expression is
different from those of conventional squeezed coherent states. We show that we
can obtain this squeezed coherent state with a squeezing level $15.9$ dB
practically by adjusting physical parameters for our proposed method. Feeding
the squeezed light whose average number of photons is given by one or two into
a beam splitter and splitting the flow of the squeezed light into a pair of
entangled light beams, we estimate their entanglement quantitatively. This

challenges, including the trade-off among accuracy loss, carbon emission, and
unknown future costs. Besides, many governments are launching carbon emission
rights (CER) for operators to reduce carbon emissions further to reverse
climate change. Facing these challenges, to achieve carbon-aware ML task
offloading under limited carbon emission rights thus to achieve green edge AI,
we establish a joint ML task offloading and CER purchasing problem, intending
to minimize the accuracy loss under the long-term time-averaged cost budget of
purchasing the required CER. However, considering the uncertainty of the
resource prices, the CER purchasing prices, the carbon intensity of sites, and
ML tasks' arrivals, it is hard to decide the optimal policy online over a
long-running period time. To overcome this difficulty, we leverage the
two-timescale Lyapunov optimization technique, of which the $T$-slot
drift-plus-penalty methodology inspires us to propose an online algorithm that
purchases CER in multiple timescales (on-preserved in carbon future market and
on-demanded in the carbon spot market) and makes decisions about where to
offload ML tasks. Considering the NP-hardness of the $T$-slot problems, we
further propose the resource-restricted randomized dependent rounding algorithm
to help to gain the near-optimal solution with no help of any future
information. Our theoretical analysis and extensive simulation results driven
by the real carbon intensity trace show the superior performance of the
proposed algorithms.

However, the vanilla LiDAR-based BEV feature often contains many indefinite

this paper, we propose an effective LiDAR-based method to build semantic map.
Specifically, we introduce a BEV feature pyramid decoder that learns the robust

the accuracy of the LiDAR-based method. To mitigate the defects caused by
lacking semantic cues in LiDAR data, we present an online Camera-to-LiDAR

distillation to absorb the semantic information from camera in BEV. The

a continuum of solutions of equations of motion for massless particles

the space-time structure itself is changed by the appearance of a new
fundamental constant $c$ with the dimension of a velocity. This maximum
velocity $c$, derived here for massless particles, is analogous to the accuracy
limit $\hbar$ derived earlier for massive particles. The projection method can
thus be interpreted as a generalized quantization. We suspect that all

trajectories, and that in this sense the particle concept is more fundamental
than the field concept.

Despite being studied for a long time, a bottleneck for existing approaches is
that given a code snippet, they can only generate one comment while developers
usually need to know information from diverse perspectives such as what is the
functionality of this code snippet and how to use it. To tackle this
limitation, this study empirically investigates the feasibility of utilizing
large language models (LLMs) to generate comments that can fulfill developers'
diverse intents. Our intuition is based on the facts that (1) the code and its
pairwise comment are used during the pre-training process of LLMs to build the
semantic connection between the natural language and programming language, and
(2) comments in the real-world projects, which are collected for the
pre-training, usually contain different developers' intents. We thus postulate
that the LLMs can already understand the code from different perspectives after
the pre-training. Indeed, experiments on two large-scale datasets demonstrate
the rationale of our insights: by adopting the in-context learning paradigm and
giving adequate prompts to the LLM (e.g., providing it with ten or more
examples), the LLM can significantly outperform a state-of-the-art supervised
learning approach on generating comments with multiple intents. Results also
show that customized strategies for constructing the prompts and
post-processing strategies for reranking the results can both boost the LLM's

because certain structures must be presented in reduced dynamics, rather than
in original dynamics (as original dynamics is a mixture of original dynamics).
Reduced dynamics is a computation sequence from starting integer to the first
integer less than it, in terms of ``I'' that represents (3*x+1)/2 and ``O''
that represents x/2. We formally prove that all positive integers are
partitioned into two halves and either presents ``I'' or ``O'' in next ongoing
computation. More specifically, (1) if any positive integer x that is i module
$2^t$ (i is an odd integer) is given, then the first t computations (each one
is either ``I'' or ``O'' corresponding to whether current integer is odd or
even) will be identical with that of i. (2) If current integer after t
computations (in terms of ``I'' or ``O'') is less than x, then reduced dynamics
of x is available. Otherwise, the residue class of x (namely, i module $2^t$)
can be partitioned into two halves (namely, i module $2^{t+1}$ and $i+2^t$

evaluating surprisal estimates from Transformer-based language model variants
that vary systematically in the amount of training data and model capacity on
their ability to predict human reading times. The results show that surprisal
estimates from most variants with contemporary model capacities provide the
best fit after seeing about two billion training tokens, after which they begin
to diverge from humanlike expectations. Additionally, newly-trained smaller
model variants reveal a 'tipping point' at convergence, after which the
decrease in language model perplexity begins to result in poorer fits to human

achieves a high variable-aware log abstraction accuracy that further identifies

autonomous driving scene understanding. However, it is difficult for existing
models to achieve both high inference speed and accuracy simultaneously. For
example, voxel-based methods perform well in accuracy, while Bird's-Eye-View
(BEV)-based methods can achieve real-time inference. To overcome this issue, we
develop an effective 3D-to-BEV knowledge distillation method that transfers
rich knowledge from 3D voxel-based models to BEV-based models. Our framework
mainly consists of two modules: the voxel-to-pillar distillation module and the
label-weight distillation module. Voxel-to-pillar distillation distills sparse
3D features to BEV features for middle layers to make the BEV-based model aware
of more structural and geometric information. Label-weight distillation helps
the model pay more attention to regions with more height information. Finally,
we conduct experiments on the SemanticKITTI dataset and Paris-Lille-3D. The
results on SemanticKITTI show more than 5% improvement on the test set,
especially for classes such as motorcycle and person, with more than 15%
improvement. The code can be accessed at

At the same time, it is widely recognized that vehicles such as autonomous

vehicles empowered with SCCSI capability form a web of mobile servers and

syntactically related words close in a sentence, is thought to universally
shape the structure of human languages for effective communication. However,
the extent to which dependency length minimization is applied in human language
systems is not yet fully understood. Preverbally, the placement of
long-before-short constituents and postverbally, short-before-long constituents
are known to minimize overall dependency length of a sentence. In this study,
we test the hypothesis that placing only the shortest preverbal constituent
next to the main-verb explains word order preferences in Hindi (a SOV language)
as opposed to the global minimization of dependency length. We characterize
this approach as a least-effort strategy because it is a cost-effective way to
shorten all dependencies between the verb and its preverbal dependencies. As
such, this approach is consistent with the bounded-rationality perspective
according to which decision making is governed by ""fast but frugal"" heuristics
rather than by a search for optimal solutions. Consistent with this idea, our
results indicate that actual corpus sentences in the Hindi-Urdu Treebank corpus
are better explained by the least effort strategy than by global minimization
of dependency lengths. Additionally, for the task of distinguishing corpus
sentences from counterfactual variants, we find that the dependency length and
constituent length of the constituent closest to the main verb are much better
predictors of whether a sentence appeared in the corpus than total dependency
length. Overall, our findings suggest that cognitive resource constraints play
a crucial role in shaping natural languages.

paper, we systematically analyze these drawbacks in terms of training
efficiency in the parallel framework view and propose a novel MoE architecture

incorporating with tensor parallel and replaces communication-intensive
all-to-all dispatching and gathering with a simple tensor index slicing and
inner-node all-reduce. Besides, it is convenient for PPMoE to integrate
pipeline parallel to further scale the backbone due to its flexible parallel
architecture. Extensive experiments show that PPMoE not only achieves a more
than $1.75\times$ speed up compared to existing MoE architectures but also
reaches $90\%$ throughput of its corresponding backbone model that is
$20\times$ smaller.

balances the molecular-scale forces that drive demixing with large-scale

Comments welcome",,,,"physics.soc-ph cond-mat.dis-nn cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Moves in chess games are usually analyzed on a case-by-case basis by
professional players, but thanks to the availability of large game databases,
we can envision another approach of the game. Here, we indeed adopt a very
different point of view, and analyze moves in chess games from a statistical
point of view. We first focus on spatial properties and the location of pieces
and show that the number of possible moves during a game is positively
correlated with its outcome. We then study heatmaps of pieces and show that the
spatial distribution of pieces varies less between human players than with
engines (such as Stockfish): engines seem to use pieces in a very different way
as human did for centuries. These heatmaps also allow us to construct a
distance between players that characterizes how they use their pieces. In a
second part, we focus on the best move and the second best move found by
Stockfish and study the difference $\Delta$ of their evaluation. We found
different regimes during a chess game. In a `quiet' regime, $\Delta$ is small,
indicating that many paths are possible for both players. In contrast, there
are also `volatile' regimes characterized by a `tipping point', for which
$\Delta$ becomes large. At these tipping points, the outcome could then switch
completely depending on the move chosen. We also found that for a large number
of games, the distribution of $\Delta$ can be fitted by a power law
$P(\Delta)\sim \Delta^{-\beta}$ with an exponent that seems to be universal
(for human players and engines) and around $\beta\approx 1.8$. The probability
to encounter a tipping point in a game is therefore far from being negligible.
Finally, we conclude by mentioning possible directions of research for a
quantitative understanding of chess games such as the structure of the pawn
chain, the interaction graph between pieces, or a quantitative definition of
critical points.

security for edges and IoT devices, making VFL an essential component of
Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) systems. Nevertheless, the partitioned
structure of VFL can be exploited by adversaries to inject a backdoor, enabling
them to manipulate the VFL predictions. In this paper, we aim to investigate
the vulnerability of VFL in the context of binary classification tasks. To this
end, we define a threat model for backdoor attacks in VFL and introduce a
universal adversarial backdoor (UAB) attack to poison the predictions of VFL.
The UAB attack, consisting of universal trigger generation and clean-label
backdoor injection, is incorporated during the VFL training at specific
iterations. This is achieved by alternately optimizing the universal trigger
and model parameters of VFL sub-problems. Our work distinguishes itself from
existing studies on designing backdoor attacks for VFL, as those require the
knowledge of auxiliary information not accessible within the split VFL
architecture. In contrast, our approach does not necessitate any additional
data to execute the attack. On the LendingClub and Zhongyuan datasets, our
approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 100\%
backdoor task performance while maintaining the main task performance. Our
results in this paper make a major advance to revealing the hidden backdoor

learning paradigm, where only output logits of public datasets are transmitted
as distilled knowledge, instead of passing on private model parameters that are
susceptible to gradient inversion attacks, a known privacy risk in federated
learning. In this paper, we found that even though sharing output logits of
public datasets is safer than directly sharing gradients, there still exists a
substantial risk of data exposure caused by carefully designed malicious
attacks. Our study shows that a malicious server can inject a PLI
(Paired-Logits Inversion) attack against FedMD and its variants by training an
inversion neural network that exploits the confidence gap between the server
and client models. Experiments on multiple facial recognition datasets validate
that under FedMD-like schemes, by using paired server-client logits of public
datasets only, the malicious server is able to reconstruct private images on
all tested benchmarks with a high success rate.

theory of nature. Longstanding concerns regarding its mathematical foundations
and physical interpretation persist, a full century beyond its conception.
Limited by these issues, efforts to move beyond QM have struggled to gain
traction within the broader physics community. One approach to progress in this
direction, which is deeply rooted in the tradition of physics, is the
development of new models for physical systems otherwise treated by QM. One
such model is presented here, which concerns the interaction of a spin system
with sequences of two Stern-Gerlach detectors that may be independently
rotated. Rather than employing the traditional formalism of QM, the proposed
model is supported by tools from discrete mathematics, such as finite groups,
set theory, and combinatorics. Equipped with this novel toolkit, an analog of
Wigner's d-matrix formula is derived and shown to deviate slightly from QM.
With these results, the proposed model is extended to an optical system
involving photon number states passing through a beam splitter. Leveraging
recent advancements in high precision experiments on these systems, we then
propose a means of testing the new model using a tabletop experiment. Hence,
the proposed model not only makes clear testable predictions, but also provides
valuable insight into the essential principles of quantum theory.

the most relevant image given the dialogue history and a database of images.
The response generator, implemented by ViT and GPT-2/DialoGPT, generates an
appropriate response given the dialogue history and the most recently retrieved

successful apps and less successful apps. I measure the success here using
cumulative installs and the firms that developed the apps. Based on third-party
rankings and the shape of the distribution of installs, I set two thresholds
and divided apps into market-leading and market-follower apps. The
market-leading sub-sample consists of apps with high cumulative installs or
developed by prestigious firms, and the market-follower sub-sample consists of
the rest of the apps. I found that the impact of being niche is smaller in the
market-leading apps because of their relatively higher heterogeneity. In
addition, being niche also impact utility apps differently from hedonic apps or
apps with two-sided market characteristics. For the special gaming category,
being niche has some effect but is smaller than in the market follower
sub-sample. My research provides novel empirical evidence of digital products

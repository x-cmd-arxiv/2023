  Bitemporal Change Detection Using Modern Hopfield Networks",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Change detection, as an important application for high-resolution remote
sensing images, aims to monitor and analyze changes in the land surface over
time. With the rapid growth in the quantity of high-resolution remote sensing
data and the complexity of texture features, a number of quantitative deep
learning-based methods have been proposed. Although these methods outperform
traditional change detection methods by extracting deep features and combining
spatial-temporal information, reasonable explanations about how deep features
work on improving the detection performance are still lacking. In our
investigations, we find that modern Hopfield network layers achieve
considerable performance in semantic understandings. In this paper, we propose
a Deep Supervision and FEature Retrieval network (Dsfer-Net) for bitemporal
change detection. Specifically, the highly representative deep features of
bitemporal images are jointly extracted through a fully convolutional Siamese
network. Based on the sequential geo-information of the bitemporal images, we
then design a feature retrieval module to retrieve the difference feature and
leverage discriminative information in a deeply supervised manner. We also note
that the deeply supervised feature retrieval module gives explainable proofs
about the semantic understandings of the proposed network in its deep layers.
Finally, this end-to-end network achieves a novel framework by aggregating the
retrieved features and feature pairs from different layers. Experiments
conducted on three public datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and CDD) confirm the
superiority of the proposed Dsfer-Net over other state-of-the-art methods. Code
will be available online (https://github.com/ShizhenChang/Dsfer-Net).

Program Repair (APR), in particular towards deep neural networks. This entails
training on hundreds of thousands or even millions of non-executable code

neglected in Neural Program Repair (NPR), namely its execution. Code execution
has several significant advantages. It allows for test-based evaluation of
candidate fixes and can provide valuable information to aid repair. In this
work we present a fully executable dataset of 450,000 small buggy/fixed program
pairs originally submitted to programming competition websites written in eight
different programming languages. Along with the dataset we provide
infrastructure to compile, safely execute and test programs as well as
fine-grained bug-type labels. To give a point of reference, we provide basic
evaluation results for two baselines, one based on a generate-and-validate
approach and one on deep learning. With this dataset we follow several goals:
we want to lift Neural Program Repair beyond fully static code representations,
foster the use of execution-based features and, by including several different
languages, counterbalance the predominance of Java in the current landscape of
APR datasets and benchmarks.

components of the dielectric loss. The inverse of the internal quality factor
is a second measure of the overall loss of the resonator, where TLS loss

technique is a differential optical measurement at 150 GHz. The same antenna
feeds two microstrip lines with different lengths that terminate in two
microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs). The difference in the detector
response is used to estimate the loss per unit length of the microstrip line.
Our results suggest a larger loss for SiN$_x$ at 150 GHz of ${\mathrm{\tan

${\mathrm{\gtrsim 1\times10^{-3}}}$ measured at $\sim$1 GHz using the other two

adjusting the microstrip lengths to provide enough optical efficiency contrast

symbol-level statistics, with the information source modeled as a long sequence
of i.i.d. random variables or a stochastic process, thus establishing the
fundamental limit as entropy for lossless compression and as mutual information
for lossy compression. However, the source (including text, music, and speech)
in the real world is often statistically ill-defined because of its close
connection to human perception, and thus the model-driven approach can be quite
suboptimal. This study places careful emphasis on English text and exploits its
semantic aspect to enhance the compression efficiency further. The main idea
stems from the puzzle crossword, observing that the hidden words can still be
precisely reconstructed so long as some key letters are provided. The proposed
masking-based strategy resembles the above game. In a nutshell, the encoder
evaluates the semantic importance of each word according to the semantic loss
and then masks the minor ones, while the decoder aims to recover the masked
words from the semantic context by means of the Transformer. Our experiments
show that the proposed semantic approach can achieve much higher compression
efficiency than the traditional methods such as Huffman code and UTF-8 code,
while preserving the meaning in the target text to a great extent.

blockchain-based process enactment: from on-chain smart contracts to state

conducting most transactions off-chain while mostly retaining the core security

model-driven approach to enacting processes on state channels, with the aim to
retain the desired blockchain properties while reducing the on-chain footprint
as much as possible. We here focus on the principled approach of state channels
as a platform, to enable manifold future optimizations in various directions,
like latency and confidentiality. We implement our approach prototypical and
evaluate it both qualitatively (w.r.t. assumptions and guarantees) and
quantitatively (w.r.t. correctness and gas cost). In short, while the initial
deployment effort is higher with state channels, it typically pays off after a
few process instances; and as long as the new assumptions hold, so do the
guarantees.

the prior work of training a specialized open-set classifier or weighted

the zero-shot recognition capabilities. However, rejecting target-private

satisfactorily reject the target-private instances, thereby facilitating better
alignment between the shared classes of the two domains. The code is available.

the training on image-sentence pairs. Due to the lack of dense annotations,
existing text-supervised methods can only learn to group an image into semantic
regions via pixel-insensitive feedback. As a result, their grouped results are
coarse and often contain small spurious regions, limiting the upper-bound
performance of segmentation. On the other hand, we observe that grouped results
from self-supervised models are more semantically consistent and break the
bottleneck of existing methods. Motivated by this, we introduce associate
self-supervised spatially-consistent grouping with text-supervised semantic
segmentation. Considering the part-like grouped results, we further adapt a
text-supervised model from image-level to region-level recognition with two
core designs. First, we encourage fine-grained alignment with a one-way
noun-to-region contrastive loss, which reduces the mismatched noun-region
pairs. Second, we adopt a contextually aware masking strategy to enable
simultaneous recognition of all grouped regions. Coupled with
spatially-consistent grouping and region-adapted recognition, our method
achieves 59.2% mIoU and 32.4% mIoU on Pascal VOC and Pascal Context benchmarks,

Spin(7) structure is integrable if and only if Phi is closed. We introduce the
notion of a complex Cayley form. This is a one-parameter family of complex
4-forms Phi_tau on M of a special algebraic type. Each Phi_tau determines a
real Riemannian metric on M, as well as a complex unit Weyl spinor psi_tau. The
subgroup of GL(8,R) that stabilises Phi_tau, tau not=0 is SU(4), and Phi_tau
defines on $M$ an SU(4) structure. We show that this SU(4) structure is
integrable if and only if Phi_tau is closed.
  We carry out a similar construction for the split signature case. There are
now two one-parameter families of complex Cayley forms. A complex Cayley form
of one type defines an SU(2,2) structure, a form of the other type defines an
SL(4,R) structure on M. As in the Riemannian case, these structures are
integrable if and only of the corresponding complex Cayley forms are closed.
Our central observation is that there exists a special member of the second
one-parameter family of complex Cayley forms, which we call the Lorentzian
Cayley form. This 4-form has the property that it is calibrated by Lorentzian
4-dimensional subspaces H,H^perp. In particular, in a basis adapted to such a
calibration, the Lorentzian Cayley form is built from the complex self-dual
2-forms for H,H^perp. We explain how these observations solve a certain puzzle

increase in the failure probability by a factor of $T$, where $T$ is the number

moment generating function of a well chosen supermartingale sequence. We
improve the dependency on $T$ in the convergence guarantee for a wide range of
algorithms with clipped gradients, including stochastic (accelerated) mirror
descent for convex objectives and stochastic gradient descent for nonconvex
objectives. This approach naturally allows the algorithms to use time-varying
step sizes and clipping parameters when the time horizon is unknown, which
appears impossible in prior works. We show that in the case of clipped

exciting route to study exotic phases arising due to interplay between
electronic correlations and topology. Besides superconductivity, these
materials exhibit a charge-density wave (CDW) phase occurring at around 100 K,
whose origin still remains elusive. The robust multi-component $2 \times 2$ CDW
phase in these systems is of great interest due to the presence of an unusually
large anomalous Hall effect. In quasi-2D systems with weak inter-layer coupling
fluctuation driven exotic phases may appear. In particular in systems with
multi-component order parameters fluctuations may lead to establishment of
composite order when only products of individual order parameters condense
while the individual ones themselves remain disordered. We argue that such
fluctuation-driven regime of composite CDW order may exist in thin films of
kagome metals above the CDW transition temperature. We also find that the
transition from the composite to individual CDW order is in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$
Potts universality class. Our findings suggest possible presence of exotic
phases in the weakly coupled layered kagome metals, more so in the newly
synthesized thin films of kagome metals.

The first model is a deterministic and reversible automaton describing two
species of quasiparticles: stable massless matter particles moving with
velocity $\pm 1$ and unstable, standing (zero velocity) field particles. We
discuss two distinct continuity equations for three conserved charges of the
model. While the first two charges and the corresponding currents have support
three (3) lattice sites and represent a lattice analogue of conserved
energy-momentum tensor, we find an additional conserved charge and current with
support of nine (9) sites, implying non-ergodic behaviour and potentially
signalling integrability of the model with a highly nested R-matrix structure.
The second model represents a quantum (or stochastic) deformation of a recently
introduced and studied charged hardpoint lattice gas, where particles of
different binary charge ($\pm 1$) and binary velocity ($\pm 1$) can
nontrivially mix upon elastic collisional scattering. We show that while the
unitary evolution rule of this model does not satisfy the full Yang-Baxter
equation, it still satisfies an intriguing related identity which gives birth
to an infinite set of local conserved operators, the-so-called glider

long-tail recognition, by sampling subsets from two datasets: SSv2 and VideoLT.
  We then propose a method, Long-Tail Mixed Reconstruction, which reduces
overfitting to instances from few-shot classes by reconstructing them as
weighted combinations of samples from head classes. LMR then employs label
mixing to learn robust decision boundaries. It achieves state-of-the-art

  Astrophysical Journal",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Metal-poor stars in the Milky Way (MW) halo display large star-to-star
dispersion in their r-process abundance relative to lighter elements. This
suggests a chemically diverse and unmixed interstellar medium (ISM) in the
early Universe. This study aims to help shed light on the impact of turbulent
mixing, driven by core collapse supernovae (cc-SNe), on the r-process abundance
dispersal in galactic disks. To this end, we conduct a series of simulations of
small-scale galaxy patches which resolve metal mixing mechanisms at parsec
scales. Our set-up includes cc-SNe feedback and enrichment from r-process
sources. We find that the relative rate of the r-process events to cc-SNe is
directly imprinted on the shape of the r-process distribution in the ISM with
more frequent events causing more centrally peaked distributions. We consider
also the fraction of metals that is lost on galactic winds and find that cc-SNe
are able to efficiently launch highly enriched winds, especially in smaller
galaxy models. This result suggests that smaller systems, e.g. dwarf galaxies,
may require higher levels of enrichment in order to achieve similar mean
r-process abundances as MW-like progenitors systems. Finally, we are able to
place novel constraints on the production rate of r-process elements in the MW,
$6 \times 10^{-7} {M_\odot / \rm yr} \lesssim \dot{m}_{\rm rp} \ll 4.7 \times
10^{-4} {M_\odot / \rm yr} $, imposed by accurately reproducing the mean and
dispersion of [Eu/Fe] in metal-poor stars. Our results are consistent with
independent estimates from alternate methods and constitute a significant

of the reliability of predictions due to the lack of transparency and black-box
nature of ML models. In materials science and other fields, typical ML model
results include a significant number of low-quality predictions. This problem
is known to be particularly acute for target systems which differ significantly
from the data used for ML model training. However, to date, a general method
for characterization of the difference between the predicted and training
system has not been available. Here, we show that a simple metric based on
Euclidean feature space distance and sampling density allows effective
separation of the accurately predicted data points from data points with poor
prediction accuracy. We show that the metric effectiveness is enhanced by the
decorrelation of the features using Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. To
demonstrate the generality of the method, we apply it to support vector
regression models for various small data sets in materials science and other
fields. Our method is computationally simple, can be used with any ML learning
method and enables analysis of the sources of the ML prediction errors.
Therefore, it is suitable for use as a standard technique for the estimation of
ML prediction reliability for small data sets and as a tool for data set

exploits the existence of universal families and the theory of equivariant

  In the setting of K\""ahler manifolds we first give a new, geometric proof of
Donaldson-Fujiki's moment map interpretation of the scalar curvature.
Associated to arbitrary products of Chern classes of the manifold-namely to a
central charge-we then introduce a geometric PDE determining a Z-critical
K\""ahler metric, and show that these general equations also satisfy moment map
properties. On holomorphic vector bundles, using a similar strategy we give a
geometric proof of Atiyah-Bott's moment map interpretation of the Hermitian
Yang-Mills condition. We go on to give a new, geometric proof that the PDE
determining a Z-critical connection-associated to a choice of central charge on
the category of coherent sheaves-can be viewed as a moment map; deformed
Hermitian Yang-Mills connections are a special case, in which our work gives a
geometric proof of a result of Collins-Yau.
  Our main assertion is that this is the canonical way of producing moment maps

the quasineutrality condition. The equilibrium states are calculated upon
solving an inhomogeneous Beltrami equation that determines the magnetic field,
where the inhomogeneous term is the current density of the kinetic ions and the
homogeneous term represents the electron current density. We show that the
corresponding one-dimensional system is Hamiltonian, with position playing the
role of time, and its trajectories have a regular, periodic behavior for ion
distribution functions that are symmetric in the two conserved particle
canonical momenta. For asymmetric distribution functions, the system is
nonintegrable, resulting in irregular and chaotic behavior of the fields. The
electron current density can modify the magnetic field phase space structure,
inducing orbit trapping and the organization of orbits into large islands of
stability. Thus the electron contribution can be responsible for the emergence
of localized electric field structures that induce ion trapping. We also
provide a paradigm for the analytical construction of hybrid equilibria using a
rotating two-dimensional harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, enabling the
calculation of analytic magnetic fields and the construction of the

activity. Mostly, IDS will be improved by machine learning approaches, but the
model efficiency is degrading because of more headers (or features) present in
the packet (each record). The proposed model extracts practical features using
Non-negative matrix factorization and chi-square analysis. The more number of

Using both techniques, the proposed model makes a hierarchical approach that
will reduce the features quadratic error and noise. The proposed model is

We compute the asymptotics of the graph distance and of the first passage
percolation distance between two uniform vertices, which are respectively
equivalent in probability to $(\log \ell)^2/\pi^2$ and $2(\log \ell)/(\pi^2

$p_{\bf q}$ is a constant which depends on the model. We also show that the

Gromov-Prokhorov or Gromov-Hausdorff for lack of tightness. To study the

industrial applications, such as recommendation and advertising. Conventional
CVR methods typically suffer from the data sparsity problem as they rely only
on samples where the user has clicked. To address this problem, researchers
have introduced the method of multi-task learning, which utilizes non-clicked
samples and shares feature representations of the Click-Through Rate (CTR) task
with the CVR task. However, it should be noted that the CVR and CTR tasks are
fundamentally different and may even be contradictory. Therefore, introducing a
large amount of CTR information without distinction may drown out valuable
information related to CVR. This phenomenon is called the curse of knowledge
problem in this paper. To tackle this issue, we argue that a trade-off should
be achieved between the introduction of large amounts of auxiliary information
and the protection of valuable information related to CVR. Hence, we propose a
Click-aware Structure Transfer model with sample Weight Assignment, abbreviated
as CSTWA. It pays more attention to the latent structure information, which can
filter the input information that is related to CVR, instead of directly
sharing feature representations. Meanwhile, to capture the representation
conflict between CTR and CVR, we calibrate the representation layer and
reweight the discriminant layer to excavate the click bias information from the
CTR tower. Moreover, it incorporates a sample weight assignment algorithm
biased towards CVR modeling, to make the knowledge from CTR would not mislead
the CVR. Extensive experiments on industrial and public datasets have
demonstrated that CSTWA significantly outperforms widely used and competitive
models.

reduce the amount of necessary data. This study applies the data-driven

underlying material yield surface. Based on this, we use a combined
tension-torsion test to cover the knowledge of the yield surface and a single

estimating alpha mattes especially when it is challenging to distinguish
foreground from its background. Exiting deep learning-based methods exploit
specifically designed context aggregation modules to refine encoder features.
However, the effectiveness of these modules has not been thoroughly explored.
In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments to reveal that the context

demonstrate that when learned on large image patches, basic encoder-decoder
networks with a larger receptive field can effectively aggregate context to
achieve better performance.Upon the above findings, we propose a simple yet
effective matting network, named AEMatter, which enlarges the receptive field
by incorporating an appearance-enhanced axis-wise learning block into the
encoder and adopting a hybrid-transformer decoder. Experimental results on four

theory of locality in sumsets, with applications to John-type approximation and
sets with small doubling. First we show that if $A \subset \mathbb{Z}$ with
$|A+A| \le (1-\epsilon) 2^d |A|$ is non-degenerate then $A$ is covered by
$O(2^d)$ translates of a $d$-dimensional generalised arithmetic progression
($d$-GAP) $P$ with $|P| \le O_{d,\epsilon}(|A|)$; thus we obtain one of the
polynomial bounds required by PFR, under the non-degeneracy assumption that $A$
is not efficiently covered by $O_{d,\epsilon}(1)$ translates of a $(d-1)$-GAP.
We also prove a stability result showing for any $\epsilon,\alpha>0$ that if $A
\subset \mathbb{Z}$ with $|A+A| \le (2-\epsilon)2^d|A|$ is non-degenerate then
some $A' \subset A$ with $|A'|>(1-\alpha)|A|$ is efficiently covered by either
a $(d+1)$-GAP or $O_{\alpha}(1)$ translates of a $d$-GAP. This `dimension-free'
bound for approximate covering makes for a stark contrast with exact covering,
where the required number of translates grows exponentially with $d$. We
further show that if $A \subset \mathbb{Z}$ is non-degenerate with $|A+A| \le
(2^d + \ell)|A|$ and $\ell \le 0.1 \cdot 2^d$ then $A$ is covered by $\ell+1$
translates of a $d$-GAP $P$ with $|P| \le O_d(|A|)$; this is tight, in that
$\ell+1$ cannot be replaced by any smaller number. The above results also hold
for $A \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, replacing GAPs by a suitable common
generalisation of GAPs and convex bodies. In this setting the non-degeneracy
condition holds automatically, so we obtain essentially optimal bounds with no
additional assumption on $A$. These results are all deduced from a unifying
theory, in which we introduce a new intrinsic structural approximation of any
set, which we call the `additive hull', and develop its theory via a refinement
of Freiman's theorem with additional separation properties.

We construct the 7-manifold that realizes the domain wall in M-theory by

this direction, we propose Burstormer: a novel transformer-based architecture
for burst image restoration and enhancement. In comparison to existing works,
our approach exploits multi-scale local and non-local features to achieve
improved alignment and feature fusion. Our key idea is to enable inter-frame
communication in the burst neighborhoods for information aggregation and
progressive fusion while modeling the burst-wide context. However, the input
burst frames need to be properly aligned before fusing their information.
Therefore, we propose an enhanced deformable alignment module for aligning
burst features with regards to the reference frame. Unlike existing methods,
the proposed alignment module not only aligns burst features but also exchanges
feature information and maintains focused communication with the reference
frame through the proposed reference-based feature enrichment mechanism, which
facilitates handling complex motions. After multi-level alignment and
enrichment, we re-emphasize on inter-frame communication within burst using a
cyclic burst sampling module. Finally, the inter-frame information is
aggregated using the proposed burst feature fusion module followed by
progressive upsampling. Our Burstormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods on

two-stream methods require passing a great number of (up to a hundred) image
crops into the visuallanguage model, which is highly inefficient. To address
the problem, we propose a network that only needs a single pass through the
visual-language model for each input image. Specifically, we first propose a
novel network adaptation approach, termed patch severance, to restrict the
harmful interference between the patch embeddings in the pre-trained visual
encoder. We then propose classification anchor learning to encourage the
network to spatially focus on more discriminative features for classification.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves outstanding
performance, surpassing state-of-theart methods while being 4 to 7 times faster
at inference. We release our code at https://github.com/CongHan0808/DeOP.git.

can be misleading, because the corresponding Hamiltonian conserves the
component of angular momentum of the inner binary normal to the orbit of the
outer binary, thereby restricting the volume of phase space that the system can

octopole potential, or by allowing the outer orbit to respond to variations in
the inner orbit. However, in a wide variety of astrophysical systems nonlinear

is very likely due to different Galactic components. One of these is the
inelastic scattering of CR nuclei with the atoms of the interstellar medium.
The precise amount of this component determines the eventual contribution from
other sources. We present here a new estimation of the secondary CR positron
flux by incorporating the latest results for the production cross sections of
$e^\pm$ from hadronic scatterings calibrated on collider data. All the
reactions for CR nuclei up to silicon scattering on both hydrogen and helium
are included. The propagation models are derived consistently by fits on
primary and secondary CR nuclei data. Models with a small halo size ($\leq 2$
kpc) are disfavored by the nuclei data although the current uncertainties on
the beryllium nuclear cross sections may impact this result. The resulting
positron flux shows a strong dependence on the Galactic halo. Within the most
reliable propagation models, the positron flux matches the data for energies
below 1 GeV. We verify that secondary positrons contribute less than $70\%$ of
the data already above a few GeV, demonstrating that an excess of positrons is
already present at very low energies. At larger energies, our predictions are
below the data with the discrepancy becoming more pronounced. Our predictions
are provided together with uncertainties due to propagation and hadronic cross
sections. In addition to the predictions of positrons, we provide new
predictions also for the secondary CR electron flux.

$\mathcal{A}$ describes a $(2+1)D$ topological order whose gapped boundaries
enumerate all $(1+1)D$ gapped phases with the fusion category symmetry, which
may be spontaneously broken. There always exists a gapped boundary, given by
the \emph{electric} Lagrangian algebra, that describes a phase with
$\mathcal{A}$ fully spontaneously broken. The symmetry defects of this boundary
can be identified with the objects in $\mathcal{A}$. We observe that if there
exists a different gapped boundary, given by a \emph{magnetic} Lagrangian
algebra, then there exists a gapped phase where $\mathcal{A}$ is not
spontaneously broken at all, which means that $\mathcal{A}$ is not anomalous.
In certain cases, we show that requiring the existence of such a magnetic
Lagrangian algebra leads to highly computable obstructions to $\mathcal{A}$
being anomaly-free. As an application, we consider the Drinfeld centers of
$\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$ Tambara-Yamagami fusion categories and recover

trigger an instability in spinning black holes, tapping their energy and
angular momentum and forming macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensates around them.
This phenomenon produces gaps in the mass-spin distribution of astrophysical
black holes, a continuous gravitational-wave signal emitted by the condensate,
and several environmental effects relevant for gravitational-wave astronomy and
radio images of black holes. While the spectrum of superradiantly unstable mode
is known in great detail for massive scalar (spin-0) and vector (spin-1)
perturbations, so far only approximated results were derived for the case of
massive tensor (spin-2) fields, due to the nonseparability of the field
equations. Here, solving a system of ten elliptic partial differential
equations, we close this program and compute the spectrum of the most unstable
modes of a massive spin-2 field for generic black-hole spin and boson mass,
beyond the hydrogenic approximation and including the unique dipole mode that
dominates the instability in the spin-2 case. We find that the instability
timescale for this mode is orders of magnitude shorter than for any other
superradiant mode, yielding much stronger constraints on massive spin-2 fields.
These results pave the way for phenomenological studies aimed at constraining
beyond Standard Model scenarios, ultralight dark matter candidates, and
extensions to General Relativity using gravitational-wave and electromagnetic
observations, and have implications for the phase diagram of vacuum solutions
of higher-dimensional gravity.

Experts in these methods are with the same model depth, which neglects the fact

Self-Heterogeneous Integration with Knowledge Excavation (SHIKE). We first

applying the pre-trained denoising model. The resulting pseudo-parallel data is
then used to pre-train our multilingual sequence-to-sequence model, PEACH. Our

$S5$-style principles for the reasoning about intutionistic truth (i.e.
\textit{proof}) and, inspired by \cite{artpro}, combined that system with

However, P2 colludes with the observer to reveal P1's secret whenever P2 cannot

against P2. We show that a winning and opacity-enforcing strategy for P1 can be
computed by reducing the problem to solving a reachability game augmented with

gravitational wave transient catalog (GWTC-3) by incorporating discrete latent
variables in the hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to probabilistically
assign each BBH observation into separate categories associated with distinctly
different population distributions. By incorporating formation channel
knowledge within the mass and spin correlations found in each category, we find
an over density of mergers with a primary mass of $\sim10 M_\odot$, consistent
with isolated binary formation. This low-mass subpopulation has a spin
magnitude distribution peaking at $a_\mathrm{peak}=0.16^{0.19}_{-0.16}$,
exhibits spins preferentially aligned with the binary's orbital angular
momentum, is constrained by $15^{+0.0}_{-1.0}$ of our observations, and
contributes $82\%^{+8.0\%}_{-16\%}$ to the overall population of BBHs.
Additionally, we find that the component of the mass distribution containing
the previously identified $35M_\odot$ peak has spins consistent with the
$10M_\odot$ events, with $99\%$ of primary masses less than $m_{1,99\%} =
49^{+25}_{-8.1} M_\odot$, providing an estimate of the lower edge of the

instability cannot be described by classical rod theory, which incorporates
pre-stress through effective natural curvature and twist; these are both zero
due to the mirror symmetry of the pre-stress. Using dimension reduction, we
derive a one-dimensional (1D) 'rod-like' model from a plate theory, which
accounts for inhomogeneous pre-stress as well as finite rotations. The 1D model
successfully captures the qualitative features of torsional buckling under a
prescribed end-to-end displacement and rotation, including the co-existence of
buckled phases possessing opposite twist, and is in good quantitative agreement
with the results of numerical (finite-element) simulations and model

kernel of the GP and its partial derivatives at collocation points.
  We present a sparse Cholesky factorization algorithm for such kernel matrices
based on the near-sparsity of the Cholesky factor under a new ordering of
Diracs and derivative measurements. We rigorously identify the sparsity pattern
and quantify the exponentially convergent accuracy of the corresponding Vecchia
approximation of the GP, which is optimal in the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
This enables us to compute $\epsilon$-approximate inverse Cholesky factors of
the kernel matrices with complexity $O(N\log^d(N/\epsilon))$ in space and
$O(N\log^{2d}(N/\epsilon))$ in time.
  With the sparse factors, gradient-based optimization methods become scalable.
Furthermore, we can use the oftentimes more efficient Gauss-Newton method, for
which we apply the conjugate gradient algorithm with the sparse factor of a
reduced kernel matrix as a preconditioner to solve the linear system. We
numerically illustrate our algorithm's near-linear space/time complexity for a
broad class of nonlinear PDEs such as the nonlinear elliptic, Burgers, and
Monge-Amp\`ere equations. In summary, we provide a fast, scalable, and accurate

polymer network from the behavior of a single polymer chain (e.g. viscoelastic
response to applied forces, applied electromagnetic fields, etc.). Network
models have been used for multiscale phenomena in a variety of contexts such as
rubber elasticity, soft multifunctional materials, biological materials, and
even the curing of polymers. For decades, a myriad of polymer network models
have been developed with differing numbers of chains, arranged in different
ways, and with differing symmetries. To complicate matters further, there are
also competing assumptions for how macroscopic variables (e.g. deformation) are
related to individual chains within the network model. In this work, we propose
a simple, intuitive assumption for how the network locally rotates relative to
applied loading (e.g. stresses, external fields) and show that this assumption
unifies many of the disparate polymer network models--while also recovering one
of the most successful models for rubber elasticity, the Arruda-Boyce $8$-chain
model. The new assumption is then shown to make more intuitive predictions
(than prior models) for stimuli-responsive networks with orientational energies
(e.g. electroactive polymers), which is significant for shape morphing and
designing high degree of freedom actuators (e.g. for soft robotics). Lastly, we

the $\beta$ Pic moving group. PZ Tel A exhibits an astrometric acceleration
between Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3, which enables the direct determination of the
companion's mass. We have also acquired new Keck/NIRC2 adaptive optics imaging
of the system, which increases the total baseline of relative astrometry to 15
years. Our joint orbit fit yields a dynamical mass of $27^{+25}_{-9} \,
M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$, semi-major axis of $27^{+14}_{-4} \, \mathrm{au}$,
eccentricity of $0.52^{+0.08}_{-0.10}$, and inclination of
$91.73^{+0.36}_{-0.32} {}^\circ$. The companion's mass is consistent within
$1.1\sigma$ of predictions from four grids of hot-start evolutionary models.
The joint orbit fit also indicates a more modest eccentricity of PZ Tel B than
previous results. PZ Tel joins a small number of young (${<}200 \,

efficient communication through constrained channels. While channels with fixed
constraints have a general optimal solution, there is increasing demand for
parametric constraints that are dependent on the message length. Several works
have tackled such parametric constraints through iterative algorithms, yet they
require complex constructions specific to each constraint to guarantee
convergence through monotonic progression. In this paper, we propose a
universal framework for tackling any parametric constrained-channel problem
through a novel simple iterative algorithm. By reducing an execution of this
iterative algorithm to an acyclic graph traversal, we prove a surprising result
that guarantees convergence with efficient average time complexity even without
requiring any monotonic progression.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of this universal framework by applying it
to a variety of both local and global channel constraints. We begin by
exploring the local constraints involving illegal substrings of variable
length, where the universal construction essentially iteratively replaces
forbidden windows. We apply this local algorithm to the minimal periodicity,
minimal Hamming weight, local almost-balanced Hamming weight and the
previously-unsolved minimal palindrome constraints. We then continue by
exploring global constraints, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
construction on the repeat-free encoding, reverse-complement encoding, and the
open problem of global almost-balanced encoding. For reverse-complement, we
also tackle a previously-unsolved version of the constraint that addresses
overlapping windows. Overall, the proposed framework generates state-of-the-art
constructions with significant ease while also enabling the simultaneous
integration of multiple constraints for the first time.

low-dimensional manifold whose dimension can be readily obtained from the
fluctuations. Furthermore, this dimension is controlled by the number of data
points that reside near the classification decision boundary. Importantly, we
find that a quadratic approximation of the loss near the minimum is
fundamentally inadequate due to the exponential nature of the decision boundary
and the flatness of the low-loss region. This causes the dynamics to sample
regions with higher curvature at higher temperatures, while producing
quadratic-like statistics at any given temperature. We explain this behavior by
a simplified loss model which is analytically tractable and reproduces the
observed fluctuation statistics.

monitoring purposes experience time- and spatially-varying natural backgrounds
and encounters with man-made nuisance sources. In order to be sensitive to
illicit sources, such systems must be able to distinguish those sources from
benign variations due to, e.g., weather and human activity. In addition to
fluctuations due to non-threats, each detector has its own response and energy
resolution, so providing a large network of detectors with predetermined
background and source templates can be an onerous task. Instead, we propose
that static detectors automatically learn the background and nuisance source
signatures by using algorithms to bootstrap and inform more complex algorithms.
Specifically, we show that non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) can be used
to distinguish static background from the effects of increased concentrations
of radon progeny due to rainfall. We also show that a simple process of using
multiple gross count rate filters can be used in real time to classify or
``triage'' spectra according to whether they belong to static, rain, or
anomalous categories for processing with other algorithms. If a rain sensor is
available, we propose a method to incorporate that signal as well. Two
clustering methods for anomalous spectra are proposed, one using
Kullback-Leibler divergence and the other using regularized NMF, with the goal
of finding clusters of similar spectral anomalies that can be used to build
anomaly templates. Finally we describe the implementation of some of these
algorithms on deployed sensor nodes, including methods to monitor the
background models for long-term drifting due to physical changes in the

independent of the time delay distributions up to $z \sim 14$ and the accuracy
of the reconstruction strongly depends on the time delay distribution only at
high redshifts of $z\gtrsim 14$. We define the termination redshift as the
redshift where the SFR drops to 1\% of its peak value. In this analysis we

as the self-gravity effect due to a large mass of the collapsing stellar core
falling onto black hole in a very short time. We also investigate the existence
of accretion shocks in the collapsar, and role of magnetic field in their
propagation. We compute the time-dependent axially-symmetric General
Relativistic magnetohydrodynamic model of a collapsing stellar core in the
dynamical Kerr metric. We explore the influence of self-gravity in such star,
where the newly formed black hole is increasing the mass, and changing its
spin. The Kerr metric evolves according to the mass and angular momentum
changes during the collapse. We parameterize the rotation inside the star, and
account for the presence of large-scale poloidal magnetic field. For the set of
the global parameters, such as the initial black hole spin, and initial content
of specific angular momentum in the stellar envelope, we determine the
evolution of black hole parameters (mass and spin) and we quantify the strength
of the gravitational instability, variability timescales and amplitudes. We
find that the role of the gravitational instability measured by the value of
the Toomre parameter is relatively important in the innermost regions of the
collapsing star. The character of accretion rate variability strongly depends
on the assumption of self-gravity in the model, and is also affected by the
magnetic field. Additional factors are initial spin and rotation of the stellar
core.

2017) that identifies relations between chemical compounds and genes/proteins
in scientific literature. ChemProt is included in all recent biomedical natural
language processing benchmarks including BLUE, BLURB, and BigBio. However, its
treatment in these benchmarks and in other separate efforts is typically not
end-to-end, with few exceptions. In this effort, we employ a span-based
pipeline approach to produce a new state-of-the-art E2ERE performance on the
ChemProt dataset, resulting in $> 4\%$ improvement in F1-score over the prior
best effort. Our results indicate that a straightforward fine-grained
tokenization scheme helps span-based approaches excel in E2ERE, especially with
regards to handling complex named entities. Our error analysis also identifies
a few key failure modes in E2ERE for ChemProt.

group testing problem for which: (1) positives occur within a burst, capturing
the fact that infected test subjects often come in clusters, and (2) that the
test outcomes arise from semiquantitative measurements that provide coarse
information about the number of positives in any tested group. Our model
generalizes prior work on detecting a single burst of positives with classical
group testing[1] as well as work on semiquantitative group testing (SQGT)[2].
Specifically, we study the setting where the burst-length $\ell$ is known and
the semiquantitative tests provide potentially nonuniform estimates on the
number of positives in a test group. The estimates represent the index of a
quantization bin containing the (exact) total number of positives, for
arbitrary thresholds $\eta_1,\dots,\eta_s$. Interestingly, we show that the
minimum number of tests needed for burst identification is essentially only a
function of the largest threshold $\eta_s$. In this context, our main result is
an order-optimal test scheme that can recover any burst of length $\ell$ using
roughly $\frac{\ell}{2\eta_s}+\log_{s+1}(n)$ measurements. This suggests that a
large saturation level $\eta_s$ is more important than finely quantized
information when dealing with bursts. We also provide results for related

applications, but we are interested in a variety of problems where systematic
mislabelings of the sample prevent us from applying the existing theory. To
apply distribution testing to these problems, we introduce distribution testing
under the parity trace, where the algorithm receives an ordered sample $S$ that
reveals only the least significant bit of each element. This abstraction
reveals connections between the following three problems of interest, allowing
new upper and lower bounds:
  1. In distribution testing with a confused collector, the collector of the
sample may be incapable of distinguishing between nearby elements of a domain
(e.g. a machine learning classifier). We prove bounds for distribution testing
with a confused collector on domains structured as a cycle or a path.
  2. Recent work on the fundamental testing vs. learning question established
tight lower bounds on distribution-free sample-based property testing by
reduction from distribution testing, but the tightness is limited to symmetric
properties. The parity trace allows a broader family of equivalences to
non-symmetric properties, while recovering and strengthening many of the
previous results with a different technique.
  3. We give the first results for property testing in the well-studied trace
reconstruction model, where the goal is to test whether an unknown string $x$
satisfies some property or is far from satisfying that property, given only
independent random traces of $x$.
  Our main technical result is a tight bound of $\widetilde
\Theta\left((n/\epsilon)^{4/5} + \sqrt n/\epsilon^2\right)$ for testing
uniformity of distributions over $[n]$ under the parity trace, leading also to
results for the problems above.

moisture content from environmental exposure on the cure kinetics of an
infusion resin system used in wind turbine blade manufacturing and repair and
provides an experimentally validated finite element tool for the analysis of
cure cycle repairs as a function of repair geometry and moisture content.
Moisture absorption tests on the two-part infusion system reported up to 12%
moisture uptake by the curing agent under high temperature and relative
humidity conditions. Differential scanning calorimetric measurements of resin
in the presence of moisture revealed an accelerated cure behavior. Numerical
predictions of a repair model agreed very well with the corresponding lab-scale
repair and revealed a substantial temperature lag within the repair patch which
resulted in thermal gradients and spatial distribution of the degree of cure.
It was shown that the repair geometry and the accelerated-cure kinetics greatly
influenced the temperature and cure distribution within the repair. The
proposed approach can be used to reduce turbine downtime by minimizing the
curing time.

network solution. To ensure a reliable transmission, and to meet service level
agreements, PON systems have to be monitored constantly in order to quickly
identify and localize networks faults. Typically, a service disruption in a PON
system is mainly due to fiber cuts and optical network unit (ONU)
transmitter/receiver failures. When the ONUs are located at different distances
from the optical line terminal (OLT), the faulty ONU or branch can be
identified by analyzing the recorded optical time domain reflectometry (OTDR)
traces. However, faulty branch isolation becomes very challenging when the
reflections originating from two or more branches with similar length overlap,
which makes it very hard to discriminate the faulty branches given the global
backscattered signal. Recently, machine learning (ML) based approaches have
shown great potential for managing optical faults in PON systems. Such
techniques perform well when trained and tested with data derived from the same
PON system. But their performance may severely degrade, if the PON system
(adopted for the generation of the training data) has changed, e.g. by adding
more branches or varying the length difference between two neighboring
branches. etc. A re-training of the ML models has to be conducted for each
network change, which can be time consuming. In this paper, to overcome the
aforementioned issues, we propose a generic ML approach trained independently
of the network architecture for identifying the faulty branch in PON systems
given OTDR signals for the cases of branches with close lengths. Such an
approach can be applied to an arbitrary PON system without requiring to be
re-trained for each change of the network. The proposed approach is validated
using experimental data derived from PON system.

limited by their reliance on pre-trained models that have not be designed
specifically for pose estimation. In this paper we propose PoseMatcher, an
accurate model free one-shot object pose estimator that overcomes these
limitations. We create a new training pipeline for object to image matching
based on a three-view system: a query with a positive and negative templates.
This simple yet effective approach emulates test time scenarios by cheaply
constructing an approximation of the full object point cloud during training.
To enable PoseMatcher to attend to distinct input modalities, an image and a
pointcloud, we introduce IO-Layer, a new attention layer that efficiently
accommodates self and cross attention between the inputs. Moreover, we propose
a pruning strategy where we iteratively remove redundant regions of the target
object to further reduce the complexity and noise of the network while
maintaining accuracy. Finally we redesign commonly used pose refinement
strategies, zoom and 2D offset refinements, and adapt them to the one-shot
paradigm. We outperform all prior one-shot pose estimation methods on the
Linemod and YCB-V datasets as well achieve results rivaling recent
instance-level methods. The source code and models are available at

ratios of the extended radio sub-regions of DR7 and K3-50 to estimate their

K3-50 likely indicates that the star-forming complex has undergone multiple
star-forming events separated more widely in time, whereas the smaller spread
in DR7 likely indicates the star formation sub-regions are more co-eval. DR7
and K3-50 have Lyman continuum photon rates just above the formal threshold

Thus, the U-Netmer can be trained with different patch sizes to solve the
``scale-sensitivity"" problem. We conduct extensive experiments in 7 public
datasets on 7 organs (brain, heart, breast, lung, polyp, pancreas and prostate)
and 4 imaging modalities (MRI, CT, ultrasound, and endoscopy) to show that the

is linearly correlated to the segmentation accuracy which can be considered as
a confidence score to rank test images by difficulty without ground-truth.

safety and efficiency by exploiting information from surrounding vehicles via
V2V communication. A CAV typically adapts its speed based on information from
the vehicle it follows. CAVs can also use information from vehicles further
ahead within their communication range, and this results in improved traffic
safety and efficiency. In mixed traffic scenarios, however, this may not always
be possible due to the presence of human-driven vehicles that do not have
communication capabilities. Furthermore, as wireless vehicular networks are
unreliable, information from other vehicles can be delayed or lost, which
brings more challenges for CAVs in utilizing information from multiple leading
vehicles. A few studies have investigated the impact of CAVs where they use
information from multiple leading vehicles on traffic safety and efficiency,
but only in very limited scenarios (i.e., with a very small number of
vehicles).
  In contrast, this paper investigates the impact of CAV car-following control
based on multiple leading vehicles information on both mixed traffic safety and
efficiency in realistic scenarios in terms of imperfect communication, vehicle
modelling, and traffic scenario. Results show that exploiting information from
multiple, rather than a single, leading vehicles in CAV controller design
further improves both traffic safety and efficiency especially at high
penetration rates. In addition to proper tuning of CAV controller parameters
(control gains and time headways), the scale of the improvement depends on both
market penetration rate (MPR) and communication reliability. A packet error
rate (PER) of 70% leads to an increase in traffic efficiency by 4.18% (at 40%
MPR) and 12.19% (at 70% MPR), compared to the simple single leading vehicle
information based controller.

surface is fundamental. The conventional approach involves measuring the
relevant physical properties point-by-point at the predetermined mesh grid
points on the surface and determining the area at which the property does not
reach the desired level. To identify defective areas more efficiently, we
propose adaptive mapping methods in which measurement resources are used
preferentially to detect the boundaries of defective areas. We interpret this
problem as an active-learning (AL) of the level set estimation (LSE) problem.
The goal of AL-based LSE is to determine the level set of the physical property
function defined on the surface with as small number of measurements as
possible. Furthermore, to handle the situations in which materials with similar
specifications are repeatedly produced, we introduce a transfer learning
approach so that the information of previously produced materials can be
effectively utilized. As a proof-of-concept, we applied the proposed methods to
the red-zone estimation problem of silicon wafers and demonstrated that we
could identify the defective areas with significantly lower measurement costs

area, latency, and power consumption, compared with the use of standard add or
fused multiply-add units. However, non-monotonicity can appear when computing
sums with a subclass of multi-term addition units, which currently is not

computationally challenging to solve due to the large number of scenarios
needed to accurately represent the uncertainties. To mitigate the computational
issues, many techniques have been proposed to approximate the second-stage

policies to approximate the second-stage decisions is that these solutions need
to be feasible, which has been difficult to achieve with existing policies.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a learning method to solve
the two-stage problem in a more efficient and optimal way. A technique called
the gauge map is incorporated into the learning architecture design to
guarantee the learned solutions' feasibility to the network constraints.
Namely, we can design policies that are feed forward functions that only output

incorporate yield-stress effects and capillary and Marangoni forces. Using
numerical simulations and asymptotic analysis of the thin-film system, we
quantify how the presence of surfactant slows growth of the Rayleigh-Plateau

surfactant strength is large, the thin-film dynamics coincide with the dynamics

chiral skin effect, i.e., Chiral modes + Dissipation $\rightarrow $\ Chiral

non-local non-Hermitian skin effect, which causes the topological edge state of

  Twitter","6 pages",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Keyword extraction is a crucial process in text mining. The extraction of
keywords with respective contextual events in Twitter data is a big challenge.
The challenging issues are mainly because of the informality in the language
used. The use of misspelled words, acronyms, and ambiguous terms causes
informality. The extraction of keywords with informal language in current
systems is pattern based or event based. In this paper, contextual keywords are
extracted using thematic events with the help of data association. The thematic
context for events is identified using the uncertainty principle in the
proposed system. The thematic contexts are weighed with the help of vectors
called thematic context vectors which signifies the event as certain or
uncertain. The system is tested on the Twitter COVID-19 dataset and proves to
be effective. The system extracts event-specific thematic context vectors from
the test dataset and ranks them. The extracted thematic context vectors are
used for the clustering of contextual thematic vectors which improves the
silhouette coefficient by 0.5% than state of art methods namely TF and TF-IDF.
The thematic context vector can be used in other applications like
Cyberbullying, sarcasm detection, figurative language detection, etc.

magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on FeSe$_{0.91}$S$_{0.09}$ under

between antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations and superconducting
transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) where the AFM spin fluctuations are more
effective in enhancing $T_{\rm c}$ in the absence of nematicity than with
nematicity. Motivated by the work, we carried out $^{77}$Se NMR measurements on
FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ with $x$= 0.15 and 0.29 under pressure up to 2.10 GPa to
investigate the relationship in a wide range of $x$ in the FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$

superconducting (SC) state in nematic state arises from a non Fermi liquid

nematicity comes from a Fermi liquid state with mild stripe-type AFM spin

nematicity on the relationship between AFM fluctuations and superconductivity
holds throughout the wide range of $x$ from $x$ = 0 to 0.29 in

adversarial conditional encoder-decoder architecture based on Slot Attention,
modified to use the image as context to decode optical flow without attempting

one modality (flow) feeds the encoder to produce separate latent codes (slots),
whereas the other modality (image) conditions the decoder to generate the first

encode complex nuisance variability in the image due to, for instance,
illumination and reflectance properties of the scene. Since customary
autoencoding based on minimizing the reconstruction error does not preclude the
entire flow from being encoded into a single slot, we modify the loss to an
adversarial criterion based on Contextual Information Separation. The resulting
min-max optimization fosters the separation of objects and their assignment to
different attention slots, leading to Divided Attention, or DivA. DivA
outperforms recent unsupervised multi-object motion segmentation methods while
tripling run-time speed up to 104FPS and reducing the performance gap from
supervised methods to 12% or less. DivA can handle different numbers of objects

consumption. However, the current irrigation systems used in the field are not
efficient. They rely mainly on soil moisture sensors and the experience of
growers, but do not account for future soil moisture loss. Predicting soil
moisture loss is challenging because it is influenced by numerous factors,
including soil texture, weather conditions, and plant characteristics. This
paper proposes a solution to improve irrigation efficiency, which is called
DRLIC. DRLIC is a sophisticated irrigation system that uses deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) to optimize its performance. The system employs a neural
network, known as the DRL control agent, which learns an optimal control policy
that considers both the current soil moisture measurement and the future soil
moisture loss. We introduce an irrigation reward function that enables our
control agent to learn from previous experiences. However, there may be
instances where the output of our DRL control agent is unsafe, such as
irrigating too much or too little water. To avoid damaging the health of the
plants, we implement a safety mechanism that employs a soil moisture predictor
to estimate the performance of each action. If the predicted outcome is deemed
unsafe, we perform a relatively-conservative action instead. To demonstrate the
real-world application of our approach, we developed an irrigation system that
comprises sprinklers, sensing and control nodes, and a wireless network. We
evaluate the performance of DRLIC by deploying it in a testbed consisting of
six almond trees. During a 15-day in-field experiment, we compared the water
consumption of DRLIC with a widely-used irrigation scheme. Our results indicate
that DRLIC outperformed the traditional irrigation method by achieving a water
savings of up to 9.52%.

particularly significant for designing quantum thermodynamical devices. With
the technology of experiment advances, circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit
QED) has become a promising system due to controllable light matter
interactions as well as flexible coupling strengths. In this paper, we design a
thermal diode in terms of the two-photon Rabi model of the circuit QED system.
We find that the thermal diode can not only be realized in the resonant
coupling but also achieve better performance, especially for the detuned
qubit-photon ultrastrong coupling. We also study the photonic detection rates
and their nonreciprocity, which indicates similar behaviors with the
nonreciprocal heat transport. This provides the potential to understand thermal
diode behavior from the quantum optical perspective and could shed new insight
into the relevant research on thermodynamical devices.

addresses backend challenges through an architecture that is serverless,
distributive, auto-scaling, highly resilient, and secure. The platform offers a
scalable, hardware-free solution for users to experience a near-immersive

reasoning paradigm where agents anticipate the learning steps of other agents
to improve cooperation among themselves. As MARL uses gradient-based
optimization, learning anticipation requires using Higher-Order Gradients
(HOG), with so-called HOG methods. Existing HOG methods are based on policy
parameter anticipation, i.e., agents anticipate the changes in policy
parameters of other agents. Currently, however, these existing HOG methods have
only been applied to differentiable games or games with small state spaces. In
this work, we demonstrate that in the case of non-differentiable games with
large state spaces, existing HOG methods do not perform well and are
inefficient due to their inherent limitations related to policy parameter
anticipation and multiple sampling stages. To overcome these problems, we
propose Off-Policy Action Anticipation (OffPA2), a novel framework that
approaches learning anticipation through action anticipation, i.e., agents
anticipate the changes in actions of other agents, via off-policy sampling. We
theoretically analyze our proposed OffPA2 and employ it to develop multiple HOG
methods that are applicable to non-differentiable games with large state
spaces. We conduct a large set of experiments and illustrate that our proposed
HOG methods outperform the existing ones regarding efficiency and performance.

normalized monotone-increasing valuation functions from $2^M$ to
$\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, parameterized by an integer $q \in [2,m]$. For a given
$q$, we refer to the class as $q$-partitioning. A valuation function is
subadditive if and only if it is $2$-partitioning, and fractionally subadditive
if and only if it is $m$-partitioning. Thus, our chain establishes an
interpolation between subadditive and fractionally subadditive valuations. We
show that this interpolation is smooth, interpretable , and non-trivial. We
interpolate prior results that separate subadditive and fractionally
subadditive for all $q \in \{2,\ldots, m\}$. Two highlights are the
following:(i) An $\Omega \left(\frac{\log \log q}{\log \log
m}\right)$-competitive posted price mechanism for $q$-partitioning valuations.
Note that this matches asymptotically the state-of-the-art for both subadditive
($q=2$) [DKL20], and fractionally subadditive ($q=m$) [FGL15]. (ii)Two
upper-tail concentration inequalities on $1$-Lipschitz, $q$-partitioning

to $q<m$, the other improves the state-of-the-art for $q=2$ for $q > 2$. Our
concentration inequalities imply several corollaries that interpolate between
subadditive and fractionally subadditive, for example: $\mathbb{E}[v(S)]\le (1
+ 1/\log q)\text{Median}[v(S)] + O(\log q)$. To prove this, we develop a new
isoperimetric inequality using Talagrand's method of control by $q$ points,
which may be of independent interest. We also discuss other probabilistic
inequalities and game-theoretic applications of $q$-partitioning valuations,
and connections to subadditive MPH-$k$ valuations [EFNTW19].

transformer (ViT) has achieved promising success in both holistic and occluded

transformers such as the huge computational cost and memory footprint are still
two unsolved issues that will block the deployment of ViT based person Re-ID
models on resource-limited edge devices. Our goal is to reduce both the
inference complexity and model size without sacrificing the comparable accuracy
on person Re-ID, especially for tasks with occlusion. To this end, we propose a
novel attention map guided (AMG) transformer pruning method, which removes both
redundant tokens and heads with the guidance of the attention map in a
hardware-friendly way. We first calculate the entropy in the key dimension and
sum it up for the whole map, and the corresponding head parameters of maps with
high entropy will be removed for model size reduction. Then we combine the
similarity and first-order gradients of key tokens along the query dimension
for token importance estimation and remove redundant key and value tokens to
further reduce the inference complexity. Comprehensive experiments on Occluded
DukeMTMC and Market-1501 demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposals. For
example, our proposed pruning strategy on ViT-Base enjoys
\textup{\textbf{29.4\%}} \textup{\textbf{FLOPs}} savings with

network architecture that integrates time-space-frequency features, effectively
compensating for the limitations of single-mode feature extraction networks
based on time-series or time-frequency modalities. TSFF-Net comprises four main
components: time-frequency representation, time-frequency feature extraction,
time-space feature extraction, and feature fusion and classification.
Time-frequency representation and feature extraction transform raw EEG signals
into time-frequency spectrograms and extract relevant features. The time-space
network processes time-series EEG trials as input and extracts temporal-spatial
features. Feature fusion employs MMD loss to constrain the distribution of
time-frequency and time-space features in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space,
subsequently combining these features using a weighted fusion approach to
obtain effective time-space-frequency features. Moreover, few studies have
explored the decoding of three-channel motor imagery based on time-frequency
spectrograms. This study proposes a shallow, lightweight decoding architecture
(TSFF-img) based on time-frequency spectrograms and compares its classification
performance in low-channel motor imagery with other methods using two publicly
available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that TSFF-Net not only
compensates for the shortcomings of single-mode feature extraction networks in
EEG decoding, but also outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Overall,
TSFF-Net offers considerable advantages in decoding low-channel motor imagery
and provides valuable insights for algorithmically enhancing low-channel EEG
decoding.

datasets with high-quality 3D annotations. However, such 3D annotations are
often expensive and time-consuming, which may not be practical for real
applications. A natural remedy is to adopt semi-supervised learning (SSL) by
leveraging a limited amount of labeled samples and abundant unlabeled samples.
Current pseudolabeling-based SSL object detection methods mainly adopt a
teacher-student framework, with a single fixed threshold strategy to generate
supervision signals, which inevitably brings confused supervision when guiding
the student network training. Besides, the data augmentation of the point cloud
in the typical teacher-student framework is too weak, and only contains basic
down sampling and flip-and-shift (i.e., rotate and scaling), which hinders the
effective learning of feature information. Hence, we address these issues by
introducing a novel approach of Hierarchical Supervision and Shuffle Data
Augmentation (HSSDA), which is a simple yet effective teacher-student
framework. The teacher network generates more reasonable supervision for the
student network by designing a dynamic dual-threshold strategy. Besides, the
shuffle data augmentation strategy is designed to strengthen the feature
representation ability of the student network. Extensive experiments show that
HSSDA consistently outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on different
datasets. The code will be released at https://github.com/azhuantou/HSSDA.

supports grid-free channel delay and Doppler and gains a simple and efficient

problems (NLP), where some of its equality constraints define a closed embedded
submanifold $\mathcal{M}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Although NLP can be solved
directly by various existing approaches for constrained optimization in
Euclidean space, these approaches usually fail to recognize the manifold
structure of $\mathcal{M}$. To achieve better efficiency by utilizing the
manifold structure of $\mathcal{M}$ in directly applying these existing
optimization approaches, we propose a partial penalty function approach for
NLP. In our proposed penalty function approach, we transform NLP into the
corresponding constraint dissolving problem (CDP) in the Euclidean space, where
the constraints that define $\mathcal{M}$ are eliminated through exact
penalization. We establish the relationships on the constraint qualifications
between NLP and CDP, and prove that NLP and CDP have the same stationary points
and KKT points in a neighborhood of the feasible region under mild conditions.
Therefore, various existing optimization approaches developed for constrained
optimization in the Euclidean space can be directly applied to solve NLP
through CDP. Preliminary numerical experiments demonstrate that by dissolving
the constraints that define $\mathcal{M}$, CDP gains superior computational
efficiency when compared to directly applying existing optimization approaches
to solve NLP, especially in high dimensional scenarios.

processing and is an important tool for improving the quality and efficiency of

entanglement distillation scheme using only one pair of polarization-frequency
hyperentangled photons, which can be equivalently viewed as containing two
pairs of entangled logical qubits: a pair of polarization-entangled qubits and
a pair of frequency-entangled qubits. To perform the required CNOT operation
between the two qubits we consider the use of a polarization-dependent
frequency converter. Compared to past methods of entanglement distillation that
relied on polarization and spatial-mode/energy-time degree of freedom, the
utilization of frequency-encoded qubits offers an advantage in that it is
immune to bit-flip errors when the channel is linear. After distillation, the
fidelity of polarization entanglement can be significantly improved by
sacrificing the frequency degree of freedom. Through simulation, we show that
high fidelity gains, large yield, and high distillation rate can be achieved.
Our distillation scheme is simple to implement with current technologies,
compatible with existing telecommunication fiber networks, and is a promising
approach for achieving efficient quantum communication.

promising performance. However, it generally relies on annotated images for

the development of unsupervised DL-based brain tumor segmentation approaches
without expert annotations is desired. Motivated by the success of prompt
learning (PL) in natural language processing, we propose an approach to
unsupervised brain tumor segmentation by designing image-based prompts that
allow indication of brain tumors, and this approach is dubbed as PL-based Brain
Tumor Segmentation (PL-BTS). Specifically, instead of directly training a model
for brain tumor segmentation with a large amount of annotated data, we seek to
train a model that can answer the question: is a voxel in the input image
associated with tumor-like hyper-/hypo-intensity? Such a model can be trained
by artificially generating tumor-like hyper-/hypo-intensity on images without
tumors with hand-crafted designs. Since the hand-crafted designs may be too
simplistic to represent all kinds of real tumors, the trained model may overfit
the simplistic hand-crafted task rather than actually answer the question of
abnormality. To address this problem, we propose the use of a validation task,
where we generate a different hand-crafted task to monitor overfitting. In
addition, we propose PL-BTS+ that further improves PL-BTS by exploiting
unannotated images with brain tumors. Compared with competing unsupervised
methods, the proposed method has achieved marked improvements on both public
and in-house datasets, and we have also demonstrated its possible extension to
other brain lesion segmentation tasks.

capabilities. Unlike humans, these models learn language exclusively from

they can generate seemingly meaningful text about a wide range of topics. This
impressive accomplishment has rekindled interest in the classical 'Symbol
Grounding Problem,' which questioned whether the internal representations and
outputs of classical symbolic AI systems could possess intrinsic meaning.
Unlike these systems, modern LLMs are artificial neural networks that compute
over vectors rather than symbols. However, an analogous problem arises for such
systems, which we dub the Vector Grounding Problem. This paper has two primary
objectives. First, we differentiate various ways in which internal
representations can be grounded in biological or artificial systems,
identifying five distinct notions discussed in the literature: referential,
sensorimotor, relational, communicative, and epistemic grounding.
Unfortunately, these notions of grounding are often conflated. We clarify the
differences between them, and argue that referential grounding is the one that
lies at the heart of the Vector Grounding Problem. Second, drawing on theories
of representational content in philosophy and cognitive science, we propose
that certain LLMs, particularly those fine-tuned with Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF), possess the necessary features to overcome the
Vector Grounding Problem, as they stand in the requisite causal-historical
relations to the world that underpin intrinsic meaning. We also argue that,
perhaps unexpectedly, multimodality and embodiment are neither necessary nor
sufficient conditions for referential grounding in artificial systems.

dipole approximation (DDA) method. The stochastic random walk approach was
adopted to generate a force-biased packing model for multicellular filamentous
cyanobacterial aggregates. The effects of shape and size of multicellular
cyanobacterial aggregates on their scattering properties were investigated by
this work. The possibility of invariance in the scattering properties was
explored for cyanobacterial aggregates. The invariance interpretation
intuitively represented the radiative property characteristics of the
aggregates. The presented results show that the ratios of the matrix elements
of cyanobacterial aggregates are nearly shape, size, and wavelength invariant.
The extinction and absorption cross-sections (EACSs) per unit volume were shape
and approximate size invariance of cyanobacterial aggregates, respectively. The
absorption cross-section of aggregates is not merely a volumetric phenomenon
for aggregates that exceed a certain size. Furthermore, the absorption
cross-sections per unit volume are independent of the volumetric distribution
of the microalgae cells. The invariance interpretation presents crucial
characteristics of the scattering properties of cyanobacterial aggregates. The
existence of invariance greatly improves our understanding of the scattering
properties of microalgal aggregates. The scattering properties of microalgal
aggregates are the most critical aspects of light propagation in the design,
optimization, and operation of photobioreactors.

reducing the reconstruction latency of such inherently sequential algorithms is

application optimizations introduce data-level parallelism by splitting the

(b) system optimizations incorporate task-level parallelism to the pipelines by
running them opportunistically on available resources with online quality

contrastive transfer framework to detect rumors by adapting the features
learned from well-resourced rumor data to that of the low-resourced with only
few-shot annotations. More specifically, we first represent rumor circulated on
social media as an undirected topology for enhancing the interaction of user

unified contrastive paradigm to mine effective clues simultaneously from post

representation learning using a small set of annotated target events, we reveal
that rumor-indicative signal is closely correlated with the uniformity of the

unifying the representations by distinguishing target events. Extensive

dynamics changes across time, leading to complex consequences on a global
scale. In this study, we propose a generalized Laplacian dynamics model to
describe both convergent and divergent swarm behaviors, where the trends of
convergence and divergence compete with each other and jointly determine the
evolution of global patterns. We empirically observe non-trivial
phase-transition-like phenomena between the convergent and divergent evolution
phases, which are controlled by local interaction properties. We also propose a

parallel losses can be modelled analytically. A confining potential is set up

Radiation losses such as Bremsstrahlung and cyclotron are taken into account. A
neutrals model is included, and in some circumstances, charge-exchange losses
are found to exceed all other loss mechanisms. We use the SUNDIALS ARKODE
library to solve the underlying equations of this model; the resulting software

we present a new dual convolutional neural network (CNN) with attention for
image blind denoising, named as the DCANet. To the best of our knowledge, the
proposed DCANet is the first work that integrates both the dual CNN and
attention mechanism for image denoising. The DCANet is composed of a noise

spatial distribution and the noise level in an image. The noisy image and its
estimated noise are combined as the input of the SCAM, and a dual CNN contains
two different branches is designed to learn the complementary features to
obtain the denoised image. The experimental results have verified that the

series analysis that supports various downstream tasks, including time series
anomaly detection and forecasting. However, existing decomposition methods rely
on batch processing with a time complexity of O(W), where W is the number of
data points within a time window. Therefore, they cannot always efficiently
support real-time analysis that demands low processing delay. To address this
challenge, we propose OneShotSTL, an efficient and accurate algorithm that can
decompose time series online with an update time complexity of O(1). OneShotSTL
is more than $1,000$ times faster than the batch methods, with accuracy
comparable to the best counterparts. Extensive experiments on real-world
benchmark datasets for downstream time series anomaly detection and forecasting
tasks demonstrate that OneShotSTL is from 10 to over 1,000 times faster than
the state-of-the-art methods, while still providing comparable or even better
accuracy.

graph pre-training (SGP) paradigm due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
However, existing efforts perform the mask-then-reconstruct operation in the
raw data space as is done in computer vision (CV) and natural language
processing (NLP) areas, while neglecting the important non-Euclidean property
of graph data. As a result, the highly unstable local connection structures
largely increase the uncertainty in inferring masked data and decrease the
reliability of the exploited self-supervision signals, leading to inferior
representations for downstream evaluations. To address this issue, we propose a
novel SGP method termed Robust mAsked gRaph autoEncoder (RARE) to improve the
certainty in inferring masked data and the reliability of the self-supervision
mechanism by further masking and reconstructing node samples in the high-order
latent feature space. Through both theoretical and empirical analyses, we have
discovered that performing a joint mask-then-reconstruct strategy in both
latent feature and raw data spaces could yield improved stability and
performance. To this end, we elaborately design a masked latent feature
completion scheme, which predicts latent features of masked nodes under the
guidance of high-order sample correlations that are hard to be observed from
the raw data perspective. Specifically, we first adopt a latent feature
predictor to predict the masked latent features from the visible ones. Next, we
encode the raw data of masked samples with a momentum graph encoder and
subsequently employ the resulting representations to improve predicted results
through latent feature matching. Extensive experiments on seventeen datasets
have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of RARE against
state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitors across three downstream tasks.

there is an increasing need for deploying these systems in real-world
scenarios. However, recent research has revealed that deep neural networks for
skin lesion recognition may overly depend on disease-irrelevant image artifacts
(i.e. dark corners, dense hairs), leading to poor generalization in unseen
environments. To address this issue, we propose a novel domain generalization
method called EPVT, which involves embedding prompts into the vision
transformer to collaboratively learn knowledge from diverse domains.
Concretely, EPVT leverages a set of domain prompts, each of which plays as a
domain expert, to capture domain-specific knowledge; and a shared prompt for
general knowledge over the entire dataset. To facilitate knowledge sharing and
the interaction of different prompts, we introduce a domain prompt generator
that enables low-rank multiplicative updates between domain prompts and the
shared prompt. A domain mixup strategy is additionally devised to reduce the
co-occurring artifacts in each domain, which allows for more flexible decision
margins and mitigates the issue of incorrectly assigned domain labels.
Experiments on four out-of-distribution datasets and six different biased ISIC
datasets demonstrate the superior generalization ability of EPVT in skin lesion
recognition across various environments. Our code and dataset will be released

UAV that works as a fusion center (FCUAV) and multiple subordinate UAVs (SU).
All UAVs fly at the fixed height. FCUAV integrates the sensing data of network
and carries out downward-looking detection. SUs carry out downward-looking
detection and transmit the sensing data to FCUAV. To achieve the beam sharing
scheme, each UAV is equipped with a novel JSC antenna array that is composed of
both the sensing subarray (SenA) and the communication subarray (ComA) in order
to generate the sensing beam (SenB) and the communication beam (ComB) for
detection and communication, respectively. SenB and ComB of each UAV share a
total amount of radio power. Because of the spatial orthogonality of
communication and sensing, SenB and ComB can be easily formed orthogonally. The
upper bound of average cooperative sensing area (UB-ACSA) is defined as the
metric to measure the sensing performance, which is related to the mutual
sensing interference and the communication capacity. Numerical simulations
prove the validity of the theoretical expressions for UB-ACSA of the network.
The optimal number of UAVs and the optimal SenB power are identified under the

Handling concept drift in forecasting is essential for many ML methods in use

registration generally formulates the outlier removal as an inlier/outlier
classification problem. The core for this to be successful is to learn the
discriminative inlier/outlier feature representations. In this paper, we
develop a novel variational non-local network-based outlier rejection framework
for robust alignment. By reformulating the non-local feature learning with
variational Bayesian inference, the Bayesian-driven long-range dependencies can
be modeled to aggregate discriminative geometric context information for
inlier/outlier distinction. Specifically, to achieve such Bayesian-driven
contextual dependencies, each query/key/value component in our non-local
network predicts a prior feature distribution and a posterior one. Embedded
with the inlier/outlier label, the posterior feature distribution is
label-dependent and discriminative. Thus, pushing the prior to be close to the
discriminative posterior in the training step enables the features sampled from
this prior at test time to model high-quality long-range dependencies. Notably,
to achieve effective posterior feature guidance, a specific probabilistic
graphical model is designed over our non-local model, which lets us derive a
variational low bound as our optimization objective for model training.
Finally, we propose a voting-based inlier searching strategy to cluster the
high-quality hypothetical inliers for transformation estimation. Extensive
experiments on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets verify the effectiveness
of our method.

adversaries with infinite power: they can return any real number each time they
are queried for a sample. For such an adversarial setting, we propose the first
asynchronous online algorithm that converges to $\mu$ almost surely. We prove
this result using a novel differential inclusion based two-timescale analysis.
Two key highlights of our proof include: (a) the use of a novel Lyapunov
function for showing that $\mu$ is the unique global attractor for our
algorithm's limiting dynamics, and (b) the use of martingale and stopping time
theory to show that our algorithm's iterates are almost surely bounded.

a pair of $Z$ bosons, with contributions from both the production and

nuclear-matter parameter characterizing the low-mass NS. Conclusions: The
NS-observation-inspired EDF offers a reasonable reproduction of the structures
of finite nuclei. A future global optimization including more nuclear data will
give better accuracy and high predictive power of neutron-rich nuclei.

semilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), written in a strict
feedforward form. The diffusion coefficients are considered distinct and the
PDEs are interconnected via both a reaction matrix and a nonlinearity. Only one
of the PDEs is assumed to be controlled internally, thereby leading to an
underactuated system. Constructive and efficient control of such underactuated
systems is a nontrivial open problem, which has been solved recently for the
linear case. In this work, these results are extended to the semilinear case,
which is highly challenging due the interconnection that is introduced by the
nonlinearity. Modal decomposition is employed, where due to nonlinearity, the
finite-dimensional part of the solution is coupled with the
infinite-dimensional tail. A transformation is then performed to map the
finite-dimensional part into a target system, which allows for an efficient
design of a static linear proportional state-feedback controller. Furthermore,
a high-gain approach is employed in order to compensate for the nonlilinear
terms. Lyapunov stability analysis is performed, leading to LMI conditions
guaranteeing exponential stability with arbitrary decay rate. The LMIs are
shown to always be feasible, provided the number of actuators and the value of
the high gain parameter are large enough. Numerical examples show the
efficiency of the proposed approach.

significant implications for human health. With the development of deep
learning, numerous ECG classification algorithms based on deep learning have
emerged. However, most existing algorithms trade off high accuracy for complex
models, resulting in high storage usage and power consumption. This also
inevitably increases the difficulty of implementation on wearable Artificial
Intelligence-of-Things (AIoT) devices with limited resources. In this study, we
proposed a universally applicable ultra-lightweight binary neural network(BNN)
that is capable of 5-class and 17-class arrhythmia classification based on ECG
signals. Our BNN achieves 96.90% (full precision 97.09%) and 97.50% (full
precision 98.00%) accuracy for 5-class and 17-class classification,
respectively, with state-of-the-art storage usage (3.76 KB and 4.45 KB).
Compared to other binarization works, our approach excels in supporting two
multi-classification modes while achieving the smallest known storage space.
Moreover, our model achieves optimal accuracy in 17-class classification and
boasts an elegantly simple network architecture. The algorithm we use is
optimized specifically for hardware implementation. Our research showcases the
potential of lightweight deep learning models in the healthcare industry,

Existing methods typically use deep learning to capture the intra-dependencies

unsolved, for instance, sparse zero-inflated data due to urban anomalies
occurring with low frequency (which can lead to poor performance on real-world

spatial, temporal, and semantic dimensions. Moreover, a unified approach to
predict multiple kinds of anomaly is left to explore. In this paper, we propose
STS to jointly capture the intra- and inter-dependencies between the patterns
and the influential factors in three dimensions. Further, we use a multi-task
prediction module with a customized loss function to solve the zero-inflated

characterization of red-giant host stars and their planetary systems. Here, we
conduct detailed asteroseismic modeling of the evolved red-giant branch (RGB)
hosts KOI-3886 and $\iota$ Draconis, making use of end-of-mission Kepler
(KOI-3886) and multi-sector TESS ($\iota$ Draconis) time-series photometry. We
also model the benchmark star KIC 8410637, a member of an eclipsing binary,
thus providing a direct test to the seismic determination. We test the impact
of adopting different sets of observed modes as seismic constraints. Inclusion
of $\ell=1$ and 2 modes improves the precision on the stellar parameters,
albeit marginally, compared to adopting radial modes alone, with $1.9$-$3.0\%$
(radius), $5$-$9\%$ (mass), and $19$-$25\%$ (age) reached when using all
p-dominated modes as constraints. Given the very small spacing of adjacent
dipole mixed modes in evolved RGB stars, the sparse set of observed g-dominated
modes is not able to provide extra constraints, further leading to highly
multimodal posteriors. Access to multi-year time-series photometry does not
improve matters, with detailed modeling of evolved RGB stars based on
(lower-resolution) TESS data sets attaining a precision commensurate with that
based on end-of-mission Kepler data. Furthermore, we test the impact of varying
the atmospheric boundary condition in our stellar models. We find mass and
radius estimates to be insensitive to the description of the near-surface
layers, at the expense of substantially changing both the near-surface
structure of the best-fitting models and the values of associated parameters
like the initial helium abundance, $Y_{\rm i}$. Attempts to measure $Y_{\rm i}$
from seismic modeling of red giants may thus be systematically dependent on the
choice of atmospheric physics.

evolution of the matter overdensity for energy-momentum-squared gravity (EMSG)

cosmological constant, is a nonlinear matter extension of the general theory of
relativity and includes modification terms dominating in the high energy
regimes i.e., early universe. Considering the Friedman-Robertson-Walker (FRW)
background in the presence of a cosmological constant, we find the effects of
the modifications arising from EMSG on the growth of perturbations at the early
stages of the universe. By taking into account both possible negative, and
positive values of the model parameter of EMSG, we discuss its role in the
evolution of the matter density contrast and growth function in the level of
linear perturbations. While EMSG leaves imprints distinguishable from
\LambdaCDM, we find that the negative range of the ESMG model parameter is not
well-behaved indicating an anomaly in the parameter space of the model. In this
regard, for the evaluation of the galaxy cluster number count in the framework
of EMSG, we equivalently provide an analysis of the number count of the
gravitationally collapsed objects (or the dark matter halos). We show that the
galaxy cluster number count decreases compared to the \LambdaCDM model. In
agreement with the hierarchical model of structure formation, in EMSG cosmology
also the more massive structures are less abundant, meaning that form at later
times.

analogously to how classical random walks can be models for classical
thermalization. In a quantum walk over a graph, a walker moves in a
superposition of node positions via a unitary time evolution. We show a quantum
walk can be interpreted as an equilibration of a kind investigated in the
literature on thermalization in unitarily evolving quantum systems. This
connection implies that recent results concerning the equilibration of
observables can be applied to analyse the node position statistics of quantum
walks. We illustrate this in the case of a family of graphs known as
fullerenes. We find that a bound from Short et al., implying that certain
expectation values will at most times be close to their time-averaged value,
applies tightly to the node position probabilities. Nevertheless, the node
position statistics do not thermalize in the standard sense. In particular,
quantum walks over fullerene Graphs constitute a counter-example to the
hypothesis that subsystems equilibrate to the Gibbs state. We also show how
quantum walks can be used to probe the universality of the ETH relation. We
find that in C60 the relation does not hold for node position projectors, but
it does hold for the average position. The results create a concrete bridge
between the study of self-thermalization of quantum systems and that of quantum
computation via quantum walks.

complexity of the surrounding environment pose challenges for developing robust

comprises three encoding paths, an attention block, and a decoder block,
facilitating the integration of three types of inputs: CT slice patches,
forward and backward maximum intensity projection (MIP) images, and region of
interest (ROI) masks encompassing the nodule. By employing a novel adaptive
hard attention mechanism, MESAHA-Net iteratively performs slice-by-slice 2D
segmentation of lung nodules, focusing on the nodule region in each slice to
generate 3D volumetric segmentation of lung nodules. The proposed framework has
been comprehensively evaluated on the LIDC-IDRI dataset, the largest publicly

our approach is highly robust for various lung nodule types, outperforming
previous state-of-the-art techniques in terms of segmentation accuracy and

the second mode, the system validates a user's identity claim by comparing the
fresh provided template with the enrolled template. The biometric
transformation schemes usually produce binary templates that are better handled
by cryptographic schemes, and the comparison is based on a distance that leaks
information about the similarities between two biometric templates. Both the
experimentally determined false match rate and false non-match rate through
recognition threshold adjustment define the recognition accuracy, and hence the
security of the system. To the best of our knowledge, few works provide a
formal treatment of the security under minimum leakage of information, i.e.,
the binary outcome of a comparison with a threshold. In this paper, we rely on
probabilistic modelling to quantify the security strength of binary templates.
We investigate the influence of template size, database size and threshold on
the probability of having a near-collision. We highlight several untargeted

quantum computers work based on the quantum circuit model of computation, and
the general mapping from one model to the other is still an open problem. In
this work we provide a matrix analysis of the unitary evolution operator of
UC-DTQW, which is composed at the time of two unitary operators: the shift and
coin operators. We conceive the shift operator of the system as the unitary
matrix form of the adjacency matrix associated to the graph on which the
UC-DTQW takes place, and provide a set of equations to transform the latter
into the former and vice-versa. However, this mapping modifies the structure of
the original graph into a directed multigraph, by splitting single edges or
arcs of the original graph into multiple arcs. Thus, the fact that any unitary
operator has a quantum circuit representation means that any adjacency matrix
that complies with the transformation equations will be automatically
associated to a quantum circuit, and any quantum circuit acting on a bipartite
system will be always associated to a multigraph. Finally, we extend the
definition of the coin operator to a superposition of coins in such a way that
each coin acts on different vertices of the multigraph on which the quantum

with increasing matter density, up to about $10^{10}$ K. At such high
temperatures and beyond, the crustal ions are put into collective motion and
the associated entropy contribution can affect both the thermodynamic
properties and the composition of matter. We studied the importance of this
effect in different thermodynamic conditions relevant to the inner crust of the
proto-neutron star, both at beta equilibrium and in the fixed-proton-fraction
regime. To this aim, we solved the hydrodynamic equations for an ion moving in
an incompressible, irrotational, and non-viscous fluid, with different boundary
conditions, thus leading to different prescriptions for the ion effective mass.
We then employed a compressible liquid-drop approach in the one-component
plasma approximation, including the renormalisation of the ion mass to account
for the influence of the surrounding medium. We show that the cluster size is
determined by the competition between the ion centre-of-mass motion and the
interface properties, namely the Coulomb, surface, and curvature energies. In
particular, including the translational free energy in the minimisation
procedure can significantly reduce the optimal number of nucleons in the
clusters and lead to an early dissolution of clusters in dense
beta-equilibrated matter. On the other hand, we find that the impact of
translational motion is reduced in scenarios where the proton fraction is
assumed constant and is almost negligible on the inner-crust equation of state.
Our results show that the translational degrees of freedom affect the
equilibrium composition of beta-equilibrated matter and the density and
pressure of the crust-core transition in a non-negligible way, highlighting the

The colloidal synthesis and characterization of gold selenide nanoparticles are

characterization is done using an X-ray diffraction pattern. The coexistence of
the {\alpha}- and {\beta}-AuSe phases is observed in all synthesized samples.
The morphologies of the mainly {\alpha}-AuSe sample are nanobelts, whereas the
primarily {\beta}-AuSe phase sample has a nanoplate-like structure, according
to the TEM and SEM data. All of the samples had Raman vibrational modes with
mixed phases. The effect of high pressure on as-prepared AuSe samples has been
studied in this work. The introduction of external pressure and temperature
allows both phases to transition. Pressure lowers the existence of other phase
modes, and the corresponding dominating sample modes are entirely significant
in our sample. The phase transition pressure was observed using Raman
scattering. Our findings show that 2D AuSe has a lot of promise for
multifunctional applications, encouraging more research on these systems.

building different predictors based on traffic categories, so that different
types of classified traffic can use more appropriate predictors for traffic
prediction according to their categories. Secondly, the prediction results of

components, are often sensitive to noise and out-of-distribution (OOD)
instances encountered during runtime. As such, safety critical tasks depend
upon OOD detection subsystems in order to restore the CPS to a known state or
interrupt execution to prevent safety from being compromised. However, it is
difficult to guarantee the performance of OOD detectors as it is difficult to
characterize the OOD aspect of an instance, especially in high-dimensional
unstructured data.
  To distinguish between OOD data and data known to the learning component
through the training process, an emerging technique is to incorporate
variational autoencoders (VAE) within systems and apply classification or
anomaly detection techniques on their latent spaces. The rationale for doing so
is the reduction of the data domain size through the encoding process, which
benefits real-time systems through decreased processing requirements,
facilitates feature analysis for unstructured data and allows more explainable
techniques to be implemented.
  This study places probably approximately correct (PAC) based guarantees on
OOD detection using the encoding process within VAEs to quantify image features
and apply conformal constraints over them. This is used to bound the detection
error on unfamiliar instances with user-defined confidence. The approach used
in this study is to empirically establish these bounds by sampling the latent
probability distribution and evaluating the error with respect to the
constraint violations that are encountered. The guarantee is then verified
using data generated from CARLA, an open-source driving simulator.

remains enigmatic owing to an incomplete understanding of their collective
dynamics. We investigate a paradigmatic suspension of phoretic swimmers
represented by isotropic phoretic disks. By varying the activity and area
fraction of disks, we observe their diverse collective phenomena: formation of
crystalline solids resembling Wigner crystals, melting, gas-like dynamic
chaining, active transition and turbulence. Notably, altering the activity
alone leads to solid-fluid phase transition and subsequently the fluid's
laminar-turbulent transition. Our observations are based on large-scale
simulations explicitly resolving the many-body, long-range hydrochemical
interactions among the phoretic agents. We reproduce independent experimental
phenomena that have not been collectively captured by a single model,
emphasizing the importance of incorporating full physicochemical hydrodynamics.
We develop a predictive scaling delineating the solid-liquid transition and
further dissect it as a defect-mediated two-step melting scenario via a hexatic
phase. We demonstrate that the fluid phase exhibits oscillatory instability
with waves, transition due to wave-breaking clusters, and active turbulence
manifesting vortices. These progressive scenarios evidence a closer
phenomenological resemblance between active and classical fluids in their
laminar-turbulent transition than previously demonstrated. Our findings
elucidate the collective dynamics of phoretic agents, potentially facilitating
the design of active material systems by harnessing non-equilibrium phoretic

spatial correlation. Furthermore, we propose a novel self-supervised image
denoising method that combines the multi-mask strategy with BSN (MM-BSN). We
show that different masks can cause significant performance differences, and
the proposed MM-BSN can efficiently fuse the features extracted by multi-masked
layers, while recovering the texture structures destroyed by multi-masking and
information transmission. Our MM-BSN can be used to address the problem of
large-noise denoising, which cannot be efficiently handled by other BSN
methods. Extensive experiments on public real-world datasets demonstrate that
the proposed MM-BSN achieves state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised

independently, scene text naturally links text and visual modalities together
by conveying linguistic semantics while being a visual object in an image
simultaneously. Different to conventional STVQA models which take the
linguistic semantics and visual semantics in scene text as two separate
features, in this paper, we propose a paradigm of ""Locate Then Generate"" (LTG),
which explicitly unifies this two semantics with the spatial bounding box as a
bridge connecting them. Specifically, at first, LTG locates the region in an
image that may contain the answer words with an answer location module (ALM)
consisting of a region proposal network and a language refinement network, both
of which can transform to each other with one-to-one mapping via the scene text
bounding box. Next, given the answer words selected by ALM, LTG generates a
readable answer sequence with an answer generation module (AGM) based on a
pre-trained language model. As a benefit of the explicit alignment of the
visual and linguistic semantics, even without any scene text based pre-training
tasks, LTG can boost the absolute accuracy by +6.06% and +6.92% on the TextVQA
dataset and the ST-VQA dataset respectively, compared with a non-pre-training

whether the CDW in FeGe is driven by its electronic correlation and magnetism.
Here, we address this problem using density functional theory and its
combination with $U$ as well as dynamical mean-field theory. Our calculations
show that large dimerization ($\sim 1.3 \overset{\lower.5em\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$)
of Ge1-sites along $c$-axis will enhance electronic correlation of the Fe-$3d$
orbitals and, as a result, it enhances the spin-polarization and saves more
magnetic exchange energies. We find that the balance between magnetic energy
saving and structural energy cost via partially dimerizing Ge1-sites in an
enlarged superstructure, could induce a new local minimum in total energies.
The response to the large partial Ge1-dimerization will induce additional small
modulations ($<0.05 \overset{\lower.5em\circ}{\mathrm{A}}$) of other sites in
the Kagome and honeycomb layers, which further reduces the total energy and
leads to a stable $2\times 2\times 2$ CDW ground state in FeGe. Our results are
in good agreement with the existing experiments and reveal a novel CDW
mechanism driven by the interplay of structure, electronic correlation and

properties are closely linked to those of photospheric p-modes. However, it is
still unclear how a predominantly acoustic wave driver can produce these
transverse oscillations in the magnetically dominated solar corona. In this
study we conduct a 3D ideal MHD numerical simulation to model a straight,
expanding coronal loop in a gravitationally stratified solar atmosphere which
includes a transition region and chromosphere. We implement a driver locally at
one foot-point corresponding to an acoustic-gravity wave which is inclined by
$\theta = 15^{\circ}$ with respect to the vertical axis of the magnetic
structure and is similar to a vertical driver incident on an inclined loop. We
show that transverse motions are produced in the magnetic loop, which displace
the axis of the waveguide due to the breaking of azimuthal symmetry, and study
the resulting modes in the theoretical framework of a magnetic cylinder model.
By conducting an azimuthal Fourier analysis of the perturbed velocity signals,
the contribution from different cylindrical modes is obtained. Furthermore, the
perturbed vorticity is computed to demonstrate how the transverse motions
manifest themselves throughout the whole non-uniform space. Finally we present
some physical properties of the Alfv\'enic perturbations and present transverse
motions with velocity amplitudes in the range of $0.2-0.75$ km s$^{-1}$ which
exhibit two distinct oscillation regimes corresponding to $42$ s and $364$ s,
where the latter value is close to the period of the p-mode driver in the
simulation.

demanding Eddington-Finkelstein (EF) conditions at the horizon. This leads to
certain logarithmic fall-offs that are too slow along null directions at
$\mathscr{I}$, resulting in divergences in the covariant surface charges. These
coordinates are therefore $not$ asymptotically flat. In this paper, we find a
natural alternative double null form for Schwarzschild that is adapted to
$\mathscr{I}^{+}$ or $\mathscr{I}^{-}$ instead of the horizon. In its final
form, the metric has only power law fall-offs and fits into the recently
introduced Special Double Null (SDN) gauge, with finite surface charges. One
remarkable feature of SDN gauge is that spherical symmetry and vacuum Einstein
equations allow an infinite number of asymptotic integration constants in the
metric, on top of the mass. This is an apparent violation of Birkhoff's
theorem. We note however that all except two of these new parameters are absent
in the charges, and therefore correspond to trivial hair. The remaining two
parameters do show up in the charges, depending on the choice of allowed
fall-offs. We provide an understanding of this observation -- Birkhoff's
theorem fixes Schwarzschild only $up$ $to$ $diffeomorphisms$, but
diffeomorphisms need not vanish at infinity and can in principle become global
symmetries. If such asymptotic diffeomorphisms are spherically symmetric, their
associated soft modes can become Birkhoff hair. The relevant global symmetries
here are certain hypertranslation shifts in the $v$-coordinate at
$\mathscr{I}^{+}$ (and $u$ at $\mathscr{I}^{-}$), which are inaccessible in
other gauges.

existing bounds decay exponentially with the ambient dimension (for spherical

bounded-degree high dimensional expanders). Our results are based on several
new techniques:
  * We develop a new ""color-restriction"" technique which enables proving
dimension-free expansion by restricting a multi-partite complex to small random
subsets of its color classes.
  * We give a new ""spectral"" proof for Evra and Kaufman's local-to-global

understand clinic-relevant information carried by medical images. The questions
to a medical image include two categories: close-end (such as Yes/No question)
and open-end. To obtain answers, the majority of the existing medical VQA
methods relies on classification approaches, while a few works attempt to use
generation approaches or a mixture of the two. The classification approaches
are relatively simple but perform poorly on long open-end questions. To bridge
this gap, in this paper, we propose a new Transformer based framework for
medical VQA (named as Q2ATransformer), which integrates the advantages of both
the classification and the generation approaches and provides a unified
treatment for the close-end and open-end questions. Specifically, we introduce
an additional Transformer decoder with a set of learnable candidate answer
embeddings to query the existence of each answer class to a given
image-question pair. Through the Transformer attention, the candidate answer
embeddings interact with the fused features of the image-question pair to make
the decision. In this way, despite being a classification-based approach, our
method provides a mechanism to interact with the answer information for
prediction like the generation-based approaches. On the other hand, by
classification, we mitigate the task difficulty by reducing the search space of
answers. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two medical
VQA benchmarks. Especially, for the open-end questions, we achieve 79.19% on

study nonlinear, thermoelectric transport across an asymmetric energy barrier
epitaxially defined in a single semiconductor nanowire. We find in both

upper and lower branches. The proposed DCBDNet was evaluated on several
synthetic and real-world image denoising benchmark datasets. Experimental

makes important progress as it yields the first nontrivial $\tilde{O}(n)$ ratio

obtain this via an $\tilde{O}(nk + n^{1.5})$ query complexity algorithm for the

suitable for computations of dynamic correlation. Several approaches to include
that in post-DMRG methods exist; in our group we focused on the tailored-CC
(TCC) approach. This method works well in many situations, however, in exactly
degenerate cases (with two or more determinants of equal weight), it exhibits a
bias towards the reference determinant representing the Fermi vacuum. Although
in some cases it is possible to use a compensation scheme to avoid this bias
for energy differences, as we did in a previous work on the singlet-triplet gap
in the tetramethylenethane (TME) molecule, it is certainly a drawback.
  In order to overcome the single-reference bias of the TCC method, we have
developed a Hilbert-space multireference version of tailored CC, which can
treat several determinants on an equal footing. We have employed a
multireference analysis of the DMRG wave function in the matrix product state
form to get the active amplitudes for each reference determinant and their
constant contribution to the effective Hamiltonian. We have implemented and
compared the performance of three Hilbert-space MRCC variants - the state
universal one, and the Brillouin-Wigner and Mukherjee's state specific ones. We
have assessed these approaches on the cyclobutadiene and tetramethylenethane
(TME) molecules, which are both diradicals with exactly degenerate determinants
at a certain geometry. Two DMRG active spaces have been selected based on
orbital entropies, while the MRCC active space comprised the HOMO and LUMO
orbitals needed for description of the diradical. We have also investigated the
sensitivity of the results on orbital rotation of the HOMO-LUMO pair, as it is
well known that Hilbert-space MRCC methods are not invariant to such
transformations.

denoising to a new level. Among them, self-supervised denoising is increasingly
popular because it does not require any prior knowledge. Most of the existing
self-supervised methods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), which
are restricted by the locality of the receptive field and would cause color
shifts or textures loss. In this paper, we propose a novel Denoise Transformer
for real-world image denoising, which is mainly constructed with Context-aware
Denoise Transformer (CADT) units and Secondary Noise Extractor (SNE) block.
CADT is designed as a dual-branch structure, where the global branch uses a
window-based Transformer encoder to extract the global information, while the
local branch focuses on the extraction of local features with small receptive
field. By incorporating CADT as basic components, we build a hierarchical
network to directly learn the noise distribution information through residual
learning and obtain the first stage denoised output. Then, we design SNE in low
computation for secondary global noise extraction. Finally the blind spots are
collected from the Denoise Transformer output and reconstructed, forming the
final denoised image. Extensive experiments on the real-world SIDD benchmark
achieve 50.62/0.990 for PSNR/SSIM, which is competitive with the current
state-of-the-art method and only 0.17/0.001 lower. Visual comparisons on public
sRGB, Raw-RGB and greyscale datasets prove that our proposed Denoise
Transformer has a competitive performance, especially on blurred textures and
low-light images, without using additional knowledge, e.g., noise level or

gait patterns. The use of biometric data permits an individuation so exact that
the data is utilized effectively in identification and authentication systems.
But for this same reason, privacy protections become indispensably necessary.
  Privacy protection is extensively afforded by the technique of anonymization.
Anonymization techniques obfuscate or remove the sensitive personal data to
achieve high levels of anonymity. However, the effectiveness of anonymization
relies, in equal parts, on the effectiveness of the methods employed to
evaluate anonymization performance.
  In this paper, we assess the state-of-the-art methods used to evaluate the
performance of anonymization techniques for facial images and gait patterns. We
demonstrate that the state-of-the-art evaluation methods have serious and
frequent shortcomings. In particular, we find that the underlying assumptions
of the state-of-the-art are quite unwarranted. When a method evaluating the
performance of anonymization assumes a weak adversary or a weak recognition
scenario, then the resulting evaluation will very likely be a gross
overestimation of the anonymization performance. Therefore, we propose a
stronger adversary model which is alert to the recognition scenario as well as
to the anonymization scenario. Our adversary model implements an appropriate
measure of anonymization performance. We improve the selection process for the
evaluation dataset, and we reduce the numbers of identities contained in the
dataset while ensuring that these identities remain easily distinguishable from
one another. Our novel evaluation methodology surpasses the state-of-the-art
because we measure worst-case performance and so deliver a highly reliable
evaluation of biometric anonymization techniques.

of the teacher network are adopted as supervisors of the student segmentation

distinctly where the convolution layers should pay visual attention into. The
proposed method is named as Label-guided Attention Distillation (LGAD). It
turns out that the student network learns significantly better with LGAD than

method do not increase the inference time. Note that LGAD can be easily

solving a standard MPC optimization problem followed by a predictive safety

generation of architectural layouts, a constrained optimization task,
leveraging QD through a two-archive approach. Results show that while global

we demonstrate that such motility can occur even in active fluids without any
preexisting order. The emergence of object motility is characterized by both
continuous and discontinuous transitions associated with the symmetry-breaking
bifurcation of the object's steady-state velocity. Furthermore, we also discuss
the relevance of the transitions to the nonmonotonic particle-size dependence
of the object's diffusion coefficient.

operation constraints that depend on each agent's behavior must be met. Drawing
our motivation from mobile robot swarms, in this paper, we address this problem
by optimizing individual agent performance while guaranteeing persistent
constraint satisfaction in presence of bounded communication range and
time-varying network topology. The approach we propose is a model predictive
control (MPC) formulation, building on multi-trajectory MPC (mt-MPC) concepts.
To enable plug and play operations when the system is in closed-loop without
the need of a request, the proposed MPC scheme predicts two different state
trajectories in the same finite horizon optimal control problem. One trajectory
drives the system to the desired target, assuming that the network topology
will not change in the prediction horizon, while the second one ensures
constraint satisfaction assuming a worst-case scenario in terms of new agents
joining the network in the planning horizon. Recursive feasibility and
stability of the closed-loop system during plug and play operations are shown.
The approach effectiveness is illustrated with a numerical simulation.

cathodes for advanced Li-ion batteries, represent a complex chemical and
configurational space for conventional density functional theory (DFT)-based
high-throughput screening approaches. Notably, atom-centered machine-learned
interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are a promising pathway to accurately model the
potential energy surface of highly-disordered systems, such as LDRs, where the
performance of such MLIPs have not been rigorously explored yet. Here, we
represent a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy, transferability, and ease
of training of five MLIPs in modelling LDRs, including artificial neural
network potential developed by the atomic energy network (AENET), Gaussian
approximation potential (GAP), spectral neighbor analysis potential (SNAP) and
its quadratic extension (qSNAP), and moment tensor potential (MTP).
Specifically, we generate a DFT-calculated dataset of 10842 disordered
LiTMO$_2$ and TMO$_2$ configurations, where TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,
and/or Cu. Importantly, we find AENET to be the best in terms of accuracy and
transferability for energy predictions, while MTP is the best for atomic
forces. While AENET is the fastest to train at low number of epochs, the
training time increases significantly as epochs increase, with a corresponding
reduction in training errors. Note that AENET and GAP tend to overfit in small
datasets, with the extent of overfitting reducing with larger datasets.
Finally, we observe AENET to provide reasonable predictions of average
Li-intercalation voltages in layered, single-TM LiTMO$_2$ frameworks, compared
to DFT ($\sim$10% error on average). Our study should pave the way both for
discovering novel LDR electrodes and for modelling other configurationally
complex systems, such as high-entropy ceramics and alloys.

subsequence anomalies, the discord concept is considered one of the best. A
time series discord is intuitively defined as a subsequence of a given length

introduced the MERLIN algorithm discovers time series discords of every

handle the multiple usages/meanings of the words and better capture the related
semantic shifts. In this paper, we survey the approaches based on
contextualised embeddings for SSD (i.e., CSSDetection) and we propose a
classification framework characterised by meaning representation,
time-awareness, and learning modality dimensions. The framework is exploited i)
to review the measures for shift assessment, ii) to compare the approaches on
performance, and iii) to discuss the current issues in terms of scalability,
interpretability, and robustness. Open challenges and future research

proposed to improve the attack performance. In this work, we revisit MI, study
two fundamental issues pertaining to all state-of-the-art (SOTA) MI algorithms,
and propose solutions to these issues which lead to a significant boost in
attack performance for all SOTA MI. In particular, our contributions are
two-fold: 1) We analyze the optimization objective of SOTA MI algorithms, argue
that the objective is sub-optimal for achieving MI, and propose an improved
optimization objective that boosts attack performance significantly. 2) We
analyze ""MI overfitting"", show that it would prevent reconstructed images from
learning semantics of training data, and propose a novel ""model augmentation""
idea to overcome this issue. Our proposed solutions are simple and improve all
SOTA MI attack accuracy significantly. E.g., in the standard CelebA benchmark,
our solutions improve accuracy by 11.8% and achieve for the first time over 90%

Gravity enhances the growth of density perturbations, which then collapse and

dust asymmetries associated with these vortices can be long-lived enough that
they should be much more common in mm/sub-mm observations of protoplanetary
discs, even though they are quite rare. Observed asymmetries also have a range
of azimuthal extents from compact to elongated even though computational
studies have shown planet-induced vortices should be preferentially elongated.
In this study, we use 2-D and 3-D hydrodynamic simulations to test whether
those dust asymmetries should really be so long-lived or so elongated. With
higher resolution (29 cells per scale height) than our previous work, we find
that vortices can be more compact by developing compact cores when higher-mass
planets cause them to re-form, or if they are seeded by tiny compact vortices
from the vertical shear instability (VSI), but not through dust feedback in 3-D
as was previously expected in general. Any case with a compact vortex or
core(s) also has a longer lifetime. Even elongated vortices can have longer
lifetimes with higher-mass planets or if the associated planet is allowed to
migrate, the latter of which can cause the dust asymmetry to stop decaying as
the planet migrates away from the vortex. These longer dust asymmetry lifetimes
are even more inconsistent with observations, perhaps suggesting that discs
still have an intermediate amount of effective viscosity.

plays a critical role. However, there is no consensus on the definition of
observer in these theories. Following Einstein's thought experiments, one could
ask: What would it look like to sit inside a photon or to be a photon? And what
type of observer could represent this more global perspective of the photon's
interior? To address these questions, we introduce the concepts of internal and
external observers with a focus on their relationship in quantum theory and
relativity theory. The internal observer, associated with the internal
observables super-algebra, glues the external interactions.
  Drawing inspiration from the advancements in abstract algebraic topology, we
propose mathematical representation of the internal observer. We also outline
principles for ensuring the consistency of observers in terms of information
theory. It becomes evident, through the analysis of the introduced hierarchy of
observers, that entanglement is a primitive of space-time causal relationships.
While external observers must abide by the relativistic causality linked with
the no-signaling principle in quantum mechanics, the internal observer is
inherently non-local and may be acausal. However, its consistency is maintained
through the formulation of the self-consistency principle.
  One of the goals of this paper is to construct the representation of the
internal observer from the local external algebra of observables, which can be
associated with external observers. Additionally, we demonstrate how the
concepts of internal and external observers can be applied in the fields of
quantum information theory, algebraic quantum field theory, and loop quantum
gravity. The concept of internal observer seems to be also fundamental for
further development of quantum gravity.

study, we perform a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation on a vesicle
composed of a binary mixture of neutral and anionic lipids to investigate the
lateral transport of individual lipid molecules as well as the self-assembled
lipid domains themselves upon an applied direct current (DC) electric field.
Under the potential force of the electric field, a phase-separated domain rich
in the anionic lipids emerges in the opposite direction of that of the electric
field. The subsequent reversal of the electric field induces the unidirectional
domain motion. During the domain motion, the domain size remains constant, but
a considerable amount of the anionic lipids are exchanged between the
anionic-lipid-rich domain and the neutral-lipid-rich bulk. The mean velocity
field of the lipids surrounding the domain displays a two-dimensional (2D)
source dipole. We revealed that the balance between the potential force of the
applied electric field and the quasi-2D hydrodynamic frictional force well
explains the dependence of the domain motions on the electric-field strengths.
The present results provide insight into the hierarchical dynamic responses of
self-assembled lipid domains to the applied electric field and contribute to
controlling the lateral transportation of membrane inclusions.

learning literature. The second, $\calS_n^*$, is a search criterion used for
generating lattices for approximation using truncated Fourier series. We find
that the empirical difference in error between the lattices constructed using

as it is computationally more efficient and has a proven error bound.

deblurring, which aims to recover a sequence of sharp images corresponding to a
given blurry image input. A critical issue disturbing the training of an
image-to-video model is the ambiguity of the frame ordering since both the
forward and backward sequences are plausible solutions. This paper proposes an
effective self-supervised ordering scheme that allows training high-quality
image-to-video deblurring models. Unlike previous methods that rely on
order-invariant losses, we assign an explicit order for each video sequence,
thus avoiding the order-ambiguity issue. Specifically, we map each video
sequence to a vector in a latent high-dimensional space so that there exists a
hyperplane such that for every video sequence, the vectors extracted from it
and its reversed sequence are on different sides of the hyperplane. The side of
the vectors will be used to define the order of the corresponding sequence.
Last but not least, we propose a real-image dataset for the image-to-video
deblurring problem that covers a variety of popular domains, including face,
hand, and street. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
our method. Code and data are available at

identify transcription factor binding sites (i.e., motifs) in DNA sequences to
reveal the mechanisms that regulate gene expression. However, the phenomenon of
data silos and the problem of privacy leakage have seriously hindered the
development of DNA motif discovery. On the one hand, the phenomenon of data
silos makes data collection difficult. On the other hand, the collection and
use of DNA data become complicated and difficult because DNA is sensitive
private information. In this context, how discovering DNA motifs under the
premise of ensuring privacy and security and alleviating data silos has become
a very important issue. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel method, namely
DP-FLMD, to address this problem. Note that this is the first application of
federated learning to the field of genetics research. The federated learning
technique is used to solve the problem of data silos. It has the advantage of
enabling multiple participants to train models together and providing privacy
protection services. To address the challenges of federated learning in terms
of communication costs, this paper applies a sampling method and a strategy for
reducing communication costs to DP-FLMD. In addition, differential privacy, a
privacy protection technique with rigorous mathematical proof, is also applied
to DP-FLMD. Experiments on the DNA datasets show that DP-FLMD has high mining

established at Consorzio RFX, exploiting the synergy of two test beds, SPIDER

efficient negative ion sources at relevant parameters in ITER-like conditions:
source and accelerator located in the same vacuum where the beam propagates,
immunity to electromagnetic interferences of multiple radio-frequency (RF)
antennas, avoidance of RF-induced discharges on the outside of the source.
Three years of experiments on SPIDER have addressed to the necessary design
modifications to enable full performances. The source is presently under a long
shut-down phase to incorporate learnings from the experimental campaign.
Parallelly, developments on MITICA, the full-scale prototype of the ITER NBI
featuring a 1 MV accelerator and ion neutralization, are underway including
manufacturing of in-vessel components, while power supplies and auxiliary
plants are already under final testing and commissioning. Integration,
commissioning and tests of the 1MV power supplies are essential for this

When using MLO, traffic is distributed among links using an
implementation-specific traffic-to-link allocation policy. This paper aims to
evaluate the performance of MLO, using different policies, in serving AR
applications compared to Single-Link (SL). Experimental simulations using an
event-based Wi-Fi simulator have been conducted. Our results show the general
superiority of MLO when serving AR applications. MLO achieves lower latency and
serves a higher number of AR users compared to SL with the same frequency
resources. In addition, increasing the number of links can improve the
performance of MLO. Regarding traffic-to-link allocation policies, we found
that policies can be more susceptible to channel blocking, resulting in
possible performance degradation.

for URLLC services effectively. This paper proposes an empirical mode
decomposition (EMD) based hybrid prediction method to predict the interference

used to decompose the past interference values faced by the user equipment.
Long short-term memory and auto-regressive integrated moving average methods
are used to predict the decomposed components. The final predicted interference
value is reconstructed using individual predicted values of decomposed
components. It is found that such a decomposition-based prediction method
reduces the root mean squared error of the prediction by $20 - 25\%$. The
proposed resource allocation algorithm utilizing the EMD-based interference
prediction was found to meet near-optimal allocation of resources and
correspondingly results in $2-3$ orders of magnitude lower outage compared to
state-of-the-art baseline prediction algorithm-based resource allocation.

excitations are included through the action of a set of vacuum annihilating
scattering operators that act non-trivially on certain correlated wavefunctions
and are determined via a set of local denominators involving the energy
difference between certain excited states. This often leads the theory to be
prone to intruders. In this manuscript, we show that restricting the correlated
wavefunction, on which the scattering operators act upon, to be spanned by only
the singlet paired determinants can avoid the catastrophic breakdown. For the
first time, we present two nonequivalent approaches to arrive at the working
equations, viz. the projective approach with sufficiency conditions and the

leads to a better qualitative description of the energetics in the regions of
strong correlation. With a number of pilot numerical applications, we have
demonstrated the performance of the dual-exponential scheme with both the

  and Packet Dropouts","12 Pages and 7 Figures",,,,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  A networked system often uses a shared communication network to transmit the
measurements to a remotely located estimation center. Due to the limited
bandwidth of the channel, a delay may appear while receiving the measurements.
This delay can be arbitrary step random, and packets are sometimes dropped
during transmission as it exceeds a certain permissible number. In this paper,
such measurements are modeled with the Poisson distribution, which allows the
user to determine the maximum delay the system might suffer. When the
measurement delay exceeds the permissible number, the packet dropout happens.
Based on the proposed model, we solve the problem by assuming that the prior
and posterior densities of states are Gaussian and derive the expression of the
estimated state and the error covariance. Later, relaxing the Gaussian
assumption for densities, we propose a solution with the help of the sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC) approach. The proposed SMC method divides the set of
particles into several groups, where each group supports the possibility that
the received measurement is delayed by a certain number of steps. The strength
of an individual group is determined by the probability of a measurement being
delayed with the same number of steps that the group represents. This approach
estimates the states and also assesses the amount of delay from the received
measurements. Finally, the developed estimators are implemented on two
nonlinear estimation problems, and the simulation results are compared. The
proposed SMC approach shows better results compared to the designed Gaussian
delay filters and existing particle filters with delay.

synthesizing novel views for free viewpoints given a monocular video of a
dynamic scene captured by a moving camera, mainly lies in accurately modeling
the dynamic objects of a scene using limited 2D frames, each with a varying
timestamp and viewpoint. Existing methods usually require pre-processed 2D
optical flow and depth maps by additional methods to supervise the network,
making them suffer from the inaccuracy of the pre-processed supervision and the
ambiguity when lifting the 2D information to 3D. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge in an unsupervised fashion. Specifically, we decouple the motion of
the dynamic objects into object motion and camera motion, respectively
regularized by proposed unsupervised surface consistency and patch-based
multi-view constraints. The former enforces the 3D geometric surfaces of moving
objects to be consistent over time, while the latter regularizes their
appearances to be consistent across different viewpoints. Such a fine-grained
motion formulation can alleviate the learning difficulty for the network, thus
enabling it to produce not only novel views with higher quality but also more
accurate scene flows and depth than existing methods requiring extra
supervision. We will make the code publicly available.

masses, surface densities, column densities, and volume densities than

protostellar phase. We find that ~80% of cores with virial parameter ($\alpha$)
measurements are gravitationally bound ($\alpha$< 2). We also find an
anti-correlation between the mass and the virial parameter of cores, with
massive cores having on average lower virial parameters. Protostellar cores are
more gravitationally bound than prestellar cores, with an average virial
parameter of 1.2 and 1.5, respectively. The observed non-thermal velocity
dispersion (from N$_{2}$D$^{+}$ or DCO$^{+}$) is consistent with simulations in
which turbulence is continuously injected, whereas the core-to-core velocity
dispersion is neither in agreement with driven nor decaying turbulence
simulations. We find no significant increment in the line velocity dispersion
from prestellar to protostellar cores, suggesting that dense gas within the
core traced by these deuterated molecules is not yet severely affected by
turbulence injected from outflow activity at the early evolutionary stages
traced in ASHES. The most massive cores are strongly self-gravitating and have
greater surface density, Mach number, and velocity dispersion than cores with
lower masses. Dense cores have not significant velocity shifts relative to
their low-density envelopes, suggesting that dense cores are co-moving with
their envelopes. We conclude that the observed core properties are more in line

where the system is not completely known or may differ from the assumed model.
For such a system, we consider a scenario where the measurements are
transmitted to a remote location using a common communication network and due
to which, a delay is introduced while receiving the measurements. The delay
that we consider here is random and one step maximum at a given time instant.
For such a scenario, this paper develops a robust estimator for a linear
Gaussian system by minimizing the risk sensitive error criterion that is
defined as an expectation of the accumulated exponential quadratic error. The
criteria for the stability of the risk sensitive Kalman filter (RSKF) are
derived and the results are used to study the stability of the developed
filter. Further, it is assumed that the latency probability related to delay is
not known and it is estimated by maximizing the likelihood function. Simulation
results suggest that the proposed filter shows acceptable performance under the
nominal conditions, and it performs better than the Kalman filter for randomly
delayed measurements and the RSKF in presence of both the model uncertainty and
random delays.

degree d has been determined in [1] and [2], where some extremal graphs have

count is affected by forbidding some subgraphs occurring in these extremal
graphs? In [3], the problem is solved in triangle-free graphs for $d \geq m$,
and for $d < m$ with either $Z(d) \leq m < 2d$ or $d \leq 6$, where $Z(d)$ is
approximately $5d/4$. The authors derived structural properties of
triangle-free extremal graphs, which allows us to focus on constructing small
extremal components to form an extremal graph. Based on these findings, in this
paper, we develop an integer programming formulation for constructing extremal

implementation of Orbital Branching to reduce symmetry. We also implement our
integer programming formulation so that the feasible region is restricted
iteratively. Using a combination of the two approaches, we expand the solution
into $d \leq 10$ instead of $d \leq 6$ for $m > d$. Our results endorse the

simulations predict the systems dynamics by resolving all spatiotemporal
scales, often at a cost that prevents experimentation. On the other hand,
reduced order models are fast but often limited by the linearization of the
system dynamics and the adopted heuristic closures. We propose a novel
systematic framework that bridges large scale simulations and reduced order
models to extract and forecast adaptively the effective dynamics (AdaLED) of
multiscale systems. AdaLED employs an autoencoder to identify reduced-order
representations of the system dynamics and an ensemble of probabilistic
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as the latent time-stepper. The framework
alternates between the computational solver and the surrogate, accelerating
learned dynamics while leaving yet-to-be-learned dynamics regimes to the
original solver. AdaLED continuously adapts the surrogate to the new dynamics
through online training. The transitions between the surrogate and the
computational solver are determined by monitoring the prediction accuracy and
uncertainty of the surrogate. The effectiveness of AdaLED is demonstrated on
three different systems - a Van der Pol oscillator, a 2D reaction-diffusion
equation, and a 2D Navier-Stokes flow past a cylinder for varying Reynolds
numbers (400 up to 1200), showcasing its ability to learn effective dynamics
online, detect unseen dynamics regimes, and provide net speed-ups. To the best
of our knowledge, AdaLED is the first framework that couples a surrogate model
with a computational solver to achieve online adaptive learning of effective
dynamics. It constitutes a potent tool for applications requiring many
expensive simulations.

the unique deficiency of ground vehicle benchmarks in shapes of strong
background correlation results in DNNs overfitting the clutter and being
non-robust to unfamiliar surroundings. However, the gap between fixed
background model training and varying background application remains
underexplored. Inspired by contrastive learning, this letter proposes a
solution called Contrastive Feature Alignment (CFA) aiming to learn invariant
representation for robust recognition. The proposed method contributes a mixed
clutter variants generation strategy and a new inference branch equipped with
channel-weighted mean square error (CWMSE) loss for invariant representation
learning. In specific, the generation strategy is delicately designed to better
attract clutter-sensitive deviation in feature space. The CWMSE loss is further
devised to better contrast this deviation and align the deep features activated
by the original images and corresponding clutter variants. The proposed CFA
combines both classification and CWMSE losses to train the model jointly, which
allows for the progressive learning of invariant target representation.
Extensive evaluations on the MSTAR dataset and six DNN models prove the
effectiveness of our proposal. The results demonstrated that the CFA-trained
models are capable of recognizing targets among unfamiliar surroundings that
are not included in the dataset, and are robust to varying signal-to-clutter

new types of relation among the negative flows of the KdV and mKdV hierarchies.
Contrary to the positive flows, such a ""gauge-Miura"" correspondence becomes
degenerate, namely more than one negative mKdV-type model are mapped into a
single negative KdV-type model. For instance, the sinh-Gordon model and another
negative mKdV flow are mapped into a single negative KdV flow, which then
inherits solutions of both former models. The gauge-Miura correspondence
implies a rich degeneracy regarding solutions of these hierarchies. We obtain
similar results for generalized versions of the KdV and mKdV hiearchies

the first negative mKdV flow corresponds to an affine Toda field theory with

of outperforming their classical counterparts in a wide range of computational
tasks. Several types of quantum computers already operate with more than a
hundred qubits. However, their performance is hampered by interactions with
their environments, which destroy the fragile quantum information and thereby
prevent a significant speed-up over classical devices. For these reasons, it is
now important to explore the execution of quantum algorithms on noisy quantum
processors to better understand the limitations and prospects of realizing
near-term quantum computations. To this end, we here simulate the execution of
three quantum algorithms on noisy quantum computers using matrix product states
as a special class of tensor networks. Matrix product states are characterized
by their maximum bond dimension, which limits the amount of entanglement they
can describe, and which thereby can mimic the generic loss of entanglement in a
quantum computer. We analyze the fidelity of the quantum Fourier transform,
Grover's algorithm, and the quantum counting algorithm as a function of the
bond dimension, and we map out the entanglement that is generated during the
execution of these algorithms. For all three algorithms, we find that they can
be executed with high fidelity even at a moderate loss of entanglement. We also
identify the dependence of the fidelity on the number of qubits, which is
specific to each algorithm. Our approach provides a general method for
simulating noisy quantum computers, and it can be applied to a wide range of
algorithms.

visual and language modalities have been shown to be strong few-shot learners.
Soft prompt learning is the method of choice for few-shot downstream adaption
aiming to bridge the modality gap caused by the distribution shift induced by
the new domain. While parameter-efficient, prompt learning still requires
access to the model weights and can be computationally infeasible for large
models with billions of parameters. To address these shortcomings, in this
work, we describe a black-box method for V-L few-shot adaptation that (a)
operates on pre-computed image and text features and hence works without access
to the model's weights, (b) it is orders of magnitude faster at training time,
(c) it is amenable to both supervised and unsupervised training, and (d) it can
be even used to align image and text features computed from uni-modal models.
To achieve this, we propose Linear Feature Alignment (LFA), a simple linear
approach for V-L re-alignment in the target domain. LFA is initialized from a
closed-form solution to a least-squares problem and then it is iteratively
updated by minimizing a re-ranking loss. Despite its simplicity, our approach
can even surpass soft-prompt learning methods as shown by extensive experiments
on 11 image and 2 video datasets.

unprecedented number of 839 cores, with masses between 0.05 and 81 $M_\odot$

$M_\odot$), whereas $\lesssim$1% (7/839) are high-mass ($\gtrsim$27 $M_\odot$).
We detect no high-mass prestellar cores. The most massive cores (MMC)
identified within individual clumps lack sufficient mass to form high-mass
stars without additional mass feeding. We find that the mass of the MMCs is
correlated with the clump surface density, implying denser clumps produce more
massive cores and a larger number of cores. There is no significant mass
segregation except for a few tentative detections. In contrast, most clumps
show segregation once the clump density is considered instead of mass. Although
the dust continuum emission resolves clumps in a network of filaments, some of

the analysis of disc sizes, is difficult because larger, deeper and higher

evolution based on $^{12}$CO fluxes. In fact, fluxes can be readily collected

same disc physico-chemical processes as sizes: assuming that $^{12}$CO is
optically thick, fluxes scale with the disc surface area. We developed a
semi-analytical model to compute $^{12}$CO fluxes and benchmarked it against
the results of DALI thermochemical models, recovering an agreement within a
factor of three. As a proof of concept we compared our models with Lupus and
Upper Sco data, taking advantage of the increased samples, by a factor 1.3
(Lupus) and 3.6 (Upper Sco), when studying fluxes instead of sizes. Models and
data agree well only if CO depletion is considered. However, the uncertainties

new method can be used to design future ad hoc observational strategies to

of the repeat bursts displayed radio emission in the range of 1.8--4 GHz, while
the burst emission peaked at 1.1 GHz. We discover evidence for secular trends
in the burst dispersion measure, indicating a rate of $-2.7\pm0.2\,{\rm

rotation measure of the bursts across the follow-up period, including evidence
of a sign reversal. While a majority of bursts did not exhibit any
polarization, those that did show a decrease in the linear polarization
fraction as a function of frequency, consistent with spectral depolarization
due to scattering observed in other repeating FRB sources. Surprisingly, no
significant variation in the polarization position angles was found, which is
in contrast with earlier measurements reported for the FRB source. We measure
the burst rate and sub-pulse drift rate variation and compare them with the
previous results. These novel observations, along with the extreme polarization
properties observed in other repeating FRBs, suggest that a sub-sample of FRB

relocating objects to some buffer space may be necessary. This raises the
natural question of how many simultaneous storage spaces, or ""running buffers"",
are required so that certain classes of tabletop rearrangement problems are
feasible. In this work, we examine the problem for both labeled and unlabeled
settings. On the structural side, we observe that finding the minimum number of
running buffers (MRB) can be carried out on a dependency graph abstracted from
a problem instance, and show that computing MRB is NP-hard. We then prove that
under both labeled and unlabeled settings, even for uniform cylindrical
objects, the number of required running buffers may grow unbounded as the
number of objects to be rearranged increases. We further show that the bound
for the unlabeled case is tight. On the algorithmic side, we develop effective
exact algorithms for finding MRB for both labeled and unlabeled tabletop
rearrangement problems, scalable to over a hundred objects under very high
object density. More importantly, our algorithms also compute a sequence
witnessing the computed MRB that can be used for solving object rearrangement
tasks. Employing these algorithms, empirical evaluations reveal that random
labeled and unlabeled instances, which more closely mimics real-world setups,
generally have fairly small MRBs. Using real robot experiments, we demonstrate
that the running buffer abstraction leads to state-of-the-art solutions for
in-place rearrangement of many objects in tight, bounded workspace.

appealing since they are complete. Even in crowded scenarios, they allow
finding a feasible solution that brings each agent to its target, preventing
deadlock situations. However, generally, rule-based algorithms provide
solutions that are much longer than the optimal one. The main contribution of
this paper is the introduction of an iterative local search procedure in MAPF.
We start from a feasible suboptimal solution and we perform a local search in a
neighborhood of this solution, to find a shorter one. Iteratively, we repeat
this procedure until the solution cannot be shortened any longer. At the end,
we obtain a solution, that is still sub-optimal, but, in general, of much
better quality than the initial one. We use dynamic programming for the local
search procedure. Under this respect, the fact that our search is local is
fundamental to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm. Indeed, if we apply
a standard dynamic programming the number of explored states grows
exponentially with the number of agents. As we will see, the introduction of a
locality constraint allows solving the (local) dynamic programming problem in a
time that grows only polynomially with respect to the number of agents.

In this study, we define Urban Flood Drifters (UFDs) as loose objects present
in the urban landscape that can become mobile over certain flow conditions,
thereafter blocking drainage infrastructure and endangering both downstream and
upstream communities. Based on post-flood photographic records from 63 major
inundations of the past quarter-century across 46 countries, we provide a
comprehensive analysis of UFDs and its flood-hazard implications. We show that
a variety of vehicles, furniture and a heterogeneous mixture of drifters are
present in post-flooding scenarios. Plastic, wood drifters and construction
debris represent each about 20% of the material transported in urban floods
(57.8% together), while only 11.2% corresponds to cars, which is practically
the only UFD analysed in flood literature. We develop a UFD-stability diagram,
showing that caravans, recreational vehicles (RVs) and also furniture such as
dumpsters or garden sheds, can be more relevant from a flood hazard
perspective.

the expected value core. Unfortunately, without exact knowledge of the

extremely challenging task. Hence, we propose the concept of distributionaly

Wasserstein distance, we provide finite-sample guarantees that any allocation
which lies in the DR core is also stable with respect to the true probability
distribution. Furthermore, we show that as the number of samples grows

$k$-XOR problem, given $k$ uniformly random Boolean vectors of length
$\log{M}$, the objective is to find a set of $k$ of them whose bitwise-XOR is
the all-zero vector. Both of these problems have widespread applications in the
study of fine-grained complexity and cryptanalysis.
  The feasibility and complexity of these problems depends on the relative
values of $k$, $r$, and $M$. The dense regime of $M \leq r^k$, where solutions
exist with high probability, is quite well-understood and we have several
non-trivial algorithms and hardness conjectures here. Much less is known about
the sparse regime of $M\gg r^k$, where solutions are unlikely to exist. The
best answers we have for many fundamental questions here are limited to
whatever carries over from the dense or worst-case settings.
  We study the planted $k$-SUM and $k$-XOR problems in the sparse regime. In
these problems, a random solution is planted in a randomly generated instance
and has to be recovered. As $M$ increases past $r^k$, these planted solutions
tend to be the only solutions with increasing probability, potentially becoming
easier to find. We show several results about the complexity and applications

the Quintuplet cluster field. From this catalogue, we selected about 24000
field stars that probably belong to the nuclear stellar disc. We used red clump
giants to deredden the sample and fit the resulting F153M luminosity function
with a linear combination of theoretical luminosity functions created from
different stellar evolutionary models. We find that >70% of the stellar
population in the nuclear disc probably formed more than 10 Gyr ago, while ~15%
formed in an event (or series of events) ~1Gyr ago. Up to 10% of the stars
appear to have formed in the past tens to hundreds of Myr. These results do not
change significantly for reasonable variations in the assumed mean metallicity,
sample selection, reddening correction, or stellar evolutionary models. We
confirm previous work that changed the formation paradigm for stars in the

seems to have been little star formation activity between its formation and

evolution of star clusters and galaxies. We continue our investigation of the
hydrodynamics of three-body encounters, focusing on binary black hole (BBH)
formation, stellar disruption, and electromagnetic (EM) emission in dynamical
interactions between a BH-star binary and a stellar-mass BH, using the
moving-mesh hydrodynamics code {\small AREPO}. This type of encounters can be
divided into two classes depending on whether the final outcome includes BBHs.
This outcome is primarily determined by which two objects meet at the first
closest approach. BBHs are more likely to form when the star and the incoming
BH encounter first with an impact parameter smaller than the binary's semimajor
axis. In this case, the star is frequently disrupted. On the other hand, when
the two BHs encounter first, frequent consequences are an orbit perturbation of
the original binary or a binary member exchange. For the parameters chosen in
this study, BBH formation, accompanied by stellar disruption, happens in
roughly 1 out of 4 encounters. The close correlation between BBH formation and
stellar disruption has possible implications for EM counterparts at the
binary's merger. The BH that disrupts the star is promptly surrounded by an
optically and geometrically thick disk with accretion rates exceeding the
Eddington limit. If the debris disk cools fast enough to become long-lived, EM
counterparts can be produced at the time of the BBH merger.

opinions taking into account both their personal beliefs and the influences of
other agents, as in the standard FJ model. Meanwhile, the second equation
models how the influence matrix involved in the opinion formation process
updates according to a homophily mechanism, by allowing both positive and

classical FJ model always asymptotically converges to a constant solution.
Moreover, in the case of a single discussion topic, the asymptotic behavior of
the system is derived in closed form.

spanned over uniform and non-uniform knot sequences, and then the generated
optimal rules are used for integration over higher-dimensional spaces using
tensor product sense. The quadrature rule search is posed as an optimization
problem and solved by a machine learning strategy based on gradient-descent.
However, since the optimization space is highly non-convex, the success of the
search strongly depends on the number of quadrature points and the parameter
initialization. Thus, we use a dynamic programming strategy that initializes
the parameters from the optimal solution over the spline space with a lower
number of knots. With this method, we found optimal quadrature rules for spline
spaces when using IGA discretizations with up to 50 uniform elements and
polynomial degrees up to 8, showing the generality of the approach in this
scenario. For non-uniform partitions, the method also finds an optimal rule in
a reasonable number of test cases. We also assess the generated optimal rules
in two practical case studies, namely, the eigenvalue problem of the Laplace
operator and the eigenfrequency analysis of freeform curved beams, where the
latter problem shows the applicability of the method to curved geometries. In
particular, the proposed method results in savings with respect to traditional
Gaussian integration of up to 44% in 1D, 68% in 2D, and 82% in 3D spaces.

negative labels, we study how these labels affect the model's explanation. We
observe that the explanation of two models, trained with full and partial

symmetry breaking. We study the interplay between explicit and spontaneous
symmetry breaking and derive a simple horizon formula for $\eta/s$, which is
valid also in the presence of explicit breaking of rotations and is in perfect
agreement with the numerical data. We observe that a source which explicitly
breaks rotational invariance suppresses the value of $\eta/s$ in the broken
phase, competing against the effects of spontaneous symmetry breaking. However,
$\eta/s$ always reaches a constant value in the limit of zero temperature,
which is never smaller than the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound, $1/4\pi$.
This behavior appears to be in contrast with previous holographic anisotropic
models which found a power-law vanishing of $\eta/s$ at small temperature. This
difference is shown to arise from the properties of the near-horizon geometry
in the extremal limit. Thus, our construction shows that the breaking of
rotations itself does not necessarily imply a violation of the KSS bound.

results to those obtained from four commonly-used single scale approaches based
on the application of aperture mass filters to the shear in real and Fourier
space. The method is validated on Euclid-like mocks from the
DUSTGRAIN-pathfinder simulations. We introduce a new matching procedure that
takes into account the theoretical signal-to-noise of detection by WL and the
filter size. We perform a complete analysis of the filters, and a comparison of
the purity and the completeness of the resulting detected catalogues. We show
that equivalent results are obtained when the detection is undertaken in real
and Fourier space, and when the algorithms are applied to the shear and the
convergence. We show that the multiscale method applied to the convergence is
faster and more efficient at detecting clusters than single scale methods
applied to the shear. We obtained an increase of 25% in the number of
detections while maintaining the same purity compared to the most up-to-date
aperture mass filter. We analyse the detected catalogues and quantify the
efficiency of the matching procedure, showing in particular that less than 5%
of the detections from the multiscale method can be ascribed to line-of-sight
alignments. The method is well-adapted to the more sensitive, wider-area,

After performing the loop integral, we expand the results in the low energy

comparisons show that the analytic expressions are very close to the full
results over a large region. We investigate the power behaviors of the these
contributions and find that some are enhanced by a kinematic factor in the low

contributions from the next-to-leading-order interactions are at the same order

contributions to the physical observable quantity $A_{PV}$ are also discussed.
Combining all the properties together, we conclude that, these analytic

encountered by previous deep-learning-based denoising models. However,
diffusion models suffer from long inference times due to the large number of

classical diffusion models and has greater flexibility. Inspired by the cold
diffusion, this paper presents a novel COntextual eRror-modulated gEneralized
Diffusion model for low-dose CT (LDCT) denoising, termed CoreDiff. First,
CoreDiff utilizes LDCT images to displace the random Gaussian noise and employs
a novel mean-preserving degradation operator to mimic the physical process of
CT degradation, significantly reducing sampling steps thanks to the informative
LDCT images as the starting point of the sampling process. Second, to alleviate
the error accumulation problem caused by the imperfect restoration operator in
the sampling process, we propose a novel ContextuaL Error-modulAted Restoration
Network (CLEAR-Net), which can leverage contextual information to constrain the
sampling process from structural distortion and modulate time step embedding
features for better alignment with the input at the next time step. Third, to
rapidly generalize to a new, unseen dose level with as few resources as
possible, we devise a one-shot learning framework to make CoreDiff generalize
faster and better using only a single LDCT image (un)paired with NDCT.
Extensive experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our CoreDiff
outperforms competing methods in denoising and generalization performance, with
a clinically acceptable inference time.

Fock term to the energy and the self-energies, and in addition we investigate
the nucleon's compositeness and finite size effects (confinement and form
factors) and short range correlations modeled by a Jastrow ansatz. These
effects are added step by step, such that their impact on the dense matter
properties can be analysed in details. The parameters of the model are adjusted
to reproduce fundamental properties related to the QCD theory at low energy,
such as the chiral symmetry breaking, nucleon's quark substructure and
Lattice-QCD predictions, as well as two empirical properties at saturation: the
binding energy and the density. All other empirical parameters, e.g., symmetry
energy and its slope, incompressibility modulus, effective mass, as well as
spin-isospin Landau-Midgal parameter are predictions of the models and can be
used to evaluate the gain of the different approximation schemes in describing
nuclear properties. Bayesian statistics is employed in order to propagate
parameter uncertainties into predictions for the nuclear matter properties. We
show that the splitting of the effective Landau mass is largely influenced by
the value of the $\rho^T$ coupling, and we show that the fit to the symmetry
energy, which induces an increase of the coupling constant $g_\rho$ by about
20-25% compared to the case where it is fixed by the quark model, provides a
very good EoS compatible with the present nuclear physics knowledge.

Submitted to ApJL",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Thermonuclear supernovae, or Type-Ia supernovae (SNeIa), are an essential
tool of cosmology. Precise cosmological constraints are extracted from a Hubble
diagram defined by homogeneous distance indicators, but supernova homogeneity
is not guaranteed. The degree of heterogeneity within the SNeIa parent
population is unknown. In addition, event selections and standardization
procedures are based on empirical, optically-measured observables rather than
fundamental thermonuclear properties. Systematics are a natural consequence of
event selection from a diverse parent population. Quantifying the impact of
diversity-driven systematics is crucial to optimizing SNeIa as cosmic probes.
In this work, the empirical observables are used to calibrate previously
unidentified diversity-driven systematic uncertainties. The foundation of this
approach is the concept of ""supernova siblings'', two or more supernovae hosted
by the same parent galaxy. Sibling-based calibrations isolate intrinsic
differences between supernovae; they control for source distance and host
galaxy dependencies that can conceal systematics or lead to their
underestimation. Newly calibrated distance modulus uncertainties are
approximately an order of magnitude larger than previously reported. The
physical origin of these uncertainties is plausibly attributed to the diverse
thermonuclear scenarios responsible for SNeIa and the inhomogeneous apparent
magnitudes induced by this diversity. Systematics mitigation strategies are
discussed. Cosmological parameter constraints extracted from a re-analysis of
the Pantheon+ SNeIa dataset are weaker than previously reported. Agreement with
early-Universe parameter estimates is achieved for a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology,

a function of the squared modulus of zeta. In the loxodromic and hyperbolic
cases, the conformal factor is either monotonically increasing or monotonically
decreasing as a function of the real variable given by the modulus of zeta. The
Killing vector field of the Bondi metric is also studied in correspondence with
the four admissible families of BMS transformations. Eventually, all BMS
transformations are re-expressed in the homogeneous coordinates suggested by

Within this broader framework, the geometry of such transformations is studied

targets) so far in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) with 53 different bands of
data to study the MLR of RSGs. In order to match the observed spectral energy
distributions (SEDs), a theoretical grid of 17,820 Oxygen-rich models
(``normal'' and ``dusty'' grids are half-and-half) is created by the
radiatively-driven wind model of the DUSTY code, covering a wide range of dust
parameters. We select the best model for each target by calculating the minimal
modified chi-square and visual inspection. The resulting MLRs from DUSTY are
converted to real MLRs based on the scaling relation, for which a total MLR of
$6.16\times10^{-3}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is measured (corresponding to a
dust-production rate of $\sim6\times10^{-6}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), with a
typical MLR of $\sim10^{-6}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ for the general population of
the RSGs. The complexity of mass-loss estimation based on the SED is fully
discussed for the first time, indicating large uncertainties based on the
photometric data (potentially up to one order of magnitude or more). The
Hertzsprung-Russell and luminosity versus median absolute deviation diagrams of
the sample indicate the positive relation between luminosity and MLR.
Meanwhile, the luminosity versus MLR diagrams show a ``knee-like'' shape with
enhanced mass-loss occurring above $\log_{10}(L/L_\odot)\approx4.6$, which may
be due to the degeneracy of luminosity, pulsation, low surface gravity,
convection, and other factors. We derive our MLR relation by using a
third-order polynomial to fit the sample and compare our result with previous
empirical MLR prescriptions. Given that our MLR prescription is based on a much
larger sample than previous determinations, it provides a more accurate
relation at the cool and luminous region of the H-R diagram at low-metallicity

systems that are subjected to Markovian drive and dissipation and are described
by a quadratic Liouvillian which has parity-time (PT) symmetry. In recent work,
we have shown that such systems relax locally to a maximum entropy ensemble
that we have dubbed the PT-symmetric generalized Gibbs ensemble (PTGGE), in
analogy to the generalized Gibbs ensemble that describes the steady state of
isolated integrable quantum many-body systems after a quench. Here, using
driven-dissipative versions of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and the
Kitaev chain as paradigmatic model systems, we corroborate and substantially
expand upon our previous results. In particular, we confirm the validity of a
dissipative quasiparticle picture at finite dissipation by demonstrating light
cone spreading of correlations and the linear growth and saturation to the
PTGGE prediction of the quasiparticle-pair contribution to the subsystem
entropy in the PT-symmetric phase. Further, we introduce the concept of
directional pumping phases, which is related to the non-Hermitian topology of
the Liouvillian and based upon qualitatively different dynamics of the dual
string order parameter and the subsystem fermion parity in the SSH model and
the Kitaev chain, respectively: Depending on the postquench parameters, there
can be pumping of string order and fermion parity through both ends of a
subsystem corresponding to a finite segment of the one-dimensional lattice,
through only one end, or there can be no pumping at all. We show that
transitions between dynamical pumping phases give rise to a new and independent

ionized intergalactic medium to quantify the clustering of Ly$\alpha$ emitters
as measured by the Void Probability function (VPF), and how it evolves under
different ionization scenarios. We quantify how well we might be able to
distinguish between these scenarios with a deep spectroscopic survey using the
future Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Since Roman will be able to carry out
blind spectroscopic surveys of Ly$\alpha$ emitters continuously between
$7<z<12$ to sensitivities of at least $10^{-17}$ erg sec$^{-1}$ over a wide
field of view, it can measure the epoch of reionization as well as the pace of
ionization of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compare deep Roman surveys
covering roughly 1, 4, and 16 deg$^2$, and quantify what constraints on
reionization the VPF may find for these surveys. A survey of 1 deg$^2$ would
distinguish between very late reionization and early reionization to 3$\sigma$
near $z=7.7$ with the VPF. The VPF of a 4 deg$^2$ survey can distinguish
between slow vs.\ fast, and early vs.\ late, reionization at $> 3-4\sigma$ at
several redshifts between $7<z<9$. However, a survey of 13-16 deg$^2$ would
allow the VPF to give several robust constraints ($>5-8\sigma$) across the
epoch of reionization, and would yield a detailed history of the reionization
of the IGM and its effect on Lyman-$\alpha$ Emitter clustering.

dataset of micro-CT scans of 12 types of bugs, such as insects and larvae.
BugNIST contains 9437 volumes where 9087 are of individual bugs and 350 are
mixtures of bugs and other material. The goal of BugNIST is to benchmark
classification and detection methods, and we have designed the detection
challenge such that detection models are trained on scans of individual bugs
and tested on bug mixtures. Models capable of solving this task will be
independent of the context, i.e., the surrounding material. This is a great
advantage if the context is unknown or changing, as is often the case in
micro-CT. Our initial baseline analysis shows that current state-of-the-art
deep learning methods classify individual bugs very well, but has great
difficulty with the detection challenge. Hereby, BugNIST enables research in
image analysis areas that until now have missed relevant data - both
classification, detection, and hopefully more.

first, the optimization and design of unit-cells to achieve desired

training scheme to learn the flexible semantic model, which enables edge
devices to customize the transmission fidelity with different widths of the
semantic model. After that, we focus on the FAST optimization problem to
minimize the system energy consumption with latency and fidelity constraints.
Following that, the optimal transmission strategies including the scaling
factor of the semantic model, computing frequency, and transmitting power are
derived for the devices. Experiment results indicate that, when compared to the
baseline transmission schemes, the proposed framework can reduce up to one
order of magnitude of the system energy consumption and data size for
maintaining reasonable data fidelity.

wavelength-dependent seeing, and we show their impact on the cosmological

Ia) to quantify astrometric offsets caused by DCR and simulate point spread
functions (PSFs) using the GalSIM package to predict the shapes of the PSFs
with DCR and wavelength-dependent seeing. We calculate the magnitude
corrections and apply them to the magnitudes computed by the DES-SN5YR
photometric pipeline. We find that for the DES-SN5YR analysis, not accounting
for the astrometric offsets and changes in the PSF shape cause an average bias
of $+0.2$ mmag and $-0.3$ mmag respectively, with standard deviations of $0.7$
mmag and $2.7$ mmag across all DES observing bands (\textit{griz}) throughout
all redshifts. When the DCR and seeing effects are not accounted for, we find
that $w$ and $\Omega_m$ are lower by less than $0.004\pm0.02$ and
$0.001\pm0.01$ respectively, with $0.02$ and $0.01$ being the $1\sigma$

constraints of the DES-SN5YR sample, future surveys with much higher
statistics, lower systematics, and especially those that observe in the $u$
band will require these corrections as wavelength-dependent atmospheric effects
are larger at shorter wavelengths. We also discuss limitations of our method
and how they can be better accounted for in future surveys.

However, in practice, low-quality (LQ) medical images, such as images that are
hazy/blurry, have uneven illumination, or are out of focus, among others, are
often obtained during data acquisition. This leads to difficulties in the
screening and diagnosis of medical diseases. Several generative adversarial
networks (GAN)-based image enhancement methods have been proposed and have
shown promising results. However, there is a quality-originality trade-off
among these methods in the sense that they produce visually pleasing results
but lose the ability to preserve originality, especially the structural inputs.
Moreover, to our knowledge, there is no objective metric in evaluating the
structure preservation of medical image enhancement methods in unsupervised
settings due to the unavailability of paired ground-truth data. In this study,
we propose a framework for practical unsupervised medical image enhancement
that includes (1) a non-reference objective evaluation of structure
preservation for medical image enhancement tasks called Laplacian structural
similarity index measure (LaSSIM), which is based on SSIM and the Laplacian
pyramid, and (2) a novel unsupervised GAN-based method called Laplacian medical
image enhancement (LaMEGAN) to support the improvement of both originality and
quality from LQ images. The LaSSIM metric does not require clean reference
images and has been shown to be superior to SSIM in capturing image structural
changes under image degradations, such as strong blurring on different
datasets. The experiments demonstrated that our LaMEGAN achieves a satisfactory
balance between quality and originality, with robust structure preservation
performance while generating compelling visual results with very high image
quality scores. The code will be made available at

well-posedness vs. finite time blow-up, as well as other aspects of the
dynamics. These authors have also constructed solitary wave solutions, via the
method of mountain pass/Nehari manifold, in an appropriate range of parameters.
Specifically, the waves exist only in spatial dimensions $n=1,2,3$. They have
also established some stability/instability results for these waves.
  In this work, we systematically build and study solitary waves for this
important model. We construct the waves in the largest possible parameter
space, and we provide a complete classification of their stability. In
dimension one, we show stability, whereas, in $n=2,3$, they are generally
spectrally unstable, except for a small region, where they do enjoy an extra
pseudo-conformal symmetry.
  Finally, we discuss instability by a blow-up. In the case $n=3$, and for a
more restrictive set of parameters, we use virial identities methods to derive
the strong instability, in the spirit of Ohta's approach. In $n=2$, the virial
identities reduce matters, via conservation of mass and energy, to the initial
data. Our conclusions mirror closely the well-known results for the scalar
cubic focusing NLS, while the proofs are much more involved.

possible nonmolecular state or contributions from missing coupled channels.
From the fits to the data we conclude that the state observed is clearly of
molecular nature from the $D^0 D^{*+}$, $D^+ D^{*0}$ components and the
possible contribution of a nonmolecular state or missing channels is smaller
than 3\%, compatible with zero. We also determine that the state has isospin
$I=0$ with a minor isospin breaking from the different masses of the channels
involved, and the probabilities of the $D^0 D^{*+}$, $D^+ D^{*0}$ channels are
of the order of 69\% and 29\% with uncertainties of 1\%. The differences
between these probabilities should not be interpreted as a measure of the
isospin violation. Due to the short range of the strong interaction where the
isospin is manifested, the isospin nature is provided by the couplings of the
state found to the $D^0 D^{*+}$, $D^+ D^{*0}$ components, and our results for
these couplings indicate that we have an $I=0$ state with a very small isospin
breaking. We also find that the potential obtained provides a repulsive
interaction in $I=1$, preventing the formation of an $I=1$ state, in agreement
with what is observed in the experiment.

Abelian or non-Abelian, to become physically meaningful. We show that this
condition can be relaxed in non-Hermitian systems by proposing and studying a
generalized Hatano--Nelson model with imbalanced non-Abelian hopping. Despite
lacking gauge flux in one dimension, non-Abelian gauge fields create rich
non-Hermitian topological consequences. Under only nearest-neighbor coupling,
non-Abelian gauge fields enable Hopf-link bulk braiding topology, whose phase
transition accompanies the emergence of exceptional points (EPs). At both ends
of an open chain, non-Abelian gauge fields lead to the simultaneous presence of
non-Hermitian skin modes, whose population can be effectively tuned. Asymptotic
analysis shows that this tuning mechanism stems from the interplay between the
Abelian Hatano--Nelson coupling and effective high-order hopping, which becomes
substantial near the EP phase transition condition. The predicted non-Hermitian
phenomena, enabled by non-Abelian gauge fields, could be realized in synthetic
dimensional optical platforms such as time-multiplexed photonic mesh lattices
and driven ring resonators.

realistic representation in general circulation models (GCMs) still poses great
challenges in modeling the atmosphere. Here, we present a neural network-based
diagnostic scheme that uses the grid-mean temperature, pressure, liquid and ice
water mixing ratios, and relative humidity to simulate the sub-grid cloud
fraction. The scheme, trained using CloudSat data with explicit consideration
of grid sizes, realistically simulates the observed cloud fraction with a
correlation coefficient (r) > 0.9 for liquid-, mixed-, and ice-phase clouds.
The scheme also captures the observed non-monotonic relationship between cloud
fraction and relative humidity and is computationally efficient, and robust for
GCMs with a variety of horizontal and vertical resolutions.
  For illustrative purposes, we conducted comparative analyses of the 2006-2019
climatological-mean cloud fractions among CloudSat, and simulations from the
new scheme and the Xu-Randall scheme (optimized the same way as the new
scheme). The network-based scheme improves not only the spatial distribution of
the total cloud fraction but also the cloud vertical structure (r > 0.99). For
example, the biases of too-many high-level clouds over the tropics and too-many
low-level clouds over regions around 60{\deg}S and 60{\deg}N in the Xu-Randall
scheme are significantly reduced. These improvements are also found to be
insensitive to the spatio-temporal variability of large-scale meteorology
conditions, implying that the scheme can be used in different climate regimes.

reactive interfaces using a model-agnostic piecewise-polytropic hadronic
equation of state and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for three-flavor quark
matter. For the hadronic phase we use a soft, an intermediate and a stiff
parametrization that match at $1.1 n_0$ {with predictions} based on chiral
effective field theory (cEFT) interactions. In the NJL Lagrangian we include
scalar, vector and 't Hooft interactions. The vector coupling constant $g_{v}$
is treated as a free parameter. We also consider that there is a split between
the deconfinement and the chiral phase transitions which is controlled by
changing the conventional value of the vacuum pressure $-\Omega_{0}$ in the NJL
thermodynamic potential by $-\left(\Omega_{0}+\delta \Omega_{0}\right)$, being
$\delta \Omega_{0}$ a free parameter. We analyze the mass-radius ($M$-$R$)
relation in the case of rapid ($\tau \ll 1 \, \mathrm{ms}$) and slow ($\tau \gg
1 \, \mathrm{ms}$) conversions, being $\tau$ the reaction timescale. In the
case of slow interface reactions we find $M$-$R$ curves with a cusp at the
maximum mass point where a pure hadronic branch and a slow-stable hybrid star
(SSHS) branch coincide. We find that the length of the slow-stable branch grows
with the increase of the transition density and the energy density jump at the
hadron-quark interface. We calculate the tidal deformabilities of SSHSs and
analyse them in the light of the GW170817 event.

however training these models across diverse domains is challenging and
requires an huge amount of training data and knowledge of pose distribution.
Text-guided domain adaptation methods have allowed the generator to be adapted
to the target domains using text prompts, thereby obviating the need for
assembling numerous data. Recently, DATID-3D presents impressive quality of
samples in text-guided domain, preserving diversity in text by leveraging
text-to-image diffusion. However, adapting 3D generators to domains with
significant domain gaps from the source domain still remains challenging due to
issues in current text-to-image diffusion models as following: 1) shape-pose
trade-off in diffusion-based translation, 2) pose bias, and 3) instance bias in
the target domain, resulting in inferior 3D shapes, low text-image
correspondence, and low intra-domain diversity in the generated samples. To
address these issues, we propose a novel pipeline called PODIA-3D, which uses
pose-preserved text-to-image diffusion-based domain adaptation for 3D
generative models. We construct a pose-preserved text-to-image diffusion model
that allows the use of extremely high-level noise for significant domain
changes. We also propose specialized-to-general sampling strategies to improve
the details of the generated samples. Moreover, to overcome the instance bias,
we introduce a text-guided debiasing method that improves intra-domain
diversity. Consequently, our method successfully adapts 3D generators across

that our approach outperforms existing 3D text-guided domain adaptation methods

First, we demonstrate how incorporating a history stack of data into the

under relaxed excitation conditions. Our key observation is that the estimate
generated by this algorithm at any point in time is an affine transformation of
the initial estimate. This property allows for parameterizing the uncertainty
associated with such estimates using objects that are closed under affine
transformation, such as zonotopes and Gaussian distributions, and enables the
efficient propagation of such uncertainty metrics along the trajectory of the
parameter estimates. We illustrate how such an approach facilitates the
synthesis of safety-critical controllers for systems with parametric
uncertainty using control barrier functions. Finally, we demonstrate the
advantages of online adaptation and uncertainty quantification via numerical

Models of this kind typically consider a population of fixed size and
distribution. Here we consider eco-evolutionary dynamics where population size
and distribution can change through birth, death and migration, all of which
are separate processes. This allows complex interaction and migration
behaviours that are dependent on competition. For migration, we assume that the
response of individuals to competition is governed by tolerance to their group
members, such that less tolerant individuals are more likely to move away due
to competition. We looked at the success of a mutant in the rare mutation limit
for the complete, cycle and star networks. Unlike models with fixed population
size and distribution, the distribution of the individuals per site is
explicitly modelled by considering the dynamics of the population. This in turn
determines the mutant appearance distribution for each network. Where a mutant
appears impacts its success as it determines the competition it faces. For low
and high migration rates the complete and cycle networks have similar mutant
appearance distributions resulting in similar success levels for an invading
mutant. A higher migration rate in the star network is detrimental for mutant
success because migration results in a crowded central site where a mutant is
more likely to appear.

the question of 'tight enough' is left to the user, we provide an additional

identifiability of statistical models with practical consideration. The
framework is formulated in a Bayesian statistical setting which is the
foundation for parameter estimation under aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.
No assumptions are made about the structure of the statistical model or the
prior distribution while constructing the estimator. The estimator has the
following notable advantages: first, no controlled experiment or data is
required to conduct the practical identifiability analysis; second, different
forms of uncertainties, such as model form, parameter, or measurement can be
taken into account; third, the identifiability analysis is global, rather than
being dependent on a realization of parameters. If an individual parameter has
low identifiability, it can belong to an identifiable subset such that
parameters within the subset have a functional relationship and thus have a
combined effect on the statistical model. The practical identifiability
framework is extended to highlight the dependencies between parameter pairs
that emerge a posteriori to find identifiable parameter subsets. Examining the
practical identifiability of an individual parameter along with its
dependencies with other parameters is informative for an estimation-centric
parameterization and model selection. The applicability of the proposed
approach is demonstrated using a linear Gaussian model and a non-linear
methane-air reduced kinetics model.

it is also constrained by energy needed to form memories. Experiments have
shown that learning simple conditioning tasks already carries a significant
metabolic cost. Yet, learning a task like MNIST to 95% accuracy appears to
require at least 10^{8} synaptic updates. Therefore the brain has likely
evolved to be able to learn using as little energy as possible. We explored the
energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks. Based on a
parsimonious energy model, we propose two plasticity restricting algorithms
that save energy: 1) only modify synapses with large updates, and 2) restrict
plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network.
Combining these two methods leads to substantial energy savings while only
incurring a small increase in learning time. In biology networks are often much
larger than the task requires. In particular in that case, large savings can be
achieved. Thus competitively restricting plasticity helps to save metabolic
energy associated to synaptic plasticity. The results might lead to a better
understanding of biological plasticity and a better match between artificial
and biological learning. Moreover, the algorithms might also benefit hardware
because in electronics memory storage is energetically costly as well.

One possibility to speed-up minimization and add stability is the use of
Automatic Differentiation (AD). Unlike for numerical differentiation, the
computation cost scales linearly with the number of parameters, making AD
particularly appealing for statistical models with many parameters. In this
paper, we report on one possible way to implement AD in RooFit. Our approach is
to add a facility to generate C++ code for a full RooFit model automatically.
Unlike the original RooFit model, this generated code is free of virtual
function calls and other RooFit-specific overhead. In particular, this code is
then used to produce the gradient automatically with Clad. Clad is a source
transformation AD tool implemented as a plugin to the clang compiler, which
automatically generates the derivative code for input C++ functions. We show
results demonstrating the improvements observed when applying this code
generation strategy to HistFactory and other commonly used RooFit models.
HistFactory is the subcomponent of RooFit that implements binned likelihood
models with probability densities based on histogram templates. These models
frequently have a very large number of free parameters and are thus an
interesting first target for AD support in RooFit.

requires two- and three-particle Green's functions to be evaluated by e.g. the
Bethe-Salpeter equation. On the other hand, optical phonon scattering is
thought to be phase-breaking, which, if true, would eliminate this concern over
long-range interactions. In seeking to determine just to what extent phase
breaking is important, one could treat the polar modes as a real space
potential, as is done for impurities, and examine the occurrence of any such

functions satisfying the modern definition that, in the last two decades,
gained prevalence in the applications concerning function spaces and
interpolation. We show, that every slowly varying function of this type is
equivalent to a slowly varying function that has continuous classical
derivatives of all orders.

and treating chronic pulmonary diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted
the importance of early detection of changes in SpO2, particularly in
asymptomatic patients with clinical deterioration. However, conventional SpO2
measurement methods rely on contact-based sensing, presenting the risk of
cross-contamination and complications in patients with impaired limb perfusion.
Additionally, pulse oximeters may not be available in marginalized communities
and undeveloped countries. To address these limitations and provide a more
comfortable and unobtrusive way to monitor SpO2, recent studies have
investigated SpO2 measurement using videos. However, measuring SpO2 using
cameras in a contactless way, particularly from smartphones, is challenging due
to weaker physiological signals and lower optical selectivity of smartphone
camera sensors. The system includes three main steps: 1) extraction of the
region of interest (ROI), which includes the palm and back of the hand, from
the smartphone-captured videos; 2) spatial averaging of the ROI to produce R,
G, and B time series; and 3) feeding the time series into an
optophysiology-inspired CNN for SpO2 estimation. Our proposed method can
provide a more efficient and accurate way to monitor SpO2 using videos captured
from consumer-grade smartphones, which can be especially useful in telehealth
and health screening settings.

"2305.02802","Benjamin Kenwright","Benjamin Kenwright","Dual-Quaternion Fourier Transform",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Fourier transform (FT) plays a crucial role in a broad range of applications,
from enhancement, restoration and analysis through to security, compression and
manipulation. The Fourier transform (FT) is a process that converts a function
into a form that describes the frequencies. This process has been extended to
many domains and numerical representations (including quaternions). However, in
this article, we present a new approach using dual-quaternions. As
dual-quaternions offer an efficient and compact symbolic form with unique
mathematical properties. While dual-quaternions have established themselves in
many fields of science and computing as an efficient mathematical model for
providing an unambiguous, un-cumbersome, computationally effective means of
representing multi-component data, not much research has been done to combine
them with Fourier processes. Dual-quaternions are simply the unification of
dual-number theory with hypercomplex numbers; a mathematical concept that
allows multi-variable data sets to be transformed, combined, manipulated and
interpolated in a unified non-linear manner. We define a Dual-Quaternion
Fourier transform (DQFT) for dual-quaternion valued data over dual-quaternion
domains. This opens the door to new types of analysis, manipulation and
filtering techniques. We also present the Inverse Dual-Quaternion Fourier
Transform (IDQFT). The DQFT unlocks the potential provided by hypercomplex
algebra in higher dimensions useful for solving dual-quaternion partial
differential equations or functional equations (e.g., for multicomponent data
analysis)

fixed number equal weight. A version that elects a fixed a number of candidates
with equal weight does exist, but it is non-deterministic, and is known as
COWPEA Lottery. This is the only proportional method known to pass
monotonicity, Independence of Irrelevant Ballots, and Independence of
Universally Approved Candidates. There are also ways to convert COWPEA and
COWPEA Lottery to score or graded voting methods.

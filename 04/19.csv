believed to be predominantly accelerated at shocks driven by coronal mass
ejections (CMEs). Ion charge state and composition analyses suggest that the
origin of the seed particle population for the mechanisms of particle
acceleration at CME-driven shocks is not the bulk solar wind thermal material,
but rather a suprathermal population present in the solar wind. This
suprathermal population could result from remnant material accelerated in prior
solar flares and/or preceding CME-driven shocks. In this work, we examine the
distribution of this suprathermal particle population in the inner heliosphere
by combining a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of the solar wind and a
Monte-Carlo simulation of particle acceleration and transport. Assuming that
the seed particles are uniformly distributed near the Sun by solar flares of
various magnitudes, we study the longitudinal distribution of the seed
population at multiple heliocentric distances. We consider a non-uniform
background solar wind, consisting of fast and slow streams that lead to
compression and rarefaction regions within the solar wind. Our simulations show
that the seed population at a particular location (e.g., 1 au) is strongly
modulated by the underlying solar wind configuration. Corotating interaction
regions (CIRs) and merged interactions regions (MIRs) can strongly alter the
energy spectra of the seed particle populations. In addition, cross-field
diffusion plays an important role in mitigating strong variations of the seed
population in both space and energy.

Super-X divertor show an unprecedented impact of plasma-molecular interactions
involving molecular ions (likely $D_2^+$), resulting in strong ion sinks,
leading to a reduction of ion target flux. This starts to occur as the
ionisation source detaches from the target, leading to a build-up of molecules
below the ionisation source who get excited, resulting in Molecular Activated
Recombination (MAR) and Dissociation (MAD). The particle sinks in the divertor
chamber exceed the ion sources in the middle of the detached operational regime
before electron-ion recombination (EIR) starts to occur, demonstrating the
strong capabilities for particle exhaust in the Super-X Configuration. MAD is
the dominant volumetric neutral atom creation mechanism and results in
significant power losses. This, combined with electron-impact excitation
preceding ionisation, are the dominant power loss mechanisms in the divertor
chamber. As the plasma becomes more deeply detached, EIR starts to occur and
electron temperatures below 0.2 eV are achieved. Even at such low electron
temperature conditions, MAR is observed to be an important ion sink mechanism,
which suggests the presence of highly vibrationally excited molecules in the
cold detached regime. The total radiative power loss is consistent with
extrapolations of spectroscopic inferences to hydrogenic radiative power
losses, which suggests that intrinsic impurity radiation, despite the carbon
walls, is minor. These observations are observed in Ohmic L-mode, ELM-free
H-mode and type I ELMy H-mode discharges.

sparse rewards with a model predictive controller (MPC)
\lstinline[columns=fixed]{actor}, thereby offering a safe policy. On the one
hand, the RL \lstinline[columns=fixed]{planner} learns from sparse rewards by
selecting intermediate goals that are easy to achieve in the short term and
promising to lead to target goals in the long term. On the other hand, the MPC
\lstinline[columns=fixed]{actor} takes the suggested intermediate goals from
the RL \lstinline[columns=fixed]{planner} as the input and predicts how the
robot's action will enable it to reach that goal while avoiding any obstacles
over a short period of time. We evaluated our method on four challenging

leveraging the complementary strengths of these two components, the agent can

based on spectral indices calculated using temporally-matched Swift-XRT data

glioblastoma (a responder and a non-responder) who underwent RT on a
0.35T-MRI-Linac. The detection of post-contrast enhanced volumes was evaluated
by comparing the 3DT1w images from the 0.35T-MRI-Linac to images obtained using
a 3T-standalone scanner. The DCE data were tested temporally and spatially
using data from the flow phantom and patients. K-trans maps were derived from
DCE at three time points (a week before treatment: Pre RT, four weeks through
treatment: Mid RT, and three weeks after treatment: Post RT) and were validated
with patients treatment outcomes. The 3D-T1 contrast enhancement volumes were
visually and volumetrically similar (+/- 0.6-3.6%) between 0.35T MRI-Linac and
3T. DCE images showed temporal stability, and associated K-trans maps were
consistent with patient response to treatment. On average, K-trans values
showed a 54% decrease and 8.6% increase for a responder and non-responder
respectively when Pre RT and Mid RT images were compared. Our findings support
the feasibility of obtaining post-contrast 3DT1w and DCE data from patients
with glioblastoma using a 0.35T MRI-Linac system.

z=7.5419, obtained with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA).
P\=oniu\=a'ena belongs to the HYPerluminous quasars at the Epoch of
ReionizatION (HYPERION) sample of 17 $z>6$ quasars selected to be powered by
supermassive black holes (SMBH) which experienced the fastest mass growth in
the first Gyr of the Universe. The one reported here is the highest-redshift
measurement of the cold and dense molecular gas to date. The host galaxy is
unresolved and the line luminosity implies a molecular reservoir of $\rm
M(H_2)=(2.2\pm0.2)\times 10^{10}$ $\rm M_\odot$, assuming a CO spectral line
energy distribution typical of high-redshift quasars and a conversion factor
$\alpha=0.8$ $\rm M_{\odot} (K\,km \, s^{-1} \,pc^{2})^{-1} $. We model the
cold dust spectral energy distribution (SED) to derive a dust mass of M$_{\rm
dust} =(2.1\pm 0.7)\times 10^8$ $\rm M_\odot$, and thus a gas to dust ratio
$\sim100$. Both the gas and dust mass are not dissimilar from the reservoir
found for luminous quasars at $z\sim6$. We use the CO detection to derive an
estimate of the cosmic mass density of $\rm H_2$, $\Omega_{H_2} \simeq 1.31
\times 10^{-5}$. This value is in line with the general trend suggested by
literature estimates at $ z < 7 $ and agrees fairly well with the latest
theoretical expectations of non-equilibrium molecular-chemistry cosmological
simulations of cold gas at early times.

  with arXiv:2104.10154",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Real-scanned point clouds are often incomplete due to viewpoint, occlusion,
and noise, which hampers 3D geometric modeling and perception. Existing point
cloud completion methods tend to generate global shape skeletons and hence lack
fine local details. Furthermore, they mostly learn a deterministic
partial-to-complete mapping, but overlook structural relations in man-made
objects. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a variational
framework, Variational Relational point Completion Network (VRCNet) with two
appealing properties: 1) Probabilistic Modeling. In particular, we propose a
dual-path architecture to enable principled probabilistic modeling across
partial and complete clouds. One path consumes complete point clouds for
reconstruction by learning a point VAE. The other path generates complete
shapes for partial point clouds, whose embedded distribution is guided by
distribution obtained from the reconstruction path during training. 2)
Relational Enhancement. Specifically, we carefully design point self-attention
kernel and point selective kernel module to exploit relational point features,
which refines local shape details conditioned on the coarse completion. In
addition, we contribute multi-view partial point cloud datasets (MVP and MVP-40
dataset) containing over 200,000 high-quality scans, which render partial 3D
shapes from 26 uniformly distributed camera poses for each 3D CAD model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that VRCNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on all standard point cloud completion benchmarks. Notably, VRCNet
shows great generalizability and robustness on real-world point cloud scans.
Moreover, we can achieve robust 3D classification for partial point clouds with
the help of VRCNet, which can highly increase classification accuracy.

companion (10-20% of the Milky Way mass) and just passed the pericentre of its
orbit, likely for the first time. The gravitational perturbation caused by the
LMC is manifested at different levels. The most immediate effect is the
deflection of orbits of stars, stellar streams or satellite galaxies passing in
the vicinity of the LMC. Less well known but equally important is the
displacement (reflex motion) of central regions of the Milky Way about the
centre of mass of both galaxies. Since the Milky Way is not a rigid body, this
displacement varies with the distance from the LMC, and as a result, the Galaxy
is deformed and its outer regions (beyond a few tens kpc) acquire a net
velocity with respect to its centre. These phenomena need to be taken into

data, and improvements on the modelling side are also necessary for an adequate

segmentation network by using simple yet effective adapters. By integrating
task-specific knowledge with general knowledge learnt by the large model,
SAM-Adapter can significantly elevate the performance of SAM in challenging
tasks as shown in extensive experiments. We can even outperform task-specific
network models and achieve state-of-the-art performance in the task we tested:
camouflaged object detection, shadow detection. We also tested polyp
segmentation (medical image segmentation) and achieves better results. We
believe our work opens up opportunities for utilizing SAM in downstream tasks,
with potential applications in various fields, including medical image
processing, agriculture, remote sensing, and more.

on the mitigation of systematics from cosmic infrared background (CIB) and
thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) signals in kinematic SZ (kSZ) power spectrum
and CMB lensing. We show the cross-spectrum measurement between two CMB maps
created by nulling the contributions from CIB (CIB-free map) and tSZ (tSZ-free
map) to be robust for kSZ as the approach significantly suppresses the total
contribution of CIB and tSZ signals. Similarly, for CMB lensing, we use the
approach introduced by Madhavacheril & Hill (2018) but with a slight
modification by using the tSZ-free and CIB-free maps in the two legs of the
quadratic estimator. By cross-correlating the CMB lensing map created using
this technique with galaxy surveys, we show that the biases from both CIB/tSZ
are negligible. We also compute the impact of unmodeled CIB/tSZ residuals on
kSZ and cosmological parameters finding that the kSZ measured using the
standard ILC to be significantly biased. The kSZ estimate from the cross-ILC
remains less affected by CIB/tSZ making it crucial for CMB surveys such as the
South Pole Telescope (SPT), Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4. With the
cross-ILC method, we find the total kSZ power spectrum can be measured at very
high significance: $35\sigma$ by SPT, $22\sigma$ by SO, and $80\sigma$ by
CMB-S4. We forecast constraints on the epoch of reionization using the kSZ
power spectrum and find that the duration of reionization, currently
unconstrained by {\it Planck}, can be constrained to $\sigma(z_{\rm dur})$= 1.5

realizable binary classification for VC classes was a long-standing open
problem. The results of Simon and Hanneke established sharp upper bounds in
this setting. However, the reliance of their argument on the uniform
convergence principle limits its applicability to more general learning
settings such as multiclass classification. In this paper, we address this
issue by providing optimal high probability risk bounds through a framework
that surpasses the limitations of uniform convergence arguments.
  Our framework converts the leave-one-out error of permutation invariant
predictors into high probability risk bounds. As an application, by adapting
the one-inclusion graph algorithm of Haussler, Littlestone, and Warmuth, we
propose an algorithm that achieves an optimal PAC bound for binary
classification. Specifically, our result shows that certain aggregations of
one-inclusion graph algorithms are optimal, addressing a variant of a classic
question posed by Warmuth.
  We further instantiate our framework in three settings where uniform
convergence is provably suboptimal. For multiclass classification, we prove an
optimal risk bound that scales with the one-inclusion hypergraph density of the
class, addressing the suboptimality of the analysis of Daniely and
Shalev-Shwartz. For partial hypothesis classification, we determine the optimal
sample complexity bound, resolving a question posed by Alon, Hanneke, Holzman,
and Moran. For realizable bounded regression with absolute loss, we derive an
optimal risk bound that relies on a modified version of the scale-sensitive
dimension, refining the results of Bartlett and Long. Our rates surpass
standard uniform convergence-based results due to the smaller complexity
measure in our risk bound.

allocate the delivery operations. Indeed, carriers' decisions largely affect
the platform's revenue. In this paper, we model this problem using bilevel
programming. At the upper level, the platform decides how to assign the orders
to the carriers; at the lower level, each carrier solves a profitable tour
problem to determine which offered requests to accept, based on her own profit
maximization. Possibly, the platform can influence carriers' decisions by
determining also the compensation paid for each accepted request. The two
considered settings result in two different formulations: the bilevel
profitable tour problem with fixed compensation margins and with margin

effect of correlations in materials with topological electron flat bands. The
observation of the lattice response to the emergent new phases of matter, a
soft phonon mode, has remained elusive and the microscopic origin of charge
density waves (CDWs) is still unknown. Here, we show, for the first time, a
complete melting of the ScV$_ 6$Sn$_ 6$ (166) kagome lattice. The low energy
phonon with propagation vector $\frac{1}{3} \frac{1}{3} \frac{1}{2}$ collapses
at 98 K, without the emergence of long-range charge order, which sets in with a
propagation vector $\frac{1}{3} \frac{1}{3} \frac{1}{3}$. The CDW is driven
(but locks at a different vector) by the softening of an overdamped phonon flat
plane at k$_z$=$\pi$. We observe broad phonon anomalies in momentum space,
pointing to (1) the existence of approximately flat phonon bands which gain
some dispersion due to electron renormalization, and (2) the effects of the
momentum dependent electron-phonon interaction in the CDW formation. Ab initio
and analytical calculations corroborate the experimental findings to indicate
that the weak leading order phonon instability is located at the wave vector
$\frac{1}{3} \frac{1}{3} \frac{1}{2}$ of a rather flat collapsed mode. We
analytically compute the phonon frequency renormalization from high
temperatures to the soft mode, and relate it to a peak in the orbital-resolved
susceptibility, obtaining an excellent match with both ab initio and
experimental results, and explaining the origin of the approximately flat
phonon dispersion. Our data report the first example of the collapse of a
softening of a flat phonon plane and promote the 166 compounds of the kagome

- also constitute an interesting frontier for DM physics. Hawking evaporation
itself serves as a portal through which such PBHs can illuminate new physics,
for example by emitting dark sector particles. Taking a simple DM scalar
singlet model as a template, we compute the abundance and mass of PBHs that
could have provided, by Hawking evaporation, the correct DM relic density. We
consider two classes of such PBHs: those originating from curvature
perturbations generated by inflation, and those originating from false vacuum
collapse during a first-order phase transition. For PBHs of both origins we
compute the gravitational wave (GW) signals emanating from their formation
stage: from second-order effects in the case of curvature perturbations, and
from sound waves in the case of phase transitions. The GW signals have peak
frequencies in the MHz-GHz range typical of such light PBHs. We compute the
strength of such GWs compatible with the observed DM relic density, and find
that the GW signal morphology can in principle allow one to distinguish between

unique, first-infalling jellyfish galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological
hydrodynamical galaxy simulation. These have been visually inspected to be
undergoing RPS sometime in the past 5 billion years (since $z=0.5$), have
satellite stellar masses $M_{\star}^{\rm sat}\sim10^{8-10.5}{\rm M}_\odot$, and
live in hosts with $M_{\rm 200c}\sim10^{12-14.3}{\rm M}_\odot$ at $z=0$. We
quantify the cold gas $(\leq10^{4.5}$K) removal using the tracer particles,
confirming that for these jellyfish, RPS is the dominant driver of cold gas
loss after infall. Half of these jellyfish are completely devoid of cold gas by
$z=0$, and these galaxies have earlier infall times and smaller
satellite-to-host mass ratios than those that still have some gas today. RPS
can act on jellyfish galaxies over long timescales of $\approx1.5-8$Gyr.
Jellyfish in more massive hosts are impacted by RPS for a shorter time span
and, at a fixed host halo mass, jellyfish with lower stellar masses at $z=0$
have shorter RPS time spans. While RPS may act for long periods of time, the
peak RPS period -- where at least 50% of the total RPS occurs -- begins within
$\approx1$Gyr of infall and lasts $\lesssim2$Gyr. During this period, the
jellyfish are at host-centric distances between $\sim0.2-2R_{\rm 200c}$,
illustrating that much of RPS occurs at large distances from the host galaxy.
Jellyfish continue forming stars until they have lost $\approx98$% of their
cold gas. For groups and clusters in TNG50 $(M_{\rm 200c}\sim10^{13-14.3}{\rm

jellyfish, and in general satellite galaxies, are a significant source of cold
gas accretion.

of structure smears the BAO feature by an approximately Gaussian kernel with a
smearing scale $\sigma_{\rm v}$, but does not assume any fiducial cosmology for
describing the shape of the feature itself. Using mock observations for two
realistic survey configurations assuming $\Lambda$ cold dark matter

recovered by our method in both existing and upcoming surveys. The precision of
the recovery of $r_{\rm LP}$ is always better than $1\%$, while $\sigma_{\rm

bias $b$ is separately constrained, e.g., using weak lensing observations. Our
method is also sensitive to the linear growth rate $f$, albeit with larger
uncertainties and systematic errors, especially for upcoming surveys such as

700 jellyfish galaxies at $z=0-1$ with stellar masses

evolution of the star formation along their individual evolutionary tracks. We
compare the findings for jellyfish galaxies to those of diversely-constructed
control samples, including against satellite and field galaxies with matched
redshift, stellar mass, gas fraction and host halo mass. According to TNG50,
star formation and ram-pressure stripping can indeed occur simultaneously
within any given galaxy, and frequently do so. Moreover, star formation can
also take place within the ram pressure-stripped tails, even though the latter
is typically subdominant. However, TNG50 does not predict elevated
population-wide SFRs in jellyfish compared to analog satellite galaxies with
the same stellar mass or gas fraction. Simulated jellyfish galaxies do undergo
bursts of elevated star formation along their history but, at least according
to TNG50, these do not translate into a population-wide enhancement at any

citizen-science project on the Zooniverse platform who were asked to determine
if each galaxy image resembles a jellyfish. Based on volunteer votes, each
galaxy was assigned a score determining if it is a JF or not. This paper
describes the project, the inspected satellite sample, the methodology, and the
classification process that resulted in a dataset of $5,307$
visually-identified jellyfish galaxies. We find that JF galaxies are common in
nearly all group- and cluster-sized systems, with the JF fraction increasing
with host mass and decreasing with satellite stellar mass. We highlight JF
galaxies in three relatively unexplored regimes: low-mass hosts of
$M_\mathrm{200,c}\sim10^{11.5-13}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, radial positions within
hosts exceeding the virial radius $R_\mathrm{200,c}$, and at high redshift up
to $z=2$. The full dataset of our jellyfish scores is publicly available and
can be used to select and study JF galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations.

ejection of high amounts of dust and gas. Such material can give rise to
circumbinary discs and become the cradle of new planets, yet no studies so far
have focused on the formation of circumbinary planets around DWDs. These
binaries will be the main sources of gravitational waves (GWs) detectable by
the ESA Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, opening the
possibility to detect circumbinary planets around short-period DWDs everywhere
in the Milky Way. We investigate the formation of Magrathea planets by
simulating multiple planet formation tracks to explore how seeds growing first
by pebble accretion, and then by gas accretion, are affected by the disc
environments surrounding DWDs. We present both planetary formation tracks
taking place in steady-state discs, and formation tracks taking place in discs
evolving with time. The time-dependent tracks account for both the disc
accretion rate onto the central binary and the disc photoevaporation rate
caused by stellar irradiation. Our results show that planetary formation in
circumbinary discs around DWDs can be possible. In particular, the extreme
planetary formation environment implies three main significant results: (i) the
accretion rate and the metallicity of the disc should be high in order to form
sub-stellar objects with masses up to 31 M$_J$, this is achieved only if planet
formation starts soon after the onset of the disc and if first generation seeds
are present in the disc; (ii) seeds formed within 0.1 Myr, or within 1 Myr,
from the onset of the disc can only produce sub-Neptune and Neptunian planets,
unless the disc accommodates first generation seeds with mass 10 M$_{\oplus}$;
(iii) most of the planets are finally located within 1 au from the disc centre,
while they are still undergoing the gas accretion phase.

controlled by fluctuation-dissipation relations: On the one hand, friction
suppresses fluctuations, while on the other hand the thermal noise is
proportional to friction constants. Out of equilibrium, this balance dissolves
and one can have situations where friction vanishes due to antidamping in the
presence of a finite noise level. We study a wide class of $O(N)$ field
theories where this situation is realized at a phase transition, which we
identify as a critical exceptional point. In the ordered phase, antidamping
induces a continuous limit cycle rotation of the order parameter with an
enhanced number of $2N-3$ Goldstone modes. Close to the critical exceptional
point, however, fluctuations diverge so strongly due to the suppression of
friction that in dimensions $d<4$ they universally either destroy a preexisting
static order, or give rise to a fluctuation-induced first order transition.
This is demonstrated within a non-perturbative approach based on
Dyson-Schwinger equations for $N=2$, and a generalization for arbitrary $N$,
which can be solved exactly in the long wavelength limit. We show that in order
to realize this physics it is not necessary to drive a system far out of

Saturn's C-ring tied to seismic modes in the planet, have led to dramatic
advances in our understanding of Saturn's structure. Models that match the
gravity field suggest that differential rotation, as seen in the visible
atmosphere, extends down to at least a depth of 10,000 km (1/6$^{\rm th}$ the
planet's radius). At greater depths, a variety of different investigations all
now point to a deep Saturn rotation rate of 10 hours and 33 minutes. There is
very compelling evidence for a central heavy element concentration (``core''),
that in most recent models is 12-20 Earth masses. Ring seismology strongly
suggests that the core is not entirely compact, but is dilute (mixed in with
the overlying H/He), and has a substantial radial extent, perhaps out to around
one-half of the planet's radius. A wide range of thermal evolution scenarios
can match the planet's current luminosity, with progress on better quantifying
the helium rain scenario hampered by Saturn's poorly known atmospheric helium
abundance. We discuss the relevance of magnetic field data on understanding the
planet's current interior structure. We point towards additional future work
that combines seismology and gravity within a framework that includes
differential rotation, and the utility of a Saturn entry probe.

challenging models such as the online model, where an algorithm must select the
column subset irrevocably when the columns arrive one by one. In contrast, for
other matrix losses, optimal trade-offs between the subset size and
approximation quality have not been settled, even in the offline setting. We
give a number of results towards closing these gaps.
  In the offline setting, we achieve nearly optimal bicriteria algorithms in
two settings. First, we remove a $\sqrt k$ factor from a result of [SWZ19] when
the loss function is any entrywise loss with an approximate triangle inequality
and at least linear growth. Our result is tight for the $\ell_1$ loss. We give
a similar improvement for entrywise $\ell_p$ losses for $p>2$, improving a
previous distortion of $k^{1-1/p}$ to $k^{1/2-1/p}$. Our results come from a
technique which replaces the use of a well-conditioned basis with a slightly
larger spanning set for which any vector can be expressed as a linear
combination with small Euclidean norm. We show that this technique also gives
the first oblivious $\ell_p$ subspace embeddings for $1<p<2$ with $\tilde
O(d^{1/p})$ distortion, which is nearly optimal and closes a long line of work.
  In the online setting, we give the first online subset selection algorithm

This depression shows an increase toward lower temperatures though is
particularly sensitive to gravity and metallicity. It is the single most
sensitive feature in the optical spectra of M dwarfs. The depression appears as
centered on the neutral calcium resonance line at 4227A and leads to nearby
features being weaker by about two orders of magnitude than predicted. We
consider a variety of possible causes for the depression including temperature,
gravity, metallicity, dust, damping constants, and atmospheric stratification.
We also consider relevant molecular opacities which might be the cause
identifying AlH, SiH, and NaH in the spectral region. However, none of these
solutions are satisfactory. In the absence of a more accurate determination of
the broadening of the calcium line perturbed by molecular hydrogen, we find a
promising empirical fit using a modified Lorentzian line profile for the
calcium resonance line. Such fits provide a simplistic line-broadening
description for this calcium resonance line and potentially other un-modelled
resonance lines in cool high-pressure atmospheres. Thus we claim the most
plausible cause of the blue depression in the optical spectra of M dwarfs is a
lack of appropriate treatment of line broadening for atomic calcium. The broad
wings of the calcium resonance line develop at temperatures below about 4000K

around stars bright enough to allow further characterization studies. Given our
current instrumentation and detection biases, M dwarfs are prime targets to
search for small planets that are in (or nearby) the habitable zone of their
host star. Here we use photometric observations and CARMENES radial velocity
measurements to validate a pair of transiting planet candidates found by TESS.
The data was fitted simultaneously using a Bayesian MCMC procedure taking into
account the stellar variability present in the photometric and spectroscopic
time series. We confirm the planetary origin of the two transiting candidates
orbiting around TOI-2095 (TIC 235678745). The star is a nearby M dwarf ($d =
41.90 \pm 0.03$ pc, $T_{\rm eff} = 3759 \pm 87$ K, $V = 12.6$ mag) with a
stellar mass and radius of $M_\star = 0.44 \pm 0.02 \; M_\odot$ and $R_\star =
0.44 \pm 0.02 \; R_\odot$, respectively. The planetary system is composed of
two transiting planets: TOI-2095b with an orbital period of $P_b = 17.66484 \pm
(7\times 10^{-5})$ days and TOI-2095c with $P_c = 28.17232 \pm (14\times

R_\oplus$ and $R_c = 1.33 \pm 0.08 \; R_\oplus$ for planet b and c,
respectively. We put upper limits on the masses of these objects with $M_b <
4.1 \; M_\oplus$ for the inner and $M_c < 7.4 \; M_\oplus$ for the outer planet
(95\% confidence level). These two planets present equilibrium temperatures in
the range of 300 - 350 K and are close to the inner edge of the habitable zone

z approx. 1, based on recent observations of a strongly lensed arc at this
redshift. First we derive a free-form model of MACS J0416.1-2403 using data
from the BUFFALO program. The new lens model is based on 72 multiply lensed
galaxies that produce 214 multiple images, making it the largest sample of
spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies on this cluster. The larger
coverage in BUFFALO allows us to measure the shear up to the outskirts of the
cluster, and extend the range of lensing constraints up to ~ 1 Mpc from the
central region, providing a mass estimate up to this radius. As an application,
we make predictions for the number of high-redshift multiply-lensed galaxies
detected in future observations with JWST. Then we focus on a previously known
lensed galaxy at z=1.0054, nicknamed Spock, which contains four previously
reported transients. We interpret these transients as microcaustic crossings of
SG stars and compute the probability of such events. Based on simplifications
regarding the stellar evolution, we find that microlensing (by stars in the
intracluster medium) of SG stars at z=1.0054 can fully explain these events.
The inferred abundance of SG stars is consistent with either (1) a number
density of stars with bolometric luminosities beyond the Humphreys-Davidson
(HD) limit (L ~ $6\times10^5 L_{\odot}$) that is below 400 stars per sq. kpc,
or (2) the absence of stars beyond the HD limit but with a SG number density of
~ 9000 per sq. kpc for stars with luminosities between $10^5$ and
$6\times10^5$. This is equivalent to one SG star per 10x10 pc$^2$. We finally
make predictions for future observations with JWST's NIRcam. We find that in
observations made with the F200W filter that reach 29 mag AB, if cool red SG
stars exist at z~1 beyond the HD limit, they should be easily detected in this
arc

communication. Evaluation of coded speech quality is often performed
subjectively by an absolute category rating (ACR) listening test. However, the
ACR test is impractical for online monitoring of speech communication networks.
Perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) is one of the widely used
metrics instrumentally predicting the results of an ACR test. However, the PESQ
algorithm requires an original reference signal, which is usually unavailable
in network monitoring, thus limiting its applicability. NISQA is a new
non-intrusive neural-network-based speech quality measure, focusing on
super-wideband speech signals. In this work, however, we aim at predicting the
well-known PESQ metric using a non-intrusive PESQ-DNN model. We illustrate the
potential of this model by predicting the PESQ scores of wideband-coded speech
obtained from AMR-WB or EVS codecs operating at different bitrates in noisy,
tandeming, and error-prone transmission conditions. We compare our methods with
the state-of-the-art network topologies of QualityNet, WaweNet, and DNSMOS --

exotic quantum systems remains limited. In this work, we present a general
theoretical framework of the MIM response of arbitrary quantum materials within
linear response theory. As a special case, we model the microwave response of
topological edge states in a Chern insulator and predict an enhanced MIM
response at the crystal boundaries due to collective edge magnetoplasmon (EMP)
excitations. The resonance frequency of these plasmonic modes should depend
quantitatively on the topological invariant of the Chern insulator state and on
the sample's circumference, which highlights their non-local, topological
nature. To benchmark our analytical predictions, we experimentally probe the
MIM response of quantum anomalous Hall edge states in a Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3
topological insulator and perform numerical simulations using a classical
formulation of the EMP modes based on this realistic tip-sample geometry, both
of which yield results consistent with our theoretical picture. We also show
how the technique of MIM can be used to quantitatively extract the topological
invariant of a Chern insulator, disentangle the signatures of topological

endows the hyper-reduced order model (hROM) with a nonlinear stability
property. The new method poses the discrete empirical interpolation method
(DEIM) as a minimization problem and subsequently imposes constraints to
conserve kinetic energy. Two methods are proposed to improve the robustness of
the new method against error accumulation: oversampling and Mahalanobis
regularization. Mahalanobis regularization has the benefit of not requiring
additional measurement points. Furthermore, a novel method is proposed to
perform structure-preserving temporal localization with the principle interval
decomposition: new interface conditions are derived such that energy and
momentum are conserved for a full time-integration instead of only during
separate intervals. The performance of the new structure-preserving
hyper-reduction methods and the structure-preserving temporal localization
method is analysed using two convection-dominated test cases; a shear-layer
roll-up and two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. It is found that
both Mahalanobis regularization and oversampling allow hyper-reduction of these

is increasing, especially as new, more complex data types become available to
analyze. By systematically examining the published literature, this review aims
to uncover potential gaps in the current use of ML to study MH in vulnerable
populations of immigrants, refugees, migrants, and racial and ethnic
minorities.
  Methods: In this systematic review, we queried Google Scholar for ML-related
terms, MH-related terms, and a population of a focus search term strung
together with Boolean operators. Backward reference searching was also
conducted. Included peer-reviewed studies reported using a method or
application of ML in an MH context and focused on the populations of interest.
We did not have date cutoffs. Publications were excluded if they were narrative
or did not exclusively focus on a minority population from the respective
country. Data including study context, the focus of mental healthcare, sample,
data type, type of ML algorithm used, and algorithm performance was extracted
from each.
  Results: Our search strategies resulted in 67,410 listed articles from Google
Scholar. Ultimately, 12 were included. All the articles were published within
the last 6 years, and half of them studied populations within the US. Most
reviewed studies used supervised learning to explain or predict MH outcomes.
Some publications used up to 16 models to determine the best predictive power.
Almost half of the included publications did not discuss their cross-validation
method.
  Conclusions: The included studies provide proof-of-concept for the potential
use of ML algorithms to address MH concerns in these special populations, few
as they may be. Our systematic review finds that the clinical application of
these models for classifying and predicting MH disorders is still under
development.

For the case where ParaOpt's cheap, coarse-grained propagator is linear, we
introduce diagonalization-based preconditioners inspired by recent advances in
the ParaDiag family of methods. These preconditioners not only lead to a
weakly-scalable ParaOpt version, but are themselves invertible in parallel,
making maximal use of available concurrency. They have proven convergence

Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), were used to obtain high acquisition
rates and signal-to-noise ratios. The light curves were also used to
characterize the Q1R ring (radial profiles and orbital elements). Results.
Quaoar's elliptical fit to the occultation chords yields the limb with an
apparent semi-major axis of $579.5\pm4.0$ km, apparent oblateness of
$0.12\pm0.01$, and area-equivalent radius of $543\pm2$ km. Quaoar's limb
orientation is consistent with Q1R and Weywot orbiting in Quaoar's equatorial
plane. The orbital radius of Q1R is refined to a value of $4,057\pm6$ km. The
radial opacity profile of the more opaque ring profile follows a Lorentzian
shape that extends over 60 km, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
$\sim5$ km and a peak normal optical depth of 0.4. Besides the secondary events
related to the already reported rings, new secondary events detected during the
August 2022 occultation in three different data sets are consistent with
another ring around Quaoar with a radius of $2,520\pm20$ km, assuming the ring
is circular and co-planar with Q1R. This new ring has a typical width of 10 km
and a normal optical depth of $\sim$0.004. Like Q1R, it also lies outside
Quaoar's classical Roche limit.

autonomic nervous system (ANS) was repurposed in mammals, via a second vagal
nerve, to suppress defensive strategies and support the expression of
sociality. Three critical assumptions of this theory are that (1) the
transition of the ANS was associated with the evolution of social mammals from
asocial reptiles; (2) the transition enabled mammals, unlike their reptilian
ancestors, to derive a biological benefit from social interactions; and (3) the
transition forces a less parsimonious explanation (convergence) for the
evolution of social behavior in birds and mammals, since birds evolved from a
reptilian lineage. Two recently published reviews, however, provided compelling
evidence that the social asocial dichotomy is overly simplistic, neglects the
diversity of vertebrate social systems, impedes our understanding of the
evolution of social behavior, and perpetuates the erroneous belief that one
group, non-avian reptiles, is incapable of complex social behavior. In the
worst case, if PT depends upon a transition from asocial reptiles to social
mammals, then the ability of PT to explain the evolution of the mammalian ANS
is highly questionable. A great number of social behaviors occur in both
reptiles and mammals. In the best case, PT has misused the terms social and
asocial. Even here, however, the theory would still need to identify a
particular suite of behaviors found in mammals and not reptiles that could be
associated with, or explain, the transition of the ANS, and then replace the
asocial and social labels with more specific descriptors.

situation exists on coffee farms in Puerto Rico in which three ant species, at
least on some farms, form an intransitive competitive triplet, and that triplet

approach might not be the optimal method even though the estimator exhibits
uniform convergence to the true cross-correlation. Instead, we show that there
exists a large class of simple non-linear functions that can be used to
construct cross-correlators with a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To
demonstrate this, we first present a general mathematical framework using
Price's Theorem that allows us to analyze cross-correlators constructed using a
mixture of piece-wise linear functions. Using this framework and
high-dimensional embedding, we show that some of the most promising
cross-correlators are based on Huber's loss functions, margin-propagation (MP)

which are distorted by the AUV's altitude, target's range and sensor's
resolution. As a result, the same physical area can show significant visual
differences in SSS images from different survey lines, causing difficulties in
tasks such as pixel correspondence and template matching. In this paper, a
canonical transformation method consisting of intensity correction and slant
range correction is proposed to decrease the above distortion. The intensity
correction includes beam pattern correction and incident angle correction using
three different Lambertian laws (cos, cos2, cot), whereas the slant range
correction removes the nadir zone and projects the position of SSS elements
into equally horizontally spaced, view-point independent bins. The proposed
method is evaluated on real data collected by a HUGIN AUV, with
manually-annotated pixel correspondence as ground truth reference. Experimental
results on patch pairs compare similarity measures and keypoint descriptor

Time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy can disentangle such obscurants

putative room-temperature EI where electron-lattice coupling dominates the

photoexcitation and exhibits a BEC-like temperature dependence. This occurs
well below the $T_{c}$, suggesting a novel approach to monitor exciton
condensate dynamics. Nonetheless, dynamic condensate-phonon coupling remains as
evidenced by peaks in the enhanced reflectivity spectrum at select

enhancement arises from phonon squeezing, validated using Fresnel-Floquet

extremely short quasar lifetimes $(t_Q\lesssim10^5 \text{ yrs})$. However,
these estimates of quasar lifetimes rely on the assumption that the observed
luminosities of the quasars are intrinsic and not magnified by gravitational
lensing, which would bias the lifetime estimates towards younger ages. In order
to test possible effects of gravitational lensing, we obtain high-resolution
images of the seven quasars with the {\em Hubble Space Telescope (HST)} and
look for signs of strong lensing. We do not find any evidence of strong
lensing, i.e., all quasars are well-described by point sources, and no
foreground lensing galaxy is detected. We estimate that the strong lensing
probabilities for these quasars are extremely small $(\sim1.4\times10^{-5})$,
and show that weak lensing changes the estimated quasar lifetimes by only
$\lesssim0.2$ dex. We thus confirm that the short lifetimes of these quasars
are intrinsic. The existence of young quasars indicates a high obscured

valuable information regarding the ISM properties, stellar populations, galaxy

the power of this approach by applying our line emission model to the publicly

$1\sigma$ agreement with ALMA/JWST measurements after accounting for the
inhomogeneities in ISM properties. We also quantitatively validate the one-zone

The risk of undetected breast cancer increases with the amount of glandular
tissue in the breast. Therefore, radiologists need to know quantitative
glandular fraction when diagnosing a patient. Another increasingly popular
mammography protocol is eliminating the anti-scatter grid and using software
algorithms to reduce scatter. This work uses a Maximum Likelihood Expectation
Maximization algorithm to estimate the pixel-wise glandular fraction from
images taken with an anti-scatter grid or with scatter removed algorithmically.
The work also studies if presenting the pixel-wise glandular fraction image
alongside the usual mammography image has the potential to improve
micro-calcification detection. Approach: The algorithms are implemented and
evaluated with TOPAS Geant4-generated images with known glandular fractions.
These images are also taken with and without microcalcifications present to
study the effects of GF-estimation on microcalcification detection. We then
applied the algorithm to a few clinical DICOM images with and without
microcalcifications. Results: For the TOPAS simulated images, the glandular
fraction was estimated with a root mean squared error of 3.2% and 2.5% for the
without and with anti-scatter grid cases. Results from DICOM clinical images
(where the proper glandular fraction is unknown) show that the algorithm gives
a glandular fraction within the average range expected from the literature. For
microcalcification detection, the contrast-to-noise ratio improved by 17.5-548%
in DICOM images and 5.1-88% in TOPAS images. Significance: This work studied
the accuracy of maximum likelihood estimation for a glandular fraction on
simulated and clinical images and shows an improvement in contrast to noise
ratio for detecting microcalcifications, a risk factor in breast cancer.

Diffusion MRI (dMRI) allows non-invasive estimation of axon radius, but
accurately estimating the radius of axons in the human brain is challenging.
Most axons in the brain have a radius below one micrometre, which falls below
the sensitivity limit of dMRI signals even when using the most advanced human
MRI scanners. Therefore, new MRI methods that are sensitive to small axon radii
are needed. In this proof-of-concept investigation, we examine whether a
surface-based axonal relaxation process could mediate a relationship between
intra-axonal T2 and T1 times and inner axon radius, as measured using
postmortem histology. A unique in vivo human diffusion-T1-T2 relaxation dataset
was acquired on a 3T MRI scanner with ultra-strong diffusion gradients, using a
strong diffusion-weighting (i.e., b=6000 s/mm2) and multiple inversion and echo
times. A second reduced diffusion-T2 dataset was collected at various echo
times to evaluate the model further. The intra-axonal relaxation times were
estimated by fitting a diffusion-relaxation model to the orientation-averaged
spherical mean signals. Our analysis revealed that the proposed surface-based
relaxation model effectively explains the relationship between the estimated
relaxation times and the histological axon radius measured in various corpus

combination of properties is often warranted. To achieve that it is crucial to
find out the optimum recipe or processing conditions that can generate the
ideal combination of these properties. Most of the time, a sufficient number of
experiments are needed to generate a Pareto front. However, manufacturing
experiments are usually costly and even conducting a single experiment can be a
time-consuming process. So, it's critical to determine the optimal location for
data collection to gain the most comprehensive understanding of the process.
Sequential learning is a promising approach to actively learn from the ongoing
experiments, iteratively update the underlying optimization routine, and adapt
the data collection process on the go. This paper presents a novel data-driven
Bayesian optimization framework that utilizes sequential learning to
efficiently optimize complex systems with multiple conflicting objectives.
Additionally, this paper proposes a novel metric for evaluating multi-objective
data-driven optimization approaches. This metric considers both the quality of
the Pareto front and the amount of data used to generate it. The proposed
framework is particularly beneficial in practical applications where acquiring
data can be expensive and resource intensive. To demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed algorithm and metric, the algorithm is evaluated on a
manufacturing dataset. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can
achieve the actual Pareto front while processing significantly less data. It
implies that the proposed data-driven framework can lead to similar

neuron experience synchronous synaptic inputs is exceedingly low. While the
models of asynchronous neurons lead to observed spiking variability, it is not
clear whether the asynchronous state can also account for the level of
subthreshold membrane potential variability. We propose a new analytical
framework to rigorously quantify the subthreshold variability of a single
conductance-based neuron in response to synaptic inputs with prescribed degrees
of synchrony. Technically we leverage the theory of exchangeability to model
input synchrony via jump-process-based synaptic drives; we then perform a
moment analysis of the stationary response of a neuronal model with all-or-none
conductances that neglects post-spiking reset. As a result, we produce exact,
interpretable closed forms for the first two stationary moments of the membrane
voltage, with explicit dependence on the input synaptic numbers, strengths, and
synchrony. For biophysically relevant parameters, we find that the asynchronous
regime only yields realistic subthreshold variability (voltage variance $\simeq
4-9\mathrm{mV^2}$) when driven by a restricted number of large synapses,
compatible with strong thalamic drive. By contrast, we find that achieving
realistic subthreshold variability with dense cortico-cortical inputs requires
including weak but nonzero input synchrony, consistent with measured pairwise
spiking correlations.

clinical applications (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), Mechanical
thrombectomy techniques for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), or Transjugular
intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS)). All procedures commonly require 3D
vessel geometries from 3D CTA (Computed Tomography Angiography) images. During
these procedures, the clinician generally places a guiding catheter in the
ostium of the relevant vessel and then manipulates a wire through the catheter
and across the blockage. The clinician only uses X-ray fluoroscopy
intermittently to visualize and guide the catheter, guidewire, and other
devices. However, clinicians still passively control guidewires/catheters by
relying on limited indirect observation (i.e., 2D partial view of devices, and
intermittent updates due to radiation limit) from X-ray fluoroscopy. Modeling
and controlling the guidewire manipulation in coronary vessels remains
challenging because of the complicated interaction between guidewire motions
with different physical properties (i.e., loads, coating) and vessel geometries
with lumen conditions resulting in a highly non-linear system. This paper
introduces a scalable learning pipeline to train AI-based agent models toward
automated endovascular predictive device controls. First, we create a scalable
environment by pre-processing 3D CTA images, providing patient-specific 3D
vessel geometry and the centerline of the coronary. Next, we apply a large
quantity of randomly generated motion sequences from the proximal end to
generate wire states associated with each environment using a physics-based
device simulator. Then, we reformulate the control problem to a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem, in which we use a Transformer-based

the proximity of the time-evolution to a non-thermal fixed point. We find
universal dynamics connected with rogue-wave like events in the mutually

random potential. The frequency of these caustics is affected by the time
varying spatial correlation length of the potential, giving rise to an
additional exponent $\delta_\mathrm{c} \simeq 1/3$ for temporal scaling, which
is different by a factor $\sim 4/3$ from the exponent $\beta_V \simeq 1/4$

events to occur scale in time as $t^{\, \delta_\mathrm{I}}$. This suggests that
the universality class of a non-thermal fixed point could be characterized by
different, mutually related exponents defining the coarsening evolution in time

resulted from accretion of Corotating Interaction Region (CIR) material. A
common spectral model to HMXBs, powerlaw with high energy cutoff and absorption
at low energy, gave a good fit to both flaring and quiescent states. A
flourescent iron line was not required in fitting any of the states. On the

bioinformatics, clinical data, and ecological studies, where collecting
negative samples can be prohibitively expensive. While prior works on PU data
focus on binary classification, in this paper we consider multiple positive
labels, a practically important and common setting. We introduce a
multinomial-PU model and an ordinal-PU model, suited to unordered and ordered
labels respectively. We propose proximal gradient descent-based algorithms to
minimize the l_{1,2}-penalized log-likelihood losses, with convergence
guarantees to stationary points of the non-convex objective. Despite the
challenging non-convexity induced by the presence-only data and multi-class
labels, we prove statistical error bounds for the stationary points within a
neighborhood around the true parameters under the high-dimensional regime. This
is made possible through a careful characterization of the landscape of the
log-likelihood loss in the neighborhood. In addition, simulations and two real
data experiments demonstrate the empirical benefits of our algorithms compared
to the baseline methods.

Comets II and are considered alongside the traditional methods of studying
nuclei remotely. We use the results from recent in situ missions, notably
Rosetta, to put the collective properties obtained by remote observations into

prevalence of highly elongated and/or bilobate shapes. We also explore how
nucleus properties evolve, focusing on fragmentation and the likely related

$\tau$-regression estimator for analyzing high-dimensional data sets subject to
gross contamination in the response variables and covariates. We call the
resulting estimator adaptive $\tau$-Lasso that is robust to outliers and
high-leverage points and simultaneously employs adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty
term to reduce the bias associated with large true regression coefficients.
More specifically, this adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term assigns a weight to
each regression coefficient. For a fixed number of predictors $p$, we show that
the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso has the oracle property with respect to
variable-selection consistency and asymptotic normality for the regression
vector corresponding to the true support, assuming knowledge of the true
regression vector support. We then characterize its robustness via the
finite-sample breakdown point and the influence function. We carry-out
extensive simulations to compare the performance of the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso
estimator with that of other competing regularized estimators in terms of
prediction and variable selection accuracy in the presence of contamination
within the response vector/regression matrix and additive heavy-tailed noise.
We observe from our simulations that the class of $\tau$-Lasso estimators
exhibits robustness and reliable performance in both contaminated and
uncontaminated data settings, achieving the best or close-to-best for many
scenarios, except for oracle estimators. However, it is worth noting that no
particular estimator uniformly dominates others. We also validate our findings

been introduced to learn nuance features from RS for binary classifications and
achieved outstanding performance than conventional machine learning methods.
However, these existing deep learning methods still confront some challenges in
classifying subtypes of CVD. For example, the nuance between subtypes is quite
hard to capture and represent by intelligent models due to the chillingly
similar shape of RS sequences. Moreover, medical history information is an
essential resource for distinguishing subtypes, but they are underutilized. In
light of this, we propose a multi-modality multi-scale model called M3S, which
is a novel deep learning method with two core modules to address these issues.
First, we convert RS data to various resolution images by the Gramian angular
field (GAF) to enlarge nuance, and a two-branch structure is leveraged to get
embeddings for distinction in the multi-scale feature extraction module.
Second, a probability matrix and a weight matrix are used to enhance the
classification capacity by combining the RS and medical history data in the
multi-modality data fusion module. We perform extensive evaluations of M3S and
found its outstanding performance on our in-house dataset, with accuracy,

  Purpose: To test SAM's accuracy in various medical image segmentation tasks
and investigate potential factors that may affect its accuracy in medical

  Methods: SAM was tested on 12 public medical image segmentation datasets
involving 7,451 subjects. The accuracy was measured by the Dice overlap between
the algorithm-segmented and ground-truth masks. SAM was compared with five
state-of-the-art algorithms specifically designed for medical image
segmentation tasks. Associations of SAM's accuracy with six factors were
computed, independently and jointly, including segmentation difficulties as
measured by segmentation ability score and by Dice overlap in U-Net, image

relatively large between non-streaming and a full-contextual model trained
independently. To address this, we propose a dynamic chunk-based convolution
replacing the causal convolution in a hybrid Connectionist Temporal
Classification (CTC)-Attention Conformer architecture. Additionally, we
demonstrate further improvements through initialization of weights from a
full-contextual model and parallelization of the convolution and self-attention
modules. We evaluate our models on the open-source Voxpopuli, LibriSpeech and
in-house conversational datasets. Overall, our proposed model reduces the
degradation of the streaming mode over the non-streaming full-contextual model
from 41.7% and 45.7% to 16.7% and 26.2% on the LibriSpeech test-clean and
test-other datasets respectively, while improving by a relative 15.5% WER over
the previous state-of-the-art unified model.

prove that classic sequential algorithms for this problem are

encounter memory contention $O(T^2 \cdot \log |V| \cdot \log |E|)$ times in

main mechanisms: breaching, which refers to the retrogressive failure of a
steep slope forming a turbidity current, and, instantaneous sliding wedges,
known as shear failure, that also contribute to shape the morphology of the
soil deposit. Although there are several modes of failures, in this paper we
investigate breaching and shear failures of granular columns using the
two-fluid approach. The numerical model is first applied to simulate small
scale granular column collapses with different initial volume fractions to
study the role of the initial conditions on the main flow dynamics. For loosely
packed granular columns, the porous medium initially contracts and the
resulting positive pore pressure leads to a rapid collapse. Whereas in
initially dense-packing columns, the porous medium initially dilates and
negative pore pressure is generated stabilizing the granular column, which
results in a slow collapse. The proposed numerical approach shows good
agreement with the experimental data in terms of morphology and excess of pore
pressure. Numerical results are extended to a large-scale application known as
the breaching process. This phenomenon may occur naturally at coasts or on
dykes and levees in rivers but it can also be triggered by humans during
dredging operations. The results indicate that the two-phase flow model
correctly predicts the dilative behavior and, the subsequent turbidity
currents, associated to the breaching process.

effect which can both enable and impede optical processes in guided wave
systems. Highly multi-mode excitation of fibers has been proposed as a novel
route towards efficient suppression of SBS in both active and passive fibers.
To study the effects of multimode excitation generally, we develop a theory of
SBS for arbitrary input excitations, fiber cross section geometries and
refractive index profiles. We derive appropriate nonlinear coupled mode
equations for the signal and Stokes modal amplitudes starting from vector
optical and tensor acoustic equations. Using applicable approximations, we find
an analytical formula for the SBS (Stokes) gain susceptibility, which takes
into account the vector nature of both optical and acoustic modes exactly. We
show that upon multimode excitation, the SBS power in each Stokes mode grows
exponentially with a growth rate that depends parametrically on the
distribution of power in the signal modes. Specializing to isotropic fibers we
are able to define and calculate an effective SBS gain spectrum for any choice
of multimode excitation. The peak value of this gain spectrum determines the
SBS threshold, the maximum SBS-limited power that can be sent through the
fiber. We show theoretically that peak SBS gain is greatly reduced by highly
multimode excitation due to gain broadening and relatively weaker intermodal
SBS gain. We demonstrate that equal excitation of the 160 modes of a
commercially available, highly multimode circular step index fiber raises the
SBS threshold by a factor of 6.5, and find comparable suppression of SBS in
similar fibers with a D-shaped cross-section.

soilborne fungus Fusarium oxysporum, F. oxy. Our sensitivity study assesses the
model's accuracy in long-distance aerosol transport and the impact of
deposition rate on long-distance spore transport in Summer 2020 during a major
dust transport event from Northern Sub-Saharan Africa to the Caribbean and
southeastern U.S. We find that decreasing wet and dry deposition rates by an
order of magnitude improves representation of long distance, trans-Atlantic
dust transport. Simulations also suggest that a small number of viable spores
can survive trans-Atlantic transport to be deposited in agricultural zones.
This number is dependent on source spore parameterization, which we improved
through a literature search to yield a global map of F. oxy spore distribution
in source agricultural soils. Using this map and aerosol transport modeling, we
show how viable spore numbers in the atmosphere decrease with distance traveled
and offer a novel danger index for viable spore deposition in agricultural
zones.

real-life applications. Therefore, we address the problem of domain
generalization for semantic segmentation tasks to reduce the need to acquire
and label additional data. Recent work on domain generalization increase data
diversity by varying domain-variant features such as colour, style and texture
in images. However, excessive stylization or even uniform stylization may
reduce performance. Performance reduction is especially pronounced for pixels
from minority classes, which are already more challenging to classify compared
to pixels from majority classes. Therefore, we introduce a module, $ASH_{+}$,
that modulates stylization strength for each pixel depending on the pixel's
semantic content. In this work, we also introduce a parameter that balances the
element-wise and channel-wise proportion of stylized features with the original
source domain features in the stylized source domain images. This learned
parameter replaces an empirically determined global hyperparameter, allowing
for more fine-grained control over the output stylized image. We conduct
multiple experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
Finally, we evaluate our model on the publicly available benchmark semantic
segmentation datasets (Cityscapes and SYNTHIA). Quantitative and qualitative
comparisons indicate that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art.

case of no resetting where the cost is always zero. For the case of an
exponentially increasing cost function we show that the mean cost diverges at a
finite resetting rate. We explain this by showing that the distribution of the

to maximal yield of that target. Initial experiments are selected based on
thermochemical data collected from first principles calculations, which enable
the identification of precursors exhibiting large thermodynamic force to form

reaction paths are determined by sampling a range of synthesis temperatures and
identifying their products. ARROWS3 then uses this information to pinpoint
which intermediate reactions consume most of the available free energy

precursors are selected to avoid such unfavorable reactions and therefore
maintain a strong driving force to form the target. We validate this approach
on three experimental datasets containing results from more than 200 distinct

the LHCb searched for this contribution but reported no evidence. Purpose:
$\overline D$ meson and $J/\psi$ production is calculated for the SMOG
fixed-target configuration in the LHCb experiment using a combination of
perturbative QCD and intrinsic charm to see whether intrinsic chaarm would
indeed be observable in the SMOG kinematics. Methods: Open charm and $J/\psi$
production is calculated to next-to-leading order in perturbative QCD. Because
a gas jet nuclear target is used, cold nuclear matter effects are included in
the perturbative calculations. The intrinsic charm is calculated assuming
production from a $|uud c \overline c \rangle$ Fock state. Results: The
differential rapidity and transverse momentum distributions in $p+{\rm Ne}$,
$p+{\rm He}$ and $p+{\rm Ar}$ fixed-target interactions are calculated in the
SMOG acceptance and compared to data. The predicted asymmetries between
$\overline D$ (leading charm) and $D$ (nonleading charm) are also shown.
Conclusions: The contribution from intrinisic charm is small and decreases with
center of mass energy. The calculations agree well with the current SMOG data,
with or without intrinsic charm.

behavior with a broad anomaly around 150{200 K that is also observed in the

charge-density-wave (CDW) fluctuations, where the lack of long-range order is
caused by vacancies at the Ni site of Ni0:85V2Se4. Although we fail to observe
any structural distortion in this crystal down to 1.5 K, its electronic and

three common models of generalization to novel views: (i) full 3D

but they do so in a way that differs from all these existing models.
Extrapolation to views beyond the range covered by views in the training set is
limited, and extrapolation to novel rotation axes is even more limited,
implying that the networks do not infer full 3D structure, nor use linear
interpolation. Yet, generalization is far superior to pure 2D matching. These
findings help with designing datasets with 2D views required to achieve 3D

recipients in the network. In network-based studies, outcomes may be missing
due to the administrative end of a study or participants being lost to
follow-up due to study dropout, also known as censoring. We propose an inverse
probability censoring weighted (IPCW) estimator, which is an extension of an
IPW estimator for network-based observational studies to settings where the
outcome is subject to possible censoring. We demonstrated that the proposed
estimator was consistent and asymptotically normal. We also derived a
closed-form estimator of the asymptotic variance estimator. We used the IPCW
estimator to quantify the spillover effects in a network-based study of a
nonrandomized intervention with censoring of the outcome. A simulation study
was conducted to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the IPCW estimators.
The simulation study demonstrated that the estimator performed well in finite
samples when the sample size and number of connected subnetworks (components)

Specifically, we first generate a set of multiscale images and feed them into a
coarse-fusion network to exploit the contextual texture correlation.
Thereafter, a fine fusion network is followed to exchange the information
across the parallel multiscale subnetworks. Furthermore, we design a
co-attention fusion module to adaptively emphasize informative features from
different scales, and thereby enhance the discriminative learning capability

develop a large-signal linear MG model that considers the detailed dynamics of
the primary and zero-control levels based on the Koopman operator (KO) theory.
Firstly, a set of observable functions is carefully designed to capture the
nonlinear dynamics of the MG. The corresponding linear KO is then analytically
derived based on these observables, resulting in the linear representation of
the original nonlinear MG with observables as the new coordinate. The influence
of external input on the system dynamics is also considered during the
derivation, enabling control of the MG. We solve the voltage control problem
using the traditional linear quadratic integrator (LQI) method to demonstrate
that textbook linear control techniques can accurately control the original
nonlinear MG via the developed KO linearized MG model. Our proposed KO
linearization method is generic and can be easily extended for different
control objectives and MG structures using our analytical derivation procedure.

his party). We argue that pack-and-pair districting, where weaker districts are
``packed'' with a single type of voter, while stronger districts contain two
voter types, is typically optimal for the gerrymanderer. The optimal form of
pack-and-pair districting depends on the relative amounts of aggregate and
idiosyncratic uncertainty. When idiosyncratic uncertainty dominates, it is
optimal to pack opposing voters and pair more favorable voters; this plan
resembles traditional ``packing-and-cracking.'' When aggregate uncertainty
dominates, it is optimal to pack moderate voters and pair extreme voters; this
``matching slices'' plan has received some attention in the literature.
Estimating the model using precinct-level returns from recent US House
elections indicates that, in practice, idiosyncratic uncertainty dominates and
packing opponents is optimal; moreover, traditional pack-and-crack districting
is approximately optimal. We discuss implications for redistricting reform and
political polarization. Methodologically, we exploit a formal connection

design -- partitioning states of the world into signals.

Furthermore, we show that parameter search for geometrically generalized

neural machine translation (MNMT) models into smaller ones are practically
nonexistent, despite the popularity and superiority of MNMT. This paper bridges
this gap by presenting an empirical investigation of knowledge distillation for
compressing MNMT models. We take Indic to English translation as a case study
and demonstrate that commonly used language-agnostic and language-aware KD
approaches yield models that are 4-5x smaller but also suffer from performance
drops of up to 3.5 BLEU. To mitigate this, we then experiment with design
considerations such as shallower versus deeper models, heavy parameter sharing,
multi-stage training, and adapters. We observe that deeper compact models tend
to be as good as shallower non-compact ones, and that fine-tuning a distilled
model on a High-Quality subset slightly boosts translation quality. Overall, we
conclude that compressing MNMT models via KD is challenging, indicating immense
scope for further research.

complicated problem partitioning and dataset pre-processing. With the current
AI-driven trend of having thousands of interconnected processors per chip,
there is an opportunity to re-think these communication-bottlenecked workloads.
This bottleneck often arises from the data structure traversals, which cause
irregular memory access patterns and poor cache locality.
  Recent works have introduced task-based parallelization schemes to accelerate
graph traversal and other sparse workloads. Of these, Dalorex demonstrated high
scalability by having the entire dataset on-chip, scattered across processing
units (PU), and executing the tasks at the PU where the data is local. However,
the communication needs of this approach do not scale with system sizes beyond
10k cores, and both the ability to handle larger datasets and how to achieve a
cost-efficient design for production remain unanswered.
  To address these challenges, we propose a throughput-aware scalable chiplet
architecture for distributed execution (Tascade), a multi-node system design
that we evaluate with up to 256 distributed chips, a total of 1 million PUs. We
introduce a programming model that scales to this level through proxy regions
and selective cascading that reduce communication needs and improve load
balancing. In addition, package-time reconfiguration of our large-scale chip
design enables creating chip products that optimize for different target
metrics, such as time-to-solution, energy, or cost.
  We evaluate six applications and four datasets, with several configurations
and memory technologies to provide a detailed analysis of the performance,
power, and cost of data-local execution at scale. Our parallelization of
Breadth-First-Search with RMAT-26 across a million PUs, the largest of the

reinforcement learning, called H-TSP, for addressing the large-scale Travelling
Salesman Problem (TSP). The proposed H-TSP constructs a solution of a TSP
instance starting from the scratch relying on two components: the upper-level
policy chooses a small subset of nodes (up to 200 in our experiment) from all
nodes that are to be traversed, while the lower-level policy takes the chosen
nodes as input and outputs a tour connecting them to the existing partial route
(initially only containing the depot). After jointly training the upper-level
and lower-level policies, our approach can directly generate solutions for the
given TSP instances without relying on any time-consuming search procedures. To
demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have conducted extensive
experiments on randomly generated TSP instances with different numbers of
nodes. We show that H-TSP can achieve comparable results (gap 3.42% vs. 7.32%)
as SOTA search-based approaches, and more importantly, we reduce the time
consumption up to two orders of magnitude (3.32s vs. 395.85s). To the best of
our knowledge, H-TSP is the first end-to-end deep reinforcement learning
approach that can scale to TSP instances of up to 10000 nodes. Although there
are still gaps to SOTA results with respect to solution quality, we believe
that H-TSP will be useful for practical applications, particularly those that
are time-sensitive e.g., on-call routing and ride hailing service.

gravitational waveform model developed for compact binary systems, many ($\sim

and post-merge parameters were compared. In the models, it is assumed that the
initial total mass (M$_{\rm{tot}}$) of the binary systems varies between 12-130
$\rm{M}_\odot$ with step interval 1$\rm{M}_\odot$, the mass ratios ($q =
\rm{m}_{1i}/\rm{m}_{2i}$) vary between 1 and 2 with step interval 0.004, and
the initial spin ($\abs{\rchi_{1i}} = \abs{\rchi_{2i}}$) value varies between

fractional mass loss (M$_{FL}$), and the maximum gravitational wave amplitude

$\rchi_{\rm{f}}$ between 0.29 and 0.91. In most of the BBHs we have modeled, we

that M$_{\rm{FL}}$ values are not always inversely varied to the $q$ parameter

(M-MAC), where the primary and secondary signals are superposed in a
multiplicative and additive manner. To pursue the fundamental performance
limits of the M-MAC, we focus on the characterization of the capacity region of
such systems. Due to the passive nature of RISs, the transmitted signal of the
RIS should satisfy the peak power constraint. Under this constraint at the RIS
as well as the average power constraint at the primary transmitter (PTx), we
analyze the capacity-achieving distributions of the transmitted signals and
characterize the capacity region of the M-MAC. Then, theoretical analysis is
performed to reveal insights into the RIS-assisted SR. It is observed that: 1)
the capacity region of the M-MAC is strictly convex and larger than that of the
conventional TDMA scheme; 2) the secondary transmission can achieve the maximum
rate when the PTx transmits the constant envelope signals; 3) and the sum rate
can achieve the maximum when the PTx transmits Gaussian signals and the RIS
transmits the constant envelope signals. Finally, extensive numerical results

significantly more resources compared to standard training and trades off
accuracy for robustness. An inspiring recent work [Dapello et al.] aims to
bring neurobiological tools to the question: How can we develop Neural Nets
that robustly generalize like human vision? [Dapello et al.] design a network
structure with a neural hidden first layer that mimics the primate primary
visual cortex (V1), followed by a back-end structure adapted from current CNN
vision models. It seems to achieve non-trivial adversarial robustness on
standard vision benchmarks when tested on small perturbations. Here we revisit
this biologically inspired work, and ask whether a principled parameter-free
representation with inspiration from physics is able to achieve the same goal.
We discover that the wavelet scattering transform can replace the complex
V1-cortex and simple uniform Gaussian noise can take the role of neural
stochasticity, to achieve adversarial robustness. In extensive experiments on
the CIFAR-10 benchmark with adaptive adversarial attacks we show that: 1)
Robustness of VOneBlock architectures is relatively weak (though non-zero) when
the strength of the adversarial attack radius is set to commonly used
benchmarks. 2) Replacing the front-end VOneBlock by an off-the-shelf
parameter-free Scatternet followed by simple uniform Gaussian noise can achieve
much more substantial adversarial robustness without adversarial training. Our
work shows how physically inspired structures yield new insights into
robustness that were previously only thought possible by meticulously mimicking
the human cortex.

  Traveling Salesman Problem","Accepted by AAAI 2023, February 2023",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), as a classic routing optimization problem
originally arising in the domain of transportation and logistics, has become a
critical task in broader domains, such as manufacturing and biology. Recently,
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been increasingly employed to solve TSP
due to its high inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most of existing end-to-end
DRL algorithms only perform well on small TSP instances and can hardly
generalize to large scale because of the drastically soaring memory consumption
and computation time along with the enlarging problem scale. In this paper, we
propose a novel end-to-end DRL approach, referred to as Pointerformer, based on
multi-pointer Transformer. Particularly, Pointerformer adopts both reversible
residual network in the encoder and multi-pointer network in the decoder to
effectively contain memory consumption of the encoder-decoder architecture. To
further improve the performance of TSP solutions, Pointerformer employs both a
feature augmentation method to explore the symmetries of TSP at both training
and inference stages as well as an enhanced context embedding approach to
include more comprehensive context information in the query. Extensive
experiments on a randomly generated benchmark and a public benchmark have shown
that, while achieving comparative results on most small-scale TSP instances as
SOTA DRL approaches do, Pointerformer can also well generalize to large-scale
TSPs.

lifetimes despite their low optical gaps (~1.4 eV), thus allowing organic solar
cells (OSCs) to achieve highly efficient charge generation with extended
near-infrared (NIR) absorption range (up to ~1000 nm). However, the precise
molecular-level mechanism that enables low-energy excited states in Y6-type
acceptors to achieve nanosecond lifetimes has remained elusive. Here, we
demonstrate that the distinct packing of Y6 molecules in film leads to a strong
intermolecular charge-transfer (iCT) character of the lowest excited state in
Y6 aggregates, which is absent in other low-gap acceptors such as ITIC. Due to
strong electronic couplings between the adjacent Y6 molecules, the iCT-exciton
energies are greatly reduced by up to ~0.25 eV with respect to excitons formed
in separated molecules. Importantly, despite their low energies, the iCT
excitons have reduced non-adiabatic electron-vibration couplings with the
electronic ground state, thus suppressing non-radiative recombination and
allowing Y6 to overcome the well-known energy gap law. Our results reveal the
fundamental relationship between molecular packing and nanosecond excited-state
lifetimes in NIR-absorbing Y6-type acceptors underlying the outstanding
performance of Y6-based OSCs.

  Social Media",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image manipulation detection algorithms designed to identify local anomalies
often rely on the manipulated regions being ``sufficiently'' different from the
rest of the non-tampered regions in the image. However, such anomalies might
not be easily identifiable in high-quality manipulations, and their use is
often based on the assumption that certain image phenomena are associated with
the use of specific editing tools. This makes the task of manipulation
detection hard in and of itself, with state-of-the-art detectors only being
able to detect a limited number of manipulation types. More importantly, in
cases where the anomaly assumption does not hold, the detection of false
positives in otherwise non-manipulated images becomes a serious problem.
  To understand the current state of manipulation detection, we present an
in-depth analysis of deep learning-based and learning-free methods, assessing
their performance on different benchmark datasets containing tampered and
non-tampered samples. We provide a comprehensive study of their suitability for
detecting different manipulations as well as their robustness when presented
with non-tampered data. Furthermore, we propose a novel deep learning-based
pre-processing technique that accentuates the anomalies present in manipulated
regions to make them more identifiable by a variety of manipulation detection
methods. To this end, we introduce an anomaly enhancement loss that, when used
with a residual architecture, improves the performance of different detection
algorithms with a minimal introduction of false positives on the
non-manipulated data.
  Lastly, we introduce an open-source manipulation detection toolkit comprising
a number of standard detection algorithms.

We demonstrate reasonable success in approximating solutions of this range of
parabolic, hyperbolic, and ODE primal problems, which includes energy

to a variational formulation. The scheme naturally associates a family of dual

attention, since it aims to transmit the meaning of information rather than
bit-by-bit transmission, thus enhancing data transmission efficiency and
supporting future human-centric, data-, and resource-intensive intelligent
services in 6G systems. Nevertheless, channel noises are common and even
serious in 6G-empowered scenarios, limiting the communication performance of
SemCom, especially when Signal-to-Noise (SNR) levels during training and
deployment stages are different, but training multi-networks to cover the
scenario with a broad range of SNRs is computationally inefficient. Hence, we
develop a novel De-Noising SemCom (DNSC) framework, where the designed
de-noiser module can eliminate noise interference from semantic vectors. Upon
the designed DNSC architecture, we further combine adversarial learning,
variational autoencoder, and diffusion model to propose the Latent Diffusion
DNSC (Latent-Diff DNSC) scheme to realize intelligent online de-noising. During
the offline training phase, noises are added to latent semantic vectors in a
forward Markov diffusion manner and then are eliminated in a reverse diffusion
manner through the posterior distribution approximated by the U-shaped Network
(U-Net), where the semantic de-noiser is optimized by maximizing evidence lower
bound (ELBO). Such design can model real noisy channel environments with
various SNRs and enable to adaptively remove noises from noisy semantic vectors
during the online transmission phase. The simulations on open-source image
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Latent-Diff DNSC scheme in
PSNR and SSIM over different SNRs than the state-of-the-art schemes, including
JPEG, Deep JSCC, and ADJSCC.

limitations: (1) ignore the inherent emotional information of the news, which
could be beneficial since it contains the subjective intentions of the authors;
(2) pay little attention to the relation (similarity) between the title and
textual information in news articles, which often use irrelevant title to
attract reader' attention. To this end, we propose a novel Title-Text
similarity and emotion-aware Fake news detection (TieFake) method by jointly
modeling the multi-modal context information and the author sentiment in a

learn the representations for text and images, and utilize publisher emotion

Adaptive Skinning Model (ASM), which redefines the skinning model with more

the additional advantage of model size and easy implementation for new

demonstrates the importance of a high-capacity model for fully exploiting
abundant information from multi-view input in reconstruction. Furthermore, our

semantic segmentation architectures where the features from the later stages
are used for classification. We can improve semantic segmentation models

This is challenged by some low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) and changing-look AGNs
(CLAGNs), which have steep Balmer decrement but without strong evidence for
absorption. We compile a sample of normal AGNs and CLAGNs with a wider
distribution of bolometric Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}=L_{\rm

decrement based on the photoionization model using the Cloudy code by
considering spectral energy distribution (SED) from the accretion disk with
different accretion rates (e.g., disk/corona and truncated disk at high and low
Eddington ratios, respectively). Both the standard disk and truncated disk
predict a negative correlation of $\rm H\alpha/H\beta-\lambda_{\rm Edd}$, where
the relation is steeper in the case of the truncated disk. The negative
correlations are also explored in two single CLAGNs. The measured negative
correlation of $\rm H\alpha/H\beta$ -- $\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ is mainly caused by
the lower responsivity $({\rm dlog}L_{\rm line}/{\rm dlog}L_{\rm cont})$ in
$\rm H\alpha$ relative to that in $\rm H\beta$, due to the larger optical depth
in the former. We propose that the steep Balmer decrements in

simply caused by absorption but mainly caused by the relatively low flux of

  Transmission",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, semantic communication has been widely applied in wireless image
transmission systems as it can prioritize the preservation of meaningful
semantic information in images over the accuracy of transmitted symbols,
leading to improved communication efficiency. However, existing semantic
communication approaches still face limitations in achieving considerable
inference performance in downstream AI tasks like image recognition, or
balancing the inference performance with the quality of the reconstructed image
at the receiver. Therefore, this paper proposes a contrastive learning
(CL)-based semantic communication approach to overcome these limitations.
Specifically, we regard the image corruption during transmission as a form of
data augmentation in CL and leverage CL to reduce the semantic distance between
the original and the corrupted reconstruction while maintaining the semantic
distance among irrelevant images for better discrimination in downstream tasks.
Moreover, we design a two-stage training procedure and the corresponding loss
functions for jointly optimizing the semantic encoder and decoder to achieve a
good trade-off between the performance of image recognition in the downstream
task and reconstructed quality. Simulations are finally conducted to
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the competitive
approaches. In particular, the proposed method can achieve up to 56\% accuracy
gain on the CIFAR10 dataset when the bandwidth compression ratio is 1/48.

large-scale GPU-based simulation of non-convex objects. Current GPU-based
simulators such as IsaacGym and Brax must trade-off speed with fidelity,
generality, or both when simulating non-convex objects. Their main issue lies
in contact detection (CD): existing CD algorithms, such as
Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK), must trade off their computational speed with
accuracy which becomes expensive as the number of collisions among non-convex
objects increases. We propose a data-driven approach for CD, whose accuracy
depends only on the quality and quantity of offline dataset rather than online
computation time. Unlike GJK, our method inherently has a uniform computational
flow, which facilitates efficient GPU usage based on advanced compilers such as
XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra). Further, we offer a data-efficient solution
by learning the patterns of colliding local crop object shapes, rather than
global object shapes which are harder to learn. We demonstrate our approach
improves the efficiency of existing CD methods by a factor of 5-10 for
non-convex objects with comparable accuracy. Using the previous work on contact
resolution for a neural-network-based contact detector, we integrate our CD
algorithm into the open-source GPU-based simulator, Brax, and show that we can
improve the efficiency over IsaacGym and generality over standard Brax. We

tool can improve the convergence rates of the subgradient-push and stochastic
gradient-push, two important algorithms for distributed convex optimization
over unbalanced directed graphs. Specifically, the paper proves that the
subgradient-push algorithm converges at a rate of $O(1/\sqrt{t})$ for general
convex functions and stochastic gradient-push algorithm converges at a rate of
$O(1/t)$ for strongly convex functions, over time-varying unbalanced directed

solve complex and computationally expensive multi-objective optimization
problems in recent years. However, when dealing with high-dimensional
optimization problems, the performance of these surrogate-assisted
multi-objective evolutionary algorithms deteriorate drastically. In this work,
a novel Classifier-assisted rank-based learning and Local Model based
multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm (CLMEA) is proposed for high-dimensional
expensive multi-objective optimization problems. The proposed algorithm
consists of three parts: classifier-assisted rank-based learning,
hypervolume-based non-dominated search, and local search in the relatively
sparse objective space. Specifically, a probabilistic neural network is built
as classifier to divide the offspring into a number of ranks. The offspring in
different ranks uses rank-based learning strategy to generate more promising
and informative candidates for real function evaluations. Then, radial basis
function networks are built as surrogates to approximate the objective
functions. After searching non-dominated solutions assisted by the surrogate
model, the candidates with higher hypervolume improvement are selected for real
evaluations. Subsequently, in order to maintain the diversity of solutions, the
most uncertain sample point from the non-dominated solutions measured by the
crowding distance is selected as the guided parent to further infill in the
uncertain region of the front. The experimental results of benchmark problems
and a real-world application on geothermal reservoir heat extraction
optimization demonstrate that the proposed algorithm shows superior performance

of evaluations of low-degree polynomials over a finite field on some sequence
of distinct field elements. They are widely known for their optimal
unique-decoding capabilities, but their list-decoding capabilities are not
fully understood. Given the prevalence of Reed-Solomon codes, a fundamental
question in coding theory is determining if Reed--Solomon codes can optimally
achieve list-decoding capacity.
  A recent breakthrough by Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam, established that
Reed--Solomon codes are combinatorially list-decodable all the way to capacity.
However, their results hold for randomly-punctured Reed--Solomon codes over an
exponentially large field size $2^{O(n)}$, where $n$ is the block length of the
code. A natural question is whether Reed--Solomon codes can still achieve
capacity over smaller fields. Recently, Guo and Zhang showed that Reed--Solomon
codes are list-decodable to capacity with field size $O(n^2)$. We show that
Reed--Solomon codes are list-decodable to capacity with linear field size
$O(n)$, which is optimal up to the constant factor. We also give evidence that
the ratio between the alphabet size $q$ and code length $n$ cannot be bounded
by an absolute constant.
  Our proof is based on the proof of Guo and Zhang, and additionally exploits
symmetries of reduced intersection matrices. With our proof, which maintains a
hypergraph perspective of the list-decoding problem, we include an alternate
presentation of ideas of Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam that more directly
connects the list-decoding problem to the GM-MDS theorem via a hypergraph

autonomous driving. Although many works have made great efforts and achieved
significant progress on this task, most of them suffer from expensive
annotation cost and poor transferability to unknown data due to the domain gap.
Recently, few works attempt to tackle the domain gap in objects, but still fail
to adapt to the gap of varying beam-densities between two domains, which is
critical to mitigate the characteristic differences of the LiDAR collectors. To
this end, we make the attempt to propose a density-insensitive domain adaption
framework to address the density-induced domain gap. In particular, we first
introduce Random Beam Re-Sampling (RBRS) to enhance the robustness of 3D
detectors trained on the source domain to the varying beam-density. Then, we
take this pre-trained detector as the backbone model, and feed the unlabeled
target domain data into our newly designed task-specific teacher-student
framework for predicting its high-quality pseudo labels. To further adapt the
property of density-insensitivity into the target domain, we feed the teacher
and student branches with the same sample of different densities, and propose
an Object Graph Alignment (OGA) module to construct two object-graphs between
the two branches for enforcing the consistency in both the attribute and
relation of cross-density objects. Experimental results on three widely adopted
3D object detection datasets demonstrate that our proposed domain adaption
method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, especially over

alignment between the two modalities, we hypothesize better modeling their

unsupervised ""language"" of videos via emergent communication, which bridges the
semantics of video details and structures of natural language. We learn
embodied representations of video trajectories, emergent language, and natural
language using a language model, which is then used to finetune a lightweight
policy network for downstream control. Through extensive experiments in
Metaworld and Franka Kitchen embodied benchmarks, EC^2 is shown to consistently
outperform previous contrastive learning methods for both videos and texts as
task inputs. Further ablations confirm the importance of the emergent language,
which is beneficial for both video and language learning, and significantly
superior to using pre-trained video captions. We also present a quantitative
and qualitative analysis of the emergent language and discuss future directions
toward better understanding and leveraging emergent communication in embodied

However, a standard assumption is that the domain growth is spatially uniform.
There are many relevant examples where this is not the case, such as the
colonisation of growing gut tissue by neural crest cells. As such, it is not
straightforward to disentangle the individual roles of heterogeneous growth and
diffusive transport. Here we present exact solutions to models of diffusive
transport on domains undergoing spatially non-uniform growth. The exact

superposition techniques. We verify the accuracy of these solutions via
comparison with simulations of a corresponding lattice-based random walk. We
explore various domain growth functions, including linear growth, exponential

that the correctness of the final result can be verified, even if some of the

  A standard component in this approach is so called cast-as-intended
verifiability which enables individual voters to verify that the ballots cast

cast-as-intended verifiability have been proposed in the literature, some of

to employ a second device which can be used by voters to audit their submitted

allow us to predict phonon frequency shifts and linewidth broadening that can

harmonic generation (HHG) naturally contains the fingerprints of atomic and

scheme for the Helmholtz equation in ${\mathbb R}^d$ for $d=2$ or $d=3$. Using
ideas from transformation optics, we construct an approximate cloak by
``blowing up"" a small ball of radius $\epsilon>0$ to one of radius $1$. In the
anisotropic cloaking layer resulting from the ``blow-up"" change of variables,
we incorporate a Drude-Lorentz-type model for the index of refraction, and we
assume that the cloaked object is a soft (perfectly conducting) obstacle. We
first show that (for any fixed $\epsilon$) there are no real transmission
eigenvalues associated with the inhomogeneity representing the cloak, which
implies that the cloaking devices we have created will not yield perfect
cloaking at any frequency, even for a single incident time harmonic wave.
Secondly, we establish estimates on the scattered field due to an arbitrary
time harmonic incident wave. These estimates show that, as $\epsilon$
approaches $0$, the $L^2$-norm of the scattered field outside the cloak, and
its far field pattern, approach $0$ uniformly over any bounded band of
frequencies. In other words: our scheme leads to broadband approximate cloaking
for arbitrary incident time harmonic waves.

applications such as metaverse and games often demand 3D content. On the other
hand, the requirement of 3D data, which is costly to acquire, significantly
impedes the development of 3D portrait stylization methods. In this paper,
inspired by the success of 3D-aware GANs that bridge 2D and 3D domains with 3D
fields as the intermediate representation for rendering 2D images, we propose a
novel method, dubbed HyperStyle3D, based on 3D-aware GANs for 3D portrait
stylization. At the core of our method is a hyper-network learned to manipulate
the parameters of the generator in a single forward pass. It not only offers a
strong capacity to handle multiple styles with a single model, but also enables
flexible fine-grained stylization that affects only texture, shape, or local
part of the portrait. While the use of 3D-aware GANs bypasses the requirement
of 3D data, we further alleviate the necessity of style images with the CLIP
model being the stylization guidance. We conduct an extensive set of
experiments across the style, attribute, and shape, and meanwhile, measure the
3D consistency. These experiments demonstrate the superior capability of our
HyperStyle3D model in rendering 3D-consistent images in diverse styles,
deforming the face shape, and editing various attributes.

almost 1300 stars distributed between ~0.8"" and 770"" from the cluster center.
From a sub-sample of high-quality measures, we determined the velocity
dispersion profile of the system over its entire radial extension (from ~ 5"" to
~ 200"" from the center), finding the characteristic behavior usually observed
in globular clusters, with a constant inner plateau and a declining trend at
larger radii. The projected density profile of the cluster has been obtained

hence its information on smaller scales will give us further insight on
primordial fluctuations. Since the formation of early galaxies is sensitive to
the amplitude of small-scale perturbations, and then, in turn, gives an impact
on the reionization history, one can probe the primordial power spectrum on
small scales through observations of reionization. In this work, we focus on
the running spectral indices of the primordial power spectrum to characterize
the small-scale perturbations, and investigate their constraints from
observations of the luminosity function of the Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters. We show

Handling non-diffuse effects, such as global illumination or cast shadows, has
long been a challenge in face relighting. Prior work often assumes Lambertian
surfaces, simplified lighting models or involves estimating 3D shape, albedo,
or a shadow map. This estimation, however, is error-prone and requires many
training examples with lighting ground truth to generalize well. Our work
bypasses the need for accurate estimation of intrinsic components and can be
trained solely on 2D images without any light stage data, multi-view images, or
lighting ground truth. Our key idea is to leverage a conditional diffusion
implicit model (DDIM) for decoding a disentangled light encoding along with
other encodings related to 3D shape and facial identity inferred from
off-the-shelf estimators. We also propose a novel conditioning technique that
eases the modeling of the complex interaction between light and geometry by
using a rendered shading reference to spatially modulate the DDIM. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark Multi-PIE and can
photorealistically relight in-the-wild images. Please visit our page:

applying this formula and the time-independent non-degenerate perturbation

state-of-the-art climate models and needs to be parameterized instead. The
natural scale separation between the forcing and the emergent turbulent flow
calls for a diffusive parameterization, where the eddy-induced fluxes are
related to the large-scale gradients by a diffusion tensor. The standard
parameterization scheme in climate modeling consists in adopting the
Gent-McWilliams/Redi (GM/R) form for the diffusion tensor, initially put
forward based on physical intuition and educated guesses before being put on
firm analytical footing using thickness-weighted average (TWA). In the present
contribution we provide a direct derivation of this diffusion tensor from the
quasi-geostrophic (QG) dynamics of a horizontally homogeneous three-dimensional
patch of ocean hosting a large-scale vertically-sheared zonal flow on the beta
plane. While less general than the TWA approach, the present QG framework leads
to rigorous constraints on the diffusion tensor. First, there is no diapycnal
diffusivity arising in the QG GM/R tensor for low viscosity and small-scale
diffusivities. The diffusion tensor then involves only two vertically dependent
coefficients, namely the GM transport coefficient $K_{GM}(z)$ and the Redi
diffusivity $K_R(z)$. Secondly, as already identified by previous authors the
vertical structures of the two coefficients are related by the so-called
Taylor-Bretherton relation. Finally, while the two coefficients generically
differ in the interior of the water column, we show that they are equal to one
another near the surface and near the bottom of the domain for low-enough
dissipative coefficients. We illustrate these findings by numerically
simulating the QG dynamics of a horizontally homogeneous patch of ocean hosting
a vertically sheared zonal current resembling the Antarctic Circumpolar
Current.

the simple weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction is used
to achieve the spatial accuracy, where the stencils for reconstruction contain
two levels of neighboring cells. Incorporate with the nonlinear generalized

the performance of some current spiking-based models is limited by their
structures which means either fully connected or too-deep structures bring too
much redundancy. This redundancy from both connection and neurons is one of the
key factors hindering the practical application of SNNs. Although Some pruning
methods were proposed to tackle this problem, they normally ignored the fact
the neural topology in the human brain could be adjusted dynamically. Inspired
by this, this paper proposed an evolutionary-based structure construction
method for constructing more reasonable SNNs. By integrating the knowledge
distillation and connection pruning method, the synaptic connections in SNNs
can be optimized dynamically to reach an optimal state. As a result, the
structure of SNNs could not only absorb knowledge from the teacher model but
also search for deep but sparse network topology. Experimental results on
CIFAR100 and DVS-Gesture show that the proposed structure learning method can
get pretty well performance while reducing the connection redundancy. The

reconstruction from a single RGB image. Most recently, the non-local
interactions of the whole mesh vertices have been effectively estimated in the
transformer while the relationship between body parts also has begun to be
handled via the graph model. Even though those approaches have shown the
remarkable progress in 3D human mesh reconstruction, it is still difficult to
directly infer the relationship between features, which are encoded from the 2D
input image, and 3D coordinates of each vertex. To resolve this problem, we
propose to design a simple feature sampling scheme. The key idea is to sample
features in the embedded space by following the guide of points, which are
estimated as projection results of 3D mesh vertices (i.e., ground truth). This
helps the model to concentrate more on vertex-relevant features in the 2D
space, thus leading to the reconstruction of the natural human pose.
Furthermore, we apply progressive attention masking to precisely estimate local
interactions between vertices even under severe occlusions. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method efficiently
improves the performance of 3D human mesh reconstruction. The code and model

skyrmions are weakly entangled, and the entanglement increases with decreasing
DMI. We also find that the central spin is completely disentangled from the
rest of the lattice, establishing a non-destructive way of detecting this type
of skyrmion by local magnetization measurements. While neural networks are well
suited to detect weakly entangled skyrmions with large DMI, they struggle to
describe skyrmions in the small DMI regime due to nearly degenerate ground

outperform conventional model-based methods by large margins. Recently,
self-supervised methods have attracted attention because constructing a large
real noise dataset for supervised training is an enormous burden. The most
representative self-supervised denoisers are based on blind-spot networks,
which exclude the receptive field's center pixel. However, excluding any input
pixel is abandoning some information, especially when the input pixel at the
corresponding output position is excluded. In addition, a standard blind-spot
network fails to reduce real camera noise due to the pixel-wise correlation of
noise, though it successfully removes independently distributed synthetic
noise. Hence, to realize a more practical denoiser, we propose a novel
self-supervised training framework that can remove real noise. For this, we
derive the theoretic upper bound of a supervised loss where the network is
guided by the downsampled blinded output. Also, we design a conditional
blind-spot network (C-BSN), which selectively controls the blindness of the
network to use the center pixel information. Furthermore, we exploit a random
subsampler to decorrelate noise spatially, making the C-BSN free of visual
artifacts that were often seen in downsample-based methods. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed C-BSN achieves state-of-the-art performance
on real-world datasets as a self-supervised denoiser and shows qualitatively
pleasing results without any post-processing or refinement.

networks. As an excellent clustering algorithm, Mean-Shift can not be applied
directly to community detection, since Mean-Shift can only handle data with
coordinates, while the data in the community detection problem is mostly
represented by a graph that can be treated as data with a distance matrix (or
similarity matrix). Fortunately, a new clustering algorithm called Medoid-Shift
is proposed. The Medoid-Shift algorithm preserves the benefits of Mean-Shift
and can be applied to problems based on distance matrix, such as community
detection. One drawback of the Medoid-Shift algorithm is that there may be no
data points within the neighborhood region defined by a distance parameter. To
deal with the community detection problem better, a new algorithm called
Revised Medoid-Shift (RMS) in this work is thus proposed. During the process of
finding the next medoid, the RMS algorithm is based on a neighborhood defined
by KNN, while the original Medoid-Shift is based on a neighborhood defined by a
distance parameter. Since the neighborhood defined by KNN is more stable than
the one defined by the distance parameter in terms of the number of data points
within the neighborhood, the RMS algorithm may converge more smoothly. In the
RMS method, each of the data points is shifted towards a medoid within the
neighborhood defined by KNN. After the iterative process of shifting, each of
the data point converges into a cluster center, and the data points converging
into the same center are grouped into the same cluster.

Its abundance, significantly enhanced, could be the result of large grains

frequency, preserving efficacy but improving on secondary outcomes such as
safety, costs or convenience. The main features of this design are that (i) it
randomises patients to a moderate number of arms across the continuum and (ii)
it uses a model to share information across arms. While papers published to
date about the design have focused on analysis aspects, here we show how to
design such a trial in practice. We use the REFINE-Lung trial as an example;
this is a trial seeking the optimal frequency of immunotherapy treatment for
non-small cell lung cancer patients. Because the aspect of treatment
administration to optimise is frequency, rather than duration, we propose to
rename the design as Multi-Arm Multi-Stage Response Over Continuous
Intervention (MAMS-ROCI). Methods. We show how simulations can be used to
design such a trial. We propose to use the ADEMP framework to plan such
simulations, clearly specifying aims, data generating mechanisms, estimands,
methods and performance measures before coding and analysing the simulations.
We discuss the possible choices to be made using the REFINE-Lung trial as an
example. Results. We describe all the choices made while designing the
REFINE-Lung trial, and the results of the simulations performed. We justify our
choice of total sample size based on these results. Conclusions. MAMS-ROCI
trials can be designed using simulation studies that have to be carefully
planned and conducted. REFINE-Lung has been designed using such an approach and
we have shown how researchers could similarly design their own MAMS-ROCI trial.

precisely controlling small dielectric objects. However, due to their very
nature, conventional optical traps are diffraction limited and require high
intensities to confine the dielectric objects. In this work, we propose a novel
optical trap based on dielectric photonic crystal nanobeam cavities, which
overcomes the limitations of conventional optical traps by significant factors.
This is achieved by exploiting an optomechanically induced backaction mechanism
between a dielectric nanoparticle and the cavities. We perform numerical
simulations to show that our trap can fully levitate a submicron-scale
dielectric particle with a trap width as narrow as 56 nm. It allows for
achieving a high trap stiffness, therefore, a high Q-frequency product for the
particle's motion while reducing the optical absorption by a factor of 43
compared to the cases for conventional optical tweezers. Moreover, we show that
multiple laser tones can be used further to create a complex, dynamic potential
landscape with feature sizes well below the diffraction limit. The presented
optical trapping system offers new opportunities for precision sensing and
fundamental quantum experiments based on levitated particles.

large-scale data collection and high sample complexity. Especially, for some

from extreme finite-source effects. While modeling their light curves, there is
a known continuous degeneracy between their relevant lensing parameters, i.e.,
the source angular radius normalized to the angular Einstein radius
$\rho_{\star}$, the Einstein crossing time $t_{\rm E}$, the lens impact
parameter $u_{0}$, the blending parameter, and the stellar apparent magnitude.
In this work, I numerically study the origin of this degeneracy. I find that
these light curves have 5 observational parameters (i.e., the baseline
magnitude, the maximum deviation in the magnification factor, the Full Width at
Half Maximum $\rm{FWHM}=2 t_{\rm{HM}}$, the deviation from top-hat model, the
time of the maximum time-derivative of microlensing light curves
$T_{\rm{max}}=t_{\rm E}\sqrt{\rho_{\star}^{2}-u_{0}^{2}}$). For extreme
finite-source microlensing events due to uniform source stars we get
$t_{\rm{HM}}\simeq T_{\rm{max}}$, and the deviation from the top-hat model
tends to zero which both cause the known continuous degeneracy. When either
$\rho_{\star}\lesssim10$ or the limb-darkening effect is considerable
$t_{\rm{HM}}$, and $T_{\rm{max}}$ are two independent observational parameters.
I use a numerical approach, i.e., Random Forests containing $100$-$120$
Decision Trees, to study how these observational parameters are efficient in
yielding the lensing parameters. These machine learning models find the
mentioned 5 lensing parameters for finite-source microlensing events from
uniform, and limb-darkened source stars with the average $R^{2}$-scores of
$0.87$, and $0.84$, respectively. $R^{2}$-score for evaluating the lens impact
parameter gets worse on adding limb darkening, and for extracting the
limb-darkening coefficient itself this score falls as low as $0.67$.

the study of exploring generative LLMs such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 for relevance

that properly instructed ChatGPT and GPT-4 can deliver competitive, even
superior results than supervised methods on popular IR benchmarks. Notably,
GPT-4 outperforms the fully fine-tuned monoT5-3B on MS MARCO by an average of
2.7 nDCG on TREC datasets, an average of 2.3 nDCG on eight BEIR datasets, and
an average of 2.7 nDCG on ten low-resource languages Mr.TyDi. Subsequently, we
delve into the potential for distilling the ranking capabilities of ChatGPT

Computing the sensitivity of some simple queries such as counting query is
easy, however, computing the sensitivity of complex queries containing join

mass functions, leading to a deficit of massive stars. In binary stellar
populations, the full range of binary separations and mass ratios will also be
underpopulated. To explore the effects of stochastic sampling in the integrated
light of stellar clusters, we calculate models at a broad range of cluster
masses, from 10^2 to 10^7 M_sun, using a binary stellar population synthesis
code. For clusters with stellar masses less than 10^5 M_sun, observable
quantities show substantial scatter and their mean properties reflect the
expected deficit of massive stars. In common with previous work, we find that
purely stochastic sampling of the initial mass function appears to
underestimate the mass of the most massive star in known clusters. However,
even with this constraint, the majority of clusters likely inject sufficient
kinetic energy to clear their birth clusters of gas. For quantities which
directly measure the impact of the most massive stars, such as N_{ion},
xi_{ion} and beta_{UV}, uncertainties due to stochastic sampling dominate over
those from the IMF shape or distribution of binary parameters, while stochastic
sampling has a negligible effect on the stellar continuum luminosity density.

we take into account this extra information by introducing an additional

in better anticipating future events. Volcanic activity is the result of a
complex interaction between internal and external processes, with time scales
spanning multiple orders of magnitude. We review periodicities that have been
detected or correlated with volcanic eruptions/phenomena and interpreted as
resulting from external forces. Taking a global perspective and longer time
scales than a few years, we approach this interaction by analyzing three time
series using singular spectral analysis: the global number of volcanic
eruptions (NVE) between 1700 and 2022, the number of sunspots (ISSN), a proxy
for solar activity, the polar motion (PM) and length of day (lod), two proxies
for gravitational force. Several pseudo-periodicities are common to NVE and
ISSN, in addition to the 11-year Schwabe cycle that has been reported in
previous work, but NVE shares even more periodicities with PM. These
quasi-periodic components range from ~5 to ~130 years. We interpret our
analytical results in light of the Laplace's paradigm and propose that,
similarly to the movement of Earth's rotation axis, global eruptive activity is
modulated by commensurable orbital moments of the Jovian planets, whose
influence is also detected in solar activity.

classical chaos regions with positive and large Lyapunov exponents are
identified as a function of the potential well tilting and dressed

are large, giving rise to signatures of strong quantum chaos. We find that both
the time averaged entanglement entropy and survival probability of the initial

larval zebrafish. Owing to its small size and transparency, this vertebrate
enables optical access to the entire brain. Indeed, the combination of this
organism with light-sheet imaging grants high spatio-temporal resolution
volumetric recording of neuronal activity. This imaging technique, in its
multiphoton variant, allows functional investigations without unwanted visual
stimulation. Here, we employed a custom two-photon light-sheet microscope to
study whole-brain differences in neuronal activity between diurnal and
nocturnal periods in larval zebrafish. We describe for the first time an
activity increase in the low frequency domain of the pretectum and a
frequency-localised activity decrease of the anterior rhombencephalic turning
region during the nocturnal period. Moreover, our data confirm a nocturnal
reduction in habenular activity. Furthermore, whole-brain detrended fluctuation
analysis revealed a nocturnal decrease in the self-affinity of the neuronal
signals in parts of the dorsal thalamus and the medulla oblongata. Our data
show that whole-brain nonlinear light-sheet imaging represents a useful tool to
investigate circadian rhythm effects on neuronal activity.

applications, including distant point-to-point communications, safety radars,
and many others. While a common approach to elevate gain is to enlarge an
antenna aperture, highly resonant subwavelength structures can potentially
grant high gain performances. The Chu-Harrington limit is a standard criterion
to assess electrically small structures and those surpassing it are called
superdirective. Supergain is obtained in a case when internal losses are
mitigated, and an antenna is matched to radiation, though typically in a very
narrow frequency band. Here we develop a concept of a spectrally overlapping
resonant cascading, where tailored multipole hierarchy grants both high gain
and sufficient operational bandwidth. Our architecture is based on a near-field
coupled wire bundle. Genetic optimization, constraining both gain and
bandwidth, is applied on a 24-dimensional space and predicts 8.81 dBi realized
gain within a half-wavelength in a cube volume. The experimental gain is 6.15
with 13% fractional bandwidth. Small wire bundle structures are rather
attractive for designing superscattering and superdirective structures, as they
have a sufficient number of degrees of freedom to perform an optimization, and,
at the same time rely on simple fabrication-tolerant layouts, based on low-loss
materials. The developed approach can be applied to low-frequency (e.g.,
kHz-MHz) applications, where miniaturization of wireless devices is highly
demanded.

plays an important role in boosting the RD performance. Analysis transform
converts the input image to a compact latent representation. The more compact
the latent representation is, the fewer bits we need to compress it. When
designing better transform, some previous works adopt Swin-Transformer. The
success of the Swin-Transformer in image compression can be attributed to the
dynamic weights and large receptive field.However,the LayerNorm adopted in
transformers is not suitable for image compression.We find CNN-based modules
can also be dynamic and have large receptive-fields. The CNN-based modules can
also work with GDN/IGDN. To make the CNN-based modules dynamic, we generate the
weights of kernels conditioned on the input feature. We scale up the size of
each kernel for larger receptive fields. To reduce complexity, we make the
CNN-module channel-wise connected. We call this module Dynamic Depth-wise
convolution. We replace the self-attention module with the proposed Dynamic
Depth-wise convolution, replace the embedding layer with a depth-wise residual
bottleneck for non-linearity and replace the FFN layer with an inverted
residual bottleneck for more interactions in the spatial domain. The
interactions among channels of dynamic depth-wise convolution are limited. We
design the other block, which replaces the dynamic depth-wise convolution with
channel attention. We equip the proposed modules in the analysis and synthesis

learned image compression model SLIC, meaning Self-Conditioned Adaptive

gains in graph neural networks (GNNs). In addition to pre-training techniques,
inspired by the latest work in the natural language fields, more recent work
has shifted towards applying effective fine-tuning approaches, such as
parameter-efficient tuning (delta tuning). However, given the substantial
differences between GNNs and transformer-based models, applying such approaches
directly to GNNs proved to be less effective. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive comparison of delta tuning techniques for GNNs and propose a
novel delta tuning method specifically designed for GNNs, called AdapterGNN.
AdapterGNN preserves the knowledge of the large pre-trained model and leverages
highly expressive adapters for GNNs, which can adapt to downstream tasks
effectively with only a few parameters, while also improving the model's
generalization ability on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that
AdapterGNN achieves higher evaluation performance (outperforming full
fine-tuning by 1.4% and 5.5% in the chemistry and biology domains respectively,

full fine-tuning. Moreover, we empirically show that a larger GNN model can
have a worse generalization ability, which differs from the trend observed in
large language models. We have also provided a theoretical justification for

use the resultant fracton geometry to show that it is not possible to construct
an equilibrium partition function for global thermal states unless part of the

classes of fracton superfluids with conserved energy and momentum, namely
$p$-wave and $s$-wave fracton superfluids. The latter phase is an Aristotelian
superfluid at ideal order but with a velocity constraint and can be split into
two separate regimes: the U(1) fracton superfluid and the pinned $s$-wave
superfluid regimes. For each of these classes and regimes we formulate a
hydrodynamic expansion and study the resultant modes. We find distinctive
features of each of these phases and regimes at ideal order in gradients,

utilize the biased word information to improve the performance of the automatic
speech recognition model in the target domain becomes a hot research topic.
Previous approaches either decode with a fixed external language model or
introduce a sizeable biasing module, which leads to poor adaptability and slow
inference. In this work, we propose CB-Conformer to improve biased word
recognition by introducing the Contextual Biasing Module and the Self-Adaptive
Language Model to vanilla Conformer. The Contextual Biasing Module combines
audio fragments and contextual information, with only 0.2% model parameters of
the original Conformer. The Self-Adaptive Language Model modifies the internal
weights of biased words based on their recall and precision, resulting in a
greater focus on biased words and more successful integration with the
automatic speech recognition model than the standard fixed language model. In
addition, we construct and release an open-source Mandarin biased-word dataset
based on WenetSpeech. Experiments indicate that our proposed method brings a
15.34% character error rate reduction, a 14.13% biased word recall increase,
and a 6.80% biased word F1-score increase compared with the base Conformer.

the fact that these behaviors exhibit correlations across many time scales. But
there are major challenges in analyzing these data: records of behavior in

data from multiple animals, individual differences can mimic long-ranged
temporal correlations; conversely long-ranged correlations can lead to an
over-estimate of individual differences. We suggest an analysis scheme that
addresses these problems directly, apply this approach to data on the
spontaneous behavior of walking flies, and find evidence for scale invariant

recent years, encompassing both 2D and 3D object detection. Recent research in

this issue.In this paper, a multimodal fusion approach based on result
feature-level fusion is proposed. This method utilizes the outcome features
generated from single modality sources, and fuses them for downstream
tasks.Based on this method, a new post-fusing network is proposed for
multimodal object detection, which leverages the single modality outcomes as
features. The proposed approach, called Multi-Modal Detector based on Result
features (MMDR), is designed to work for both 2D and 3D object detection tasks.
Compared to previous multimodal models, the proposed approach in this paper
performs feature fusion at a later stage, enabling better representation of the
deep-level features of single modality sources. Additionally, the MMDR model
incorporates shallow global features during the feature fusion stage, endowing
the model with the ability to perceive background information and the overall
input, thereby avoiding issues such as missed detections.

  Problem","Submitted to the IEEE for possible publication",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many relevant problems in industrial settings result in NP-hard optimization
problems, such as the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) or its reduced
variant, the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP). Even with today's most
powerful classical algorithms, the CVRP is challenging to solve classically.
Quantum computing may offer a way to improve the time to solution, although the
question remains open as to whether Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)
devices can achieve a practical advantage compared to classical heuristics. The
most prominent algorithms proposed to solve combinatorial optimization problems
in the NISQ era are the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and
the more general Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). However, implementing
them in a way that reliably provides high-quality solutions is challenging,
even for toy examples. In this work, we discuss decomposition and formulation
aspects of the CVRP and propose an application-driven way to measure solution
quality. Considering current hardware constraints, we reduce the CVRP to a
clustering phase and a set of TSPs. For the TSP, we extensively test both QAOA
and VQE and investigate the influence of various hyperparameters, such as the
classical optimizer choice and strength of constraint penalization. Results of
QAOA are generally of limited quality because the algorithm does not reach the
energy threshold for feasible TSP solutions, even when considering various
extensions such as recursive, warm-start and constraint-preserving mixer QAOA.
On the other hand, the VQE reaches the energy threshold and shows a better
performance. Our work outlines the obstacles to quantum-assisted solutions for
real-world optimization problems and proposes perspectives on how to overcome
them.

segmentation, but they require a large manually labeled dataset for training
and are difficult to extend to unseen categories. Few-shot segmentation(FSS)
has the potential to address these challenges by learning new categories from a
small number of labeled samples. The majority of the current methods employ a
prototype learning architecture, which involves expanding support prototype
vectors and concatenating them with query features to conduct conditional
segmentation. However, such framework potentially focuses more on query
features while may neglect the correlation between support and query features.
In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised few shot medical image
segmentation network with Cross-Reference Transformer, which addresses the lack
of interaction between the support image and the query image. We first enhance
the correlation features between the support set image and the query image
using a bidirectional cross-attention module. Then, we employ a cross-reference
mechanism to mine and enhance the similar parts of support features and query
features in high-dimensional channels. Experimental results show that the
proposed model achieves good results on both CT dataset and MRI dataset.

ray-tracing into the coverage planning process, thus allowing the agent to
identify which parts of the scene are visible at any point in time. The problem
of integrated ray-tracing and coverage planning control is first formulated as
a constrained optimal control problem (OCP), which aims at determining the
agent's optimal control inputs over a finite planning horizon, that minimize
the coverage time. Efficiently solving the resulting OCP is however very
challenging due to non-convex and non-linear visibility constraints. To
overcome this limitation, the problem is converted into a Markov decision
process (MDP) which is then solved using reinforcement learning. In particular,
we show that a controller which follows an optimal control law can be learned
using off-policy temporal-difference control (i.e., Q-learning). Extensive
numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach

Furthermore, to focus on complex manipulations, transitions with larger

experiments in a pre-clinical environment demonstrate that CASOG can deliver
guidewire to the target at a success rate of 94.00\% and mean backward steps of

Hamilton's variational principle. The extended canonical transformation theory
then naturally permits transformations that also map the time scales of

$H_{1}$, and hence the form of the canonical equations derived from $H_{1}$.
The Lorentz transformation, as well as time scaling transformations in
celestial mechanics, will be shown to represent particular canonical

allowing repeated edges with distinct timestamps, $\mathcal{G}(\mathbf{D})$ can

comprehension of each building block (e.g. Hamiltonian, radiation reaction,
ringdown attachment). Here we go back to the spirit of the first EOB works. We
focus first on nonspinning, quasi-circular, black hole binaries and analyze
systematically the mutual synergy between numerical relativity (NR) informed
functions and the high post-Newtonian corrections (up to 5PN) to the EOB
potentials. Our main finding is that it is essential to correctly control the
noncircular part of the dynamics during the late plunge up to merger. When this
happens, either using NR-informed non-quasi-circular corrections to the
waveform (and flux) or high-PN corrections in the radial EOB potentials
$(D,Q)$, it is easy to obtain EOB/NR unfaithfulness $\sim 10^{-4}$ with the
noise of either Advanced LIGO or 3G detectors. We then improve the {\tt

favorably to high dimensional problems. In particular, we use a
projection-based optimal transport solver [Meng et al., 2019] to join
successive samples and subsequently use transport splines [Chewi et al., 2020]
to interpolate the evolving density. When the sampling frequency is
sufficiently high, the optimal maps are close to the identity and are thus
computationally efficient to compute. Moreover, the training process is highly
parallelizable as all optimal maps are independent and can thus be learned
simultaneously. Finally, the approach is based solely on numerical linear
algebra rather than minimizing a nonconvex objective function, allowing us to
easily analyze and control the algorithm. We present several numerical
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the
efficiency of our method. In particular, these experiments show that the

computability/complexity and the modelling standpoints, automata networks seem

interact with each other over discrete time, interactions being defined as
local functions allowing the automata to change their state according to the
states of their neighbourhoods. The studies on this model of computation have
underlined the very importance of the way (i.e. the schedule) according to
which the automata update their states, namely the update modes which can be
deterministic, periodic, fair, or not. Indeed, a given network may admit
numerous underlying dynamics, these latter depending highly on the update modes

graph algorithms and it is a problem that has seen tremendous progress over the
last few years. Much of the remarkable recent progress on deterministic
distributed coloring algorithms is based on two main tools: a) defective
colorings in which every node of a given color can have a limited number of
neighbors of the same color and b) list coloring, a natural generalization of
the standard coloring problem that naturally appears when colorings are
computed in different stages and one has to extend a previously computed
partial coloring to a full coloring.
  In this paper, we introduce \emph{list defective colorings}, which can be
seen as a generalization of these two coloring variants. Essentially, in a list
defective coloring instance, each node $v$ is given a list of colors
$x_{v,1},\dots,x_{v,p}$ together with a list of defects $d_{v,1},\dots,d_{v,p}$
such that if $v$ is colored with color $x_{v, i}$, it is allowed to have at
most $d_{v, i}$ neighbors with color $x_{v, i}$.
  We highlight the important role of list defective colorings by showing that
faster list defective coloring algorithms would directly lead to faster
deterministic $(\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithms in the LOCAL model. Further, we
extend a recent distributed list coloring algorithm by Maus and Tonoyan [DISC
'20]. Slightly simplified, we show that if for each node $v$ it holds that
$\sum_{i=1}^p \big(d_{v,i}+1)^2 > \mathrm{deg}_G^2(v)\cdot polylog\Delta$ then
this list defective coloring instance can be solved in a
communication-efficient way in only $O(\log\Delta)$ communication rounds. This
leads to the first deterministic $(\Delta+1)$-coloring algorithm in the
standard CONGEST model with a time complexity of $O(\sqrt{\Delta}\cdot polylog
\Delta+\log^* n)$, matching the best time complexity in the LOCAL model up to a
$polylog\Delta$ factor.

sensing (RS) and earth observation (EO) communities owing to its ability to
learn task-agnostic representations without human-annotated labels.
Nevertheless, most existing RS SSL methods are limited to learning either
global semantic separable or local spatial perceptible representations. We
argue that this learning strategy is suboptimal in the realm of RS, since the
required representations for different RS downstream tasks are often varied and
complex. In this study, we proposed a unified SSL framework that is better
suited for RS images representation learning. The proposed SSL framework,
Contrastive Mask Image Distillation (CMID), is capable of learning
representations with both global semantic separability and local spatial
perceptibility by combining contrastive learning (CL) with masked image
modeling (MIM) in a self-distillation way. Furthermore, our CMID learning
framework is architecture-agnostic, which is compatible with both convolutional
neural networks (CNN) and vision transformers (ViT), allowing CMID to be easily
adapted to a variety of deep learning (DL) applications for RS understanding.
Comprehensive experiments have been carried out on four downstream tasks (i.e.
scene classification, semantic segmentation, object-detection, and change
detection) and the results show that models pre-trained using CMID achieve
better performance than other state-of-the-art SSL methods on multiple
downstream tasks. The code and pre-trained models will be made available at
https://github.com/NJU-LHRS/official-CMID to facilitate SSL research and speed
up the development of RS images DL applications.

Relativity (GR). MGR explicitly uses the smooth regular line element vector
field $(\bm{X},-\bm{X}) $, which exists in all Lorentzian spacetimes, to
construct a connection-independent symmetric tensor that represents the
energy-momentum of the gravitational field. It solves the problem of the
non-localization of gravitational energy-momentum in GR, preserves the ontology
of the Einstein equation, and maintains the equivalence principle. The line
element field provides MGR with the extra freedom required to describe dark
energy and dark matter. An extended Schwarzschild solution for the matter-free
Einstein equation of MGR is developed, from which the Tully-Fisher relation is
derived, and the gravitational energy density is calculated. The mass of the
invisible matter halo of galaxy NGC 3198 calculated with MGR is identical to
the result obtained from GR using a dark matter profile. Although dark matter
in MGR is described geometrically, it has an equivalent representation as a
particle with the property of a vector boson or a pair of fermions; the
geometry of spacetime and the quantum nature of matter are linked together by
the unit line element covectors that belong to both the Lorentzian metric and
the spin-1 Klein-Gordon wave equation. The three classic tests of GR provide a
comparison of the theories in the solar system and several parts of the cosmos.
MGR provides the flexibility to describe inflation after the Big Bang and
galactic anisotropies.

qualitatively understood by describing the wave field in the metamaterial using
the local Bloch wave approximation (LBWA), which locally represents the wave
field as a superposition of propagating wave solutions in the cognate infinite

quantitatively in the context of two-dimensional linear water-wave scattering
by graded arrays of surface-piercing vertical barriers. To do this, we
implement the LBWA numerically so that the Bloch waves in one region of the
graded array are coupled to Bloch waves in adjacent regions. This coupling is
computed by solving the scattering of Bloch waves across the interface between
two semi-infinite arrays of vertical barriers, where the barriers in each
semi-infinite array can have different submergence depths. Our results suggest
that the LBWA accurately predicts the free surface amplitude across a wide

geo-distributed transactional databases. Existing state-of-the-art databases
adopt a sharded master-follower replication architecture. However, the
single-master serving mode incurs massive cross-region writes from clients, and
the sharded architecture requires multiple round-trip acknowledgments (e.g.,
2PC) to ensure atomicity for cross-shard transactions. These limitations drive
us to seek yet another design choice. In this paper, we propose a strongly
consistent OLTP database GeoGauss with full replica multi-master architecture.
To efficiently merge the updates from different master nodes, we propose a
multi-master OCC that unifies data replication and concurrent transaction
processing. By leveraging an epoch-based delta state merge rule and the
optimistic asynchronous execution, GeoGauss ensures strong consistency with
light-coordinated protocol and allows more concurrency with weak isolation,
which are sufficient to meet our needs. Our geo-distributed experimental
results show that GeoGauss achieves 7.06X higher throughput and 17.41X lower
latency than the state-of-the-art geo-distributed database CockroachDB on the

mapping called visibility graph (VG) of time series generated in dynamical

patterns of the VGs, we were able to distinguish between critical and

correlation on the degree for series near the critical regime in contrast with
a pure assortative correlation observed for non-critical dynamics. We were also

Intent-Based Networking (IBN) pushes the frontiers of efficient networking by
decoupling the intentions of a network operator (i.e., what is desired to be

such a paradigm have long been argued and include, but are not limited to, the
reduction of human errors, reduced expertise requirements among operator

how incorporating IBN in multi-domain networks can have a significantly
positive impact as it can enable decentralized operation, accountability, and

intents can now end up using the same network resources. While this makes the

component of many biological processes. We previously found that the terminal
approach phase of such dynamics exhibits universal types of stochastic dynamics
that differ qualitatively between noise-dominated and force-dominated regimes
of the approach dynamics. While for the noise-dominated regime the approach
dynamics is uninformative about the underlying force law, in the
force-dominated regime it enables the accurate inference of the underlying
dynamics. Biological systems often exhibit substantial parameter heterogeneity,
for instance through copy number fluctuations of key molecules or variability
in modulating factors. Here, we extend our theory of target state aligned (TSA)
stochastic dynamics to investigate the impact of parameter heterogeneity in the
underlying stochastic dynamics. We examine the approach to target states for a
wide range of dynamical laws and additive as well as multiplicative noise. We
find that the distinct regimes of noise-dominated and force-dominated dynamics
strongly differ in their sensitivity to parameter heterogeneity. In the
noise-dominated regime, TSA ensembles are insensitive to parameter
heterogeneity in the force law, but sensitive to sample to sample heterogeneity
in the diffusion constant. For force-dominated dynamics, both parameter
heterogeneity in the force law and diffusion constant change the behaviour of
the non-stationary statistics and in particular the two-time-covariance
functions. In this regime, TSA ensembles provide a sensitive readout of
parameter heterogeneity. Under natural conditions, parameter heterogeneity in
many biological systems cannot be experimentally controlled or eliminated. Our
results provide a systematic theoretical foundation for the analysis of target

DERivatives) scheme using the simple HWENO method (ADER-SHWENO) is proposed for
hyperbolic conservation laws. The newly-developed method employs the
Lax-Wendroff procedure to convert time derivatives to spatial derivatives,
which provides the time evolution of the variables at the cell interfaces. This
information is required for the simple HWENO reconstructions, which take
advantages of the simple WENO and the classic HWENO. Compared with the original
Runge-Kutta HWENO method (RK-HWENO), the new method has two advantages.
Firstly, RK-HWENO method must solve the additional equations for
reconstructions, which is avoided for the new method. Secondly, the SHWENO
reconstruction is performed once with one stencil and is different from the
classic HWENO methods, in which both the function and its derivative values are
reconstructed with two different stencils, respectively. Thus the new method is
more efficient than the RK-HWENO method. Moreover, the new method is more
compact than the existing ADER-WENO method. Besides, the new method makes the
best use of the information in the ADER method. Thus, the time evolution of the
cell averages of the derivatives is simpler than that developed in the work [Li

achieve high order for smooth solutions both in space and time, keep

challenging using traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods. As the number of
frequency bands increases, the required number of training samples increases
exponentially to achieve a reasonable classification accuracy, also known as
the curse of dimensionality. Therefore, separate band selection or
dimensionality reduction techniques are often applied before performing any
classification task over HSI data. In this study, we investigate recently
proposed subspace learning methods for one-class classification (OCC). These
methods map high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional feature space that is
optimized for one-class classification. In this way, there is no separate
dimensionality reduction or feature selection procedure needed in the proposed
classification framework. Moreover, one-class classifiers have the ability to
learn a data description from the category of a single class only. Considering
the imbalanced labels of the LULC classification problem and rich spectral

is well-suited for HSI data. Overall, this is a pioneer study focusing on
subspace learning-based one-class classification for HSI data. We analyze the

incompressibility of excitons is further corroborated by measuring exciton

exercise data, the first step is to segment it into consecutive repetitions.
There has been a significant amount of research performed on segmenting and
counting the repetitive activities of healthy individuals using raw video data,
which raises concerns regarding privacy and is computationally intensive.
Previous research on patients' rehabilitation exercise segmentation relied on
data collected by multiple wearable sensors, which are difficult to use at home
by rehabilitation patients. Compared to healthy individuals, segmenting and
counting exercise repetitions in patients is more challenging because of the
irregular repetition duration and the variation between repetitions. This paper
presents a novel approach for segmenting and counting the repetitions of
rehabilitation exercises performed by patients, based on their skeletal body
joints. Skeletal body joints can be acquired through depth cameras or computer
vision techniques applied to RGB videos of patients. Various sequential neural
networks are designed to analyze the sequences of skeletal body joints and
perform repetition segmentation and counting. Extensive experiments on three

Dasgupta et al. (ICML 2020) posed the question of the price of explainability:
the worst-case ratio between the cost of the best explainable clusterings to
that of the best clusterings.
  We show that the price of explainability for $k$-medians is at most
$1+H_{k-1}$; in fact, we show that the popular Random Thresholds algorithm has
exactly this price of explanability, matching the known lower bound
constructions. We complement our tight analysis of this particular algorithm by
constructing instances where the price of explanability (using any algorithm)
is at least $(1-o(1)) \ln k$, showing that our result is best possible, up to
lower-order terms. We also improve the price of explanability for the $k$-means
problem to $O(k \ln \ln k)$ from the previous $O(k \ln k)$, considerably
closing the gap to the lower bounds of $\Omega(k)$.
  Finally, we study the algorithmic question of finding the best explainable
clustering: We show that explainable $k$-medians and $k$-means cannot be
approximated better than $O(\ln k)$, under standard complexity-theoretic
conjectures. This essentially settles the approximability of explainable
$k$-medians and leaves open the intriguing possibility to get significantly
better approximation algorithms for $k$-means than its price of explainability.

linearly increases with the Fermi energy, resulting from the linear dispersion

cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in AI research. However,
many research endeavours heavily rely on parameter sharing among agents, which
confines them to only homogeneous-agent setting and leads to training
instability and lack of convergence guarantees. To achieve effective
cooperation in the general heterogeneous-agent setting, we propose
Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) algorithms that resolve the
aforementioned issues. Central to our findings are the multi-agent advantage
decomposition lemma and the sequential update scheme. Based on these, we
develop the provably correct Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region Learning (HATRL)
that is free of parameter-sharing constraint, and derive HATRPO and HAPPO by
tractable approximations. Furthermore, we discover a novel framework named
Heterogeneous-Agent Mirror Learning (HAML), which strengthens theoretical
guarantees for HATRPO and HAPPO and provides a general template for cooperative
MARL algorithmic designs. We prove that all algorithms derived from HAML
inherently enjoy monotonic improvement of joint reward and convergence to Nash
Equilibrium. As its natural outcome, HAML validates more novel algorithms in
addition to HATRPO and HAPPO, including HAA2C, HADDPG, and HATD3, which
consistently outperform their existing MA-counterparts. We comprehensively test
HARL algorithms on six challenging benchmarks and demonstrate their superior
effectiveness and stability for coordinating heterogeneous agents compared to
strong baselines such as MAPPO and QMIX.

robustness results from a set of data samples to evaluate and rank different
models. However, the local statistics may not well represent the true global
robustness of the underlying unknown data distribution. To address this
challenge, this paper makes the first attempt to present a new framework,
called GREAT Score , for global robustness evaluation of adversarial
perturbation using generative models. Formally, GREAT Score carries the
physical meaning of a global statistic capturing a mean certified attack-proof
perturbation level over all samples drawn from a generative model. For
finite-sample evaluation, we also derive a probabilistic guarantee on the
sample complexity and the difference between the sample mean and the true mean.
GREAT Score has several advantages: (1) Robustness evaluations using GREAT
Score are efficient and scalable to large models, by sparing the need of
running adversarial attacks. In particular, we show high correlation and
significantly reduced computation cost of GREAT Score when compared to the
attack-based model ranking on RobustBench (Croce,et. al. 2021). (2) The use of
generative models facilitates the approximation of the unknown data
distribution. In our ablation study with different generative adversarial
networks (GANs), we observe consistency between global robustness evaluation
and the quality of GANs. (3) GREAT Score can be used for remote auditing of
privacy-sensitive black-box models, as demonstrated by our robustness
evaluation on several online facial recognition services.

achieved success on the computer vision. In this paper, our goal is to explore
the constrastive learning in the domain of misinformation identification. We

$\mathcal{L}_{m}=-\frac{1}{3}(p_{r}+2 p_{t})$ to classify the complete set of

properties of the popular red fluorescent protein mCherry. By examining the
charge transfer spectrum and combining it with the mCherry hole-electron

Quantitative analysis of charge transfer shows that, overall, the electrons are
transferred to the C16 atom in the middle of phenolate and the imidazolinone
loops during absorption. We speculate that C16 may also absorb protons to
enable the photoconversion of mCherry in the excited state, similar to the
blinking mechanism of IrisFP. In addition, we further investigated the optical
properties of mcherry in the external field by polarizability
(hyperpolarizability), showing the anisotropy of the polarization, the first
hyperpolarization and the second hyperpolarization by unit spherical
representation. Our results suggest that significant polarization and second
hyperpolarizability occur when the field direction and electron transfer
direction are aligned. We also analyzed the polarizability and first
hyperpolarizabilities for different external fields. The polarizability mutated
when the external field satisfies the S_0,min-> S_1 transition. Finally, the
study of the first hyperpolarizability shows that adjusting the appropriate
field can lead to a linear photoelectric effect or second harmonic generation
of mCherry. These studies have certain reference values for various red

similarity of the red fluorescent protein.

capability. Application scenarios are identified along the process life cycle.
Then a systematic literature review on conversational process modelling is
performed. The resulting taxonomy serves as input for the identification of
application scenarios for conversational process modelling, including
paraphrasing and improvement of process descriptions. The application scenarios
are evaluated for existing chatbots based on a real-world test set from the
higher education domain. It contains process descriptions as well as
corresponding process models, together with an assessment of the model quality.
Based on the literature and application scenario analyses, recommendations for
the usage (practical implications) and further development (research
directions) of conversational process modelling are derived.

in data traffic. Adaptive beamforming customized for the target location is
crucial, but existing solutions such as liquidcrystal spatial light modulators
and microelectromechanical systems require costly micro/nano manufacturing,
delicate alignment, and a high degree of mechanical stability. These challenges
reflect the fragility of integrating a fiber network with micro/nano mechanical
or photonic systems. Here, we realize low-cost, low-loss, and fiber-compatible
beamforming and continuous beam steering through controlled bending of a
multi-mode fiber that modifies its modal coupling, and use it to enable
flexible optical wireless communication at 10 Gb/s. By using the fiber modal
coupling as degrees of freedom rather than an impediment, this approach offers
a promising solution for flexible and cost-effective optical wireless
communication networks.

specific model of this modified theory to obtain exact solutions of the Noether

integrals of motion. We analyze the presence of viable and stable traversable
wormhole solutions corresponding to different redshift functions. In order to
determine whether this theory provides physically viable and stable wormhole
geometry or not, we check the graphical behavior of null energy constraint,
causality condition and adiabatic index for effective stress-energy tensor. It
is found that viable and stable traversable wormhole solutions exist in this

of multiple imaging modalities to achieve a comprehensive understanding of
investigated samples. For example, fluorescence microscopy provides unique
functional contrast by imaging only specifically labeled components, especially
in biological samples. However, the achievable structural information on the
sample in its full complexity is limited. Here, the intrinsic label-free carbon
contrast of water window soft X-ray microscopy can complement fluorescence
images in a correlative approach ultimately combining nanoscale structural
resolution with functional contrast. However, soft X-ray microscopes are
complex and elaborate, and typically require a large-scale synchrotron
radiation source due to the demanding photon flux requirements. Yet, with
modern high-power lasers it has become possible to generate sufficient photon
flux from laser-produced plasmas, thus enabling laboratory-based setups. Here,
we present a compact table-top soft X-ray microscope with an integrated
epifluorescence modality for 'in-situ' correlative imaging. Samples remain in
place when switching between modalities, ensuring identical measurement
conditions and avoiding sample alteration or destruction. We demonstrate our
new method by multimodal images of several exemplary samples ranging from
nanoparticles to various multicolor labeled cell types. A structural resolution
of down to 50 nm was reached.

during training. In pursuit of better quality, the model size and complexity
grow over time, which requires additional training data to avoid overfitting.
This model growth demands a large number of resources in data centers. Hence,
training efficiency is becoming considerably more important to keep the data
center power demand manageable. In Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRM),
sparse features capturing categorical inputs through embedding tables are the
major contributors to model size and require high memory bandwidth. In this
paper, we study the bandwidth requirement and locality of embedding tables in
real-world deployed models. We observe that the bandwidth requirement is not
uniform across different tables and that embedding tables show high temporal
locality. We then design MTrainS, which leverages heterogeneous memory,
including byte and block addressable Storage Class Memory for DLRM
hierarchically. MTrainS allows for higher memory capacity per node and
increases training efficiency by lowering the need to scale out to multiple
hosts in memory capacity bound use cases. By optimizing the platform memory
hierarchy, we reduce the number of nodes for training by 4-8X, saving power and
cost of training while meeting our target training performance.

Accepted at IEEE Intelligent Vehicle (IV) Symposium 2023",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semi-cooperative behaviors are intrinsic properties of human drivers and
should be considered for autonomous driving. In addition, new autonomous
planners can consider the social value orientation (SVO) of human drivers to
generate socially-compliant trajectories. Yet the overall impact on traffic
flow for this new class of planners remain to be understood. In this work, we
present study of implicit semi-cooperative driving where agents deploy a
game-theoretic version of iterative best response assuming knowledge of the
SVOs of other agents. We simulate nominal traffic flow and investigate whether
the proportion of prosocial agents on the road impact individual or system-wide
driving performance. Experiments show that the proportion of prosocial agents
has a minor impact on overall traffic flow and that benefits of
semi-cooperation disproportionally affect egoistic and high-speed drivers.

  Detection",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Noise has always been nonnegligible trouble in object detection by creating
confusion in model reasoning, thereby reducing the informativeness of the data.
It can lead to inaccurate recognition due to the shift in the observed pattern,
that requires a robust generalization of the models. To implement a general
vision model, we need to develop deep learning models that can adaptively
select valid information from multi-modal data. This is mainly based on two
reasons. Multi-modal learning can break through the inherent defects of
single-modal data, and adaptive information selection can reduce chaos in
multi-modal data. To tackle this problem, we propose a universal
uncertainty-aware multi-modal fusion model. It adopts a multi-pipeline loosely
coupled architecture to combine the features and results from point clouds and
images. To quantify the correlation in multi-modal information, we model the
uncertainty, as the inverse of data information, in different modalities and
embed it in the bounding box generation. In this way, our model reduces the
randomness in fusion and generates reliable output. Moreover, we conducted a
completed investigation on the KITTI 2D object detection dataset and its
derived dirty data. Our fusion model is proven to resist severe noise
interference like Gaussian, motion blur, and frost, with only slight
degradation. The experiment results demonstrate the benefits of our adaptive
fusion. Our analysis on the robustness of multi-modal fusion will provide
further insights for future research.

present a diffusion model that is conditioned on monthly averages of

critical issue for all cryoelectronic devices. Especially, arrays of
superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) could require more
than $10^6$ readout lines. Performing signal processing operations at low
temperatures could be a solution. Nanocryotrons, superconducting nanowire
three-terminal devices, are good candidates for integrating sensing and
electronics on the same technological platform as SNSPDs in photon-counting
applications. In this work, we demonstrated that it is possible to read out,
process, encode, and store the output of SNSPDs using exclusively
superconducting nanowires. In particular, we present the design and development
of a nanocryotron ripple counter that detects input voltage spikes and converts
the number of pulses to an $N$-digit value. The counting base can be tuned from
2 to higher values, enabling higher maximum counts without enlarging the
circuit. As a proof-of-principle, we first experimentally demonstrated the
building block of the counter, an integer-$N$ frequency divider with $N$
ranging from 2 to 5. Then, we demonstrated photon-counting operations at
405\,nm and 1550\,nm by coupling an SNSPD with a 2-digit nanocryotron counter
partially integrated on-chip. The 2-digit counter operated in either base 2 or
base 3 with a bit error rate lower than $2 \times 10^{-4}$ and a maximum count
rate of $45 \times 10^6\,$s$^{-1}$. We simulated circuit architectures for
integrated readout of the counter state, and we evaluated the capabilities of
reading out an SNSPD megapixel array that would collect up to $10^{12}$ counts
per second. The results of this work, combined with our recent publications on
a nanocryotron shift register and logic gates, pave the way for the development

utilizing the specifically designed hyper kernels, ingeniously converting the
original complex dual optimization problem into easily implemented one-tier

hierarchical multi-module search space whose candidate operations only contain
convolutions, and these operations can be integrated into unified kernels.
Using the above searching strategy and searching space, we obtain three kinds
of networks to separately conduct pixel-level or image-level classifications
with 1-D or 3-D convolutions. In addition, by combining the proposed hyper
kernel searching scheme with the 3-D convolution decomposition mechanism, we
obtain diverse architectures to simulate 3-D convolutions, greatly improving
network flexibilities. A series of quantitative and qualitative experiments on
six public datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve

wettability and fluid viscosities on immiscible fluid displacements in a
heterogeneous porous medium.We classify the flow regimes based using
qualitative and quantitative analysis into viscous fingering (low $M$), compact
displacement (high $M$), and an intermediate transition regime ($M \approx 1$).
We use stability analysis to obtain theoretical phase boundaries between these
regimes, which agree well with our analyses. At the macroscopic (sample) scale,
we find that wettability strongly controls the threshold $M$ (at which the
regimes change). At the pore scale, wettability alters the dominant
pore-filling mechanism. At very small $M$ (viscous fingering regime), smaller
pore spaces are preferentially invaded during imbibition, with flow of films of
invading fluid along the pore walls. In contrast, during drainage, bursts
result in filling of pores irrespective of their size. As $M$ increases, the
effect of wettability decreases as cooperative filling becomes the dominant
mechanism regardless of wettability. This suggest that for imbibition at a
given contact angle, decreasing $M$ is associated with change in effective
wetting from neutral-wet (cooperative filling) to strong-wet (film flow).

methods, evaluated in a cross-domain setting: for example, a model trained on
the source dataset (SemanticKITTI) obtains $26.53$ mIoU on the target data,
compared to $48.49$ mIoU obtained by the model trained on the target domain

Convolutional Tables (CT), to enable accelerated CPU-based inference.
Convolutional layers are the most time-consuming bottleneck in contemporary
deep learning techniques, severely limiting their use in Internet of Things and
CPU-based devices. The proposed CT performs a fern operation at each image
location: it encodes the location environment into a binary index and uses the
index to retrieve the desired local output from a table. The results of
multiple tables are combined to derive the final output. The computational
complexity of a CT transformation is independent of the patch (filter) size and
grows gracefully with the number of channels, outperforming comparable
convolutional layers. It is shown to have a better capacity:compute ratio than
dot-product neurons, and that deep CT networks exhibit a universal
approximation property similar to neural networks. As the transformation
involves computing discrete indices, we derive a soft relaxation and
gradient-based approach for training the CT hierarchy. Deep CT networks have
been experimentally shown to have accuracy comparable to that of CNNs of
similar architectures. In the low compute regime, they enable an error:speed

better than with stellar mass $M_{\ast}$, but also find that younger galaxies

mass-to-light ratio $M_{\ast}/L$ all decrease with galaxy rotation, while
radial gradients become more negative (i.e., younger, more metal-poor, and
lower $M_{\ast}/L$ in the outskirts). The trend between metallicity gradients
and rotation reverses for slow rotators, which stand out for their more
negative metallicity gradients than faster-rotating galaxies. We highlight a
population of massive disk galaxies on the green valley, on the $(\sigma_{\rm
e},\rm Age)$ plane, that show steep negative age and metallicity gradients,
consistent with their old central bulges surrounded by young star-forming disks
and metal-poor gas accretion. Galaxies with high $\sigma_{\rm e}$, steep total
mass-density slope, low dark matter fraction, high $M_{\ast}/L$, and high
metallicity have the highest star-formation rate at earlier times, and are
currently quenched. We discover a population of low-mass star-forming galaxies
with low rotation but physically distinct from the massive slow rotators. A

We show that the inclination-corrected mass plane (MP) for both early-type

projected half-light radius $R_{\rm e}$, and the second stellar velocity moment
$\sigma_{\rm e}$ within $R_{\rm e}$, satisfies the virial theorem and is even
tighter than the uncorrected one. We find a clear parabolic relation between
$\lg(M/L)(<R_{\rm e})$, the total mass-to-light ratio within a sphere of radius
$R_{\rm e}$, and $\lg\sigma_{\rm e}$, with the $M/L$ increasing with
$\sigma_{\rm e}$ and for older stellar populations. However, the relation for
ETGs is linear and the one for the youngest galaxies is constant. We confirm
and improve the relation between average logarithmic total density slopes
$\gamma_{_{\rm T}}$ and $\sigma_{\rm e}$: $\gamma_{_{\rm T}}$ become steeper
with increasing $\sigma_{\rm e}$ until $\lg(\sigma_{\rm e}/{\rm
km\,s^{-1}})\approx 2.2$ and then remain constant around $\gamma_{_{\rm

for LTGs than ETGs. At fixed $\sigma_{\rm e}$ the total density profiles
steepen with galaxy age and for ETGs. We find generally low dark matter
fractions, median $f_{\rm DM}(<R_{\rm e})=8$ per cent, within a sphere of
radius $R_{\rm e}$. However, we find that $f_{\rm DM}(<R_{\rm e})$ depends on
$\sigma_{\rm e}$ better than stellar mass: dark matter increases to a median
$f_{\rm DM}=33$ percent for galaxies with $\sigma_{\rm e}\lesssim100{\rm

construct lexical constraints by identifying important tokens from the document

final vocabulary likelihood. This lightweight approach requires no additional

involving logical operations, e.g., the intersection of two requirements, where
such requirements naturally form structured logical queries on knowledge graphs

users' complex logical requirements. In this work, we formulate the problem of
recommendation with users' logical requirements (LogicRec) and construct
benchmark datasets for LogicRec. Furthermore, we propose an initial solution
for LogicRec based on logical requirement retrieval and user preference
retrieval, where we face two challenges. First, KGs are incomplete in nature.
Therefore, there are always missing true facts, which entails that the answers
to logical requirements can not be completely found in KGs. In this case, item
selection based on the answers to logical queries is not applicable. We thus
resort to logical query embedding (LQE) to jointly infer missing facts and
retrieve items based on logical requirements. Second, answer sets are
under-exploited. Existing LQE methods can only deal with query-answer pairs,
where queries in our case are the intersected user preferences and logical
requirements. However, the logical requirements and user preferences have
different answer sets, offering us richer knowledge about the requirements and
preferences by providing requirement-item and preference-item pairs. Thus, we
design a multi-task knowledge-sharing mechanism to exploit these answer sets
collectively. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the significance of
the LogicRec task and the effectiveness of our proposed method.

column generation (CG) for the weighted set cover formulation of the
capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows (CVRPTW). We adapt two
new techniques, Local Area (LA) routes and Graph Master (GM) to these problems.
LA-routes rely on pre-computing all lowest cost elementary sub-routes, called
LA-arcs, where all customers but the final customer are localized in space.
LA-routes are constructed by concatenating LA-arcs where the final customer in
a given LA-arc is the first customer in the subsequent LA-arc. To construct the
lowest reduced cost elementary route during the pricing step of CG we apply a
Decremental State Space Relaxation/time window discretization method over time,
remaining demand, and customers visited; where the edges in the associated
pricing graph are LA-arcs. To accelerate the convergence of CG we use an
enhanced GM approach. We map each route generated during pricing to a strict
total ordering of all customers, that respects the ordering of customers in the
route; and somewhat preserves spatial locality. Each such strict total ordering
is then mapped to a multi-graph where each node is associated with a tuple of
customer, capacity remaining, and time remaining. Nodes are connected by
feasible LA-arcs when the first/last customers in the LA-arc are less/greater
than each intermediate customer (and each other) with respect to the total
order. The multi-graph of a given route can express that route and other
""related"" routes; and every path from source to sink describes a feasible
elementary route. Solving optimization over the restricted master problem over
all multi-graphs is done efficiently by constructing the relevant nodes/edges
on demand.

imposed on a spherical-cap, sessile gas bubble pinned on to a rigid wall can
produce a sharp, wall-directed jet. For such a bubble filled with a permanent
gas, the temporal spectrum for surface tension driven, linearised perturbations
has been studied recently in \cite{ding2022oscillations} in the potential flow
limit. We test these predictions against numerical simulations of the inviscid,
incompressible, Euler's equation with surface tension
\citep{popinet2014basilisk}. The bubble surface is deformed initially as a
shape eigenmode and this is evolved in time. At small modal amplitude, the
resulting standing waves show very good agreement with theory, both for
axisymmetric and three-dimensional modes. In contrast, when the bubble is
evolved temporally from a large amplitude initial distortion, we observe the
formation of a sharp dimple at the symmetry axis. This is the precursor to a
slender, wall-directed jet, as the distortion amplitude is increased further.
We find dimples which eject with instantaneous velocities exceeding fifteen
times that predicted from linear theory. These form via capillary wave
focussing, analogous to their free-surface counterparts
\citep{duchemin2002jet}. At sufficiently large distortion amplitude and in a
small time window after the birth of the dimple, the temporal evolution of the
jet occurs self-similarly following \cite{keller1983surface} scales. Our
results complement \cite{naude1961mechanism,plesset1971collapse} demonstrating
that wall-directed jets may be generated from volume conserving, shape
deformations of a pinned, sessile bubble.

Predictions resulting from applying ML models are often used for inference,

aspect of ML is uncertainty quantification, which can significantly impact how
predictions from models are used and interpreted.
  Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is one of the most popular ML methods
given its simple implementation, fast computation, and sequential learning,
which make its predictions highly accurate compared to other methods. However,
techniques for uncertainty determination in ML models such as XGBoost have not
yet been universally agreed among its varying applications. We propose
enhancements to XGBoost whereby a modified quantile regression is used as the
objective function to estimate uncertainty (QXGBoost). Specifically, we
included the Huber norm in the quantile regression model to construct a
differentiable approximation to the quantile regression error function. This
key step allows XGBoost, which uses a gradient-based optimization algorithm, to
make probabilistic predictions efficiently.
  QXGBoost was applied to create 90\% prediction intervals for one simulated
dataset and one real-world environmental dataset of measured traffic noise. Our
proposed method had comparable or better performance than the uncertainty
estimates generated for regular and quantile light gradient boosting. For both
the simulated and traffic noise datasets, the overall performance of the
prediction intervals from QXGBoost were better than other models based on
coverage width-based criterion.

investigate the ground state properties of a two-leg Bose-Hubbard ladder by
imposing three-body constraint in one leg and hardcore constraint in the other.
By using the cluster-mean-field theory approximation and the density matrix
renormalization group method, we show that at unit filling, for strong two-body
attraction among the three-body constrained bosons, the system becomes a gapped
pair-Mott insulator where all the bosons form strong bound pairs and occupy the
leg with three-body constraint. With increase in hopping strength this
pair-Mott insulator phase undergoes a phase transition to the gapless
superfluid phase for equal leg and rung hopping strengths. However, when the
rung hopping is stronger compared to the leg hopping, we obtain a crossover to
another gapped phase which is called the rung-Mott insulator phase where the
bosons prefer to delocalize on the rungs than the legs. By moving away from
unit filling, the system remains in the superfluid phase except for a small
region below the gapped phase where a pair superfluid phase is stabilized in
the regime of strong attractive interaction. We further extend our studies by
considering three-body constraint on both the legs and find that the crossover
from the gapped to gapped phase does not occur rather the system undergoes a
transition from a pair-rung-Mott insulator phase to the superfluid phase at
unit filling. Moreover, in this case we find the signature of the pair
superfluid phase on either sides of this gapped phase.

- a process called depth-k pooling. A standard practice is to set the depth (k)
to a constant value for each query constituting the benchmark set. However, in
this paper we argue that the annotation effort can be substantially reduced if
the depth of the pool is made a variable quantity for each query, the rationale
being that the number of documents relevant to the information need can widely
vary across queries. Our hypothesis is that a lower depth for the former class
of queries and a higher depth for the latter can potentially reduce the
annotation effort without a significant change in retrieval effectiveness
evaluation. We make use of standard query performance prediction (QPP)
techniques to estimate the number of potentially relevant documents for each
query, which is then used to determine the depth of the pool. Our experiments
conducted on standard test collections demonstrate that this proposed method of
employing query-specific variable depths is able to adequately reflect the
relative effectiveness of IR systems with a substantially smaller annotation
effort.

transparent (e.g., legible, explainable) robots intentionally choose actions
that convey their internal state to nearby humans. But while transparent
behavior seems beneficial, is it actually optimal? In this paper we consider
collaborative settings where the human and robot have the same objective, and
the human is uncertain about the robot's type (i.e., the robot's internal
state). We extend a recursive combination of Bayesian Nash equilibrium and the
Bellman equation to solve for optimal robot policies. Interestingly, we
discover that it is not always optimal for collaborative robots to be
transparent; instead, human and robot teams can sometimes achieve higher
rewards when the robot is opaque. Opaque robots select the same actions
regardless of their internal state: because each type of opaque robot behaves
in the same way, the human cannot infer the robot's type. Our analysis suggests
that opaque behavior becomes optimal when either (a) human-robot interactions
have a short time horizon or (b) users are slow to learn from the robot's
actions. Across online and in-person user studies with 43 total participants,
we find that users reach higher rewards when working with opaque partners, and
subjectively rate opaque robots as about equal to transparent robots. See

  Uncertain Data","V2",,,,"cs.SI stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In the quest to improve services, companies offer customers the opportunity
to interact with agents through contact centers, where the communication is
mainly text-based. This has become one of the favorite channels of
communication with companies in recent years. However, contact centers face
operational challenges, since the measurement of common proxies for customer
experience, such as knowledge of whether customers have abandoned the queue and
their willingness to wait for service (patience), are subject to information
uncertainty. We focus this research on the impact of a main source of such
uncertainty: silent abandonment by customers. These customers leave the system
while waiting for a reply to their inquiry, but give no indication of doing so,
such as closing the mobile app of the interaction. As a result, the system is
unaware that they have left and waste agent time and capacity until this fact
is realized. In this paper, we show that 30%-67% of the abandoning customers
abandon the system silently, and that such customer behavior reduces system
efficiency by 5%-15%. To do so, we develop methodologies to identify
silent-abandonment customers in two types of contact centers: chat and
messaging systems. We first use text analysis and an SVM model to estimate the
actual abandonment level. We then use a parametric estimator and develop an
expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate customer patience accurately, as
customer patience is an important parameter for fitting queueing models to the
data. We show how accounting for silent abandonment in a queueing model
improves dramatically the estimation accuracy of key measures of performance.
Finally, we suggest strategies to operationally cope with the phenomenon of
silent abandonment.

rate exceeding 26%, requires a large transmission capacity increment from the
fiber optical infrastructure. As the deploy of new fiber cables requires
extensive investments, the development of multi-band amplifiers and
transceivers, already available as prototypes, is progressively considered
towards the entire low-loss single-mode bandwidth beyond the 5 THz C-band. In
this perspective, an adequate handling of the variations along the frequency of
the fiber physical features becomes crucial for the fiber propagation modeling
in multi-band wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) channel comb transmission
scenarios. In particular, the inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (SRS)
is the fundamental inter-band effect in this context. The SRS effect on the WDM
comb propagated through a single-mode optical fiber is described by a set of
ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To date, an exact solution of the SRS
ODEs has not been proposed, and in the literature numerical solutions or
approximations have been considered in order to take into account this effect.
In this work, a perturbative solution of the SRS ODEs is presented enabling an
efficient trade-off between the target accuracy and the computational time.
Considering a C+L+S transmission scenario, the perturbative expansion up to the
2nd order ensures an excellent accuracy. Whereas, in an U-to-E transmission
scenario, the 3rd order is required in order to reach an equivalent accuracy.

critical step in achieving decent quality of results (QoR). Moreover, in
today's physical synthesis flows (e.g., Synopsys Fusion Compiler or Cadence
Genus iSpatial), a floorplan .def with macro and IO pin placements is typically
needed as an input to the front-end physical synthesis. Recently, with the
increasing complexity of IP blocks, and in particular with auto-generated RTL
for machine learning (ML) accelerators, the number of hard macros in a single
RTL block can easily run into the several hundreds. This makes the task of
generating an automatic floorplan (.def) with IO pin and macro placements for
front-end physical synthesis even more critical and challenging. The so-called
peripheral approach of forcing macros to the periphery of the layout is no
longer viable when the ratio of the sum of the macro perimeters to the
floorplan perimeter is large, since this increases the required stacking depth
of macros. In this paper, we develop a novel multilevel physical planning
approach that exploits the hierarchy and dataflow inherent in the design RTL,
and describe its realization in a new hierarchical macro placer, Hier-RTLMP.
Hier-RTLMP borrows from traditional approaches used in manual system-on-chip
(SoC) floorplanning to create an automatic macro placement for use with large
IP blocks containing very large numbers of hard macros. Empirical studies
demonstrate substantial improvements over the previous RTL-MP macro placement
approach, and promising post-route improvements relative to a leading

models with reduced computation and memory storage requirements - that can be
embedded on these devices. However, tinyML models have lower inference
accuracy. On a different front, DNN partitioning and inference offloading
techniques were studied for distributed DL inference between EDs and Edge
Servers (ESs). In this paper, we explore Hierarchical Inference (HI), a novel
approach proposed by Vishnu et al. 2023, arXiv:2304.00891v1 , for performing
distributed DL inference at the edge. Under HI, for each data sample, an ED
first uses a local algorithm (e.g., a tinyML model) for inference. Depending on
the application, if the inference provided by the local algorithm is incorrect
or further assistance is required from large DL models on edge or cloud, only
then the ED offloads the data sample. At the outset, HI seems infeasible as the
ED, in general, cannot know if the local inference is sufficient or not.
Nevertheless, we present the feasibility of implementing HI for machine fault
detection and image classification applications. We demonstrate its benefits
using quantitative analysis and argue that using HI will result in low latency,
bandwidth savings, and energy savings in edge AI systems.

the Nan\c{c}ay Radioheliograh that measure the properties of the radio source.
The BBPs start $\sim$24 min before the flare onset, extending from $<$ 360 to
above 800 MHz with no discernible spectral drift. The BBPs consist of two
stages, during the first stage the main source remains stationary, during the
second stage it moves outward along with a steepening extreme-ultraviolet (EUV)
wave driven by the eruption of a high-temperature structure. In both stages, we
observe frequent EUV brightenings and jets originating from the flare region.
During the second stage, the BBPs become denser in number and stronger in
general, with the level of the polarization increasing gradually from $<$ 20%
to $>$ 60% in the right-handed sense. These observations indicate the
steepening EUV wave is important to the BBPs during the second stage, while the
preflare reconnections causing the jets and EUV brightenings are important in
both stages. This is the first time such a strong association of an EUV wave
with BBPs is reported. We suggest a reconnection plus
shock-sweeping-across-loop scenario for the cause of the BBPs.

attractive Gaussian potentials for the two symmetric spin-$\uparrow$ and

frequency f increases, two distinct critical dynamics arise in the generation
of half-quantum vortices (HQVs) with different spin circulations.
Spin-$\uparrow$ vortices are nucleated directly from the moving obstacle at low
f, while spin-$\downarrow$ vortices are created at high f by breaking a spin
wave pulse in front of the obstacle. We find that vortex generation is
suppressed for sufficiently weak obstacles, in agreement with recent
experimental results by Kim et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 095302 (2021)]. This
suppression is caused by the finite sweeping distance of the oscillating
obstacle and the reduction in friction in a supersonic regime. Finally, we show
that the characteristic length scale of the HQV generation dynamics is
determined by the spin healing length of the system.

  Drive Electric Vehicle Based on AMPC and DYC",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Maintaining both path-tracking accuracy and yaw stability of distributed
drive electric vehicles (DDEVs) under various driving conditions presents a
significant challenge in the field of vehicle control. To address this
limitation, a coordinated control strategy that integrates adaptive model
predictive control (AMPC) path-tracking control and direct yaw moment control
(DYC) is proposed for DDEVs. The proposed strategy, inspired by a hierarchical
framework, is coordinated by the upper layer of path-tracking control and the
lower layer of direct yaw moment control. Based on the linear time-varying
model predictive control (LTV MPC) algorithm, the effects of prediction horizon
and weight coefficients on the path-tracking accuracy and yaw stability of the
vehicle are compared and analyzed first. According to the aforementioned
analysis, an AMPC path-tracking controller with variable prediction horizon and
weight coefficients is designed considering the vehicle speed's variation in
the upper layer. The lower layer involves DYC based on the linear quadratic
regulator (LQR) technique. Specifically, the intervention rule of DYC is
determined by the threshold of the yaw rate error and the phase diagram of the
sideslip angle. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the
proposed coordinated control strategy under different driving conditions. The
results show that, under variable speed and low adhesion conditions, the
vehicle's yaw stability and path-tracking accuracy have been improved by
21.58\% and 14.43\%, respectively, compared to AMPC. Similarly, under high
speed and low adhesion conditions, the vehicle's yaw stability and
path-tracking accuracy have been improved by 44.30\% and 14.25\%, respectively,
compared to the coordination of LTV MPC and DYC. The results indicate that the
proposed adaptive path-tracking controller is effective across different
speeds.

constrained action space of the task; (2) extraction of a state alignment-based
reward function from a single demonstration video; (3) real-time optimization
of the imitation policy under systematic safety constraints with sampling-based

imitation-from-video strategy that simplifies the learning and execution of
robot skills in real applications. Specifically, we learn priors in a scene of
a task family and then deploy the policy in a novel scene immediately following
a single demonstration, preventing time-consuming and risky explorations in the

between the scenes, learning priors can be conducted in simulation to avoid
collecting data in real-world circumstances. We evaluate the effectiveness of
our approach in the context of contact-rich fabric manipulation, which is a

similar to background in all three types of solar wind. The properties of
hot-SFRs and cold-SFRs seem to be lying in two extremes. Statistically, the
hot-SFRs (cold-SFRs) are associated with longer (shorter) duration, lower
(higher) speeds and proton temperatures, higher (lower) charge states, helium
abundance, and FIP bias as compared with normal-SFRs and background solar wind.
The anti-correlations between speed and O7+/O6+ inside hot-SFRs (normal-SFRs)
are different from (similar to) those in background solar wind. Most of
hot-SFRs and cold-SFRs should come from the Sun. Hot-SFRs may come from
streamers associated with plasma blobs and/or small-scale activities on the

Compared to occlusion in natural scene images, occlusion in UAV images happens

found that extracting or localizing occlusion between objects is beneficial for
the detector to address this challenge. According to this finding, the
occlusion localization task is introduced, which together with the object
detection task constitutes our occlusion-guided multi-task network (OGMN). The
OGMN contains the localization of occlusion and two occlusion-guided multi-task
interactions. In detail, an occlusion estimation module (OEM) is proposed to
precisely localize occlusion. Then the OGMN utilizes the occlusion localization
results to implement occlusion-guided detection with two multi-task

address the feature confusion problem, and an occlusion decoupling head (ODH)
is proposed to replace the general detection head. Another interaction for
guide is designed in the detection process according to local aggregation
characteristic, and a two-phase progressive refinement process (TPP) is
proposed to optimize the detection process. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our OGMN on the Visdrone and UAVDT datasets. In
particular, our OGMN achieves 35.0% mAP on the Visdrone dataset and outperforms
the baseline by 5.3%. And our OGMN provides a new insight for accurate

challenge for Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants. Soiling can vary
significantly from site to site -- from fractions of a percent to several
percentage points per day (pp/day), a fact that has motivated several studies
in soiling predictive modelling. Yet, existing studies have so far neglected
the characterization of statistical uncertainty in their parameters and
predictions. In this paper, two reflectance loss models are proposed that model
uncertainty: an extension of a previously developed physical model and a
simplified model. A novel uncertainty characterization enables Maximum
Likelihood Estimation techniques for parameter estimation for both models, and
permits the estimation of parameter (and prediction) confidence intervals.
  The models are applied to data from ten soiling campaigns conducted at three
Australian sites (Brisbane, Mount Isa, Wodonga). The simplified model produces
high-quality predictions of soiling losses on novel data, while the
semi-physical model performance is mixed. The statistical distributions of
daily losses were estimated for different dust loadings. Under median
conditions, the daily soiling losses for Brisbane, Mount Isa, and Wodonga are
estimated as $0.53 \pm 0.62$, $0.1 \pm 0.1$, and $0.57 \pm 0.14$ pp/day,
respectively. Yet, higher observed dust loadings can drive average losses as
high as $2.50$ pp/day.
  Overall, the results suggest a relatively simple approach characterizing the
statistical distributions of soiling losses using airborne dust measurements
and short reflectance monitoring campaigns.

expectation maximization algorithm where we make use of the sequential minimal
optimization technique together with the Platt scaling method to obtain the
posterior probabilities of cured/uncured. A detailed simulation study shows
that the proposed model outperforms the existing logistic regression-based PCM
model as well as the spline regression-based PCM model, which is also known to
capture non linearity in the data. This is true in terms of bias and mean
square error of different quantities of interest, and also in terms of
predictive and classification accuracies of cure. Finally, we illustrate the

training methods for traditional classification, we use MP-based approximation
for training, including backpropagation mitigating approximation errors. The
proposed framework is general enough for acoustic classification. However, we
demonstrate the hardware friendliness of this framework by implementing a
parallel Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter bank in a kernel machine
classifier optimized for a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The FIR filter
acts as the feature extractor and non-linear kernel for the kernel machine
implemented using MP approximation and a downsampling method to reduce the

heterogeneous human agents in close proximity. One of these challenges is that
the autonomous agent does not have an accurate model tailored to the specific
human that the autonomous agent is interacting with, which could sometimes
result in inefficient human-robot interaction and suboptimal system dynamics.
Developing an online method to enable the autonomous agent to learn information
about the human model is therefore an ongoing research goal. Existing
approaches position the robot as a passive learner in the environment to
observe the physical states and the associated human response. This passive
design, however, only allows the robot to obtain information that the human
chooses to exhibit, which sometimes doesn't capture the human's full intention.
In this work, we present an online optimization-based probing procedure for the
autonomous agent to clarify its belief about the human model in an active
manner. By optimizing an information radius, the autonomous agent chooses the
action that most challenges its current conviction. This procedure allows the
autonomous agent to actively probe the human agents to reveal information
that's previously unavailable to the autonomous agent. With this gathered
information, the autonomous agent can interactively influence the human agent
for some designated objectives. Our main contributions include a coherent
theoretical framework that unifies the probing and influence procedures and two
case studies in autonomous driving that show how active probing can help to
create better participant experience during influence, like higher efficiency

transfer recently thanks to its global receptive field and powerful

multi-layer structure increases parameters significantly and thus presents a
heavy burden for training. Moreover, for the task of style transfer, vanilla
Transformer that fuses content and style features by residual connections is
prone to content-wise distortion. In this paper, we devise a novel Transformer
model termed as \emph{Master} specifically for style transfer. On the one hand,
in the proposed model, different Transformer layers share a common group of
parameters, which (1) reduces the total number of parameters, (2) leads to more
robust training convergence, and (3) is readily to control the degree of
stylization via tuning the number of stacked layers freely during inference. On
the other hand, different from the vanilla version, we adopt a learnable
scaling operation on content features before content-style feature interaction,
which better preserves the original similarity between a pair of content
features while ensuring the stylization quality. We also propose a novel meta
learning scheme for the proposed model so that it can not only work in the
typical setting of arbitrary style transfer, but also adaptable to the few-shot
setting, by only fine-tuning the Transformer encoder layer in the few-shot
stage for one specific style. Text-guided few-shot style transfer is firstly
achieved with the proposed framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the

phases of matter, ranging from unconventional superconductivity and quantum

Here, we combine angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, phonon mode
calculation, and chemical doping to elucidate the driving mechanism of the
root3*root3 charge order in a newly discovered kagome metal ScV6Sn6. In
contrast to the case of the archetype kagome system AV3Sb5 (A= K, Rb, Cs), the
van Hove singularities in ScV6Sn6 remain intact across the charge order
transition, indicating a marginal role of the electronic instability from the V
kagome lattice. Instead, we identified a three-dimensional band with dominant
planar Sn character opening a large charge order gap of 260 meV and strongly
reconstructing the Fermi surface. Our complementary phonon dispersion
calculations further emphasize the role of the structural components other than
the V kagome lattice by revealing the unstable planar Sn and Sc phonon modes
associated to the root3*root3 phase. Finally, in the constructed phase diagram
of Sc(V1-xCrx)6Sn6, the charge order remains robust in a wide doping range x =
0 ~ 0.10 against the Fermi level shift up to ~ 120 meV, further making the
electronic scenarios such as Fermi surface or saddle point nesting unlikely.
Our multimodal investigations demonstrate that the physics of ScV6Sn6 is
fundamentally different from the canonical kagome metal AV3Sb5, uncovering a
new mechanism to induce symmetry-breaking phase transition in kagome lattice

neural network's operation on different dimensions is usually anisotropic,
i.e., perturbations with the same 2-norm but in different dimensions of
intermediate features lead to changes in the final output with largely
different magnitude. Considering this, we argue that the similarity between

appearance (i.e., L2 distance), but should, more importantly, be measured by
their difference in function, namely how later layers of the network will read,
decode, and process them. Therefore, we propose Function-Consistent Feature
Distillation (FCFD), which explicitly optimizes the functional similarity
between teacher and student features. The core idea of FCFD is to make teacher

similar outputs when fed to the later part of the same network. With FCFD, the
student mimics the teacher more faithfully and learns more from the teacher.

  Mobile Telepresence","Accepted by CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Real-time and robust photorealistic avatars for telepresence in AR/VR have
been highly desired for enabling immersive photorealistic telepresence.
However, there still exists one key bottleneck: the considerable computational
expense needed to accurately infer facial expressions captured from
headset-mounted cameras with a quality level that can match the realism of the
avatar's human appearance. To this end, we propose a framework called
Auto-CARD, which for the first time enables real-time and robust driving of
Codec Avatars when exclusively using merely on-device computing resources. This
is achieved by minimizing two sources of redundancy. First, we develop a
dedicated neural architecture search technique called AVE-NAS for avatar
encoding in AR/VR, which explicitly boosts both the searched architectures'
robustness in the presence of extreme facial expressions and hardware
friendliness on fast evolving AR/VR headsets. Second, we leverage the temporal
redundancy in consecutively captured images during continuous rendering and
develop a mechanism dubbed LATEX to skip the computation of redundant frames.
Specifically, we first identify an opportunity from the linearity of the latent
space derived by the avatar decoder and then propose to perform adaptive latent
extrapolation for redundant frames. For evaluation, we demonstrate the efficacy
of our Auto-CARD framework in real-time Codec Avatar driving settings, where we
achieve a 5.05x speed-up on Meta Quest 2 while maintaining a comparable or even
better animation quality than state-of-the-art avatar encoder designs.

merger in scalar-tensor (ST) gravity with binary parameters consistent with the

the Damour-Esposito-Farese extension to Brans-Dicke theory, and maximize the
effect of spontaneous scalarization by choosing a soft equation of state and ST
theory parameters at the edge of known constraints. We extrapolate the
gravitational waves, including tensor and scalar (breathing) modes, to future
null-infinity. The numerical waveforms undergo ~ 22 wave cycles before the
merger, and are in good agreement with predictions from post-Newtonian theory
during the inspiral. We find the ST system evolves faster than its
general-relativity (GR) counterpart due to dipole radiation, merging a full
gravitational-wave cycle before the GR counterpart. This enables easy
differentiation between the ST waveforms and GR in the context of parameter
estimation. However, we find that dipole radiation's effect may be partially
degenerate with the NS tidal deformability during the late inspiral stage, and
a full Bayesian analysis is necessary to fully understand the degeneracies
between ST and binary parameters in GR.

multirotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). While conventional multirotors can
barely handle this issue due to underactuation, over-actuated platforms can
still pursue the flight with proper fault-tolerant control (FTC). This paper
investigates such a controller for one such over-actuated multirotor aerial
platform composing quadcopters mounted on passive joints with input redundancy
in both the high-level vehicle control and the low-level quadcopter control of
vectored thrusts. To fully utilize the input redundancies of the whole platform
under propeller failure, our proposed FTC controller has a hierarchical control
architecture with three main components: (i) a low-level adjustment strategy to
avoid propeller-level thrust saturation; (ii) a compensation loop to attenuate
introduced disturbance; (iii) a nullspace-based control allocation framework to
avoid quadcopter-level thrust saturation. Through reallocating actuator inputs
in both the low-level and high-level control loops, the low-level quadcopter
control can be maintained with at most two failed propellers and the whole
platform can be stabilized without crashing. The proposed controller is
extensively studied in both simulation and real-world experiments to
demonstrate its superior performance.

determination for stochastic simulated annealing (SSA). SSA is capable of
solving combinatorial optimization problems faster than typical simulated

proposed method determines hyperparameters based on the local energy
distributions of spins (probabilistic bits). The spin is a basic computing
element of SSA and is graphically connected to other spins with its weights.
The distribution of the local energy can be estimated based on the central
limit theorem (CLT). The CLT-based normal distribution is used to determine the
hyperparameters, which reduces the time complexity for hyperparameter search
from O(n^3) of the conventional method to O(1). The performance of SSA with the
determined hyperparameters is evaluated on the Gset and K2000 benchmarks for
maximum-cut problems. The results show that the proposed method achieves mean

Memory-based methods have recently achieved outstanding VOS performance by
performing non-local pixel-wise matching between the query and memory. However,
these methods have two limitations. 1) Non-local matching could cause
distractor objects in the background to be incorrectly segmented. 2) Memory
features with high temporal redundancy consume significant computing resources.
For limitation 1, we introduce a local attention mechanism that tackles the
background distraction by enhancing the features of foreground objects with the
previous mask. For limitation 2, we first adaptively decide whether to update
the memory features depending on the variation of foreground objects to reduce
temporal redundancy. Second, we employ a dynamic memory bank, which uses a
lightweight and differentiable soft modulation gate to decide how many memory

that our REMN achieves state-of-the-art results on DAVIS 2017, with a

threat is to strategically modify one's publicly available data in order to
keep one's private information hidden from attribute inference. We evaluate
people's ability to perform this task, and compare it against algorithms
designed for this purpose. We focus on three attributes: the gender of the
author of a piece of text, the country in which a set of photos was taken, and
the link missing from a social network. For each of these attributes, we find
that people's effectiveness is inferior to that of AI, especially when it comes

  Adversarial Networks with Measuring Uncertainty","11 pages, 3 figures, and one table",,,,"q-fin.PM cs.CE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In financial engineering, portfolio optimization has been of consistent
interest. Portfolio optimization is a process of modulating asset distributions
to maximize expected returns and minimize risks. To obtain the expected
returns, deep learning models have been explored in recent years. However, due
to the deterministic nature of the models, it is difficult to consider the risk
of portfolios because conventional deep learning models do not know how
reliable their predictions can be. To address this limitation, this paper
proposes a probabilistic model, namely predictive auxiliary classifier
generative adversarial networks (PredACGAN). The proposed PredACGAN utilizes
the characteristic of the ACGAN framework in which the output of the generator
forms a distribution. While ACGAN has not been employed for predictive models
and is generally utilized for image sample generation, this paper proposes a
method to use the ACGAN structure for a probabilistic and predictive model.
Additionally, an algorithm to use the risk measurement obtained by PredACGAN is
proposed. In the algorithm, the assets that are predicted to be at high risk
are eliminated from the investment universe at the rebalancing moment.
Therefore, PredACGAN considers both return and risk to optimize portfolios. The
proposed algorithm and PredACGAN have been evaluated with daily close price
data of S&P 500 from 1990 to 2020. Experimental scenarios are assumed to
rebalance the portfolios monthly according to predictions and risk measures
with PredACGAN. As a result, a portfolio using PredACGAN exhibits 9.123% yearly
returns and a Sharpe ratio of 1.054, while a portfolio without considering risk
measures shows 1.024% yearly returns and a Sharpe ratio of 0.236 in the same
scenario. Also, the maximum drawdown of the proposed portfolio is lower than
the portfolio without PredACGAN.

develop a dual-path spiking spatially-adaptive modulation (SSAM) block to
enhance the representation of sparse events, significantly improving network

Is epidemic data, particularly COVID-19 epidemic data, clean and devoid of

the data for the presence of reporting delays. In our work, through the

the published epidemic data. Motivated by the desire to enhance epidemic
forecasts, we develop a statistical framework to detect, uncover, and remove
reporting delays in the infectious, recovered, and deceased epidemic time

removing reporting delays from epidemic data using our statistical framework

recently was introduced for boundaries discretized using composite
Gauss-Legendre quadrature. The original method builds on swapping the target
singularity for its preimage in the complexified space of the curve
parametrization, where the source panel is flat. This allows the integral to be
efficiently evaluated using an interpolatory quadrature with a monomial basis.
In this extension, we use the target preimage to swap the singularity to a
point close to the unit circle. This allows us to evaluate the integral using
an interpolatory quadrature with complex exponential basis functions. This is
well-conditioned, and can be efficiently evaluated using the fast Fourier
transform. The resulting method has exponential convergence, and can be used to
accurately evaluate layer potentials close to the source geometry. We report
experimental results on a simple test geometry, and provide a baseline Julia
implementation that can be used for further experimentation.

The ability to detect potentially dangerous interactions from on-bike sensing

automated detection of conflict between cyclists and drivers has attracted
researchers from both computer vision and road safety communities. In this
paper, we introduce a novel benchmark, called Cyc-CP, towards cycling close
pass near miss event detection from video streams. We first divide this task
into scene-level and instance-level problems. Scene-level detection asks an
algorithm to predict whether there is a close pass near miss event in the input
video clip. Instance-level detection aims to detect which vehicle in the scene
gives rise to a close pass near miss. We propose two benchmark models based on
deep learning techniques for these two problems. For training and testing those
models, we construct a synthetic dataset and also collect a real-world dataset.
Our models can achieve 88.13% and 84.60% accuracy on the real-world dataset,
respectively. We envision this benchmark as a test-bed to accelerate cycling
close pass near miss detection and facilitate interaction between the fields of
road safety, intelligent transportation systems and artificial intelligence.

assume that a multi-antenna base station (BS) receives the OFDM symbols from
single-antenna users reflected by multiple RISs and tracks the positions of
these users. Considering the users' mobility and the blockage of light-of-sight

at or close to its resonance frequency. Closed-loop systems can continually
check whether the resonator is at resonance and accordingly adjust the
frequency of the driving signal. In this work, we study three resonance
frequency tracking schemes, a feedback-free (FF), a self-sustaining oscillator
(SSO), and a phase-locked loop oscillator (PLLO) scheme. We improve and extend
the theoretical models for the FF and the SSO tracking schemes, and test the
models experimentally with a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) resonator. We
employ a SSO architecture with a pulsed positive feedback topology and compare
it to the commonly used PLLO and FF schemes. We show that all tracking schemes
are theoretically equivalent and that they all are subject to the same speed
versus accuracy trade-off characteristics. In order to verify the theoretical
models, we present experimental steady-state measurements for all tracking
schemes. Frequency stability is characterized by computing the Allan deviation.
We obtain almost perfect correspondence between the theoretical models and the

out analytical and numerical calculations considering realistic tidal forcing

physically meaningful results, but may struggle with identifying the correct

is obtained by first applying the direct scaling to find the correct set of
confinement dimensionalities and subsequently employing clustering to refine
the results. Moreover, our model-based algorithm outperforms the standard
k-means++ clustering.

many-body Schr\""odinger operators at two-cluster thresholds. While the two-body
problem (reduced after separation of the center of mass motion to a one-body
problem at zero energy) is a well-studied subject, the literature on the
many-body problem is sparse. However our analysis covers for example the system
of three particles interacting by Coulomb potentials and restricted to a small
energy region to the right of a fixed nonzero two-body eigenvalue $\lambda_0$.
In general we address the question: How does scattering quantities for the
many-body atomic and molecular models behave in the limit when the total energy
approaches a fixed two-cluster threshold $\lambda_0$? This includes mapping
properties and singularities of the limiting scattering matrix, asymptotics of
the total scattering cross-section and absence of transmission from one channel
to another in the small inter-cluster kinetic energy region. Our principal
tools are the Feshbach-Grushin dimension reduction method and spectral analysis
based on a certain Mourre estimate. Additional topics (of independent interest)
are the limiting absorption principle, micro-local resolvent estimates, Rellich
and Sommerfeld type theorems and asymptotics of the limiting resolvents at
thresholds. While all of these features are fairly well-understood for two-body
Schr\""odinger operators, they are poorly understood in the many-body case even
for two-cluster thresholds. It is the goal of the book to remedy this point.
The mathematical physics field under study is very rich, and there are many

applications that involve complex data structures. MIL can be broadly
categorized into two types: traditional methods and those based on deep
learning. These approaches have yielded significant results, especially with
regards to their problem-solving strategies and experimental validation,
providing valuable insights for researchers in the MIL field. However, a
considerable amount of knowledge is often trapped within the algorithm, leading
to subsequent MIL algorithms that solely rely on the model's data fitting to
predict unlabeled samples. This results in a significant loss of knowledge and
impedes the development of more intelligent models. In this paper, we propose a
novel data-driven knowledge fusion for deep multi-instance learning (DKMIL)
algorithm. DKMIL adopts a completely different idea from existing deep MIL
methods by analyzing the decision-making of key samples in the data set
(referred to as the data-driven) and using the knowledge fusion module designed
to extract valuable information from these samples to assist the model's
training. In other words, this module serves as a new interface between data
and the model, providing strong scalability and enabling the use of prior
knowledge from existing algorithms to enhance the learning ability of the
model. Furthermore, to adapt the downstream modules of the model to more
knowledge-enriched features extracted from the data-driven knowledge fusion
module, we propose a two-level attention module that gradually learns shallow-
and deep-level features of the samples to achieve more effective
classification. We will prove the scalability of the knowledge fusion module
while also verifying the efficacy of the proposed architecture by conducting
experiments on 38 data sets across 6 categories.

tasks, including monocular 2D/3D detection and surround-view 3D detection.
However, when used in essential and classic stereo 3D object detection,
directly adopting those surround-view Transformers leads to slow convergence
and significant precision drops. We argue that one of the causes of this defect
is that the surround-view Transformers do not consider the stereo-specific
image correspondence information. In a surround-view system, the overlapping
areas are small, and thus correspondence is not a primary issue. In this paper,
we explore the model design of vision Transformers in stereo 3D object
detection, focusing particularly on extracting and encoding the task-specific
image correspondence information. To achieve this goal, we present TS3D, a
Transformer-based Stereo-aware 3D object detector. In the TS3D, a
Disparity-Aware Positional Encoding (DAPE) model is proposed to embed the image
correspondence information into stereo features. The correspondence is encoded
as normalized disparity and is used in conjunction with sinusoidal 2D
positional encoding to provide the location information of the 3D scene. To
extract enriched multi-scale stereo features, we propose a Stereo Reserving
Feature Pyramid Network (SRFPN). The SRFPN is designed to reserve the
correspondence information while fusing intra-scale and aggregating cross-scale
stereo features. Our proposed TS3D achieves a 41.29% Moderate Car detection

schedules. Machine learning can support this objective by predicting throughput
times on production lines given order specifications. However, this is
challenging when manufacturers produce customized products because
customization often leads to changes in the probability distribution of
operational data -- so-called distributional shifts. Distributional shifts can
harm the performance of predictive models when deployed to future customer
orders with new specifications. The literature provides limited advice on how
such distributional shifts can be addressed in operations management. Here, we
propose a data-driven approach based on adversarial learning and job shop
scheduling, which allows us to account for distributional shifts in
manufacturing settings with high degrees of product customization. We
empirically validate our proposed approach using real-world data from a job
shop production that supplies large metal components to an oil platform

that our adversarial learning approach outperforms common baselines. Overall,

captured by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to discover a population of

Bang. The authors reported an extraordinarily large density of these galaxies,
with stellar masses exceeding $10^{10}$ solar masses, which, if confirmed,
challenges the standard cosmological model as suggested by recent studies.
However, this conclusion is disputed. We contend that during the early epochs
of the universe the stellar mass-to-light ratio could not have reached the
values reported by Labb\'e et al. A model of galaxy formation based on standard
cosmology provides support for this hypothesis, predicting the formation of
massive galaxies with higher ultraviolet (UV) luminosity, which produce several
hundred solar masses of stars per year and containing significant dust. These
forecasts are consistent with the abundance of JWST/HST galaxies selected
photometrically in the rest-frame UV wavelengths and with the properties of the
recent spectroscopically-confirmed JWST/HST galaxies formed during that era.
Discrepancies with Labb\'e et al. may arise from overestimation of the stellar
masses, systematic uncertainties, absence of JWST/MIRI data, heavy dust
extinction affecting UV luminosities, or misidentification of faint red AGN
galaxies at closer redshifts. The current JWST/HST results, combined with a
realistic galaxy formation model, provide strong confirmation of the standard

waves can be dynamically manipulated by means of artificially engineered planar
materials, composed of sub-wavelength meta-atoms, which are typically referred
to as metasurfaces. Until now, researchers in wireless communications have
mainly focused their attention on space-domain designs of reconfigurable
intelligent surfaces (RISs), where the main concern is to engineer the
spatial-phase gradient across the RIS to decouple incidence and
reflected/refracted directions. However, such designs do not exploit the
temporal dimension. Indeed, additional degrees of freedom for controlling EM
waves can be gained by applying a time modulation to the reflection response of
the metasurface, thereby attaining the so-called space-time RISs. We develop a
general framework where a downlink multiuser transmission over single-input
single-output slow fading channels is assisted by a digitally controlled
space-time RIS. The conclusions of our analysis in terms of system design
guidelines are as follows: (i) if the network utility function is the sum-rate
time-averaged network capacity, without any constraint on fair resource
allocation, and full CSIT is available, then a temporal modulation of the
electronic properties of the RIS is unnecessary; (ii) if partial CSIT is
assumed only, a random modulation in both time and space of the reflection
coefficients of the RIS meta-atoms allows to achieve a suitable balance between
sum-rate time-averaged capacity and user fairness, especially for a
sufficiently large number of users; (iii) regardless of the available amount of
CSIT, the design of temporal variations across the RIS is instrumental for
developing scheduling algorithms aimed at maximizing the network capacity

structure, such as the fluctuation around the axial symmetric shape. Purpose:
The beyond-mean-field effects in neutron-rich nuclei with $N \simeq 28$ are
investigated. We focus on the role of collective mass in triaxial-shape
dynamics. Method: We employ the five-dimensional quadrupole collective
Hamiltonian method with the potential obtained in a constrained
Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov approach with a Skyrme energy-density functional and
the collective-mass functions obtained by the cranking approximation. The
method includes triaxial deformations. Results: We find that $^{42}$Mg,

potential energy surface along the triaxial deformation. Their low-lying
spectra show a strong nucleus dependence, while those obtained with a
collective mass assumed as constant are similar to each other. The energy ratio
$E(0_2^+)/E(2_1^+)$ and the $B(E2)$ ratio $B(E2;0_2^+\to 2_1^+)/B(E2;2_1^+\to

$B(E2)$ ratios in neutron-deficient $\gamma$-soft nuclei with $N=78$ do not
depend on nucleus so much. Conclusions: Low-lying spectra are determined by not
only the potential energy but also the collective mass. We clarify the
important role of the collective mass in low-energy dynamics in the

different orders of spatial differentiation. A detailed mathematical analysis
is presented for the three different cases of either: (i) purely spatial
receptive fields, (ii) space-time separable spatio-temporal receptive fields
and (iii) velocity-adapted spatio-temporal receptive fields. Closed-form
theoretical expressions for the orientation selectivity curves for idealized
models of simple and complex cells are derived for all these main cases, and it
is shown that the degree of orientation selectivity of the receptive fields
increases with a scale parameter ratio $\kappa$, defined as the ratio between
the scale parameters in the directions perpendicular to vs. parallel with the
preferred orientation of the receptive field. It is also shown that the degree
of orientation selectivity increases with the order of spatial differentiation

We conclude by describing biological implications of the derived theoretical
results, demonstrating that the predictions from the presented theory are

sharp orientation tuning of visual neurons in the primary visual cortex, as

dynamics of brain activity from task-dependent fMRI data. Our approach is a
three stage one. First, we exploit Diffusion maps (DMs) to discover a set of
variables that parametrize the low-dimensional manifold on which the emergent
high-dimensional fMRI time series evolve. Then, we construct
reduced-order-models (ROMs) on the embedded manifold via two techniques:
Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) and the Koopman operator. Finally, for
predicting the out-of-sample long-term dynamics of brain activity in the
ambient fMRI space, we solve the pre-image problem coupling DMs with Geometric
Harmonics (GH) when using FNNs and the Koopman modes per se. For our
illustrations, we have assessed the performance of the two proposed schemes
using a benchmark fMRI dataset with recordings during a visuo-motor task. The
results suggest that just a few (for the particular task, five) non-linear
coordinates of the high-dimensional fMRI time series provide a good basis for
modelling and out-of-sample prediction of the brain activity. Furthermore, we
show that the proposed approaches outperform the one-step ahead predictions of
the naive random walk model, which, in contrast to our scheme, relies on the
knowledge of the signals in the previous time step. Importantly, we show that
the proposed Koopman operator approach provides, for any practical purposes,
equivalent results to the FNN-GH approach, thus bypassing the need to train a
non-linear map and to use GH to extrapolate predictions in the ambient fMRI
space; one can use instead the low-frequency truncation of the DMs function
space of L^2-integrable functions, to predict the entire list of coordinate
functions in the fMRI space and to solve the pre-image problem.

Thus, no method exists to adequately derive location data requirements. For

challenging application of automated driving and are employed for tasks such as
detection, semantic segmentation, and sensor fusion. Despite this progress and
tremendous research efforts, several issues still need to be addressed that
limit the applicability of DNNs in automated driving. The bad generalization of
DNNs to new, unseen domains is a major problem on the way to a safe,
large-scale application, because manual annotation of new domains is costly,
particularly for semantic segmentation. For this reason, methods are required
to adapt DNNs to new domains without labeling effort. The task, which these
methods aim to solve is termed unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). While
several different domain shifts can challenge DNNs, the shift between synthetic
and real data is of particular importance for automated driving, as it allows
the use of simulation environments for DNN training. In this work, we present
an overview of the current state of the art in this field of research. We

magnetized flow in the presence of rotation, baroclinicity, shear, or a
combination of them. By including magnetic field in the model we can evaluate
the occurrence of dynamo on both small and large scales. We aim at finding what
are the minimum ingredients needed to trigger a dynamo instability and what is
the relation between dynamo and the growth of vorticity.
  We use the Pencil code to run resistive MHD direct numerical simulations. We
report no dynamo in all cases where only rotation is included, regardless on
the equation of state. Conversely, the inclusion of a background sinusoidal
shearing profile leads to an hydrodynamic instability that produces an
exponential growth of the vorticity at all scales, starting from small ones.
This is know as vorticity dynamo. The onset of this instability occurs after a
rather long temporal evolution of several thousand turbulent turnover times.
The vorticity dynamo in turn drives an exponential growth of the magnetic
field, first at small scales, then also at large one. The instability then
saturates and the magnetic field approximately reaches equipartition with the
turbulent kinetic energy. During the saturation phase we can observe a winding
of the magnetic field in the direction of the shearing flow. By varying the
intensity of the shear we see that the growth rates of this instability change.
The inclusion of the baroclinic term delays the onset of the vorticity dynamo
but leads to a more rapid growth.
  We demonstrate how in the presence of shear, even a purely irrotational
forcing amplifies the field to equipartition. At the same time, we confirm how
this forcing alone does not lead to vorticity nor magnetic field growth, and
this picture does not change in the presence of rotation or baroclinicity up to
$256^3$ meshpoints.

that results in fractional charges to the boundary unit cells. So far,
topological disclination states were observed only in the linear regime, while
the interplay between nonlinearity and topology in the systems with
disclinations has been never studied experimentally. We report here bon the
experimental observation of the nonlinear photonic disclination states in
waveguide arrays with pentagonal or heptagonal disclination cores inscribed in
transparent optical medium using the fs-laser writing technique. The transition
between nontopological and topological phases in such structures is controlled
by the Kekul\'e distortion coefficient $r$ with topological phase hosting
simultaneously disclination states at the inner disclination core and spatially
separated from them corner, zero-energy, and extended edge states at the outer
edge of the structure. We show that the robust nonlinear disclination states
bifurcate from their linear counterparts and that location of their propagation
constants in the gap and, hence, their spatial localization can be controlled
by their power. Nonlinear disclination states can be efficiently excited by
Gaussian input beams, but only if they are focused into the waveguides

temperature and humidity, but also contact aging has been identified as a
primary factor. Several aging mechanisms have been proposed, including
increased ""contact quantity"" due to plastic or elastic creep and enhanced
""contact quality"" due to formation of strong interfacial bonds. While proposed
mechanisms for frictional aging have been dependent upon the presence of a
normal force, this factor is not a fundamental prerequisite for the occurrence
of aging. In light of this, we present a novel demonstration of a substantial
frictional aging effect within a cubic silicon carbide system, even when a
normal force is entirely absent. Our observations indicate that the
time-evolution of the frictional aging effect follows a logarithmic behavior,
which is a pattern that has been previously observed in numerous other
materials. To explain this behavior, we provide a derivation that is rooted in
basic statistical mechanics, demonstrating that surface diffusion, a phenomenon
that serves to minimize surface energy in the interface region, can account for
the observed behavior. Upon application of a normal force, the friction force
is enhanced owing to the presence of plastic creep. Although aging resulting
from plastic and elastic creep is widely recognized and incorporated into most
friction laws, diffusion-driven aging has received comparatively less
attention. The ultimate objective is to develop or redesign friction laws by
incorporating the microscopic behavior, with the potential to enhance their
effectiveness.

  Retrieval","10 pages, accepted at SIGIR 2023",,,,"cs.IR cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies have shown that Dense Retrieval (DR) techniques can
significantly improve the performance of first-stage retrieval in IR systems.
Despite its empirical effectiveness, the application of DR is still limited. In
contrast to statistic retrieval models that rely on highly efficient inverted
index solutions, DR models build dense embeddings that are difficult to be
pre-processed with most existing search indexing systems. To avoid the
expensive cost of brute-force search, the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)
algorithm and corresponding indexes are widely applied to speed up the
inference process of DR models. Unfortunately, while ANN can improve the
efficiency of DR models, it usually comes with a significant price on retrieval
performance.
  To solve this issue, we propose JTR, which stands for Joint optimization of
TRee-based index and query encoding. Specifically, we design a new unified
contrastive learning loss to train tree-based index and query encoder in an
end-to-end manner. The tree-based negative sampling strategy is applied to make
the tree have the maximum heap property, which supports the effectiveness of
beam search well. Moreover, we treat the cluster assignment as an optimization
problem to update the tree-based index that allows overlapped clustering. We
evaluate JTR on numerous popular retrieval benchmarks. Experimental results
show that JTR achieves better retrieval performance while retaining high system
efficiency compared with widely-adopted baselines. It provides a potential
solution to balance efficiency and effectiveness in neural retrieval system
designs.

frustrated classical XY spin model on the kagome lattice, and clarified the
nature of the possible phase transitions of various topological excitations.We
find that the standard tensor network representation for the partition function
does not work due to the strong frustrations in the low temperature limit. To
avoid the direct truncation of the Boltzmann weight, based on the duality
transformation, we introduce a new representation to build the tensor network
with local tensors lying on the centers of the elementary triangles of the
kagome lattice. Then the partition function is expressed as a product of
one-dimensional transfer matrix operators, whose eigen-equation can be solved
by the variational uniform matrix product state algorithm accurately. The
singularity of the entanglement entropy for the one-dimensional quantum
operator provides a stringent criterion for the possible phase transitions.
Through a systematic numerical analysis of thermodynamic properties and
correlation functions in the thermodynamic limit, we prove that the model
exhibits a single Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition only, which
is driven by the unbinding of $1/3$ fractional vortex-antivortex pairs
determined at $T_{c}\simeq 0.075J_{1}$ accurately. The absence of long-range
order of chirality or quasi-long range order of integer vortices has been
verified in the whole finite temperature range. Thus the long-standing
controversy about the phase transitions in this fully frustrated XY model on
the kagome lattice is solved rigorously, which provides a plausible way to
understand the charge-6e superconducting phase observed experimentally in the
two-dimensional kagome superconductors.

spaces and has been widely used in different fields. The non-overlapping SPM,
as one of the data mining techniques, has been used to discover patterns that
have requirements for gap constraints in some specific mining tasks, such as
bio-data mining. And for the non-overlapping sequential patterns with gap
constraints, the Nettree structure has been proposed to efficiently compute the
support of the patterns. For pattern mining, users usually need to consider the
threshold of minimum support (\textit{minsup}). This is especially difficult in
the case of large databases. Although some existing algorithms can mine the
top-$k$ patterns, they are approximate algorithms with fixed lengths. In this
paper, a precise algorithm for mining \underline{T}op-$k$
\underline{N}on-\underline{O}verlapping \underline{S}equential
\underline{P}atterns (TNOSP) is proposed. The top-$k$ solution of SPM is an
effective way to discover the most frequent non-overlapping sequential patterns
without having to set the \textit{minsup}. As a novel pattern mining algorithm,
TNOSP can precisely search the top-$k$ patterns of non-overlapping sequences
with different gap constraints. We further propose a pruning strategy named
\underline{Q}ueue \underline{M}eta \underline{S}et \underline{P}runing (QMSP)
to improve TNOSP's performance. TNOSP can reduce redundancy in non-overlapping
sequential mining and has better performance in mining precise non-overlapping
sequential patterns. The experimental results and comparisons on several
datasets have shown that TNOSP outperformed the existing algorithms in terms of
precision, efficiency, and scalability.

that the NP constants at future $\mathscr{I}^{+}$ and past null infinity
$\mathscr{I}^{-}$ are independent of each other. In other words, the classical
NP constants at $\mathscr{I}^{\pm}$ stem from different parts of the initial

satisfied and give rise to conserved quantities at $\mathscr{I}^{\pm}$ that are
determined by the same piece of initial data which, in turn, correspond to the

$Z\gamma$ final states is presented in this paper. The analysis uses a data
sample of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV proton-proton collisions with an integrated
luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the ATLAS detector during LHC Run 2
operation. The sensitivity of the search is determined using models of the
production and decay of spin-1 charged bosons and spin-0/2 neutral bosons. The
range of resonance masses explored extends from 1.0 TeV to 6.8 TeV. At these
high resonance masses, it is beneficial to target the hadronic decays of the
$W$ and $Z$ bosons because of their large branching fractions. The decay
products of the high-momentum $W/Z$ bosons are strongly collimated and
boosted-boson tagging techniques are employed to improve the sensitivity. No
evidence of a signal above the Standard Model backgrounds is observed, and
upper limits on the production cross-sections of these bosons times their
branching fractions to $W\gamma$ and $Z\gamma$ are derived for various boson
production models.

observational data. The problem becomes more challenging with the presence of
unobserved confounders. When there are unobserved confounders, the commonly
used back-door adjustment is not applicable. Although the instrumental variable
(IV) methods can deal with unobserved confounders, they all assume that the
treatment directly affects the outcome, and there is no mediator between the
treatment and the outcome. This paper aims to use the front-door criterion to
address the challenging problem with the presence of unobserved confounders and
mediators. In practice, it is often difficult to identify the set of variables
used for front-door adjustment from data. By leveraging the ability of deep
generative models in representation learning, we propose FDVAE to learn the
representation of a Front-Door adjustment set with a Variational AutoEncoder,
instead of trying to search for a set of variables for front-door adjustment.
Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of FDVAE
and its superiority over existing methods. The experiments also show that the
performance of FDVAE is not sensitive to the causal strength of unobserved
confounders and is feasible in the case of dimensionality mismatch between
learned representations and the ground truth. We further apply the method to
three real-world datasets to demonstrate its potential applications.

drawbacks. For example, the penetration depth of the ion in the material is
very limited. This is particularly important for energies below MeV, ultimately
reducing the number of available irradiation facilities. In addition to that,
extracting information exclusively from the modified volume may be challenging.
Therefore, extreme caution must be taken when interpreting obtained data. Our
work aims to compare the findings of nanomechanical studies already conducted
separately on thin amorphous ceramic coatings irradiated with ions of different

some instances, the 10% rule may be obeyed. In order to prove our finding, we

this ordering of operations is violated. In this paper, we study a particular
pattern of misuse where an unlock() is issued without first issuing a lock(),
which can happen in code with complex control flow. This misuse is surprisingly
common in several important open-source repositories we study. We
systematically study what happens due to this misuse in several popular locking
algorithms. We study how misuse can be detected and how the locking protocols
can be fixed to avoid the unwanted consequences of misuse. Most locks require
simple changes to detect and prevent this misuse. We evaluate the performance

groups have the potential for UFVNP, with 26 of these symmorphic space groups
belonging to non-polar groups. Notably, the polarization component in UFVNP
materials is quantized. Our theory can explain the experimentally proven
in-plane polarization of the monolayer {\alpha}-In2Se3, which has C3v symmetry.
Additionally, we employ first-principles calculations to demonstrate the
existence of UFVNP in Td phase AgBr, which was not initially anticipated to
exhibit polarization. Thus, UFVNP plays an integral role in characterizing and
exploring the possible applications of ferroelectrics, significantly expanding

attention weights based on the hard alignments obtained from conventional ASR
models, without taking into account the potential loss of ASR accuracy. On the
contrary, here we present a strategy to obtain the alignments as a part of the
model training without external supervision. The alignments produced by the
proposed method are dynamically regularised on the training data, such that the
latency reduction does not result in the loss of ASR accuracy. SR-MLT is
applied as a fine-tuning step on the pre-trained Transformer models that are
based on either monotonic chunkwise attention (MoChA) or cumulative attention
(CA) algorithms for online decoding. ASR experiments on the AIShell-1 and
Librispeech datasets show that when applied on a decent pre-trained MoChA or CA
baseline model, SR-MLT can effectively reduce the latency with the relative
gains ranging from 11.8% to 39.5%. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that under
certain accuracy levels, the models trained with SR-MLT can achieve lower

critical behavior of the bi-dimensional $\pm J$ Ising model, after a quench
from different initial conditions to a critical point $T_c(p)$ on the
paramagnetic-ferromagnetic (PF) transition line, especially, above, below and
at the multicritical Nishimori point (NP). The dynamical critical exponent
$z_c$ seems to exhibit non-universal behavior for quenches above and below the
NP, which is identified as a pre-asymptotic feature due to the repulsive fixed
point at the NP. Whereas, for a quench directly to the NP, the dynamics reaches

geometrical spin clusters (of like spin signs) during the critical dynamics.
Each universality class on the PF line is uniquely characterized by the
stochastic Loewner evolution (SLE) with corresponding parameter $\kappa$.
Moreover, for the critical quenches from the paramagnetic phase, the model,

goals on the branching exponent that is now allowed to vary locally. In
particular, we include variable blood viscosity due to the
F{\aa}hr{\ae}us--Lindqvist effect and enforce an equal pressure drop between
inflow and the micro-circulation. Using our global optimization framework, we
generate vascular trees with over one million terminal vessels and compare them
against a detailed corrosion cast of the portal venous tree of a human liver.
Murray's law is implicitly fulfilled when no additional constraints are
enforced, indicating its validity in this setting. Variable blood viscosity or
equal pressure drop leads to deviations from this optimum, but with the
branching exponent inside the experimentally predicted range between 2.0 and
3.0. The validation against the corrosion cast shows good agreement from the
portal vein down to the venules. Not enforcing Murray's law explicitly reduces
the computational cost and increases the predictive capabilities of synthetic
vascular trees. The ability to study optimal branching exponents across

time-reversal symmetry. We call this noval physics as bilayer stacking
ferrovalley (BSFV). The group theory analysis reveals that the two-dimensional
(2D) valley materials with hexagonal and square lattices can host BSFV. By
searching the 2D material database, we discovered 14 monolayer 2D materials
with direct gaps that are candidates for realizing BSFV. Further
first-principles calculations demonstrate that BSFV exists in RhCl3 and InI
bilayers. The bilayer stacking breaks their three- and four-fold rotation
symmetry, resulting in 39 and 326 meV valley polarization, respectively. More
interestingly, the valley polarization in our systems can be switched by
interlayer sliding. Our study opens up a new direction for designing

  state in black hole binaries","7 pages, 7 figures, submitted to MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fast variability of the X-ray corona in black hole binaries can produce a
soft lag by reverberation, where the reprocessed thermalized disc photons lag
behind the illuminating hard X-rays. This lag is small, and systematically
decreases with increasing mass accretion rate towards the hard-soft transition,
consistent with a decreasing truncation radius between the thin disc and X-ray
hot inner flow. However, the soft lag suddenly increases dramatically just
before the spectrum becomes disc-dominated (hard-intermediate state).
Interpreting this as reverberation requires that the X-ray source distance from
the disc increases dramatically, potentially consistent with switching to
X-rays produced in the radio jet. However, this change in lag behaviour occurs
without any clear change in hard X-ray spectrum, and before the plasmoid
ejection event which might produce such a source (soft-intermediate state).
Instead, we show how the soft lag can be interpreted in the context of
propagation lags from mass accretion rate fluctuations. These normally produce
hard lags, as the model has radial stratification, with fluctuations from
larger radii modulating the harder spectra produced at smaller radii. However,
all that is required to switch the sign is that the hottest Comptonized
emission has seed photons which allow it to extend down in energy below the
softer emission from the slower variable turbulent region from the inner edge
of the disc. Our model connects the timing change to the spectral change, and

paramount, including the formulation of the ABHR. Senior medical students were
invited, and randomly assigned to receive predetermined ABHR volumes (1.5 or
3ml). 340 participants were given equal amounts of gel and liquid on two
separate hand hygiene occasions, which occurred two weeks apart. During the
hand hygiene events, by employing a digital, fully automated system paired with
fluorescent-traced ABHRs, disinfectant hand coverage was objectively
investigated. The 1.5 ml ABHR volume (commonly applied in healthcare settings)
is insufficient in either formulation, as the non-covered areas exceeded
significant (5%+) of the total hand surface area. 3 ml, on the contrary,
resulted in almost complete coverage (uncovered areas remained below 1.5%).
Participants typically underestimated the volume which they needed to apply.
While the liquid ABHR spreads better in the lower, 1.5ml volume compared to the
gel, the latter was easier handled at larger volume. Drying times were 30/32s
(gel and liquid formats, respectively) when 1.5ml handrub was applied, and
40/42s when 3ml was used. As the evaporation rates of the ABHR used in the
study are similar to those available on the market, one can presume that the
results presented in the study apply for most WHO conform ABHRs. The results
show that applying 1.5ml volume was insufficient, as large part of the hand

self-cleaning. Its remarkable properties are the output beam brightness
improvement and robustness to fiber bending and squeezing. These properties
permit to overcome the limitations of multimode fibers in terms of low output
beam quality, which is very promising for a host of technological applications.
In this review, we outline recent progress in the understanding of spatial beam
self-cleaning, which can be seen as a state of thermal equilibrium in the
complex process of modal four-wave mixing. In other words, the associated
nonlinear redistribution of the mode powers which ultimately favors the
fundamental mode of the fiber can be described in the framework of statistical
mechanics applied to the gas of photons populating the fiber modes. On the one

spectrum (PS) in scale-free models (with linear PS $P(k) \propto k^n$) to a
broader class of such models in which part of the matter-like component driving
the Einstein de Sitter expansion does not cluster. These models can be
conveniently parametrized by $\alpha$, the constant logarithmic linear growth
rate of fluctuations (with $\alpha=1$ in the usual case). For $-3< n<-1$, where
the one-loop PS is both infrared and ultraviolet convergent and thus explicitly
self-similar, it is characterized conveniently by a single numerical
coefficient $c(n, \alpha)$. We compare the analytical predictions for $c(n=-2,
\alpha)$ with results from a suite of $N$-body simulations with $\alpha \in
[0.25, 1]$ performed with an appropriately modified version of the Gadget code.
Although the simulations are of small ($256^3$) boxes, the constraint of
self-similarity allows the identification of the converged PS at a level of
accuracy sufficient to test the analytical predictions for the $\alpha$
dependence of the evolved PS. Good agreement for the predicted dependence on
$\alpha$ of the PS is found. To treat the UV sensitivity of results which grows
as one approaches $n =-1$, we derive exact results incorporating a
regularisation $k_c$ and obtain expressions for $c(n, \alpha, k_c/k)$. Assuming
that this regularisation is compatible with self-similarity allows us to infer
a predicted functional form of the PS equivalent to that derived in effective
field theory (EFT). The coefficient of the leading EFT correction at one loop
has a strong dependence on $\alpha$, with a change in sign at $\alpha \approx
0.16$, providing a potentially stringent test of EFT.

chemical process simulation. This work presents a generalization of an approach

equilibria over the whole composition space for a given system with an

discretized and the convex envelope of the Gibbs energy graph is computed.
Employing the tangent plane criterion, all liquid phase equilibria can be

powerful and ubiquitous than ever before. With large neural models and massive
available data, current dialogue systems have access to more knowledge than any
people in their life. However, current dialogue systems still do not perform at
a human level. One major gap between conversational agents and humans lies in
their abilities to be aware of social norms. The development of socially-aware
dialogue systems is impeded due to the lack of resources. In this paper, we
present the first socially-aware dialogue corpus - SocialDial, based on Chinese
social culture. SocialDial consists of two parts: 1,563 multi-turn dialogues
between two human speakers with fine-grained labels, and 4,870 synthetic
conversations generated by ChatGPT. The human corpus covers five categories of
social norms, which have 14 sub-categories in total. Specifically, it contains
social factor annotations including social relation, context, social distance,
and social norms. However, collecting sufficient socially-aware dialogues is
costly. Thus, we harness the power of ChatGPT and devise an ontology-based
synthetic data generation framework. This framework is able to generate
synthetic data at scale. To ensure the quality of synthetic dialogues, we
design several mechanisms for quality control during data collection. Finally,
we evaluate our dataset using several pre-trained models, such as BERT and
RoBERTa. Comprehensive empirical results based on state-of-the-art neural
models demonstrate that modeling of social norms for dialogue systems is a
promising research direction. To the best of our knowledge, SocialDial is the
first socially-aware dialogue dataset that covers multiple social factors and
has fine-grained labels.

Taking advantage of recent advances in X-ray nanotomography, we non-invasively

resolution, revealing a single diamond morphology in a triblock terpolymer
composite network. This morphology, which is ubiquitous in nature, has so far
remained elusive in block copolymers, despite its potential to create materials
with large photonic bandgaps. The discovery was made possible by the precise
analysis of distortions in a large volume of the self-assembled diamond
network, which are difficult to unambiguously assess using traditional

nanotomography, which allows imaging of much larger sample volumes than

dust-free cavities that are reminiscent of transition discs as are commonly
observed around young stars. We aim to assess the size of the inner rim of 6
post-AGB binary systems with lack in the near-IR like this. We used resolved
mid-infrared (mid-IR) high-angular resolution observations of VLTI/MATISSE and
VLTI/MIDI. We compared these inner rim sizes to 5 systems with available
MATISSE data that were identified to host a disc starting at the dust
sublimation radius. We used geometric ring models to estimate the inner rim
sizes, the relative flux contributions of the star, the ring, and an
over-resolved emission, the orientation of the ring, and the spectral
dependences of the components. We find that the inner dust rims of the targets
with a lack of near-IR excess in their SEDs are 2.5 to 7.5 times larger than
the theoretical dust sublimation radii, and inner rim sizes of the systems that
do not show this deficit are similar to those of their theoretical dust
sublimation radii. The physical radii of the inner rims of these transition
discs around post-AGB binaries are 3-25 au, which are larger than the disc
sizes inferred for transition discs around young stars with VLTI/MIDI. With

capabilities of automated vehicles through vehicle-to-everything (V2X)

Nevertheless, obtaining precise positioning information often entails high
costs associated with navigation systems. Moreover, signal drift resulting from
factors such as occlusion and multipath effects can compromise the stability of
the positioning information. Hence, a low-cost and robust method is required to
calibrate relative pose information for multi-agent cooperative perception. In
this paper, we propose a simple but effective inter-agent object association
approach (CBM), which constructs contexts using the detected bounding boxes,
followed by local context matching and global consensus maximization. Based on
the matched correspondences, optimal relative pose transform is estimated,
followed by cooperative perception fusion. Extensive experimental studies are
conducted on both the simulated and real-world datasets, high object
association precision and decimeter level relative pose calibration accuracy is
achieved among the cooperating agents even with larger inter-agent localization
errors. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art

  and Precise Pointer Analysis","Accepted paper at PLDI 2023",,,,"cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Over the past decades, context sensitivity has been considered as one of the
most effective ideas for improving the precision of pointer analysis for Java.
However, despite great precision benefits, as each method is equivalently
cloned and analyzed under each context, context sensitivity brings heavy
efficiency costs. In this work, we present a fundamentally different approach
called Cut-Shortcut for fast and precise pointer analysis for Java. Its insight
is simple: the main effect of cloning methods under different contexts is to
filter spurious object flows that have been merged inside a callee method; from
the view of a typical pointer flow graph (PFG), such effect can be simulated by
cutting off (Cut) the edges that introduce precision loss to certain pointers
and adding Shortcut edges directly from source pointers to the target ones
circumventing the method on PFG. As a result, we can achieve the effect of
context sensitivity without contexts. We identify three general program
patterns and develop algorithms based on them to safely cut off and add
shortcut edges on PFG, formalize them and formally prove the soundness. To
comprehensively validate Cut-Shortcut's effectiveness, we implement two
versions of Cut-Shortcut for two state-of-the-art pointer analysis frameworks
for Java, one in Datalog for the declarative Doop and the other in Java for the
imperative Tai-e, and we consider all the large and complex programs used in
recent literatures that meet the experimental requirements. The evaluation
results are extremely promising: Cut-Shortcut is even able to run faster than
context insensitivity for most evaluated programs while obtaining high
precision that is comparable to context sensitivity (if scalable) in both
frameworks. This is for the first time that we have been able to achieve such a
good efficiency and precision trade-off for those hard-to-analyze programs.

properties. Our main results are as follows: (1) We observe a redshift together
with line centre brightening in the H$\alpha$ line associated with more than
half of the small flares. (2) We employ differential emission measure analysis
using AIA multi-temperature (channel) observations to obtain the emission
measure and temperature of the small flares. The results are consistent with
the Shibata & Yokoyama (1999, 2002) scaling law. From the scaling law, we
estimated the coronal magnetic field strength of small flares to be 5 --15 G.

kinodynamic trajectory to follow the reference path while avoiding perceived

definitive solution is still to be accomplished. In our work, we propose a new
semi-GF coordinated random access (RA) protocol, denoted as partial-information
multiple access (PIMA), to reduce packet loss and latency, particularly in the
presence of sporadic activations. We consider a machine-type communications
(MTC) scenario, wherein devices need to transmit data packets in the uplink to
a base station (BS). When using PIMA, the BS can acquire partial information on
the instantaneous traffic conditions and, using compute-over-the-air
techniques, estimate the number of devices with packets waiting for
transmission in their queue. Based on this knowledge, the BS assigns to each
device a single slot for transmission. However, since each slot may still be
assigned to multiple users, collisions may occur. Both the total number of
allocated slots and the user assignments are optimized, based on the estimated
number of active users, to reduce collisions and improve the efficiency of the
multiple access scheme. To prove the validity of our solution, we compare PIMA

ideal solutions for orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in the time domain in the
case of low and high traffic conditions, respectively. We show that PIMA is

to merge the advantages of both TDMA and SALOHA schemes, thus providing

asymmetry in the QSOs hosts, which is almost twice that of the control

no difference in their Galaxy Zoo classifications. HST images of two highly

the cause of the observed asymmetry in the lower resolution SDSS images. The

yet to be a consensus on how to define and operationalize risk in motion
planning or how to bound or minimize it during operation. In this paper, we
define a stochastic risk measure and introduce it as a constraint into both
robust and stochastic nonlinear model predictive path-following controllers
(RMPC and SMPC respectively). We compare the vehicle's behavior arising from
employing SMPC and RMPC with respect to safety and path-following performance.
Further, the implementation of an automated driving example is provided,
showcasing the effects of different risk tolerances and uncertainty growths in
predictions of other road users for both cases. We find that the RMPC is
significantly more conservative than the SMPC, while also displaying greater
following errors towards references. Further, the RMPCs behavior cannot be
considered as human-like. Moreover, unlike SMPC, the RMPC cannot account for
different risk tolerances. The RMPC generates undesired driving behavior for
even moderate uncertainties, which are handled better by the SMPC.

applications in modern power systems. However, there are usually insufficient
historical load profiles for data analysis, due to the collection cost and data

is an effective technique that provides synthetic training data for customers
to build high-performance data-driven models. Nonetheless, it is still
challenging to synthesize high-quality load profiles for each customer using
generation models trained by the respective customer's data owing to the high
heterogeneity of customer load. In this paper, we propose a novel customized
load profiles synthesis method based on conditional diffusion models for
heterogeneous customers. Specifically, we first convert the customized
synthesis into a conditional data generation issue. We then extend traditional
diffusion models to conditional diffusion models to realize conditional data
generation, which can synthesize exclusive load profiles for each customer
according to the customer's load characteristics and application demands. In
addition, to implement conditional diffusion models, we design a noise
estimation model with stacked residual layers, which improves the generation
performance by using skip connections. The attention mechanism is also utilized
to better extract the complex temporal dependency of load profiles. Finally,
numerical case studies based on a public dataset are conducted to validate the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

learning of recommender systems.
  To tackle the aforementioned problems, we investigate the potential of
jointly incorporating the structural and semantic information within a KG to
model user preferences in finer granularity. A new framework for KG-based
recommender systems, namely \textit{K}nowledge \textit{I}nfomax

KIRS-CL to find the item to recommend via the preference connection between the

distance, a measure derived from the world air transportation network (WAN). It
reduces the complex spreading patterns of a pandemic to a wave-like propagation
from the outbreak country, i.e. a linear relationship to the arrival time of
the unmitigated spread of a disease. However, in the early stage of an
outbreak, what matters to countries' decision makers is knowledge about the
relative risk of arrival of active cases, i.e. how likely it is that an active
case that boarded at the outbreak location will arrive in their country. As
accurate mechanistic models to estimate such risks are still lacking, we
propose here the ``import risk'' model that defines an import probability by
means of the effective-distance framework. The model assumes that airline
passengers are distributed along the shortest path tree that starts at the
outbreak's origin. In combination with a random walk, we account for all
possible paths, thus inferring predominant connecting flights. Our model
outperforms other mobility models, such as the radiation and gravity model with
varying distance types, and it improves further if additional geographic
information is included. The import risk model's precision increases for
countries that are more connected within the WAN, and recovers a geographic
distance-dependence that suggests a pull- rather than a push- dynamic of the

paper addresses the role of ultrasonically induced cavitation bubble clouds in
the stone comminution. The fragmentation of calculi is widely assumed to be due
to the high acoustic wave energy, while the exact contribution of cavitation is
currently unknown. Based on in-situ experimental observations, post-mortem
microtomography and acoustic simulations, the present work provides direct
evidence on the role of cavitation bubbles in the stone surface fragmentation
by correlating the detected damages to the observed bubble activity. Our
results show that not all clouds erode the stone, but only those located in
preferential nucleation sites whose locations are herein examined. In addition,
quantitative characterizations of the bubble clouds and their trajectories
within the ultrasonic field are discussed. These include experiments with and
without the presence of a model stone in the acoustic path length. Finally, the
optimal stone-to-source distance maximizing the cavitation-induced surface
damage area has been determined. Assuming the pressure magnitude within the
focal region to exceed the pressure cavitation threshold, this location does
not correspond to the acoustic focus, where the pressure is maximal, but rather

  a Women's Perspective",,,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: Several researchers report the impact of gender on software
development teams, especially in relation to women. In general, women are
under-represented on these teams and face challenges and difficulties in their
workplaces. When it comes to women who are mothers, these challenges can be
amplified and directly impact these women's professional lives, both in
industry and academia. However, little is known about women ICT practitioners'
perceptions of the challenges of maternity in their professional careers.
Objective: This paper investigates mothers' challenges and difficulties in
global software development teams. Method: We conducted a survey with women ICT
practitioners who work in academia and global technology companies. We surveyed
141 mothers from different countries and employed mixed methods to analyze the
data. Results: Our findings reveal that women face sociocultural challenges,
including work-life balance issues, bad jokes, and moral harassment.
Furthermore, few women occupy leadership positions in software teams, and most
reported that they did not have a support network during and after maternity
leave, feeling overloaded. The surveyed women suggested a set of actions to
reduce the challenges they face in their workplaces, such as: i) changing
culture; ii) creating a code of conduct for men; iii) more empathy; iv)
creating childcare within companies; and v) creating opportunities/programs for
women in the software industry and academia. Conclusion: Adding to the
underrepresentation of ICT roles, women also face many challenges in one
important phase of women's lives, maternity. Our findings explore these
challenges and can help organizations in developing policies to minimize them.
Furthermore, it can help raise awareness of co-workers and bosses, toward a
more friendly and inclusive workplace.

can factor large integers with a certain probability of success in polynomial

circuit depth in the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-scale Quantum) era. To reduce the
resources required for Shor's algorithm, we propose a new distributed
quantum-classical hybrid order-finding algorithm for Shor's algorithm. The
traditional order-finding algorithm needs to obtain an estimation of some
$\dfrac{s}{r}$, where $r$ is the ``order'' and $s\in\{0,1,\cdots,r-1\}$. In our
distributed algorithm, we use $k$ computers to estimate partial bits of
$\dfrac{s}{r}$ separately. In order to reduce the errors of measuring results
of these computers, we use classical programs to correct the measuring results
of each computer to a certain extent. Compared with the traditional Shor's
algorithm, our algorithm reduces nearly $(1-\dfrac{1}{k})L-\log_2k$ qubits for
each computer when factoring an $L$-bit integer. Also, our algorithm reduces
gate complexity and circuit depth to some extent for each computer. The
communication complexity of our algorithm is $O(kL)$.

rheological experiments on thermal greases and observe both stress relaxation

Specifically, we use the models within a data-driven approach based on

problem of determining the rheological model parameters from the dynamic
response in experiments. This training data is generated by startup flow
experiments at different (constant) shear rates using a shear rheometer. We
validate the ``learned'' models by comparing their predicted shear stress
evolution to experiments under shear rates not used in the training data sets.
We further validate the learned TEVP model by solving a forward problem
numerically to determine the shear stress evolution for an input step-strain
profile. Meanwhile, the NEVP model is further validated by comparison to a

modeling approach that gives a different type of claim and may provide a
pathway to overcome this limitation. To this end we used a multiobjective
version of the genetic algorithm (GA): the Multiobjective Evolutionary
Algorithm Based on Decomposition, or MOEA/D. GA strategies explore the
objective function by evolutionary operations to find the different local
minima, and to avoid getting trapped in saddle points. First, we have tested
our algorithm (MOEA/D) using synthetic data based on the 2017 Event Horizon

configuration. We successfully recover a fully evolved Pareto front of
non-dominated solutions for these examples. The Pareto front divides into
clusters of image morphologies representing the full set of locally optimal
solutions. We discuss approaches to find the most natural guess among these
solutions and demonstrate its performance on synthetic data. Finally, we apply
MOEA/D to observations of the black hole shadow in Messier 87 (M87) with the

prediction competition on state-based violence, a novel evaluation score called
targeted absolute deviation with direction augmentation (TADDA) has therefore
been suggested, which accounts for both for the sign and magnitude of
log-changes. While it has a straightforward intuitive motivation, the empirical
results of the challenge show that a no-change model always predicting a
log-change of zero outperforms all submitted forecasting models under the TADDA
score. We provide a statistical explanation for this phenomenon. Analyzing the
properties of TADDA, we find that in order to achieve good scores, forecasters
often have an incentive to predict no or only modest log-changes. In
particular, there is often an incentive to report conservative point
predictions considerably closer to zero than the forecaster's actual predictive
median or mean. In an empirical application, we demonstrate that a no-change

the TADDA score. We conclude by outlining some alternative scoring concepts.

Math. Phys. 328:251-284 (2014)] and new methods [Dupuis, arXiv:2105.05342], we
obtain bounds on the expected deviation from ideal decoupling either in the
one-shot setting in terms of smooth min-entropies, or the finite block length
setting in terms of R\'enyi entropies. These bounds are essentially optimal
without the need to address the simultaneous smoothing conjecture, which
remains unresolved.
  This leads to one-shot, finite block length, and asymptotic achievability
results for several tasks in quantum Shannon theory, including local randomness
extraction of multiple parties, multi-party assisted entanglement
concentration, multi-party quantum state merging, and quantum coding for the
quantum multiple access channel. Because of the one-shot nature of our
protocols, we obtain achievability results without the need for time-sharing,
which at the same time leads to easy proofs of the asymptotic coding theorems.
We show that our one-shot decoupling bounds furthermore yield achievable rates
(so far only conjectured) for multi-user randomness extraction, multipartite
state merging and quantum multiple access channel communication in compound
settings, that is for only partially known i.i.d. source or channel.

Currently, the algorithm offering the best tradeoff between compression rate,

algorithm. However, many studies have pointed out the possibility that the
implementation of lp-norms biases, with p smaller than one, could give better
performance while sacrificing convexity. In this work, we focus specifically on
the extreme case of the l0-based reconstruction, a task that is complicated by
the discontinuity of the loss. In the first part of the paper, we describe via

cannot be recovered accurately. In the second part, we present two

plans for interplanetary human space missions solidify. In the framework of
Bayesian brain theories, gravity encapsulates a strong prior, anchoring agents
to a reference frame via the vestibular system, informing their decisions and
possibly their integration of uncertainty. What happens when such a strong
prior is altered? We address this question using a self-motion estimation task
in a space analog environment under conditions of altered gravity. Two
participants were cast as remote drone operators orbiting Mars in a virtual
reality environment on board a parabolic flight, where both hyper- and
microgravity conditions were induced. From a first-person perspective,
participants viewed a drone exiting a cave and had to first predict a collision
and then provide a confidence estimate of their response. We evoked uncertainty
in the task by manipulating the motion's trajectory angle. Post-decision
subjective confidence reports were negatively predicted by stimulus
uncertainty, as expected. Uncertainty alone did not impact overt behavioral
responses (performance, choice) differentially across gravity conditions.
However microgravity predicted higher subjective confidence, especially in
interaction with stimulus uncertainty. These results suggest that variables
relating to uncertainty affect decision-making distinctly in microgravity,
highlighting the possible need for automatized, compensatory mechanisms when
considering human factors in space research.

interest, our goal is to predict future values of $\mathbf{y}_t$ using
$\mathbf{x}_t$ and lagged values of $\mathbf{y}_t$. The proposed framework
consists of a two-step estimation procedure. First, the Principal Component
Analysis is used to identify all cointegrating vectors of $\mathbf{x}_t$.
Second, the co-integrated stationary series are used as regressors, together
with some lagged variables of $\mathbf{y}_t$, to predict $\mathbf{y}_t$. The
estimated reduced rank is then defined as the effective cointegration rank of
$\mathbf{x}_t$. Under the scenario that the autoregressive coefficient matrices
are sparse (or of low-rank), we apply the Least Absolute Shrinkage and
Selection Operator (or the reduced-rank techniques) to estimate the
autoregressive coefficients when the dimension involved is high. Theoretical
properties of the estimators are established under the assumptions that the

over (an ensemble of) uncertain parameters. Ensemble optimisation (EnOpt)
implements steepest descent by estimating the gradient using linear regression
on Monte-Carlo simulations of (an ensemble of) control parameters. Applying
EnOpt for robust optimisation is costly unless the evaluations over the two
ensembles are combined, i.e. 'paired'. Here, we provide a new and more rigorous
perspective on the stochastic simplex approximate gradient (StoSAG) used in
EnOpt, explaining how it addresses detrimental cross-correlations arising from
pairing by only capturing the variability due to the control vector, and not
the vector of uncertain parameters. A few minor variants are derived from a
generalised derivation, as well as a new approach using decorrelation. These
variants are tested on linear and non-linear toy gradient estimation problems,
where they achieve highly similar accuracy, but require a very large ensemble
size to outperform the non-robust approach when accounting for variance and not
just bias. Other original contributions include a discussion of the particular
robust control objectives for which EnOpt is suited, illustrations, a variance
reduction perspective, and a discussion on the centring in covariance and
gradient estimation.

cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud using observations obtained with the
Hubble Space Telescope in the $V, I$, and $H\alpha$ bands. We identified 250
stars with H$\alpha$ excess exceeding 5 $\sigma$ and an equivalent width of the
H$\alpha$ emission line of at least 20 \r{A}, indicating that these stars are
still undergoing accretion and therefore represent bona fide pre-main-sequence
(PMS) objects. For 240 of these stars, we derived the mass, age, and mass
accretion rate by comparing the observed photometry with theoretical models. We
find evidence for the existence of two populations of PMS stars, with median
ages of 25 and 50 Myr respectively. The average mass accretion rate for these
PMS stars is $\sim 5 \times 10^{-9}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, which is comparable
to the values found in other low-metallicity, low-density clusters in the
Magellanic Clouds, but is about a factor of three lower than those measured for
stars of similar mass and age in denser Magellanic Cloud stellar regions. Our
findings support the hypothesis that both the metallicity and density of the
forming environment can affect the mass accretion rate and thus the star
formation process in a region.
  A study of the spatial distribution of both massive stars and (low-mass) PMS
objects reveals that the former are clustered near the nominal centre of NGC
299, whereas the PMS stars are rather uniformly distributed over the field. To
explore whether the stars formed in an initially more diffuse or compact
structure, we studied the cluster's stellar density profile. We find a core
radius $r_c\simeq 0.6$ pc and a tidal radius $r_t\simeq 5.5$ pc, with an
implied concentration parameter $c \simeq 1$, suggesting that the cluster could
be dispersing into the field.

rotating magnetic fields (RMFs) and the magnetic torques they exert offers the
advantages of efficient mechanical energy transfer and scalable
instrumentation. Nevertheless, closed-loop control still requires a
complementary noninvasive imaging modality to reveal position and trajectory,
such as ultrasound or x-rays, increasing complexity and posing a barrier to
use. Here, we investigate the possibility of combining actuation and sensing
via inductive detection of model microrobots under field magnitudes ranging
from 0.5 mT to 10s of mT rotating at 1 Hz to 100 Hz. A prototype apparatus
accomplishes this using adjustment mechanisms for both phase and amplitude to
finely balance sense and compensation coils, suppressing the background signal
of the driving RMF by 90 dB. Rather than relying on frequency decomposition to
analyze signals, we show that, for rotational actuation, phase decomposition is
more appropriate. We demonstrate inductive detection of a micromagnet placed in
distinct viscous environments using RMFs with fixed and time-varying
frequencies. Finally, we show how magnetostatic gating fields can spatially
isolate inductive signals from a micromagnet actuated by an RMF, with the
resolution set by the relative magnitude of the gating field and the RMF. The
concepts developed here lay a foundation for future closed-loop control schemes
for magnetic microrobots based on simultaneous inductive sensing and actuation.

ensure convergence to the global optimum, but higher levels of such hierarchies
can become very computationally expensive, and the well-known sums of squares
hierarchies scale poorly with the degree of the polynomials. This has motivated
research into alternative certificates and approaches to global optimization.
We consider sums of nonnegative circuit polynomials (SONC) certificates, which
are well-suited for sparse problems since the computational cost depends on the
number of terms in the polynomials and does not depend on the degrees of the
polynomials. We propose a method that guarantees that given finite variable
domains, a SONC relaxation will yield a finite dual bound. This method opens up
a new approach to utilizing variable bounds in SONC-based methods, which is
particularly crucial for integrating SONC relaxations into branch-and-bound
algorithms. We report on computational experiments with incorporating SONC
relaxations into the spatial branch-and-bound algorithm of the mixed-integer

increases the number of instances where the SONC relaxation of the root node

pleasure by searching for the optimal halftone solution, on the contrary,
suffer from their high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a fast and
structure-aware halftoning method via a data-driven approach. Specifically, we
formulate halftoning as a reinforcement learning problem, in which each binary
pixel's value is regarded as an action chosen by a virtual agent with a shared
fully convolutional neural network (CNN) policy. In the offline phase, an
effective gradient estimator is utilized to train the agents in producing
high-quality halftones in one action step. Then, halftones can be generated

Finally, we find that optimizing SSIM could result in holes in flat areas,
which can be avoided by weighting the metric with the contone's contrast map.
Experiments show that our framework can effectively train a light-weight CNN,

AR in photosphere and chromosphere, indicative of flux cancellation favouring
tether-cutting reconnection (TCR), is observed using the magnetic field
observations of HMI/SDO and SOT/Hinode, respectively. The analysis of
spectropolarimetric data obtained by the Interferometric Bidimensional
Spectrometer over the brightening regions suggests untwisting of field lines,
which further supports TCR. Filaments near polarity inversion line region,
resulted from TCR of low lying sheared loops, undergo merging and form an
elongated filament. The temperature and density differences between footpoints
of the merged filament, revealed by DEM analysis, caused streaming and
counter-streaming of plasma flow along the filament and unloads at its
footpoints with an average velocity of $\approx$ 40 km s$^{-1}$. This results
in decrease of mass of the filament (density decreased by $>50\%$), leading to
its rise and expansion outwards. However, due to strong strapping flux, the
filament separates itself instead of erupting. Further, the evolution of
non-potential parameters describes the characteristics of confinedness of the
flare. Our study suggests that the sigmoid-filament system exhibits upward
catastrophe due to mass unloading, but gets suppressed by strong confinement of
external poloidal field.

  stability among convex shapes",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is concerned with stability of the ball for a class of
isoperimetric problems under convexity constraint. Considering the problem of
minimizing $P+\varepsilon R$ among convex subsets of $\mathbb{R}^N$ of fixed
volume, where $P$ is the perimeter functional, $R$ is a perturbative term and
$\varepsilon>0$ is a small parameter, stability of the ball for this perturbed
isoperimetric problem means that the ball is the unique (local, up to
translation) minimizer for any $\varepsilon$ sufficiently small. We investigate
independently two specific cases where $\Omega\mapsto R(\Omega)$ is an energy
arising from PDE theory, namely the capacity and the first Dirichlet eigenvalue
of a domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$. While in both cases stability fails
among all shapes, in the first case we prove (non-sharp) stability of the ball
among convex shapes, by building an appropriate competitor for the capacity of
a perturbation of the ball. In the second case we prove sharp stability of the
ball among convex shapes by providing the optimal range of $\varepsilon$ such
that stability holds, relying on the \emph{selection principle} technique and a
regularity theory under convexity constraint.

categories with few training instances, is an emerging topic in the area of
few-shot learning and object detection. Contemporary techniques can be divided
into two groups: fine-tuning based and meta-learning based approaches. While
meta-learning approaches aim to learn dedicated meta-models for mapping samples
to novel class models, fine-tuning approaches tackle few-shot detection in a
simpler manner, by adapting the detection model to novel classes through
gradient based optimization. Despite their simplicity, fine-tuning based
approaches typically yield competitive detection results. Based on this
observation, we focus on the role of loss functions and augmentations as the
force driving the fine-tuning process, and propose to tune their dynamics
through meta-learning principles. The proposed training scheme, therefore,
allows learning inductive biases that can boost few-shot detection, while
keeping the advantages of fine-tuning based approaches. In addition, the
proposed approach yields interpretable loss functions, as opposed to highly
parametric and complex few-shot meta-models. The experimental results highlight
the merits of the proposed scheme, with significant improvements over the
strong fine-tuning based few-shot detection baselines on benchmark Pascal VOC

ephemeris. We spatially resolve the stellar surface of WASP-131 utilising the
Reloaded Rossiter McLaughlin technique to search for centre-to-limb convective
variations, stellar differential rotation, and to determine the star-planet
obliquity for the first time. We find WASP-131 is misaligned on a nearly
retrograde orbit with a projected obliquity of $\lambda = 162.4\substack{+1.3

shear of $\alpha = 0.61 \pm 0.06$ and disentangled the stellar inclination
($i_* = 40.9\substack{+13.3 \\ -8.5}^{\circ}$) from the projected rotational
velocity, resulting in an equatorial velocity of $v_{\rm{eq}} =

obliquity of $\psi = 123.7\substack{+12.8 \\ -8.0}^{\circ}$, meaning the planet
is on a perpendicular/polar orbit. Therefore, we explored possible mechanisms
for the planetary system's formation and evolution. Finally, we searched for

indicating that centre-to-limb convective variations are not prominent in this

navigate to locations in the scene specified using open-ended vocabulary. We
use this planner to consistently generate trajectories which are both shorter

approaches attempt to minimize error between either the direct (position-based)

from bi-plane image feedback. A comparison between these methods is carried out
on a setup using two cameras in lieu of a bi-plane fluoroscopy setup. The
results show that the position-based approach is less susceptible to
segmentation noise and works best when the segment is in a non-straight

be accompanied with errors under 30 degrees. Considering that the torsional

calibrating quantum optimal controls called Learning Iteratively for Feasible
Tracking (LIFT). LIFT achieves high-fidelity controls despite parasitic model
discrepancies by precisely tracking feasible trajectories of quantum
observables. Feasible trajectories are set by combining black-box optimal
control and the bilinear dynamic mode decomposition, a physics-informed
regression framework for discovering effective Hamiltonian models directly from
rollout data. Any remaining tracking errors are eliminated in a non-causal way
by applying model-based, norm-optimal iterative learning control to subsequent
rollout data. We use numerical experiments of qubit gate synthesis to
demonstrate how LIFT enables calibration of high-fidelity optimal control
waveforms in spite of model discrepancies.

compute an approximate solution or minimum-norm solution to $Ax=b$ or

easy-to-use for practitioners, versatile for a wide range of problems, and
robust in that our implementation does not necessitate any constraints on $A$.
Next, we make computational comparisons of our implementation with the Matlab
implementations of two state-of-the-art algorithms, GMRES and ``lsqminnorm"". We
consider square and rectangular matrices, for $m$ up to $10000$ and $n$ up to
$1000000$, encompassing a variety of applications. These results indicate that
our implementation outperforms GMRES and ``lsqminnorm"" both in runtime and

considerably faster and more consistently than GMRES, and our implementation
provides high precision approximation, faster than GMRES reports lack of
convergence. With respect to ``lsqminnorm"", our implementation runs faster,
producing better solutions. Additionally, we present a theoretical study in the
dynamics of iterations of residuals in CTA and complement it with revealing

the learning that is transferred with an image basis using speckle parameters,
Singular-Value Decomposition Entropy ($H_{SVD}$) and Speckle-Analogue Density

at which a model converges. Similarly, SAD, an averaged spatial frequency,
marks a threshold for structurally similar reconstruction. With a vortex

In this research, we examine the capability of quark stars composed of colour
superconducting quark matter to explain the latter object by using its
marginalised posterior distribution and imposing it as a constraint on the
relevant parameter space. Namely, we investigate quark matter for $N_f=2,3$ in
the colour superconducting phase, incorporating perturbative QCD corrections,
and we derive their properties accordingly. The utilised thermodynamic
potential of this work possesses an MIT bag model formalism with the parameters
being established as flavour-independent. In this instance, we conclude the
favour of 3-flavour over 2-flavour colour superconducting quark matter,
isolating our interest on the former. The parameter space is further confined
due to the additional requirement for a high maximum mass ($M_{\text{TOV}} \geq
2.6 M_{\odot}$), accounting for GW$190814$'s secondary companion. We pay a
significant attention on the speed of sound and the trace anomaly (proposed as

We conclude that it is possible for colour-flavour locked quark stars to reach
high masses without violating the conformal bound or the $\langle \Theta
\rangle _{\mu_B} \geq 0$ if the quartic coefficient value $\alpha_4$ does not

evolving properties of graphs, it is necessary to maintain every change of both
vertices and edges in graph databases with the support of temporal features.
Existing works either maintain all changes in a single graph or periodically
materialize snapshots to maintain the historical states of each vertex and edge
and process queries over proper snapshots. The former approach presents poor
query performance due to the ever-growing graph size as time goes by, while the
latter one suffers from prohibitively high storage overheads due to large
redundant copies of graph data across different snapshots. In this paper, we
propose a hybrid data storage engine, which is based on the MVCC mechanism, to
separately manage current and historical data, which keeps the current graph as
small as possible. In our design, changes in each vertex or edge are stored
once. To further reduce the storage overhead, we simply store the changes as
opposed to storing the complete snapshot. To boost the query performance, we
place a few anchors as snapshots to avoid deep historical version traversals.
Based on the storage engine, a temporal query engine is proposed to reconstruct
subgraphs as needed on the fly. Therefore, our alternative approach can provide
fast querying capabilities over subgraphs at a past time point or range with
small storage overheads. To provide native support of temporal features, we
integrate our approach into Memgraph, and call the extended database system
TGDB(Temporal Graph Database). Extensive experiments are conducted on four real
and synthetic datasets. The results show TGDB performs better in terms of both
storage and performance against state-of-the-art methods and has almost no
performance overheads by introducing the temporal features.

phytoplankton depends upon the optimum concentrations of physiochemical

deviations from an ideal concentration can affect the growth of phytoplankton
which can ultimately disrupt the ecosystem at a large scale. Thus the analysis
of such constituents has high significance to estimate the probable growth of
marine phytoplankton. The advancements of remote sensing technologies have
improved the scope to remotely study the physiochemical constituents on a
global scale. The machine learning techniques have made it possible to predict
the marine chlorophyll levels based on physiochemical properties and deep

quality of the AI-generated content.
  Methods: A large corpus of essays was rated using standard criteria by a
large number of human experts (teachers). We augment the analysis with a

  Results: Our results demonstrate that ChatGPT generates essays that are rated
higher for quality than human-written essays. The writing style of the AI

the number of reported cases) at the moment of decision to change behavior.
However, it is difficult to identify the timing of decision-making. In this
study, we analyzed travel accommodation reservation data in four prefectures of
Japan to observe decision-making timings and how it responded to the changing
epidemic situation during Japan's Coronavirus Disease 2019 (eight waves until
February 2023). To this end, we defined 'mobility avoidance index' to indicate
people's decision of mobility avoidance and quantified it using the time-series
of the accommodation booking/cancellation data. Our analysis revealed
semi-quantitative rules for day-to-day decision-making of human mobility under

and the number of reported cases. Additionally, we found that mobility
avoidance index increased/decreased linearly with the logarithmic number of
reported cases during the first epidemic wave. This pattern agrees with
Weber-Fechner law in psychophysics. We also found that the slope of the
mobility avoidance index against the change of the logarithmic number of
reported cases were similar among the waves, while the intercept of that was
much reduced as the first epidemic wave passed by. It suggests that the

another permanent magnet that rotates in the order of 200 Hz. This surprising
effect can be easily reproduced in the lab with off-the-shelf components. Here
we investigate this novel type of magnetic levitation experimentally and
clarify the underlying physics. Using a 19 mm diameter spherical NdFeB magnet
as rotor magnet, we capture the detailed motion of levitating, spherical NdFeB
magnets, denoted floater magnets, as well as the influence of rotation speed
and magnet size on the levitation. We find that as levitation occurs, the
floater magnet frequency-locks with the rotor magnet, and, noticeably, that the
magnetization of the floater is oriented close to the axis of rotation and
towards the like pole of the rotor magnet. This is in contrast to what might be
expected by the laws of magnetostatics as the floater is observed to align its
magnetization essentially perpendicular to the magnetic field of the rotor.
Moreover, we find that the size of the floater has a clear influence on the
levitation: the smaller the floater, the higher the rotor speed necessary to
achieve levitation, and the further away the levitation point shifts. Despite
the unexpected magnetic configuration during levitation, we verify that
magnetostatic interactions between the rotating magnets are responsible for
creating the equilibrium position of the floater. Hence, this type of magnetic
levitation does not rely on gravity as a balancing force to achieve an
equilibrium position. Based on theoretical arguments and a numerical model, we
show that a constant, vertical field and eddy-current enhanced damping is
sufficient to produce levitation, and to display the same trends with respect
to rotation speed and the floater magnet size as seen in the experiments.

circuits are paramount for a broad class of applications, ranging, e.g., from
telecommunication to photonic computing and quantum technologies. While
grating-based approaches are convenient for out-of-plane access and often
desirable from a packaging point of view, on low-index photonic platforms, such
as silicon nitride or thin-film lithium niobate, the limited grating strength
has thus far hindered the achievement of coupling efficiencies comparable to
the ones attainable in silicon photonics. Here we present a flexible strategy
for the realization of highly efficient grating couplers on low-index photonic
platforms. To simultaneously reach a high scattering efficiency and a
near-unitary modal overlap with optical fibers, we make use of self-imaging
gratings designed with a negative diffraction angle. To ensure high
directionality of the diffracted light, we take advantage of a metal
back-reflector patterned underneath the grating structure by cryogenic deep
reactive ion etching of the silicon handle. Using silicon nitride as a testbed
material, we experimentally demonstrate coupling efficiency up to -0.55 dB in
the telecom C-band with near unity chip-scale device yield.

this method is the realization that it is not only necessary to learn the basic
features that make up a class of signals one wants to represent, but also, or
even more so, which features to avoid in the representation. In this paper, we
will apply this approach to the problem of source separation by means of
non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and present a new method for the
adversarial training of NMF bases. We show in numerical experiments, both for

reconstructed signals, in particular in the case where little or no strong

  fine tuned rainbow gravity","16 pages, 6 Figures",,,,"gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A fine tuned rainbow gravity describes both relativistic quantum particles
and anti-particles alike. That is, the ratio $y=E/E_{P}$ in the rainbow
functions $g_{_{0}}\left( y\right) $ and $% g_{_{1}}\left( y\right) $ should be
fine tuned into $0\leq y=E/E_{P}\leq 1\Rightarrow y=\left\vert E\right\vert
/E_{P}$, otherwise rainbow gravity will only secure Planck's energy scale $E_p$
invariance for relativistic particles and the anti-particles are left
unfortunate (in the sense that their energies will be indefinitely unbounded).
Using this fine tuning we discuss the rainbow gravity effect on Klein-Gordon
(KG) oscillators in Som-Raychaudhuri cosmic string rainbow gravity spacetime
background. We use the rainbow functions: (i) $g_{_{0}}\left( y\right) =1$, $%
g_{_{1}}\left( y\right) =\sqrt{1-\epsilon y^{n}}, n=0,1$, loop quantum gravity
motivated pairs, (ii) $% g_{_{0}}\left( y\right) =g_{_{1}}\left( y\right)
=\left( 1-\epsilon y\right) ^{-1}$, a horizon problem motivated pair, and (iii)
$g_{_{0}}\left( y\right) =\left( e^{\epsilon y}-1\right) /\epsilon y$,
$g_{_{1}}\left( y\right) =1$, a gamma-ray bursts motivated pair. We show that
the energies obtained using the first two rainbow functions in (i) completely
comply with the rainbow gravity model (on the invariance of the Planck's energy
scale $E_{p}$). The rainbow function pair in (ii) has no effect on massless
KG-oscillators. Whereas, the one in (iii) does not show any eminent tendency
towards the invariance of the Planck's energy scale. Yet, we suggest a new
rainbow function pair $(g_0(y)=(1-\epsilon y)^{-1}, g_1 (y)=1)$, and show that
it secures invariance of the Planck's energy scale $E_p$. Moreover, similar
performance is observed when this new pair is used for KG-oscillators and
KG-Coulombic particles in cosmic string rainbow gravity spacetime and magnetic
fields.

a common phenomenon and has been studied by many researchers. The previous
numerical approach has revealed that evaporation accelerates the dewetting
speed of the triple contact line and established correlations between the
dewetting speed and the surface wettability and superheating. However, such a
numerical calculation is time- and resource-consuming. ,We examine dewetting
physics and propose a time-averaged approach based on the multiscale theory.
The new approach averages the dewetting process over time and consists of only
several algebraic equations, making the problem easier to solve. It can produce
time-averaged values of essential quantities, such as the dewetting speed and
contact angle as a function of superheating, which agrees with the previous
numerical results. This simple approach is valuable for many applications, such
as modeling pulsating heat pipes and describing the microlayer dynamics under
growing vapor bubbles in nucleate boiling.

  dependencies from EEG signals","7 pages, 7 figures",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are resultants of extremely complex
brain activity. Some details of this hidden dynamics might be accessible
through e.g. joint distributions $\rho_{\Delta t}$ of signals of pairs of
electrodes shifted by various time delays (lag $\Delta t$). A standard approach
is monitoring a single evaluation of such joint distributions, like Pearson
correlation (or mutual information), which turns out relatively uninteresting -
as expected, there is usually a small peak for zero delay and nearly symmetric
drop with delay. In contrast, such a complex signal might be composed of
multiple types of statistical dependencies - this article proposes approach to
automatically decompose and extract them. Specifically, we model such joint
distributions as polynomials, estimated separately for all considered lag
dependencies, then with PCA dimensionality reduction we find the dominant joint
density distortion directions $f_v$. This way we get a few lag dependent
features $a_i(\Delta t)$ describing separate dominating statistical
dependencies of known contributions: $\rho_{\Delta t}(y,z)\approx \sum_{i=1}^r
a_i(\Delta t)\, f_{v_i}(y,z)$. Such features complement Pearson correlation,
extracting hidden more complex behavior, e.g. with asymmetry which might be
related with direction of information transfer, extrema suggesting
characteristic delays, or oscillatory behavior suggesting some periodicity.
There is also discussed extension of Granger causality to such multi-feature
joint density analysis, suggesting e.g. two separate causality waves. While
this early article is initial fundamental research, in future it might help
e.g. with understanding of cortex hidden dynamics, diagnosis of pathologies
like epilepsy, determination of precise electrode position, or building
brain-computer interface.

  on Machine Learning and Touch Dynamics",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The aim of this research paper is to look into the use of continuous
authentication with mobile touch dynamics, using three different algorithms:
Neural Network, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machine. Mobile
devices are constantly increasing in popularity in the world, today smartphone
subscriptions have surpassed 6 billion. Mobile touch dynamics refer to the
distinct patterns of how a user interacts with their mobile device, this
includes factors such as touch pressure, swipe speed, and touch duration.
Continuous authentication refers to the process of continuously verifying a
user's identity while they are using a device, rather than just at the initial
login. This research used a dataset of touch dynamics collected from 40
subjects using the LG V30+. The participants played four mobile games, PUBG,
Diep.io, Slither, and Minecraft, for 10 minutes each game. The three algorithms
were trained and tested on the extracted dataset, and their performance was
evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, false negative rate,
and false positive rate. The results of the research showed that all three
algorithms were able to effectively classify users based on their individual
touch dynamics, with accuracy ranging from 80% to 95%. The Neural Network
algorithm performed the best, achieving the highest accuracy and precision
scores, followed closely by XGBoost and SVC. The data shows that continuous
authentication using mobile touch dynamics has the potential to be a useful
method for enhancing security and reducing the risk of unauthorized access to
personal devices. This research also notes the importance of choosing the
correct algorithm for a given dataset and use case, as different algorithms may
have varying levels of performance depending on the specific task.

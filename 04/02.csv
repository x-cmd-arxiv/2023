them to successfully complete their tasks. But what are the real outcomes when
this trust is violated? Self-defense law provides a framework for analyzing
tangible failure scenarios that can inform the design of robots and their
algorithms. Studying self-defense is particularly important for ground robots
since they operate within public human environments, where they can pose a
legitimate threat to human safety. Moreover, even if ground robots can
guarantee human safety, the perception of a threat is enough to warrant human
self-defense against robots. In this paper, we synthesize works in law,
engineering, and the social sciences to present four actionable recommendations
for how the robotics community can craft robots to mitigate the likelihood of
self-defense situations arising. We establish how current U.S. self-defense law
can justify a human protecting themselves against a robot, discuss the current
literature on human attitudes toward robots, and analyze methods that have been
produced to allow robots to operate close to humans. Finally, we present
hypothetical scenarios that underscore how current robot navigation methods can
fail to sufficiently consider self-defense concerns and the need for the
recommendations to guide improvements in the field.

fluence of 4 Joule/cm$^2$ produces the highest magnetization of ~547 emu/cc.
The small coercivity (few Oersted) and sharp ferromagnetic switching behaviour

the parametric SMPL-X model, can take an arbitrary number of input images to

our framework is our novel self-evolved signed distance field (SeSDF) module

derived from the fitted SMPL-X model, such that detailed geometry reflecting
the actual clothed human can be encoded for better reconstruction. Besides, we
propose a simple method for self-calibration of multi-view images via the
fitted SMPL-X parameters. This lifts the requirement of tedious manual
calibration and largely increases the flexibility of our method. Further, we
introduce an effective occlusion-aware feature fusion strategy to account for
the most useful features to reconstruct the human model. We thoroughly evaluate
our framework on public benchmarks, demonstrating significant superiority over
the state-of-the-arts both qualitatively and quantitatively.

scattering, mass and density of amorphous silica NPs during pumping process. we
propose that the loss of NPs may arises from the motional instability induced
by laser heating lead releasing at low pressure. In this work, two types of NPs
are heat treated from 100 to 1200 degree Celsius to release impurities before
being loaded into an optical trap. The high vacuum levitation ratio for both
NPs increase obviously after heat treatment. In particular, for NPs heated to
600 degree Celsius, the ratio strikingly improves from ~30% to 100% and ~0 to
85% for two types of NPs. The loss mechanism is further confirmed by their
relatively stable physicochemical parameters during pumping process. This work
paves a way for wide application of levitated nano-resonators and indicates
that levitated vacuum optomechanical systems could be a promising tool for

eliminate market risk, it is still a great challenge for reinforcement learning
(RL) methods to perform pair trading as human expertise. It requires RL methods
to make thousands of correct actions that nevertheless have no obvious
relations to the overall trading profit, and to reason over infinite states of
the time-varying market most of which have never appeared in history. However,
existing RL methods ignore the temporal connections between asset price
movements and the risk of the performed trading. These lead to frequent
tradings with high transaction costs and potential losses, which barely reach
the human expertise level of trading. Therefore, we introduce CREDIT, a
risk-aware agent capable of learning to exploit long-term trading opportunities
in pair trading similar to a human expert. CREDIT is the first to apply
bidirectional GRU along with the temporal attention mechanism to fully consider
the temporal correlations embedded in the states, which allows CREDIT to
capture long-term patterns of the price movements of two assets to earn higher
profit. We also design the risk-aware reward inspired by the economic theory,
that models both the profit and risk of the tradings during the trading period.
It helps our agent to master pair trading with a robust trading preference that
avoids risky trading with possible high returns and losses. Experiments show
that it outperforms existing reinforcement learning methods in pair trading and
achieves a significant profit over five years of U.S. stock data.

safety critical systems such as autonomous vehicles. Failure search may be done
through logging substantial vehicle miles in either simulation or real world
testing. Due to the sparsity of failure events, naive random search approaches
require significant amounts of vehicle operation hours to find potential system
weaknesses. As a result, adaptive searching techniques have been proposed to
efficiently explore and uncover failure trajectories of an autonomous policy in
simulation. Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) is one such method that poses the
problem of failure search as a Markov decision process and uses reinforcement
learning techniques to find high probability failures. However, this
formulation requires a probability model for the actions of all agents in the
environment. In systems where the environment actions are discrete and
dependencies among agents exist, it may be infeasible to fully characterize the
distribution or find a suitable proxy. This work proposes the use of a data
driven approach to learn a suitable classifier that tries to model how humans
identify {critical states and use this to guide failure search in AST. We show
that the incorporation of critical states into the AST framework generates
failure scenarios with increased safety violations in an autonomous driving

learning-based autonomous agents, it becomes more challenging for human
observers to efficiently construct a mental model of the agent's behaviour. In
order to successfully deploy autonomous agents, humans should not only be able
to understand the individual limitations of the agents but also have insight on
how they compare against one another. To do so, we need effective methods for
generating human interpretable agent behaviour summaries. Single agent
behaviour summarization has been tackled in the past through methods that
generate explanations for why an agent chose to pick a particular action at a
single timestep. However, for complex tasks, a per-action explanation may not
be able to convey an agents global strategy. As a result, researchers have
looked towards multi-timestep summaries which can better help humans assess an
agents overall capability. More recently, multi-step summaries have also been
used for generating contrasting examples to evaluate multiple agents. However,
past approaches have largely relied on unstructured search methods to generate
summaries and require agents to have a discrete action space. In this paper we
present an adaptive search method for efficiently generating contrasting
behaviour summaries with support for continuous state and action spaces. We
perform a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of the summaries for helping
humans discern the superior autonomous agent for a given task. Our results
indicate that adaptive search can efficiently identify informative contrasting
scenarios that enable humans to accurately select the better performing agent

provided that the measurement is performed in the back-scattering regime.
Coherent states are not capable of reaching this optimal resolution (or do so
with negligible visibility). Using two-photon states improves upon the
one-photon resolution, but the improvement (at $100\%$ visibility) is smaller
than twice, and it demands prior information on the object. This improvement
can also be realized via two independent laser fields. The dependence on the
prior information can be decreased (but not eliminated completely) upon using
entangled states of two photons.

of moving loads using physics-informed machine learning (PIML).
Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) utilize the underlying physics of
moving load problems and aim to predict the deflection of beams and the
magnitude of the loads. The mathematical representation of the moving load
considered in this work involves a Dirac delta function, to capture the effect
of the load moving across the structure. Approximating the Dirac delta function
with PINNs is challenging because of its instantaneous change of output at a
single point, causing difficulty in the convergence of the loss function. We
propose to approximate the Dirac delta function with a Gaussian function. The
incorporated Gaussian function physical equations are used in the
physics-informed neural architecture to simulate beam deflections and to
predict the magnitude of the load. Numerical results show that PIML is an
effective method for simulating the forward and inverse problems for the
considered model of a moving load.

control constraints can be reduced to a sequence of Quadratic Programs (QPs)
using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). One of the main challenges in this
method is that the CBF-based QP could easily become infeasible under tight
control bounds, especially when the control bounds are time-varying. The
recently proposed adaptive CBFs have addressed such infeasibility issues, but
require extensive and non-trivial hyperparameter tuning for the CBF-based QP
and may introduce overshooting control near the boundaries of safe sets. To
address these issues, we propose a new type of adaptive CBFs called Auxiliary
Variable CBFs (AVCBFs). Specifically, we introduce an auxiliary variable that
multiplies each CBF itself, and define dynamics for the auxiliary variable to
adapt it in constructing the corresponding CBF constraint. In this way, we can
improve the feasibility of the CBF-based QP while avoiding extensive parameter
tuning with non-overshooting control since the formulation is identical to
classical CBF methods. We demonstrate the advantages of using AVCBFs and
compare them with existing techniques on an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)

tests, we combine the incorrect patches with their corresponding relevant test
failure information to construct a new prompt for the LLM to generate the next
patch. In this way, we can avoid making the same mistakes. For earlier patches
that passed all the tests, we further ask the LLM to generate alternative
variations of the original plausible patches. In this way, we can further build
on and learn from earlier successes to generate more plausible patches to

nonlinear photophysical dynamics in two distinct semiconductor classes through
time-integrated photoluminescence and photocurrent measurements. In this
experiment, two variably delayed femtosecond pulses excite the semiconductor,
and the time-integrated photoluminescence or photocurrent component arising
from the nonlinear dynamics of the populations induced by each pulse is
measured as a function of inter-pulse delay by phase-sensitive detection with a
lock-in amplifier. We focus on two limiting materials systems with contrasting
optical properties: a prototypical lead-halide perovskite (LHP) solar cell, in
which primary photoexcitations are charge photocarriers, and a single-component
organic-semiconductor diode, which features Frenkel excitons as primary
photoexcitations. The photoexcitation dynamics perceived by the two detection
schemes in these contrasting systems are distinct. Nonlinear-dynamic
contributions in the photoluminescence detection scheme arise from
contributions to radiative recombination in both materials systems, while
photocurrent arises directly in the LHP but indirectly following exciton
dissociation in the organic system. Consequently, the basic photophysics of the
two systems are reflected differently when comparing measurements with the two
detection schemes.

on what output model is considered. We study a variety of output models,
ranging from the open model, in which an external observer can compute the
outcome, to the XOR model, in which the outcome of the protocol should be the
bitwise XOR of the players' local outputs. This model is inspired by XOR games,
which are widely studied two-player quantum games. We focus on the question of
error-reduction in these new output models. For functions of output size k,
applying standard error reduction techniques in the XOR model would introduce
an additional cost linear in k. We show that no dependency on k is necessary.
Similarly, standard randomness removal techniques, incur a multiplicative cost
of $2^k$ in the XOR model. We show how to reduce this factor to O(k). In
addition, we prove analogous error reduction and randomness removal results in
the other models, separate all models from each other, and show that some
natural problems, including Set Intersection and Find the First Difference,
separate the models when the Hamming weights of their inputs is bounded.
Finally, we show how to use the rank lower bound technique for our weak output
models.

existing methods for the error analysis of particle filters and stability
results for optimal transport map estimation are combined to obtain uniform
error bounds for the filter's performance in terms of the optimization gap in
solving the variational problem. The error analysis reveals a bias-variance
trade-off that can ultimately be used to understand if/when the curse of

proposed algorithm is evaluated on a nonlinear filtering example in comparison
with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and the sequential importance resampling

an important role when applying our theoretical results to other frameworks. We
introduce a formulation of the similarity structure of learned representations

been increasingly employed in high-impact areas such as system security,
banking, and health care. A big threat to the serverless cloud's performance is
cold-start, which is when the time of provisioning the needed cloud resource to
serve customers' requests incurs unacceptable costs to the service providers

ensemble policy that addresses the cold-start problem at infrastructure- and
function-levels of the serverless cloud stack, while the state of the art

we present an approach to learn an approximate information state model of

our approach, the CAV learns the behavior of an incoming HDV using approximate
information states before generating a control strategy to facilitate merging.
First, we validate the efficacy of this framework on real-world data by using
it to predict the behavior of an HDV in mixed traffic situations extracted from
the Next-Generation Simulation repository. Then, we generate simulation data
for HDV-CAV interactions in a highway merging scenario using a standard inverse
reinforcement learning approach. Without assuming a prior knowledge of the
generating model, we show that our approximate information state model learns
to predict the future trajectory of the HDV using only observations.
Subsequently, we generate safe control policies for a CAV while merging with
HDVs, demonstrating a spectrum of driving behaviors, from aggressive to
conservative. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by
performing numerical simulations.

rotations of chemical controls) 3. partition chemistry (modes of action through
space and time, which in effect is a refuge management strategy) and 4. include

drugs, and thus should be employed to improve oncology. We review the parallel
difficulties in controlling the evolution of drug resistance in pests and

examines an experiment designed to identify the causal effect of scaling up
incentives on choices and beliefs in strategic settings by holding fixed
opponents' actions. In dominance-solvable games, higher incentives increase
action sophistication and best-response rates and decrease mistake propensity.
Beliefs tend to become more accurate with higher own incentives in simple
games. However, opponents with higher incentive levels are harder to predict:
while beliefs track opponents' behavior when they have higher incentive levels,
beliefs about opponents also become more biased. We provide evidence that
incentives affect cognitive effort and that greater effort increases
performance and predicts choice and belief sophistication. Overall, the data
lends support to combining both payoff-dependent mistakes and costly reasoning.

This new scheme allows flexible both global and local interactions between the

one source domain to perform well on arbitrary unseen target domains. Image
augmentation based on Random Convolutions (RandConv), consisting of one
convolution layer randomly initialized for each mini-batch, enables the model
to learn generalizable visual representations by distorting local textures
despite its simple and lightweight structure. However, RandConv has structural
limitations in that the generated image easily loses semantics as the kernel
size increases, and lacks the inherent diversity of a single convolution
operation. To solve the problem, we propose a Progressive Random Convolution
(Pro-RandConv) method that recursively stacks random convolution layers with a
small kernel size instead of increasing the kernel size. This progressive
approach can not only mitigate semantic distortions by reducing the influence
of pixels away from the center in the theoretical receptive field, but also
create more effective virtual domains by gradually increasing the style
diversity. In addition, we develop a basic random convolution layer into a
random convolution block including deformable offsets and affine transformation
to support texture and contrast diversification, both of which are also
randomly initialized. Without complex generators or adversarial learning, we
demonstrate that our simple yet effective augmentation strategy outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on single domain generalization benchmarks.

classes continually from limited samples without forgetting the old classes.
The mainstream framework tackling FSCIL is first to adopt the cross-entropy
(CE) loss for training at the base session, then freeze the feature extractor
to adapt to new classes. However, in this work, we find that the CE loss is not
ideal for the base session training as it suffers poor class separation in
terms of representations, which further degrades generalization to novel
classes. One tempting method to mitigate this problem is to apply an additional
naive supervised contrastive learning (SCL) in the base session. Unfortunately,
we find that although SCL can create a slightly better representation
separation among different base classes, it still struggles to separate base
classes and new classes. Inspired by the observations made, we propose
Semantic-Aware Virtual Contrastive model (SAVC), a novel method that
facilitates separation between new classes and base classes by introducing
virtual classes to SCL. These virtual classes, which are generated via
pre-defined transformations, not only act as placeholders for unseen classes in
the representation space, but also provide diverse semantic information. By
learning to recognize and contrast in the fantasy space fostered by virtual
classes, our SAVC significantly boosts base class separation and novel class
generalization, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on the three

  Generative Adversarial Networks","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging",,,,"eess.SP cs.CV cs.LG stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Medical imaging systems are often evaluated and optimized via objective, or
task-specific, measures of image quality (IQ) that quantify the performance of
an observer on a specific clinically-relevant task. The performance of the
Bayesian Ideal Observer (IO) sets an upper limit among all observers, numerical
or human, and has been advocated for use as a figure-of-merit (FOM) for
evaluating and optimizing medical imaging systems. However, the IO test
statistic corresponds to the likelihood ratio that is intractable to compute in
the majority of cases. A sampling-based method that employs Markov-Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) techniques was previously proposed to estimate the IO performance.
However, current applications of MCMC methods for IO approximation have been
limited to a small number of situations where the considered distribution of
to-be-imaged objects can be described by a relatively simple stochastic object
model (SOM). As such, there remains an important need to extend the domain of
applicability of MCMC methods to address a large variety of scenarios where
IO-based assessments are needed but the associated SOMs have not been
available. In this study, a novel MCMC method that employs a generative
adversarial network (GAN)-based SOM, referred to as MCMC-GAN, is described and
evaluated. The MCMC-GAN method was quantitatively validated by use of
test-cases for which reference solutions were available. The results
demonstrate that the MCMC-GAN method can extend the domain of applicability of
MCMC methods for conducting IO analyses of medical imaging systems.

the multiplicity dependence of $\Lambda_{c}^{+}/D^{0}$ ratio as the function of

from a pretrained large-scale model like visual question answering (VQA) to the
target model. To mitigate the effects of a Trojan attack, replacing and
fine-tuning multiple layers of the pretrained model is possible. This research
focuses on sample efficiency, stealthiness and variation, and robustness to

Trojan attack that generates diverse Trojans across input samples and
modalities. Adversarial learning establishes a correlation between a specified
perturbation layer and the misbehavior of the fine-tuned model. We conducted
extensive experiments on the VQA-v2 dataset using a range of metrics. The
results show that our proposed method can effectively adapt to a fine-tuned

estimation methods for wideband MIMO mmWave systems with the aid of extremely
large-scale reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (XL-RIS). For the wideband
signals reflected by the analog RIS, we characterize their near-field beam
squint effect in both angle and distance domains. Based on the mathematical
analysis of the near-field beam patterns over all frequencies, a wideband
spherical-domain dictionary is constructed by minimizing the coherence of two
arbitrary beams. In light of this, we formulate a two-dimensional compressive
sensing problem to recover the channel parameter based on the spherical-domain
sparsity of mmWave channels. To this end, we present a correlation

scientific and application areas. Many modern datasets exhibit dependencies
among observations as well as variables. This gives rise to the challenging
problem of analyzing high-dimensional matrix-variate data with unknown
dependence structures. To address this challenge, Kalaitzis et. al. (2013)
proposed the Bigraphical Lasso (BiGLasso), an estimator for precision matrices
of matrix-normals based on the Cartesian product of graphs. Subsequently,
Greenewald, Zhou and Hero (GZH 2019) introduced a multiway tensor
generalization of the BiGLasso estimator, known as the TeraLasso estimator. In
this paper, we provide sharp rates of convergence in the Frobenius and operator
norm for both BiGLasso and TeraLasso estimators for estimating inverse
covariance matrices. This improves upon the rates presented in GZH 2019. In
particular, (a) we strengthen the bounds for the relative errors in the
operator and Frobenius norm by a factor of approximately $\log p$; (b)
Crucially, this improvement allows for finite-sample estimation errors in both
norms to be derived for the two-way Kronecker sum model. This closes the gap
between the low single-sample error for the two-way model empirically observed
in GZH 2019 and the theoretical bounds therein. The two-way regime is
particularly significant since it is the setting of common and generic
applications in practice. Normality is not needed in our proofs; instead, we
consider subgaussian ensembles and derive tight concentration of measure
bounds, using tensor unfolding techniques. The proof techniques may be of
independent interest to the analysis of tensor-valued data.

dedicated dust detectors by registering transient voltage perturbations caused
by impact-generated plasma. The signal waveform contains information about the
interaction between the impact-generated plasma cloud and the elements of
SC-antenna system. The variability of antenna signals from dust impacts has not
yet been systematically characterized. A set of laboratory measurements are
performed to characterize signal variations in response to SC parameters (bias
voltage and antenna configuration) and impactor parameters (impact speed and
composition). The measurements demonstrate that dipole antenna configurations
are sensitive to dust impacts and that the detected signals vary with impact
location. When dust impacts occur at low speeds, the antennas typically
register smaller amplitudes and less characteristic impact signal shapes. In
this case, impact event identification may be more challenging due to lower
signal-to-noise ratios and/or more variable waveforms shapes, indicating the
compound nature of nonfully developed impact-generated plasmas. To investigate
possible variations in the impacting materials, the measurements are carried
out using two dust samples with different mass densities: iron and aluminum. No
significant variations of the measured waveform or plasma parameters obtained
from data analysis are observed between the two materials used.

due to their properties which can be tailored by tuning their dimensions.
Herein, we demonstrate the growth of highly crystalline quasi-one-dimensional
(1D)MoS$_2$ nanoribbons and aligned 3D triangular crystals with predominantly
3R or 2H stacking orientation. The synthesis method relies on the reaction
between an ultra-thin MoO3-x film grown by Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) and
NaF in a sulfur-rich environment. The quasi-1D MoS$_2$ nanoribbons can reach
several micrometres in length, and feature single-layer (1L) edges aligned with
the nanoribbon core, thereby forming a 1L-multilayer (ML) homojunction due to
abrupt discontinuity in thickness. The 1L edges of the nanostructures show a
pronounced second harmonic generation (SHG) due to the symmetry breaking, in
contrast to the centrosymmetric ML structure, which is unsusceptible to the
second-order nonlinear process. A pronounced splitting of the Raman spectra was
observed in quasi-1D MoS$_2$ nanoribbons arising from distinct contributions
from the 2D edges and a multilayer core. Nanoscale imaging reveals the
blue-shifted exciton emission of the monolayer nanoribbon compared to the
triangular MoS$_2$ counterpart due to built-in local strain and disorder. We
further report on a versatile and ultrasensitive photodetector made of a single
quasi-1D MoS$_2$ nanoribbon with a maximum responsivity of 872 A/W at the
wavelength of 532 nm. The optoelectronic performance of the MoS$_2$ nanoribbon
is superior to the previously reported single-nanoribbon photodetectors. Our
findings can inspire the design of TMD semiconductors with tunable geometries
for efficient optoelectronic devices.

mid-rise residential buildings in Canada. This study employed EnergyPlus to
examine the energy performance of 11 energy retrofit measures for a typical
multi-unit residential building (MURB) in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia,
Canada. The author employed the energy simulation software (EnergyPlus) to
evaluate the pre-and post-retrofit operational energy performance of the
selected MURB. Two base building models powered by natural gas (NG-building)
and electricity (E-building) were created by SketchUP. The energy simulation
results were combined with cost and emission impact data to evaluate the
economic and environmental performance of the selected energy retrofit
measures. The results indicated that the NG-building can produce significant
GHG emission reductions (from 27.64 tCO2e to 3.77 tCO2e) by implementing these
energy retrofit measures. In terms of energy savings, solar PV, ASHP, water
heater HP, and HRV enhancement have great energy saving potential compared to
other energy retrofit measures. In addition, temperature setback, lighting, and
airtightness enhancement present the best economic performance from a life
cycle perspective. However, windows, ASHP, and solar PV, are not economical
choices because of higher life cycle costs. While ASHP can increase life cycle
costs for the NG-building, with the financial incentives provided by the
governments, ASHP could be the best choice to reduce GHG emissions when
stakeholders make decisions on implementing energy retrofits.

are prone to hallucinations, where the model exposes incorrect or false

mandatory. While LLM performance in specific knowledge fields is often
evaluated based on question and answer (Q&A) datasets, such evaluations usually
report only a single accuracy number for the entire field, a procedure which is
problematic with respect to transparency and model improvement. A stratified
evaluation could instead reveal subfields, where hallucinations are more likely
to occur and thus help to better assess LLMs' risks and guide their further
development. To support such stratified evaluations, we propose LLMMaps as a
novel visualization technique that enables users to evaluate LLMs' performance
with respect to Q&A datasets. LLMMaps provide detailed insights into LLMs'
knowledge capabilities in different subfields, by transforming Q&A datasets as
well as LLM responses into our internal knowledge structure. An extension for
comparative visualization furthermore, allows for the detailed comparison of
multiple LLMs. To assess LLMMaps we use them to conduct a comparative analysis
of several state-of-the-art LLMs, such as BLOOM, GPT-2, GPT-3, ChatGPT and
LLaMa-13B, as well as two qualitative user evaluations. All necessary source

investigations are both of an algebraic and a geometric nature. Indeed, it is
the combination of the two that gives this paper its overall character. The
work is in four parts. Chapter 1 is a brisk tour of necessary basics;
definitions, key theorems, and a number of techniques subsequently used
extensively. A simple one dimensional drawing rule is investigated in chapter 2
with the aid of what is thought to be an original geometric figure that we will
call a ""deviation from zero diagram"". A highlight of the chapter is its
concluding elementary proof of a non-trivial result. Chapter 3 presents a two
dimensional drawing rule. Although selected because it is amongst the simplest
form possible, this time the object derived from the rule is a fractal. That
this is so is proven and its fractal (Hausdorff) dimension calculated. This
fractal is a (possibly previously unexplored) variant of that known in the
literature as ""The Fibonacci Fractal"". By way of an overall conclusion, the
last chapter, the fourth, suggests a few aspects of those preceding it worthy

they can interpolate the training data. Under such a scenario, we study the
convergence properties of a sampling-without-replacement variant of stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) known as random reshuffling (RR). Unlike SGD that
samples data with replacement at every iteration, RR chooses a random
permutation of data at the beginning of each epoch and each iteration chooses
the next sample from the permutation. For under-parameterized models, it has
been shown RR can converge faster than SGD under certain assumptions. However,
previous works do not show that RR outperforms SGD in over-parameterized
settings except in some highly-restrictive scenarios. For the class of
Polyak-\L ojasiewicz (PL) functions, we show that RR can outperform SGD in
over-parameterized settings when either one of the following holds: (i) the
number of samples ($n$) is less than the product of the condition number
($\kappa$) and the parameter ($\alpha$) of a weak growth condition (WGC), or

\citet{Wilson2021} as evidence for temporal atmospheric variation. We perform a

fast sounds in molecular liquids being larger than about 15-20% of typical
liquid metals are interpreted as extra energy-losses for terahertz phonons by
vibrational and rotational motions of molecules. The rates of the fast and slow

about 0.5 and 2 ps, which correspond to the vibrational and rotational motions

discussed in terms of lifetime and propagating length of the terahertz phonon
oscillations. The microscopic kinematic longitudinal viscosity rapidly

annotations as ground truth to mitigate the bias caused by individual

effective because new biases might be produced during the process, especially
when there are significant variations among annotations. This paper proposes a
novel Uncertainty-guided Multi-source Annotation Network (UMA-Net) to learn
medical image segmentation directly from multiple annotations. UMA-Net consists
of a UNet with two quality-specific predictors, an Annotation Uncertainty
Estimation Module (AUEM) and a Quality Assessment Module (QAM). Specifically,
AUEM estimates pixel-wise uncertainty maps of each annotation and encourages
them to reach an agreement on reliable pixels/voxels. The uncertainty maps then
guide the UNet to learn from the reliable pixels/voxels by weighting the
segmentation loss. QAM grades the uncertainty maps into high-quality or
low-quality groups based on assessment scores. The UNet is further implemented
to contain a high-quality learning head (H-head) and a low-quality learning
head (L-head). H-head purely learns with high-quality uncertainty maps to avoid
error accumulation and keeps strong prediction ability, while L-head leverages
the low-quality uncertainty maps to assist the backbone to learn maximum
representation knowledge. UNet with H-head will be reserved during the
inference stage, and the rest of the modules can be removed freely for
computational efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on an unsupervised

significant challenges in the computer security system is the kernel-level

the kernel, it is difficult for user-level security tools to detect the
kernel-level rootkits. In the past few years, many approaches have been
proposed to detect kernel-level rootkits. It is not much difficult for an
attacker to evade the signature-based kernel-level rootkit detection system by
slightly modifying the existing signature. To detect the evolving kernel-level
rootkits, researchers have proposed and experimented with many detection
systems. In this paper, we survey traditional kernel-level rootkit detection
mechanisms in literature and propose a structured kernel-level rootkit

is becoming more prevalent to assist humans in their daily decision-making

discovered that there is a tradeoff between the accuracy and fairness of these
decision-making tasks. In some cases, these AI systems can be unfair by
exhibiting bias or discrimination against certain social groups, which can have
severe consequences in real life. Inspired by one of the most well-known human
learning skills called grouping, we address this issue by proposing a novel
machine learning framework where the ML model learns to group a diverse set of
problems into distinct subgroups to solve each subgroup using its specific
sub-model. Our proposed framework involves three stages of learning, which are
formulated as a three-level optimization problem: (i) learning to group
problems into different subgroups; (ii) learning group-specific sub-models for
problem-solving; and (iii) updating group assignments of training examples by
minimizing the validation loss. These three learning stages are performed
end-to-end in a joint manner using gradient descent. To improve fairness and
accuracy, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm to solve this
three-level optimization problem. To further reduce the risk of overfitting in
small datasets, we incorporate domain adaptation techniques in the second stage
of training. We further apply our method to neural architecture search.
Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate our method's
effectiveness and performance improvements in both fairness and accuracy. Our
proposed Learning by Grouping can reduce overfitting and achieve
state-of-the-art performances with fixed human-designed network architectures

Design/Methodology/Approach: The research was carried out in 2019 in 55 groups
of Indian manufacturing industry within six major Indian industrial states.
Mainly, the research used the modified VES (Variable Elasticity Substitution)
estimation model. The research focused on the value of the additional
substitution parameter of capital intensity (mu > 0). Findings: Almost all
selected industry groups with in six states need capital-intensive production.
The results found additional parameter of capital intensity (mu) is greater
than zero for all industry groups. It means that a higher product per man can
be obtained by increasing the capital per worker. Practical Implications:
Research shows that an increasingly need for capital investment in need for
higher labor productivity is likely to induce the manufacturing unit to use
more capacity in existence. It reveals that investors in these selected six
states can increase their capital investment. Originality/Value: The analysis
of the result allowed to determine the fact that capital intensity is an

modality characteristics of Hyperspectral Image (HSI) and Light Detection And
Ranging (LiDAR). However, these methods consider the relationship of HSI-LiDAR
signals from limited perspectives. More specifically, they overlook the
contextual information across modalities of HSI and LiDAR and the
intra-modality characteristics of LiDAR. In this paper, we provide a new
insight into feature fusion to explore the relationships across HSI and LiDAR
modalities comprehensively. An Interconnected Fusion (IF) framework is
proposed. Firstly, the center patch of the HSI input is extracted and
replicated to the size of the HSI input. Then, nine different perspectives in
the fusion matrix are generated by calculating self-attention and
cross-attention among the replicated center patch, HSI input, and corresponding
LiDAR input. In this way, the intra- and inter-modality characteristics can be
fully exploited, and contextual information is considered in both
intra-modality and inter-modality manner. These nine interrelated elements in
the fusion matrix can complement each other and eliminate biases, which can
generate a multi-modality representation for classification accurately.
Extensive experiments have been conducted on three widely used datasets:
Trento, MUUFL, and Houston. The IF framework achieves state-of-the-art results
on these datasets compared to existing approaches.

learning (PLL) methods are still vulnerable to the high ratio of noisy partial
labels, especially in a large labelling space. To learn a more robust model, we
present Adversary-Aware Partial Label Learning and introduce the
$\textit{rival}$, a set of noisy labels, to the collection of candidate labels
for each instance. By introducing the rival label, the predictive distribution
of PLL is factorised such that a handy predictive label is achieved with less
uncertainty coming from the transition matrix, assuming the rival generation
process is known. Nonetheless, the predictive accuracy is still insufficient to
produce an sufficiently accurate positive sample set to leverage the clustering
effect of the contrastive loss function. Moreover, the inclusion of rivals also
brings an inconsistency issue for the classifier and risk function due to the
intractability of the transition matrix. Consequently, an adversarial teacher

function. In addition, our method has shown high resiliency to the choice of
the label noise transition matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our

formulated as a problem of minimization of point-to-model distance, which is

is affected by distance metric. In this paper, we proposed a novel distance
metric called the axial distance, which is converted from the algebraic
distance by introducing a scaling factor to solve nongeometric problems of the
algebraic distance. There is complementarity between the axial distance and
Sampson distance because their combination is a stricter metric when
calculating the model score of sample consensus and the weight of the weighted
least squares (WLS) fitting. Subsequently, a novel sample-consensus-based
ellipsoid fitting method is proposed by using the combination between the axial
distance and Sampson distance (CAS). We compare the proposed method with
several representative fitting methods through experiments on synthetic and
real datasets. The results show that the proposed method has a higher
robustness against outliers, consistently high accuracy, and a speed close to

electromagnetic fields on the background constant magnetic field. The Wigner
function is separated into an equilibrium part in the background magnetic field
and an off-equilibrium part induced by perturbative fields. The analytical
expression for the equilibrium part and the corresponding equilibrium
conditions are given. For the off-equilibrium part, we obtain the kinetic
equation at the leading order in $\hbar$ from the master equation of the Wigner
function. When perturbative fields only depend on the proper time, the
off-equilibrium part can be analytically solved from which the vector and axial
vector currents are obtained. We obtain the longitudinal and transverse Ohm
conductivities as well as Hall conductivity as the linear response of the
vector current to the perturbative electric field. The behaviors of these
conductivities as functions of the evolving time, relaxation time, particle
mass, and strength of the background magnetic field are investigated both
analytically and numerically.

fractional excitations, itinerant Majorana fermions and localized fluxes. Since
these fractional excitations could be utilized for quantum computing, how to
create, observe, and control them through the spin degree of freedom is a
central issue. Here, we study dynamical spin transport in the Kitaev-Heisenberg
model by applying an AC magnetic field to an edge of the system. We find that,
in the Kitaev QSL phase, spin polarizations at the other edge are resonantly
induced in a specific spin component, even though the static spin correlations
are vanishingly small. This inter-edge spin resonance appears around the input
frequency over the broad frequency range. Comparing with the dynamical spin
correlations, we clarify that the resonance is governed by the itinerant
Majorana fermions with a broad continuum excitation spectrum, which can
propagate over long distances, although it vanishes for the pure Kitaev model
because of accidental degeneracy and requires weak Heisenberg interactions. We
also find that the spin polarizations in the other spin components are weakly
induced at an almost constant frequency close to the excitation gap of the
localized fluxes, irrespective of the input frequency. These results
demonstrate that the dynamical spin transport is a powerful probe of the
fractional excitations in the Kitaev QSL. Possible experimental realization of
the inter-edge spin resonance is discussed.

to the strong spatial noise correlation, including the advanced self-supervised

they either suffer from ignoring this spatial correlation, or are limited by
the destruction of fine textures for under-considering the correlation. In this
paper, we present a novel method called LG-BPN for self-supervised real-world
denoising, which takes the spatial correlation statistic into our network
design for local detail restoration, and also brings the long-range
dependencies modeling ability to previously CNN-based BSN methods. First, based
on the correlation statistic, we propose a densely-sampled patch-masked
convolution module. By taking more neighbor pixels with low noise correlation
into account, we enable a denser local receptive field, preserving more useful
information for enhanced fine structure recovery. Second, we propose a dilated
Transformer block to allow distant context exploitation in BSN. This global
perception addresses the intrinsic deficiency of BSN, whose receptive field is
constrained by the blind spot requirement, which can not be fully resolved by
the previous CNN-based BSNs. These two designs enable LG-BPN to fully exploit
both the detailed structure and the global interaction in a blind manner.

in this paper. With the momentum feedback during the flight phase, landing
locations can be updated to minimize the influence of uncertainties from

The results of our first econometric exercise indicate a cointegration
relationship between fertility and economic performance, education and infant
mortality, with differences observed by reproductive stage. We find a negative
relationship between income and fertility for women aged 20-29 that persists
for women aged 30 and over. This result suggests that having children is
perceived as an opportunity cost for women in this age group. We also observe a
negative relationship between education and adolescent fertility, which has
implications for the design of public policies. A panel data analysis with
econometric techniques allowing us to control for unobserved heterogeneity
confirms that income is a relevant factor for all groups of women and
reinforces the crucial role of education in reducing teenage fertility. We also
identify a negative correlation between fertility and employment rates for
women aged 30 and above. We outline some possible explanations for these
findings in the context of work-life balance issues and argue for the
importance of implementing social policies to address them.

oscillatory Newtonian fluid flow and a compliant conduit. We consider the
canonical geometries of a 2D channel with a deformable top wall and an
axisymmetric deformable tube. Focusing on the hydrodynamics, we employ a linear
relationship between wall displacement and hydrodynamic pressure, which has
been shown to be suitable for a leading-order-in-slenderness theory. The
slenderness assumption also allows the use of lubrication theory, and the flow
rate is related to the pressure gradient (and the tube/wall deformation) via
the classical solutions for oscillatory flow in a channel and in a tube
(attributed to Womersley). Then, by two-way coupling the oscillatory flow and
the wall deformation via the continuity equation, a one-dimensional nonlinear
partial differential equation (PDE) governing the instantaneous pressure
distribution along the conduit, without \textit{a priori} assumptions on the
magnitude of the oscillation frequency (\textit{i.e.}, at arbitrary Womersley
number). We find that the cycle-averaged pressure (for harmonic
pressure-controlled conditions) deviates from the expected steady pressure
distribution, suggesting the presence of a streaming flow. An analytical
perturbative solution for a weakly deformable conduit is obtained to
rationalize how FSI induces such streaming. In the case of a compliant tube,
the results obtained from the proposed reduced-order PDE and its perturbative
solutions are validated against three-dimensional, two-way-coupled direct
numerical simulations. We find good agreement between theory and simulations
for a range of dimensionless parameters characterizing the oscillatory flow and
the FSI, demonstrating the validity of the proposed theory of oscillatory flows
in compliant conduits at arbitrary Womersley number.

of a list and predict subsequent items. Recently, Transformer-based models have
shown promise in comprehending contextual information and capturing item
relationships in a list. However, deploying them in real-time industrial
applications is challenging, mainly because the autoregressive generation
mechanism used in them is time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel
fast non-autoregressive sequence generation model, namely FANS, to enhance
inference efficiency and quality for item list continuation. First, we use a
non-autoregressive generation mechanism to decode next $K$ items simultaneously
instead of one by one in existing models. Then, we design a two-stage
classifier to replace the vanilla classifier used in current transformer-based
models to further reduce the decoding time. Moreover, to improve the quality of
non-autoregressive generation, we employ a curriculum learning strategy to
optimize training. Experimental results on four real-world item list
continuation datasets including Zhihu, Spotify, AotM, and Goodreads show that
our FANS model can significantly improve inference efficiency (up to 8.7x)
while achieving competitive or better generation quality for item list
continuation compared with the state-of-the-art autoregressive models. We also
validate the efficiency of FANS in an industrial setting. Our source code and

moderate negative charge aid in ECM entanglement and solubility. This allows it
to effectively foster gel-like conditions, which are critical for supporting
and protecting cells in various tissues. As a recognized ligand for multiple
proteins, understanding its interaction with various amino acids helps
elucidate its biological functions. This study employs NMR and molecular
dynamics simulations (MD) to explore a potential general molecular mechanism
for hyaluronan-protein interactions. We examine the binding of short arginine,
lysine, or glycine oligopeptides to hyaluronan polysaccharides, using chemical
shift perturbation (CSP) to detect changes in hyaluronan's 1H NMR spectra upon
peptide titration. CSP helps to identify concrete binding regions and offers
insights into the relative interaction strength of the peptides. We also use
nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurements to identify a potentially stable
hyaluronan-peptide complex. However, the lack of NOE signals does not support
the formation of strong and defined complexes. The combination of a positive
CSP signal and negative NOE suggests a dynamic binding mode without stable
complex formation, which MD further supports. Arginine, a positively charged
amino acid, exhibits the strongest binding to the negatively charged
hyaluronan, with the similarly charged lysine coming in distant second,
highlighting the significance of electrostatics and side-chain specificity in
these interactions. Hyaluronan's carboxyl and amide groups drive its

especially when robots are constantly moving around the environment and there
are malicious attacks within the network. Various approaches in the literature
exist for detecting malicious robots, such as message sampling or suspicious
behavior analysis. However, these approaches require every robot to sample
every other robot in the network, leading to a slow detection process that
degrades team performance. This paper introduces a method that significantly
decreases the detection time for legitimate robots to identify malicious robots
in a scenario where legitimate robots are randomly moving around the
environment. Our method leverages the concept of ``Dynamic Crowd Vetting"" by
utilizing observations from random encounters and trusted neighboring robots'
opinions to quickly improve the accuracy of detecting malicious robots. The key
intuition is that as long as each legitimate robot accurately estimates the
legitimacy of at least some fixed subset of the team, the second-hand
information they receive from trusted neighbors is enough to correct any
misclassifications and provide accurate trust estimations of the rest of the
team. We show that the size of this fixed subset can be characterized as a
function of fundamental graph and random walk properties. Furthermore, we
formally show that as the number of robots in the team increases the detection
time remains constant. We develop a closed form expression for the critical
number of time-steps required for our algorithm to successfully identify the
true legitimacy of each robot to within a specified failure probability. Our
theoretical results are validated through simulations demonstrating significant
reductions in detection time when compared to previous works that do not
leverage trusted neighbor information.

dominant Kitaev coupling $K$. Based on this effective model, an intermediate
QSL phase in presence of an out-of-plane fields along the $[1 1 1]$ direction,
between the low-field zigzag order and high-field polarized phase, has been
predicted. By combining density matrix renormalization group (DMRG),
exponential tensor renormalization group (XTRG), and variational Monte Carlo
(VMC) calculations, we address the nature of this QSL phase in the honeycomb
$K$-$J$-$\Gamma$-$\Gamma'$ model under the $[1 1 1]$-direction field. Our DMRG
calculations find the algebraic-like decay of spin correlation function, the
finite spin scalar chiral order, and lattice nematic order. Together with the

naturally suggest a gapless nematic chiral spin liquid. On the other hand, our

very close to that obtained in DMRG. As VMC finds a very small gap that is
beyond the current resolution of both ground-state DMRG and finite-temperature
XTRG calculations on finite-width cylinders, we resort the full clarification

commercially purchased LuH2 powder remain metallic but exhibit thousands of
times higher resistivity, while additional grinding of LuH2 powders in air
further enhances the resistivity and even results in weakly localized
behaviors. For these CP samples, interestingly, we can occasionally observe
abrupt resistivity drops at high temperatures, which also show dependences on
magnetic fields and electrical current. Measurements of variable-temperature
XRD, magnetic susceptibility, and specific heat exclude the possibilities of
structural, magnetic, and superconducting transitions for the observed
resistivity drops. Instead, we tentatively attribute these above observations
to the presence of insulating layers on the grain surface due to the
modification of hydrogen stoichiometry or the pollution by oxygen/nitrogen.
Percolation of the metallic grains through the insulating surfaces can explain
the sudden drop in resistivity. The present results thus call for caution in
asserting the resistivity drops as superconductivity and invalidate the
background subtraction in analyzing the resistivity data.

nanomaterials, but it can cause damage to samples due to high electron doses
and long exposure times. To minimize such damage, researchers often reduce beam
exposure by acquiring fewer projections through tilt undersampling. However,
this approach can also introduce reconstruction artifacts due to insufficient
sampling. Therefore, it is important to determine the optimal number of
projections that minimizes both beam exposure and undersampling artifacts for
accurate reconstructions of beam-sensitive samples. Current methods for
determining this optimal number of projections involve acquiring and
post-processing multiple reconstructions with different numbers of projections,
which can be time-consuming and requires multiple samples due to sample damage.
To improve this process, we propose a protocol that combines golden ratio
scanning and quasi-3D reconstruction to estimate the optimal number of
projections in real-time during a single acquisition. This protocol was
validated using simulated and realistic nanoparticles, and was successfully
applied to reconstruct two beam-sensitive metal-organic framework complexes.

neighbourhood relationship of the data in high dimension remains preserved in
lower dimension. The performance of NeuroDAVIS has been evaluated on a wide

transportation for the residents of urban areas. As a fundamental problem,
route recommendation for these platforms is vital for their sustenance. The
works done in this direction have recommended routes with higher passenger
demand. Despite the existing works, statistics have suggested that these
services cause increased greenhouse emissions compared to private vehicles as
they roam around in search of riders. This analysis provides finer details
regarding the functionality of ridesharing systems and it reveals that in the
face of their boom, they have not utilized the vehicle capacity efficiently. We
propose to overcome the above limitations and recommend routes that will fetch
multiple passengers simultaneously which will result in increased vehicle
utilization and thereby decrease the effect of these systems on the
environment. As route recommendation is NP-hard, we propose a k-hop-based
sliding window approximation algorithm that reduces the search space from
entire road network to a window. We further demonstrate that maximizing
expected demand is submodular and greedy algorithms can be used to optimize our
objective function within a window. We evaluate our proposed model on

involved entities, plays an important role in many real applications. Previous
works mostly over-simplify this task as detecting abnormal pair-wise
interactions. However, real-world events may contain multi-typed attributed
entities and complex interactions among them, which forms an Attributed
Heterogeneous Information Network (AHIN). With the boom of social networks,
abnormal event detection in AHIN has become an important, but seldom explored
task. In this paper, we firstly study the unsupervised abnormal event detection
problem in AHIN. The events are considered as star-schema instances of AHIN and
are further modeled by hypergraphs. A novel hypergraph contrastive learning
method, named AEHCL, is proposed to fully capture abnormal event patterns.
AEHCL designs the intra-event and inter-event contrastive modules to exploit
self-supervised AHIN information. The intra-event contrastive module captures
the pair-wise and multivariate interaction anomalies within an event, and the
inter-event module captures the contextual anomalies among events. These two
modules collaboratively boost the performance of each other and improve the
detection results. During the testing phase, a contrastive learning-based
abnormal event score function is further proposed to measure the abnormality
degree of events. Extensive experiments on three datasets in different
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of AEHCL, and the results improve

input in both spatial and temporal manners using binary spikes. However, we
observe that the information capacity in SNNs is affected by the number of
timesteps, leading to an accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. In this work, we study a
fine-grained adjustment of the number of timesteps in SNNs. Specifically, we
treat the number of timesteps as a variable conditioned on different input
samples to reduce redundant timesteps for certain data. We call our method
Spiking Early-Exit Neural Networks (SEENNs). To determine the appropriate
number of timesteps, we propose SEENN-I which uses a confidence score
thresholding to filter out the uncertain predictions, and SEENN-II which
determines the number of timesteps by reinforcement learning. Moreover, we
demonstrate that SEENN is compatible with both the directly trained SNN and the
ANN-SNN conversion. By dynamically adjusting the number of timesteps, our SEENN
achieves a remarkable reduction in the average number of timesteps during
inference. For example, our SEENN-II ResNet-19 can achieve 96.1% accuracy with
an average of 1.08 timesteps on the CIFAR-10 test dataset.

the decay of the dipole kernel is sufficiently fast when the lattice sums run
over one and two dimensions, and is also consistent with prior work on
dimension reduction of continuum micromagnetic bodies to the thin film limit.

"2305.02271","Reiner Czerwinski","Reiner Czerwinski","$L$ is unequal $NL$ under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis",,,,,"cs.CC cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Due to Savitch's theorem we know $NL\subseteq DSPACE(\log^2(n))$. To show
this upper bound, Savitch constructed an algorithm with $O(\log^2(n))$ space on
the working tape. We will show that Savitch's algorithm also described a lower
bound under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis. Every algorithm for the
Connectivity Problem needs $O(\log^2(n))$ space in this case.

base-free form in real geometric algebras (GAs) Cl(p,q) are presented for all
n=p+q=3. In contrast to logarithm of complex numbers (isomorphic to Cl(0,1), 3D
logarithmic functions, due to appearance of two double angle arc tangent
functions, allow to include two sets of sheets characterized by discrete
coefficients. Formulas for generic and special cases of individual blades and
their combinations are provided.

It
contains especially rich built-in support for dealing with vectors, arrays, and
matrices. These operations feature prominently in the applications that form
R's raison d'\^etre, making their behavior worth understanding. Furthermore,
ostensibly for programmer convenience, their behavior in R is a notable
extension over the corresponding operations in mathematics, thereby offering
some challenges for specification and static verification.
  We report on progress towards statically typing this aspect of the R
language. The interesting aspects of typing, in this case, warn programmers
about violating bounds, so the types must necessarily be dependent. We explain
the ways in which R extends standard mathematical behavior. We then show how
R's behavior can be specified in LiquidHaskell, a dependently-typed extension
to Haskell. In the general case, actually verifying library and client code is
currently beyond LiquidHaskell's reach; therefore, this work provides
challenges and opportunities both for typing R and for progress in
dependently-typed programming languages.

  Prediction Scheme Based on Neural ODE",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose an innovative learning-based channel prediction
scheme so as to achieve higher prediction accuracy and reduce the requirements
of huge amount and strict sequential format of channel data. Inspired by the
idea of the neural ordinary differential equation (Neural ODE), we first prove
that the channel prediction problem can be modeled as an ODE problem with a
known initial value through analyzing the physical process of electromagnetic
wave propagation within a varying space. Then, we design a novel
physics-inspired spatial channel gradient network (SCGNet), which represents
the derivative process of channel varying as a special neural network and can
obtain the gradients at any relative displacement needed for the ODE solving.
With the SCGNet, the static channel at any location served by the base station
is accurately inferred through consecutive propagation and integration.
Finally, we design an efficient recurrent positioning algorithm based on some
prior knowledge of user mobility to obtain the velocity vector, and propose an
approximate Doppler compensation method to make up the instantaneous
angular-delay domain channel. Only discrete historical channel data is needed
for the training, whereas only a few fresh channel measurements is needed for
the prediction, which ensures the scheme's practicability.

ability to perform a variety of dexterous manipulation tasks. Advantages of
their use can be attributed to the high resolution tactile data and 3D depth
map reconstructions they can provide. Unfortunately, many of these tactile
sensors use either a flat sensing surface, sense on only one side of the
sensor's body, or have a bulky form-factor, making it difficult to integrate
the sensors with a variety of robotic grippers. Of the camera-based sensors
that do have all-around, curved sensing surfaces, many cannot provide 3D depth
maps; those that do often require optical designs specified to a particular
sensor geometry. In this work, we introduce GelSight360, a fingertip-like,
omnidirectional, camera-based tactile sensor capable of producing depth maps of

cross-LED lighting scheme that can be implemented in different all-around

agent strategies evolve in response to the evolving strategies of other agents.
Of particular interest is whether or not agent strategies converge to well
known solution concepts such as Nash Equilibrium (NE). Most ``fixed order''
learning dynamics restrict an agent's underlying state to be its own strategy.
In ``higher order'' learning, agent dynamics can include auxiliary states that
can capture phenomena such as path dependencies. We introduce higher-order
gradient play dynamics that resemble projected gradient ascent with auxiliary
states. The dynamics are ``payoff based'' in that each agent's dynamics depend
on its own evolving payoff. While these payoffs depend on the strategies of
other agents in a game setting, agent dynamics do not depend explicitly on the
nature of the game or the strategies of other agents. In this sense, dynamics
are ``uncoupled'' since an agent's dynamics do not depend explicitly on the
utility functions of other agents. We first show that for any specific game
with an isolated completely mixed-strategy NE, there exist higher-order
gradient play dynamics that lead (locally) to that NE, both for the specific
game and nearby games with perturbed utility functions. Conversely, we show
that for any higher-order gradient play dynamics, there exists a game with a
unique isolated completely mixed-strategy NE for which the dynamics do not lead
to NE. These results build on prior work that showed that uncoupled fixed-order
learning cannot lead to NE in certain instances, whereas higher-order variants
can. Finally, we consider the mixed-strategy equilibrium associated with
coordination games. While higher-order gradient play can converge to such
equilibria, we show such dynamics must be inherently internally unstable.

core rotation at the core bounce. A dominant source of time changing quadrupole
moment is the $l=2$ fundamental mode ($f-$ mode) oscillation of the
proto-neutron star. From the time-frequency spectrogram of the
gravitational-wave strain we see that, starting $\sim 400$ ms after the core
bounce, most of the power lies within a narrow track that represents the
frequency evolution of the $f-$mode oscillations. The $f-$mode frequencies
obtained from linear perturbation analysis of the angle-averaged profile of the
protoneutron star corroborate what we observe in the spectrograms of the
gravitational-wave signal. We explore the measurability of the $f-$mode
frequency evolution of protoneutron star for a supernova signal observed in the
third-generation gravitational-wave detectors. Measurement of the frequency
evolution can reveal information about the masses, radii, and densities of the
proto-neutron stars. We find that if the third generation detectors observe a
supernova within 10 kpc, we can measure these frequencies to within $\sim$90\%
accuracy. We can also measure the energy emitted in the fundamental $f-$mode

we demonstrate a novel vector spectrum analyzer (VSA) that is capable to
characterize passive devices and active laser sources in one setup. Such a
dual-mode VSA can measure loss, phase response and dispersion property of
passive devices. It also can coherently map a broadband laser spectrum into the

frequency resolution of 99 kHz, and dynamic range of 56 dB. Meanwhile, our
fiber-based VSA is compact and robust. It requires neither high-speed
modulators and photodetectors, nor any active feedback control. Finally, we
successfully employ our VSA for applications including characterization of
integrated dispersive waveguides, mapping frequency comb spectra, and coherent
light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Our VSA presents an innovative approach

render high-resolution images at depths unattainable with optical microscopy.
Recently, laser ultrasound has further been suggested as a means of generating
broadband acoustic waves for high-resolution pulse-echo ultrasound imaging.
Herein, we propose an approach to simultaneously interrogate biological tissues
with light and ultrasound based on layer-by-layer coating of silica optical
fibers with a controlled degree of transparency. We exploit the time separation
between optoacoustic signals and ultrasound echoes collected with a custom-made
spherical array transducer for simultaneous three-dimensional optoacoustic and
laser ultrasound (OPLUS) imaging with a single laser pulse. OPLUS is shown to
enable large-scale comprehensive anatomical characterization of tissues along
with functional multi-spectral imaging of spectrally-distinctive chromophores
and assessment of cardiac dynamics at ultrafast rates only limited by the pulse
repetition frequency of the laser. The suggested approach provides a flexible
and scalable means for developing a new generation of systems synergistically
combining the powerful capabilities of optoacoustics and ultrasound imaging in
biology and medicine.

Gaia22alz, over its gradual rise to peak brightness that lasted 180 days.
During the first 50 days, when the nova was only 3--4 magnitudes above its
normal brightness, the spectra showed narrow (FWHM $\approx$ 400 km s$^{-1}$)
emission lines of H Balmer, He I, He II, and C IV, but no P Cygni absorption. A
few weeks later, the high-excitation He II and C IV lines disappeared, and P
Cygni profiles of Balmer, He I, and eventually Fe II lines emerged, yielding a
spectrum typical of classical novae before peak. We propose that the early
spectra of Gaia22alz are produced in the white dwarf's envelope or accretion
disk, reprocessing X-ray and ultraviolet emission from the white dwarf after a
dramatic increase in the rate of thermonuclear reactions, during a phase known
as the ``early X-ray/UV flash''. If true, this would be one of the rare times
that the optical signature of the early X-ray/UV flash has been detected. While
this phase might last only a few hours in other novae and thus be easily
missed, it was possible to detect in Gaia22alz due to its very slow and gradual
rise and thanks to the efficiency of new all-sky surveys in detecting
transients on their rise. We also consider alternative scenarios that could
explain the early spectral features of Gaia22alz and its unusually slow rise.

crucial, the use of Bayesian inference for models with a stochastic process as
their prior, e.g. Gaussian processes (GPs) is ubiquitous. Recent literature has
demonstrated that the computational bottleneck caused by GP priors or their
finite realizations can be encoded using deep generative models such as
variational autoencoders (VAEs), and the learned generators can then be used
instead of the original priors during Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference
in a drop-in manner. While this approach enables fast and highly efficient
inference, it loses information about the stochastic process hyperparameters,
and, as a consequence, makes inference over hyperparameters impossible and the
learned priors indistinct. We propose to resolve this issue and disentangle the
learned priors by conditioning the VAE on stochastic process hyperparameters.
This way, the hyperparameters are encoded alongside GP realisations and can be
explicitly estimated at the inference stage. We believe that the new method,

successful deployment of geoscience applications such as geothermal energy
extraction and geo-storage of fluids. These simulators provide time-laps
dynamics of the coupled poro-mechanical processes within the reservoir and its
over-, under-, and side-burden environments. For more reliable operations, it
is crucial to connect these reservoir simulation results with the seismic
surveys (i.e., observation data). However, despite being crucial, such
integration is challenging due to the fact that the reservoir dynamics alters
the seismic parameters. In this work, a coupled reservoir simulation and
time-lapse seismic methodology is developed for multiphase flow operations in
subsurface reservoirs. To this end, a poromechanical simulator is designed for
multiphase flow and connected to a forward seismic modeller. This simulator is
then used to assess a novel methodology of seismic monitoring by isolating the
reservoir signal from the entire reflection response. This methodology is shown
to be able to track the development of the fluid front over time, even in the
presence of a highly reflective overburden with strong time-lapse variations.
These results suggest that the proposed methodology can contribute to a better
understanding of fluid flow in the subsurface. Ultimately, this will lead to
improved monitoring of reservoirs for underground energy storage or production.

performance by training over many similar tasks, especially with deep neural

overparameterized models such as DNNs can generalize well in meta-learning is
still limited. As an initial step towards addressing this challenge, this paper
studies the generalization performance of overfitted meta-learning under a
linear regression model with Gaussian features. In contrast to a few recent
studies along the same line, our framework allows the number of model
parameters to be arbitrarily larger than the number of features in the ground
truth signal, and hence naturally captures the overparameterized regime in
practical deep meta-learning. We show that the overfitted min $\ell_2$-norm
solution of model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) can be beneficial, which is
similar to the recent remarkable findings on ``benign overfitting'' and
``double descent'' phenomenon in the classical (single-task) linear regression.
However, due to the uniqueness of meta-learning such as task-specific gradient
descent inner training and the diversity/fluctuation of the ground-truth
signals among training tasks, we find new and interesting properties that do
not exist in single-task linear regression. We first provide a high-probability
upper bound (under reasonable tightness) on the generalization error, where
certain terms decrease when the number of features increases. Our analysis
suggests that benign overfitting is more significant and easier to observe when
the noise and the diversity/fluctuation of the ground truth of each training
task are large. Under this circumstance, we show that the overfitted min
$\ell_2$-norm solution can achieve an even lower generalization error than the
underparameterized solution.

apply the inverse Fourier transform to extract the source image. Specially, we
modify the representation of the frequency-domain wavefield to inherently
satisfy the boundary conditions (the measured data on the surface) by means of
the hard constraint, which helps to avoid the difficulty in balancing the data

implementation with respect to depth to enhance the convergence of PINNs. The
numerical experiments on the Overthrust model show that the method can admit
reliable and accurate source imaging for single- or multiple- sources and even
in passive monitoring settings. Then, we further apply our method on the

of heterogeneous data distribution. The goal of IDKD is to homogenize the data
distribution across the nodes. While such data homogenization can be achieved
by exchanging data among the nodes sacrificing privacy, IDKD achieves the same
objective using a common public dataset across nodes without breaking the
privacy constraint. This public dataset is different from the training dataset
and is used to distill the knowledge from each node and communicate it to its
neighbors through the generated labels. With traditional knowledge
distillation, the generalization of the distilled model is reduced because all
the public dataset samples are used irrespective of their similarity to the
local dataset. Thus, we introduce an Out-of-Distribution (OoD) detector at each
node to label a subset of the public dataset that maps close to the local
training data distribution. Finally, only labels corresponding to these subsets
are exchanged among the nodes and with appropriate label averaging each node is
finetuned on these data subsets along with its local data. Our experiments on
multiple image classification datasets and graph topologies show that the
proposed IDKD scheme is more effective than traditional knowledge distillation
and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on heterogeneously
distributed data with minimal communication overhead.

several key issues when using pretrained embedding in a real-world production
system, many of which cannot be fully explained by current knowledge.
Unfortunately, we find that there is a lack of a thorough understanding of how

interactions with downstream tasks. Consequently, it becomes challenging to
make interactive and scalable decisions regarding the use of pre-trained
embeddings in practice.
  Our investigation leads to two significant discoveries about using pretrained

establish a principled perspective of pre-trained embeddings via the lens of
kernel analysis, which can be used to evaluate their predictability,
interactively and scalably. These findings help to address the practical
challenges we faced and offer valuable guidance for successful adoption of
pretrained embeddings in real-world production. Our conclusions are backed by

of a particular eigenvalue of a smooth parametric family of self-adjoint
matrices, with the parameter space often being known and simple, such as a
torus. Among particular settings where such a question arises are the
Floquet--Bloch decomposition of periodic Schroedinger operators, topology of
potential energy surfaces in quantum chemistry, spectral optimization problems
such as minimal spectral partitions of manifolds, as well as nodal statistics
of graph eigenfunctions. In contrast to the classical Morse theory dealing with
smooth functions, the eigenvalues of families of self-adjoint matrices are not
smooth at the points corresponding to repeated eigenvalues (called, depending
on the application and on the dimension of the parameter space, the
diabolical/Dirac/Weyl points or the conical intersections).
  This work develops a procedure for associating a Morse polynomial to a point
of eigenvalue multiplicity; it utilizes the assumptions of smoothness and
self-adjointness of the family to provide concrete answers. In particular, we
define the notions of non-degenerate topologically critical point and
generalized Morse family, establish that generalized Morse families are generic
in an appropriate sense, establish a differential first-order conditions for
criticality, as well as compute the local contribution of a topologically
critical point to the Morse polynomial. Remarkably, the non-smooth contribution
to the Morse polynomial turns out to be universal: it depends only on the size
of the eigenvalue multiplicity and the relative position of the eigenvalue of
interest and not on the particulars of the operator family; it is expressed in
terms of the homologies of Grassmannians.

an existing unsupervised segmentation network to split the shape and obtain
over-segmentation. Then, we apply hierarchical merging with our novel
tightness-aware merging and stopping criteria. To overcome the sensitivity to
the initialization, we also refine the bounding box parameters in a game setup
with a soft reward function promoting a wider exploration. Lastly, we further
improve the bounding boxes with a MCTS-based multi-action space exploration.

than 30 fs in pulse duration and 830 nm in wavelength, and the photon energy
(1.49 eV) of the light pulses is close to the interband transition threshold

induced by the light irradiation is detected through the change in the
transient reflectivity, which is dominated by the thermalized (Th) electron
signal. We uncovered the position dependency of the transient reflectivity
change and the Th electronic signal amplitude of the 100 nm-thick Al films on
160 $\mu$m, 200 $\mu$m and 240 $\mu$m-length cantilevers, and these results are
in excellent agreement with two temperature model-based curve fits.

through zero value, the famous adiabatic invariant ratio of energy to frequency
is reestablished again, but with the proportionality coefficient higher than in
the initial state. The concrete value of this proportionality coefficient
depends on the power index of the frequency dependence on time near zero point.
In particular, the adiabatic ratio of the initial ground state (with zero
radial and angular quantum numbers) triplicates if the frequency tends to zero
linearly as function of time. If the Larmor frequency attains zero more than
once, the adiabatic proportionality coefficient strongly depends on the lengths
of the time intervals between zero points, so that the mean energy behavior can
be quasi-stochastic after many passages through zero value. The original
Born-Fock adiabatic theorem does not work after the frequency passes through
zero. However, its generalization is found: the initial Fock state becomes a
wide superposition of many instantaneous Fock states, whose weights do not
depend on time in the new adiabatic regime.

distribution in the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. We fully
characterize the interplay among three desired properties for policy design:
worst-case optimality, instance-dependent consistency, and light-tailed risk.
We show how the order of expected regret exactly affects the decaying rate of
the regret tail probability for both the worst-case and instance-dependent
scenario. A novel policy is proposed to characterize the optimal regret tail
probability for any regret threshold. Concretely, for any given $\alpha\in[1/2,
1)$ and $\beta\in[0, \alpha]$, our policy achieves a worst-case expected regret
of $\tilde O(T^\alpha)$ (we call it $\alpha$-optimal) and an instance-dependent
expected regret of $\tilde O(T^\beta)$ (we call it $\beta$-consistent), while
enjoys a probability of incurring an $\tilde O(T^\delta)$ regret
($\delta\geq\alpha$ in the worst-case scenario and $\delta\geq\beta$ in the
instance-dependent scenario) that decays exponentially with a polynomial $T$
term. Such decaying rate is proved to be best achievable. Moreover, we discover
an intrinsic gap of the optimal tail rate under the instance-dependent scenario
between whether the time horizon $T$ is known a priori or not. Interestingly,
when it comes to the worst-case scenario, this gap disappears. Finally, we
extend our proposed policy design to (1) a stochastic multi-armed bandit
setting with non-stationary baseline rewards, and (2) a stochastic linear
bandit setting. Our results reveal insights on the trade-off between regret
expectation and regret tail risk for both worst-case and instance-dependent
scenarios, indicating that more sub-optimality and inconsistency leave space
for more light-tailed risk of incurring a large regret, and that knowing the
planning horizon in advance can make a difference on alleviating tail risks.

used to detect specific kinds of compatibility issues (i.e., compatibility
issues caused by API signature evolution), i.e., many other essential types of
compatibility issues are still unrevealed. For example, customized OS versions
on real devices and semantic changes of OS could lead to serious compatibility
issues, which are non-trivial to be detected statically. To this end, we
propose a novel, lightweight, crowdsourced testing approach, LAZYCOW, to fill
this research gap and enable the possibility of taming Android fragmentation
through crowdsourced efforts. Specifically, crowdsourced testing is an emerging
alternative to conventional mobile testing mechanisms that allow developers to
test their products on real devices to pinpoint platform-specific issues.
Experimental results on thousands of test cases on real-world Android devices
show that LAZYCOW is effective in automatically identifying and verifying
API-induced compatibility issues. Also, after investigating the user experience
through qualitative metrics, users' satisfaction provides strong evidence that
LAZYCOW is useful and welcome in practice.

have been detected with JWST, posing the question: are these observational
results surprising in the context of current galaxy formation models? We
address this question using the well-established Santa Cruz semi-analytic
models, implemented within merger trees from the new suite of cosmological
N-body simulations GUREFT, which were carefully designed for ultra-high
redshift studies. Using our fiducial models calibrated at z=0, we present
predictions for stellar mass functions, rest-frame UV luminosity functions, and
various scaling relations. We find that our (dust-free) models predict galaxy
number densities at z~11 (z~ 13) that are an order of magnitude (a factor of
~30) lower than the observational estimates. We estimate the uncertainty in the
observed number densities due to cosmic variance, and find that it leads to a
fractional error of 30-70% at z=11 (25-150% at z=13) for the available observed
fields. We explore which processes in our models are most likely to be
rate-limiting for the formation of luminous galaxies at these early epochs,
considering the halo formation rate, gas cooling, star formation, and stellar
feedback, and conclude that it is mainly efficient stellar-driven winds. We
find that a modest boost of a factor of ~4 to the UV luminosities, which could
arise from a top-heavy stellar initial mass function characteristic of Pop III
stars, would bring our current models into agreement with the observations.

widely adopted in novel-view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. It is still an
open and challenging problem to evaluate the geometry, i.e., the density field,
as the ground-truth is almost impossible to be obtained. One alternative
indirect solution is to transform the density field into a point-cloud and
compute its Chamfer Distance with the scanned ground-truth. However, many
widely-used datasets have no point-cloud ground-truth since the scanning
process along with the equipment is expensive and complicated. To this end, we
propose a novel metric, named Inverse Mean Residual Color (IMRC), which can
evaluate the geometry only with the observation images. Our key insight is that
the better the geometry is, the lower-frequency the computed color field is.
From this insight, given reconstructed density field and the observation
images, we design a closed-form method to approximate the color field with
low-frequency spherical harmonics and compute the inverse mean residual color.
Then the higher the IMRC, the better the geometry. Qualitative and quantitative
experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed IMRC metric. We
also benchmark several state-of-the-art methods using IMRC to promote future
related research.

systems is generically a hard task for classical algorithms. For a family of
Hamiltonians defined on an $m$-dimensional space of physical parameters, the
ground state and its properties at an arbitrary parameter configuration can be
predicted via a machine learning protocol up to a prescribed prediction error
$\varepsilon$, provided that a sample set (of size $N$) of the states can be
efficiently prepared and measured. In a recent work [Huang et al., Science 377,
eabk3333 (2022)], a rigorous guarantee for such an generalization was proved.
Unfortunately, an exponential scaling, $N = m^{ {\cal{O}}
\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon} \right) }$, was found to be universal for generic
gapped Hamiltonians. This result applies to the situation where the dimension
of the parameter space is large while the scaling with the accuracy is not an
urgent factor, not entering the realm of more precise learning and prediction.
In this work, we consider an alternative scenario, where $m$ is a finite, not
necessarily large constant while the scaling with the prediction error becomes
the central concern. By exploiting physical constraints and positive good
kernels for predicting the density matrix, we rigorously obtain an
exponentially improved sample complexity, $N = \mathrm{poly}
\left(\varepsilon^{-1}, n, \log \frac{1}{\delta}\right)$, where $\mathrm{poly}$
denotes a polynomial function; $n$ is the number of qubits in the system, and
($1-\delta$) is the probability of success. Moreover, if restricted to learning
ground-state properties with strong locality assumptions, the number of samples
can be further reduced to $N = \mathrm{poly} \left(\varepsilon^{-1}, \log
\frac{n}{\delta}\right)$. This provably rigorous result represents a
significant improvement and an indispensable extension of the existing work.

is associated with tokens of foreground targets, while token features of
foreground target will be transmitted into the next layer as much as possible,
and the useless token features of background area will be eliminated gradually
in the forward propagation. 2) Each category is solely associated with specific
sparse dimensions in the tokens. Based on the discoveries mentioned above, we
designed a two-stage calibration scheme, namely ViT-Calibrator, including token

neural networks also makes prior solutions infeasible for real-time deployment
in resource-constrained devices. We present an end-to-end deep reinforcement
learning (RL) solution called Eagle to train a neural network policy that
directly takes images as input to control the PTZ camera. Training
reinforcement learning is cumbersome in the real world due to labeling effort,
runtime environment stochasticity, and fragile experimental setups. We
introduce a photo-realistic simulation framework for training and evaluation of
PTZ camera control policies. Eagle achieves superior camera control performance
by maintaining the object of interest close to the center of captured images at
high resolution and has up to 17% more tracking duration than the
state-of-the-art. Eagle policies are lightweight (90x fewer parameters than
Yolo5s) and can run on embedded camera platforms such as Raspberry PI (33 FPS)
and Jetson Nano (38 FPS), facilitating real-time PTZ tracking for
resource-constrained environments. With domain randomization, Eagle policies
trained in our simulator can be transferred directly to real-world scenarios.

to have better inferential properties and more robust privacy considerations

establish the MSE consistency of the privacy-preserving estimators from the

in the number of partitions and privacy loss parameters. The theoretical
results also suggest that it is the sampling error of PAC data rather than the

conduct extensive simulation studies to compare the inferential utility of the

(CT) algorithm for the divergence-free constraint of magnetic fields,
completing its high-order competence. In this paper, we present the version in
Cartesian coordinates, which includes a fifth-order WENO and a fourth-order
five-stage SSPRK, along with extensive tests. With the new CT algorithm,
fifth-order accuracy is achieved in convergence tests involving the damping of
MHD waves in three-dimensional space. And substantially improved results are
obtained in magnetic loop advection and magnetic reconnection tests, indicating
a reduction in numerical diffusivity. In addition, the reliability and
robustness of the code, along with its high accuracy, are demonstrated through
several tests involving shocks and complex flows. Furthermore, tests of
turbulent flows reveal the advantages of high-order accuracy, and show the

new opportunities for designing advanced photon-photon colliders. Such
colliders have the potential to produce a large yield of linear Breit-Wheeler
(LBW) pairs in a single shot, which offers a unique platform for studying the
polarized LBW process. In our recent work [Phys. Rev. D 105, L071902(2022)], we
investigated the polarization characteristics of LBW pair production in CP
$\gamma$-photon collisions. To fully clarify the polarization effects involving
both CP and LP $\gamma$-photons, here we further investigate the LBW process
using the polarized cross section with explicit azimuthal-angle dependence due
to the base rotation of photon polarization vectors. We accomplished this by
defining a new spin basis for positrons and electrons, which enables us to
decouple the transverse and longitudinal spin components of $e^\pm$. By means
of analytical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the linear
polarization of photon can induce the highly angle-dependent pair yield and
polarization distributions. The comprehensive knowledge of the polarized LBW
process will also open up avenues for investigating the higher-order
photon-photon scattering, the laser-driven quantum electrodynamic plasmas and
the high-energy astrophysics.

to equip such models with the capability to harness various domain-specific
expert models for complex task-solving in the pursuit of Artificial General

demonstrated remarkable learning and reasoning abilities, making them promising
as a controller to select, synthesize, and execute external models to solve
complex tasks. In this project, we develop OpenAGI, an open-source AGI research
platform, specifically designed to offer complex, multi-step tasks and
accompanied by task-specific datasets, evaluation metrics, and a diverse range
of extensible models. OpenAGI formulates complex tasks as natural language
queries, serving as input to the LLM. The LLM subsequently selects,
synthesizes, and executes models provided by OpenAGI to address the task.
Furthermore, we propose a Reinforcement Learning from Task Feedback (RLTF)
mechanism, which uses the task-solving result as feedback to improve the LLM's
task-solving ability. Thus, the LLM is responsible for synthesizing various
external models for solving complex tasks, while RLTF provides feedback to

causal effect of a treatment on an outcome variable in the presence of
unmeasured confounding (Miao et al., 2018; Tchetgen Tchetgen et al., 2020). For
nonparametric point identification of causal effects, the framework leverages a
pair of so-called treatment and outcome confounding proxy variables, in order
to identify a bridge function that matches the dependence of potential outcomes
or treatment variables on the hidden factors to corresponding functions of
observed proxies. Unique identification of a causal effect via a bridge
function crucially requires that proxies are sufficiently relevant for hidden
factors, a requirement that has previously been formalized as a completeness
condition. However, completeness is well-known not to be empirically testable,
and although a bridge function may be well-defined in a given setting, lack of
completeness, sometimes manifested by availability of a single type of proxy,
may severely limit prospects for identification of a bridge function and thus a
causal effect; therefore, potentially restricting the application of the
proximal causal framework. In this paper, we propose partial identification
methods that do not require completeness and obviate the need for
identification of a bridge function. That is, we establish that proxies of
unobserved confounders can be leveraged to obtain bounds on the causal effect
of the treatment on the outcome even if available information does not suffice
to identify either a bridge function or a corresponding causal effect of
interest. We further establish analogous partial identification results in
related settings where identification hinges upon hidden mediators for which
proxies are available, however such proxies are not sufficiently rich for point
identification of a bridge function or a corresponding causal effect of
interest.

waves (e.g. P-wave reflections) and less sensitive to surface waves than
straight fiber. We examine these claims by burying a set of straight fibers
(SF) and helically wound fibers (HWF) with different wrapping angles, using
standard and engineered fibers. These fibers were buried in a 2 m deep trench
in a farmland in the province of Groningen in the Netherlands. They are linked
up to two interrogating systems and an electrically driven vibrator was used as
a seismic source. We observe in our field data that using HWF has a destructive
effect on the surface-wave amplitudes. Our data confirmed the effect of the
wrapping angle on the polarity of the surface-wave arrival and the dampening
effect of the helical winding, both behaving in quite a predictable fashion.
Apart from the effect of the wrapping angle, the different design choices, e.g.
cable filling and material type, did not show a significant effect on the
amplitude of the signals. As for P-wave reflections, we observe that both
engineered SF and HWF provide reflection images comparable to those obtained
from the geophone data despite the straight fiber's decreased broadside
sensitivity. A polarity reversal and an amplitude difference between SF and HWF
fibers are observed. Finally, we show that the combined use of SF and HWF
proved to be useful since SF showed better sensitivity in the shallower part
and HWF in the deeper part.

  Representation Learning on Graphs",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Unsupervised representation learning on (large) graphs has received
significant attention in the research community due to the compactness and
richness of the learned embeddings and the abundance of unlabelled graph data.
When deployed, these node representations must be generated with appropriate
fairness constraints to minimize bias induced by them on downstream tasks.
Consequently, group and individual fairness notions for graph learning
algorithms have been investigated for specific downstream tasks. One major
limitation of these fairness notions is that they do not consider the
connectivity patterns in the graph leading to varied node influence (or
centrality power). In this paper, we design a centrality-aware fairness
framework for inductive graph representation learning algorithms. We propose
CAFIN (Centrality Aware Fairness inducing IN-processing), an in-processing
technique that leverages graph structure to improve GraphSAGE's representations
- a popular framework in the unsupervised inductive setting. We demonstrate the
efficacy of CAFIN in the inductive setting on two popular downstream tasks -
Link prediction and Node Classification. Empirically, they consistently
minimize the disparity in fairness between groups across datasets (varying from
18 to 80% reduction in imparity, a measure of group fairness) from different
domains while incurring only a minimal performance cost.

and renders an extremely long spin lifetime, which can improve the performance
of potential spintronic devices. To achieve the PSH, a unidirectional spin
configuration is required in the momentum space. Here, T-XY (X$\neq$Y=P, As and
Sb) monolayers with dynamical, mechanical and thermal stabilities are predicted
to intrinsically possess PSH. Due to the $C_{2\upsilon}$ point-group symmetry,
a unidirectional spin configuration is preserved in the out-of-plane direction
for both conduction and valence bands around the high-symmetry $\Gamma$ point.
That is, the expectation value of the spin $S$ only has the out-of-plane

induce in-plane components $S_x$ and $S_y$, thus offering a promising platform

topic that is aimed at addressing the issues of large feature variations due to
cloth-changing and pedestrian view/pose changes. Although significant progress
has been achieved by introducing extra information (e.g., human contour
sketching information, human body keypoints, and 3D human information),
cloth-changing person ReID is still challenging due to impressionable
pedestrian representations. Moreover, human semantic information and pedestrian
identity information are not fully explored. To solve these issues, we propose
a novel identity-guided collaborative learning scheme (IGCL) for cloth-changing
person ReID, where the human semantic is fully utilized and the identity is
unchangeable to guide collaborative learning. First, we design a novel clothing
attention degradation stream to reasonably reduce the interference caused by
clothing information where clothing attention and mid-level collaborative
learning are employed. Second, we propose a human semantic attention and body
jigsaw stream to highlight the human semantic information and simulate
different poses of the same identity. In this way, the extraction features not
only focus on human semantic information that is unrelated to the background
but also are suitable for pedestrian pose variations. Moreover, a pedestrian
identity enhancement stream is further proposed to enhance the identity
importance and extract more favorable identity robust features. Most
importantly, all these streams are jointly explored in an end-to-end unified
framework, and the identity is utilized to guide the optimization. Extensive
experiments on five public clothing person ReID datasets demonstrate that the
proposed IGCL significantly outperforms SOTA methods and that the extracted
feature is more robust, discriminative, and clothing-irrelevant.

recommending per-query hints but it suffers from two inherited problems. First,
it follows the regression framework to predict the absolute latency of each
query plan, which is very challenging because the latencies of query plans for
a certain query may span multiple orders of magnitude. Second, it requires
training a model for each dataset, which restricts the application of the
trained models in practice. In this paper, we propose COOOL to predict Cost

estimating absolute costs, COOOL uses ranking-based approaches to compute
relative ranking scores of the costs of query plans. We show that COOOL is

learning. It aims to continuously learn new classes from data stream and the
samples of data stream are seen only once, which suffers from the catastrophic
forgetting issue, i.e., forgetting historical knowledge of old classes.
Existing replay-based methods effectively alleviate this issue by saving and
replaying part of old data in a proxy-based or contrastive-based replay manner.
Although these two replay manners are effective, the former would incline to
new classes due to class imbalance issues, and the latter is unstable and hard
to converge because of the limited number of samples. In this paper, we conduct
a comprehensive analysis of these two replay manners and find that they can be
complementary. Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel replay-based method
called proxy-based contrastive replay (PCR). The key operation is to replace
the contrastive samples of anchors with corresponding proxies in the
contrastive-based way. It alleviates the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting
by effectively addressing the imbalance issue, as well as keeps a faster
convergence of the model. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world
benchmark datasets, and empirical results consistently demonstrate the
superiority of PCR over various state-of-the-art methods.

equations is very sensitive to the mesh structure, space conformity and
solution regularity. Roughly speaking, for almost all the methods in the
literature, optimal convergence for low-regularity solutions heavily relies on
conforming spaces and highly-regular simplicial meshes. This can be a
significant limitation for many popular methods based on polytopal meshes in
the case of inhomogeneous media, as the discontinuity of electromagnetic
parameters can lead to quite low regularity of solutions near media interfaces,
and potentially worsened by geometric singularities, making many popular
methods based on broken spaces, non-conforming or polytopal meshes particularly
challenging to apply. In this article, we present a virtual element method for
solving an indefinite time-harmonic Maxwell equation in 2D inhomogeneous media
with quite arbitrary polytopal meshes, and the media interface is allowed to
have geometric singularity to cause low regularity. There are two key
novelties: (i) the proposed method is theoretically guaranteed to achieve
robust optimal convergence for solutions with merely $\mathbf{H}^{\theta}$
regularity, $\theta\in(1/2,1]$; (ii) the polytopal element shape can be highly
anisotropic and shrinking, and an explicit formula is established to describe
the relationship between the shape regularity and solution regularity.
Extensive numerical experiments will be given to demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method.

temporal difference for efficient and robust temporal compensation. To fully
utilize the temporal information within frames, we separately modeled the
short-term and long-term temporal discrepancy since they provide distinctive
complementary properties. Specifically, a short-term temporal difference module
is designed to extract local motion representations from residual maps between
adjacent frames, which provides more clues for accurate texture representation.
Meanwhile, the global dependency in the entire frame sequence is explored via
long-term difference learning. The differences between forward and backward
segments are incorporated and activated to modulate the temporal feature,
resulting in holistic global compensation. Besides, we further proposed a
difference compensation unit to enrich the interaction between the spatial
distribution of the target frame and compensated results, which helps maintain
spatial consistency while refining the features to avoid misalignment.
Extensive objective and subjective evaluation of five mainstream satellite
videos demonstrates that the proposed method performs favorably for satellite
VSR. Code will be available at \url{https://github.com/XY-boy/TDMVSR}

  Segmentation","14 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Medical image segmentation is a challenging task with inherent ambiguity and
high uncertainty, attributed to factors such as unclear tumor boundaries and
multiple plausible annotations. The accuracy and diversity of segmentation
masks are both crucial for providing valuable references to radiologists in
clinical practice. While existing diffusion models have shown strong capacities
in various visual generation tasks, it is still challenging to deal with
discrete masks in segmentation. To achieve accurate and diverse medical image
segmentation masks, we propose a novel conditional Bernoulli Diffusion model
for medical image segmentation (BerDiff). Instead of using the Gaussian noise,
we first propose to use the Bernoulli noise as the diffusion kernel to enhance
the capacity of the diffusion model for binary segmentation tasks, resulting in
more accurate segmentation masks. Second, by leveraging the stochastic nature
of the diffusion model, our BerDiff randomly samples the initial Bernoulli
noise and intermediate latent variables multiple times to produce a range of
diverse segmentation masks, which can highlight salient regions of interest
that can serve as valuable references for radiologists. In addition, our
BerDiff can efficiently sample sub-sequences from the overall trajectory of the
reverse diffusion, thereby speeding up the segmentation process. Extensive
experimental results on two medical image segmentation datasets with different
modalities demonstrate that our BerDiff outperforms other recently published
state-of-the-art methods. Our results suggest diffusion models could serve as a
strong backbone for medical image segmentation.

that a limiting version ${v_a}$ of $v$ is a well-defined monotone decreasing

labeled data is the fundamental problem. How to effectively learn image
features from unlabeled images to improve segmentation accuracy is the main
research direction in this field. Traditional self-training methods can
partially solve the problem of insufficient labeled data by generating pseudo
labels for iterative training. However, noise generated due to the model's
uncertainty during training directly affects the segmentation results.
Therefore, we added sample-level and pixel-level uncertainty to stabilize the
training process based on the self-training framework. Specifically, we saved
several moments of the model during pre-training, and used the difference
between their predictions on unlabeled samples as the sample-level uncertainty
estimate for that sample. Then, we gradually add unlabeled samples from easy to
hard during training. At the same time, we added a decoder with different
upsampling methods to the segmentation network and used the difference between
the outputs of the two decoders as pixel-level uncertainty. In short, we
selectively retrained unlabeled samples and assigned pixel-level uncertainty to
pseudo labels to optimize the self-training process. We compared the
segmentation results of our model with five semi-supervised approaches on the

targets from clutter backgrounds on infrared images. Recently, deep learning
based methods have achieved promising performance on SIRST detection, but at
the cost of a large amount of training data with expensive pixel-level
annotations. To reduce the annotation burden, we propose the first method to
achieve SIRST detection with single-point supervision. The core idea of this
work is to recover the per-pixel mask of each target from the given single
point label by using clustering approaches, which looks simple but is indeed
challenging since targets are always insalient and accompanied with background
clutters. To handle this issue, we introduce randomness to the clustering
process by adding noise to the input images, and then obtain much more reliable
pseudo masks by averaging the clustered results. Thanks to this ""Monte Carlo""
clustering approach, our method can accurately recover pseudo masks and thus
turn arbitrary fully supervised SIRST detection networks into weakly supervised
ones with only single point annotation. Experiments on four datasets
demonstrate that our method can be applied to existing SIRST detection networks
to achieve comparable performance with their fully supervised counterparts,
which reveals that single-point supervision is strong enough for SIRST
detection. Our code will be available at:

that given a query $(u,v)\in V^2$, returns an $f(k)$-approximate shortest $u-v$
path $P$ in $G$ within time $q(k)+O(|P|)$. Here $S(n,k)$, $f(k)$ and $q(k)$ are
arbitrary functions.
  A landmark PRDO due to Thorup and Zwick, with an improvement of Wulff-Nilsen,
has $S(n,k)=O(k\cdot n^{1+\frac{1}{k}})$, $f(k)=2k-1$ and $q(k)=O(\log k)$. The
size of this oracle is $\Omega(n\log n)$ for all $k$. Elkin and Pettie and
Neiman and Shabat devised much sparser PRDOs, but their stretch was
polynomially larger than the optimal $2k-1$. On the other hand, for
non-path-reporting distance oracles, Chechik devised a result with
$S(n,k)=O(n^{1+\frac{1}{k}})$, $f(k)=2k-1$ and $q(k)=O(1)$.
  In this paper we make a dramatic progress in bridging the gap between
path-reporting and non-path-reporting distance oracles. We devise a PRDO with
size $S(n,k)=O(\lceil\frac{k\log\log n}{\log n}\rceil\cdot n^{1+\frac{1}{k}})$,
stretch $f(k)=O(k)$ and query time $q(k)=O(\log\lceil\frac{k\log\log n}{\log

$O(k\cdot\lceil\frac{k\log\log n}{\log n}\rceil)$ and query time
$q(k)=O(\log\lceil\frac{k\log\log n}{\log n}\rceil)$.
  Our results on PRDOs are based on novel constructions of approximate distance
preservers, that we devise in this paper. Specifically, we show that for any
$\epsilon>0$, any $k=1,2,...$, and any graph $G$ and a collection $\mathcal{P}$
of $p$ vertex pairs, there exists a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate preserver with
$O(\gamma(\epsilon,k)\cdot p+n\log k+n^{1+\frac{1}{k}})$ edges, where
$\gamma(\epsilon,k)=(\frac{\log k}{\epsilon})^{O(\log k)}$. These new
preservers are significantly sparser than the previous state-of-the-art
approximate preservers due to Kogan and Parter.

through the resolution preserving regularization term. And the continuity based
on the correlation of the grayscale values in different directions is
introduced to mitigate excessive image sparsity and noise reduction through the
continuity regularization term. The Bregman splitting technique is then used to
solve the resulting optimization problem. Both the numerical simulation study

maintain the smoothness and the sparsity of the motion/residual grids. Based on
ReRF, we design a special FVV codec that achieves three orders of magnitudes
compression rate and provides a companion ReRF player to support online

demonstrate the effectiveness of ReRF for compactly representing dynamic

into the cloud-forming regions of the troposphere; however, the origin of these

oscillations/waves arising from the dynamo region could modulate the heat
transport and hence be ultimately responsible for the variability of the
tropospheric banding. These axisymmetric waves are magnetohydrodynamic waves
influenced by the rapid rotation, which have been detected in Earth's core, and
have been recently suggested to exist in Jupiter by the observation of magnetic
secular variations by Juno. Using the magnetic field model JRM33, together with
the density distribution model, we compute the expected speed of these waves.
For the waves excited by variations in the zonal jet flows, their wavelength
can be estimated from the width of the alternating jets, yielding waves with a
half period of 3.2-4.7 years in 14-23$^\circ$N, consistent with the intervals
with the cycles of variability of Jupiter's North Equatorial Belt and North
Temperate Belt identified in the visible and infrared observations. The nature
of these waves, including the wave speed and the wavelength, is revealed by a

One major challenge is that the light-weight student network has difficulty

the significant number of identities in face recognition. Therefore, we seek to
probe the target logits to extract the primary knowledge related to face
identity, and discard the others, to make the distillation more achievable for
the student network. Specifically, there is a tail group with near-zero values
in the prediction, containing minor knowledge for distillation. To provide a
clear perspective of its impact, we first partition the logits into two groups,
i.e., Primary Group and Secondary Group, according to the cumulative
probability of the softened prediction. Then, we reorganize the Knowledge
Distillation (KD) loss of grouped logits into three parts, i.e., Primary-KD,
Secondary-KD, and Binary-KD. Primary-KD refers to distilling the primary
knowledge from the teacher, Secondary-KD aims to refine minor knowledge but
increases the difficulty of distillation, and Binary-KD ensures the consistency
of knowledge distribution between teacher and student. We experimentally found
that (1) Primary-KD and Binary-KD are indispensable for KD, and (2)
Secondary-KD is the culprit restricting KD at the bottleneck. Therefore, we

Our hybrid method can deal with such motions and maintain the exposure

applies optical flow for a coarse registration, which performs well with
complex non-rigid motion but produces deformations at regions with missing
correspondences. The absence of correspondences is due to the occlusions of
scene parallax or the moving contents. To correct such error registration, we
segment images into superpixels and identify problematic alignments based on
each superpixel, which is further aligned by PatchMatch. The method combines
the efficiency of optical flow and the accuracy of PatchMatch. After PatchMatch

  Framework for Electronic Health Record Analysis","10 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electronic Health Records (EHR) are generated from clinical routine care
recording valuable information of broad patient populations, which provide
plentiful opportunities for improving patient management and intervention
strategies in clinical practice. To exploit the enormous potential of EHR data,
a popular EHR data analysis paradigm in machine learning is EHR representation
learning, which first leverages the individual patient's EHR data to learn
informative representations by a backbone, and supports diverse health-care
downstream tasks grounded on the representations. Unfortunately, such a
paradigm fails to access the in-depth analysis of patients' relevance, which is
generally known as cohort studies in clinical practice. Specifically, patients
in the same cohort tend to share similar characteristics, implying their
resemblance in medical conditions such as symptoms or diseases. In this paper,
we propose a universal COhort Representation lEarning (CORE) framework to
augment EHR utilization by leveraging the fine-grained cohort information among
patients. In particular, CORE first develops an explicit patient modeling task
based on the prior knowledge of patients' diagnosis codes, which measures the
latent relevance among patients to adaptively divide the cohorts for each
patient. Based on the constructed cohorts, CORE recodes the pre-extracted EHR
data representation from intra- and inter-cohort perspectives, yielding

geometry is subtler and its deformation space gets smaller (""partially frozen""
singularities). The paper analyzes the physical interpretation of the
Hwang-Oguiso invariant in the context of 4d N=2 QFT and describes the
surprising phenomena which appear when it does not coincide with the monodromy

the partially frozen singularities in M-theory compactified on a local elliptic

small bodies, composed of amorphous water ice, dust, and ices of other volatile
species that are commonly observed in comets. The heat sources are solar
radiation and the decay of short-lived radionuclides. The bodies are highly
porous and gases released in the interior flow through the porous medium. The
most volatile ices, CO and CH$_4$ , are found to be depleted down to the center
over a time scale on the order of 100 Myr. Sublimation fronts advance from the
surface inward, and when the temperature in the inner part rises sufficiently,
bulk sublimation throughout the interior reduces gradually the volatile ices
content until they are completely lost. All the other ices survive, which is
compatible with data collected by New Horizons on Arrokoth, showing the
presence of methanol, and possibly, H$_2$O, CO$_2$, NH$_3$ and C$_2$H$_6$, but
no hypervolatiles. The effect of short-lived radionuclides is to increase the
sublimation equilibrium temperatures and reduce volatile depletion times. We
consider the effect of the bulk density, abundance ratios and heliocentric
distance. At 100~au, CO is depleted, but CH$_4$ survives to present time,
except for a thin outer layer. Since CO is abundantly detected in comets, we
conclude that the source of highly volatile species in active comets must be
gas trapped in amorphous ice.

distribution shift problem that lies between the training and test data. Recent
studies suggest that test-time training (TTT), which adapts the learned model
with test data, might be a promising solution to the problem. Generally, a TTT
strategy hinges its performance on two main factors: selecting an appropriate
auxiliary TTT task for updating and identifying reliable parameters to update
during the test phase. Both previous arts and our experiments indicate that TTT
may not improve but be detrimental to the learned model if those two factors
are not properly considered. This work addresses those two factors by proposing
an Improved Test-Time Adaptation (ITTA) method. First, instead of heuristically
defining an auxiliary objective, we propose a learnable consistency loss for
the TTT task, which contains learnable parameters that can be adjusted toward
better alignment between our TTT task and the main prediction task. Second, we
introduce additional adaptive parameters for the trained model, and we suggest
only updating the adaptive parameters during the test phase. Through extensive

the current state-of-the-art methods on several DG benchmarks. Code is

techniques, such as human-robot collaboration. Current works simplify the task
of predicting human motions into a one-off process of forecasting a short
future sequence (usually no longer than 1 second) based on a historical
observed one. However, such simplification may fail to meet practical needs due
to the neglect of the fact that motion prediction in real applications is not
an isolated ``observe then predict'' unit, but a consecutive process composed
of many rounds of such unit, semi-overlapped along the entire sequence. As time
goes on, the predicted part of previous round has its corresponding ground
truth observable in the new round, but their deviation in-between is neither
exploited nor able to be captured by existing isolated learning fashion. In
this paper, we propose DeFeeNet, a simple yet effective network that can be
added on existing one-off prediction models to realize deviation perception and
feedback when applied to consecutive motion prediction task. At each prediction
round, the deviation generated by previous unit is first encoded by our
DeFeeNet, and then incorporated into the existing predictor to enable a
deviation-aware prediction manner, which, for the first time, allows for
information transmit across adjacent prediction units. We design two versions

This approach enables ambiguous class definitions and interactions between

fool a model into false or absurd classifications. Previous studies addressed
these attacks by fine-tuning the model or changing its architecture. However,
these methods risk losing the original model's performance and are difficult to
apply to downstream tasks. In particular, their applicability to other tasks
has not been considered. In this study, we addressed the reduction of the
impact of typographic attacks on CLIP without changing the model parameters. To
achieve this, we expand the idea of ``prefix learning'' and introduce our
simple yet effective method: Defense-Prefix (DP), which inserts the DP token
before a class name to make words ``robust'' against typographic attacks. Our
method can be easily applied to downstream tasks, such as object detection,
because the proposed method is independent of the model parameters. Our method
significantly improves the accuracy of classification tasks for typographic
attack datasets, while maintaining the zero-shot capabilities of the model. In
addition, we leverage our proposed method for object detection, demonstrating
its high applicability and effectiveness. The codes and datasets will be
publicly available.

that incorporates large-scale image-text pairs to achieve open-vocabulary
object detection (OVD). Unlike previous OVD frameworks that typically rely on a
pre-trained vision-language model (e.g., CLIP) or exploit image-text pairs via
a pseudo labeling process, DetCLIPv2 directly learns the fine-grained
word-region alignment from massive image-text pairs in an end-to-end manner. To
accomplish this, we employ a maximum word-region similarity between region
proposals and textual words to guide the contrastive objective. To enable the
model to gain localization capability while learning broad concepts, DetCLIPv2
is trained with a hybrid supervision from detection, grounding and image-text
pair data under a unified data formulation. By jointly training with an
alternating scheme and adopting low-resolution input for image-text pairs,
DetCLIPv2 exploits image-text pair data efficiently and effectively: DetCLIPv2
utilizes 13X more image-text pairs than DetCLIP with a similar training time
and improves performance. With 13M image-text pairs for pre-training, DetCLIPv2
demonstrates superior open-vocabulary detection performance, e.g., DetCLIPv2
with Swin-T backbone achieves 40.4% zero-shot AP on the LVIS benchmark, which
outperforms previous works GLIP/GLIPv2/DetCLIP by 14.4/11.4/4.5% AP,
respectively, and even beats its fully-supervised counterpart by a large
margin.

existing SSOD approaches mainly focus on horizontal objects, leaving
multi-oriented objects that are common in aerial images unexplored. This paper
proposes a novel Semi-supervised Oriented Object Detection model, termed SOOD,
built upon the mainstream pseudo-labeling framework. Towards oriented objects
in aerial scenes, we design two loss functions to provide better supervision.
Focusing on the orientations of objects, the first loss regularizes the
consistency between each pseudo-label-prediction pair (includes a prediction
and its corresponding pseudo label) with adaptive weights based on their
orientation gap. Focusing on the layout of an image, the second loss
regularizes the similarity and explicitly builds the many-to-many relation
between the sets of pseudo-labels and predictions. Such a global consistency
constraint can further boost semi-supervised learning. Our experiments show
that when trained with the two proposed losses, SOOD surpasses the
state-of-the-art SSOD methods under various settings on the DOTA-v1.5

essential to reduce storage requirements, but also to reduce the bandwidth and
latency requirements for transmission. In particular, the use of compressed
images allows for faster transfer of data, and faster response times for visual
recognition in edge devices that rely on cloud-based services. In this paper,
we first analyze the impact of image compression using traditional codecs, as
well as recent state-of-the-art neural compression approaches, on three visual
recognition tasks: image classification, object detection, and semantic
segmentation. We consider a wide range of compression levels, ranging from 0.1
to 2 bits-per-pixel (bpp). We find that for all three tasks, the recognition
ability is significantly impacted when using strong compression. For example,
for segmentation mIoU is reduced from 44.5 to 30.5 mIoU when compressing to 0.1
bpp using the best compression model we evaluated. Second, we test to what
extent this performance drop can be ascribed to a loss of relevant information
in the compressed image, or to a lack of generalization of visual recognition
models to images with compression artefacts. We find that to a large extent the
performance loss is due to the latter: by finetuning the recognition models on
compressed training images, most of the performance loss is recovered. For
example, bringing segmentation accuracy back up to 42 mIoU, i.e. recovering 82%
of the original drop in accuracy.

obtained from the Laplace equation. We use this potential in the approximation
formula form to construct magnetic energy of the sample in terms of the
pairwise interactions of the particles. We show that this form of magnetic

particles arrangement on the magnetostriction effect. We consider different
spatial distributions of the magnetic particles: a uniform one, as well as
several lattice-type distributions (SC, BCC, HCP and FCC arrangements). We show
that the particles arrangement affects significantly the magnetostriction
effect if the separation between them became comparable with the particles'
dimensions. We also show that, typically, this contribution to the
magnetostriction effect is of the opposite sign to the one related with the
initial elastomer shape. Finally, we calculate the magnetostriction effect
using the same interaction potential but expressed in a form of a series
expansion, qualitatively confirming the above findings.

object-in-hand pose datasets use two-finger grippers and also assume that the
object remains fixed in the hand without any relative movements, which is not

object-in-hand pose dataset is proposed using a teleoperation method with an
anthropomorphic Shadow Dexterous hand. Our dataset comprises RGB-D images,
proprioception and tactile data, covering diverse grasping poses, finger
contact states, and object occlusions. To overcome the significant hand
occlusion and limited tactile sensor contact in real-world scenarios, we
propose PoseFusion, a hybrid multi-modal fusion approach that integrates the
information from visual and tactile perception channels. PoseFusion generates
three candidate object poses from three estimators (tactile only, visual only,
and visuo-tactile fusion), which are then filtered by a SelectLSTM network to
select the optimal pose, avoiding inferior fusion poses resulting from modality
collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness and advantages of
our framework. All data and codes are available on the project website:

performance as a measure of information freshness. Unlike the conventional age
of information (AoI) metric, the instantaneous AoC decreases only when all
cooperative packets for a common observation are successfully received. Hence,
effectively allocating wireless time-frequency resources among IoT devices to
achieve a low average AoC at the central receiver is paramount. Three multiple
access schemes are considered in this paper: time-division multiple access
(TDMA) without retransmission, TDMA with retransmission, and frequency-division
multiple access (FDMA). First, our theoretical analysis indicates that TDMA
with retransmission outperforms the other two schemes in terms of average AoC.
Subsequently, we implement information update systems based on the three

considering the medium access control (MAC) overhead in practice, FDMA achieves
a lower average AoC than TDMA with or without retransmission in the high

because of seeing too many similar recommendations. In this paper, we propose
Fatigue-Aware Network (FAN), a novel CTR model that directly perceives user
fatigue from non-clicks. Specifically, we first apply Fourier Transformation to
the time series generated from non-clicks, obtaining its frequency spectrum
which contains comprehensive information about user fatigue. Then the frequency
spectrum is modulated by category information of the target item to model the
bias that both the upper bound of fatigue and users' patience is different for
different categories. Moreover, a gating network is adopted to model the
confidence of user fatigue and an auxiliary task is designed to guide the
learning of user fatigue, so we can obtain a well-learned fatigue

uncertainty of user behaviors and alleviate exposure bias. However, existing
generative models still suffer from the posterior collapse problem or the model
collapse problem, thus limiting their applications in sequential
recommendation. To tackle the challenges mentioned above, we leverage a new
paradigm of the generative models, i.e., diffusion models, and present
sequential recommendation with diffusion models (DiffRec), which can avoid the
issues of VAE- and GAN-based models and show better performance. While
diffusion models are originally proposed to process continuous image data, we
design an additional transition in the forward process together with a
transition in the reverse process to enable the processing of the discrete
recommendation data. We also design a different noising strategy that only
noises the target item instead of the whole sequence, which is more suitable
for sequential recommendation. Based on the modified diffusion process, we
derive the objective function of our framework using a simplification technique
and design a denoise sequential recommender to fulfill the objective function.
As the lengthened diffusion steps substantially increase the time complexity,
we propose an efficient training strategy and an efficient inference strategy
to reduce training and inference cost and improve recommendation diversity.
Extensive experiment results on three public benchmark datasets verify the
effectiveness of our approach and show that DiffRec outperforms the
state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models.

that has attracted considerable research attention in recent years. A canonical
approach to this problem is to use synthetic data. That is, we replace the
input database R with a synthetic database R* that preserves the
characteristics of R, and use R* to answer queries. Existing solutions for
relational data synthesis, however, either fail to provide strong privacy
protection, or assume that R contains a single relation. In addition, it is
challenging to extend the existing single-relation solutions to the case of
multiple relations, because they are unable to model the complex correlations
induced by the foreign keys. Therefore, multi-relational data synthesis with
strong privacy guarantees is an open problem. In this paper, we address the
above open problem by proposing PrivLava, the first solution for synthesizing
relational data with foreign keys under differential privacy, a rigorous
privacy framework widely adopted in both academia and industry. The key idea of
PrivLava is to model the data distribution in R using graphical models, with
latent variables included to capture the inter-relational correlations caused
by foreign keys. We show that PrivLava supports arbitrary foreign key
references that form a directed acyclic graph, and is able to tackle the common
case when R contains a mixture of public and private relations. Extensive
experiments on census data sets and the TPC-H benchmark demonstrate that
PrivLava significantly outperforms its competitors in terms of the accuracy of
aggregate queries processed on the synthetic data.

measure the quality of this preconditioner in terms of its relative
excentricity to the unknown Hessian matrix, and we generalize these techniques
to convex functions with a slowly-changing Hessian. We combine this with an
interior point method to show that, given first-order access to an appropriate

optimization problems over $K$ to $\varepsilon$ precision in time
$\widetilde{O}\left(\left(\mathcal{T}+n^{2}\right)\sqrt{n\nu}\log\left(1/\varepsilon\right)\right)$,

measured by a set of tidal Love and dissipation numbers imprinted in the

General Relativity has vanishing Love numbers, a black hole in alternative
theories of gravity can acquire non-vanishing Love numbers. The dissipation
numbers may quantify Planckian corrections at the horizon scale. These
properties will allow a test of classical theories of gravity in the
strong-field regime with gravitational-wave observation. Since black holes are
not in the exact vacuum environment in astrophysical situations, the following
question arises: can the environment affect the tidal response? In this paper,
we investigate the stability of the tidal response of a Schwarzschild black
hole for frequency-dependent tidal-field perturbations against a small
modification of the background. Our analysis relies on the scattering theory,
which overcomes difficulties in defining the relativistic tidal Love numbers.
The tidal Love and dissipation numbers can be extracted from the phase shift of
sufficiently low-frequency scattering waves. We show that the tidal Love
numbers are sensitive to the property of the modification. Therefore, we need
careful consideration of the environment around the black hole in assessing the
deviation of the underlying theory of gravity from General Relativity with the
Love numbers. The modification has less impact on the dissipation numbers,
indicating that quantifying the existence of the event horizon with them is not
spoiled. We also demonstrate that in a composite system, i.e., a compact object
with environmental effects, the Love and dissipation numbers are approximately
determined by the sum of the numbers of each component.

compute the complex multiplication field and type of Jacobian varieties arising
from these covers, applying the representation theory of $G$ over $\mathbb{Q}$
and $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_4)$. We also apply the Shimura-Taniyama formula to
compute the Newton polygons of these Jacobians. We classify all the $G$-Galois
covers for nonabelian faithful metacyclic groups $G$ and dicyclic groups $G$,
identifying those that have complex multiplication.

i.e., it estimates the conditional probability of the outcome given a feature
vector. In general, a predictive model cannot estimate the causal effect of a
feature on the outcome, i.e., how the outcome will change if the feature is
changed while keeping the values of other features unchanged. This is because
causal effect estimation requires interventional probabilities. However, many
real world problems such as personalised decision making, recommendation, and
fairness computing, need to know the causal effect of any feature on the
outcome for a given instance. This is different from the traditional causal
effect estimation problem with a fixed treatment variable. This paper first
tackles the challenge of estimating the causal effect of any feature (as the
treatment) on the outcome w.r.t. a given instance. The theoretical results
naturally link a predictive model to causal effect estimations and imply that a
predictive model is causally interpretable when the conditions identified in
the paper are satisfied. The paper also reveals the robust property of a
causally interpretable model. We use experiments to demonstrate that various
types of predictive models, when satisfying the conditions identified in this

state-of-the-art causal effect estimation methods. We also show the potential
of such causally interpretable predictive models for robust predictions and

magnetic field direction around Geminga is closely aligned with the line of
sight toward it. However, this direction should not extend further than the
correlation length of the turbulent magnetic field $L_c$, which could be $100$

asymmetry predicted by this scenario is mainly contributed by the electrons

pc. Then, considering the directional variation of the magnetic field beyond
the core section, we take one magnetic field configuration as an example to
investigate the possible halo morphology. The predicted morphology has some
different features compared to the $L_c=\infty$ scenario. The current
experiments may already be able to test these features. In addition, we use a

difficulties mainly comes from the domain shift issue, i.e., the fundus images
collected at these centers usually vary greatly in the tone, contrast, and
brightness. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method called Reconstruction-driven
Dynamic Refinement Network (RDR-Net), where we employ a due-path segmentation
backbone for simultaneous edge detection and region prediction and design three
modules to alleviate the domain gap. The reconstruction alignment (RA) module
uses a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to reconstruct the input image and thus
boosts the image representation ability of the network in a self-supervised
way. It also uses a style-consistency constraint to force the network to retain
more domain-invariant information. The low-level feature refinement (LFR)
module employs input-specific dynamic convolutions to suppress the
domain-variant information in the obtained low-level features. The
prediction-map alignment (PMA) module elaborates the entropy-driven adversarial
learning to encourage the network to generate source-like boundaries and
regions. We evaluated our RDR-Net against state-of-the-art solutions on four

even parity Resonant Magnetic Perturbations (RMPs) has been significantly
expanded to a range from 3.9 to 4.8, which is demonstrated to be reliable and
repeatable in EAST over the last two years. This window is significantly wider
than the previous one, which is around q95=3.7pm0.1, and is achieved using n=4
odd parity RMPs. Here, n represents the toroidal mode number of the applied
RMPs and q95 is the safety factor at the 95% normalized poloidal magnetic flux.
During ELM suppression, there is only a slight drop in the stored energy
(<=10%). The comparison of pedestal density profiles suggests that ELM
suppression is achieved when the pedestal gradient is kept lower than a
threshold. This wide q95 window for ELM suppression is consistent with the
prediction made by MARS-F modeling prior to the experiment, in which it is
located at one of the resonant q95 windows for plasma response. The Chirikov
parameter taking into account plasma response near the pedestal top, which
measures the plasma edge stochasticity, significantly increases when q95
exceeds 4, mainly due to denser neighboring rational surfaces. Modeling of
plasma response by the MARS-F code shows a strong coupling between resonant and
non-resonant components across the pedestal region, which is characteristic of
the kink-peeling like response observed during RMP-ELM suppression in previous
studies on EAST. These promising results show the reliability of ELM
suppression using the n=4 RMPs and expand the physical understanding on ELM
suppression mechanism.

Previous studies on droplets show that the molecules are arranged

of pores with attractive substrates that favour homeotropic anchoring, the
formation of nanobridges characterised by anchoring angles that decrease with
increasing particle-substrate interaction intensity is observed. When the
orientational field in the nanobridge is analysed, the formation of an annular
disclination of topological charge $+1/2$ located in the plane perpendicular to
the $z$-axis that passes through the centre of mass of the nanobridge is
observed for small $D$. However, when considering higher values of $D$, a
change to a biaxial orientational profile within the nanobridge is observed,
where now the annular disclination is arranged in a plane perpendicular to one
direction of the $xy$ plane. These results are indicative of the existence of
an orientational phase transition for an intermediate $D$ value between a
uniaxial and a biaxial orientational configuration in the capillary nanobridge.

  Hybrid Convolution",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Since the number of incident energies is limited, it is difficult to directly
acquire hyperspectral images (HSI) with high spatial resolution. Considering
the high dimensionality and correlation of HSI, super-resolution (SR) of HSI
remains a challenge in the absence of auxiliary high-resolution images.
Furthermore, it is very important to extract the spatial features effectively
and make full use of the spectral information. This paper proposes a novel HSI
super-resolution algorithm, termed dual-domain network based on hybrid
convolution (SRDNet). Specifically, a dual-domain network is designed to fully
exploit the spatial-spectral and frequency information among the hyper-spectral
data. To capture inter-spectral self-similarity, a self-attention learning
mechanism (HSL) is devised in the spatial domain. Meanwhile the pyramid
structure is applied to increase the acceptance field of attention, which
further reinforces the feature representation ability of the network. Moreover,
to further improve the perceptual quality of HSI, a frequency loss(HFL) is
introduced to optimize the model in the frequency domain. The dynamic weighting
mechanism drives the network to gradually refine the generated frequency and
excessive smoothing caused by spatial loss. Finally, In order to better fully
obtain the mapping relationship between high-resolution space and
low-resolution space, a hybrid module of 2D and 3D units with progressive
upsampling strategy is utilized in our method. Experiments on a widely used
benchmark dataset illustrate that the proposed SRDNet method enhances the
texture information of HSI and is superior to state-of-the-art methods.

especially in biomedical literature search engines where queries are generally
short and top documents account for most of the total clicks. Motivated by
this, we present a novel architecture for biomedical literature search, namely
Log-Augmented DEnse Retrieval (LADER), which is a simple plug-in module that
augments a dense retriever with the click logs retrieved from similar training
queries. Specifically, LADER finds both similar documents and queries to the
given query by a dense retriever. Then, LADER scores relevant (clicked)
documents of similar queries weighted by their similarity to the input query.
The final document scores by LADER are the average of (1) the document
similarity scores from the dense retriever and (2) the aggregated document
scores from the click logs of similar queries. Despite its simplicity, LADER
achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on TripClick, a recently
released benchmark for biomedical literature retrieval. On the frequent (HEAD)
queries, LADER largely outperforms the best retrieval model by 39% relative
NDCG@10 (0.338 v.s. 0.243). LADER also achieves better performance on the less
frequent (TORSO) queries with 11% relative NDCG@10 improvement over the
previous SOTA (0.303 v.s. 0.272). On the rare (TAIL) queries where similar
queries are scarce, LADER still compares favorably to the previous SOTA method
(NDCG@10: 0.310 v.s. 0.295). On all queries, LADER can improve the performance
of a dense retriever by 24%-37% relative NDCG@10 while not requiring additional
training, and further performance improvement is expected from more logs. Our
regression analysis has shown that queries that are more frequent, have higher
entropy of query similarity and lower entropy of document similarity, tend to
benefit more from log augmentation.

pre-trained vision models for motor control. While existing works mainly
emphasize the importance of this pre-training phase, the arguably equally
important role played by downstream policy learning during control-specific
fine-tuning is often neglected. It thus remains unclear if pre-trained vision
models are consistent in their effectiveness under different control policies.
To bridge this gap in understanding, we conduct a comprehensive study on 14
pre-trained vision models using 3 distinct classes of policy learning methods,
including reinforcement learning (RL), imitation learning through behavior
cloning (BC), and imitation learning with a visual reward function (VRF). Our
study yields a series of intriguing results, including the discovery that the
effectiveness of pre-training is highly dependent on the choice of the
downstream policy learning algorithm. We show that conventionally accepted
evaluation based on RL methods is highly variable and therefore unreliable, and
further advocate for using more robust methods like VRF and BC. To facilitate
more universal evaluations of pre-trained models and their policy learning
methods in the future, we also release a benchmark of 21 tasks across 3
different environments alongside our work.

spatial frequency domain. Two types of rotational scanning are possible:
tomographic and laminographic. For flat, extended samples, for which the full
180 degree coverage is not possible, the latter is preferable because it
provides better coverage of the 3D spatial frequency domain compared to

techniques are time consuming because of extensive acquisition and computation
time. Here, we demonstrate the acceleration of ptycho-laminographic

decreasing the capability of learning other discriminative features; 2)
fixed-size filters trained on images at a given scale fail to generalize to

via multiple pathways, while its self-propulsion created kinetic energy
fluctuation. Here, we seek mechanistic explanations for these observations by
adopting a physics-based approach that integrates biological and robotic
studies.
  We discovered that animal and robot locomotor transitions during beam
obstacle traversal and ground self-righting are barrier-crossing transitions on
potential energy landscapes. Whereas animals and robot traversed stiff beams by
rolling their body betweenbeam, they pushed across flimsy beams, suggesting a
concept of terradynamic favorability where modes with easier physical
interaction are more likely to occur. Robotic beam traversal revealed that,
system state either remains in a favorable mode or transitions to one when
energy fluctuation is comparable to the transition barrier. Robotic
self-righting transitions occurred similarly and revealed that changing system
parameters lowers barriers over which comparable fluctuation can induce
transitions. Thetransitionsof animalsin both systems mostly occurred similarly,
but sensory feedback may facilitate its beam traversal. Finally, we developed a
method to measure animal movement across large spatiotemporal scales in a
terrain treadmill.

patch information under different receptive fields. The heterogeneous Swin
Transformer (HST) is the core module, which achieves the interaction of
multi-receptive field patch information through heterogeneous attention and
passes it to the next stage for progressive learning. We also designed a

attention via decentralized training on local clients. However, most FSS models
assume categories are fixed in advance, thus heavily undergoing forgetting on
old categories in practical applications where local clients receive new
categories incrementally while have no memory storage to access old classes.
Moreover, new clients collecting novel classes may join in the global training
of FSS, which further exacerbates catastrophic forgetting. To surmount the
above challenges, we propose a Forgetting-Balanced Learning (FBL) model to
address heterogeneous forgetting on old classes from both intra-client and
inter-client aspects. Specifically, under the guidance of pseudo labels
generated via adaptive class-balanced pseudo labeling, we develop a
forgetting-balanced semantic compensation loss and a forgetting-balanced
relation consistency loss to rectify intra-client heterogeneous forgetting of
old categories with background shift. It performs balanced gradient propagation
and relation consistency distillation within local clients. Moreover, to tackle
heterogeneous forgetting from inter-client aspect, we propose a task transition
monitor. It can identify new classes under privacy protection and store the
latest old global model for relation distillation. Qualitative experiments
reveal large improvement of our model against comparison methods. The code is

in neural implicit representation has brought new opportunities to robotic
mapping. In this paper, we propose the multi-volume neural feature fields,
called NF-Atlas, which bridge the neural feature volumes with pose graph
optimization. By regarding the neural feature volume as pose graph nodes and
the relative pose between volumes as pose graph edges, the entire neural
feature field becomes both locally rigid and globally elastic. Locally, the
neural feature volume employs a sparse feature Octree and a small MLP to encode
the submap SDF with an option of semantics. Learning the map using this
structure allows for end-to-end solving of maximum a posteriori (MAP) based
probabilistic mapping. Globally, the map is built volume by volume
independently, avoiding catastrophic forgetting when mapping incrementally.
Furthermore, when a loop closure occurs, with the elastic pose graph based
representation, only updating the origin of neural volumes is required without
remapping. Finally, these functionalities of NF-Atlas are validated. Thanks to
the sparsity and the optimization based formulation, NF-Atlas shows competitive
performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency and memory usage on both
simulation and real-world datasets.

from issues such as being unable to guarantee the completion of the attack

propose a reinforcement learning-based black-box model inversion attack. We
formulate the latent space search as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem

private data can be reconstructed using the latent vectors found by the agent
trained in the MDP. The experiment results on various datasets and models

major challenge for numerical weather prediction, especially for subtropical

heterogeneity, specifically mesoscale gradients in SM and land surface
temperature (LST), affect convective initiation (CI) over South America? Using
satellite data, we track nascent, daytime convective clouds and quantify the
underlying antecedent (morning) surface heterogeneity. We find that convection
initiates preferentially on the dry side of strong SM/LST boundaries with
spatial scales of tens of kilometers. The strongest alongwind gradients in LST
anomalies at 30 km length scale underlying the CI location occur during weak
background low-level wind (<2.5m/s), high convective available potential energy
(>1500J/kg) and low convective inhibition (<250J/kg) over sparse vegetation. At
100 km scale, strong gradients occur at the CI location during convectively
unfavorable conditions and strong background flow. The location of PPT is
strongly sensitive to the strength of the background flow. The wind profile
during weak background flow inhibits propagation of convection away from the
dry regions leading to negative SM-PPT feedback whereas strong background flow
is related to longer lifecycle and rainfall hundreds of kilometers away from
the CI location. Thus, the sign of the SM-PPT feedback is dependent on the
background flow. This work presents the first observational evidence that CI
over subtropical South America is associated with dry soil patches on the order
of tens of kilometers. Convection-permitting numerical weather prediction
models need to be examined for accurately capturing the effect of SM
heterogeneity in initiating convection over such semi-arid regions.

synchronized oscillations in biological systems, with its temporal
synchronization properties well studied. However, the properties of spatial
waves have received less attention. This paper investigates the spatial waves
formed by locally coupled oscillators arranged in an $n\times n$ grid.
Numerical simulations show that directional waves can form when the system
exhibits heterogeneity, while spiral waves can arise in a homogeneous system.
Interestingly, both wave patterns remain stable under minor noise disturbances.
To explain the properties of the spatial wave pattern, starting from the
simplest case of a $2\times 2$ grid, we analytically calculate the phase
differences between oscillators to discuss the formation of wave patterns in
the system. We then apply this method to compute the stable and saddle points
and corresponding wave patterns of some $n\times n$ grid cases and discuss
their stability. Furthermore, linear approximation reveals that the wave
pattern under noise is the noiseless wave pattern plus its first-order
approximation, indicating that the wave pattern remains stable within a certain
range of noise. These results suggest that the necessary condition for
directional wave propagation in biological systems is the presence of
heterogeneity that far exceeds noise. In contrast, the disappearance of
heterogeneity may induce spiral waves, often corresponding to disease states.

and redox activity to these polymers, which are generally seen as beneficial to
cell performance. Alternatively, it is also possible that the addition of
charge-transferring centers to the electrode can accelerate cell degradation.
Here, we use an aromatic polyimide (~320 mAh/g of reversible capacity) to
explore how a redox-active conductive polymer can affect cell performance. We
demonstrate that the lithiated polymer is less stable than the traditional
binders upon storage, leading to increased rates of calendar aging.
Furthermore, we show that the adhesion properties of the polymer deteriorate
upon repeated cycling, to an extent that is proportional to the degree of
delithiation of the binder. More critically, we show that progressive
degradation of the redox behavior of the polymer leads to the release of extra
Li+ into the cell, which can give the false perception of good performance even

computing efficiency and capabilities by following brain-inspired principles.
However, the rich diversity of techniques employed in neuromorphic research has
resulted in a lack of clear standards for benchmarking, hindering effective
evaluation of the advantages and strengths of neuromorphic methods compared to
traditional deep-learning-based methods. This paper presents a collaborative
effort, bringing together members from academia and the industry, to define
benchmarks for neuromorphic computing: NeuroBench. The goals of NeuroBench are
to be a collaborative, fair, and representative benchmark suite developed by
the community, for the community. In this paper, we discuss the challenges
associated with benchmarking neuromorphic solutions, and outline the key
features of NeuroBench. We believe that NeuroBench will be a significant step
towards defining standards that can unify the goals of neuromorphic computing
and drive its technological progress. Please visit neurobench.ai for the latest

utility, and efficiency as its primary pillars. Existing research indicates
that it is unlikely to simultaneously attain infinitesimal privacy leakage,
utility loss, and efficiency. Therefore, how to find an optimal trade-off
solution is the key consideration when designing the FL algorithm. One common
way is to cast the trade-off problem as a multi-objective optimization problem,
i.e., the goal is to minimize the utility loss and efficiency reduction while
constraining the privacy leakage not exceeding a predefined value. However,
existing multi-objective optimization frameworks are very time-consuming, and
do not guarantee the existence of the Pareto frontier, this motivates us to
seek a solution to transform the multi-objective problem into a
single-objective problem because it is more efficient and easier to be solved.
To this end, we propose FedPAC, a unified framework that leverages PAC learning
to quantify multiple objectives in terms of sample complexity, such
quantification allows us to constrain the solution space of multiple objectives
to a shared dimension, so that it can be solved with the help of a
single-objective optimization algorithm. Specifically, we provide the results
and detailed analyses of how to quantify the utility loss, privacy leakage,
privacy-utility-efficiency trade-off, as well as the cost of the attacker from
the PAC learning perspective.

cardiovascular disease (CVD) early identification, and the introduction of
intelligent wearable ECG devices has enabled daily monitoring. However, due to
the need for professional expertise in the ECGs interpretation, general public
access has once again been restricted, prompting the need for the development
of advanced diagnostic algorithms. Classic rule-based algorithms are now
completely outperformed by deep learning based methods. But the advancement of
smart diagnostic algorithms is hampered by issues like small dataset,
inconsistent data labeling, inefficient use of local and global ECG
information, memory and inference time consuming deployment of multiple models,
and lack of information transfer between tasks. We propose a multi-resolution
model that can sustain high-resolution low-level semantic information
throughout, with the help of the development of low-resolution high-level
semantic information, by capitalizing on both local morphological information
and global rhythm information. From the perspective of effective data leverage
and inter-task knowledge transfer, we develop a parameter isolation based ECG
continual learning (ECG-CL) approach. We evaluated our model's performance on
four open-access datasets by designing segmentation-to-classification for
cross-domain incremental learning, minority-to-majority class for category

Our approach is shown to successfully extract informative morphological and

designed to focus on one programming language. However, in real life, programs
are developed using different programming languages depending on their

evaluate GraphBinMatch on several tasks, such as cross-language

also evaluate our approach performance on single-language binary-to-source code

reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can often successfully learn good

Unfortunately, however, it can not be guaranteed that the generated samples

issue, we propose Trajectory Truncation with Uncertainty (TATU), which
adaptively truncates the synthetic trajectory if the accumulated uncertainty
along the trajectory is too large. We theoretically show the performance bound
of TATU to justify its benefits. To empirically show the advantages of TATU, we
first combine it with two classical model-based offline RL algorithms, MOPO and
COMBO. Furthermore, we integrate TATU with several off-the-shelf model-free
offline RL algorithms, e.g., BCQ. Experimental results on the D4RL benchmark
show that TATU significantly improves their performance, often by a large

numerous fields of research such as drug discovery and material science.
Representation learning techniques have recently been employed with the primary
objective of generating compact and informative numerical expressions of
complex data. One approach to efficiently learn molecular representations is
processing string-based notations of chemicals via natural language processing
(NLP) algorithms. Majority of the methods proposed so far utilize SMILES
notations for this purpose; however, SMILES is associated with numerous
problems related to validity and robustness, which may prevent the model from
effectively uncovering the knowledge hidden in the data. In this study, we
propose SELFormer, a transformer architecture-based chemical language model
that utilizes a 100% valid, compact and expressive notation, SELFIES, as input,
in order to learn flexible and high-quality molecular representations.
SELFormer is pre-trained on two million drug-like compounds and fine-tuned for
diverse molecular property prediction tasks. Our performance evaluation has
revealed that, SELFormer outperforms all competing methods, including graph
learning-based approaches and SMILES-based chemical language models, on
predicting aqueous solubility of molecules and adverse drug reactions. We also
visualized molecular representations learned by SELFormer via dimensionality
reduction, which indicated that even the pre-trained model can discriminate
molecules with differing structural properties. We shared SELFormer as a
programmatic tool, together with its datasets and pre-trained models. Overall,
our research demonstrates the benefit of using the SELFIES notations in the
context of chemical language modeling and opens up new possibilities for the
design and discovery of novel drug candidates with desired features.

computers; however, the noise of quantum bits (qubits) is still an obstacle for
real-world applications to leveraging the power of quantum computing. Although
there exist error mitigation or error-aware designs for quantum applications,
the inherent fluctuation of noise (a.k.a., instability) can easily collapse the
performance of error-aware designs. What's worse, users can even not be aware
of the performance degradation caused by the change in noise. To address both
issues, in this paper we use Quantum Neural Network (QNN) as a vehicle to
present a novel compression-aided framework, namely QuCAD, which will adapt a
trained QNN to fluctuating quantum noise. In addition, with the historical
calibration (noise) data, our framework will build a model repository offline,
which will significantly reduce the optimization time in the online adaption
process. Emulation results on an earthquake detection dataset show that QuCAD
can achieve 14.91% accuracy gain on average in 146 days over a noise-aware

two decades, and many results are known regarding its fine-grained complexity.
Despite this, wide gaps remain in our understanding of the time complexity for
several basic variants of the problem. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap
by providing algorithms, conditional lower bounds, and non-reducibility
results. Our main result is that for most problem settings, deterministic
reductions based on the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) cannot rule
out $n^{4-o(1)}$ time algorithms under a hypothesis called NSETH.
  As a step towards ruling out even $mn^{1+\varepsilon-o(1)}$ SETH lower bounds
for undirected graphs with unit node-capacities, we design a new randomized
$O(m^{2+o(1)})$ time combinatorial algorithm. This is an improvement over the
recent $O(m^{11/5+o(1)})$ time algorithm [Huang et al., STOC 2023] and matching
their $m^{2-o(1)}$ lower bound (up to subpolynomial factors), thus essentially
settling the time complexity for this setting of the problem.
  More generally, our main technical contribution is the insight that $st$-cuts
can be verified quickly, and that in most settings, $st$-flows can be shipped
succinctly (i.e., with respect to the flow support). This is a key idea in our
non-reducibility results, and it may be of independent interest.

MRI artifacts as neurodegeneration, impacting their accuracy. In our previous
study, we developed a deep learning method DeepAtrophy that uses a
convolutional neural network to quantify differences between longitudinal MRI
scan pairs that are associated with time. DeepAtrophy has high accuracy in
inferring temporal information from longitudinal MRI scans, such as temporal
order or relative inter-scan interval. DeepAtrophy also provides an overall
atrophy score that was shown to perform well as a potential biomarker of
disease progression and treatment efficacy. However, DeepAtrophy is not
interpretable, and it is unclear what changes in the MRI contribute to
progression measurements. In this paper, we propose Regional Deep Atrophy
(RDA), which combines the temporal inference approach from DeepAtrophy with a
deformable registration neural network and attention mechanism that highlights
regions in the MRI image where longitudinal changes are contributing to
temporal inference. RDA has similar prediction accuracy as DeepAtrophy, but its
additional interpretability makes it more acceptable for use in clinical
settings, and may lead to more sensitive biomarkers for disease monitoring in
clinical trials of early AD.

Indeed, we have measured 70--90 eV RMS for the four devices, which show an

Shanker","A Transient Port-Extraction Technique for Antenna Feed Optimization","4 pages, 7 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optimization of strongly non-linear tightly coupled feeds attached to
antennas is a challenging problem from a purely computational perspective. One
can imagine that an optimization would (a) need to be in the time domain, and
(b) has to be self-consistently coupled with the linear antenna (or
electromagnetic) system. These two imply that the cost of optimization is
governed by the need to repeatedly evaluate the fully coupled cost function.
This paper leverages a recently developed transient port-extraction technique
to circumvent this challenge and is agnostic to the optimization scheme. This
approach provides a representation of the entire linear electromagnetic system
at the port and can readily integrate with any non-linear circuit analysis and
optimization methodology. In this paper, we demonstrate optimization of linear
and non-linear circuit feed parameters that are tightly coupled to broadband
radiating systems.

in south India by over a quarter million people. ""Pulli"" in the Tamil language
means dots. A specific type of pulli kolam is ""sikku"" kolam where a series of
dots are placed using rice flour and lines are drawn around them with three
simple rules: all dots are individually encircled, line crossings are discrete
points, and there are no loose ends in the lines drawn. A topological approach
to viewing a kolam was presented earlier [arXiv:1503.02130] where a kolam could
be broken up into pieces (tiles) of a puzzle and then assembled together
following the above rules. Here we focus on sikku kolams assembled from square
tiles. Kolams are classified by their point group symmetry, and formulae are
derived for counting the number of kolams in each symmetry type. Some
interesting constraint problems are posed that could help formulate new games
based on this elegant artform.

antennas. The unit-cell size of an artificial dielectric determines the maximum
operating frequency and also drives cost and yield. To explore the frequency
limitations we printed four identical Luneburg lens antennas using gyroid
unit-cells of 12.5, 10, 7.5, and 5mm and measured their gain over the K- and
Ka-band. We find maximum frequencies of 20, 25, 33, and >40GHz for each
unit-cell, respectively. These measurements suggest a print resolution limit of
$0.7\lambda_g$, where $\lambda_g$ is the wavelength in the host dielectric.

  hidden variables","23 pages,23 figures",,,,"nlin.AO physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reconstructing the equation of motion and thus the network topology of a
system from time series is a very important problem. Although many powerful
methods have been developed, it remains a great challenge to deal with systems
in high dimensions with partial knowledge of the states. In this paper, we
propose a new framework based on a well-designed cost functional, the
minimization of which transforms the determination of both the unknown
parameters and the unknown state evolution into parameter learning. This method
can be conveniently used to reconstruct structures and dynamics of complex
networks, even in the presence of noisy disturbances or for intricate parameter
dependence. As a demonstration, we successfully apply it to the reconstruction
of different dynamics on complex networks such as coupled Lorenz oscillators,
neuronal networks, phase oscillators and gene regulation, from only a partial
measurement of the node behavior. The simplicity and efficiency of the new
framework makes it a powerful alternative to recover system dynamics even in
high dimensions, which expects diverse applications in real-world
reconstruction.

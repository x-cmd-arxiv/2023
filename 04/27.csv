serving as the final-stage filter to rank items for a user. The key to
addressing the CTR task is learning feature interactions that are useful for
prediction, which is typically achieved by fitting historical click data with
the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) paradigm. Representative methods include
Factorization Machines and Deep Interest Network, which have achieved wide
success in industrial applications. However, such a manner inevitably learns
unstable feature interactions, i.e., the ones that exhibit strong correlations
in historical data but generalize poorly for future serving. In this work, we
reformulate the CTR task -- instead of pursuing ERM on historical data, we
split the historical data chronologically into several periods (a.k.a,
environments), aiming to learn feature interactions that are stable across
periods. Such feature interactions are supposed to generalize better to predict
future behavior data. Nevertheless, a technical challenge is that existing
invariant learning solutions like Invariant Risk Minimization are not
applicable, since the click data entangles both environment-invariant and
environment-specific correlations. To address this dilemma, we propose
Disentangled Invariant Learning (DIL) which disentangles feature embeddings to
capture the two types of correlations separately. To improve the modeling
efficiency, we further design LightDIL which performs the disentanglement at
the higher level of the feature field. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of DIL in learning stable feature interactions for CTR. We
release the code at https://github.com/zyang1580/DIL.

iterative knowledge distillation approach that bridges the gap between the

5.5% and 8.5% improvements in terms of question answering accuracy on OK-VQA

trained individual skills in isolation and then composed those skills
end-to-end in a self-play setting. The resulting policy exhibits robust and
dynamic movement skills such as rapid fall recovery, walking, turning, kicking
and more; and transitions between them in a smooth, stable, and efficient
manner - well beyond what is intuitively expected from the robot. The agents
also developed a basic strategic understanding of the game, and learned, for
instance, to anticipate ball movements and to block opponent shots. The full
range of behaviors emerged from a small set of simple rewards. Our agents were
trained in simulation and transferred to real robots zero-shot. We found that a
combination of sufficiently high-frequency control, targeted dynamics
randomization, and perturbations during training in simulation enabled
good-quality transfer, despite significant unmodeled effects and variations
across robot instances. Although the robots are inherently fragile, minor
hardware modifications together with basic regularization of the behavior
during training led the robots to learn safe and effective movements while
still performing in a dynamic and agile way. Indeed, even though the agents
were optimized for scoring, in experiments they walked 156% faster, took 63%
less time to get up, and kicked 24% faster than a scripted baseline, while
efficiently combining the skills to achieve the longer term objectives.
Examples of the emergent behaviors and full 1v1 matches are available on the

longitude of the main accretion spot (by $\approx 17^{\circ}$) and increases
its elongation (by $\approx 10^{\circ}$). The spectra contain Zeeman

mechanisms that may sustain the steady-state H2-dominated atmosphere include
direct interaction between liquid water and mantle, heat-pipe volcanism from a

aims at automatically generating questions from text. Many applications can
benefit from automatically generated questions, but often it is necessary to
curate those questions, either by selecting or editing them. This task is
informative on its own, but it is typically done post-generation, and, thus,
the effort is wasted. In addition, most existing systems cannot incorporate
this feedback back into them easily. In this work, we present a system, GEN,
that learns from such (implicit) feedback. Following a pattern-based approach,
it takes as input a small set of sentence/question pairs and creates patterns
which are then applied to new unseen sentences. Each generated question, after
being corrected by the user, is used as a new seed in the next iteration, so
more patterns are created each time. We also take advantage of the corrections
made by the user to score the patterns and therefore rank the generated
questions. Results show that GEN is able to improve by learning from both
levels of implicit feedback when compared to the version with no learning,
considering the top 5, 10, and 20 questions. Improvements go up from 10%,

domain shift between training and testing data. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) addresses the domain shift problem by training the model using both
labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain.
Source-Free UDA (SFUDA) was recently proposed for UDA without requiring the
source data during the adaptation, due to data privacy or data transmission
issues, which normally adapts the pre-trained deep model in the testing stage.
However, in real clinical scenarios of medical image segmentation, the trained
model is normally frozen in the testing stage. In this paper, we propose
Fourier Visual Prompting (FVP) for SFUDA of medical image segmentation.
Inspired by prompting learning in natural language processing, FVP steers the
frozen pre-trained model to perform well in the target domain by adding a
visual prompt to the input target data. In FVP, the visual prompt is
parameterized using only a small amount of low-frequency learnable parameters
in the input frequency space, and is learned by minimizing the segmentation
loss between the predicted segmentation of the prompted target image and
reliable pseudo segmentation label of the target image under the frozen model.
To our knowledge, FVP is the first work to apply visual prompts to SFUDA for
medical image segmentation. The proposed FVP is validated using three public
datasets, and experiments demonstrate that FVP yields better segmentation
results, compared with various existing methods.

Measured foliations at infinity of quasi-Fuchsian manifolds are a natural
analog at infinity to the measured bending laminations on the boundary of its

$(\mathsf{F}_{+},\mathsf{F}_{-})$ which fill a closed hyperbolic surface $S$

$t\mathsf{F}_{+}$ and $t\mathsf{F}_{-}$ can be uniquely realised as the
measured foliations at infinity of a quasi-Fuchsian manifold homeomorphic to

proof is based on that of Bonahon in \cite{bonahon05} which shows that a
quasi-Fuchsian manifold close to the Fuchsian locus can be uniquely determined
by the data of filling measured bending laminations on the boundary of its
convex core. Finally, we interpret the result in half-pipe geometry. For the
second part of the thesis we deal with a conjecture due to Thurston asks if
almost-Fuchsian manifolds admit a foliation by CMC surfaces. Here,
almost-Fuchsian manifolds are defined as quasi-Fuchsian manifolds which contain
a unique minimal surface with principal curvatures in $(-1,1)$ and it is known
that in general, quasi-Fuchsian manifolds are not foliated by surfaces of
constant mean curvature (CMC) although their ends are. However, we prove that
almost-Fuchsian manifolds which are sufficiently close to being Fuchsian are
indeed monotonically foliated by surfaces of constant mean curvature. This work

studies, the activity is kept constant as a function of time; however, there
are many examples of active systems in which individual particles transition
from living or moving to dead or nonmotile due to lack of fuel, infection, or
poisoning. Here we consider an active matter particle system at densities where
MIPS does not occur. When we add a small number of infected particles that can
effectively poison other particles, rendering them nonmotile, we find a rich
variety of time dependent pattern formation, including MIPS, a wetting phase,
and a fragmented state formed when mobile particles plow through an nonmotile
packing. We map out the patterns as a function of time scaled by the duration
of the epidemic, and show that the pattern formation is robust for a wide range

does not occur in a random death model, but requires the promotion of
nucleation by contact poisoning. Our results should be relevant to biological

Yet, a significant portion is scattered and locked in data silos, leaving its
potential untapped. Federated Machine Learning is a novel AI paradigm enabling
the creation of AI models from decentralized, potentially siloed data. Hence,
Federated Machine Learning could technically open data silos and therefore
unlock economic potential. However, this requires collaboration between
multiple parties owning data silos. Setting up collaborative business models is
complex and often a reason for failure. Current literature lacks guidelines on
which aspects must be considered to successfully realize collaborative AI
projects. This research investigates the challenges of prevailing collaborative
business models and distinct aspects of Federated Machine Learning. Through a
systematic literature review, focus group, and expert interviews, we provide a
systemized collection of socio-technical challenges and an extended Business
Model Canvas for the initial viability assessment of collaborative AI projects.

the perspectives of both approximation and parameterization. We focus on the
design of efficient approximation schemes, i.e., with running time
$f(\varepsilon,\mathcal{F}) \cdot n^{O(1)}$, which are also of significant
interest to both communities. Technically, our main contribution is a
linear-time approximation-preserving reduction from (Induced) Subgraph Hitting
on any graph class $\mathcal{G}$ of bounded expansion to the same problem on
bounded degree graphs within $\mathcal{G}$. This yields a novel algorithmic
technique to design (efficient) approximation schemes for the problem on very
broad graph classes, well beyond the state-of-the-art. Specifically, applying
this reduction, we derive approximation schemes with (almost) linear running
time for the problem on any graph classes that have strongly sublinear
separators and many important classes of geometric intersection graphs (such as
fat-object graphs, pseudo-disk graphs, etc.). Our proofs introduce novel
concepts and combinatorial observations that may be of independent interest

rare earth - transition metal (RE-TM) ferrimagnetic materials. To date, the
nature and the control of basic traits of skyrmions in these materials are not
fully understood. We show that for an archetypal ferrimagnetic material that
exhibits strong perpendicular anisotropy, the ferrimagnetic skyrmion size can
be tuned by external magnetic fields. Moreover, by taking advantage of the high
spatial resolution of scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and
utilizing a large x-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) contrast that occurs
naturally at the RE resonant edges, we resolve the nature of the magnetic
domain walls of ferrimagnetic skyrmions. We demonstrate that through this
method one can easily discriminate between Bloch and N\'eel type domain walls
for each individual skyrmion. For all isolated ferrimagnetic skyrmions, we
observe that the domain walls are of N\'eel-type. This key information is
corroborated with results of micromagnetic simulations and allows us to
conclude on the nature of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) which
concurs to the stabilisation of skyrmions in ferrimagnetic systems.
Establishing that an intrinsic DMI occurs in RE-TM materials will also be
beneficial towards a deeper understanding of chiral spin texture control in
ferrimagnetic materials.

against simulation results and is independent of the rod aspect ratio. We then
extend our theory by exploring the elastic properties of a hard-rod smectic,
including the layer compressibility ($B$) and bending modulus ($K_{1}$). By
introducing weak backbone flexibility we are able to compare our predictions
with experimental results on smectics of filamentous virus rods and find
quantitative agreement between the smectic layer spacing, the out-of-plane
fluctuation strength, as well as the smectic penetration length $\lambda =
\sqrt{K_{1}/B}$. We demonstrate that the layer bending modulus is dominated by
director splay and depends sensitively on lamellar out-of-plane fluctuations
that we account for on the single-rod level. We find that the ratio between the
smectic penetration length and the lamellar spacing is about two orders of
magnitude smaller than typical values reported for thermotropic smectics. We
attribute this to the fact that colloidal smectics are considerably softer in
terms of layer compression than their thermotropic counterparts while the cost
of layer bending is of comparable magnitude.

focus on extending the model to non-canonical flows. An analytical relationship
between the amplitude modulation coefficient and IOIM parameters is derived,
which is shown to capture the increasing trend of the amplitude modulation
coefficient with an increasing Reynolds number in a smooth-wall dataset. This
relationship is then applied to classify and interpret the non-canonical
turbulent boundary layer results reported in previous works. We further present
the case study of a turbulent boundary layer after a rough-to-smooth change.
Both single-probe and two-probe hotwire measurements are performed to acquire
streamwise velocity time series in the recovering flow on the downstream smooth
wall. An increased coherence between the large-scale motions and the
small-scale envelope in the near-wall region is attributed to the stronger
footprints of the over-energetic large-scale motions in the outer layer,
whereas the near-wall cycle and its amplitude sensitivity to the superposed
structures are similar to that of a canonical smooth-wall flow. These results
indicate that the rough-wall structures above the internal layer interact with
the near-wall cycle in a similar manner as the increasingly energetic
structures in a high-Reynolds number smooth-wall boundary layer.

  abridged for arXiv submission",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aims. We investigate dust attenuation of 122 heavily dust-obscured galaxies
detected with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) and Herschel in the
COSMOS field. We search for correlations between dust attenuation recipes and
the variation of physical parameters, mainly the effective radii of galaxies,
their star formation rates (SFR), and stellar masses, and aim to understand
which of the commonly used laws best describes dust attenuation in dusty
star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Methods. We make use of the extensive
photometric coverage of the COSMOS data combined with highly-resolved dust
continuum maps from ALMA. We use CIGALE to estimate various physical properties
of these dusty objects, mainly their SFR, their stellar masses and their
attenuation. We infer galaxy effective radii (Re) using GALFIT in the Y band of
HSC and ALMA continuum maps. We use these radii to investigate the relative
compactness of the dust continuum and the extension of the rest-frame
UV/optical Re(y)/Re(ALMA). Results. We find that the physical parameters
calculated from our models strongly depend on the assumption of dust
attenuation curve. As expected, the most impacted parameter is the stellar
mass, which leads to a change in the ""starburstiness"" of the objects. We find
that taking into account the relative compactness of star-to-dust emission
prior to SED fitting is crucial, especially when studying dust attenuation of
dusty star-forming galaxies. Shallower attenuation curves did not show a clear
preference of compactness with attenuation, while the Calzetti attenuation
curve preferred comparable spatial extent of unattenuated stellar light and
dust emission. The evolution of the Re(UV)/Re(ALMA) ratio with redshift peeks
around the cosmic noon in our sample of DSFGs, showing that this compactness is
correlated with the cosmic SFR density of these dusty sources.

current explorations do not assess the real-world utility and safety of LLMs in

information needs submitted by physicians as questions to an informatics
consultation service in a safe and concordant manner. Sixty six questions from
an informatics consult service were submitted to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 via simple
prompts. 12 physicians assessed the LLM responses' possibility of patient harm
and concordance with existing reports from an informatics consultation service.
Physician assessments were summarized based on majority vote. For no questions
did a majority of physicians deem either LLM response as harmful. For GPT-3.5,
responses to 8 questions were concordant with the informatics consult report,
20 discordant, and 9 were unable to be assessed. There were 29 responses with
no majority on ""Agree"", ""Disagree"", and ""Unable to assess"". For GPT-4,
responses to 13 questions were concordant, 15 discordant, and 3 were unable to
be assessed. There were 35 responses with no majority. Responses from both LLMs
were largely devoid of overt harm, but less than 20% of the responses agreed
with an answer from an informatics consultation service, responses contained
hallucinated references, and physicians were divided on what constitutes harm.
These results suggest that while general purpose LLMs are able to provide safe
and credible responses, they often do not meet the specific information need of
a given question. A definitive evaluation of the usefulness of LLMs in
healthcare settings will likely require additional research on prompt
engineering, calibration, and custom-tailoring of general purpose models.

can exchange mass, which impacts the evolution of both binary components. Their
evolution is of great interest in the search for the progenitors of
gravitational waves. However, there are unknowns in the physics of mass
transfer as observational examples are rare, especially at low metallicity.
Nearby low-metallicity environments are particularly interesting hunting
grounds for interacting systems as they act as the closest proxy for the early
universe where we can resolve individual stars. Using multi-epoch spectroscopic
data, we complete a consistent spectral and orbital analysis of the early-type
massive binary SSN 7 hosting a ON If$^\ast$+O5.5 V((f)) star. Using these
detailed results, we constrain an evolutionary scenario that can help us to
understand binary evolution in low metallicity. We were able to derive reliable
radial velocities of the two components from the multi-epoch data, which were
used to constrain the orbital parameters. The spectroscopic data covers the UV,
optical, and near-IR, allowing a consistent analysis with the stellar
atmosphere code, PoWR. Given the stellar and orbital parameters, we interpreted
the results using binary evolutionary models. The two stars in the system have
comparable luminosities of ${\log (L_1/L_{\odot}) = 5.75}$ and ${\log

different temperatures (${T_1=43.6\,\mathrm{kK}}$ and
${T_2=38.7\,\mathrm{kK}}$). The primary ($32\,M_{\odot}$) is less massive than
the secondary ($55\,M_{\odot}$), suggesting mass exchange. The mass estimates
are confirmed by the orbital analysis. The revisited orbital period is
$3\,\mathrm{d}$. Our evolutionary models also predict mass exchange. Currently,
the system is a contact binary undergoing a slow Case A phase, making it the

impressive results. On the one hand, text-based conditional models have
achieved remarkable generation quality, by leveraging large-scale datasets of
image-text pairs. To enable fine-grained controllability, however, text-based
models require long prompts, whose details may be ignored by the model. On the
other hand, layout-based conditional models have also witnessed significant
advances. These models rely on bounding boxes or segmentation maps for precise
spatial conditioning in combination with coarse semantic labels. The semantic
labels, however, cannot be used to express detailed appearance characteristics.
In this paper, we approach fine-grained scene controllability through image
collages which allow a rich visual description of the desired scene as well as
the appearance and location of the objects therein, without the need of class
nor attribute labels. We introduce ""mixing and matching scenes"" (M&Ms), an
approach that consists of an adversarially trained generative image model which
is conditioned on appearance features and spatial positions of the different
elements in a collage, and integrates these into a coherent image. We train our
model on the OpenImages (OI) dataset and evaluate it on collages derived from
OI and MS-COCO datasets. Our experiments on the OI dataset show that M&Ms
outperforms baselines in terms of fine-grained scene controllability while
being very competitive in terms of image quality and sample diversity. On the
MS-COCO dataset, we highlight the generalization ability of our model by
outperforming DALL-E in terms of the zero-shot FID metric, despite using two
magnitudes fewer parameters and data. Collage based generative models have the
potential to advance content creation in an efficient and effective way as they

Video Prediction for Visual Planning ($VP^2$), includes simulated environments
with 11 task categories and 310 task instance definitions, a full planning

to expose a simple interface -- a single forward prediction call -- so it is

physical interpretation in terms of their bulk-boundary correspondence. Here,
we derive the edge signatures of all two-dimensional phases with intrinsic
point gap topology. While in one dimension point gap topology invariably leads
to the non-Hermitian skin effect, non-Hermitian boundary physics is
significantly richer in two dimensions. We find two broad classes of
non-Hermitian edge states: (1) Infernal points, where a skin effect occurs only
at a single edge momentum, while all other edge momenta are devoid of edge
states. Under semi-infinite boundary conditions, the point gap thereby closes
completely, but only at a single edge momentum. (2) Non-Hermitian exceptional
point dispersions, where edge states persist at all edge momenta and furnish an
anomalous number of symmetry-protected exceptional points. Surprisingly, the
latter class of systems allows for a finite, non-extensive number of edge
states with a well defined dispersion along all generic edge terminations.
Instead, the point gap only closes along the real and imaginary eigenvalue
axes, realizing a novel form of non-Hermitian spectral flow.

models, we measured the AGN clustering properties as a function of AGN
obscuration defined in terms of hydrogen column density, $N_{\rm H}$. In
addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\rm H} < 10^{22}\,{\rm
cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \leq N_{\rm H} < 10^{23.5}$) AGNs,
we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\rm H}\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to
redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of
X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured
the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the
projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\rm p}(r_{\rm p})$. We modeled
the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\rm H})$,
and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host dark matter halo, $M_{\rm
halo}(z, N_{\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on
obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a
function of $N_{\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification
models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the
obscuring torus. We measured, for the first time, the clustering of highly
obscured AGNs and find that these objects reside in halos with typical mass
$\log M_{\rm halo} = 12.98_{-0.22}^{+0.17} [h^{-1} M_\odot]$
($12.28_{-0.19}^{+0.13}$) at low $z \sim 0.7$ (high $z \sim 1.8$) redshifts. We
find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is
slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the
growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track. This implies that
for those AGNs the clustering is mainly driven by the mass growth rate of the
hosting halos and galaxies across cosmic time.

Evolutionary models predict that the secondaries should have anomalous surface

evolution and subsequent envelope stripping by their companion white dwarfs. To
test these models, we measure sodium (Na) abundances of the donors from the
Fraunhofer ""D"" doublet. Accounting for interstellar absorption, we find that
{\it all} objects in our sample have enhanced Na abundances. We measure 0.3
$\lesssim$ [Na/H] $\lesssim$ 1.5 dex across the sample, with a median [Na/H] =
0.956 dex, i.e., about an order of magnitude enhancement over solar values. To
interpret these values, we run MESA binary evolution models of CVs in which
mass transfer begins just as the donor leaves the main sequence. These
generically predict Na enhancement in donors with initial donor masses $\gtrsim
1\,M_{\odot}$, consistent with our observations. In the models, Na enrichment
occurs in the donors' cores via the NeNa cycle near the end of their
main-sequence evolution. Na-enhanced material is exposed when the binaries
reach orbital periods of a few hours. Donors with higher initial masses are
predicted to have higher Na abundances at fixed orbital period owing to their
higher core temperatures during main-sequence evolution. The observed [Na/H]
values are on average $\approx$0.3 dex higher than predicted by the models.
Surface abundances of evolved CV donors provide a unique opportunity to study
nuclear burning products in the cores of intermediate-mass stars.

of the generalized Doob transform in the stochastic dynamics of Markov chains,

Investigating GALaxy Emission, CIGALE, with a non-parametric star formation
history model (SFH) and fit the data over the wavelength range from the
ultraviolet (UV) up to the mid-infrared (mid-IR). We interpret the difference
between radio and SED-based SFR tracers in the light of recent gradients in the
derived SFH. To validate the robustness of the results, we checked for any
remaining active galaxy nuclei (AGN) contribution and tested the impact of our
SFH modeling approach. Approximately 27% our galaxies present a radio SFR
(SFR$_{\rm radio}$) at least ten times larger than the instantaneous SFR from
SED-fitting (SFR$_{\rm SED}$). This trend affects primarily the galaxies that
show a declining SFH activity over the last 300 Myr. Both SFR indicators
converge toward a consistent value, when the SFHs are averaged over a period
larger than 150 Myr to derive SFR$_{\rm SED}$. Although the radio at low
frequency 1.4 GHz is a good tracer of the star formation activity of galaxies
with constant or increasing SFH, our results indicate that this is not the case

The absorption spectra were calculated using approaches drawn from the

are dominant for moderate to fast rotating stars, reaching amplitudes
comparable to atmospheric signals, but they can be mitigated by shifting the
stellar line proxies to the radial velocity of the planet-occulted region.
Centre-to-limb variations become dominant for slow rotators and are more easily
mitigated at the stellar limb. We re-interpret the ESPRESSO data of two iconic

POLDs. However, we unveil a possible contribution from the planetary atmosphere
that warrants further observations. For MASCARA-1b, we did not find evidence

signature by a POLD for super-solar stellar sodium abundance. We studied POLDs
dependency on star and planet properties, and on the proxy used for
planet-occulted lines. Distinguishing planetary absorption signatures from
POLDs is challenging without access to accurate estimates of the local stellar

machine learning approach for tabular data modeling. However, their complex
structure may lead to low robustness against small covariate perturbation in
unseen data. In this study, we apply one-hot encoding to convert a GBDT model
into a linear framework, through encoding of each tree leaf to one dummy
variable. This allows for the use of linear regression techniques, plus a novel
risk decomposition for assessing the robustness of a GBDT model against
covariate perturbations. We propose to enhance the robustness of GBDT models by
refitting their linear regression forms with $L_1$ or $L_2$ regularization.
Theoretical results are obtained about the effect of regularization on the
model performance and robustness. It is demonstrated through numerical
experiments that the proposed regularization approach can enhance the
robustness of the one-hot-encoded GBDT models.

II and UV Fe II broad-line emissions for two intermediate redshifts (z$\sim$1),
luminous quasars - HE 0413-4031 and HE 0435-4312, monitored by the SALT and 1-m
class telescopes between 2012-2022. Through this technique, we aim to
disentangle the Mg II and Fe II emission regions and to build a
radius-luminosity relation for UV Fe II emission, which has so far remained
unconstrained. Several methodologies have been applied to constrain the time
delays for total Mg II and Fe II emissions. In addition, this technique is
performed to quantify the inflow or outflow of broad-line region gas around the
supermassive black hole and to disentangle the emission/emitting regions from
lines produced in proximity to each other. The mean total FeII time delay is
nearly equal to the mean total MgII time delay for HE 0435-4312 suggesting a
co-spatiality of their emissions. However, in HE 0413-4031, the mean FeII time
delay is found to be longer than the mean MgII time delay, suggesting that FeII
is produced at longer distances from the black hole. The UV FeII R-L relation
is updated with these two quasars and compared with the optical FeII relation,
which suggests that the optical FeII region is located further than the UV FeII
by a factor of 1.7-1.9 i.e. $R_{\rm FeII-opt}\sim(1.7-1.9)R_{\rm FeII-UV}$. We
detected a weak pattern in the time delay vs. wavelength relation, suggesting
that the MgII broad-line originates a bit closer to the SMBH than the UV FeII,
however, the difference is not very significant. Comparison of MgII, UV, and
optical FeII R-L relations suggests that the difference may be larger for
lower-luminosity sources, possibly with the MgII emission originating further
from the SMBH. In the future, more RM data will be acquired to put better
constraints on these trends, in particular the UV FeII R-L relation.

study, we introduce a fully automated, scalable, and versatile realtime

module to counteract potential perturbations such as microscope movements and
frame blurring. We also propose an explainable cell segmentation module to

explanation and model simplification. We demonstrate that interpretability in
deep learning is not the opposite of high performance, but rather provides
essential deep learning algorithm optimization insights and solutions.
Incorporating interpretable modules results in an efficient architecture design

microglial cell phagocytosis in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and obtain
statistically reliable results showing that FTD mutant cells are larger and
more aggressive than control cells. To stimulate translational approaches and

  $h$ and $p$-Geometric Refinement","22 Pages",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Spectral element methods (SEM), which are extensions of finite element
methods (FEM), are important emerging techniques for solving partial
differential equations in physics and engineering. SEM can potentially deliver
better accuracy due to the potential superconvergence for well-shaped
tensor-product elements. However, for complex geometries, the accuracy of SEM
often degrades due to a combination of geometric inaccuracies near curved
boundaries and the loss of superconvergence with simplicial or
non-tensor-product elements. We propose to overcome the first issue by using
$h$- and $p$-geometric refinement, to refine the mesh near high-curvature
regions and increase the degree of geometric basis functions, respectively. We
show that when using mixed-meshes with tensor-product elements in the interior
of the domain, curvature-based geometric refinement near boundaries can improve
the accuracy of the interior elements by reducing pollution errors and
preserving the superconvergence. To overcome the second issue, we apply a
post-processing technique to recover the accuracy near the curved boundaries by
using the adaptive extended stencil finite element method (AES-FEM). The
combination of curvature-based geometric refinement and accurate
post-processing delivers an effective and easier-to-implement alternative to
other methods based on exact geometries. We demonstrate our techniques by
solving the convection-diffusion equation in 2D and show one to two orders of
magnitude of improvement in the solution accuracy, even when the elements are
poorly shaped near boundaries.

In contrast to rigid spheres, the microgel volume and, coupled to this, the

behavior is particularly interesting at high packings where phase transitions
can be induced by external triggers such as temperature in case of
thermoresponsive microgels. A challenge, however, is the determination of the
real volume occupied by these deformable, soft objects and consequently, to
determine the boundaries of the phase transitions. Here we propose core-shell
microgels with a rigid silica core and a crosslinked, thermoresponsive
poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAM) shell with a carefully chosen shell-to-core
size ratio as ideal model colloids to study fluid-solid transitions that are
inducible by millikelvin changes in temperature. Specifically, we identify the
temperature ranges where crystallization and melting occur using absorbance
spectroscopy in a range of concentrations. Slow annealing from the fluid to the
crystalline state leads to photonic crystals with Bragg peaks in the visible
wavelength range and very narrow linewidths. Small-angle X-ray scattering is
then used to confirm the structure of the fluid phase as well as the long-range
order, crystal structure and microgel volume fraction in the solid phase.
Thanks to the scattering contrasts and volume ratio of the cores with respect
to the shells, the scattering data do allow for form factor analysis revealing
osmotic deswelling at volume fractions approaching and also exceeding the hard

on the spatial structure of their charge and magnetization distributions. While
measurements of the proton are relatively straightforward, the lack of a free
neutron target makes measurements of the neutron's electromagnetic structure
more challenging and more sensitive to experimental or model-dependent
uncertainties. Various experiments have attempted to extract the neutron form
factors from scattering from the neutron in deuterium, with different
techniques providing different, and sometimes large, systematic uncertainties.
We present results from a novel measurement of the neutron magnetic form factor
using quasielastic scattering from the mirror nuclei $^3$H and $^3$He, where
the nuclear effects are larger than for deuterium but expected to largely
cancel in the cross-section ratios. We extracted values of the neutron magnetic
form factor for low-to-modest momentum transfer, $0.6<Q^2<2.9$ GeV$^2$, where
existing measurements give inconsistent results. The precision and $Q^2$ range
of this data allow for a better understanding of the current world's data, and
suggest a path toward further improvement of our overall understanding of the

weight actions by their reduction in distance estimates. Theoretically, DWSL
converges to an optimal policy constrained to the data distribution, an
attractive property for offline learning, without any bootstrapping. Across all

FWHM generally decrease with wavelength: the maximum and RMS fractional

Using simulated images of broad-line AGNs, we evaluate the impact of PSF
mismatches on the recoverability of host galaxy properties. Host fluxes are
generally overestimated when adopting mismatched PSF models, with larger
overestimation for more AGN-dominated systems. Broader PSFs tend to produce
less concentrated hosts while narrower PSFs tend to produce more concentrated

model mismatches are generally larger than the formal fitting uncertainties for
high signal-to-noise ratio data. Image decomposition can also lead to an

$>1\sigma$ [$3\sigma$] detection in $\sim 80%$ [$\sim 20-30\%$] of systems),

data of mobile tower locations. The model grids the planet's surface into
small, computationally manageable regions, assuming a simple integrated
transmission pattern for the mobile antennas. In this model, these mobile tower
regions rise and set as the Earth rotates. In this way, a dynamic power
spectrum of the Earth was determined, summed over all cellular frequency bands.
We calculated this dynamic power spectrum from three different viewing points,
HD 95735, Barnard star, and Alpha Centauri A. Our preliminary results
demonstrate that the peak power leaking into space from mobile towers is $\sim
4$GW. This is associated with LTE mobile tower technology emanating from the
East Coast of China as viewed from HD 95735. We demonstrate that the mobile
tower leakage is periodic, direction dependent, and could not currently be
detected by a nearby civilization located within 10 light years of the Earth,
using instrumentation with a sensitivity similar to the Green Bank Telescope.
We plan to extend our model to include more powerful 5G mobile systems, radar
installations, ground based uplinks (including the Deep Space Network), and
various types of satellite services, including low Earth orbit constellations
such as Starlink and OneWeb.

between Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) wavefunctions have plagued the
development of HFB-based many-body theories for decades. The problem arises
from divisions by zero in the standard formulation of the nonorthogonal Wick's
theorem in the limit of vanishing HFB overlap. In this paper, we present a
robust formulation of Wick's theorem that stays well-behaved regardless of
whether the HFB states are orthogonal or not. This new formulation ensures
cancellation between the zeros of the overlap and the poles of the Pfaffian,
which appears naturally in fermionic systems. Our formula explicitly eliminates
self-interaction, which otherwise causes additional numerical challenges. A
computationally efficient version of our formalism enables robust
symmetry-projected HFB calculations with the same computational cost as
mean-field theories. Moreover, we avoid potentially diverging normalization
factors by introducing a robust normalization procedure. The resulting
formalism treats even and odd number of particles on equal footing and reduces
to Hartree-Fock as a natural limit. As proof of concept, we present a
numerically stable and accurate solution to a Jordan-Wigner-transformed
Hamiltonian, whose singularities motivated the present work. Our robust
formulation of Wick's theorem is a most promising development for methods using
quasiparticle vacuum states.

probabilistic notions: stochastic domination and finitary codings (also called
finitary factors).
  On the stochastic domination side, we show that the plus state of the Ising
model at very low temperature stochastically dominates a high density Bernoulli
percolation if and only if the underlying graph is nonamenable. This answers a
question of Liggett and Steif. We prove a similar result for the ``infinite
cluster process'' of Bernoulli percolation, which is of particular interest as
this process is not monotone and does not possess any nice form of the domain
Markov property. We also prove that the plus states of the Ising model at very
low temperatures are stochastically ordered if and only if the graph is
nonamenable. This answers a second question of Liggett and Steif. We further
show that these stochastic domination results can be witnessed by invariant
monotone couplings.
  On the finitary coding side, we show that the plus state of the Ising model
at very low temperature is a finitary factor of an i.i.d. process if and only
if the underlying graph is nonamenable (assuming it supports a phase
transition). We show a similar result for the infinite cluster process of a
high-density Bernoulli percolation.
  A main technique is to consider diluted processes, for which Holley's
condition can be established. In order to compare two Ising models, we apply a
dilution mechanism using lattice gas theory. Along the way we develop general
tools to establish invariant domination when Holley's condition is satisfied.
The finitary factor results are based on the stochastic domination results and
a dynamical construction involving bounding chains, along with a new technique
to analyze coupling from the past in infinite-range processes via a novel
disease spreading model, which may be of independent interest.

settings, from low-density to high-density plasmas, and appear in both space
and laboratory plasmas. Despite being widely used as a model, the origin of the
kappa distribution remains, to this day, unclear. For instance, deviations from
the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution are sometimes regarded as a signature of the
non-additivity of the thermodynamic entropy, although there are alternative
frameworks such as superstatistics where such an assumption is not needed. In
this work we recover the kappa distribution for particle velocities in a
non-equilibrium, steady-state plasma from the theory of superstatistics,
assuming only a single requirement on the dependence between the kinetic energy
of a test particle and that of its immediate environment. Most importantly,
unlike previous derivations based on superstatistics, we do not make any
assumption about temperature or its statistical distribution, instead obtaining
them from the requirement on kinetic energies. Our results suggest that a
description of kappa-distributed plasma is simpler in terms of features of the
inverse temperature distribution rather than the traditional parameters
$\kappa$ and the thermal velocity $v_{\text{th}}$.

PINN's ability to predict real-world dynamical systems. The mean value model of
the diesel engine incorporates empirical formulae to represent certain states,
but these formulae may not be generalizable to other engines. To address this,
the study considers the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) in addition to the
PINN model. The DNNs are trained using laboratory test data and are used to
model the engine-specific empirical formulae in the mean value model, allowing
for a more flexible and adaptive representation of the engine's states. In
other words, the mean value model uses both the PINN model and the DNNs to
represent the engine's states, with the PINN providing a physics-based
understanding of the engine's overall dynamics and the DNNs offering a more
engine-specific and adaptive representation of the empirical formulae. By
combining these two approaches, the study aims to offer a comprehensive and
versatile approach to monitoring the health and performance of diesel engines.

be establishing the identity of a suspect associated with partial and smudgy
fingerprints left at a crime scene (i.e., latent prints or fingermarks).
Despite the success of fixed-length embeddings for rolled and slap fingerprint
recognition, the features learned for latent fingerprint matching have mostly
been limited to local minutiae-based embeddings and have not directly leveraged
global representations for matching. In this paper, we combine global
embeddings with local embeddings for state-of-the-art latent to rolled matching
accuracy with high throughput. The combination of both local and global
representations leads to improved recognition accuracy across NIST SD 27, NIST
SD 302, MSP, MOLF DB1/DB4, and MOLF DB2/DB4 latent fingerprint datasets for
both closed-set (84.11%, 54.36%, 84.35%, 70.43%, 62.86% rank-1 retrieval rate,
respectively) and open-set (0.50, 0.74, 0.44, 0.60, 0.68 FNIR at FPIR=0.02,
respectively) identification scenarios on a gallery of 100K rolled
fingerprints. Not only do we fuse the complimentary representations, we also
use the local features to guide the global representations to focus on
discriminatory regions in two fingerprint images to be compared. This leads to
a multi-stage matching paradigm in which subsets of the retrieved candidate
lists for each probe image are passed to subsequent stages for further
processing, resulting in a considerable reduction in latency (requiring just
0.068 ms per latent to rolled comparison on a AMD EPYC 7543 32-Core Processor,
roughly 15K comparisons per second). Finally, we show the generalizability of
the fused representations for improving authentication accuracy across several
rolled, plain, and contactless fingerprint datasets.

smooth component and a population of smaller, gravitationally bound subhaloes.
These components are often treated as a single halo when halo properties, such
as density profiles, are extracted from simulations. Recent work has shown that
density profiles change substantially when subhalo mass is excluded. In this
paper, we expand on this result by analysing the change in three specific host
halo properties -- concentration ($c_{\rm{NFW}}$), spin ($\lambda_{\rm
Bullock}$), and shape ($c/a$), -- when calculated only from the smooth
component of the halo. This analysis is performed on both Milky Way-mass haloes
and cluster-mass haloes in high-resolution, zoom-in, $N$-body simulations. We
find that when subhaloes are excluded the median value of (1) $c_{\rm{NFW}}$ is
enhanced by $\approx 38 \pm 12\%$ and $\approx 88 \pm 7.7\%$ for Milky Way mass
($10^{12.1}\,\text{M}_\odot$) and cluster mass ($10^{14.8}\,\text{M}_\odot$)
haloes respectively, (2) $\lambda_{\rm Bullock}$ is reduced for Milky Way mass
by $\approx 16 \pm 6.8\%$ and cluster mass haloes by $\approx 32 \pm 8.9\%$.
Additionally, with the removal of subhaloes, cluster mass haloes tend to become
more spherical as the ratio of minor-to-major axis, $c/a$, increases by
$\approx 12 \pm 4\%$, whereas Milky Way mass haloes remain approximately the
same shape with $c/a$ changed by $\approx 1.2 \pm 5.6\%$. The fractional change
of each of these properties depends primarily on the amount of mass that is
removed from the halo system and, to a lesser extent, mass accretion history.
Our findings demonstrate that the properties of the smooth components of dark
matter haloes are biased relative to the total mass of the halo including
subhaloes.

This is in contrast to the well-known purely multiplicative renormalization of
the singlet axial-current operator defined with a non-anticommuting $\gamma_5$.
Consequently, without introducing compensation terms in the form of additional
renormalization, the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly equation does not hold
automatically in the bare form in this kind of schemes. We determine the
corresponding (gauge-dependent) coefficient to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ in

the conventional pretraining-finetuning pipeline for integrating such

ProgramPort, a modular approach to better leverage pretrained VL models by
exploiting the syntactic and semantic structures of language instructions. Our
framework uses a semantic parser to recover an executable program, composed of
functional modules grounded on vision and action across different modalities.
Each functional module is realized as a combination of deterministic
computation and learnable neural networks. Program execution produces
parameters to general manipulation primitives for a robotic end-effector. The
entire modular network can be trained with end-to-end imitation learning

However, such models are based on simplifications that seldom limit their
applicability to real cases. One common assumption is the incompressibility of

propose a simple model that accounts for linearly elastic compressibility, and
its interplay with toughness, stiffness, and elastic strain-stiffening.
Confirming previous theories and experiments, materials having high-toughness
and low-modulus exhibit the highest puncture resistance at a given needle
radius. Surprisingly, in these conditions, we observe that incompressible

compressibility can create an additional (strain) energy barrier to puncture.

had the highest accuracy for the ZTF dataset, while for SSPDB, it had lower
accuracy than the baseline where none of these methods are applied. Where

statistics. While modern two-sample tests, such as the edge count test and its
variants, can handle multivariate and non-Euclidean data, contemporary
gargantuan datasets often exhibit heterogeneity due to the presence of latent
subpopulations. Direct application of these tests, without regulating for such
heterogeneity, may lead to incorrect statistical decisions. We develop a new
nonparametric testing procedure that accurately detects differences between the
two samples in the presence of unknown heterogeneity in the data generation
process. Our framework handles this latent heterogeneity through a composite
null that entertains the possibility that the two samples arise from a mixture
distribution with identical component distributions but with possibly different
mixing weights. In this regime, we study the asymptotic behavior of weighted
edge count test statistic and show that it can be effectively re-calibrated to
detect arbitrary deviations from the composite null. For practical
implementation we propose a Bootstrapped Weighted Edge Count test which
involves a bootstrap-based calibration procedure that can be easily implemented
across a wide range of heterogeneous regimes. A comprehensive simulation study
and an application to detecting aberrant user behaviors in online games
demonstrates the excellent non-asymptotic performance of the proposed test.

tasks to support human everyday activities. However, it's challenging as the
model needs to predict an arbitrary number of entity state changes caused by
the action while most of the entities are implicitly relevant to the actions
and their attributes as well as states are from open vocabularies. To tackle
these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end Knowledge Informed framework
for open domain Entity State Tracking, namely KIEST, which explicitly retrieves
the relevant entities and attributes from external knowledge graph (i.e.,
ConceptNet) and incorporates them to autoregressively generate all the entity
state changes with a novel dynamic knowledge grained encoder-decoder framework.
To enforce the logical coherence among the predicted entities, attributes, and
states, we design a new constraint decoding strategy and employ a coherence
reward to improve the decoding process. Experimental results show that our
proposed KIEST framework significantly outperforms the strong baselines on the
public benchmark dataset OpenPI.

also reflect social biases they inherit from their training data, which is
often crawled from the internet. Manually auditing models for biases can be
very time and resource consuming and is further complicated by the unbounded

multimodal models requires a different approach. In this paper, we propose
Multimodal Composite Association Score (MCAS) as a new method of measuring

Stable Diffusion using this approach uncovered the presence of gendered

efficiently optimizing a sufficient number of solution candidates. We then
demonstrated that the NeuLag method can find optimal solutions even when

The derived binary parameters are useful in constraining the evolutionary

our model to the observed photometry of some known stripped-envelope supernova
companions (SN1993J, SN2001ig, SN2006jc, SN2011dh, SN2013ge). Combined with
other observational constraints such as the pre-supernova progenitor

companion on a tight orbit. This trend suggests that type IIb supernova
progenitors evolved from stable mass transfer channels and type Ibc progenitors

learning of various language or visual phenomena. New methods freed data
scientists from hand-crafting features for common tasks. Similarly, problems
that require considering the spatial variable can benefit from pretrained map
region representations instead of manually creating feature tables that one
needs to prepare to solve a task. However, very few methods for map area
representation exist, especially with respect to road network characteristics.
In this paper, we propose a method for generating microregions' embeddings with
respect to their road infrastructure characteristics. We base our
representations on OpenStreetMap road networks in a selection of cities and use
the H3 spatial index to allow reproducible and scalable representation
learning. We obtained vector representations that detect how similar map
hexagons are in the road networks they contain. Additionally, we observe that
embeddings yield a latent space with meaningful arithmetic operations. Finally,
clustering methods allowed us to draft a high-level typology of obtained
representations. We are confident that this contribution will aid data
scientists working on infrastructure-related prediction tasks with spatial
variables.

effect of different tie-breaking rules on effort. For ratio-form and
difference-form contests that admit pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, we find
that the effort of both players is monotone decreasing in the probability that
ties are broken in favor of the stronger player. Thus, the effort-maximizing
tie-breaking rule commits to breaking ties in favor of the weaker agent. With
symmetric agents, we find that the equilibrium is generally symmetric and
independent of the tie-breaking rule. We also study the design of random
tie-breaking rules that are unbiased ex-ante and identify sufficient conditions
under which breaking ties before the contest actually leads to greater expected
effort than the more commonly observed practice of breaking ties after the

communication, motivating the need to develop AI agents that can reliably

completion and procedural understanding, current AI has no mechanisms to
automatically track and explain procedures in unseen stories. To bridge this
gap, we study the ability of AI models to transfer procedural knowledge to
novel narrative tasks in a transparent manner. We design LEAP: a comprehensive
framework that integrates state-of-the-art modeling architectures, training
regimes, and augmentation strategies based on both natural and synthetic
stories. To address the lack of densely annotated training data, we devise a
robust automatic labeler based on few-shot prompting to enhance the augmented
data. Our experiments with in- and out-of-domain tasks reveal insights into the
interplay of different architectures, training regimes, and augmentation
strategies. LEAP's labeler has a clear positive impact on out-of-domain
datasets, while the resulting dense annotation provides native explainability.

  Learning Framework for Imaging and Therapy Monitoring",,,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Radiation-induced acoustic (RA) imaging is a promising technique for
visualizing radiation energy deposition in tissues, enabling new imaging
modalities and real-time therapy monitoring. However, it requires measuring
hundreds or even thousands of averages to achieve satisfactory signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). This repetitive measurement increases ionizing radiation dose
and degrades the temporal resolution of RA imaging, limiting its clinical
utility. In this study, we developed a general deep inception convolutional
neural network (GDI-CNN) to denoise RA signals to substantially reduce the
number of averages. The multi-dilation convolutions in the network allow for
encoding and decoding signal features with varying temporal characteristics,
making the network generalizable to signals from different radiation sources.
The proposed method was evaluated using experimental data of X-ray-induced
acoustic, protoacoustic, and electroacoustic signals, qualitatively and
quantitatively. Results demonstrated the effectiveness and generalizability of
GDI-CNN: for all the enrolled RA modalities, GDI-CNN achieved comparable SNRs
to the fully-averaged signals using less than 2% of the averages, significantly
reducing imaging dose and improving temporal resolution. The proposed deep
learning framework is a general method for few-frame-averaged acoustic signal
denoising, which significantly improves RA imaging's clinical utilities for
low-dose imaging and real-time therapy monitoring.

decade. While many photoinitiated experiments have been conducted, a
cross-examination of bP's photocarrier and structural dynamics is still
lacking. In this report, we provide such analysis by examining time-resolved
data acquired using optical transient reflectivity and reflection ultrafast
electron diffraction, two complementary methods under the same experimental
conditions. At elevated excitation fluences, we find that more than 90% of the
photoinjected carriers are annihilated within the first picosecond (ps) and
transfer their energy to phonons in a nonthermal, anisotropic fashion.
Electronically, the remaining carrier density around the band edges induces a
significant interaction that leads to an interlayer lattice contraction in a
few ps but soon diminishes as a result of the continuing loss of carriers.
Structurally, phonon-phonon scattering redistributes the energy in the lattice
and results in the generation of out-of-plane coherent acoustic phonons and
thermal lattice expansion. Their onset times at ~6 ps are found to be in good
agreement. Later, a thermalized quasi-equilibrium state is reached following a
period of about 40-50 ps. Hence, we propose a picture with five temporal
regimes for bP's photodynamics.

schemes are often limited by the low quality-factors of resonators and
fabrication disorders. Hence, exploring new mechanisms of the electronic sensor
with a high-level sensitivity and a strong robustness is of great significance.
Here, we propose a new way to design electronic sensors with superior
performances based on exotic properties of non-Hermitian topological physics.
Owing to the extreme boundary-sensitivity of non-Hermitian topological zero
modes, the frequency shift induced by boundary perturbations can show an
exponential growth trend with respect to the size of non-Hermitian
topolectrical circuit sensors. Moreover, such an exponential growth sensitivity
is also robust against disorders of circuit elements. Using designed
non-Hermitian topolectrical circuit sensors, we further experimentally verify
the ultra-sensitive identification of the distance, rotation angle, and liquid
level with the designed capacitive devices. Our proposed non-Hermitian
topolectrical circuit sensors can possess a wide range of applications in
ultra-sensitive environmental monitoring and show an exciting prospect for

minimizers which are extremely flat and wide. These minimizers coexist with a
background of dominant solutions which are composed by an exponential number of
algorithmically inaccessible small clusters for the binary case (the frozen
1-RSB phase) or a hierarchical structure of clusters of different sizes for the
spherical case (the full RSB phase). In both cases, when a certain threshold in
constraint density is crossed, the local entropy of the wide flat minima
becomes non-monotonic, indicating a break-up of the space of robust solutions
into disconnected components. This has a strong impact on the behavior of
algorithms in binary models, which cannot access the remaining isolated
clusters. For the spherical case the behaviour is different, since even beyond
the disappearance of the wide flat minima the remaining solutions are shown to
always be surrounded by a large number of other solutions at any distance, up
to capacity. Indeed, we exhibit numerical evidence that algorithms seem to find
solutions up to the SAT/UNSAT transition, that we compute here using an 1RSB
approximation. For both models, the generalization performance as a learning
device is shown to be greatly improved by the existence of wide flat minimizers

of CO and H$_2$ abundances. The formation and dissociation of CO and H$_2$ in
typical dense clouds are modelled in a manner consistent with the grain size
distribution. The evolution of grain size distribution is calculated based on
our previous model, which treats the galaxy as a one-zone object but includes
various dust processing mechanisms in the interstellar medium (ISM). We find
that typical dense clouds become fully molecular (H$_2$) when the dust surface
area increases by shattering while an increase of dust abundance by dust growth
in the ISM is necessary for a significant rise of the CO abundance.
Accordingly, the metallicity dependence of the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor,
$X_\mathrm{CO}$, is predominantly driven by dust growth. We also examine the
effect of grain size distribution in the galaxy by changing the dense gas
fraction, which controls the balance between coagulation and shattering,
clarifying that the difference in the grain size distribution significantly
affects $X_\mathrm{CO}$ even if the dust-to-gas ratio is the same. The star
formation time-scale, which controls the speed of metal enrichment also affects
the metallicity at which the CO abundance rapidly increases (or $X_\mathrm{CO}$
drops). We also propose dust-based formulae for $X_\mathrm{CO}$, which need
further tests for establishing their usefulness.

for the first order necessary optimality condition to hold. This gives rise to
a notion of facial reduction for nonlinear conic programming, that allows
locally redefining the original problem only in terms of this specific face
instead of the whole cone, providing a more robust formulation of the problem
in which Robinson's condition holds. We were also able to prove the strong
second-order necessary optimality condition in this context by considering only
the subfaces of this particular face, which is a new result even in nonlinear

utilizing current quantum computing infrastructures. VQAs are based on a
parameterized quantum circuit optimized in a closed loop via a classical
algorithm. This hybrid approach reduces the quantum processing unit load but
comes at the cost of a classical optimization that can feature a flat energy
landscape. Existing optimization techniques, including either imaginary
time-propagation, natural gradient, or momentum-based approaches, are promising
candidates but place either a significant burden on the quantum device or
suffer frequently from slow convergence. In this work, we propose the quantum
Broyden adaptive natural gradient (qBang) approach, a novel optimizer that aims
to distill the best aspects of existing approaches. By employing the Broyden
approach to approximate updates in the Fisher information matrix and combining
it with a momentum-based algorithm, qBang reduces quantum-resource requirements
while performing better than more resource-demanding alternatives. Benchmarks
for the barren plateau, quantum chemistry, and the max-cut problem demonstrate
an overall stable performance with a clear improvement over existing techniques
in the case of flat optimization landscapes. qBang introduces a new development
strategy for gradient-based VQAs with a plethora of possible improvements.

common coupling to the radiation bath via a Chern-Simons term, as a consequence
of the $U(1)$ anomaly. The non-equilibrium effective action that describes this
mixing phenomenon is obtained to second order in the coupling of neutral pions
and axions to photons. We show that a misaligned axion condensate induces a
neutral pion condensate after the QCD phase transition. The dynamics of the
pion condensate displays long and short time scales and decays on the longer
time scale exhibiting a phenomenon akin to the ``purification'' in a Kaon beam.
On the intermediate time scales the macroscopic pion condensate is proportional
to a condensate of the abelian Chern-Simons term induced by the axion. We argue
that the coupling to the common bath also induces kinetic mixing. We obtain the
axion and pion populations, and these exhibit thermalization with the bath. The
mutual coupling to the bath induces long-lived axion- neutral pion coherence
independent of initial conditions. The framework of the effective action and
many of the consequences are more broadly general and applicable to scalar or

with the current $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Here we investigate the possibility of
alleviating the tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in
counting massive galaxies at high $z$: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass
estimate, and contribution by backsplash. We find that each of the sources can
significantly increase the cumulative stellar mass density $\rho_*(>M_*)$ at
the high-mass end, and the combination of them can boost the density by more
than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of
$\epsilon_* \sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone can reduce the tension to
$2\sigma$ level, except the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Including in addition
a lognormal dispersion with a width of 0.3 dex in the stellar mass can bring
the observed stellar mass density at $z \sim 7 - 10$ to the $2\sigma$ range of
the cosmic variance. The tension is completely eliminated when gas stripped
from backsplash halos is also taken into account. Our results highlight the
importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data
of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the
descendants of high $z$ massive galaxies. We find that a significant portion of
these galaxies end up in massive halos with mass $M_{\rm halo} > 10^{13}
h^{-1}M_\odot $ at $z=0$. A large fraction of central galaxies in $M_{\rm halo}
\geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\odot$ halos today are predicted to contain
significant amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z\sim 8$.
This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population

temporal sequence and learning semantics representations of the repost
sequence. However, extracting informative support from the topological
structure of propagation and the influence of reposting authors for debunking
rumors is crucial, which generally has not been well addressed by existing

trees in terms of both posts and authors, i.e., author tree and post tree.
Accordingly, we propose a novel rumor detection model with hierarchical
representation on the bipartite adhoc event trees called BAET. Specifically, we
introduce word embedding and feature encoder for the author and post tree,
respectively, and design a root-aware attention module to perform node
representation. Then we adopt the tree-like RNN model to capture the structural
correlations and propose a tree-aware attention module to learn tree
representation for the author tree and post tree, respectively. Extensive
experimental results on two public Twitter datasets demonstrate the

PSPACE-complete even when restricted to instances with constant treewidth of

prior works have left a gap in our understanding of the complexity of QSAT when

notably via incidence graphs. In this paper, we develop structure-aware
reductions which allow us to obtain essentially tight lower bounds for highly

bounded treedepth or feedback vertex number. We complement these lower bounds
with novel algorithms for QSAT which establish a nearly-complete picture of the

demonstrated on strain-rate-sensitive soft materials. This model is based on
the viscous dissipation-based visco-hyperelasticity framework where the total
stress is decomposed into volumetric, isochoric hyperelastic, and isochoric
viscous overstress contributions. It is shown that each of these stress
components can be written as linear combinations of the components of an
irreducible integrity basis. Three Gaussian process regression-based surrogate
models are trained (one per stress component) between principal invariants of
strain and strain rate tensors and the corresponding coefficients of the
integrity basis components. It is demonstrated that this type of model
construction enforces key physics-based constraints on the predicted responses:
the second law of thermodynamics, the principles of local action and
determinism, objectivity, the balance of angular momentum, an assumed reference
state, isotropy, and limited memory. The three surrogate models that constitute
our constitutive model are evaluated by training them on small-size numerically
generated data sets corresponding to a single deformation mode and then
analyzing their predictions over a much wider testing regime comprising
multiple deformation modes. Our physics-informed data-driven constitutive model
predictions are compared with the corresponding predictions of classical
continuum thermodynamics-based and purely data-driven models. It is shown that
our surrogate models can reasonably capture the stress-strain-strain rate

design of aircraft and turbomachinery. While it is possible to achieve accurate
predictions using direct solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations,
applications of such solvers is not feasible in design optimization due to the
high cost of resolving wave phenomena in an Eulerian setting. In this work, we
propose a technique for highly accelerated predictions of aeroacoustic response
using a data-driven model reduction approach based on the eigensystem
realization algorithm (ERA), as a non-intrusive balanced truncation method.
Specifically, we create and compare ERA ROMs based on the training data
generated by solving the linearized and nonlinear Euler equations with Gaussian
pulse inputs, and use them for prediction of the aeroacoustic response of an
airfoil subject to different types of gust loading. The results show that both
ROMs are in good agreement with the full-order model (FOM) solution in a purely
predictive setting, while achieving orders of magnitude reduction in the online
computation time. Using ERA for prediction of the acoustic response requires
activating each input channel separately in the FOM for training ROMs, and
operating on a large Hankel matrix, that can become computationally infeasible.
We address this bottleneck in two steps: first, we propose a multi-fidelity
gappy POD method to identify the most impactful input channels based on a
coarser grid. Therefore, we reduce the computation cost on the FOM and ROM
levels as we build the Markov sequence by querying the high-resolution FOM only
for the input channels identified by gappy POD. Second, we use tangential
interpolation at the ROM level to reduce the size of the Hankel matrix. The
proposed methods enable application of ERA for highly accurate online acoustic
response prediction and reduce the offline computation cost of ROMs.

whispering gallery modes. Here, we demonstrate the asymmetric emission of
chiral coupling from single quantum dots in a topological resonator by tuning
the coupling between a quantum emitter and a resonator mode. Under a magnetic

splits into two exciton spin states with opposite circularly polarized
emissions due to Zeeman effect. Two branches of the quantum dot emissions
couple to a resonator mode in different degrees, resulting in an asymmetric

contribute significant environmental benefits and ecosystem services to
increase resiliency. Long-term benefits from tree-based livelihoods, however,
depend on sustainable timber harvesting. In this paper, we discuss the
potential for network analysis as a tool to inform conservation and development

farmers and traders as a transportation problem and optimize the transactions.
We create a model of the commercial tree market in the Bilaspur district of
Himachal Pradesh, India based on a detailed dataset of market interactions
between farmers and timber traders, using the existing road network of this
region. Using this model, we perform a maximum-flow-minimum-cost optimization
for tree commodity flow. We compare the results of our optimized model with
actual flow within the network, and we find a high potential to increase
efficiency of market transactions within this region, noting a significant
reduction to the minimum- cost flow value for our optimized model compared to
the flow cost for actual transactions. We propose that using this network flow
optimization model to strategically distribute permits can reduce costs
associated with market transactions. Our results suggest that this direct
policy action would be beneficial to the region. Finally, we suggest that cost
savings could be used to establish tree planting programs to support a
long-term sustainable tree market. Shaping policies to address these market
inefficiencies in developing regions could help support and elevate tree-based

an occupied bandwidth of about 130 meV. The measured band structure shows
prominent quasiparticle kinks and a replica band involving high-energy
Jahn-Teller active Hg(8) phonon mode, reflecting strong electron-phonon
coupling in the system. The electron-phonon coupling constant is estimated to
be about 1.2, which dominates the quasiparticle mass renormalization. Moreover,
we observe an isotropic nodeless superconducting gap beyond the mean-field
estimation. Both the large electron-phonon coupling constant and large reduced
superconducting gap suggest a strong-coupling superconductivity in K3C60, while
the electronic correlation effect is indicated by the observation of a
waterfall-like band dispersion and the small bandwidth compared with the
effective Coulomb interaction. Our results not only directly visualize the
crucial band structure of superconducting fulleride but also provide important

several detection frameworks have been proposed to detect whether a single

adversarial physical attacks against single input images to DNN models.
Building upon that work, we propose VisionGuard* (VG), which couples VG with

artifacts in models with the ultraviolet cutoff (e.g., NJL models). The model
exhibits a crossover transition of pion condensations from the
Bose-Einstein-Condensation regime at low density to the
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime at high density. The EOS stiffens quickly and
approaches the quark matter regime at density significantly less than the
density for pions to spatially overlap. The sound velocity develops a peak in
the crossover region, and then gradually relaxes to the conformal value $1/3$
from above, in contrast to the perturbative QCD results which predicts the
approach from below. In the context of QCD computations, this opposite trend is
in part due to the lack of gluon exchanges in our model, and also due to the
non-perturbative power corrections arising from the condensates. We argue that
with large power corrections the trace anomaly can be negative. In quantitative
level, our EOS is consistent with the lattice results in the BEC regime but
begins to get stiffer at higher density. The sound velocity peak also appears
at higher density. The BCS gap in our model is $\Delta \simeq 300$ MeV in the

This can be problematic because some players may get stuck if the progression
is too difficult, while others may find it boring if the progression is too
slow to get to more challenging levels. This can be addressed by building
levels based on the player's performance and preferences. In this work, we
formulate the problem of generating levels for a player as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP) and use adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) to solve the MDP
before assembling a level. We tested with two case studies and found that using
an ADP outperforms two baselines. Furthermore, we experimented with player
proxies and switched them in the middle of play, and we show that a simple
modification prior to running ADP results in quick adaptation. By using ADP,
which searches the entire MDP, we produce a dynamic progression of levels that
adapts to the player.

learning, Vision Language Pretraining (VLP) models have achieved promising
improvements on various multi-modal downstream tasks. Albeit powerful, these
pre-training models still do not take advantage of world knowledge, which is
implicit in multi-modal data but comprises abundant and complementary
information. In this work, we propose a REtrieval-based knowledge Augmented
Vision Language Pre-training model (REAVL), which retrieves world knowledge
from knowledge graphs (KGs) and incorporates them in vision-language
pre-training. REAVL has two core components: a knowledge retriever that
retrieves knowledge given multi-modal data, and a knowledge-augmented model
that fuses multi-modal data and knowledge. By novelly unifying four
knowledge-aware self-supervised tasks, REAVL promotes the mutual integration of
multi-modal data and knowledge by fusing explicit knowledge with
vision-language pairs for masked multi-modal data modeling and KG relational
reasoning. Empirical experiments show that REAVL achieves new state-of-the-art
performance uniformly on knowledge-based vision-language understanding and
multimodal entity linking tasks, and competitive results on general
vision-language tasks while only using 0.2% pre-training data of the best
models.

focuses on maximizing expected profit by deciding on inventory and pricing
levels based on historical demand and feature data. We first build an
approximate model by assigning weights to historical samples. However, due to
decision-dependent effects, the resulting approximate model is complicated and
unable to solve directly. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of
approximate gradients and design an Approximate Gradient Descent (AGD)
algorithm. We analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithm in both convex
and non-convex settings, which correspond to the newsvendor pricing model and
its variants respectively. Finally, we perform numerical experiment on both
simulated and real-world dataset to demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of the AGD algorithm. We find that the AGD algorithm can converge
to the local maximum provided that the approximation is effective. We also
illustrate the significance of two characteristics: distribution-free and
decision-dependent of our model. Consideration of the decision-dependent effect
is necessary for approximation, and the distribution-free model is preferred
when there is little information on the demand distribution and how demand
reacts to the pricing decision. Moreover, the proposed model and algorithm are
not limited to the newsvendor problem, but can also be used for a wide range of
decision-dependent problems.

We begin our analysis by deriving the efficient influence function and the
semiparametric efficiency bound for the average treatment effect on the treated
(ATT). We introduce nonparametric estimators that attain the semiparametric
efficiency bound under mild rate conditions on the estimators of the nuisance
functions, exhibiting a type of rate doubly-robust (DR) property. Additionally,
we document a trade-off related to compositional changes: We derive the
asymptotic bias of DR DiD estimators that erroneously exclude compositional
changes and the efficiency loss when one fails to correctly rule out
compositional changes. We propose a nonparametric Hausman-type test for
compositional changes based on these trade-offs. The finite sample performance
of the proposed DiD tools is evaluated through Monte Carlo experiments and an
empirical application. As a by-product of our analysis, we present a new
uniform stochastic expansion of the local polynomial multinomial logit
estimator, which may be of independent interest.

quantitative models of compressive yield strength and room-temperature
plasticity are developed through a deep learning approach. Uncertainty
quantification is performed through a variety of statistical validation

self-reports and interview transcripts from job applicants (N = 2,501) to train
9,702 ML models to predict screening decisions. We found that training data
adverse impact related linearly to ML model adverse impact. However, removing
adverse impact from training data only slightly reduced ML model adverse impact
and tended to negatively affect ML model accuracy. We observed consistent
effects across self-reports and interview transcripts, whether oversampling
real (i.e., bootstrapping) or synthetic observations. As our study relied on
limited predictor sets from one organization, the observed effects on adverse
impact may be attenuated among more accurate ML models.

recommender systems. In recent decades, there have been significant
advancements in latent embedding-based CF methods for improved accuracy, such
as matrix factorization, neural collaborative filtering, and LightGCN. However,
the explainability of these models has not been fully explored. Adding
explainability to recommendation models can not only increase trust in the
decisionmaking process, but also have multiple benefits such as providing
persuasive explanations for item recommendations, creating explicit profiles
for users and items, and assisting item producers in design improvements.
  In this paper, we propose a neat and effective Explainable Collaborative
Filtering (ECF) model that leverages interpretable cluster learning to achieve
the two most demanding objectives: (1) Precise - the model should not
compromise accuracy in the pursuit of explainability; and (2) Self-explainable
- the model's explanations should truly reflect its decision-making process,
not generated from post-hoc methods. The core of ECF is mining taste clusters
from user-item interactions and item profiles.We map each user and item to a
sparse set of taste clusters, and taste clusters are distinguished by a few
representative tags. The user-item preference, users/items' cluster
affiliations, and the generation of taste clusters are jointly optimized in an
end-to-end manner. Additionally, we introduce a forest mechanism to ensure the
model's accuracy, explainability, and diversity. To comprehensively evaluate
the explainability quality of taste clusters, we design several quantitative
metrics, including in-cluster item coverage, tag utilization, silhouette, and
informativeness. Our model's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets.

structure modifies the aerodynamic characteristics and flow properties during
unsteady wing motion, for example, leading-edge vortex (LEV) dynamics, which

We focused on the period between the initial generation of LEVs and subsequent

enhances the lift. The detailed mechanism and its dependence on the angle of

achieves accurate global-position tracking (GPT) for multi-domain bipedal

to the highly complex robot dynamics that are time-varying and hybrid,
especially for multi-domain walking that involves multiple phases/domains of
full actuation, over actuation, and underactuation. To tackle this challenge,
we introduce a continuous-phase GPT control law for multi-domain walking, which
provably ensures the exponential convergence of the entire error state within
the full and over actuation domains and that of the directly regulated error
state within the underactuation domain. We then construct sufficient
multiple-Lyapunov stability conditions for the hybrid multi-domain tracking
error system under the proposed GPT control law. We illustrate the proposed
controller design through both three-domain walking with all motors activated
and two-domain gait with inactive ankle motors. Simulations of a ROBOTIS OP3
bipedal humanoid robot demonstrate the satisfactory accuracy and convergence
rate of the proposed control approach under two different cases of multi-domain
walking as well as various walking speeds and desired paths.

overfitting of existing detection methods to forgery-irrelevant features and
method-specific patterns. The latter is often ignored by previous works. This
paper presents a novel approach to address the two types of overfitting issues
by uncovering common forgery features. Specifically, we first propose a
disentanglement framework that decomposes image information into three distinct
components: forgery-irrelevant, method-specific forgery, and common forgery
features. To ensure the decoupling of method-specific and common forgery
features, a multi-task learning strategy is employed, including a multi-class
classification that predicts the category of the forgery method and a binary
classification that distinguishes the real from the fake. Additionally, a
conditional decoder is designed to utilize forgery features as a condition
along with forgery-irrelevant features to generate reconstructed images.
Furthermore, a contrastive regularization technique is proposed to encourage
the disentanglement of the common and specific forgery features. Ultimately, we
only utilize the common forgery features for the purpose of generalizable
deepfake detection. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework can

active research topic in recent years due to the increasing demand for

watermark detection process and cannot adapt to scenarios that require
processing a large number of images. Although deep learning-based schemes
enable end-to-end watermark embedding and detection, their limited
generalization ability makes them vulnerable to failure in complex scenarios.
In this paper, we propose a carefully crafted watermarking system that can
resist camera shooting. The proposed scheme deals with two important problems:
automatic watermark localization (AWL) and automatic watermark detection (AWD).
AWL automatically identifies the region of interest (RoI), which contains
watermark information, in the camera-shooting image by analyzing the local
statistical characteristics. Meanwhile, AWD extracts the hidden watermark from
the identified RoI after applying perspective correction. Compared with
previous works, the proposed scheme is fully automatic, making it ideal for
application scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is not limited to any
specific watermark embedding strategy, allowing for improvements in the
watermark embedding and extraction procedure. Extensive experimental results

extracted from the camera-shooting image in different scenarios, demonstrating
the superiority and applicability of the proposed approach.

skin-topological effect and the flow of boundary states without chiral or

actuation commands that modify their physical behaviors. The limited resources
in such systems, coupled with their stringent timing constraints, often
prevents the checking of every outgoing command. We present a ""selective
checking"" mechanism that uses game-theoretic modeling to identify the right
subset of commands to be checked in order to deter an adversary. This mechanism
is coupled with a ""delay-aware"" trusted execution environment (TEE) to ensure
that only verified actuation commands are ever sent to the physical system,
thus maintaining their safety and integrity. The selective checking and trusted
execution (SCATE) framework is implemented on an off-the-shelf ARM platform
running standard embedded Linux. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCATE
using four realistic cyber-physical systems (a ground rover, a flight
controller, a robotic arm and an automated syringe pump) and study design
trade-offs. Not only does SCATE provide a high level of security and high
performance, it also suffers from significantly lower overheads (30.48%-47.32%
less) in the process. In fact, SCATE can work with more systems without
negatively affecting the safety of the system. Considering that most CPS do not
have any such checking mechanisms, and SCATE is guaranteed to meet all the
timing requirements (i.e., ensure the safety/integrity of the system), our
methods can significantly improve the security (and, hence, safety) of the
system.

view of poverty at the district level. The project also intends to examine
causation and longitudinal analysis to examine the reasons for poverty. Poverty
and inequality could be widening in developing countries due to demographic and
growth-agglomerating policies. Therefore, targeting the lagging regions and the
vulnerable population is essential to eradicate poverty and improve the quality

it the default in settings where stochastic gradient descent (SGD) performs
poorly. However, our theoretical understanding of this discrepancy is lagging,
preventing the development of significant improvements on either algorithm.
Recent work advances the hypothesis that Adam and other heuristics like
gradient clipping outperform SGD on language tasks because the distribution of
the error induced by sampling has heavy tails. This suggests that Adam
outperform SGD because it uses a more robust gradient estimate. We evaluate
this hypothesis by varying the batch size, up to the entire dataset, to control
for stochasticity. We present evidence that stochasticity and heavy-tailed
noise are not major factors in the performance gap between SGD and Adam.
Rather, Adam performs better as the batch size increases, while SGD is less
effective at taking advantage of the reduction in noise. This raises the
question as to why Adam outperforms SGD in the full-batch setting. Through
further investigation of simpler variants of SGD, we find that the behavior of
Adam with large batches is similar to sign descent with momentum.

activity on the multicellular level plays a key role in the regulation of
physiological pulsatile insulin secretion and is incompletely understood. In
this contribution, we investigate theoretically the principles that give rise
to the synchronized activity of beta cell populations by building up a
phenomenological multicellular model that incorporates the basic features of
beta cell dynamics. Specifically, the model is composed of coupled slow and
fast oscillatory units that reflect metabolic processes and electrical
activity, respectively. Using a realistic description of the intercellular

generates collective rhythmicity and shapes functional beta cell networks. It
turns out that while electrical coupling solely can synchronize the responses,
the addition of metabolic interactions further enhances coordination, the
spatial range of interactions, densifies the functional networks, and ensures a
good consistency with experimental findings. Moreover, our computational
results provide additional insights into the relationship between beta cell

complications arising from it. The majority of patients which present to a
clinic and undergo electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring would be unlikely to
experience seizures during the examination period, thus the presence of
interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) become effective markers for the
diagnosis of epilepsy. Furthermore, IED shapes and patterns are highly variable
across individuals, yet trained experts are still able to identify them through
EEG recordings - meaning that commonalities exist across IEDs that an algorithm
can be trained on to detect and generalise to the larger population. This
research proposes an IED detection system for the binary classification of
epilepsy using scalp EEG recordings. The proposed system features an ensemble
based deep learning method to boost the performance of a residual convolutional
neural network, and a bidirectional long short-term memory network. This is
implemented using raw EEG data, sourced from Temple University Hospital's EEG
Epilepsy Corpus, and is found to outperform the current state of the art model

  Framework",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless communication
systems, adjusting the phase shift of RIS unit cells is crucial for improving
communication performance. Due to massive RIS unit cells, the number of phase
shift parameters fed back from the base station (BS) to the RIS is enormous,
which occupies a large number of frequency resources. In this paper, we propose
a feedback scheme for millimeter-wave RIS phase shift applying a knowledge base
autoencoder framework, in which the learnable knowledge base is shared at the
BS and the RIS. The encoder at the BS compresses the RIS phase shift matrix to
multiple feature vectors. Then the knowledge base vectors index is obtained by
calculating the similarity between feature vectors and knowledge base vectors
and transmitted to the RIS. With utilizing the index at the RIS, the
corresponding knowledge base vectors are extracted and used as the decoder's
inputs to reconstruct the phase shift of the RIS. Simulation results show that
the proposed scheme can significantly improve the accuracy of phase shift
feedback and impressively reduce the amount of RIS phase shift feedback data.
Moreover, the proposed scheme is easy to deploy in actual scenarios due to
lower complexity and fewer parameters.

training domains and unknown target domains. Generating new domains is one of

distribution discrepancy between the generated and target domains.
Distributionally robust optimization is promising to tackle distribution
discrepancy by exploring domains in an uncertainty set. However, the
uncertainty set may be overwhelmingly large, leading to low-confidence
prediction in DG. It is because a large uncertainty set could introduce domains
containing semantically different factors from training domains. To address
this issue, we propose to perform a $\textbf{mo}$derately
$\textbf{d}$istributional $\textbf{e}$xploration (MODE) for domain
generalization. Specifically, MODE performs distribution exploration in an
uncertainty $\textit{subset}$ that shares the same semantic factors with the
training domains. We show that MODE can endow models with provable
generalization performance on unknown target domains. The experimental results
show that MODE achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art

propose a concept of bulk electro-photovoltaic effect, that is, an out-of-plane
external electric-field ($E_{ext}$) can continuously tune in-plane shift
current along with its sign flip in a hetero-nodal-line (HNL) system. While
strong linear optical transition around the nodal-loop may potentially generate
giant shift current, an $E_{ext}$ can effectively control the radius of
nodal-loop, which can continuously modulate the shift-vector components inside
and outside nodal-loop holding opposite signs. This concept has been
demonstrated in the HNL HSnN/MoS$_2$ system using first-principles

can realize a giant bulk electro-photovoltaic effect. Our finding opens new

driving of autonomous vehicles. Currently, many multi-modal fusion methods have
been proposed to improve segmentation accuracy, such as fusing RGB and depth
images. However, we find that when fusing two modals of data with untrustworthy
features, the performance of multi-modal networks could be degraded, even lower
than those using a single modality. In this paper, the untrustworthy features
refer to those extracted from regions (e.g., far objects that are beyond the
depth measurement range) with invalid depth data (i.e., 0 pixel value) in depth
images. The untrustworthy features can confuse the segmentation results, and
hence lead to inferior results. To provide a solution to this issue, we propose
the Adaptive-Mask Fusion Network (AMFNet) by introducing adaptive-weight masks
in the fusion module to fuse features from RGB and depth images with
inconsistency. In addition, we release a large-scale RGB-depth dataset with

consequence of determining the transposition distance of palisades is that,
using as lower bound the one by Bafna and Pevzner, it is impossible to
guarantee approximation ratios lower than $1.375$ when approximating SBT. This

potentially superior to materials designed by intentional doping of the wide

contact and rubbed against another material, almost surely it will be more
effective than its counterpart in collecting negative charges. This simple,
basic property is captured by the so called triboelectric series, where PTFE
ranks extremely high, and that qualitatively orders materials in terms of their
ability to electrostatically charge upon contact and rubbing. However, while
classifying materials, the series does not provide an explanation of their
triboelectric strength, besides a loose correlation with the workfunction.
Indeed, despite being an extremely familiar process, known from centuries,
tribocharging is still elusive and not fully understood. In this work we employ
density functional theory to look for the origin of PTFE tribocharging
strength. We study how charge transfers when pristine or defective PTFE is put
in contact with different clean and oxidised metals. Our results show the
important role played by defects in enhancing charge transfer. Interestingly
and unexpectedly our results show that negatively charged chains are more
stable than neutral ones, if slightly bent. Indeed deformations can be easily
promoted in polymers as PTFE, especially in tribological contacts. These
results suggest that, in designing materials in view of their triboelectric
properties, the characteristics of their defects could be a performance
determining factor.

  Classification","7 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.SD cs.CV cs.LG eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks are a promising tool for Audio Event Classification. In
contrast to other data like natural images, there are many sensible and
non-obvious representations for audio data, which could serve as input to these
models. Due to their black-box nature, the effect of different input
representations has so far mostly been investigated by measuring classification
performance. In this work, we leverage eXplainable AI (XAI), to understand the
underlying classification strategies of models trained on different input
representations. Specifically, we compare two model architectures with regard
to relevant input features used for Audio Event Detection: one directly
processes the signal as the raw waveform, and the other takes in its
time-frequency spectrogram representation. We show how relevance heatmaps
obtained via ""Siren""{Layer-wise Relevance Propagation} uncover
representation-dependent decision strategies. With these insights, we can make
a well-informed decision about the best input representation in terms of
robustness and representativity and confirm that the model's classification
strategies align with human requirements.

segmentation but typically require large-scale datasets with all organs of
interest annotated. However, medical image datasets are often low in sample
size and only partially labeled, i.e., only a subset of organs are annotated.
Therefore, it is crucial to investigate how to learn a unified model on the
available partially labeled datasets to leverage their synergistic potential.
In this paper, we empirically and systematically study the partial-label
segmentation with in-depth analyses on the existing approaches and identify
three distinct types of supervision signals, including two signals derived from
ground truth and one from pseudo label. We propose a novel training framework
termed COSST, which effectively and efficiently integrates comprehensive
supervision signals with self-training. Concretely, we first train an initial
unified model using two ground truth-based signals and then iteratively
incorporate the pseudo label signal to the initial model using self-training.
To mitigate performance degradation caused by unreliable pseudo labels, we
assess the reliability of pseudo labels via outlier detection in latent space
and exclude the most unreliable pseudo labels from each self-training
iteration. Extensive experiments are conducted on six CT datasets for three
partial-label segmentation tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed
COSST achieves significant improvement over the baseline method, i.e.,
individual networks trained on each partially labeled dataset. Compared to the
state-of-the-art partial-label segmentation methods, COSST demonstrates
consistent superior performance on various segmentation tasks and with
different training data size.

programming screencast analysis tool which can automatically extract code-line
editing steps (enter text, delete text, edit text and select text) from
screencasts.Given a programming screencast, our approach outputs a sequence of
coding steps and code snippets involved in each step, which we refer to as

The unconventional and non-axisymmetrical PSF arising from the phase

post-processing techniques. We aim to implement a recently developed
post-processing algorithm, temporal reference analysis of planets (TRAP) on
vAPP coronagraphic data. The property of TRAP that uses non-local training
pixels, combined with the unconventional PSF of vAPP, allows for more
flexibility than previous spatial algorithms in selecting reference pixels to
model systematic noise. Datasets from two types of vAPPs are analysed: a double
grating-vAPP (dgvAPP360) that produces a single symmetric PSF and a
grating-vAPP (gvAPP180) that produces two D-shaped PSFs. We explore how to
choose reference pixels to build temporal systematic noise models in TRAP for
them. We then compare the performance of TRAP with previously implemented
algorithms that produced the best signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in companion

D-shaped PSFs is not as temporally associated as expected. Conversely, there is
still a significant number of systematic noise sources that are shared by the
dark hole and the bright side in the same PSF. We should choose reference
pixels from the same PSF when reducing the dgvAPP360 dataset or the gvAPP180
dataset with TRAP. In these datasets, TRAP achieves results consistent with
previous best detections, with an improved S/N for the gvAPP180 dataset.

transitions, investigations on realistic, or non-chiral cases are vital. Here
we employ momentum-space QMC method to investigate the evolution of correlated
states in magic-angle TBG away from chiral limit at charge neutrality with
polarized spin/valley, which approximates to an experimental case with filling
factor $\nu=-3$. We find that the ground state evolves from quatum anomalous
Hall insulator into an intriguing correlated semi-metallic state as AA hopping
strength reaches experimental values. Such a state resembles the recently
proposed heavy-fermion representations with localized electrons residing at AA
stacking regions and delocalized electrons itinerating via AB/BA stacking
regions. The spectral signatures of the localized and itinerant electrons in
the heavy-fermion semimetal phase are revealed, with the connection to
experimental results being discussed.

importantly, while more and more companies and institutions release their LLMs,
the origin can be hard to trace. Since LLMs are heading towards the time of
AGI, similar to the origin tracing in anthropology, it is of great importance
to trace the origin of LLMs. In this paper, we first raise the concern of the
origin tracing of LLMs and propose an effective method to trace and detect
AI-generated contexts. We introduce a novel algorithm that leverages the
contrastive features between LLMs and extracts model-wise features to trace the
text origins. Our proposed method works under both white-box and black-box
settings therefore can be widely generalized to detect various LLMs.(e.g. can
be generalized to detect GPT-3 models without the GPT-3 models). Also, our
proposed method requires only limited data compared with the supervised

construct extensive experiments to examine whether we can trace the origins of

Nevertheless, the situation was largely different between countries. While some

sensitivity of matrix functions to perturbations, which is measured by
condition numbers. However, the condition number itself might not be computed
exactly as well due to round-off and errors in the input. The sensitivity of
the condition number is measured by the so-called level-2 condition number. For
the usual (level-1) condition number, it is well-known that structured
condition numbers (i.e., where only perturbations are taken into account that
preserve the structure of the input matrix) might be much smaller than
unstructured ones, which, e.g., suggests that structure-preserving algorithms

intelligence is mankind's ability to perform relational reasoning: the
comparison of different objects, measuring similarity, grasping of relations
between objects and the converse, figuring out the odd one out in a set of
objects. Mankind can even do this with objects they have never seen before.
Here we show how ClusterFlow, a semi-supervised hierarchical clustering
framework can operate on trained NNs utilising the rich multi-dimensional class
and feature data found at the pre-SoftMax layer to build a hyperspacial map of
classes/features and this adds more human-like functionality to modern deep
convolutional neural networks. We demonstrate this with 3 tasks. 1. the
statistical learning based `mistakes' made by infants when attending to images
of cats and dogs. 2. improving both the resilience to hacking images and the
accurate measure of certainty in deep-NNs. 3. Relational reasoning over sets of
images, including those not known to the NN nor seen before. We also
demonstrate that ClusterFlow can work on non-NN data and deal with missing data
by testing it on a Chemistry dataset. This work suggests that modern deep NNs
can be made more human-like without re-training of the NNs. As it is known that
some methods used in deep and convolutional NNs are not biologically plausible
or perhaps even the best approach: the ClusterFlow framework can sit on top of
any NN and will be a useful tool to add as NNs are improved in this regard.

(ICF), which was regarded as a great milestone for high-gain laser fusion
energy. In the burning plasma, alpha particles incident on the cryogenic (warm
dense) fuels cannot be simply regarded as single particles, and the new physics
brought about by the density effects of alpha particles should be considered.
In this work, the collective interaction between them has been considered,
namely the effect of the superposition of wake waves. The stopping power of
alpha-particle clusters, i.e. the rate of energy loss per unit distance
traveled has been calculated using both analytical and simulation approaches.
In theory, we obtain the stopping power of alpha clusters in cryogenic (warm
dense) fuel by the dielectric function method, which illustrates the importance
of the effective interaction between particles. Simulation results using the
LAPINS code show that the collective stopping power of the alpha cluster is
indeed increased via coherent superposition of excitation fields (the
excitation of high-amplitude wake waves). However, the comparison between
simulation and theoretical results also illustrates a coherent-decoherent
transition of the stopping power of the cluster. The initial conditions with
various sizes and densities of the alpha clusters have been considered to
verify the condition of decoherence transition. Our work provides a theoretical
description of the transport properties of high-density alpha particles in warm
dense cryogenic fuel and might give some theoretical guidance for the design of
actual fusion processes.

energy system from traditional hierarchical energy delivery paradigm to a

liberalization in the energy sector, giving rise to possible energy trading
among networked local energy hub. Joint operation of such hubs can improve
energy efficiency and support the integration of renewable energy resource.
Acknowledging peer-to-peer trading between hubs, their optimal operation within
the network can maximize consumption of locally produced energy. However, for
such complex systems involving multiple stakeholders, both computational
tractability and privacy concerns need to be accounted for. We investigate both
decentralized and centralized model predictive control (MPC) approaches for a
network of energy hubs. While the centralized control strategy offers superior
performance to the decentralized method, its implementation is computationally
prohibitive and raises privacy concerns, as the information of each hub has to
be shared extensively. On the other hand, a classical decentralized control
approach can ease the implementation at the expense of sub-optimal performance
of the overall system. In this work, a distributed scheme based on a consensus
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is proposed. It
combines the performance of the centralized approach with the privacy
preservation of decentralized approach. A novel multi-horizon MPC framework is
also introduced to increase the prediction horizon without compromising the
time discretization or making the problem computationally intractable. A
benchmark three-hub network is used to compare the performance of the mentioned
methods. The results show superior performance in terms of total cost,
computational time, robustness to demand and prices variations.

particular, we show that the main features of the imaginary part of the
dielectric function $\epsilon_2(\omega)$ at $\sim$380 and 630 cm$^{-1}$ are
related to the motions of threefold coordinated oxygen atoms, which are the
vast majority of oxygen atoms in am-Al$_2$O$_3$. Our analysis provides an
alternative point of view with respect to an earlier suggested assignment of
the vibrational modes, which relates them to the stretching and bending
vibrational modes of AlO$_{n}$ ($n=$ 4, 5, and 6) polyhedra. Our assignment is
based on the additive decomposition of the VDOS and $\epsilon_2(\omega)$
spectra, which shows that: (i) the band at $\sim$380 cm$^{-1}$ features oxygen
motions occurring in a direction normal to the plane defined by the three
nearest-neighbor aluminum atoms, i.e. out-of-plane motions of oxygen atoms;
(ii) Al--O stretching vibrations (i.e. in-plane motions of oxygen atoms) appear
at frequencies above $\sim$500 cm$^{-1}$, which characterize the vibrational
modes underlying the band at $\sim$630 cm$^{-1}$. Aluminum and fourfold
coordinated oxygen atoms contribute uniformly to the VDOS and
$\epsilon_2(\omega)$ spectra in the frequency region $\sim$350--650 cm$^{-1}$
without causing specific features. Our numerical results are in good agreement
with the previous and presently obtained experimental data on the IR dielectric
function of am-Al$_2$O$_3$ films. Finally, we show that the IR spectrum can be
modeled by assuming isotropic Born charges for aluminum atoms and fourfold

UV-divergences, which are regulated by a point-splitting regulator.
Renormalizing the operators requires multiplicative factors depending on the

$|q|^{-\frac{q^2}{\pi|\Lambda|}}$, where $q$ is the momentum and $1/|\Lambda|$

which brings multi-view point clouds of arbitrary scene into simultaneous

alignment of multi-view point clouds via Bayesian optimization, where
registration problem is modeled as a Gaussian process over hand-eye relation
and the covariance function is modified to be compatible with distance metric
in 3-D motion space SE(3), then passes the initial guess of hand-eye relation
to an Anderson Accelerated ICP variant for later fine registration and accurate
calibration. RegHEC has little requirement on calibration object, it is
applicable with sphere, cone, cylinder and even simple plane, which can be
quite challenging for correct point cloud registration and sensor motion
estimation using existing methods. While suitable for most 3-D vision guided

$-U<0$, while each particle has a positive activation energy $\Delta>0$. The

the set of configurations where all the droplets are subcritical. Our goal is
to describe, in the metastable regime $\Delta\in(U,2U)$ and in the limit as
$\beta\to\infty$, how and when the system nucleates.
  In the first paper we showed that subcritical droplets behave as quasi-random

how subcritical droplets form and dissolve on multiple space-time scales when
the volume is moderately large, i.e., $|\Lambda_\beta|=\mathrm e^{\Theta\beta}$
with $\Delta<\Theta<2\Delta-U$. In the third paper we consider the setting
where the volume is very large, namely, $|\Lambda_\beta|=\mathrm
e^{\Theta\beta}$ with $\Delta<\Theta<\Gamma-(2\Delta-U)$, where $\Gamma$ is the
energy of the critical droplet in the local model with fixed volume, and use
the results in the first two papers to identify the nucleation time. We will
see that in a very large volume critical droplets appear more or less
independently in boxes of moderate volume, a phenomenon referred to as
homogeneous nucleation.
  Since Kawasaki dynamics is conservative, i.e., particles are preserved, we
need to control non-local effects in the way droplets are formed and dissolved.
This is done via a deductive approach: the tube of typical trajectories leading
to nucleation is described via a series of events on which the evolution of the

address this shortcoming in the machine learning ecosystem, we introduce
DataComp, a benchmark where the training code is fixed and researchers innovate
by proposing new training sets. We provide a testbed for dataset experiments
centered around a new candidate pool of 12.8B image-text pairs from Common
Crawl. Participants in our benchmark design new filtering techniques or curate
new data sources and then evaluate their new dataset by running our
standardized CLIP training code and testing on 38 downstream test sets. Our
benchmark consists of multiple scales, with four candidate pool sizes and
associated compute budgets ranging from 12.8M to 12.8B samples seen during
training. This multi-scale design facilitates the study of scaling trends and
makes the benchmark accessible to researchers with varying resources.
  Our baseline experiments show that the DataComp workflow is a promising way
of improving multimodal datasets. We introduce DataComp-1B, a dataset created
by applying a simple filtering algorithm to the 12.8B candidate pool. The
resulting 1.4B subset enables training a CLIP ViT-L/14 from scratch to 79.2%
zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet. Our new ViT-L/14 model outperforms a larger
ViT-g/14 trained on LAION-2B by 0.7 percentage points while requiring 9x less

points, which is trained with the same compute budget as our model. These gains
highlight the potential for improving model performance by carefully curating
training sets. We view DataComp-1B as only the first step and hope that

disease infection rate that can describe the spatio-temporal variations of the
disease dynamic when dealing with small areal units. Such a model must be
flexible, realistic, and general enough to describe jointly the multiple areal
processes in a time of rapid interventions and irregular government policies.
We develop a joint Poisson Auto-Regression model that incorporates both
temporal and spatial dependence to characterize the individual dynamics while
borrowing information among adjacent areas. The dependence is captured by two
sets of space-time random effects governing the process growth rate and
baseline, but the specification is general enough to include the effect of
covariates to explain changes in both terms. This provides a framework for
evaluating local policy changes over the whole spatial and temporal domain of
the study. Adopted in a fully Bayesian framework and implemented through a
novel sparse-matrix representation in Stan, the model has been validated
through a substantial simulation study. We apply the model on the weekly
Covid-19 cases observed in the different local authority regions in England
between May 2020 and March 2021. We consider two alternative sets of
covariates: the level of local restrictions in place and the value of the
\textit{Google Mobility Indices}. The model detects substantial spatial and
temporal heterogeneity in the disease reproduction rate, possibly due to policy
changes or other factors. The paper also formalizes various novel model based
investigation methods for assessing aspects of disease epidemiology.

prime targets for searching for rocky planets in habitable zones. Consequently,
a detailed characterization of these stars is in demand. The spectral sub-type
is one of the parameters that is used for the characterization and it is
traditionally derived from the observed spectra. However, obtaining the spectra
of M dwarfs is expensive in terms of observation time and resources due to
their intrinsic faintness. We study the performance of four machine-learning
(ML) models: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Probabilistic Random
Forest (PRF), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), in identifying the spectral
sub-types of M dwarfs at a grand scale by deploying broadband photometry in the
optical and near-infrared. We trained the ML models by using the
spectroscopically identified M dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data
Release (SDSS) 7, together with their photometric colors that were derived from
the SDSS, Two-Micron All-Sky Survey, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer.
We found that the RF, PRF, and MLP give a comparable prediction accuracy, 74%,
while the KNN provides slightly lower accuracy, 71%. We also found that these
models can predict the spectral sub-type of M dwarfs with ~99% accuracy within
+/-1 sub-type. The five most useful features for the prediction are r-z, r-i,
r-J, r-H, and g-z, and hence lacking data in all SDSS bands substantially
reduces the prediction accuracy. However, we can achieve an accuracy of over
70% when the r and i magnitudes are available. Since the stars in this study
are nearby (d~1300 pc for 95% of the stars), the dust extinction can reduce the
prediction accuracy by only 3%. Finally, we used our optimized RF models to
predict the spectral sub-types of M dwarfs from the Catalog of Cool Dwarf
Targets for TESS, and we provide the optimized RF models for public use.

high-contrast images. However, these techniques are noise-intolerance and
suffer from the multiple extrema problem which arises when the scene contains
more noisy events than structure, causing the contrast to be higher at multiple
locations. This makes the task of estimating the camera motion extremely
challenging, which is a problem for neuromorphic earth observation, because,
without a proper estimation of the motion parameters, it is not possible to
generate a map with high contrast, causing important details to be lost.
Similar methods that use CMax addressed this problem by changing or augmenting
the objective function to enable it to converge to the correct motion
parameters. Our proposed solution overcomes the multiple extrema and
noise-intolerance problems by correcting the warped event before calculating
the contrast and offers the following advantages: it does not depend on the
event data, it does not require a prior about the camera motion, and keeps the
rest of the CMax pipeline unchanged. This is to ensure that the contrast is
only high around the correct motion parameters. Our approach enables the
creation of better motion-compensated maps through an analytical compensation
technique using a novel dataset from the International Space Station (ISS).

multiprocessor systems for minimizing the overall completion time (or
makespan). Moldable job scheduling has been widely studied in the literature,
in particular when tasks have dependencies (i.e., task graphs) or when tasks
are released on-the-fly (i.e., online). However, few studies have focused on
both (i.e., online scheduling of moldable task graphs). In this paper, we
design a new online scheduling algorithm for this problem and derive constant
competitive ratios under several common yet realistic speedup models (i.e.,
roofline, communication, Amdahl, and a general combination). These results
improve the ones we have shown in the preliminary version of this paper. We
also prove, for each speedup model, a lower bound on the competitiveness of any
online list scheduling algorithm that allocates processors to a task based only
on the task's parameters and not on its position in the graph. This lower bound
matches exactly the competitive ratio of our algorithm for the roofline,
communication and Amdahl's model, and is close to the ratio for the general
model. Finally, we provide a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any
deterministic online algorithm for the arbitrary speedup model, which is not
constant but depends on the number of tasks in the longest path of the graph.

coupling of all fundamental fields to gravity, together with its dominance on
large scales, makes gravitational physics a rich laboratory to study
fundamental physics. This holds especially true for the search for the elusive
dark photon, a promising dark matter candidate. The dark photon is predicted to
generate instabilities in a rotating black hole spacetime, birthing a
macroscopic Bose-Einstein condensate. These condensates can especially form
around super massive black holes, modifying the dynamical inspiralling process.
This then opens another window to leverage future space-borne gravitational
wave antennas to join the hunt for the elusive dark matter particle. This study
builds a preliminary model for the gravitational waveform emitted by such a
dressed extreme mass-ratio inspiral. Comparing these waveforms to the vacuum
scenario allows projections to the potential constrainability on the dark
photon mass by space-borne gravitational wave antennas. The superradiant
instability of a massive vector field on a Kerr background is calculated and
the modification to the dynamics of an inspiralling solar mass-scale compact

(DL)-based radar echo extrapolation algorithms are more effective and
efficient. However, the development of highly reliable and generalized
algorithms is hindered by three main bottlenecks: cumulative error spreading,
imprecise representation of sparse echo distribution, and inaccurate
description of non-stationary motion process. To address these issues, this
paper presents a novel radar echo extrapolation algorithm that utilizes

algorithm extracts features from multi-frame echo images that accurately
represent non-stationary motion processes for precipitation prediction. The
proposed algorithm uses a novel parallel encoder based on Transformer

adopted to enhance the ability to perceive global-local information and

still a problem. However, the issue of capturing the temporal-topological
coupling features under the human semantic segmentation task prevents previous
advanced segmentation methods (e.g PointNet, PointCNN, Point Transformer) from
being well utilized in practical scenarios. To address the challenge caused by
the sparsity and temporal-topological feature of the data, we (i) introduce

where one dominant modality propagates falsehoods while other modalities have
little or no influence. We show that AMM adds noise to the training and

image-only detectors can seemingly outperform their multimodal counterparts on
an inherently multimodal task. To address this issue, we collect and curate
FIGMENTS, a robust evaluation benchmark for CMM, which consists of real world

symmetry breaking (SSB) of the $O(N)$ symmetry down to $O(N-1)$ results in the
vacuum manifold $S^{N-1}$, together with a perturbed scalar potential in the
presence of a small explicit symmetry breaking (ESB) interaction. The $O(2)$
model is equivalent to the axion model admitting topological global (axion)
strings attached by $N_{\rm DW}$ domain walls. We point out for the $N_{\rm DW}

ensured by sequential SSBs $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^2 \to \mathbb{Z}_2 \to 1$, where the
first SSB occurs in the vacuum leading to the topological domain wall as a
mother soliton, only inside which the second SSB occurs giving rise to a
subsequent kink inside the mother wall. From the bulk viewpoint, this kink is
identical to a global string as a daughter soliton. This observation can be
naturally extended to the $O(3)$ model, where a global monopole as a daughter
soliton appears as a kink in a mother string or as a vortex on a mother domain
wall, depending on ESB interactions. In the most generic case, the stability of
the composite system consisting of the monopole, string, and domain wall is
understood by the SSB $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3 \to (\mathbb{Z}_2)^2 \to \mathbb{Z}_2
\to 1$, in which the first SSB at the vacuum gives rise to the domain wall
triggering the second one, so that the daughter string appears as a domain wall
inside the mother wall triggering the third SSB, which leads to a granddaughter
monopole as a kink inside the daughter vortex. We demonstrate numerical

  In this paper, we present a static type system for strategy languages. We
combine a structural type system capturing how rewrite strategies transform the

all possible legal strategy execution paths. Our type system raises warnings
when parts of a composition are guaranteed to fail at runtime, and errors when
no legal execution for a strategy is possible. We present a formalization of
our strategy language and novel tracing type system, and formally prove its

remote-sensing instruments on board the spacecraft acquired scientific data
during three observing windows surrounding the perihelion of the first orbit of
this phase. The aim of the analysis is the detection of magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) wave modes in an active region by exploiting the capabilities of
spectropolarimetric measurements. The High Resolution Telescope (HRT) of the
Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) on board the Solar Orbiter
acquired a high-cadence data set of an active region. This is studied in the
paper. B-$\omega$ and phase-difference analyses are applied on line-of-sight
velocity and circular polarization maps and other averaged quantities. We find
that several MHD modes at different frequencies are excited in all analysed
structures. The leading sunspot shows a linear dependence of the phase lag on
the angle between the magnetic field and the line of sight of the observer in
its penumbra. The magnetic pore exhibits global resonances at several
frequencies, which are also excited by different wave modes. The SO/PHI
measurements clearly confirm the presence of magnetic and velocity oscillations
that are compatible with one or more MHD wave modes in pores and a sunspot.
Improvements in modelling are still necessary to interpret the relation between
the fluctuations of different diagnostics.

which, along with the known transients in our fields, allowed us to estimate
that at least 2.1 per cent of radio sources are varying at 1.28 GHz at the
sampled cadence and sensitivity, in line with previous work. We provide the
full catalogue of these sources, the largest of candidate radio variables to
date. Transient sources found with archival counterparts include a pulsar

known stellar flares and X-ray binary jets in our observations. Data from the
MeerLICHT optical telescope, along with estimates of long time-scale
variability induced by scintillation, imply that the majority of the new
variables are active galactic nuclei. This tells us that citizen scientists can
discover phenomena varying on time-scales from weeks to several years. The
success both in terms of volunteer engagement and scientific merit warrants the
continued development of the project, whilst we use the classifications from

angular momentum of the ISCO also decreases with an increase in $A_\lambda$.
Based on these findings, we then explore the periodic orbits of the polymer

results show that the rational numbers increase with the energy of particles
and decrease with the increase of angular momentum based on a classification

in a polymer black hole in LQG consistently have lower energy, providing a
potential method for distinguishing a polymer black hole in LQG from a
Schwarzschild black hole. Finally, we also examine the gravitational wave
radiations of the periodic orbits of a test object which orbits a supermassive
polymer black hole in LQG, which generates intricate GW waveforms that can aid
in exhibiting the gravitational structure of the system.

Existing API search research cannot meet these pragmatic needs because they are

through intent clarification to query results promoting divergent thinking
about results. This paper designs a novel Knowledge-Aware Human-AI Dialog agent

query through multi-round question answering and recommends APIs for the
clarified query with relevance explanation and extended suggestions (e.g.,
alternative, collaborating or opposite-function APIs). We systematically
evaluate KAHAID. In terms of human-AI dialogue efficiency, it achieves a high

a resurgence of papers detailing methods for estimating conversion gain in both
the sub-electron and multi-electron read noise regimes. Each of the proposed
methods work from identical noise models but nevertheless yield diverse
procedures for estimating conversion gain. Here, an overview of the proposed
methods is provided along with an investigation into their assumptions,
uncertainty, and measurement requirements. A sensitivity analysis is conducted
using synthetic data for a variety of different sensor configurations.
Specifically, the dependence of the conversion gain estimate uncertainty on the
magnitude of read noise and quanta exposure is explored. Guidance into the
trade-offs between the different methods is provided so that experimenters

the solar-activity cycle has gained increasing attention. The works proposing
physical mechanisms of planetary action via tidal forcing have in common that
quasi-alignments between Venus, Earth, and Jupiter (V-E-J configurations) would
provide a basic periodicity of $\approx 11.0$ years able to synchronize the
operation of solar dynamo with these planetary configurations. Nevertheless,
the evidence behind this particular tidal forcing is still controversial. In
this context we develop, for the first time, the complete Sun's tide-generating
potential (STGP) in terms of a harmonic series, where the effects of different
planets on the STGP are clearly separated and identified. We use a modification
of the spectral analysis method devised by Kudryavtsev (J. Geodesy. 77, 829,
2004; Astron. Astrophys. 471, 1069, 2007b) that permits to expand any function
of planetary coordinates to a harmonic series over long time intervals. We
build a catalog of 713 harmonic terms able to represent the STGP with a high
degree of precision. We look for tidal forcings related to V-E-J configurations
and specifically the existence of periodicities around $11.0$ years.
  Although the obtained tidal periods range from $\approx$ 1000 years to 1
week, we do not find any $\approx$ 11.0 years period. The V-E-J configurations
do not produce any significant tidal term at this or other periods. The Venus
tidal interaction is absent in the 11-year spectral band, which is dominated by
Jupiter's orbital motion. The planet that contributes the most to the STGP in
three planets configurations, along with Venus and Earth, is Saturn. An
$\approx 11.0$ years tidal period with a direct physical relevance on the
11-year-like solar-activity cycle is highly improbable.

significantly along the line-of-sight (LoS) due to the light-cone (LC) effect.
It is important to accurately incorporate this in simulations in order to
correctly interpret the signal. 21-cm LC simulations are typically produced by
stitching together slices from a finite number $(N_{\rm RS})$ of ''reionization
snapshot'', each corresponding to a different stage of reionization. In this
paper, we have quantified the errors in the 21-cm LC simulation due to the
finite value of $N_{\rm RS}$. We show that this can introduce large
discontinuities $(> 200 \%)$ at the stitching boundaries when $N_{\rm RS}$ is
small $(= 2,4)$ and the mean neutral fraction jumps by $\delta \bar{x}_{\rm HI}
= 0.2,0.1$ respectively at the stitching boundaries. This drops to $17 \%$ for
$N_{\rm RS} = 13$ where $\delta \bar{x}_{\rm HI}=0.02$. We present and also
validate a method for mitigating this error by increasing $N_{\rm RS}$ without
a proportional increase in the computational costs which are mainly incurred in
generating the dark matter and halo density fields. Our method generates these
fields only at a few redshifts, and interpolates them to generate reionization
snapshots at closely spaced redshifts. We use this to generate 21-cm LC
simulations with $N_{\rm RS} = 26,51,101$ and $201$, and show that the errors

  Application to Turbulent Flows",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generally, reduced order models of fluid flows are obtained by projecting the
Navier-Stokes equations onto a reduced subspace spanned by vector functions
that carry the meaningful information of the dynamics. A common method to
generate such subspace is the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. This projection
strategy is intrusive since it assumes that the approximation model used to
solve the high fidelity flow problem is known and accessible. In the present
article, we propose a non-intrusive paradigm based on Machine Learning to build
Closed Parametric Reduced Order Models (ML-PROM) relevant to fluid dynamics.
With no prior knowledge requirement of the approximation model, this method is
purely data-driven as it operates directly on data regardless their origin,
DNS, RANS simulations or experiment. The key idea to build the ML-CPROM is to
use the generally known form of Galerkin ROMs and assimilate the time
variations of the temporal POD modes to a nonlinear quadratic form taking a
closure right hand side member. This last term is introduced to account for
uncaptured dynamics due to data noise, POD truncation errors and time
integration schemes. For parameter variation, the ML-CPROM is updated by
interpolation on the quotient manifold of the set of fixed rank matrices by the
orthogonal group. The predicted closure term is afterwards calculated by a
Long-Short-Term-Memory neural network. We assess the potential of the proposed
approach on the parametric examples of the lid-driven cavity flow and the flow
past a cylinder by varying the Reynolds number through the viscosity, and the
Ahmed-Body flow by varying the geometry through the rear slant angle. We show
on these examples that our method enables to recover the dynamics with a good
accuracy, not only for the training parameter points, but also for unseen
parameter values for which the model was not priory trained.

fault-tolerant $(2k-1)$-spanner of $G$. The bottleneck is the large query time
due to the size of any such spanner, which is $\Omega(n^{1+1/k})$ under the
Erd\H{o}s girth conjecture. Bil\`o et al. [STOC 2023] gave a solution with
stretch $3+\varepsilon$, query time $O(n^{\alpha})$ but space
$O(n^{2-\frac{\alpha}{f+1}})$, approaching the quadratic barrier for large
sensitivity. In the realm of subquadratic space, our $f$-DSOs are the first
ones that guarantee, at the same time, large sensitivity, low stretch, and
non-trivial query time. To obtain our results, we use the approximate distance

representations of 3D scenes and achieve high accuracy in autonomous driving
tasks. However, the space-inefficiency of methods that use point-wise
representations limits their development and usage in practical applications.
In particular, scan-submap matching and global map representation methods are
restricted by the inefficiency of nearest neighbor searching (NNS) for
large-volume point clouds. To improve space-time efficiency, we propose a novel
method of describing scenes using quadric surfaces, which are far more compact
representations of 3D objects than conventional point clouds. In contrast to
point cloud-based methods, our quadric representation-based method decomposes a
3D scene into a collection of sparse quadric patches, which improves storage
efficiency and avoids the slow point-wise NNS process. Our method first
segments a given point cloud into patches and fits each of them to a quadric
implicit function. Each function is then coupled with other geometric
descriptors of the patch, such as its center position and covariance matrix.
Collectively, these patch representations fully describe a 3D scene, which can
be used in place of the original point cloud and employed in LiDAR odometry,
mapping and localization algorithms. We further design a novel incremental
growing method for quadric representations, which eliminates the need to
repeatedly re-fit quadric surfaces from the original point cloud. Extensive
odometry, mapping and localization experiments on large-volume point clouds in
the KITTI and UrbanLoco datasets demonstrate that our method maintains low
latency and memory utility while achieving competitive, and even superior,
accuracy.

(ASD) have low employment rates and major difficulties in maintaining
occupation (Hendricks, 2010). Adopting smart and interactive technology,
promoted by Industry 4.0, can be a valid solution to improve social inclusion
in the workplace. The present work describes the design and development process
of the multimodal device (A)MICO (acronym for 'A Multimodal device to improve
inclusive Interaction between Cobot and Operator'), aimed to improve the user
experience of ASD workers interacting with collaborative robots (cobots) in
production lines. (A)MICO proposes a new intuitive mode of communication in
which information about the cobot activity is transferred through acoustic and
visual feedback. Lights and sounds are designed to make the user aware of the
cobot's activity and gain control of the situation. To define the optimal
feedback configuration, a co-design process has been performed involving five
users with high functioning autism (HFA). The inclusion of users with HFA in
the design process allows to analyse the system from different perspectives and
increase the acceptance of the final product (Francis et al., 2009). In
addition, (A)MICO is designed to be integrated into a pre-existing cobot system
and its feedback can be customized making job tasks more human-friendly and
accessible to all. To achieve this purpose, Design for All principles were
taken into consideration since the preliminary stages of the study, in order to
develop a device that could represent a valuable aid in improving the
well-being and productivity for both neurotypical and neurodiverse users.

for answering the fundamental question of when and where in the disks rocky
planets like our own form. However, the thermal structure of the inner few au
of the disks is poorly understood not only because of lack of observational
constraints but also because of the uncertainty of accretion heating processes.
Here, we propose thermal tomography of the inner regions of protoplanetary
disks with the ngVLA and ALMA. The proposed approach is based on the assumption
that the inner disk regions are optically thick at submillimeter wavelengths
but are marginally optically thin at longer millimeter wavelengths. By
combining high-resolution millimeter continuum images from the ngVLA with
submillimeter images at comparable resolutions from ALMA, we will be able to
reconstruct the radial and vertical structure of the inner few au disk regions.
We demonstrate that the thermal tomography we propose can be used to constrain
the efficiency of midplane accretion heating, a process that controls the
timing of snow-line migration to the rocky planet-forming region, in the few au
regions of protoplanetary disks at a distance of 140 pc.

single aperture coronagraph with wavefront correction via extreme adaptive
optics. Such systems are limited to observing beyond an inner working (IWA) of
a few $\mathit\lambda/D$. Nulling interferometry with two or more apertures
will enable detections of companions at separations at and beyond the formal
diffraction limit.
  Aims: This paper evaluates the astrophysical potential of a kernel-nuller as
the prime high-contrast imaging mode of the Very Large Telescope Interferometer
(VLTI).
  Methods: By taking into account baseline projection effects which are induced
by Earth rotation, we introduce some diversity in the response of the nuller as
a function of time. This response is depicted by transmission maps. We also
determine whether we can extract the astrometric parameters of a companion from
the kernel outputs, which are the primary intended observable quantities of the
kernel-nuller. This then leads us to comment on the characteristics of a
possible observing program for the discovery of exoplanets.
  Results: We present transmission maps for both the raw nuller outputs and
their subsequent kernel outputs. To further examine the properties of the
kernel-nuller, we introduce maps of the absolute value of the kernel output. We
also identify 38 targets for the direct detection of exoplanets with a
kernel-nuller at the focus of the VLTI.
  Conclusions: With continued upgrades of the VLTI infrastructure that will
reduce fringe tracking residuals, a kernel-nuller would enable the detection of
young giant exoplanets at separations < 10 AU, where radial velocity and
transit methods are more sensitive.

the twelve-fold quasicrystals most commonly found in soft matter. We propose
design criteria for block copolymers such that quasicrystal-friendly length
scales emerge at the point of phase separation from a melt, basing our

families: linear chains containing two different monomer types in blocks of
different lengths, and ABC star terpolymers. In all examples, we are able to
identify parameter windows with the two length scales having a ratio of 1.93.

a monodisperse A_L B A_S B melt and, second, a model based on random reactions
from a mixture of A_L, A_S and B chains: both feature the length scale ratio of

nickelates also have great application potential. The anisotropy of
$H_{\rm{c2}}$ monotonically decreases from $\sim$ 10 near $T_{\rm{c}}$ to
$\sim$ 1.5 at 2 K. Angle dependence of $H_{\rm{c2}}$ confirms the crossover of
superconductivity from two-dimensional (2D) to three-dimensional (3D) as the
temperature decreases. We discussed that the interstitial orbital effect causes
the weakening of anisotropy. The observed abnormal upturning of $H_{\rm{c2}}$

quality and rare earth elements. Therefore, it should not be the

UV photons, a mechanism which is prone to instabilities, causing the wind to be
clumpy. The clumpy structure hampers wind mass-loss estimates, limiting our
understanding of massive star evolution. The wind structure also impacts
accretion in high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) systems. We analyse the
wavelength-dependent variability of X-ray absorption in the wind to study its
structure. Such an approach is possible in HMXBs, where the compact object
serves as an X-ray backlight. We probe different parts of the wind by analysing
data taken at superior and inferior conjunction. We apply excess variance
spectroscopy to study the wavelength-dependent soft X-ray variability of the
HMXB Cygnus X-1 in the low/hard spectral state. Excess variance spectroscopy
quantifies the variability of an object above the statistical noise as a
function of wavelength, which allows us to study the variability of individual
spectral lines. As one of the first studies, we apply this technique to
high-resolution gratings spectra provided by Chandra, accounting for various
systematic effects. The frequency dependence is investigated by changing the
time binning. The strong orbital phase dependence we observe in the excess
variance is consistent with column density variations predicted by a simple
model for a clumpy wind. We identify spikes of increased variability with
spectral features found by previous spectroscopic analyses of the same data
set, most notably from silicon in over-dense clumps in the wind. In the silicon
line region, the variability power is redistributed towards lower frequencies,
hinting at increased line variability in large clumps. In prospect of the
microcalorimetry missions that are scheduled to launch within the next decade,
excess variance spectra present a promising approach to constrain the wind
structure.

consider $\mathcal F_U$, the restriction of $\mathcal F$ to $U$ and the

technique to verify the impact of an update on the execution time of embedded
software. Timing analysis is computationally expensive and labor intensive.
Software updates render repeating the analysis from scratch a waste of
resources and time, because their impact is inherently confined. To determine
this boundary, in RETA we apply a slicing procedure that identifies all
relevant code segments and a statement categorization that determines how to
analyze each such line of code. We adapt a subset of RETA for integration into
aiT, an industrial timing analysis tool, and also develop a complete
implementation in a tool called DELTA. Based on staple benchmarks and realistic
code updates from official repositories, we test the accuracy by analyzing the
worst-case execution time (WCET) before and after an update, comparing the
measures with the use of the unmodified aiT as well as real executions on
embedded hardware. DELTA returns WCET information that ranges from exactly the
WCET of real hardware to 148% of the new version's measured WCET. With the same
benchmarks, the unmodified aiT estimates are 112% and 149% of the actual
executions; therefore, even when DELTA is pessimistic, an industry-strength
tool such as aiT cannot do better. Crucially, we also show that RETA decreases
aiT's analysis time by 45% and its memory consumption by 8.9%, whereas removing
RETA from DELTA, effectively rendering it a regular timing analysis tool,
increases its analysis time by 27%.

ability of the model and has a bright future. Existing self-distillation
methods either require additional models, model modification, or batch size
expansion for training, which increases the difficulty of use, memory
consumption, and computational cost. This paper developed Self-discipline on
multiple channels(SMC), which combines consistency regularization with
self-distillation using the concept of multiple channels. Conceptually, SMC
consists of two steps: 1) each channel data is simultaneously passed through
the model to obtain its corresponding soft label, and 2) the soft label saved
in the previous step is read together with the soft label obtained from the
current channel data through the model to calculate the loss function. SMC uses
consistent regularization and self-distillation to improve the generalization
ability of the model and the robustness of the model to noisy labels. We named
the SMC containing only two channels as SMC-2. Comparative experimental results
on both datasets show that SMC-2 outperforms Label Smoothing Regularizaion and
Self-distillation From The Last Mini-batch on all models, and outperforms the
state-of-the-art Sharpness-Aware Minimization method on 83% of the
models.Compatibility of SMC-2 and data augmentation experimental results show
that using both SMC-2 and data augmentation improves the generalization ability
of the model between 0.28% and 1.80% compared to using only data augmentation.
Ultimately, the results of the label noise interference experiments show that
SMC-2 curbs the tendency that the model's generalization ability decreases in
the late training period due to the interference of label noise. The code is

instantaneous channel state information (CSI), indicating that decisions must
be made every transmission time interval (TTI) which lasts at most several
milliseconds. Only quite simple approaches can be exploited under this
stringent time constraint, resulting in less than satisfactory scheduling
performance. In this paper, we investigate the scheduling problem of a fixed
wireless access (FWA) network using only statistical CSI. Thanks to their fixed
positions, user terminals in FWA can easily provide reliable large-scale CSI
lasting tens or even hundreds of TTIs. Inspired by this appealing fact, we
propose an \emph{`once-and-for-all'} scheduling approach, i.e. given multiple
TTIs sharing identical statistical CSI, only a single high-quality scheduling
decision lasting across all TTIs shall be taken rather than repeatedly making
low-quality decisions every TTI. The proposed scheduling design is essentially
a mixed-integer non-smooth non-convex stochastic problem with the objective of
maximizing the weighted sum rate as well as the number of active users. We
firstly replace the indicator functions in the considered problem by
well-chosen sigmoid functions to tackle the non-smoothness. Via leveraging
deterministic equivalent technique, we then convert the original stochastic
problem into an approximated deterministic one, followed by linear relaxation
of the integer constraints. However, the converted problem is still highly
non-convex due to implicit equation constraints introduced by deterministic
equivalent. To address this issue, we employ implicit optimization technique so
that the gradient can be derived explicitly, with which we propose an algorithm
design based on accelerated Frank-Wolfe method. Numerical results verify the
effectiveness of our proposed scheduling scheme over state-of-the-art.

established that the relative amplitude of variability anti-correlates with the
accretion rate.The dependence of the variance on black hole mass has remained
elusive, and contradicting results, including positive, negative, or no
correlation, have been reported. In this work, we show that the key to these
contradictions lies in the timescales of variability studied (e.g., the length
of the light curves available). By isolating the variance on different
timescales as well as mass and accretion rate bins we show that there is indeed
a negative correlation between black hole mass and variance and that this
anti-correlation is stronger for shorter timescale fluctuations. The behavior
can be explained in terms of a universal variability power spectrum for all
quasars, resembling a broken power law where the variance is constant at low
temporal frequencies and then drops continuously for frequencies higher than a
characteristic frequency $f_b$, where $f_b$ correlates with the black hole
mass. Furthermore, to explain all the variance results presented here, not only
the normalization of this power spectrum must anti-correlate with the accretion
rate, but also the shape of the power spectra at short timescales must depend
on this parameter as well.

This study describes how temperature variations on copper surfaces can be

applications at liquid helium temperatures. Furthermore, we explore how the
thermal exchange between thermometers and copper surfaces, and thermometers and

  Jiang","Large Language Models are Strong Zero-Shot Retriever","Work in progress",,,,"cs.CL cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this work, we propose a simple method that applies a large language model
(LLM) to large-scale retrieval in zero-shot scenarios. Our method, Language
language model as Retriever (LameR) is built upon no other neural models but an
LLM, while breaking up brute-force combinations of retrievers with LLMs and
lifting the performance of zero-shot retrieval to be very competitive on
benchmark datasets. Essentially, we propose to augment a query with its
potential answers by prompting LLMs with a composition of the query and the
query's in-domain candidates. The candidates, regardless of correct or wrong,
are obtained by a vanilla retrieval procedure on the target collection. Such
candidates, as a part of prompts, are likely to help LLM generate more precise
answers by pattern imitation or candidate summarization. Even if all the
candidates are wrong, the prompts at least make LLM aware of in-collection
patterns and genres. Moreover, due to the low performance of a self-supervised
retriever, the LLM-based query augmentation becomes less effective as the
retriever bottlenecks the whole pipeline. So, we propose to leverage a
non-parametric lexicon-based method (e.g., BM25) as the retrieval module to
capture query-document overlap in a literal fashion. As such, LameR makes the
retrieval procedure transparent to the LLM, so it circumvents the performance
bottleneck.

  Low-Dimensional Non-Equilibrium Classical Systems?","7 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In one and two dimensions, equilibrium systems with continuous degrees of
freedom do not show the spontaneous symmetry breaking, as the thermal
fluctuation destroys the long-range orders. The simplest way to suppress
fluctuations and realize the long-range orders in low-dimensional systems is
just to consider the ground state at zero temperature. A less trivial example
is an out-of-equilibrium system driven by periodic driving forces, instead of
thermal agitation. If the amplitude of the driving force is sufficiently small,
the periodic force of frequency $\omega_0$ only excites the eigenmode of the
eigenfrequency $\omega_0$. Therefore, the fluctuations would be largely
suppressed even near the critical point, if it exists. Does this mechanism
allows the spontaneous symmetry breaking in low dimensions? We here show that
the answer is positive, at least for the spherical model, which corresponds to
the large $n$ limit of the $O(n)$ model and allows us to analytically calculate
the lower critical dimension $d_l$. For that purpose, we here propose the
driving force inspired by the chiral active matter:
$h(\boldsymbol{x},t)=\sqrt{2D}\cos\theta(\boldsymbol{x},t)$, where
$\dot{\theta}(\boldsymbol{x},t)=\omega_0+\xi(\boldsymbol{x},t)$, and
$\xi(\boldsymbol{x},t)$ denotes the white noise. For the finite strength of the
noise, the model undergoes the second-order ferromagnetic phase transition at
some finite $D=D_c$. In particular, the lower critical dimension is $d_l=2$,
meaning that the ordered phase does not appear for $d\leq d_l=2$. In the
absence of the noise, on the contrary, the model undergoes the ferromagnetic
phase transition for any $d>0$, namely, $d_l=0$. Furthermore, the model for the
conserved order parameter exhibits the hyperuniformity in the absence of the
noise, which has been previously reported for chiral active matter.

research would be understandable if ELSA can be derived from existing tasks and

overall sentiment towards each volitional entity in the text. We sample from

processes. A relative phase difference between the two states is introduced by
changing the polarization state of pump light, thus manipulating the two-photon
state at the output of the Sagnac interferometer. The generated two-photon
state is sent into a fiber polarization splitter, then a pure discrete
frequency-bin entangled two-photon state is obtained by setting the pump light.
The frequency entanglement property is measured by a spatial quantum beating
with a visibility of $96.0 \pm 6.1\%$. The density matrix is further obtained
with a fidelity of $98.0 \pm 3.0\%$ to the ideal state. Our demonstration
provides a promising method for the generation of pure discrete frequency-bin

the features extracted by the model and a protected attribute, without the use
of attribute labels. To do that, FLAC proposes a sampling strategy that
highlights underrepresented samples in the dataset, and casts the problem of
learning fair representations as a probability matching problem that leverages
representations extracted by a bias-capturing classifier. It is theoretically

paper, we calculate the full expression for the number count fluctuation in
terms of a perturbation to the observed luminosity distance. We find the
expression to differ significantly from the one commonly used in redshift
space. Furthermore, we present a comparison of the number count angular power
spectra between luminosity distance and redshift spaces. We see a wide
divergence between the two at large scales, and we note that lensing is the
main contribution to such differences. On such scales and at higher redshifts
the difference between the angular power spectra in luminosity distance and
redshift spaces can be roughly 50$\%$. We also investigate cross-correlating
different redshift bins using different tracers, i.e. one in luminosity
distance space and one in redshift, simulating the cross-correlation angular
power spectrum between background gravitational waves/supernovae and foreground

is that $d$-wave is dominated in cuprates, while both $s$- and $d$-waves are
observed in nickelates. This raises a strong puzzle on its origin, although
these two systems exhibit similar structural and electronic characteristics. To
solve this puzzle, we have investigated an inhomogeneous Hubbard model on a
square lattice using the quantum Monte Carlo method. Surprisingly, we discover
that period of charge stripe $\mathcal{P}$, differing in cuprates and
nickelates, plays an unexpected role in determining the emergence of distinct
pairing symmetries. While the $d$-wave is dominated for $\mathcal{P} \ge 4$
(the cases for cuprates), both $s$- and $d$-wave can appear when $\mathcal{P}<
4$. Taking $\mathcal{P}=3$ as the case for nickelates, we discover that the
interplay between hole-doping concentration $\delta$ and charge-stripe
amplitude $V_0$ can realize a remarkable $d$-$s$ wave transition. It originates
from the $V_0$-modulated charge inhomogeneity between the on-stripe and
inter-stripe region, which is stronger in a smaller $\mathcal{P}$ system,
forming an interesting selection rule for the preferred pairing symmetry.
Interestingly, accompanied by the $d$-$s$ wave transition, there is a novel
magnetic-correlation transition, indicating the inherent intercoupling between
charge stripe, superconducting pairing, and magnetic correlation. In general,
our non-biased simulations provide a new insight into the difference of
superconducting pairing mechanism between nickelates and cuprates, highlighting
the decisive role of charge stripe.

quality software can be produced. Therefore, more research is needed in this
area and this study is trying to fill this gap. This empirical study aims to
examine the importance of pair documentation. Unconventional documentation
refers to the approach when two persons work on the same document's
requirements collaboratively just like pair programming on the requirements
quality and team productivity. Twenty pairs of documentation writers worked
into two groups. one group using pair documentation, i.e., the experimental

both groups were then compared. It is observed that there is a significant
improvement in the quality and productivity of the experimental group using
pair documentation. The findings of this study may assist requirement engineers
in forming efficient teams that can create high-quality SRS documents.

conversion factor depends on the $\pi \pi \to \pi \pi$ scattering amplitude
with the same total isospin (either zero or two) as the $\pi \pi$ decay
channel. Although an infinite tower of $\pi \pi \to \pi \pi$ partial-wave
components affect the conversion factor, the $S$-wave ($\ell=0$) component is
expected to dominate, and only this contribution is included in the well-known
Lellouch-L\""uscher factor, with other $\pi \pi \to \pi \pi$ partial-wave
amplitudes formally set to zero. However, as the precision of lattice
calculations increases, it may become important to assess the systematic
uncertainty arising from this approximation. With this motivation, we compare
the $S$-wave-only results with those truncated at the next contaminating
partial wave: the $G$-wave ($\ell=4$) for zero total momentum in the
finite-volume frame and the $D$-wave ($\ell=2$) otherwise. Using the general
framework for $1 \overset{\mathcal J}{\to} 2$ transitions, we quantify the
effect of higher partial waves for systems with zero and non-zero total
momentum as well as with anti-periodic boundary conditions, presenting both
generic numerical examples and results for realistic $\pi \pi$ amplitudes taken
from chiral perturbation theory and dispersive analysis. We also consider the
accidental degeneracy occurring in the 8$^{\text {th}}$ excited state of the

photosensitizers there is a design tension between the creation of long-lived
excited (triplet), e.g., metal-to-ligand charge transfer (3MLCT) states and the
population of such states. Long-lived triplet states have low spin-orbit
coupling (SOC) and hence their population is low. Thus, a long-lived triplet
state can be populated but inefficiently. If the SOC is increased, the triplet
state population efficiency is improved - coming at the cost of decreasing the
lifetime. A promising strategy to isolate the triplet excited state away from
the metal after intersystem crossing (ISC) involves the combination of the
transition metal complex and an organic donor/acceptor group. Here we elucidate
the excited-state branching processes in a series of Ru(II)-terpyridyl
push-pull triads by means of quantum chemical simulations. Scalar-relativistic
time-dependent density theory simulations reveal that efficient ISC takes place
along 1/3MLCT-gateway states. Subsequently, competitive electron transfer
pathways involving the organic chromophore, i.e., 10-methylphenothiazinyl and
the terpyridyl ligands are available. The kinetics of the underlying electron
transfer processes were investigated within the semi-classical Marcus picture.
The electron transfer kinetics were described along efficient internal reaction

parameter that governs the population transfer away from the metal either
towards the organic chromophore either by means of ligand-to-ligand (3LLCT;

identify the influence of income on activity-based carbon footprint gap of

similar samples with sensitivity awareness in this paper. In the proposed NN
training method for UQ, first, we train a shallow NN for the point prediction.
Then, we compute the absolute differences between prediction and targets and
train another NN for predicting those absolute differences or absolute errors.
Domains with high average absolute errors represent a high uncertainty. In the
next step, we select each sample in the training set one by one and compute
both prediction and error sensitivities. Then we select similar samples with
sensitivity consideration and save indexes of similar samples. The ranges of an
input parameter become narrower when the output is highly sensitive to that
parameter. After that, we construct initial uncertainty bounds (UB) by
considering the distribution of sensitivity aware similar samples. Prediction
intervals (PIs) from initial uncertainty bounds are larger and cover more
samples than required. Therefore, we train bound correction NN. As following
all the steps for finding UB for each sample requires a lot of computation and
memory access, we train a UB computation NN. The UB computation NN takes an
input sample and provides an uncertainty bound. The UB computation NN is the

linear law-based feature space transformation (LLT) on the accuracy of intraday
price movement prediction of cryptocurrencies. To do this, the 1-minute
interval price data of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, and Ripple between 1
January 2019 and 22 October 2022 were collected from the Binance cryptocurrency
exchange. Then, 14-hour nonoverlapping time windows were applied to sample the
price data. The classification was based on the first 12 hours, and the two
classes were determined based on whether the closing price rose or fell after
the next 2 hours. These price data were first transformed with the LLT, then
they were classified by traditional machine learning algorithms with 10-fold
cross-validation. Based on the results, LLT greatly increased the accuracy for
all cryptocurrencies, which emphasizes the potential of the LLT algorithm in
predicting price movements.

ensures that features extracted from contrasting views of the same video were
consistent across spatio-temporal domains. Our proposed approach is efficient
in using transformer-based encoders to alleviate the weakly supervised setting
of group activity recognition. By leveraging the benefits of transformer
models, our approach can model long-term relationships along spatio-temporal
dimensions. Our proposed SoGAR method achieved state-of-the-art results on
three group activity recognition benchmarks, namely JRDB-PAR, NBA, and
Volleyball datasets, surpassing the current numbers in terms of F1-score, MCA,

Availability on FDS (Fraud Detection System) servers that cannot be loaded
balanced using the Round Robin method, resulting in changes to ISO 8583
messages. As a result, a method that can be used as High availability to
maintain the Availability of the FDS Server without changing the message
received is required. High availability will be achieved through the Active
Passive Failover method, which will transfer data flows in the event of an
operational failure on the FDS server. The transfer is based on CPU Load
parameters and ISO 8583 messages, which are checked at each stage. The
waterfall method was used in this research. The waterfall is a straightforward
classic model with a linear system flow, with the output of each stage serving
as the input for the next. The primary goals of this research are to ensure
that data in ISO 8583 format can be streamed without changing messages, to
measure the effectiveness of the Active Passive Failover method in performing
High availability using ISO 8583 message parameters and CPU Load, and to
increase the level of Availability and reliability of the FDS Server. This
research's error rate decreased by 0.83%, and the SLA (Service Level Agreement)
increased from 99.13% to 99.96%.

plays a very important role in functioning of the system. The crosstalk or

such microbial community structures. Evidence reported in biomedical text
serves as a reliable source for predicting such interactions. However, going
through the vast and ever-increasing volume of biomedical literature is an
intimidating and time consuming process. This necessitates development of
automated methods capable of accurately extracting bacterial relations reported
in biomedical literature. In this paper, we introduce a method for automated
extraction of microbial interactions (specifically between bacteria) from
biomedical literature along with ways of using transfer learning to improve its
accuracy. We also describe a pipeline using which relations among specific
bacteria groups can be mined. Additionally, we introduce the first publicly
available dataset which can be used to develop bacterial interaction extraction
methods.

loss incurred by any algorithm. Traditional DP formulations impose a uniform
privacy requirement for all users, which is often inconsistent with real-world
scenarios in which users dictate their privacy preferences individually. This
work considers the problem of mean estimation under heterogeneous DP
constraints, where each user can impose their own distinct privacy level. The
algorithm we propose is shown to be minimax optimal when there are two groups
of users with distinct privacy levels. Our results elicit an interesting
saturation phenomenon that occurs as one group's privacy level is relaxed,
while the other group's privacy level remains constant. Namely, after a certain
point, further relaxing the privacy requirement of the former group does not
improve the performance of the minimax optimal mean estimator. Thus, the
central server can offer a certain degree of privacy without any sacrifice in
performance.

past decade for their applications in target identification,
mechanism-of-action inference, and assay development. These techniques have
generated large datasets of cellular morphologies, which are typically used to
investigate the effects of small molecule perturbagens. In this work, we extend
the impact of such dataset to improving quantitative structure-activity
relationship (QSAR) models by introducing Molecule-Morphology Contrastive
Pretraining (MoCoP), a framework for learning multi-modal representation of
molecular graphs and cellular morphologies. We scale MoCoP to approximately
100K molecules and 600K morphological profiles using data from the JUMP-CP
Consortium and show that MoCoP consistently improves performances of graph
neural networks (GNNs) on molecular property prediction tasks in ChEMBL20
across all dataset sizes. The pretrained GNNs are also evaluated on internal
GSK pharmacokinetic data and show an average improvement of 2.6% and 6.3% in
AUPRC for full and low data regimes, respectively. Our findings suggest that
integrating cellular morphologies with molecular graphs using MoCoP can
significantly improve the performance of QSAR models, ultimately expanding the
deep learning toolbox available for QSAR applications.

in relaxation curves and discuss the relation of the results to the experiments

for the detailed investigation of phase space transport in reactant-product
type systems. For these systems, which exhibit clearly defined start and end
states, it is possible to build a comprehensive picture of the lobe dynamics by
considering backward and forward integration of sets of initial conditions to
index their origin and fate. We illustrate the method and its utility in the
study of a two degrees of freedom caldera potential with four exits,
demonstrating that the OFM not only recapitulates results from classical
manifold theory, but even provides more detailed information about complex lobe
structures. The OFM allows the detection of dynamically significant transitions
caused by the creation of new lobes, and is also able to guide the prediction
of the position of unstable periodic orbits (UPOs). Further, we compute the OFM
on the periodic orbit dividing surface (PODS) associated with the transition
state of a caldera entrance, which allows for a powerful analysis of reactive
trajectories. The intersection of the manifolds corresponding to this UPO with
other manifolds in the phase space results in the appearance of lobes on the
PODS, which are directly classified by the OFM. This allows computations of
branching ratios and the exploration of a fractal cascade of lobes as the
caldera is stretched, which results in fluctuations in the branching ratio and
chaotic selectivity. The OFM is found to be a simple and very useful tool with
a vast range of descriptive and quantitative applications.

  Selection Technique",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Post-processing of the raw bits produced by a true random number generator
(TRNG) is always necessary when the entropy per bit is insufficient for
security applications. In this paper, we derive a tight bound on the output
min-entropy of the algorithmic post-processing module based on linear codes,
known as linear correctors. Our bound is based on the codes' weight
distributions, and we prove that it holds even for the real-world noise sources
that produce independent but not identically distributed bits. Additionally, we
present a method for identifying the optimal linear corrector for a given input
min-entropy rate that maximizes the throughput of the post-processed bits while
simultaneously achieving the needed security level. Our findings show that for
an output min-entropy rate of $0.999$, the extraction efficiency of the linear
correctors with the new bound can be up to $130.56\%$ higher when compared to
the old bound, with an average improvement of $41.2\%$ over the entire input
min-entropy range. On the other hand, the required min-entropy of the raw bits
for the individual correctors can be reduced by up to $61.62\%$.

the game admits a potential function, whose minimum coincides with the social

continuous-depth neural networks, have been widely applied, showing exceptional
efficacy in coping with representative datasets. Recently, an augmented
framework has been developed to overcome some limitations that emerged in the
application of the original framework. In this paper, we propose a new class of
continuous-depth neural networks with delay, named Neural Delay Differential
Equations (NDDEs). To compute the corresponding gradients, we use the adjoint
sensitivity method to obtain the delayed dynamics of the adjoint. Differential
equations with delays are typically seen as dynamical systems of infinite
dimension that possess more fruitful dynamics. Compared to NODEs, NDDEs have a
stronger capacity of nonlinear representations. We use several illustrative
examples to demonstrate this outstanding capacity. Firstly, we successfully
model the delayed dynamics where the trajectories in the lower-dimensional
phase space could be mutually intersected and even chaotic in a model-free or
model-based manner. Traditional NODEs, without any argumentation, are not
directly applicable for such modeling. Secondly, we achieve lower loss and
higher accuracy not only for the data produced synthetically by complex models
but also for the CIFAR10, a well-known image dataset. Our results on the NDDEs
demonstrate that appropriately articulating the elements of dynamical systems
into the network design is truly beneficial in promoting network performance.

In fact, only phenotypes of large size, i.e. those resulting from many
different genotypes, are found in populations of sequences, presumably because
they are easier to discover and maintain. Genotypes that map to these
phenotypes usually form mostly connected genotype networks that percolate the
space of sequences, thus guaranteeing access to a large set of alternative
phenotypes. Within a given environment, where specific phenotypic traits become
relevant for adaptation, the replicative ability of a phenotype and its overall
fitness (in competition experiments with alternative phenotypes) can be
estimated. Two primary questions arise: how do phenotype size, reproductive
capability and topology of the genotype network affect the fitness of a
phenotype? And, assuming that evolution is only able to access large
phenotypes, what is the range of unattainable fitness values? In order to
address these questions, we quantify the adaptive advantage of phenotypes of
varying size and spectral radius in a two-peak landscape. We derive analytical
relationships between the three variables (size, topology, and replicative
ability) which are then tested through analysis of genotype-phenotype maps and
simulations of population dynamics on such maps. Finally, we analytically show
that the fraction of attainable phenotypes decreases with the length of the
genotype, though its absolute number increases. The fact that most phenotypes
are not visible to evolution very likely forbids the attainment of the highest
peak in the landscape. Nevertheless, our results indicate that the relative
fitness loss due to this limited accessibility is largely inconsequential for
adaptation.

expensive with smaller mass ratios, partly because of the longer evolution
time, and partly because the lengthscale disparity dictates smaller time steps.
The program initiated by Dhesi et al. (arXiv:2109.03531) explores a method for
alleviating the scale disparity in simulations with mass ratios in the
intermediate astrophysical range ($10^{-4} \lesssim q \lesssim 10^{-2}$), where
purely perturbative methods may not be adequate. A region (""worldtube"") much
larger than the small black hole is excised from the numerical domain, and
replaced with an analytical model approximating a tidally deformed black hole.
Here we apply this idea to a toy model of a scalar charge in a fixed circular
geodesic orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole, solving for the massless
Klein-Gordon field. This is a first implementation of the worldtube excision
method in full 3+1 dimensions. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of
the method, and discuss the steps towards applying it for evolving orbits and,
ultimately, in the binary black-hole scenario. Our implementation is publicly
accessible in the SpECTRE numerical relativity code.

from the surface. In this process, the excess surface energy available at the

as sufficient kinetic energy to propel the droplets away from the substrate.
Here, we show that the coalescence induced droplet jumping velocity is
significantly curtailed if the superhydrophobic substrate is flexible in
nature. Through detailed experimental measurements and numerical simulations,
we demonstrate that the droplet jumping velocity and jumping height can be
reduced by as much as 40 % and 64%, respectively, by synergistically tuning the
substrate stiffness and substrate frequency. We show that this hitherto
unexplored aspect of droplet coalescence jumping can be gainfully exploited in
water harvesting from dew and fog harvesting. Additionally, through an exemplar

headsets. Unfortunately, mainstream VR devices often use a small number of
trackers and provide low-accuracy animations. Previous studies have shown that
the Sense of Embodiment, and in particular the Sense of Agency, depends on the
extent to which the avatar's movements mimic the user's movements. However, few
works study such effect for tasks requiring a precise interaction with the
environment, i.e., tasks that require accurate manipulation, precise foot
stepping, or correct body poses. In these cases, users are likely to notice
inconsistencies between their self-avatars and their actual pose. In this
paper, we study the impact of the animation fidelity of the user avatar on a
variety of tasks that focus on arm movement, leg movement and body posture. We
compare three different animation techniques: two of them using Inverse
Kinematics to reconstruct the pose from sparse input (6 trackers), and a third
one using a professional motion capture system with 17 inertial sensors. We
evaluate these animation techniques both quantitatively (completion time,
unintentional collisions, pose accuracy) and qualitatively (Sense of
Embodiment). Our results show that the animation quality affects the Sense of
Embodiment. Inertial-based MoCap performs significantly better in mimicking
body poses. Surprisingly, IK-based solutions using fewer sensors outperformed
MoCap in tasks requiring accurate positioning, which we attribute to the higher
latency and the positional drift that causes errors at the end-effectors, which
are more noticeable in contact areas such as the feet.

increases the toxicity of generations. Depending on the persona assigned to

purposes. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel unified

overall takes a generative adversarial architecture, which aims to synthesize
missing modalities from any combination of available ones with a single model.
To this end, we specifically design a Commonality- and Discrepancy-Sensitive
Encoder for the generator to exploit both modality-invariant and specific
information contained in input modalities. The incorporation of both types of
information facilitates the generation of images with consistent anatomy and
realistic details of the desired distribution. Besides, we propose a Dynamic
Feature Unification Module to integrate information from a varying number of
available modalities, which enables the network to be robust to random missing
modalities. The module performs both hard integration and soft integration,
ensuring the effectiveness of feature combination while avoiding information
loss. Verified on two public multi-modal magnetic resonance datasets, the
proposed method is effective in handling various synthesis tasks and shows
superior performance compared to previous methods.

paired and unpaired scores, which we applied to assess the performance of
low-dose CT denoising. We perform an in-depth statistical analysis that not
only studies the correlation between paired and unpaired metrics but also
within each category. This brings out useful guidelines that can help
researchers and practitioners select the right measure for their applications.

$Q_{\rm{HY}}$ at the $X$ $(0,0, \frac{1}{2})$ point by first principles
calculations of the total energy as a function of the phonon coordinate
$Q_{\rm{HY}}$ and electric field $E$. We find that the energy curve as a

indicating the presence of $Q_{\rm{HY}}^2 E^2$ nonlinearity with negative
coupling coefficient. We studied the feasibility of utilizing this nonlinearity
to transiently break the translation symmetry of the material by making the
$Q_{\rm{HY}}$ mode unstable with an intense midinfrared pump pulse. We also
considered the possibility that nonlinear phonon-phonon couplings can excite
the lowest-frequency phonon coordinates $Q_{\rm{LZ}}$ and $Q_{\rm{LX}}$ at $X$
when the $Q_{\rm{HY}}$ mode is externally driven. The nonlinear phonon-phonon
couplings were also obtained from first principles via total-energy

construct the coupled classical equations of motion for the phonon coordinates
in the presence of an external pump term on $Q_{\rm{HY}}$. We numerically
solved them for a range of pump frequencies and amplitudes and found three
regimes where the translation symmetry is broken: i) rectification of the
lowest-frequency coordinates due to large amplitude oscillation of the
$Q_{\rm{HY}}$ coordinate about its equilibrium position, ii) rectification of
only the $Q_{\rm{HY}}$ coordinate without displaced oscillations of the
lowest-frequency coordinates, and iii) rectification of all three coordinates.

achieve state-of-the-art results in many domains such as unconditional image
generation and text-to-speech tasks. They consist of a noising process
destroying the data and a backward stage defined as the time-reversal of the
noising diffusion. Building on their success, diffusion models have recently
been extended to the Riemannian manifold setting. Yet, these Riemannian
diffusion models require geodesics to be defined for all times. While this
setting encompasses many important applications, it does not include manifolds
defined via a set of inequality constraints, which are ubiquitous in many
scientific domains such as robotics and protein design. In this work, we
introduce two methods to bridge this gap. First, we design a noising process
based on the logarithmic barrier metric induced by the inequality constraints.
Second, we introduce a noising process based on the reflected Brownian motion.
As existing diffusion model techniques cannot be applied in this setting, we
derive new tools to define such models in our framework. We empirically
demonstrate the applicability of our methods to a number of synthetic and

prefer to generate low-complexity sequences. Whereas no free lunch theorems
seemingly indicate that individual problems require specialized learners, we
explain how tasks that often require human intervention such as picking an

However, the limited computing resources on edge nodes make the models

Unlike common adversarial attacks for misclassification, the goal of latency
attacks is to increase the inference time, which may stop applications from
responding to the requests within a reasonable time. This kind of attack is
ubiquitous for various applications, and we use object detection to demonstrate
how such kind of attacks work. We also design a framework named Overload to
generate latency attacks at scale. Our method is based on a newly formulated
optimization problem and a novel technique, called spatial attention, to
increase the inference time of object detection. We have conducted experiments
using YOLOv5 models on Nvidia NX. The experimental results show that with
latency attacks, the inference time of a single image can be increased ten
times longer in reference to the normal setting. Moreover, comparing to
existing methods, our attacking method is simpler and more effective.

given the low spectral resolution and relatively low signal-to-noise of the

(M_UV<-20), with blue continua (-2.3<beta<-1.9) and low dust attenuation
(A_V=0.15(+0.3,-0.1)); and at least one of them has high stellar mass for a

candidates in the literature, we find a high rate of redshift confirmation and
low rate of confirmed interlopers (8.3%). Ten out of 34 z>8 candidates with

emission lines in their spectra is consistent with redshifts z>9.6. We find
that z>8 photometric redshifts are generally in agreement (within
uncertainties) with the spectroscopic values. However, the photometric
redshifts tend to be slightly overestimated (average Delta(z)=0.50+/-0.12),
suggesting that current templates do not fully describe the spectra of very

Photons and EM radiation carry angular momentum, which is conserved without

$7.75$ galaxies whose Ly$\alpha$-emission lines were previously detected with
Keck/MOSFIRE observations, using the JWST/NIRSpec observations from the Cosmic
Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey. From NIRSpec data, we confirm
the systemic redshifts of these Ly$\alpha$ emitters, and emission-line ratio
diagnostics indicate these galaxies were highly ionized and metal poor. We
investigate Ly$\alpha$ line properties, including the line flux, velocity
offset, and spatial extension. For the one galaxy where we have both NIRSpec
and MOSFIRE measurements, we find a significant offset in their flux
measurements ($\sim5\times$ greater in MOSFIRE) and a marginal difference in
the velocity shifts. The simplest interpretation is that the Ly$\alpha$
emission is extended and not entirely encompassed by the NIRSpec slit. The
cross-dispersion profiles in NIRSpec reveal that Ly$\alpha$ in one galaxy is
significantly more extended than the non-resonant emission lines. We also
compute the expected sizes of ionized bubbles that can be generated by the
Ly$\alpha$ sources, discussing viable scenarios for the creation of sizable
ionized bubbles ($>$1 physical Mpc). The source with the highest-ionization
condition is possibly capable of ionizing its own bubble, while the other two
do not appear to be capable of ionizing such a large region, requiring
additional sources of ionizing photons. Therefore, the fact that we detect
Ly$\alpha$ from these galaxies suggests diverse scenarios on escape of
Ly$\alpha$ during the epoch of reionization. High spectral resolution spectra
with JWST/NIRSpec will be extremely useful for constraining the physics of
patchy reionization.

we introduce HRS-Bench, a concrete evaluation benchmark for T2I models that is

limited aspects, HRS-Bench measures 13 skills that can be categorized into five
major categories: accuracy, robustness, generalization, fairness, and bias. In

from Dollar Street, a popular benchmark of geographically and economically
diverse images, labeling each image with factors such as color, shape, and
background. These annotations unlock a new granular view into how objects
differ across incomes and regions. We then use these object differences to
pinpoint model vulnerabilities across incomes and regions. We study a range of
modern vision models, finding that performance disparities are most associated
with differences in texture, occlusion, and images with darker lighting. We
illustrate how insights from our factor labels can surface mitigations to
improve models' performance disparities. As an example, we show that mitigating
a model's vulnerability to texture can improve performance on the lower income
level. We release all the factor annotations along with an interactive
dashboard to facilitate research into more equitable vision systems.

disease as diverse aspects of the complexity of tumor growth and cancer
development relate to its genetic machinery and requires addressing the
problems at the level of genome and epigenome. Presumably, the mutational
changes occurring in the regulatory genes responsible for maintaining optimal
cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation gradually lead to cancer
progression and metastasis. Importantly, patients with the same cancer types
respond differently to cancer therapies, indicating the need for a
patient-specific treatment option for cancer cure. Precision oncology is the
field of cancer research that focuses on the genetic profiling of individual
tumors to identify targetable alterations involved in cancer development for
custom-tailored personalized treatment of the disease. It is to rely upon the
genomic study of cancer cells to get a clear picture of the prognosis and
pathways involved in disease progression and to look for the means to
selectively target them to ensure effective treatment of this deadly disease.

designing a treatment regimen for precise treatment of cancer at different

observational and theoretical signatures of mass ejection via accretion disk
winds: we discuss their appearance (including an overview of photoionization

and their life cycles (including efforts to constrain their time-dependent mass
loss rates), and we provide a broad overview of the primary accretion disk wind
driving mechanisms that have been considered in the literature: (1) radiation
pressure, where radiation accelerates a wind by scattering off electrons or
atoms in the disk or its atmosphere; (2) thermal driving, where Compton heating
of the outer accretion disk causes gas thermal velocities to exceed the local
escape speed; and (3) magnetohydrodynamic processes, where gas may be ejected
from the disk via magnetic pressure gradients or magnetocentrifugal effects. We
then turn to spectroscopic constraints on the geometry of accreting systems,
from relativistically blurred emission lines to dipping sources, clumpy,
structured stellar winds, and baryonic jets. We conclude with discussions of

generation is composed of two maximally mixed Majorana neutrinos separated by a
very small mass difference. We explore the physics potential of the JUNO
experiment in constraining this possibility using the measurement of solar
neutrinos. In particular, we investigate cases where one or three sterile
states are present in addition to the active states. We consider two scenarios:
one where JUNO's energy threshold allows for the measurement of $pp$ solar
neutrinos, and the case where JUNO can only measure $^7$Be neutrinos and above.
We find that JUNO will be able to constrain pseudo-Dirac mass splittings of
$\delta m^2 \gtrsim 2.9\times 10^{-13}~{\rm eV^2}$ for the scenario including
$pp$ solar neutrinos, and $\delta m^2 \gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-12}~{\rm eV^2}$
when the measurement only considers $^7$Be monochromatic neutrinos, at the
$3\sigma$ C.L. Thus, including $pp$ neutrinos will be crucial for JUNO to
improve current constraints on the pseudo-Dirac scenario from solar neutrinos.

continue to grow and evolve through ongoing mergers with group-scale systems.
During these merging events, the ram pressure applied by the intracluster
medium acts to strip the gas from the infalling groups, forming large tails of
stripped gas, which eventually become part of the main cluster. In this work,
we present a detailed analysis of our new deep Chandra observations of the NGC
4839 group falling into the nearby Coma cluster, providing a unique opportunity
to explore the way galaxy clusters in the local universe continue to grow. Our
analysis reveals a cold front feature at the leading head of the group,
preceded by a bow shock of hot gas in front with a Mach number of $\sim\! 1.5$.
The power spectrum of surface brightness fluctuations in the tail shows that
the slope gets less steep as the distance from the leading head increases,
changing from $-2.35_{-0.06}^{+0.07}$ at the inner part of the tail to
$-1.37_{-0.07}^{+0.09}$ at the outermost part of the tail. These values are
shallower than the slope of the Kolmogorov 2D power spectrum, indicating that
thermal conduction is being suppressed throughout the tail, enabling long-lived
small-scale turbulence, which would typically be washed out if thermal
conduction was not inhibited. The characteristic amplitude of surface
brightness fluctuations in the tail suggests a mild level of turbulence with a
Mach number in the range of 0.1-0.5, agreeing with that found for the infalling
group in Abell 2142.

structure-property relationships behind the complex photophysical processes of
condensed-phase systems, where structural tuning remains a challenge. This
approach often implicitly treats the dimers as static, with their relevant
state energies and couplings determined by their optimized geometry. Here, we
consider the shortcomings of this approach: dimers are more accurately treated
as dynamic model systems, with the potential for significant conformational
heterogeneity that evolves in time and is intimately connected with
interchromophore coupling strengths. We highlight this concept in the singlet
fission dynamics of a pentacene dimer that is covalently linked through
phenyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole and acetylene bridges. Unrestricted rotations lead
to a vast array of rotational conformers in the ground state. Consequently, we
find that every step in the cascade of singlet fission processes - triplet-pair
formation from S1, triplet-pair recombination, spin evolution within the pair,
and free triplet formation - is qualitatively and quantitatively altered by the
conformer geometry. At room temperature, we find evidence of dynamic
interconversion between conformers on the multiple TT surfaces. Measurements in
frozen solution at 150 K emphasize the significance of static disorder. Our
data reveals the presence of sub-populations that result in
excitation-dependent electron spin polarization. These phenomena demand
consideration of multidimensional potential energy surfaces that define
multiple sub-ensembles in the excited state, a picture we refer to as
heterogeneous singlet fission. More broadly, our results call into question the
general static approach to molecular dimer photophysics, that each step in
consecutive excited-state relaxation pathways can be delineated with a single,

decorrelation cells along the line-of-sight through the plane. Higher surface
brightness regions along the major axis to either side of the nucleus show a
further reduction in polarization and are consistent with a view tangent to a
spiral feature in our disk models. The nucleus also has a similar low
polarization, and this is inconsistent with our model spiral galaxy where the
ordered magnetic field component would be nearly perpendicular to the
line-of-sight through the nucleus on an edge-on view. A model with a barred
spiral morphology with a magnetic field geometry derived from radio synchrotron
observations of face-on barred spirals fits the data much better. There is
clear evidence for a vertical field extending into the halo from one location
in the disk coincident with a polarization null point seen in near-infrared
polarimetry, probably due to a blowout caused by star formation. Although our
observations were capable of detecting a vertical magnetic field geometry
elsewhere in the halo, no clear signature was found. A reduced polarization due

explains our observations, but unusually significant turbulence cannot be ruled

experiments such as E137 and NA64 are affected by the cross sections and
lifetime. We also consider two UV models - the KSVZ model and a lepton-specific
version of the DFSZ model - which have only one of the two couplings at
tree-level. However, the other coupling can be generated at loops, and our
analysis reveals that the simultaneous presence of the two couplings can
significantly modify existing bounds on these models for $10^{-3} < m_a < 10$
GeV, especially for beam dump experiments. Overall, our study highlights the
importance of considering the concurrent effects of the ALP-photon and
ALP-electron couplings in future collider and beam dump analyses.

increasing attention recently, with an annual growth rate of 19.16% and 27.19%

explored the structure, conceptual evolution, and trends in this field by
analyzing data from both Scopus and WoS databases. The research consists of two
study phases: (i) an analysis of chatbot literature and (ii) a comprehensive
review of scientific documents on ChatGPT. In the first phase, a bibliometric
analysis is conducted on all published literature, including articles, book
chapters, conference papers, and reviews on chatbots from both Scopus (5839)
and WoS (2531) databases covering the period from 1998 to 2023. An in-depth
analysis focusing on sources, countries, authors' impact, and keywords has
revealed that ChatGPT is the latest trend in the chatbot field. Consequently,
in the second phase, bibliometric analysis has been carried out on ChatGPT
publications, and 45 published studies have been analyzed thoroughly based on
their methods, novelty, and conclusions. The key areas of interest identified
from the study can be classified into three groups: artificial intelligence and
related technologies, design and evaluation of conversational agents, and
digital technologies and mental health. Overall, the study aims to provide
guidelines for researchers to conduct their research more effectively in the
field of chatbots and specifically highlight significant areas for future
investigation into ChatGPT.

specific applications. However, finding the appropriate rescaling factor most
often involves training a separate network for many different factors and
comparing the performance of each model. The computational burden of these
models means that in practice it is rarely done, and when done only a few
different scaling factors are considered.
  In this work, we present a hypernetwork strategy that can be used to easily
and rapidly generate the Pareto frontier for the trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency as the rescaling factor varies. We show how to train a single
hypernetwork that generates CNN parameters conditioned on a rescaling factor.
This enables a user to quickly choose a rescaling factor that appropriately
balances accuracy and computational efficiency for their particular needs. We
focus on image segmentation tasks, and demonstrate the value of this approach

estimating the volumes of X-ray cavities, the total energy and thus also the
corresponding mechanical jet power required for their inflation can be derived.
Properly estimating their total extent is, however, non-trivial, prone to
biases, nearly impossible for poor-quality data, and so far has been done
manually by scientists. We present a novel and automated machine-learning
pipeline called Cavity Detection Tool (CADET), developed to detect and estimate
the sizes of X-ray cavities from raw Chandra images. The pipeline consists of a
convolutional neural network trained for producing pixel-wise cavity
predictions and a DBSCAN clustering algorithm, which decomposes the predictions
into individual cavities. The convolutional network was trained using mock
observations of early-type galaxies simulated to resemble real noisy
Chandra-like images. The network's performance has been tested on simulated
data obtaining an average cavity volume error of 14 % at an 89 % true-positive
rate. For simulated images without any X-ray cavities inserted, we obtain a 5 %
false-positive rate. When applied to real Chandra images, the pipeline
recovered 91 out of 100 previously known X-ray cavities in nearby early-type
galaxies and all 14 cavities in chosen galaxy clusters. Besides that, the CADET
pipeline discovered 8 new cavity pairs in atmospheres of early-type galaxies
and galaxy clusters (IC4765, NGC533, NGC2300, NGC3091, NGC4073, NGC4125,
NGC4472, NGC5129) and a number of potential cavity candidates.

for probabilistic reasoning that exploits Trigger Graphs (TGs) -- a notion
recently introduced for the non-probabilistic setting. The intuition is that
TGs can effectively store a probabilistic model by avoiding an explicit
materialization of the lineage and by grouping together similar derivations of
the same fact. Firstly, we show how TGs can be adapted to support the possible
world semantics. Then, we describe techniques for efficiently computing a
probabilistic model, and formally establish the correctness of our approach. We
also present an extensive empirical evaluation using a prototype called LTGs.
Our comparison against other leading engines shows that LTGs is not only
faster, even against approximate reasoning techniques, but can also reason over
probabilistic databases that existing engines cannot scale to.

evaluation of the performance function g(x) is very expensive and the function
can be characterized as either highly nonlinear, noisy, or even discrete-state
(e.g., binary). In such cases, only a limited number of calls is feasible, and
gradients of g(x) cannot be used. The input design domain is progressively
segmented by expanding and adaptively refining mesh-like lock-free geometrical
structure. The proposed triangulation-based approach effectively combines the
features of simulation and approximation methods. The algorithm performs two
independent tasks: (i) the estimation of probabilities through an ingenious
combination of deterministic cubature rules and the application of the
divergence theorem and (ii) the sequential extension of the experimental design
with new points. The sequential selection of points from the design domain for
future evaluation of g(x) is carried out through a new learning function, which
maximizes instantaneous information gain in terms of the probability
classification that corresponds to the local region. The extension may be
halted at any time, e.g., when sufficiently accurate estimations are obtained.
Due to the use of the exact geometric representation in the input domain, the
algorithm is most effective for problems of a low dimension, not exceeding
eight. The method can handle random vectors with correlated non-Gaussian
marginals. The estimation accuracy can be improved by employing a smooth
surrogate model. Finally, we define new factors of global sensitivity to
failure based on the entire failure surface weighted by the density of the

two-point velocity differences have similar alignment tendencies with the
two-point velocity difference, implying similar characteristics for the NSD and
KHMH equations. We introduce the two-point sweeping concept and show how it
articulates with the fluctuating interscale energy transfer as the solenoidal
part of the interscale transfer rate does not fluctuate with turbulence
dissipation at any scale above the Taylor length but with the sum of the
time-derivative and the solenoidal interspace transport rate terms. The
pressure fluctuations play an important role in the interscale and interspace
turbulence transfer/transport dynamics as the irrotational part of the
interscale transfer rate is equal to the irrotational part of the interspace
transfer rate and is balanced by two-point fluctuating pressure work. We also
study the homogeneous/inhomogeneous decomposition of interscale transfer. The
statistics of the latter are skewed towards forward cascade events whereas the
statistics of the former are not. We also report statistics conditioned on
intense forward/backward interscale transfer events.

this is by locating datacenters as close to users as possible. These ""cloud

edge datacenters determines who has the fastest access to applications
requiring edge compute - creating a digital divide between those closest and
furthest from a datacenter. In this study we measure latency to the current and
predicted cloud edge datacenters of three major cloud providers around the
world. Our measurements use the RIPE Atlas platform targeting cloud regions,
AWS Local Zones, and network optimization services that minimize the path to
the cloud edge. An analysis of the digital divide shows rising inequality as
the relative difference between users closest and farthest from cloud compute
increases. We also find this inequality unfairly affects lower income census

conditioned on the outcome of an uncertain event, is an increasingly popular
way for robots to act under uncertainty. In this work, we take a game-theoretic
perspective on contingency planning which is tailored to multi-agent scenarios
in which a robot's actions impact the decisions of other agents and vice versa.
The resulting contingency game allows the robot to efficiently coordinate with
other agents by generating strategic motion plans conditioned on multiple
possible intents for other actors in the scene. Contingency games are
parameterized via a scalar variable which represents a future time at which
intent uncertainty will be resolved. Varying this parameter enables a designer
to easily adjust how conservatively the robot behaves in the game.
Interestingly, we also find that existing variants of game-theoretic planning
under uncertainty are readily obtained as special cases of contingency games.
Lastly, we offer an efficient method for solving N-player contingency games
with nonlinear dynamics and non-convex costs and constraints. Through a series
of simulated autonomous driving scenarios, we demonstrate that plans generated
via contingency games provide quantitative performance gains over
game-theoretic motion plans that do not account for future uncertainty

any ambiguity about the mission between teammates before embarking on a
commanded task. The safeguards guaranteed by formal methods can be used to
synthesize correct-by-construction reactive controllers for a robot using
Linear Temporal Logic. If a robot fails to synthesize a controller given an
instruction, it is clear that there exists a logical inconsistency in the
environmental assumptions and/or described interactions. These specifications
however are typically crafted in a language unique to the verification
framework, requiring the human collaborator to be fluent in the software tool
used to construct it. Furthermore, if the controller fails to synthesize, it
may prove difficult to easily repair the specification. Language is a natural
medium to generate these specifications using modern symbol grounding
techniques. Using language empowers non-expert humans to describe tasks to
robot teammates while retaining the benefits of formal verification.
Additionally, dialogue could be used to inform robots about the environment
and/or resolve any ambiguities before mission execution. This paper introduces
an architecture for natural language interaction using a symbolic
representation that informs the construction of a specification in Linear
Temporal Logic. The novel aspect of this approach is that it provides a
mechanism for resolving synthesis failure by hypothesizing corrections to the
specification that are verified through human-robot dialogue. Experiments

both with the Floquet unitary and the $Z_2$ symmetry of the Floquet unitary.
When integrability is weakly broken, both in a manner so as to preserve or

temperature autocorrelation function which, after an initial transient that is
controlled by the strength of the integrability breaking term, approaches a
plateau that does not decay with time. The height of the plateau agrees with a

launching of outflows that can greatly affect the environments surrounding the
compact object. In supermassive black holes, these outflows can even be
powerful enough to dictate the evolution of the entire host galaxy, and yet, to
date, we do not understand how these so-called accretion disk winds are
launched - whether by radiation pressure, magnetic forces, thermal irradiation,
or a combination thereof. An important means of studying disk winds produced
near the central compact object is through X-ray absorption line spectroscopy,
which allows us to probe outflow properties along a single line of sight, but
usually provides little information about the global 3D disk wind structure
that is vital for understanding the launching mechanism and total wind energy
budget. Here, we study Hercules X-1, a unique, nearly edge-on X-ray binary with
a warped accretion disk precessing with a period of about 35 days. This disk
precession results in changing sightlines towards the neutron star, through the
ionized outflow. We perform time-resolved X-ray spectroscopy over the
precession phase and detect a strong decrease in the wind column density by
three orders of magnitude as our sightline progressively samples the wind at
greater heights above the accretion disk. The wind becomes clumpier as it rises
upwards and expands away from the neutron star. Modelling the warped disk
shape, we create a 2D map of wind properties. This unique measurement of the
vertical structure of an accretion disk wind allows direct comparisons to 3D
global simulations to reveal the outflow launching mechanism.

need to be transferred between the device and the edge server during training.
Current techniques reduce the communication introduced by DNN partitioning
using local loss-based methods. We demonstrate that these methods adversely
impact accuracy and ignore the communication costs incurred when transmitting
the activation from the device to the server. This paper proposes ActionFed - a

data sets to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of GraphGANFed. The
molecules generated by GraphGANFed can achieve high novelty (=100) and
diversity (> 0.9). The simulation results also indicate that 1) a lower

the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) in 2009, redefining our understanding
of the heliosphere boundaries and the physical processes occurring at the
interstellar interface. The Ribbon signal is intertwined with that of a
globally distributed flux (GDF) that spans the entire sky. To a certain extent,
Ribbon separation methods enabled examining its evolution independent of the
underlying GDF. Observations over a full solar cycle revealed the Ribbon's
evolving nature, with intensity variations closely tracking those of the solar
wind (SW) structure after a few years delay accounting for the SW-ENA recycling
process. In this work, we examine the Ribbon structure, namely, its ENA fluxes,
angular extent, width, and circularity properties for two years, 2009 and 2019,
representative of the declining phases of two adjacent solar cycles. We find
that, (i) the Ribbon ENA fluxes have recovered in the nose direction and south
of it down to ~ 25{\deg} (for energies below 1.7 keV) and not at mid and high
ecliptic latitudes; (ii) The Ribbon width exhibits significant variability as a
function of azimuthal angle; (iii) Circularity analysis suggests that the 2019
Ribbon exhibits a statistically consistent radius with that in 2009. The
Ribbon's partial recovery is aligned with the consensus of a heliosphere with
its closest point being southward of the nose region. The large variability of
the Ribbon width as a function of Azimuth in 2019 compared to 2009 is likely
indicative of small-scale processes within the Ribbon.

robotics. Despite extensive investigation of classical and learning-based
approaches in the past, robots lack common-sense knowledge about household

learning the priors during the training and typically require significant
expensive resources and time for learning. To address this, we propose a new
framework for visual target navigation that leverages Large Language Models

two paradigms: (i) zero-shot and (ii) feed-forward approaches that use language
to find the relevant frontier from the semantic map as a long-term goal and
explore the environment efficiently. Our analysis demonstrates the notable
zero-shot generalization and transfer capabilities from the use of language.
Experiments on Gibson and Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) demonstrate that the
proposed framework significantly outperforms existing map-based methods in

the common-sense knowledge from the language model leads to more efficient
semantic exploration. Finally, we provide a real robot experiment to verify the

Scalability and transferability are central to the unprecedented computational
efficiency of ML methods. In general, linear-scaling computation can be
achieved through the divide and conquer approach, and the locality of physical
properties is key to partitioning the system into sub-domains that can be
solved separately. Based on the locality assumption, ML model is developed for
the prediction of intensive properties of a finite-size block. Predictions of
large-scale systems can then be obtained by averaging results of the ML model
from randomly sampled blocks of the system. We show that the applicability of
this approach depends on whether the block-size of the ML model is greater than
the characteristic length scale of the system. In particular, in the case of
phase identification across a critical point, the accuracy of the ML prediction
is limited by the diverging correlation length. The two-dimensional Ising model
is used to demonstrate the proposed framework. We obtain an intriguing scaling
relation between the prediction accuracy and the ratio of ML block size over
the spin-spin correlation length. Implications for practical applications are
also discussed.

due to their recyclability. Vitrimers are covalent adaptive networks where some
bonds can break and reform above the vitrimer transition temperature. While
this can lead to desirable behavior such as malleability, this also leads to
undesirable rheological behavior such as low-temperature creep. In this work,
we investigate the molecular mechanisms of the creep of vitrimers using
molecular dynamics simulations. The interplay between dynamic bonding with
mechanical loading is modeled using a topology-based reaction scheme. The creep
behavior is compared against cross-linked epoxies with dynamic reactions to
understand the unique aspects related to dynamic bonding. It is found that the
free volume that arises from tensile loads is reduced in vitrimers through
dynamic bond rearrangement. An important feature that explains the difference
in secondary creep behavior between conventional epoxies and vitrimers is the
orientation of the dynamic bonds during loading. In vitrimers, the dynamic
bonds preferentially align orthogonal to the loading axis, decreasing the axial
stiffness during secondary creep, resulting in larger creep strain compared to
epoxies. Over longer timescales, such increased strain leads to void growth,
resulting in tertiary creep. Thus, chemistry changes or additives that can
prevent the initial realignment of dynamic bonds, and therefore subsequent void
growth, can be an effective strategy to mitigate creep in vitrimers.

used. The results also show that several elusive faults are responsible for

and the widely accepted spatially-flat concordance model of general
relativistic cosmology attributes this phenomenon to a constant dark energy, a
cosmological constant, which is measured to comprise about 70% of the total
energy budget of the current Universe. However, observational discrepancies and
theoretical puzzles have raised questions about this model, suggesting that
alternative cosmological models with non-zero spatial curvature and/or dark
energy dynamics might provide better explanations.
  To explore these possibilities, we have conducted a series of studies using
standardized, lower-redshift observations to constrain six different
cosmological models with varying degrees of flatness and dark energy dynamics.
Through comparing these observations with theoretical predictions, we aim to
deepen our understanding of the evolution of the Universe and shed new light on
its mysteries. Our data provide consistent cosmological constraints across all
six models, with some suggesting the possibility of mild dark energy dynamics
and slight spatial curvature. However, these joint constraints do not rule out
the possibility of dark energy being a cosmological constant and the spatial
hypersurfaces being flat. Overall, our findings contribute to the ongoing
efforts to refine our understanding of the Universe and its properties, and
suggest that multiple cosmological models remain viable.

the poor posterior uncertainty estimates of mean-field variational Bayes
(MFVB). We introduce ``deterministic ADVI'' (DADVI) to address these issues.
DADVI replaces the intractable MFVB objective with a fixed Monte Carlo
approximation, a technique known in the stochastic optimization literature as
the ``sample average approximation'' (SAA). By optimizing an approximate but
deterministic objective, DADVI can use off-the-shelf second-order optimization,
and, unlike standard mean-field ADVI, is amenable to more accurate posterior
linear response (LR) covariance estimates. In contrast to existing worst-case
theory, we show that, on certain classes of common statistical problems, DADVI
and the SAA can perform well with relatively few samples even in very high
dimensions, though we also show that such favorable results cannot extend to
variational approximations that are too expressive relative to mean-field ADVI.
We show on a variety of real-world problems that DADVI reliably finds good
solutions with default settings (unlike ADVI) and, together with LR
covariances, is typically faster and more accurate than standard ADVI.

often restricted by a specific choice of the kernel function. This can be
avoided by optimizing the complexity of the kernel function. For regression
problems with very expensive data, the functional form of the model kernels can
be optimized in the Gaussian process (GP) setting through compositional
function search guided by the Bayesian information criterion. However, the
compositional kernel search is computationally demanding and relies on greedy
strategies, which may yield sub-optimal kernels. An alternative strategy of
increasing complexity of GP kernels treats a GP as a Bayesian neural network
(NN) with a variable number of hidden layers, which yields NNGP models. Here,
we present a direct comparison of GP models with composite kernels and NNGP
models for applications aiming at the construction of global PES for polyatomic
molecules. We show that NNGP models of PES can be trained much more efficiently
and yield better generalization accuracy without relying on any specific form
of the kernel function. We illustrate that NNGP models trained by distributions
of energy points at low energies produce accurate predictions of PES at high
energies. We also illustrate that NNGP models can extrapolate in the input
variable space by building the free energy surface of the Heisenberg model
trained in the paramagnetic phase and validated in the ferromagnetic phase. By
construction, composite kernels yield more accurate models than kernels with a
fixed functional form. Therefore, by illustrating that NNGP models outperform
GP models with composite kernels, our work suggests that NNGP models should be
a preferred choice of kernel models for PES.

eigenfunction expansions under the Boussinesq approximation. In channel domain,
the unsteady flow converges to a steady-state solution either monotonically or
non-monotonically (highly oscillatory), depending on the relation between the
Schmidt number and the non-dimensionalized stratified scalar diffusivity, while
the flow in the half-space inclined plane problem exhibits oscillatory
convergence for all parameters. To validate the Boussinesq approximation, we
propose the quasi-Boussinesq approximation, which includes transverse density
variation in the inertial term. Numerical solutions show that the relative
difference between the Boussinesq and quasi-Boussinesq approximations is
uniformly small. We also study the mixing of a passive tracer induced by the
advection of the unsteady diffusion-driven flow and present the series
representation of the time-dependent effective diffusion coefficient. For small
Schmidt numbers, the effective diffusion coefficient induced by the unsteady
flow solution can oscillate with an amplitude larger than the effective
diffusion coefficient induced by the long-time-limiting steady-state flow.
Interestingly, the unsteady flow solution can reduce the time-dependent
effective diffusion coefficient temporally in some parameter regimes, below
even that produced by pure molecular diffusion in the absence of a flow.
However, at long times, the effective diffusion is significantly enhanced for
large P\'eclet numbers.

curves. We describe the mathematical formalism and demonstrate the new approach
using both simulated light curves and available RM observations. The proposed
method delivers a posterior distribution for the delay that accounts for
observational noise and the non-uniform sampling of the light curves. This
feature allow us to fully quantify its uncertainty and propagate it to
subsequent calculations of dependent physical quantities, e.g., black hole
masses. It delivers out-of-sample predictions, which enables us to subject it

becoming increasingly important in understanding genetic data. Each omics
technique only provides a limited view of the underlying biological process and
integrating heterogeneous omics layers simultaneously would lead to a more
comprehensive and detailed understanding of diseases and phenotypes. However,
one obstacle faced when performing multi-omics data integration is the
existence of unpaired multi-omics data due to instrument sensitivity and cost.
Studies may fail if certain aspects of the subjects are missing or incomplete.
In this paper, we propose a deep learning method for multi-omics integration
with incomplete data by Cross-omics Linked unified embedding with Contrastive
Learning and Self Attention (CLCLSA). Utilizing complete multi-omics data as
supervision, the model employs cross-omics autoencoders to learn the feature
representation across different types of biological data. The multi-omics
contrastive learning, which is used to maximize the mutual information between
different types of omics, is employed before latent feature concatenation. In
addition, the feature-level self-attention and omics-level self-attention are
employed to dynamically identify the most informative features for multi-omics
data integration. Extensive experiments were conducted on four public
multi-omics datasets. The experimental results indicated that the proposed
CLCLSA outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches for multi-omics data
classification using incomplete multi-omics data.

Tuning of the DP in these materials has been suggested via modifications to the

observations for the strongly interacting version of the mixed-field Ising
chain, a nonintegrable lattice model imitating the experimental Rydberg

density-density repulsion $V$, the chain's energy transport in the presence of
a transverse field $g$ is superdiffusive at infinite temperature featured by an
anomalous scaling exponent $\frac{3}{4}$, indicating the existence of a novel
dynamical universality class. Imposing, in addition, a growing longitudinal
field $h$ causes a drastic factorization of the whole Hilbert space into
smaller subsectors, evidenced by the spectral parsing of the eigenstate
entanglement. Being a consequence of this approximate symmetry, a
superdiffusion-to-ballistic transport transition arises at $h\approx g$.
Interestingly, all the above results persist for large but finite interactions

Specifically, a tiny dipolar force can produce a visible energy shift for the

result, the avoided level crossing between two branches is greatly modified in
both location and width in the parameter axis of coupling strength, leading to
a more (less) stable sTG gas for a repulsive (attractive) dipolar force. These

and nuclear physics many-body calculations. Breaking and restoring the
symmetries of the system allow for the inclusion of correlations between
particles. However, the effectiveness of these methods is not always known.
  Purpose: To benchmark the Hartree-Fock method with broken and restored
rotational symmetry in a system of identical interacting fermions on a
one-dimensional quantum ring.
  Method: The ground-state wave function is found using the Hartree-Fock method
both with rotational invariance and with the symmetry broken at the mean-field
level. Rotational symmetry is then restored with an angular momentum projection
method. The ground-state energies are compared to variational Monte Carlo
predictions. This is done for a range of different interactions between the
particles.
  Results: Breaking the rotational symmetry in the Hartree-Fock brings little
improvement to the ground-state energy in weakly repulsive systems or
attractive systems confined on small rings. Larger improvements are found in
strongly repulsive systems and attractive systems on larger rings in which the
particles form a self-bound system. Symmetry restoration brought only small
improvements in most cases but was able to account for most of the remaining
correlation energy (after symmetry breaking) in repulsive systems.
  Conclusions: The effectiveness of incorporating correlations through
rotational symmetry breaking followed by angular momentum projection is
demonstrated for one-dimensional quantum rings, encouraging generalisations to
other symmetries as well as extensions to higher dimensions.

possible to reverse-engineer a user's raw biometric sample, such as a
fingerprint or a face image, from its mathematical (feature-space)
representation. In this paper, we investigate this claim on the specific
example of deep neural network (DNN) embeddings. Inversion of DNN embeddings
has been investigated for explaining deep image representations or synthesizing
normalized images. Existing studies leverage full access to all layers of the
original model, as well as all possible information on the original dataset.
For the biometric authentication use case, we need to investigate this under
adversarial settings where an attacker has access to a feature-space
representation but no direct access to the exact original dataset nor the
original learned model. Instead, we assume varying degree of attacker's
background knowledge about the distribution of the dataset as well as the
original learned model (architecture and training process). In these cases, we
show that the attacker can exploit off-the-shelf DNN models and public
datasets, to mimic the behaviour of the original learned model to varying
degrees of success, based only on the obtained representation and attacker's
prior knowledge. We propose a two-pronged attack that first infers the original
DNN by exploiting the model footprint on the embedding, and then reconstructs
the raw data by using the inferred model. We show the practicality of the
attack on popular DNNs trained for two prominent biometric modalities, face and
fingerprint recognition. The attack can effectively infer the original
recognition model (mean accuracy 83\% for faces, 86\% for fingerprints), and
can craft effective biometric reconstructions that are successfully
authenticated with 1-vs-1 authentication accuracy of up to 92\% for some
models.

specified texts in an image while maintaining its natural and realistic
appearance. Most previous approaches to this task rely on style-transfer models
that crop out text regions and feed them into image transfer models, such as
GANs. However, these methods are limited in their ability to change text style
and are unable to insert texts into images. Recent advances in diffusion models
have shown promise in overcoming these limitations with text-conditional image
editing. However, our empirical analysis reveals that state-of-the-art
diffusion models struggle with rendering correct text and controlling text
style. To address these problems, we propose DIFFSTE to improve pre-trained
diffusion models with a dual encoder design, which includes a character encoder
for better text legibility and an instruction encoder for better style control.
An instruction tuning framework is introduced to train our model to learn the
mapping from the text instruction to the corresponding image with either the
specified style or the style of the surrounding texts in the background. Such a
training method further brings our method the zero-shot generalization ability
to the following three scenarios: generating text with unseen font variation,
e.g., italic and bold, mixing different fonts to construct a new font, and
using more relaxed forms of natural language as the instructions to guide the
generation task. We evaluate our approach on five datasets and demonstrate its
superior performance in terms of text correctness, image naturalness, and style
controllability. Our code is publicly available.

this paper proposes to combine HGKS with a hybrid WENO-AO scheme. The hybrid

Unlike combining the hybrid WENO scheme with traditional Riemann solvers, the

accreting asteroids that are perhaps flung onto the WDs by a planet via
resonance, for instance. A number of theoretical works have looked into the
accretion of asteroids onto WDs and obtained a fair agreement with the observed
accretion rate. However, it is solely a very recent study (referenced in this
work) that has taken asteroid binarity into consideration, examining the
scattering between an asteroid binary and planets and showing that a
dissociation and ejection of the former might result and the effect on WD metal
accretion is likely to be weak. Here, we investigate the close encounter
between an asteroid binary and the central WD and consider how the binary's
dissociation may affect the WD's accretion. We find that depending on the
orbital and physical properties, the components may acquire orbits that are
significantly different (even on the order of unity) from that of the parent
binary. We assumed all the inner main belt asteroids are binaries and we
studied their accretion onto the solar WD under the perturbation of the giant
planets. We find that compared to the case without binaries, the components'
accretion may be postponed (or put forward) by millions of years or more, as
the objects may be taken out of (or driven deeper into) the resonance due to
the sudden orbital change upon dissociation. However, the overall influence of
binary dissociation on the accretion rate is not very significant.

concepts in MRI. Four modules illustrated imaging basics, imaging biology,
imaging physics, and imaging design. Feedback was collected from high school

informative missing outcome data. Methods such as inverse probability weighted
generalized estimating equations have been proposed to account for informative
missingness by weighting the observed individual outcome data in each cluster.
These existing methods have focused on settings where missingness occurs at the
individual level and each cluster has partially or fully observed individual
outcomes. In the presence of missing clusters, e.g., all outcomes from a
cluster are missing due to drop-out of the cluster, these approaches
effectively ignore this cluster-level missingness and can lead to biased
inference if the cluster-level missingness is informative. Informative
missingness at multiple levels can also occur in CRTs with a multi-level
structure where study participants are nested in subclusters such as health
care providers, and the subclusters are nested in clusters such as clinics. In
this paper, we propose new estimators for estimating the marginal treatment
effect in CRTs accounting for missing outcome data at multiple levels based on
weighted generalized estimating equations. We show that the proposed
multi-level multiply robust estimator is consistent and asymptotically normally
distributed provided that one set of the propensity score models is correctly
specified. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method through extensive
simulation and illustrate its use with a CRT evaluating a Malaria

expansion of the Universe, with the Hubble expansion rate determined by sum of
the physical energy densities on all 3-branes where they are localized. In
addition, we explore the cosmology for temperatures above the scales of the
intermediate and IR branes where the Universe is described by a spacetime with
the 3-branes replaced by an event horizon. As the temperature of the Universe
cools down, phase transitions are expected to take place, and the intermediate
and IR branes come out from behind the event horizon. The Goldberger-Wise
mechanism for radion stabilization has a well-known problem of having a
supercooled phase transition, which typically does not get completed in time.
This problem is even more severe when an intermediate brane is introduced,
whose scale is well above TeV, as the corresponding Hubble rate is much larger.
We circumvent the problem by employing an alternative mechanism for radion
stabilization with dark Yang-Mills fields, which prevents a long supercooling
epoch, but still allows the strong first order phase transitions. As a result,
the phase transitions in our multi-brane Universe predict a stochastic
gravitational wave background with a unique multi-peak signature, which is
within the sensitivity reach of future space-based gravitational wave
observers. We also show that there are $N-1$ radions for an $N$ 3-brane set-up,

used format for efficiently representing sparse matrices, the compressed sparse

large-scale SNNs. Sparse matrices for graph adjacency structure provide a
natural fit for describing the connectivity of an SNN, and prior work in the
area of parallel graph partitioning has developed the distributed CSR (dCSR)
format for storing and ingesting large graphs. We contend that organizing
additional network information, such as neuron and synapse state, in alignment
with its adjacency as dCSR provides a straightforward partition-based
distribution of network state. For large-scale simulations, this means each
parallel process is only responsible for its own partition of state, which
becomes especially useful when the size of an SNN exceeds the memory resources
of a single compute node. For potentially long-running simulations, this also
enables network serialization to and from disk (e.g. for checkpoint/restart
fault-tolerant computing) to be performed largely independently between
parallel processes. We also provide a potential implementation, and put it

image prior or ground-truth examples. An overarching challenge in these inverse
problems is that an infinite number of images, including many that are
implausible, are consistent with the observed measurements. Thus, image priors
are required to reduce the space of possible solutions to more desireable
reconstructions. However, in many applications it is difficult or potentially
impossible to obtain example images to construct an image prior. Hence
inaccurate priors are often used, which inevitably result in biased solutions.
Rather than solving an inverse problem using priors that encode the spatial
structure of any one image, we propose to solve a set of inverse problems
jointly by incorporating prior constraints on the collective structure of the
underlying images. The key assumption of our work is that the underlying images
we aim to reconstruct share common, low-dimensional structure. We show that
such a set of inverse problems can be solved simultaneously without the use of
a spatial image prior by instead inferring a shared image generator with a
low-dimensional latent space. The parameters of the generator and latent
embeddings are found by maximizing a proxy for the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).
Once identified, the generator and latent embeddings can be combined to provide
reconstructed images for each inverse problem. The framework we propose can
handle general forward model corruptions, and we show that measurements derived
from only a small number of ground-truth images ($\leqslant 150$) are
sufficient for ""prior-free"" image reconstruction. We demonstrate our approach
on a variety of convex and non-convex inverse problems, ranging from denoising,
phase retrieval, and black hole video reconstruction.

tester that makes $Q$ oracle queries to a given word $w\in \Sigma^n$ and
decides to accept or reject the word $w$. An optimal local tester is a local
tester that has the additional properties of completeness and optimal
soundness. By completeness, we mean that the tester must accept with
probability $1$ if $w\in C$. By optimal soundness, we mean that if the tester
accepts with probability at least $1-\epsilon$ (where $\epsilon$ is small),
then it must be the case that $w$ is $O(\epsilon/Q)$-close to some codeword
$c\in C$ in Hamming distance.
  We show that Generalized Reed-Muller codes admit optimal testers with $Q =
(3q)^{\lceil{ \frac{d+1}{q-1}\rceil}+O(1)}$ queries. Here, for a prime power $q
= p^{k}$, the Generalized Reed-Muller code, RM[n,q,d], consists of the
evaluations of all $n$-variate degree $d$ polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_q$.
Previously, no tester achieving this query complexity was known, and the best
known testers due to Haramaty, Shpilka and Sudan(which is optimal) and due to
Ron-Zewi and Sudan(which was not known to be optimal) both required
$q^{\lceil{\frac{d+1}{q-q/p} \rceil}}$ queries. Our tester achieves query
complexity which is polynomially better than by a power of $p/(p-1)$, which is
nearly the best query complexity possible for generalized Reed-Muller codes.
  The tester we analyze is due to Ron-Zewi and Sudan, and we show that their
basic tester is in fact optimal. Our methods are more general and also allow us
to prove that a wide class of testers, which follow the form of the Ron-Zewi
and Sudan tester, are optimal. This result applies to testers for all
affine-invariant codes (which are not necessarily generalized Reed-Muller

constraint for conventional NOMA with practical constraints, we demonstrate
that it cannot support massive connections. To this end, we propose BIMA where
there are no strict PA constraints, unlike conventional NOMA, thus allowing a
high number of devices. We provide a comprehensive analytical framework for
BIMA for all key performance indicators (KPIs) (i.e., ergodic capacity [EC],
outage probability [OP], and bit error rate [BER]). We evaluate Jain's fairness
index and proportional fairness index in terms of all KPIs. Based on the
extensive computer simulations, we reveal that BIMA outperforms conventional
NOMA significantly, with a performance gain of up to 20-30dB. This performance
gain becomes greater when more devices are supported. BIMA provides a full
diversity order and enables the implementation of an arbitrary number of
devices and modulation orders, which is crucial for IoT networks in dense
areas. BIMA guarantees a fairness system where none of the devices gets a
severe performance and the sum-rate is shared in a fair manner among devices by
guarantying QoS satisfaction. Finally, we provide an intense complexity and
latency analysis and demonstrate that BIMA provides lower latency compared to
conventional NOMA since it allows parallel computing at the receivers and no
iterative operations are required. We show that BIMA reduces latency by up to

Under periodic driving, the emerging qubit states are exponentially protected
against bit and phase flips caused by dissipation, which is the primary source
of decoherence of current qubits. However, we find that dissipation causes

approximation of the Green's function based discrete dislocation dynamics
method (Gu et al. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 83:319-337, 2015). The continuum
dislocation climb formulation has the advantage of accounting for both the
long-range effect of vacancy bulk diffusion and that of the Peach-Koehler climb
force, and the two longrange effects are canceled into a short-range effect
(integral with fast-decaying kernel) and in some special cases, a completely
local effect. This significantly simplifies the calculation in the Green's
function based discrete dislocation dynamics method, in which a linear system
has to be solved over the entire system for the long-range effect of vacancy
diffusion and the long-range Peach-Koehler climb force has to be calculated.
This obtained continuum dislocation climb velocity can be applied in any

(AVs) must be able to predict future behaviors of surrounding object vehicles
(OVs), and assess collision risk accurately for reasonable decision-making.
Aiming at autonomous driving in highway scenarios, a predictive collision risk
assessment method based on trajectory prediction of OVs is proposed in this
paper. Firstly, the vehicle trajectory prediction is formulated as a sequence
generation task with long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder framework.
Convolutional social pooling (CSP) and graph attention network (GAN) are
adopted for extracting local spatial vehicle interactions and distant spatial
vehicle interactions, respectively. Then, two basic risk metrics,
time-to-collision (TTC) and minimal distance margin (MDM), are calculated
between the predicted trajectory of OV and the candidate trajectory of AV.
Consequently, a time-continuous risk function is constructed with temporal and
spatial risk metrics. Finally, the vehicle trajectory prediction model
CSP-GAN-LSTM is evaluated on two public highway datasets. The quantitative
results indicate that the proposed CSP-GAN-LSTM model outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of position prediction accuracy.
Besides, simulation results in typical highway scenarios further validate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed predictive collision risk
assessment method.

spurious correlations can be eliminated. DESMIL applies an attentive module to

with high computing efficiency, due to a key component that they utilize spikes
as information units, close to the biological neural systems. Although spiking
based models are energy efficient by taking advantage of discrete spike
signals, their performance is limited by current network structures and their
training methods. As discrete signals, typical SNNs cannot apply the gradient
descent rules directly into parameters adjustment as artificial neural networks
(ANNs). Aiming at this limitation, here we propose a novel method of
constructing deep SNN models with knowledge distillation (KD) that uses ANN as
teacher model and SNN as student model. Through ANN-SNN joint training
algorithm, the student SNN model can learn rich feature information from the
teacher ANN model through the KD method, yet it avoids training SNN from
scratch when communicating with non-differentiable spikes. Our method can not
only build a more efficient deep spiking structure feasibly and reasonably, but
use few time steps to train whole model compared to direct training or ANN to
SNN methods. More importantly, it has a superb ability of noise immunity for
various types of artificial noises and natural signals. The proposed novel
method provides efficient ways to improve the performance of SNN through
constructing deeper structures in a high-throughput fashion, with potential
usage for light and efficient brain-inspired computing of practical scenarios.

to a stable fixed point of an associated statistical state dynamics (SSD)
closed at second order, referred to as S3T, this is not the case for
wall-turbulence. In wall-turbulence the trajectory of the statistical state
evolves on a chaotic attractor in its statistical state phase space and as a
result the time-mean statistical state is neither a fixed point of the SSD nor
is it stable. In this report we demonstrate that the time-mean statistical
state in S3T SSD of plane Couette flow (pCf) turbulence is S3T unstable.
Nevertheless, sufficiently small perturbations from the time-mean state, have
been verified to relax back to the unique time-mean following an effective
linear dynamics. In this report we obtain using a linear inverse model (LIM)
the effective linear operator governing relaxation of spanwise uniform
streamwise perturbations to the time-mean flow for the case of a DNS of plane
Poiseuille flow (pPf) turbulence and in the case of an S3T SSD simulation of

operator, and verify its stability. These results show that in wall turbulence,
even though stable fixed point equilibria corresponding to the time-mean
statistical state are not available to allow application of perturbation
analysis methods to analyze the linear dynamics underlying its stability in the

powerful deep models without compromising data privacy and security. The
statistical heterogeneity (e.g., non-IID data and domain shifts) is a primary
obstacle in FL, impairing the generalization performance of the global model.
Weakly supervised segmentation, which uses sparsely-grained (i.e., point-,
bounding box-, scribble-, block-wise) supervision, is increasingly being paid
attention to due to its great potential of reducing annotation costs. However,
there may exist label heterogeneity, i.e., different annotation forms across
sites. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized FL framework for medical
image segmentation, named FedICRA, which uniformly leverages heterogeneous weak
supervision via adaptIve Contrastive Representation and Aggregation.
Concretely, to facilitate personalized modeling and to avoid confusion, a
channel selection based site contrastive representation module is employed to
adaptively cluster intra-site embeddings and separate inter-site ones. To
effectively integrate the common knowledge from the global model with the
unique knowledge from each local model, an adaptive aggregation module is
applied for updating and initializing local models at the element level.
Additionally, a weakly supervised objective function that leverages a
multiscale tree energy loss and a gated CRF loss is employed to generate more
precise pseudo-labels and further boost the segmentation performance. Through
extensive experiments on two distinct medical image segmentation tasks of
different modalities, the proposed FedICRA demonstrates overwhelming
performance over other state-of-the-art personalized FL methods. Its
performance even approaches that of fully supervised training on centralized

limited sample sizes. This makes the target data based statistical estimation
very difficult. Then how to borrow information from another large sized source

This leads to the useful idea of transfer learning. Various estimation methods
in this regard have been developed recently. In this work, we study transfer
learning from a different perspective. Specifically, we consider here the
problem of testing for transfer learning sufficiency. By transfer learning
sufficiency (denoted as the null hypothesis), we mean that, with the help of
the source data, the useful information contained in the feature vectors of the
target data can be sufficiently extracted for predicting the interested target
response. Therefore, the rejection of the null hypothesis implies that
information useful for prediction remains in the feature vectors of the target
data and thus calls for further exploration. To this end, we develop a novel
testing procedure and a centralized and standardized test statistic, whose
asymptotic null distribution is analytically derived. Simulation studies are
presented to demonstrate the finite sample performance of the proposed method.

multi-modality sensing module composed of infrared and visible cameras needs to
be registered so as to have more accurate scene perception. In practice, manual
calibration-based registration is the most widely used process, and it is
regularly calibrated to maintain accuracy, which is time-consuming and
labor-intensive. To cope with these problems, we propose a scene-adaptive
infrared and visible image registration. Specifically, in regard of the
discrepancy between multi-modality images, an invertible translation process is
developed to establish a modality-invariant domain, which comprehensively
embraces the feature intensity and distribution of both infrared and visible
modalities. We employ homography to simulate the deformation between different
planes and develop a hierarchical framework to rectify the deformation inferred
from the proposed latent representation in a coarse-to-fine manner. For that,
the advanced perception ability coupled with the residual estimation conducive
to the regression of sparse offsets, and the alternate correlation search
facilitates a more accurate correspondence matching. Moreover, we propose the
first ground truth available misaligned infrared and visible image dataset,

save bandwidth. During viewport switches, clients and servers will instantly
exchange coordination info and contents for the given viewports. However, those
viewport switches pose a serious challenge for video encoding because the
temporal dependency between contents within changing viewports is
unpredictable. In existing practices, it is commonly noted that GOP (Group of
Pictures) size in a bitstream intrinsically prohibits the reduction of the
viewport switch latency, such as Motion-to-photon (MTP) latency, or
motion-to-high-quality (MTHQ) latency. In this paper, we presented a Scalable
Video Coding (SVC) based bitstream schema, which can structurally remove the
impacts of GOP in viewport-dependent streaming and provide instant viewport
switches within one-frame time (the best possible). In addition, combined with
tiling, this new coding schema allows an efficient packing of the non-adjacent
regions within a viewport of 360-degree video. Our experiments also show that
the overall encoding with this SVC-based approach is faster than with
multi-stream approaches. Compared with current 360-degree video streaming
solutions based on MPEG-I OMAF, our approach is superior in terms of viewport
switch latency, simplicity of viewport packing, and encoding performance.

properties and performances through shape reconfigurations. They normally
achieve active properties through internal structural deformations, which often
lead to changes in overall dimensions. This also demands the corresponding
alterations of the conforming substrate, which could be a significant
limitation for their practical applications. To date, achieving area-preserving
active metasurfaces with distinct shape reconfigurations remains a prominent
challenge. In this paper, we present magneto-mechanical bilayer metasurfaces
that demonstrate area density tunability with area-preserving capability. The
bilayer metasurfaces primarily consist of two arrays of magnetic soft materials
with distinct magnetization distributions. Under an external magnetic field,
each layer behaves differently, which allows the metasurface to reconfigure its
shape into multiple modes and thus significantly tune its area density without
changing its overall dimensions. The area-preserving multimodal shape
reconfigurations are further exploited as active acoustic wave regulators to
tune bandgaps and wave propagations. The bilayer approach thus provides a new
concept to design area-preserving active metasurfaces for broader practical
applications.

concise vector graphics with sharp boundaries rather than pixel-wise raster
images. This need contrasts with the majority of existing methods, which
typically generate over-smoothed footprint polygons. Editing these
automatically produced polygons can be inefficient, if not more time-consuming
than manual digitization. This paper introduces a semi-automatic approach for
building footprint extraction through semantically-sensitive superpixels and
neural graph networks. Drawing inspiration from object-based classification
techniques, we first learn to generate superpixels that are not only
boundary-preserving but also semantically-sensitive. The superpixels respond
exclusively to building boundaries rather than other natural objects, while
simultaneously producing semantic segmentation of the buildings. These
intermediate superpixel representations can be naturally considered as nodes
within a graph. Consequently, graph neural networks are employed to model the
global interactions among all superpixels and enhance the representativeness of
node features for building segmentation. Classical approaches are utilized to
extract and regularize boundaries for the vectorized building footprints.
Utilizing minimal clicks and straightforward strokes, we efficiently accomplish
accurate segmentation outcomes, eliminating the necessity for editing polygon
vertices. Our proposed approach demonstrates superior precision and efficacy,
as validated by experimental assessments on various public benchmark datasets.
We observe a 10\% enhancement in the metric for superpixel clustering and an
8\% increment in vector graphics evaluation, when compared with established

  Problem with Trip Shifting",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The solution of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Scheduling Problem (MDVSP) can often
be improved substantially by incorporating Trip Shifting (TS) as a model
feature. By allowing departure times to deviate a few minutes from the original
timetable, new combinations of trips may be carried out by the same vehicle,
thus leading to more efficient scheduling. However, explicit modeling of each
potential trip shift quickly causes the problem to get prohibitively large for
current solvers, such that researchers and practitioners were obligated to
resort to heuristic methods to solve large instances. In this paper, we develop
a Dynamic Discretization Discovery algorithm that guarantees an optimal
continuous-time solution to the MDVSP-TS without explicit consideration of all
trip shifts. It does so by iteratively solving and refining the problem on a
partially time-expanded network until the solution can be converted to a
feasible vehicle schedule on the fully time-expanded network. Computational
results demonstrate that this algorithm outperforms the explicit modeling
approach by a wide margin and is able to solve the MDVSP-TS even when many
departure time deviations are considered.

end of the period of thermal inflation. We discuss the differences of these
strings compared to the strings which form in the Abelian Higgs model.
Specifically, we find that the upper bound on the symmetry breaking scale is

a potential two-dimensional (2D) magnetic material due to its high Curie

band gap of TaNF can be achieved by biaxial strain, which can transform TaNF
monolayer from semiconductor to semi-metal. The magnitude of valley splitting
at the CBM can be effectively tuned by biaxial strain due to the changes of
orbital composition at the valleys. The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) can be
manipulated by changing the energy and occupation (unoccupation) states of d
orbital compositions through biaxial strain. In addition, Curie temperature
reaches 373 K under only -3% biaxial strain, indicating that Janus TaNF

quantum computers and quantum neural networks whose essential tasks are to
realize certain unitary operations. The circuit model usually implements a

gates from a universal set. Although this certainly facilitates the
experimentalists as they only need to prepare several different kinds of
universal gates, the number of gates required to implement an arbitrary desired
unitary operation is usually large. Hence the efficiency in terms of the
circuit depth or running time is not guaranteed. Here we propose an alternative
approach; we use a simple discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) on a cycle graph to
model an arbitrary unitary operation without the need to decompose it into a
sequence of gates of smaller sizes. Our model is essentially a quantum neural
network based on DTQW. Firstly, it is universal as we show that any unitary
operation can be realized via an appropriate choice of coin operators.
Secondly, our DTQW-based neural network can be updated efficiently via a
learning algorithm, i.e., a modified stochastic gradient descent algorithm
adapted to our network. By training this network, one can promisingly find
approximations to arbitrary desired unitary operations. With an additional
measurement on the output, the DTQW-based neural network can also implement
general measurements described by positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs). We
show its capacity in implementing arbitrary 2-outcome POVM measurements via
numeric simulation. We further demonstrate that the network can be simplified
and can overcome device noises during the training so that it becomes more
friendly for laboratory implementations. Our work shows the capability of the
DTQW-based neural network in quantum computation and its potential in

the most promising approaches to achieve domain generalization (DG) is
generating unseen data, e.g., mixup, to cover the unknown target data. However,
existing works overlook the challenges induced by the simultaneous appearance
of changes in both the semantic and distribution space. Accordingly, such a
challenge makes source distributions hard to fit for DNNs. To mitigate the
hard-fitting issue, we propose to perform a semantic-aware mixup (SAM) for
domain generalization, where whether to perform mixup depends on the semantic
and domain information. The feasibility of SAM shares the same spirits with the
Fourier-based mixup. Namely, the Fourier phase spectrum is expected to contain
semantics information (relating to labels), while the Fourier amplitude retains
other information (relating to style information). Built upon the insight, SAM
applies different mixup strategies to the Fourier phase spectrum and amplitude
information. For instance, SAM merely performs mixup on the amplitude spectrum
when both the semantic and domain information changes. Consequently, the
overwhelmingly large change can be avoided. We validate the effectiveness of
SAM using image classification tasks on several DG benchmarks.

the values of hyper-parameters controlling the different signals (related to
bottom-up inputs, top-down prediction and error correction). Similarly, it is
possible to determine in which direction, and at what speed neural activity
propagates in the system. Different neural assemblies (reflecting distinct
eigenvectors of the connectivity matrices) can simultaneously and independently
display different properties in terms of stability, propagation speed or

manufacturing (AM) to avoid build failures. In this paper, we present a
multisensor fusion-based digital twin for in-situ quality monitoring and defect
correction in a robotic laser direct energy deposition process. Multisensor
fusion sources consist of an acoustic sensor, an infrared thermal camera, a
coaxial vision camera, and a laser line scanner. The key novelty and
contribution of this work are to develop a spatiotemporal data fusion method
that synchronizes and registers the multisensor features within the part's 3D
volume. The fused dataset can be used to predict location-specific quality
using machine learning. On-the-fly identification of regions requiring material
addition or removal is feasible. Robot toolpath and auto-tuned process
parameters are generated for defecting correction. In contrast to traditional
single-sensor-based monitoring, multisensor fusion allows for a more in-depth
understanding of underlying process physics, such as pore formation and
laser-material interactions. The proposed methods pave the way for
self-adaptation AM with higher efficiency, less waste, and cleaner production.

(ICs) to external foundries due to the exorbitant cost and complexity of the
process. This involvement of untrustworthy, external entities opens the door to
major security threats, such as reverse engineering (RE). RE can reveal the
physical structure and functionality of intellectual property (IP) and ICs,
leading to IP theft, counterfeiting, and other misuses. The concept of the
threshold voltage-defined (TVD) logic family is a potential mechanism to
obfuscate and protect the design and prevent RE. However, it addresses
post-fabrication RE issues, and it has been shown that dopant profiling
techniques can be used to determine the threshold voltage of the transistor and
break the obfuscation. In this work, we propose a novel TVD modulation with
ion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFETs) to protect the IC from RE and
IP piracy. Compared to the conventional TVD logic family, ISFET-TVD allows
post-manufacture programming. The ISFET-TVD logic gate can be reconfigured
after fabrication, maintaining an exact schematic architecture with an
identical layout for all types of logic gates, and thus overcoming the
shortcomings of the classic TVD. The threshold voltage of the ISFETs can be
adjusted after fabrication by changing the ion concentration of the material in
contact with the ion-sensitive gate of the transistor, depending on the Boolean
functionality. The ISFET is CMOS compatible, and therefore implemented on 45 nm
CMOS technology for demonstration.

of calling methods and slows down the measurement process. Therefore, an
important challenge for performance measurement is the reduction of the

  To address this challenge, the overhead should be minimized. Based on an

optimization options: (1) Source instrumentation instead of AspectJ
instrumentation, (2) reduction of measurement data, (3) change of the queue and
(4) aggregation of measurement data. We evaluate the effect of these

However, the inferring process is highly non-linear and suffers from image-mesh
misalignment, resulting in inaccurate reconstruction. In contrast, 3D keypoint
estimation methods utilize the volumetric representation to achieve pixel-level
accuracy but may predict unrealistic body structures. To address these issues,
this paper presents a novel hybrid inverse kinematics solution, HybrIK, that
integrates the merits of 3D keypoint estimation and body mesh recovery in a
unified framework. HybrIK directly transforms accurate 3D joints to body-part
rotations via twist-and-swing decomposition. The swing rotations are
analytically solved with 3D joints, while the twist rotations are derived from
visual cues through neural networks. To capture comprehensive whole-body
details, we further develop a holistic framework, HybrIK-X, which enhances
HybrIK with articulated hands and an expressive face. HybrIK-X is fast and
accurate by solving the whole-body pose with a one-stage model. Experiments
demonstrate that HybrIK and HybrIK-X preserve both the accuracy of 3D joints
and the realistic structure of the parametric human model, leading to
pixel-aligned whole-body mesh recovery. The proposed method significantly

We have
observed that almost all coded computing systems studied so far consider a
setup of one master and some workers. However, recently emerging technologies
such as blockchain, internet of things, and federated learning introduce new
requirements for coded computing systems. In these systems, data is generated
in a distributed manner, so central encoding/decoding by a master is not
feasible and scalable. This paper presents a fully distributed coded computing
system that consists of $k\in\mathbb{N}$ data owners and $N\in\mathbb{N}$
workers, where data owners employ workers to do some computations on their
data, as specified by a target function $f$ of degree $d\in\mathbb{N}$. As
there is no central encoder, workers perform encoding themselves, prior to
computation phase. The challenge in this system is the presence of adversarial
data owners that do not know the data of honest data owners but cause
discrepancies by sending different data to different workers, which is
detrimental to local encodings in workers. There are at most
$\beta\in\mathbb{N}$ adversarial data owners, and each sends at most
$v\in\mathbb{N}$ different versions of data. Since the adversaries and their
possibly colluded behavior are not known to workers and honest data owners,
workers compute tags of their received data, in addition to their main
computational task, and send them to data owners to help them in decoding. We
introduce a tag function that allows data owners to partition workers into sets
that previously had received the same data from all data owners. Then, we
characterize the fundamental limit of the system, $t^*$, which is the minimum
number of workers whose work can be used to correctly calculate the desired
function of data of honest data owners. We show that $t^*=v^{\beta}d(K-1)+1$,

XMM-Newton to study the empirical Neupert effect, which correlates the gradual
and impulsive phase flaring emissions. We find that 65% (30 of 46) flares do
not follow the Neupert effect, which is three times more excursions than seen
in solar flares, and propose a four part Neupert effect classification
(Neupert, Quasi-Neupert, Non-Neupert I & II) to explain the multi-wavelength
responses. While the SXR emission generally lags behind the NUV as expected
from the chromospheric evaporation flare models, the Neupert effect is more
prevalent in larger, more impulsive flares. Preliminary flaring rate analysis
with X-ray and U-band data suggests that previously estimated energy ratios
hold for a collection of flares observed over the same time period, but not
necessarily for an individual, multi-wavelength flare. These results imply that
one model cannot explain all stellar flares and care should be taken when
extrapolating between wavelength regimes. Future work will expand wavelength
coverage using radio data to constrain the nonthermal empirical and theoretical
Neupert effects to better refine models and bridge the gap between stellar and

observers is that they all assume persistent excitation (PE) of the systems. As
a result, they may lead to poor estimation precision when PE is not ensured,
for instance, when the disturbance gain of the system is close to the

concurrent learning (CL) with time-variant history stacks, which ensures high
estimation precision even in PE-free cases. The disturbance observer is
designed in both continuous and discrete time. The estimation errors of the
proposed method are proved to converge to a bounded set using the Lyapunov
method. A history-sample-selection procedure is proposed to reduce the
estimation error caused by the accumulation of old history samples. A
simulation study on epidemic control shows that the proposed method produces
higher estimation precision than the conventional disturbance observer when PE
is not satisfied. This justifies the correctness of the proposed CL-based

long-range relationships and improving the performance of point cloud tasks.
However, point cloud objects are typically characterized by complex,
disordered, and non-Euclidean spatial structures with multiple scales, and
their behavior is often dynamic and unpredictable. The current self-attention
modules mostly rely on dot product multiplication and dimension alignment among
query-key-value features, which cannot adequately capture the multi-scale
non-Euclidean structures of point cloud objects. To address these problems,
this paper proposes a self-attention plug-in module with its variants,
Multi-scale Geometry-aware Transformer (MGT). MGT processes point cloud data
with multi-scale local and global geometric information in the following three
aspects. At first, the MGT divides point cloud data into patches with multiple
scales. Secondly, a local feature extractor based on sphere mapping is proposed
to explore the geometry inner each patch and generate a fixed-length
representation for each patch. Thirdly, the fixed-length representations are
fed into a novel geodesic-based self-attention to capture the global
non-Euclidean geometry between patches. Finally, all the modules are integrated
into the framework of MGT with an end-to-end training scheme. Experimental
results demonstrate that the MGT vastly increases the capability of capturing
multi-scale geometry using the self-attention mechanism and achieves strong
competitive performance on mainstream point cloud benchmarks.

In each of these ensembles, we first compute the topological charges associated

its local and global topology by computing the winding numbers at the defects.
We observe that while the topologies of the black hole in canonical and mixed

topological charge is either equal to $0$ or $1$. In canonical and mixed

permits an analysis of how certain inference rule types interact in a general

transformed into a lattice of polynomially equivalent abstract calculi. We
determine the complexity of computing this lattice and compute the relative

similar way. Therefore, we studied the interaction of emotion and attention
during face processing in oscillatory gamma-band activity (GBA) in the amygdala
and on the scalp. Amygdala signals were recorded via intracranial EEG (iEEG) in
10 patients with epilepsy. Scalp recordings were collected from 19 healthy

presented, and either negative, neutral, or positive expressions were denoted
as targets. Both groups detected happy faces fastest and most accurately.
During attention to negative faces, low GBA (< 90 Hz) increased specifically
for angry faces both in the amygdala and over posterior scalp regions, albeit
earlier on the scalp (60 ms) than in the amygdala (130 ms). From 220 ms,
amygdala high GBA (117.5-145 Hz) was additionally persistently increased for
both angry and neutral compared to happy faces. When neutral faces served as
targets, amygdala high GBA (105-122.5 Hz) was higher for emotional than neutral
faces from 160-320 ms. Attention to positive faces did not result in a
differentiation between facial expressions. Present data reveal that
attention-independent emotion detection in amygdala high GBA may only occur
during a neutral focus of attention. Top-down threat vigilance coordinates
widespread GBA, biasing stimulus processing in favor of negative faces. These
results are in line with a multi-pathway model of emotion processing and help
specify the role of GBA in this process by revealing how attentional focus can

human motion is typically optimal for human embodiment but not for robots
because of the differences between human biomechanics and robot dynamics. The
Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) framework is a viable solution for this
limitation of LfD, but it requires tuning the second-order dynamics in the
formulation. Our contribution is introducing a systematic method to extract the
dynamic features from human demonstration to auto-tune the parameters in the
DMP framework. In addition to its use with LfD, another utility of the proposed
method is that it can readily be used in conjunction with Reinforcement
Learning (RL) for robot training. In this way, the extracted features
facilitate the transfer of human skills by allowing the robot to explore the
possible trajectories more efficiently and increasing robot compliance
significantly. We introduced a methodology to extract the dynamic features from
multiple trajectories based on the optimization of human-likeness and
similarity in the parametric space. Our method was implemented into an actual
human-robot setup to extract human dynamic features and used to regenerate the
robot trajectories following both LfD and RL with DMP. It resulted in a stable
performance of the robot, maintaining a high degree of human-likeness based on
accumulated distance error as good as the best heuristic tuning.

Suitable measures of noncommutativity or 'quantumness' include quantum Fisher

from pre-collapse core convection fluctuations that are amplified by
post-collapse instabilities. The fixed angular momentum component results from
pre-collapse core rotation. For slowly rotating pre-collapse cores the
stochastic angular momentum fluctuations form intermittent accretion disks (or
belts) around the NS with varying angular momentum axes in all directions. The
intermittent accretion disk/belt launches jets in all directions that expel the
core material in all directions early on, hence leaving a NS remnant. Rapidly
rotating pre-collapse cores form an accretion disk with angular momentum axis
that is about the same as the pre-collapse core rotation. The NS launches jets
along this axis and hence the jets avoid the equatorial plane region.
In-flowing core material continues to feed the central object from the
equatorial plane increasing the NS mass to form a BH. The narrow transition
from slow to rapid pre-collapse core rotation, i.e., from an efficient to
inefficient jet feedback mechanism, accounts for the sparsely populated mass
gap.

detector placement in a networked control system under cyber-attacks. The
networked control system is composed of interconnected agents where each agent
is regulated by its local controller over unprotected communication, which
leaves the system vulnerable to malicious cyber-attacks. To guarantee a given
local performance, the defender optimally selects a single agent on which to
place a detector at its local controller with the purpose of detecting
cyber-attacks. On the other hand, an adversary optimally chooses a single agent
on which to conduct a cyber-attack on its input with the aim of maximally
worsening the local performance while remaining stealthy to the defender.
First, we present a necessary and sufficient condition to ensure that the
maximal attack impact on the local performance is bounded, which restricts the
possible actions of the defender to a subset of available agents. Then, by
considering the maximal attack impact on the local performance as a game
payoff, we cast the problem of finding optimal actions of the defender and the
adversary as a zero-sum game. Finally, with the possible action sets of the
defender and the adversary, an algorithm is devoted to determining the Nash
equilibria of the zero-sum game that yield the optimal detector placement. The
proposed method is illustrated on an IEEE benchmark for power systems.

given metric can be characterized by what we call infinitesimal growth
exponents. Then the maximization procedure of such values provides an upper
bound (usually, very rough) for the largest uniform Lyapunov exponent. However,
for quasi-compact cocycles, we prove that one can always adapt the metric (not
necessarily coercive) in such a way that the maximization procedure will
produce values arbitrarily close to the largest uniform Lyapunov exponent of
the cocycle. In the context of compound cocycles acting on exterior products of
Hilbert spaces, this gives a variational description of uniform Lyapunov
exponents and allows to give a comprehensive look at the Liouville trace
formula, which describes evolution of infinitesimal volumes, and the
corresponding symmetrization procedure that are widely used to obtain effective
dimension estimates for global attractors in finite and infinite-dimensional
dynamical systems. Our abstract result explains known exact computations of the
Lyapunov dimension over global attractors with the aid of adapted metrics and
motivates further investigations of the problem.
  We use adapted metrics and the trace formula to obtain (to the best of our

such estimates for chaotic attractors arising in the Mackey-Glass equations and
periodically forced Suarez-Schopf delayed oscillator. As the delay value tends

  Methods: We have created a graph-based algorithm to optimize the trajectory

is NP-hard, we have employed an approximation algorithm that can solve this
kind of Traveling Salesman Problem efficiently.
  Results: When compared to a conventional serpentine pattern, the optimized

indulgent gathering (SUIG). In this problem, a group of mobile robots must
eventually gather at a single location, which is not known in advance. If no
robots crash, they must all meet at the same location. However, if one or more
robots crash at a single location, all non-crashed robots must eventually
gather at that location. The SUIG problem was first introduced for robots
operating in a two-dimensional continuous Euclidean space, with most solutions
relying on the ability of robots to move a prescribed (real) distance at each
time instant. In this paper, we investigate the SUIG problem for robots
operating in a discrete universe (i.e., a graph) where they can only move one
unit of distance (i.e., to an adjacent node) at each time instant.
Specifically, we focus on line-shaped networks and characterize the solvability
of the SUIG problem for oblivious robots without multiplicity detection.

system with constant-speed unicycle robots (CSUR). The work is motivated by the
limitation of the conventional method that does not ensure the satisfaction of
hard state- and input-dependent constraints and leads to feasibility issues for
multi-CSUR systems. In this paper, we solve these problems by designing a novel
coverage cost function and a saturated gradient-search-based control law.
Invariant set theory and Lyapunov-based techniques are used to prove the
state-dependent confinement and the convergence of the system state to the
optimal coverage configuration, respectively. The controller is implemented in
a distributed manner based on a novel communication standard among the agents.
A series of simulation case studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness
of the proposed coverage controller in different initial conditions and with
control parameters. A comparison study in simulation reveals the advantage of
the proposed method in terms of avoiding infeasibility. The experiment study
verifies the applicability of the method to real robots with uncertainties. The
development procedure of the method from theoretical analysis to experimental
validation provides a novel framework for multi-agent system coordinate control
with complex agent dynamics.

viscous stress terms possible. We present a novel method of reconstructing the
pressure fields from error-embedded pressure gradient measurement data. This
method utilized Green's function of the Laplacian operator as the convolution

the boundary offers equations to solve for the boundary pressure. This Green's

equivalent to ODI in the limit of an infinite number of line integral paths,
GFI spares the necessity of line integration along zigzag integral paths,
rendering generalized implementation schemes for both two and three-dimensional

efficiency. In the current work, we apply GFI to pressure reconstruction of
simple canonical and isotropic turbulence flows embedded with error in
two-dimensional and three-dimensional domains, respectively. Uncertainty

model with a subset of the target population.Methods: A literature review was
conducted to select an adequate population pharmacokinetic model (L).
Pharmacokinetic data from therapeutic drug monitoring of tacrolimus in
liver-transplanted adults were retrospectively collected. A subset of these
data (70%) was exploited to tweak the L-model using the PRIOR subroutine of the
NONMEM software, with 2 strategies to weight the prior information: full
informative (F) and optimized (O). An external evaluation was performed on the
remaining data; bias and imprecision were evaluated for predictions a priori
and Bayesian forecasting.Results: Seventy-nine patients (851 concentrations)
were enrolled in the study. The predictive performance of L-model was
insufficient for a priori predictions, whereas it was acceptable with Bayesian
forecasting, from the third prediction (ie, with $\ge$2 previously observed
concentrations), corresponding to 1 week after transplantation. Overall, the
tweaked models showed a better predictive ability than the L-model. The bias of
a priori predictions was --41% with the literature model versus --28.5% and
--8.73% with tweaked F and O models, respectively. The imprecision was 45.4%
with the literature model versus 38.0% and 39.2% with tweaked F and O models,
respectively. For Bayesian predictions, whatever the forecasting state, the
tweaked models tend to obtain better results.Conclusions: A pharmacokinetic
model can be used, and to improve the predictive performance, tweaking the
literature model with the PRIOR approach allows to obtain better predictions.

area for non-stationary vehicular scenarios. Therefore we propose a deep neural
network (DNN) for predicting the expected frame error rate (FER). The DNN is
trained in a supervised fashion, where a time-limited sequence of channel
frequency responses has been labeled with its corresponding FER values assuming
an underlying wireless communication system, i.e. IEEE 802.11p. For generating
the training dataset we use a geometry-based stochastic channel model (GSCM).
We obtain the ground truth FER by emulating the time-varying frequency
responses using a hardware-in-the-loop setup. Our GSCM provides the propagation
path parameters which we use to fix the statistics of the fading process at one
point in space for an arbitrary amount of time, enabling accurate FER
estimation. Using this dataset we achieve an accuracy of 85% of the DNN. We use
the trained model to predict the FER for measured time-varying channel transfer
functions obtained during a measurement campaign. We compare the predicted
output of the DNN to the measured FER on the road and obtain a prediction
accuracy of 78%.

volume in the Complexity=Volume proposal. In this paper, we investigate
generalized volume-complexity for the 4-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m-AdS
black hole. These new observables satisfy the characteristic of the thermofield
double state, i.e., they grow linearly in time on the late stage. We find that
there are multiple extremal hypersurfaces anchored at a certain boundary time.
In other words, for the same boundary time, more than one observable
(generalized volume) can exist in the bulk. The size relationship of the
observables on the two hypersurfaces changes over time. This will result in the
substitution of the maximum extreme hypersurface which is dual to the
complexity of the thermofield double state. We call the time when one
hypersurface replaces another to become the largest extreme hypersurface the
turning time $\tau _{turning}$. That is, a hypersurface dual to the complexity
of the thermofield double state defined on the boundary jumps from one branch
to another. This discontinuous jump is highly reminiscent of a phase
transition, and the turning time denotes the moment at which this phase
transition occurs. Our findings propose a discontinuous variation in bulk
physics that is dual to the complexity of the thermofield double state defined
on the boundary.

integrity of automated face recognition systems. Despite substantial
advancements, the generalization of existing approaches to real-world

scarcity and lack of diversity in publicly available FAS datasets, which often
leads to overfitting during training or saturation during testing. In terms of
quantity, the number of spoof subjects is a critical determinant. Most datasets
comprise fewer than 2,000 subjects. With regard to diversity, the majority of
datasets consist of spoof samples collected in controlled environments using
repetitive, mechanical processes. This data collection methodology results in
homogenized samples and a dearth of scenario diversity. To address these
shortcomings, we introduce the Wild Face Anti-Spoofing (WFAS) dataset, a
large-scale, diverse FAS dataset collected in unconstrained settings. Our
dataset encompasses 853,729 images of 321,751 spoof subjects and 529,571 images
of 148,169 live subjects, representing a substantial increase in quantity.
Moreover, our dataset incorporates spoof data obtained from the internet,
spanning a wide array of scenarios and various commercial sensors, including 17
presentation attacks (PAs) that encompass both 2D and 3D forms. This novel data
collection strategy markedly enhances FAS data diversity. Leveraging the WFAS
dataset and Protocol 1 (Known-Type), we host the Wild Face Anti-Spoofing
Challenge at the CVPR2023 workshop. Additionally, we meticulously evaluate
representative methods using Protocol 1 and Protocol 2 (Unknown-Type). Through
an in-depth examination of the challenge outcomes and benchmark baselines, we
provide insightful analyses and propose potential avenues for future research.

learning approaches with the large-scale manually annotated dataset. However,
it's very difficult and expensive to collect a large amount of well-labeled
data for system building. In this paper, we propose a novel and advanced
self-supervised learning framework which can construct a high performance
speaker verification system without using any labeled data. To avoid the impact
of false negative pairs, we adopt the self-distillation with no labels (DINO)
framework as the initial model, which can be trained without exploiting
negative pairs. Then, we introduce a cluster-aware training strategy for DINO
to improve the diversity of data. In the iteration learning stage, due to a
mass of unreliable labels from clustering, the quality of pseudo labels is
important for the system training. This motivates us to propose dynamic
loss-gate and label correction (DLG-LC) methods to alleviate the performance
degradation caused by unreliable labels. More specifically, we model the loss
distribution with GMM and obtain the loss-gate threshold dynamically to
distinguish the reliable and unreliable labels. Besides, we adopt the model
predictions to correct the unreliable label, for better utilizing the
unreliable data rather than dropping them directly. Moreover, we extend the
DLG-LC to multi-modality to further improve the performance. The experiments
are performed on the commonly used Voxceleb dataset. Compared to the best-known
self-supervised speaker verification system, our proposed method obtain 22.17%,
27.94% and 25.56% relative EER improvement on Vox-O, Vox-E and Vox-H test sets,
even with fewer iterations, smaller models, and simpler clustering methods.
More importantly, the newly proposed system even achieves comparable results
with the fully supervised system, but without using any human labeled data.

liquid-biopsy-based approaches, as cell-free DNA retains information related to
its cell of origin. In this work, I leverage a recently profiled collection of
cell-sorted whole genome bisulfite profiles of 44 healthy cell types. The high
quality and purity of such data provide an ideal basis for discovering and
characterizing discriminative DNA methylation regions that could serve as a
reference for computational deconvolution. First, I characterize differentially
methylated regions between every pair of cell types, obtaining a meaningful
measure of divergence. Pairwise differences were then aggregated to identify a
set of uniquely (de)methylated regions (UMRs) for each cell type. Identified
UMRs are predominantly hypomethylated and their numbers vary significantly
across cell types. They are mostly located in enhancer regions and strongly
support cell-type-specific characteristics. As mapping onto UMRs has proven
unsuitable for deconvolution, I developed a novel approach utilizing the set
cover algorithm to select discriminative regions for this purpose. Based on
these regions, deconvolution was performed in two distinct approaches: a
beta-value-based and a read-level one. Both approaches outperform an existing
deconvolution software modeled on the same data 3-fold in terms of total
deconvolution error. Surprisingly, the beta-based approach slightly
outperformed the read-level one. Overall, I present an adaptable, end-to-end
software solution (methylcover) for obtaining accurate cell type deconvolution,

particularly as it relates to the interplay of identity, organizational, and

languaging as an analytic lens to describe how technology and design
practitioners negotiate their conception of ethics as they reflect upon their
everyday work. We engaged twelve practitioners in individual co-creation
workshops, encouraging them to reflect on their ethical role in their everyday
work through a series of generative and evaluative activities. We analyzed
these data to identify how each practitioner reasoned about ethics through
language and artifacts, finding that practitioners used a range of rhetorical
tropes to describe their ethical commitments and beliefs in ways that were
complex and sometimes contradictory. Across three cases, we describe how ethics
was negotiated through language across three key zones of ecological emergence:
the practitioner's ""core"" beliefs about ethics, internal and external
ecological elements that shaped or mediated these core beliefs, and the

cluster NGC 1027 using $UBV(RI)_c$ and Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) data.
Structural and fundamental parameters such as cluster center, cluster extent,
reddening, age and distance are estimated in this study. Cluster center is
found about 2 arcmin away from the center reported earlier. Radius has been
estimated to be about 8.00 arcmin(2.65pc). Using proper motion Gaia EDR3 data,
membership probabilities has been derived for the stars in the region of
cluster radius. We find mean proper motion of the cluster to be $\sim$(-0.84,
2.04) mas yr$^{-1}$ in (RA, DEC). We find 217 most probable (P$_\mu>$ 70\%)
cluster members with mean parallax 0.892 $\pm$ 0.088 mas. Out of these, 160
members have counterparts in our optical observations. Few stars having
P$_\mu>$ 70\% are found out of the cluster radius showing imprints of dynamical
evolution. The color-color and color-magnitude diagrams for the cluster members
found within 8.00 arcmin have been constructed using $UBV(RI)_c$ photometry and
Gaia EDR3 data. This yields a reddening E($B$-$V$) $\sim$ 0.36 mag, age $\sim$
130 Myr and distance $\sim$ 1.14 kpc. The mass function slope in the cluster
region is $\Gamma$ $\sim$ -1.46 $\pm$ 0.15, which is similar to other Galactic
open clusters. The dynamical study shows lack of faint stars in its inner
region leading to mass segregation effect. A comparison of dynamical age with
cluster age indicates that NGC 1027 is a dynamically relaxed cluster suggesting
that mass segregation may be imprint of its dynamical relaxation.

existence of a third action for one of the players, although not used, allows
both players to coordinate on one Nash equilibrium. This Nash equilibrium is
the one preferred by, at least, the player with access to the new action. This

ability to independently replicate experimental results by analysing the same

proposed to make the results of the experiments actually reproducible. However,
very few address the importance of data reproducibility, defined as the ability
of independent researchers to retain the same dataset used as input for
experimentation. Properly addressing the problem of data reproducibility is
crucial because often just providing a link to the data is not enough to make
the results reproducible. In fact, also proper metadata (e.g., preprocessing
instruction) must be provided to make a dataset fully reproducible. In this
work, our aim is to fill this gap by proposing a decision tree to sheperd
researchers through the reproducibility of their datasets. In particular, this
decision tree guides researchers through identifying if the dataset is actually
reproducible and if additional metadata (i.e., additional resources needed to
reproduce the data) must also be provided. This decision tree will be the
foundation of a future application that will automate the data reproduction
process by automatically providing the necessary metadata based on the
particular context (e.g., data availability, data preprocessing, and so on). It
is worth noting that, in this paper, we detail the steps to make a dataset

stars is dominated by super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. These planets are,
however, missing in our Solar System, and the reason for that is unknown. Two
theoretical scenarios invoke the role of Jupiter as the possible culprit:
Jupiter may have acted as a dynamical barrier to the inward migration of
sub-Neptunes from beyond the water iceline or, alternatively, may have reduced
considerably the inward flux of material (pebbles) required to form
super-Earths inside that iceline. Both scenarios predict an anti-correlation
between the presence of small planets (SPs) and that of cold Jupiters (CJs) in
exoplanetary systems. To test that prediction, we homogeneously analyzed the
radial-velocity (RV) measurements of 38 Kepler and K2 transiting SP systems
gathered over almost 10 years with the HARPS-N spectrograph, as well as
publicly available RVs collected with other facilities. We detected five CJs in
three systems, two in Kepler-68, two in Kepler-454, and a very eccentric one in
K2-312. We derived an occurrence rate of $9.3^{+7.7}_{-2.9}\%$ for CJs with
$0.3-13~M_{Jup}$ and 1-10 au, which is lower but still compatible at
$1.3\sigma$ with that measured from RV surveys for solar-type stars, regardless
of SP presence. This does not allow us to draw a firm conclusion about the
predicted anti-correlation between SPs and CJs, which would require a
considerably larger sample. Nevertheless, we found no evidence of previous
claims of an excess of CJs in SP systems. As an important by-product of our
analyses, we homogeneously determined the masses of 64 Kepler and K2 small

Traditional DCs barely satisfy those demands because of their inherent

promise to meet the increasing network requirements for cloud applications by
decoupling control functionalities from data forwarding. Although SDN solutions
add more flexibility to DC networks, they also pose new vulnerabilities with a
high impact due to the centralised architecture. In this paper we propose an
evaluation framework for assessing the security level of SDN architectures in
four different stages. Furthermore, we show in an experimental study, how the
framework can be used for mapping SDN threats with associated vulnerabilities
and necessary mitigations in conjunction with risk and impact classification.
The proposed framework helps administrators to evaluate the network security
level, to apply countermeasures for identified SDN threats, and to meet the

of BNS mergers, and estimate the distribution functions of kilonova peak
luminosities (KLFs) at the u, g, r, i, y, and z bands as well as its dependence
on the NS EOS, by adopting a comprehensive semi-analytical model for kilonovae
(calibrated by the observations of GW170817), a population synthesis model for

assuming a stiff/soft (DD2/SLy) EOS. The emission of the kilonovae in the KLF
bright components is mostly due to the radiation from the wind ejecta by the

faint components is mostly due to the radiation from the dynamical ejecta by

  Propulsion","Accepted for publication in the Physics of Plasmas",,"10.1063/5.0141622",,"physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Space propulsion is unique among many proposed applications of the Dense
Plasma Focus in being critically dependent on the availability of a scaling
theory that is well-grounded in physics, in conformity with existing
experimental knowledge and applicable to experimentally untested
configurations. This paper derives such a first-principles-based scaling theory
and illustrates its application to a novel space propulsion concept, where the
plasma focus sheath is employed as a power density amplifying mechanism to
transport electric energy from a capacitive storage to a current-driven fusion
load. For this purpose, a Generalized Plasma Focus problem is introduced and
formulated. It concerns a finite, axisymmetric plasma, driven through a neutral
gas at supersonic speed over distances much larger than its typical gradient
scale length by its azimuthal magnetic field while remaining connected with its
pulse power source through suitable boundaries. The Gratton-Vargas equation is
rederived from the scaling properties of the equations governing plasma
dynamics and solved for algebraically defined initial (insulator) and boundary
(anode) surfaces. Scaling relations for a new space propulsion concept are
derived. This consists of a modified plasma focus with a tapered anode that
transports current from a pulsed power source to a consumable portion of the
anode in the form of a hypodermic needle tube continuously extruded along the
axis of the device. When the tube is filled with deuterium, the device may
serve as a small-scale version of magnetized liner inertial fusion (MAGLIF)
that could avoid failure of neutron yield scaling in a conventional plasma
focus.

that modify the oscillator's natural frequency. One of the parameters can be
the damping rate. The exceptional point then corresponds to critical damping of
the oscillator. This situation is illustrated by the Caldeira--Leggett (CL)
equation and the Markovian limit of the Hu--Paz--Zhang (HPZ) equation. The
other parameter changes the oscillator's effective mass whereby the exceptional
point is reached in the limit of extremely heavy oscillator. This situation is

We do this by confronting the predictions of the model, in particular the
formation of a solitonic core at the centre of dark matter haloes, with a
homogeneous and robust sample of high-resolution rotation curves from the
``LITTLE THINGS in 3D'' catalog. This comprises a collection of isolated, dark
matter dominated dwarf-irregular galaxies that provides an optimal benchmark
for cosmological studies. We use a statistical framework based on Markov-Chain
Monte Carlo techniques that allows us to extract relevant parameters such as
the axion mass, the mass of the solitonic core, the mass of the dark matter
halo and its concentration parameter with a rather loose set of priors except
for the implementation of a core-halo relation that is predicted by
simulations. The results of the fits are used to perform various diagnostics on
the predictions of the model. FDM provides an excellent fit to the rotation
curves of the ``LITTLE THINGS in 3D'' catalog, with axion masses determined
from different galaxies clustering around $m_a\approx2\times10^{-23}$ eV.
However we find two major problems in our analysis. First, the data follow
scaling relations of the properties of the core which are not consistent with
the predictions of the soliton. This problem is particularly acute in the core
radius - mass relation with a tension that, at face value, has a significance
$\gtrsim5\sigma$. The second problem is related to the strong suppression of
the linear power spectrum that is predicted by FDM for the axion mass preferred
by the data. This can be constrained very conservatively by the galaxy counts
in our sample, which leads to a tension exceeding again $5\sigma$. We estimate
the effects of baryons in our analysis and discuss whether they could alleviate
the tensions of the model with observations.

for optimizing cryostorage processes of biological tissue, food, and
protein-based drugs. One of the major challenges is related to the formation of
ice nanocrystals which can occur even in the presence of cryoprotectants and
can lead to protein denaturation. Here, using a combination of small- and
wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS), we investigate the structural
evolution of concentrated Lysozyme solutions in a cryoprotected glycerol-water
mixture upon cooling from room temperature (T=300 K) down to cryogenic
temperatures (T=195 K). Upon cooling, we observe a transition near the melting
temperature of the solution (T~245 K), which manifests both in the temperature
dependence of the scattering intensity peak position reflecting protein-protein
length scales (SAXS) and the interatomic distances within the solvent (WAXS).
Upon thermal cycling, a hysteresis is observed in the scattering intensity,
which is attributed to the formation of nanocrystallites in the order of 10 nm.
The experimental data is well described by the two-Yukawa model, which
indicates temperature-dependent changes in the short-range attraction of the
protein-protein interaction potential. Our results demonstrate that the
nanocrystal growth yields effectively stronger protein-protein attraction and
influences the protein pair distribution function beyond the first coordination
shell.

This paper considers transferring this ""force-visualization"" ability to robots.
We hypothesize that a rough force distribution (named ""force map"") can be
utilized for object manipulation strategies even if accurate force estimation
is impossible. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a training method to
predict the force map from vision. To investigate this hypothesis, we generated
scenes where objects were stacked in bulk through simulation and trained a
model to predict the contact force from a single image. We further applied
domain randomization to make the trained model function on real images. The
experimental results showed that the model trained using only synthetic images
could predict approximate patterns representing the contact areas of the
objects even for real images. Then, we designed a simple algorithm to plan a
lifting direction using the predicted force distribution. We confirmed that
using the predicted force distribution contributes to finding natural lifting
directions for typical real-world scenes. Furthermore, the evaluation through
simulations showed that the disturbance caused to surrounding objects was
reduced by 26 % (translation displacement) and by 39 % (angular displacement)
for scenes where objects were overlapping.

gentle to objects with different shapes, requires little pushing force, and
increases gripping strength only when necessary. We present the design,

increase stiffness to lift heavy objects with a maximum gripping force of
$17\,$N and grip-to-pinch force ratio of $42$. We also explore different

However, this is extremely time-consuming when applied to the new large and

machine learning trained on an existing sample of remnant candidates. For a
dataset of 4107 radio sources, with angular sizes larger than 60 arcsec, from
the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-Metre Sky Survey second data release
(LoTSS-DR2), we started with 151 radio sources that were visually classified as

all radio sources from their corresponding Stokes-I images: from simple source
catalogue-derived properties, to clustered Haralick-features, and
self-organising map (SOM) derived morphological features. We trained a random
forest classifier to separate the 'AGN remnant candidates' from the not yet
inspected sources. The SOM-derived features and the total to peak flux ratio of
a source are shown to be most salient to the classifier. We estimate that
$31\pm5\%$ of sources with positive predictions from our classifier will be
labelled 'AGN remnant candidates' upon visual inspection, while we estimate the
upper bound of the $95\%$ confidence interval for 'AGN remnant candidates' in

performs optimization based on a server and a group of workers, in which the
server dispatches a large task to workers. Workers search for promising
solutions through EC optimizers and cooperate with connected neighbors. To
eliminate uncertainties brought by the heterogeneity of worker behaviors and
devices, the server adopts the competitive ranking and uncertainty detection
strategy to guide the cooperation of workers. To illustrate the satisfactory

non-convex gradient-free optimization in subspace, which significantly
accelerates the optimization process with negligible performance loss.

Sun have low activity levels and smooth cycles with occasional grand minima.
We, for the first time, try to model these observational trends using flux

models of one solar mass star with different rotation rates. Differential
rotation and meridional circulation are specified with a mean-field
hydrodynamic model. We include stochastic fluctuations in the Babcock-Leighton
source of the poloidal field to capture the inherent fluctuations in the
stellar convection. Based on extensive simulations, we find that rapidly
rotating stars produce highly irregular cycles with strong magnetic fields and
rarely produce Maunder-like grand minima, whereas the slowly-rotating stars
(with a rotation period of 10 days and longer) produce smooth cycles of weaker
strength, long-term modulation in the amplitude, and occasional extended grand
minima. The average duration and the frequency of grand minima increase with
decreasing rotation rate. These results can be understood as the tendency of
less supercritical dynamo in slower rotating stars to be more prone to produce
extended grand minima

images is challenging due to the small size of the foreground data (i.e., power
lines) and the abundance of background information. To address this challenge,
we propose DUFormer, a semantic segmentation algorithm designed specifically
for power line detection in aerial images. We assume that performing sufficient
feature extraction with a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has a strong
inductive bias is beneficial for training an efficient Transformer model. To
this end, we propose a heavy token encoder responsible for overlapping feature
re-mining and tokenization. The encoder comprises a pyramid CNN feature
extraction module and a power line feature enhancement module. Following
sufficient feature extraction for power lines, the feature fusion is carried
out, and then the Transformer block is used for global modeling. The final
segmentation result is obtained by fusing local and global features in the
decode head. Additionally, we demonstrate the significance of the joint
multi-weight loss function in power line segmentation. The experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance

ability to explore superior local models and ignore the valuable information in
historical models. Besides, although the up-to-date representation method
simultaneously concerns the global and historical local models, it suffers from
unbearable computation cost. To accelerate convergence with low resource
consumption, we innovatively propose a model regularization method named
FedTrip, which is designed to restrict global-local divergence and decrease
current-historical correlation for alleviating the negative effects derived
from data heterogeneity. FedTrip helps the current local model to be close to
the global model while keeping away from historical local models, which
contributes to guaranteeing the consistency of local updates among clients and
efficiently exploring superior local models with negligible additional
computation cost on attaching operations. Empirically, we demonstrate the
superiority of FedTrip via extensive evaluations. To achieve the target

environment. However, recent observations have challenged this traditional
view. High spatial and spectral resolution observations of the Orion Molecular
Cloud and an infrared dark cloud G35.39 show a resolution-dependent turbulence,
and that high-mass stars are forming exclusively in subsonic to transonic cores
in those clouds. These studies demand a re-evaluation of the role of the
turbulence in massive star formation. Aims. We aim to study the turbulence in a
typical massive star-forming region G35.20-0.74 N with a sufficient spatial
resolution to resolve the thermal Jeans length, and a spectral resolution to
resolve the thermal linewidth. Methods. We use the ALMA dust continuum emission
to resolve fragmentation, JVLA 1.2 cm continuum to trace ionized gas, and JVLA
NH3 (1,1) to (7,7) inversion transition lines to trace linewidth, temperature,
and dynamics. We fit those lines and remove line broadening due to channel
width, thermal pressure, and velocity gradient to obtain a clean map of
intrinsic turbulence. Results. We find that (1) the turbulence in G35.20 is
overall supersonic, with mean and median Mach numbers 3.7 and 2.8,
respectively. (2) Mach number decreases from 6-7 at 0.1 pc scale to <3 towards
the central cores at 0.01 pc scale. (3) The central ALMA cores appear to be
decoupled form the host filament, evident by an opposite velocity gradient and
significantly reduced turbulence. Because of intense star formation activities
in G35.20 (as compared to the relatively young and quiescent IRDC G35.39), the
supersonic turbulence is likely replenished by protostellar outflows. G35.20
is, thus, representative of an evolved form of IRDC G35.39. More observations
of a sample of IRDCs are highly demanded to further investigate the role of
turbulence in initial conditions for the massive star formation.

Through modelling the star formation histories of our objects, we derive a
broad dynamical range of post-quenching timescales ($60\:\rm Myr<t_{\rm

central quest for implementing realistic quantum computation. However, many of
the most promising approaches to this problem rely on hypotheses that may not
reflect practical physical scenarios, like knowing the exact dynamics of the
qubit-environment system or being able to store an informational qubit in
multiple physical qubits. Here, we step away from these usual assumptions and
analyze the probability of successfully storing a classical bit of information
on a physical qubit during a single computational step, both for the case in
which the qubit evolves freely and also when it is subject to a sequence of
repeated measurements. The setup consists of a qubit coupled to a heat bath at
finite temperature, whose dynamics is given by a generalized amplitude damping
channel in a pointer basis that does not necessarily coincide with the
computational basis of the qubit. We first show that requiring the dynamics to
be Markovian implies an exponential decay of the pointer basis' populations.
Then, we obtain the success probability as function of time and angle
$\theta_0$ between the initial state of the qubit and the ground state of the
pointer basis. Finally, we calculate these probabilities for the Zeno effective
dynamics and show that they are never larger than those for the free evolution,
implying that a repeated measurements protocol cannot improve the probability
of a successful storage in our model. This last result indicates that to
perform realistic quantum computation, when information is being continuously
lost to the environment, the information must be somehow driven back into the

crucial for interfacing different quantum nodes with varied frequencies and

superconducting quantum circuits that can generate propagating single photons,
time-bin encoded photonic qubits and qudits. In particular, the frequency of
the emitted photons can be tuned in situ as large as 200 MHz. Even though the
internal quantum efficiency of the light source is sensitive to the working

well preserved with the time-bin encoding scheme. Our work thus demonstrates a
versatile approach to realizing a practical quantum light source for future

introduce systematic redshift errors, and in extreme cases produce
misclassifications. We quantitatively investigate the impact of BAL features on
quasar classifications and redshift measurements with synthetic spectra that
were designed to match observations by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument
(DESI) survey. Over the course of five years, DESI aims to measure spectra for
40 million galaxies and quasars, including nearly three million quasars. Our
synthetic quasar spectra match the signal-to-noise ratio and redshift
distributions of the first year of DESI observations, and include the same
synthetic quasar spectra both with and without BAL features. We demonstrate
that masking the locations of the BAL features decreases the redshift errors by
about 1\% and reduces the number of catastrophic redshift errors by about 80\%.
We conclude that identifying and masking BAL troughs should be a standard part
of the redshift determination step for DESI and other large-scale spectroscopic

for conditional behavior prediction rely on a regression decoder, meaning that
coordinates or polynomial coefficients are regressed. In this work we revisit
set-based trajectory prediction, where the probability of each trajectory in a
predefined trajectory set is determined by a classification model, and
first-time employ it to the task of conditional behavior prediction. We propose
RESET, which combines a new metric-driven algorithm for trajectory set
generation with a graph-based encoder. For unconditional prediction, RESET
achieves comparable performance to a regression-based approach. Due to the
nature of set-based approaches, it has the advantageous property of being able
to predict a flexible number of trajectories without influencing runtime or
complexity. For conditional prediction, RESET achieves reasonable results with
late fusion of the planned trajectory, which was not observed for
regression-based approaches before. This means that RESET is computationally
lightweight to combine with a planner that proposes multiple future plans of
the autonomous vehicle, as large parts of the forward pass can be reused.

two-mode nonlinear systems - relevant to optical Kerr cavities, waveguides and
Bose-Einstein condensates - where we find an emergent four-wave mixing
nonlinearity, which originates from pair-hopping processes in the parent
quantum picture. Tuning this drive-induced nonlinearity is shown to modify the

enables effective navigation to generate an object texture for a given 3D
object geometry that matches to an input RGB image, which maintains robustness
even under challenging real-world scenarios where the mesh geometry
approximates an inexact match to the underlying geometry in the RGB image.
Mesh2Tex can effectively generate realistic object textures for an object mesh

validate and compare their performance. Currently established metrics are based
on Euclidean distance, which means that errors are weighted equally in all
directions. Euclidean metrics are insufficient for structured environments like
roads, since they do not properly capture the agent's intent relative to the
underlying lane. In order to provide a reasonable assessment of trajectory
prediction approaches with regard to the downstream planning task, we propose a
new metric that is lane distance-based: Lane Miss Rate (LMR). For the
calculation of LMR, the ground-truth and predicted endpoints are assigned to
lane segments, more precisely their centerlines. Measured by the distance along
the lane segments, predictions that are within a certain threshold distance to
the ground-truth count as hits, otherwise they count as misses. LMR is then
defined as the ratio of sequences that yield a miss. Our results on three
state-of-the-art trajectory prediction models show that LMR preserves the order
of Euclidean distance-based metrics. In contrast to the Euclidean Miss Rate,
qualitative results show that LMR yields misses for sequences where predictions
are located on wrong lanes. Hits on the other hand result for sequences where
predictions are located on the correct lane. This means that LMR implicitly
weights Euclidean error relative to the lane and goes into the direction of
capturing intents of traffic agents. The source code of LMR for Argoverse 2 is
publicly available.

considering the static spherically symmetric case, extending next the study to
static axially symmetric case. Afterward we consider the non--static
spherically symmetric case. Two possible modes of evolution are proposed to be
the simplest one. One is the homologous conditio,, however, as was shown later
on, it may be useful to relax this last condition to enlarge the set of
possible solutions, by adopting the so-called quasi-homologous condition. As
another example of symmetry, we consider fluids endowed with hyperbolical
symmetry. Exact solutions for static fluid distributions satisfying the
condition of minimal complexity are presented.. An extension of the complexity
factor to the vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations represented by the

ranging from the Minkowski spacetime (the simplest one) to gravitationally
radiating systems (the most complex). Finally we propose a list of questions

calculated thermodynamic quantities of the cycle in terms of the transition
probabilities between the instantaneous energy eigenstates, and also between
the instantaneous energy eigenstates and the basis states of the measurement,
when the unitary stages of the cycle operate for a finite time $\tau$. The
efficiency attains a large value in the limit of $\tau \rightarrow 0$ and then
gradually reaches the adiabatic value in a long time limit $\tau \rightarrow
\infty$. For finite values of $\tau$ and for anisotropic interaction, an
oscillatory behaviour of the efficiency of the engine is observed. This
oscillation can be interpreted in terms of interference between the relevant
transition amplitudes in the unitary stages of the engine cycle. Therefore, for
a suitable choice of timing of the unitary processes in the short time regime,
the engine can have a higher work output and less heat absorption, such that it
works more efficiently than a quasi-static engine. In the case of an always-on

art retrieval methods. Examples are heavy illumination changes (e.g. night-time
images) or substantial occlusions (e.g. transient objects). In this work we
explore whether re-ranking methods based on spatial verification can tackle
these challenges, following the intuition that local descriptors are inherently
more robust than global features to domain shifts. To this end, we provide a
new, comprehensive benchmark on current state of the art models. We also
introduce two new demanding datasets with night and occluded queries, to be
matched against a city-wide database. Code and datasets are available at

in polynomial time and, with probability $1-o(1)$, has additive error
$\widetilde{O}(\frac{\Delta^*\ln\ln n}{\varepsilon}),$ where $\Delta^*$ is the
smallest possible maximum degree of a spanning forest of $G.$
Node-differentially private algorithms are known only for a small number of

the number of connected components is that this graph statistic is not robust
to adding one node with arbitrary connections (a change that node-differential
privacy is designed to hide): every graph is a neighbor of a connected graph.
  We overcome this by designing a family of efficiently computable Lipschitz
extensions of the number of connected components or, equivalently, the size of
a spanning forest. The construction of the extensions, which is at the core of
our algorithm, is based on the forest polytope of $G.$ We prove several
combinatorial facts about spanning forests, in particular, that a graph with no
induced $\Delta$-stars has a spanning forest of degree at most $\Delta$. With
this fact, we show that our Lipschitz extensions for the number of connected
components equal the true value of the function for the largest possible
monotone families of graphs. More generally, on all monotone sets of graphs,
the $\ell_\infty$ error of our Lipschitz extensions is nearly optimal.

merger rates at the age of the Universe today. We consider two possible
scenarios for the dynamics of the dressed binaries: assuming that either the DM
spikes are completely evaporated from the binaries before merger or they remain
static until the merger. Contrary to previous studies, we find that the
presence of spikes may increase or decrease the present-day PBH merger rates,
in some cases dramatically. Comparing with merger rates reported by the LVK

derive approximate constraints on the fraction of Solar-mass PBHs in cold dark

mass function. Our calculations are valid only for the idealized scenarios in
which the DM spikes are either evaporated or static. However, they suggest that
the impact of DM spikes on PBH merger rates may be more complicated than
previously thought and motivate the development of a more general description
of the merger dynamics, including feedback of the DM spikes in highly eccentric

120-168 MHz band, and from the uGMRT at 250-500 and 550-900 MHz. We also
complement the radio data with Chandra X-ray observations to compare the

is visible up to 3.0 GHz and has an integrated spectral index of
$-1.24\pm0.03$, with a steepening from $-0.89\pm0.03$ to $-1.39\pm0.03$. These

radio relic. We also find a linear/super-linear correlation between the

three different classifiers, convolutional neural networks, support vector

support vectors and feature selection; even though it may only yield relatively
modest changes to global metrics, such as balanced accuracy or F1 measure. We
hypothesize that DA works by facilitating variances in data, so that machine

the range of feature amplitudes that a model must recognize to predict a label,
DA improves a model's capacity to generalize when learning with imbalanced

structure (EIS) caused by the radiation luminosity being close to the Eddington
luminosity in the iron opacity peak region of H-free WR stars may be the key to
resolve the radius problem of H-free WR stars. We try to explain the H-free WR
stars observed in the Milk Way (MW) and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) by the
He stars. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics code, we
compute the evolution of He stars with and without MLT++ prescriptions and
discuss their effects on the EIS. We have calculated the evolution of He stars
using a new mass-loss rate formula and three different relative rotational
velocity and compared our results with observations on Hertzsprung-Russell
diagrams. The low luminosity (log$(L/L_{{\odot}})\leq5.2$) H-free WR stars in
the MW and the LMC can be explained by the helium giant phase in low-mass He
stars, the high $X_{C}$ and $X_{O}$ in WC stars can only evolve through
low-mass He stars with a rapid rotation. High-mass He stars with the EIS can
explain H-free WR stars with a luminosity exceeding $10^{5.7} L_{{\odot}}$ and
an effective temperature above $10^{4.7}$ K in the MW. They can also explain
H-free WR stars on the right-hand side of the He zero-age main sequence in the
LMC. High-mass stars with the EIS evolve into WO stars at the final evolution
stage, and the shorter lifetime fraction is consistent with the small number of
observed WO stars.

assess the alteration in global topology of the brain white-matter structural
covariance network for child participants. We use persistent homology, an
algebraic technique in TDA, to analyze topological features in the brain
covariance networks constructed from structural magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We develop a novel framework for
statistical inference based on the Wasserstein distance to assess the
significance of the observed topological differences. Using these methods in
comparing maltreated children to a typically developing sample, we find that
maltreatment may increase homogeneity in white matter structures and thus
induce higher correlations in the structural covariance; this is reflected in
the topological profile. Our findings strongly demonstrates that TDA can be
used as a baseline framework to model altered topological structures of the
brain.

present a variational, sign-problem-free Monte Carlo method for lattice gauge
theories with continuous gauge groups and apply it to (2+1)-dimensional compact
QED with dynamical fermions at finite density. The variational ansatz is
formulated in the full gauge field basis, i.e. without having to resort to
truncation schemes for the $U(1)$ gauge field Hilbert space. The ansatz
consists of two parts: first, a pure gauge part based on Jastrow-type ansatz
states (which can be connected to certain neural-network ansatz states) and
secondly, on a fermionic part based on gauge-field dependent fermionic Gaussian
states. These are designed in such a way that the gauge field integral over all
fermionic Gaussian states is gauge-invariant and at the same time still
efficiently tractable. To ensure the validity of the method we benchmark the
pure gauge part of the ansatz against another variational method and the full
ansatz against an existing Monte Carlo simulation where the sign-problem is
absent. Moreover, in limiting cases where the exact ground state is known we
show that our ansatz is able to capture this behavior. Finally, we study a

promising potential for learning scalable visual representations. In typical
approaches, models usually focus on predicting specific contents of masked
patches, and their performances are highly related to pre-defined mask
strategies. Intuitively, this procedure can be considered as training a student
(the model) on solving given problems (predict masked patches). However, we
argue that the model should not only focus on solving given problems, but also
stand in the shoes of a teacher to produce a more challenging problem by
itself. To this end, we propose Hard Patches Mining (HPM), a brand-new
framework for MIM pre-training. We observe that the reconstruction loss can
naturally be the metric of the difficulty of the pre-training task. Therefore,
we introduce an auxiliary loss predictor, predicting patch-wise losses first
and deciding where to mask next. It adopts a relative relationship learning
strategy to prevent overfitting to exact reconstruction loss values.
Experiments under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of HPM in
constructing masked images. Furthermore, we empirically find that solely
introducing the loss prediction objective leads to powerful representations,
verifying the efficacy of the ability to be aware of where is hard to
reconstruct.

The solution to the dispersion relation with the input from the perturbative

with the $b$ quark mass $m_b=4.43$ GeV demands a specific Higgs mass 114 GeV.
Our observation offers an alternative resolution to the long-standing
fine-tuning problem of the Standard Model (SM): the Higgs mass is determined
dynamically for the internal consistency of the SM. The similar formalism, as
applied to the correlation function of two $b$-quark vector currents with the
same $m_b$, leads to the $Z$ boson mass 90.8 GeV. This solution exists only
when the $Z$ and $W$ boson masses are proportionate, conforming to the Higgs

is extended to a wider region by analytic continuation. For $N=1$, this Lambert
series plays an important role in string theory scattering amplitudes as can be
seen in the recent work of Dorigoni and Kleinschmidt. These transformations
exhibit several identities - a new generalization of Ramanujan's formula for
$\zeta(2m+1)$, an identity associated with extended higher Herglotz functions,
generalized Dedekind eta-transformation, Wigert's transformation etc., all of
which are derived in this paper, thus leading to their uniform proofs. A
special case of one of these explicit transformations naturally leads us to
consider generalized power partitions with ``$n^{2N-1}$ copies of $n^{N}$''.
Asymptotic expansion of their generating function as $q\to1^{-}$ is also
derived which generalizes Wright's result on the plane partition generating
function. In order to obtain these transformations, several new intermediate

properties of a localized tweezer are varied. The system is modeled by the
Lugiato-Lefever equation, a variant of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. We
produced an effective, localized, trapping tweezer potential by assuming a
Gaussian phase-modulation of the holding beam. The potential for tweezing is
then assessed as the width, the total (temporal) displacement and speed of the
tweezer are varied and corresponding phase diagrams are presented. As the
relative speed of the tweezer is increased we find four possible dynamical

These modes probe the dynamics and structure of the solar convection zone down
to the tachocline. While linear analysis allows the complex eigenfrequencies
and eigenfunctions of these modes to be computed, it gives no information about
their excitation nor about their amplitudes.
  We tested the hypothesis that solar inertial modes are stochastically excited
by the turbulent motions entailed by convection. We have developed a
theoretical formalism where the turbulent velocity fluctuations provide the
mechanical work necessary to excite the modes. The modes are described by means
of a 2D linear wave equation, relevant for the quasi-toroidal modes observed on
the Sun, with a source term, under the beta plane approximation. Latitudinal
differential rotation is included in the form of a parabolic profile that
approximates the solar differential rotation at low and mid latitudes.
  We obtain synthetic power spectra for the wave's latitudinal velocity,
longitudinal velocity, and radial vorticity, with azimuthal orders between 1
and 20. The synthetic power spectra contain the classical equatorial Rossby
modes, as well as a rich spectrum of additional modes. The mode amplitudes are
found to be of the same order of magnitude as observed on the Sun (~ 1 m/s).
There is a qualitative transition between low and high azimuthal orders: the
power spectra for m < 5 show modes that are clearly resolved in frequency
space, while the power spectra for m > 5 display regions of excess power that
consist of many overlapping modes.
  The general agreement between the predicted and observed inertial mode
amplitudes supports the assumption of stochastic excitation by turbulent
convection. Our work shows that the power spectra are not easily separable into
individual modes, thus complicated the interpretation of the observations.

clinical trials that study and establish new interventions face several
challenges, such as high cost and time commitment. Observational studies that
use existing clinical data to observe the effect of an intervention have shown
several advantages over RCTs. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become an
increasingly important resource for conducting observational studies. To
support these studies, we developed a clinical research datamart, called
ReDWINE (Rehabilitation Datamart With Informatics iNfrastructure for rEsearch),
that transforms the rehabilitation-related EHR data collected from the UPMC
health care system to the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics
(OHDSI) Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model
(CDM) to facilitate rehabilitation research. The standardized EHR data stored
in ReDWINE will further reduce the time and effort required by investigators to
pool, harmonize, clean, and analyze data from multiple sources, leading to more
robust and comprehensive research findings. ReDWINE also includes deployment of
data visualization and data analytics tools to facilitate cohort definition and
clinical data analysis. These include among others the Open Health Natural
Language Processing (OHNLP) toolkit, a high-throughput NLP pipeline, to provide
text analytical capabilities at scale in ReDWINE. Using this comprehensive
representation of patient data in ReDWINE for rehabilitation research will
facilitate real-world evidence for health interventions and outcomes.

that have led to a growing interest in their analysis. In particular, a
characteristic that some property crimes frequently present is the existence of
uncertainty about their exact location in time, being usual to only have a time
window that delimits the occurrence of the event. There are different methods
to deal with this type of interval-censored observation, most of them based on
event time imputation. Another alternative is to carry out an aoristic
analysis, which is based on assigning the same weight to each time unit
included in the interval that limits the uncertainty about the event. However,
this method has its limitations. In this paper, we present a spatio-temporal
model based on the logistic regression that allows the analysis of crime data
with temporal uncertainty, following the spirit of the aoristic method. The
model is developed from a Bayesian perspective, which allows accommodating the
temporal uncertainty of the observations. The model is applied to a dataset of

density function for the difficult to measure quantity or field will not be
appropriately clustered around the truth. In particular, the inverse problem
should be formulated by evaluating the numerical solution at the true point
locations for direct comparison with the point data source. If the data are
first fitted to a gridded or meshed field on the computational grid or mesh,
and the inverse problem formulated by comparing the numerical solution to the
fitted field, the benefits of additional point data values below the grid
density will be lost. We demonstrate, with examples in the fields of
groundwater hydrology and glaciology, that a consistent formulation can
increase the accuracy of results and aid discourse between modellers and
observationalists.
  To do this, we bring point data into the finite element method ecosystem as
discontinuous fields on meshes of disconnected vertices. Point evaluation can
then be formulated as a finite element interpolation operation
(dual-evaluation). This new abstraction is well-suited to automation, including
automatic differentiation. We demonstrate this through implementation in
Firedrake, which generates highly optimised code for solving Partial

analysis. Then, the correlates of draw resistance are used as inputs for the
machine learning model, and the predicted values of draw resistance are used as
outputs. Finally, this research also innovatively verifies the practical
application value of draw resistance prediction: the distribution
characteristics of substandard cigarettes are analyzed based on the prediction
results, the time interval of substandard cigarettes being produced is
determined, the probability model of substandard cigarettes being sampled is
derived, and the reliability of the prediction result is further verified by
the example. The results show that the prediction model based on correlation

from galactic binaries (GBs) of white dwarfs or neutron stars. Some of these
objects are among the most magnetic astrophysical objects in the Universe.
Magnetism, by secularly disrupting the orbit, can eventually affect the
gravitational waves emission and could then be potentially detected and
characterized after several years of observations by LISA. Currently, the data
processing pipeline of the LISA Data Challenge (LDC) for GBs does not consider
either magnetism or eccentricity. Recently, it was shown [Bourgoin et al. PRD
105, 124042 (2022)] that magnetism induces a shift on the gravitational wave
frequencies. Additionally, it was argued that, if the binary's orbit is
eccentric, the presence of magnetism could be detected by LISA. In this work,
we explore the consequences of a future data analysis conducted on
quasi-circular and magnetic GB systems using the current LDC tools. We first
show that a single eccentric GB can be interpreted as several GBs and this can
eventually bias population studies deduced from LISA's future catalog. Then, we
confirm that for quasi-circular orbits, the secular magnetic energy of the
system can be inferred if the signal-to-noise ratio of the second harmonic is
high enough to be detected by traditional quasi-monochromatic source searching
algorithms. LISA observations could therefore bring new insights on the nature

instead contribute on the same footing as poles to determine the topological
character of an insulator. The key to the proof, worked out explicitly in 2D

of a \textit{quasiparticle} thermal Green's function matrix
$G_*(i\epsilon,\mathbf{k})= 1/\big(i\epsilon-H_*(\epsilon,\mathbf{k})\big)$,
with hermitian $H_*(\epsilon,\mathbf{k})$, by filtering out the positive
definite \textit{quasiparticle} residue. In that way, the topological invariant
is easily found to reduce to the TKNN formula for quasiparticles described by
the non-interacting Hamiltonian $H_*(0,\mathbf{k})$. Since the poles of the
quasiparticle Green's function $G_*(\epsilon,\mathbf{k})$ on the real frequency
axis correspond to poles and zeros of the physical-particle Green's function
$G(\epsilon,\mathbf{k})$, both of them equally determine the topological
character of an insulator.

V1504 Cyg during the decline from an outburst. Our goal is to search for
evidence for an evaporated X-ray corona. Such a corona can be understood as an
optically thin geometrically thick disc around a central part of an optically
thick geometrically thin disc. METHODS: We study the X-ray spectra using a
cooling flow model and the evolution of the amplitude of variability and power
density spectra in UV and X-rays. RESULTS: The X-ray (pn) count rate increases
from initially around 0.03 cps to 0.17 cps with a harder spectrum and a higher
degree of variability. Meanwhile, the OM/UVW1 light curve follows a slow
decline with decreasing amplitude of variability. For further study we split
the X-ray data into two parts, and analysed them separately. Both parts are
described by a cooling flow model, while the first low luminosity part requires
an additional power law component suggesting presence of a wind. Spectral
fitting revealed a higher temperature during the second brighter part. Timing
analysis reveals a potential break frequency at log(f/Hz) = -3.02 during
decline towards the quiescence. This detection agrees with optical data from
Kepler observations. CONCLUSIONS: The X-ray nature of the break frequency
supports the innermost parts of the disc as source of the variability.
Moreover, a similar frequency was observed in several other cataclysmic
variables and a sandwich model where a geometrically thick corona surrounds the
geometrically thin disc is a possible accretion configuration.

of anomalous time series. Consider the problem of computing correlations for
highly correlated pairs of time series across sliding windows. Efficiently
computing and updating the correlation matrix for user-defined sliding periods
and thresholds enables large-scale time series network dynamics analysis. We
introduce Dangoron, a framework for effectively identifying highly correlated
pairs of time series over sliding windows and computing their exact
correlation. By predicting dynamic correlation across sliding windows and
pruning unrelated time series, Dangoron is at least an order of magnitude
faster than a baseline. Additionally, we propose Tomborg, the first benchmark
for the problem of correlation matrix computation.

  Intelligence",,,,,"cs.CY cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the world as we know it,
implying that it is up to the current generation to use the technology for
''good.'' We argue that making good use of AI constitutes aligning it with the
wellbeing of conscious creatures. However, designing wellbeing-aligned AI
systems is difficult. In this article, we investigate a total of twelve
challenges that can be categorized as related to a lack of knowledge (how to
contextualize, operationalize, optimize, and design AI for wellbeing), and lack
of motivation (designing AI for wellbeing is seen as risky and unrewarding).
Our discussion can be summarized into three key takeaways: 1) our understanding
of the impact of systems on wellbeing should be advanced, 2) systems should be
designed to promote and sustain wellbeing intentionally, and 3), above all,
Positive AI starts with believing that we can change the world for the better
and that it is profitable.

two candidate systems of brain regions which may support this -- the Multiple

and the Language system (LS), known to primarily respond to language stimuli.
We devise experiment conditions to isolate the act of code comprehension, and
employ a state-of-the-art method to locate brain systems of interest. We
administer these experiments in Python (24 participants) and Scratch Jr. (19
participants) - which provides a visual interface to programming, thus
eliminating the effect of text in code comprehension. From this robust
experiment setup, we find that the Language system is not consistently involved
in code comprehension, while the MD is. Further, we find no other brain regions
beyond those in the MD to be responsive to code. We also find that variable
names, the control flow used in the program, and the types of operations
performed do not affect brain responses. We discuss the implications of our
findings on the software engineering and CS education communities.

functionalities is a long-standing challenge in chemistry, material science,
and drug discovery. Recently, machine learning-based generative models have
emerged as promising approaches for \emph{de novo} molecule design. However,
further refinement of methodology is highly desired as most existing methods
lack unified modeling of 2D topology and 3D geometry information and fail to
effectively learn the structure-property relationship for molecule design. Here
we present MolCode, a roto-translation equivariant generative framework for
\underline{Mol}ecular graph-structure \underline{Co-de}sign. In MolCode, 3D
geometric information empowers the molecular 2D graph generation, which in turn
helps guide the prediction of molecular 3D structure. Extensive experimental
results show that MolCode outperforms previous methods on a series of
challenging tasks including \emph{de novo} molecule design, targeted molecule
discovery, and structure-based drug design. Particularly, MolCode not only
consistently generates valid (99.95$\%$ Validity) and diverse (98.75$\%$
Uniqueness) molecular graphs/structures with desirable properties, but also
generate drug-like molecules with high affinity to target proteins (61.8$\%$
high-affinity ratio), which demonstrates MolCode's potential applications in
material design and drug discovery. Our extensive investigation reveals that
the 2D topology and 3D geometry contain intrinsically complementary information
in molecule design, and provide new insights into machine learning-based
molecule representation and generation.

  the treatment of parametric dependencies in nonlinear systems",,,,,"math.NA cs.CE cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reduced Order Models (ROMs) are of considerable importance in many areas of
engineering in which computational time presents difficulties. Established
approaches employ projection-based reduction such as Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition, however, such methods can become inefficient or fail in the case
of parameteric or strongly nonlinear models. Such limitations are usually
tackled via a library of local reduction bases each of which being valid for a
given parameter vector. The success of such methods, however, is strongly
reliant upon the method used to relate the parameter vectors to the local
bases, this is typically achieved using clustering or interpolation methods. We
propose the replacement of these methods with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
to be used as a generative model which can infer the local basis corresponding
to a given parameter vector in a probabilistic manner. The resulting
VAE-boosted parametric ROM \emph{VpROM} still retains the physical insights of
a projection-based method but also allows for better treatment of problems
where model dependencies or excitation traits cause the dynamic behavior to
span multiple response regimes. Moreover, the probabilistic treatment of the
VAE representation allows for uncertainty quantification on the reduction bases
which may then be propagated to the ROM response. The performance of the
proposed approach is validated on an open-source simulation benchmark featuring
hysteresis and multi-parametric dependencies, and on a large-scale wind turbine
tower characterised by nonlinear material behavior and model uncertainty.

When a neural field should jointly model multiple signals, and not memorize
only one, it needs to be conditioned on a latent code which describes the
signal at hand. Despite being an important aspect, there has been little
research on conditioning strategies for neural fields. In this work, we explore
the use of neural fields as decoders for 2D semantic segmentation. For this
task, we compare three conditioning methods, simple concatenation of the latent
code, Feature Wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), and Cross-Attention, in
conjunction with latent codes which either describe the full image or only a
local region of the image. Our results show a considerable difference in
performance between the examined conditioning strategies. Furthermore, we show
that conditioning via Cross-Attention achieves the best results and is
competitive with a CNN-based decoder for semantic segmentation.

path to optimize material structures for desired properties. This requires
understanding the interplay between the processing-(micro)structure-property
linkages using a multi-scale approach that connects the macro-scale (process
parameters) to meso (homogenized properties) and micro (crystallographic
texture) scales. Due to the nature of the problem's multi-scale modeling setup,
possible processing path choices could grow exponentially as the decision tree
becomes deeper, and the traditional simulators' speed reaches a critical
computational threshold. To lessen the computational burden for predicting
microstructural evolution under given loading conditions, we develop a neural
network (NN)-based method with physics-infused constraints. The NN aims to
learn the evolution of microstructures under each elementary process. Our
method is effective and robust in finding optimal processing paths. In this
study, our NN-based method is applied to maximize the homogenized stiffness of
a Copper microstructure, and it is found to be 686 times faster while achieving
0.053% error in the resulting homogenized stiffness compared to the traditional
finite element simulator on a 10-process experiment.

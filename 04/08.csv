environment to meet strict performance indicators. Reconfigurable Intelligent
Surface (RIS) technology is gaining attention for its advantages of low power
consumption, cost-effectiveness, and ease of deployment. However, existing
channel models for RIS often ignore important properties, such as the
impairment in the RIS's switch component and the polarization efficiency among
antennas, limiting their practical use. In this paper, we propose a new channel
model for RIS that considers these ignored properties, including the reflected
field, scattered field, and antenna resonant mode. We verify the proposed model
through the practical implementation of a 4 x 4 RIS array with patch antennas
in the 3.5 GHz band, using a phase shifter as the switch component of a RIS
element. The equivalent model of the phase shifter is also formulated and
incorporated into the channel model. We propose a blind controlling algorithm
to discuss the properties of our channel model and emphasize the importance of
considering polarization and tracking mechanisms for the controlling algorithm.
Our channel model is an improvement over existing models and can be used in the
practical design of RIS technology. The proposed algorithm provides a practical
approach to controlling the wireless environment, suitable for various wireless
applications.

subtle concurrency semantics of C/C++.One of the most fundamental problems
associated with a memory model M is consistency checking: given an execution X,
is X consistent with M? This problem lies at the heart of numerous
applications, including specification testing and litmus tests, stateless model
checking, and dynamic analyses. As such, it has been explored extensively and
its complexity is well-understood for traditional models like SC and TSO.
However, less is known for the numerous model variants of C/C++, for which the
problem becomes challenging due to the intricacies of their concurrency
primitives. In this work we study the problem of consistency checking for
popular variants of the C11 memory model, in particular, the RC20 model, its
release-acquire (RA) fragment, the strong and weak variants of RA (SRA and
WRA), as well as the Relaxed fragment of RC20. Motivated by applications in
testing and model checking, we focus on reads-from consistency checking. The
input is an execution X specifying a set of events, their program order and
their reads-from relation, and the task is to decide the existence of a
modification order on the writes of X that makes X consistent in a memory
model. We draw a rich complexity landscape for this problem; our results
include (i)~nearly-linear-time algorithms for certain variants, which improve
over prior results, (ii)~fine-grained optimality results, as well as
(iii)~matching upper and lower bounds (NP-hardness) for other variants. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to characterize the complexity of consistency
checking for C11 memory models. We have implemented our algorithms inside the
TruSt model checker and the C11Tester testing tool. Experiments on standard
benchmarks show that our new algorithms improve consistency checking, often by
a significant margin.

a `hard' power-law tail $\propto \varepsilon^{-2}$, where $\varepsilon$ is the
particle energy. The shape of the `core' of the distribution, located at low

momenta in an arbitrary covariant gauge and space-time dimension. There exist
numerous efforts in literature where one-loop off-shell vertex is calculated by
employing the standard first order Feynman rules in different covariant gauges
and space-time dimensions of interest. The tensor structure which decomposes
this three-point vertex into the components transverse and longitudinal to the
photon momentum gets intertwined in this first order formalism. The
Ward-Takahashi identity is explicitly invoked to untangle the two pieces and
the results are expressed in a preferred basis of twelve spin-amplitudes. We
propose a novel approach based upon an efficient combination of the first and
second order formalisms of quantum electrodynamics to compute this one-loop
vertex. Among some conspicuous advantages is the fact that this less known
second order formalism separates the spin and scalar degrees of freedom of an
electron interacting electromagnetically. More noticeably, the longitudinal and
transverse contributions naturally disentangle from the onset in our approach.
Moreover, this decomposition leads to identities between one-loop scalar
Feynman integrals with higher powers in the propagators and shifted space-time
dimensions that can be used to prove the Ward-Takahashi identity at one-loop
order without the need to evaluate any Feynman integral. Additionally, this
natural decomposition allows us to establish the gauge-independence of the
Pauli form factor through explicit cancellations of scalar Feynman integrals
that depend on the gauge parameter. These cancellations naturally lead to a
compact expression for the Pauli form factor in arbitrary dimensions. Wherever
necessary and insightful, we make comparisons with earlier works.

how to achieve higher-order control-adapted spectral estimation for

operating parameter regime, control that is optimized based on non-Gaussian
noise spectroscopy can substantially outperform standard Walsh decoupling
sequences as well as sequences that are optimized based solely on Gaussian
noise spectroscopy. This approach is also intrinsically more resource-efficient
than frequency-domain comb-based methods.

developers in research and industry. In ML applications, unfairness is
triggered due to bias in the data, curation process, erroneous assumptions, and

applications come into broader use developing fair ML applications is critical.
Literature suggests multiple views on how fairness in ML is described from the
users perspective and students as future developers. In particular, ML
developers have not been the focus of research relating to perceived fairness.
This paper reports on a pilot investigation of ML developers perception of
fairness. In describing the perception of fairness, the paper performs an
exploratory pilot study to assess the attributes of this construct using a
systematic focus group of developers. In the focus group, we asked participants
to discuss three questions- 1) What are the characteristics of fairness in ML?
2) What factors influence developers belief about the fairness of ML? and 3)
What practices and tools are utilized for fairness in ML development? The
findings of this exploratory work from the focus group show that to assess
fairness developers generally focus on the overall ML application design and
development, i.e., business-specific requirements, data collection,
pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. Thus, we conclude that the
procedural aspects of organizational justice theory can explain developers
perception of fairness. The findings of this study can be utilized further to
assist development teams in integrating fairness in the ML application
development lifecycle. It will also motivate ML developers and organizations to
develop best practices for assessing the fairness of ML-based applications.

of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation scales with cosmological
redshift $z$ as $T_{\rm CMB}(z) \propto (1+z)$ at all times after recombination
at $z_\star \simeq 1090$. However, this assumption has only been precisely
tested at $z \lesssim 3$. Here, we consider cosmological models with
post-recombination reheating (PRR), in which the CMB monopole temperature
abruptly increases due to energy injection after last scattering. Such a
scenario can potentially resolve tensions between inferences of the current
cosmic expansion rate (the Hubble constant, $H_0$). We consider an explicit
model in which a metastable sub-component of dark matter (DM) decays to
Standard Model photons, whose spectral energy distribution is assumed to be
close to that of the CMB blackbody. A fit to Planck CMB anisotropy, COBE/FIRAS
CMB monopole, and SH0ES distance-ladder measurements yields $H_0 = 71.2 \pm
1.1$ km/s/Mpc, matter fluctuation amplitude $S_8 = 0.774 \pm 0.018$, and CMB
temperature increase $\delta T_{\rm CMB} = 0.109^{+0.033}_{-0.044}$ K, which is
sourced by DM decay at $z \gtrsim 10$. However, matter density constraints from
baryon acoustic oscillation and supernovae data highly constrain this scenario,
with a joint fit to all datasets yielding $H_0 = 68.69 \pm 0.35$ km/s/Mpc, $S_8
= 0.8035 \pm 0.0081$, and $\delta T_{\rm CMB} < 0.0342$ K (95% CL upper limit).
These bounds can be weakened if additional dark relativistic species are
present in the early universe, yielding higher $H_0$. We conclude that current
data disfavor models with significant PRR solely through its impact on
background and linear-theory observables, completely independent of CMB
spectral distortion constraints. However, a small amount of such energy
injection could play a role in restoring cosmological concordance.

  In this work, we use a combination of static and dynamic techniques to

dynamic techniques change thread priorities at runtime to eliminate priority

research findings. Impagliazzo, Lei, Pitassi and Sorrell (`22) recently
initiated the study of replicability in machine learning. A learning algorithm
is replicable if it typically produces the same output when applied on two
i.i.d. inputs using the same internal randomness. We study a variant of
replicability that does not involve fixing the randomness. An algorithm
satisfies this form of replicability if it typically produces the same output
when applied on two i.i.d. inputs (without fixing the internal randomness).
This variant is called global stability and was introduced by Bun, Livni and
Moran ('20) in the context of differential privacy.
  Impagliazzo et al. showed how to boost any replicable algorithm so that it
produces the same output with probability arbitrarily close to 1. In contrast,
we demonstrate that for numerous learning tasks, global stability can only be
accomplished weakly, where the same output is produced only with probability
bounded away from 1. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of
list replicability, which is equivalent to global stability. Moreover, we prove
that list replicability can be boosted so that it is achieved with probability

learning-theoretic complexity measures and list replicable numbers. Our

The periodic nature of breath signal energy is used to segment the breath

(ECL) in an interactive 3D environment. Specifically, a robot agent can ground
visual concepts, build semantic maps and plan actions to complete tasks by
learning purely from human demonstrations and language instructions, without
access to ground-truth semantic and depth supervisions from simulations. ECL
consists of: (i) an instruction parser that translates the natural languages

concepts based on language descriptions; (iii) a map constructor that estimates
depth and constructs semantic maps by leveraging the learned concepts; and (iv)
a program executor with deterministic policies to execute each program. ECL has
several appealing benefits thanks to its modularized design. Firstly, it
enables the robotic agent to learn semantics and depth unsupervisedly acting
like babies, e.g., ground concepts through active interaction and perceive
depth by disparities when moving forward. Secondly, ECL is fully transparent
and step-by-step interpretable in long-term planning. Thirdly, ECL could be
beneficial for the embodied instruction following (EIF), outperforming previous

the learned concept can be reused for other downstream tasks, such as reasoning

challenge this dense paradigm and present a new method, coined SparseFormer, to
imitate human's sparse visual recognition in an end-to-end manner. SparseFormer
learns to represent images using a highly limited number of tokens (down to 49)

processing dense units in the original pixel space. Therefore, SparseFormer
circumvents most of dense operations on the image space and has much lower

well-established models while offering better accuracy-throughput tradeoff.

(i.e. with $H/R\gtrsim 0.1$) discs. However, a clear consensus is still missing
mainly owing to numerical limitations, such as fixed orbit binaries or lack of
resolution inside the cavity carved by the binary in its circumbinary disc. In
this work, we asses the importance of evolving the binary orbit by means of
hydrodynamic simulations performed with the code {\sc gizmo} in
meshless-finite-mass mode. In order to model the interaction between equal mass
circular binaries and their locally isothermal circumbinary discs, we enforce
hyper-Lagrangian resolution inside the cavity. We find that fixing the binary
orbit ultimately leads to an overestimate of the gravitational torque that the
gas exerts on the binary, and in an underestimate of the torque due to the
accretion of material onto the binary components. Furthermore, we find that the
modulation of the accretion rate on the binary orbital period is strongly
suppressed in the fixed orbit simulation, while it is clearly present in the
live binary simulations. This has potential implications for the prediction of
the observable periodicities in massive black hole binary candidates.

probe of the inner regions of lens galaxies. The presence of an offset central
supermassive black hole (SMBH) has the potential to distort the time-delay
surface in a way such that 3 central images form: a strongly de-magnified image
near the SMBH, and two less de-magnified (and potentially observable) images at
a central maximum and saddle point. Using a quad lens macro model, we simulate
the constraints that could be placed on various lens galaxy parameters based on
their central images probability of detection or non-detection. Informed by a
recent low-redshift distribution of off-nucleus AGN, we utilize Bayesian
inference to constrain the mean SMBH off-nucleus distance and galactic core
radius for a sample of 6 quads. In general, we find that a detection of the
central image in any quad would favor larger SMBH off-nucleus distances and
galaxy core sizes. Assuming a linear relationship between core radii and
velocity dispersion $r_c = b\sigma$, these results similarly imply strong
constraints on $b$, where the likely case of a central image non-detection in
each quad constraining $b$ to $3.11^{+2.72}_{-2.26} \times 10^{-4}$ kpc

can be made regardless of a detection or non-detection of a central image.
Therefore, we recommend observational searches for the central image, possibly

stronger constraints on lens galaxy parameters.

as resource states and standard Bell measurements of photons for fusing them
into a large spin-qubit cluster state. The scheme is tailored to emitters with
limited memory capabilities since it only uses an initial non-adaptive
(ballistic) fusion process to construct a fully percolated graph state of
multiple emitters. By exploring various geometrical constructions for fusing
entangled photons from deterministic emitters, we improve the photon loss
tolerance significantly compared to similar all-photonic schemes.

evolution of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in the zone 0.1 $\leq
\mathrm{R}/\mathrm{R}_\mathrm{500} \leq$ 1 around massive central galaxies in
group-scale halos. We find that the CGM is both multiphase and highly dynamic.
Investigating the dynamics, we identify seven patterns of evolution. We show
that these are robust and detected consistently across various conditions.
There are two pathways by which the gas cools: (1) filamentary cooling inflows
and (2) condensations forming from rapidly cooling density perturbations. In
our cosmological simulations, the perturbations are mainly seeded by orbiting
substructures. We find that condensations can form even when the median
$t_\mathrm{cool} / t_\mathrm{ff}$ of the X-ray emitting gas is above the
canonical threshold of 10 or 20. Strong amplitude perturbations can provoke
runaway cooling regardless of the state of the background gas. We also find
perturbations whose local $t_\mathrm{cool} / t_\mathrm{ff}$ ratios drop below
the threshold but which do not condense. Rather, the ratios fall to some
minimum value and then bounce. These are weak perturbations that are
temporarily swept up in satellite wakes and carried to larger radii. Their
$t_\mathrm{cool} / t_\mathrm{ff}$ ratios decrease because the denominator
($t_\mathrm{ff}$) is increasing, not because the numerator ($t_\mathrm{cool}$)
is decreasing. For structures forming hierarchically, our study highlights the
challenge of using a simple threshold argument to infer the CGM's evolution. It
also highlights that the median hot gas properties are suboptimal determinants
of the CGM's state and dynamics. Realistic CGM models must factor in the
effects and after-effects of mergers and orbiting satellites, along with the
CGM's heating and cooling cycles.

only be elicited from expert critics. However, in most practical applications,
several non-expert stakeholders also play a major role in the system and can
have distinctive opinions about the decision making philosophy. For example, in
kidney placement programs, transplant surgeons are very wary about accepting
kidney offers for black patients due to genetic reasons. However, non-expert
stakeholders in kidney placement programs (e.g. patients, donors and their
family members) may misinterpret such decisions from the perspective of social
discrimination. This paper evaluates group fairness notions from the viewpoint
of non-expert stakeholders, who can only provide binary
\emph{agreement/disagreement feedback} regarding the decision in context.
Specifically, two types of group fairness notions have been identified: (i)
\emph{definite notions} (e.g. calibration), which can be evaluated exactly
using disagreement feedback, and (ii) \emph{indefinite notions} (e.g. equal
opportunity) which suffer from uncertainty due to lack of label feedback. In
the case of indefinite notions, bounds are presented based on disagreement
rates, and an estimate is constructed based on established bounds. The efficacy
of all our findings are validated empirically on real human feedback dataset.

non-trivial time dependence. In the present work we treat the Time Crystal-like

study cosmic evolution on this ``dynamic'' ground state. In the first part we
re-derive \cite{Chakraborty:2020ktp}, in a covariant and more systematic way,
the frequencies that characterize the oscillator like Time crystalline
condensate and interpret it as a background energy-momentum tensor simulating a
matter-like effect. Importantly, no external matter is introduced here and the
condensate, consists of a combination of the metric field $g_{\mu\nu}$ and is
generated due to the $R^2$-term ($R$ is the Ricci scalar) in quadratic gravity

find that the Time Crystal Condensate contributes as a new matter candidate

the spatial geometry of the universe, the Time Crystal condensate generates a
decelerating phase before the early acceleration starts. This is an indication
of a contracting phase of the universe before its accelerated expansion.

framework for correcting likelihood misspecifications in several paradigm
agnostic noisy prior models and test the model's ability to remove the
misspecification. The ""ABC-GAN"" framework introduced is a novel generative
modeling paradigm, which combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). This new paradigm assists the existing
GANs by incorporating any subjective knowledge available about the modeling
process via ABC, as a regularizer, resulting in a partially interpretable model
that operates well under low data regimes. At the same time, unlike any
Bayesian analysis, the explicit knowledge need not be perfect, since the
generator in the GAN can be made arbitrarily complex. ABC-GAN eliminates the
need for summary statistics and distance metrics as the discriminator
implicitly learns them and enables simultaneous specification of multiple
generative models. The model misspecification is simulated in our experiments
by introducing noise of various biases and variances. The correction term is
learnt via the ABC-GAN, with skip connections, referred to as skipGAN. The
strength of the skip connection indicates the amount of correction needed or
how misspecified the prior model is. Based on a simple experimental setup, we
show that the ABC-GAN models not only correct the misspecification of the
prior, but also perform as well as or better than the respective priors under
noisier conditions. In this proposal, we show that ABC-GANs get the best of
both worlds.

a class of bounded-degree expanders, based on zig-zag products of graphs. We
expect this to be of independent interest.
  We then use our class of FO definable bounded-degree expanders to answer a
long-standing open problem for proximity-oblivious testers (POTs). POTs are a
class of particularly simple testing algorithms, where a basic test is
performed a number of times that may depend on the proximity parameter, but the
basic test itself is independent of the proximity parameter. In their seminal

subgraph freeness (GSF) property that satisfies the non-propagation condition.
It is left open whether the non-propagation condition is necessary. We give a
negative answer by showing that our property is a GSF property which is

accommodate up to $15\%$ Pt vacancies ($x=0.85$), which act as acceptors as
measured by Hall effect. Two classes of electrical transport behavior are
observed. Pt-deficient films display a metallic temperature dependent
resistivity (d$\rho$/dT$>$0). The longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR, magnetic
field $\mathbf{B}$ parallel to electric field $\mathbf{E}$) is more negative
than transverse magnetoresistance (TMR, $\mathbf{B} \perp \mathbf{E}$),
consistent with the expected chiral anomaly for a Weyl semimetal. The
combination of Pt-vacancy disorder and doping away from the expected Weyl
nodes; however, suggests conductivity fluctuations may explain the negative LMR
rather than chiral anomaly. Samples closer to stoichiometry display the
opposite behavior: semiconductor-like resistivity (d$\rho$/dT$<$0) and more
negative transverse magnetoresistance than longitudinal magnetoresistance.
Hysteresis and other nonlinearities in the low field Hall effect and
magnetoresistance suggest that spin disorder scattering, and possible
topological Hall effect, may dominate the near stoichiometric samples. Our
findings highlight the complications of transport-based identification of Weyl

forming a control policy through batch learning in a linear-quadratic (LQ)
system. In this scenario, an attacker aims to trick the learner into
implementing a targeted malicious policy by manipulating the batch data before
the agent begins its learning process. An attack model is crafted to carry out
the poisoning strategically, with the goal of modifying the batch data as
little as possible to avoid detection by the learner. We establish an
optimization framework to guide the design of such policy poisoning attacks.
The presence of bi-linear constraints in the optimization problem requires the
design of a computationally efficient algorithm to obtain a solution.
Therefore, we develop an iterative scheme based on the Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) which is able to return solutions that are
approximately optimal. Several case studies are used to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the algorithm in carrying out the sensor-based attack on the
batch-learning agent in LQ control systems.

potential to generate code from natural language descriptions across a wide

evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate functionally correct code from natural
language intent with respect to a set of hidden test cases. This has enabled
the research community to identify significant and reproducible advancements in
LLM capabilities. However, there is currently a lack of benchmark datasets for
assessing the ability of LLMs to generate functionally correct code edits based
on natural language descriptions of intended changes. This paper aims to
address this gap by motivating the problem NL2Fix of translating natural
language descriptions of code changes (namely bug fixes described in Issue
reports in repositories) into correct code fixes. To this end, we introduce
Defects4J-NL2Fix, a dataset of 283 Java programs from the popular Defects4J
dataset augmented with high-level descriptions of bug fixes, and empirically
evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs for the this task.
Results show that these LLMS together are capable of generating plausible fixes
for 64.6% of the bugs, and the best LLM-based technique can achieve up to
21.20% top-1 and 35.68% top-5 accuracy on this benchmark.

by Gaussian process (GP) modeling is presented here. This approach allows the
creation of a scheme of arbitrary order with simply defined multidimensional

introduced, as well as an easy-to-implement effective limiter for positivity

to-be-adopted temporal resolution is crucial in constructing and analyzing the

with temporally sparse graphs. In such cases, changing the temporal resolution
by grouping events (i.e., edges) from consecutive timestamps, a technique known
as timeslicing, can aid in the analysis and reveal patterns that might not be

trivial. In this paper, we propose TDANetVis, a methodology that suggests
temporal resolutions potentially relevant for analyzing a given graph, i.e.,

Specifically, QC measurement implements the process of variate sampling

mapping from model state variables to analysis increments, in order to showcase
the feasibility of a data-driven model parameterization which can predict
state-dependent model errors. We undertake this problem using an ice-ocean data
assimilation system within the Seamless system for Prediction and EArth system
Research (SPEAR) model, developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory,
which assimilates satellite observations of sea ice concentration every 5 days
between 1982--2017. The CNN then takes inputs of data assimilation forecast
states and tendencies, and makes predictions of the corresponding sea ice
concentration increments. Specifically, the inputs are states and tendencies of
sea ice concentration, sea-surface temperature, ice velocities, ice thickness,
net shortwave radiation, ice-surface skin temperature, sea-surface salinity, as
well as a land-sea mask. We find the CNN is able to make skillful predictions
of the increments in both the Arctic and Antarctic and across all seasons, with
skill that consistently exceeds that of a climatological increment prediction.
This suggests that the CNN could be used to reduce sea ice biases in
free-running SPEAR simulations, either as a sea ice parameterization or an

accelerate the development of end-to-end motion forecasting models, we augment
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with large-scale, high-quality, diverse
LiDAR data for the motion forecasting task.
  The new augmented dataset WOMD-LiDAR consists of over 100,000 scenes that
each spans 20 seconds, consisting of well-synchronized and calibrated high
quality LiDAR point clouds captured across a range of urban and suburban
geographies (https://waymo.com/open/data/motion/). Compared to Waymo Open

integrate the LiDAR data into the motion forecasting model training and provide

concerns about such models learning shortcuts, and their lack of robustness to
irrelevant confounders. When it comes to models directly trained on human
faces, a sensitive confounder is that of human identities. Many face-related
tasks should ideally be identity-independent, and perform uniformly across
different individuals (i.e. be fair). One way to measure and enforce such
robustness and performance uniformity is through enforcing it during training,
assuming identity-related information is available at scale. However, due to
privacy concerns and also the cost of collecting such information, this is
often not the case, and most face datasets simply contain input images and
their corresponding task-related labels. Thus, improving identity-related
robustness without the need for such annotations is of great importance. Here,
we explore using face-recognition embedding vectors, as proxies for identities,
to enforce such robustness. We propose to use the structure in the
face-recognition embedding space, to implicitly emphasize rare samples within
each class. We do so by weighting samples according to their conditional
inverse density (CID) in the proxy embedding space. Our experiments suggest
that such a simple sample weighting scheme, not only improves the training
robustness, it often improves the overall performance as a result of such
robustness. We also show that employing such constraints during training
results in models that are significantly less sensitive to different levels of
bias in the dataset.

Comparing synthetic absorption spectra with observations, we constrained the

prevents us from constraining its temperature and mass-loss rate significantly;
we obtained ranges of 6000-17 000\,K and 23.5$\pm$21.5$\times$10$^{11}$

(ML) models on distributed data while preserving user's data privacy. This is
done by distributing the model to clients to perform training on their local
data and computing the final model at a central server. To prevent any data
leakage from the local model updates, various works with focus on secure
aggregation for privacy preserving federated learning have been proposed.
Despite their merits, most of the existing protocols still incur high
communication and computation overhead on the participating entities and might
not be optimized to efficiently handle the large update vectors for ML models.
In this paper, we present E-seaML, a novel secure aggregation protocol with
high communication and computation efficiency. E-seaML only requires one round
of communication in the aggregation phase and it is up to 318x and 1224x faster
for the user and the server (respectively) as compared to its most efficient
counterpart. E-seaML also allows for efficiently verifying the integrity of the
final model by allowing the aggregation server to generate a proof of honest
aggregation for the participating users. This high efficiency and versatility
is achieved by extending (and weakening) the assumption of the existing works
on the set of honest parties (i.e., users) to a set of assisting nodes.
Therefore, we assume a set of assisting nodes which assist the aggregation
server in the aggregation process. We also discuss, given the minimal
computation and communication overhead on the assisting nodes, how one could
assume a set of rotating users to as assisting nodes in each iteration. We
provide the open-sourced implementation of E-seaML for public verifiability and
testing.

a series of purely mental steps, we can make inferences we would not be capable

steps (a chain of thought) before answering a question, they often produce
better answers than they otherwise would. We investigate why and how
chain-of-thought reasoning is useful in language models, testing the hypothesis
that reasoning is effective when training data consists of local clusters of
variables that influence each other strongly. These training conditions enable
the chaining of accurate local inferences in order to estimate relationships
between variables that were not seen together in training. We prove that there
will exist a ""reasoning gap"", where reasoning through intermediate variables
improves inference, for the simple case of an autoregressive density estimator
trained on local samples from a chain-structured probabilistic model. We then
test our hypothesis empirically in more complex models, training an
autoregressive language model on samples from Bayes nets but only including a
subset of variables in each sample. We test language models' ability to match
conditional probabilities with and without intermediate reasoning steps,
finding that intermediate steps are only helpful when the training data is
locally structured with respect to dependencies between variables and that the
combination of locally-structured observations and reasoning is much more

algebra. These states are needed for calculating parton distribution functions
and other types of distribution amplitudes that are used to understand the

strongly interacting states can be computed in any frame. This is useful for
computing current matrix elements involving electroweak probes where the
initial and final hadronic states are in different frames related by the
momentum transferred by the probe. Finally in many calculations the vacuum is
trivial so the calculations can be formulated in Fock space.
  The advantages of light front-field theory would not be interesting if the
light-front formulation was not equivalent to the covariant or canonical

main objective is not only to cluster individuals into latent classes, but also
to use these classes to develop more complex statistical models. These models
generally divide into a measurement model that relates the latent classes to
observed indicators, and a structural model that relates covariates and outcome
variables to the latent classes. The measurement and structural models can be
estimated jointly using the so-called one-step approach or sequentially using
stepwise methods, which present significant advantages for practitioners
regarding the interpretability of the estimated latent classes. In addition to
the one-step approach, StepMix implements the most important stepwise
estimation methods from the literature, including the bias-adjusted three-step

These pseudo-likelihood estimators are presented in this paper under a unified

significant differences in the temporal evolution of the minimum radius near

lobes inflated by the jets, due both to magnetic collimation and the
development of dynamical instabilities in jets with different magnetic
topologies. In all cases, the simulations show a distinct reversal of the

wave function collapse in the quantum spin measurement process. Specifically,
we calculated the wave function evolution for a simple harmonic oscillator of
spin \frac{1}{2}, with its magnetic moment in interaction with a magnetic
field, coupled to an environment that is a bath of harmonic oscillators. The
system's time evolution is described by the direct product of two independent
Hilbert spaces: one that is defined by an effective Hamiltonian, which
represents a damped simple harmonic oscillator with its potential well divided
into two, based on the spin and the other that represents the effect of the
bath, i.e., the Brownian motion. The initial states of this set of wave
functions form an orthonormal basis, defined as the eigenstates of the system.
If the system is initially in one of these states, the final result is
predetermined, i.e., the measurement is deterministic. If the bath is initially
in the ground state,and the wave function is initially a wave packet at the
origin, it collapses into one of the two potential wells depending on the
initial spin. If the initial spin is a vector in the Bloch sphere not parallel
to the magnetic field, the final distribution among the two potential wells is
given by the Born rule applied to the initial spin state with the well-known
ground state width. Hence, the result is also predetermined. We discuss its
implications to the Bell theorem[1]. We end with a summary of the implications

text-to-image synthesis tasks. However, one critical limitation of these models
is the low fidelity of generated images with respect to the text description,
such as missing objects, mismatched attributes, and mislocated objects. One key
reason for such inconsistencies is the inaccurate cross-attention to text in
both the spatial dimension, which controls at what pixel region an object
should appear, and the temporal dimension, which controls how different levels
of details are added through the denoising steps. In this paper, we propose a
new text-to-image algorithm that adds explicit control over spatial-temporal
cross-attention in diffusion models. We first utilize a layout predictor to
predict the pixel regions for objects mentioned in the text. We then impose
spatial attention control by combining the attention over the entire text
description and that over the local description of the particular object in the
corresponding pixel region of that object. The temporal attention control is
further added by allowing the combination weights to change at each denoising
step, and the combination weights are optimized to ensure high fidelity between
the image and the text. Experiments show that our method generates images with
higher fidelity compared to diffusion-model-based baselines without fine-tuning

scenarios, however, the distribution of test data is different from the
training data. This results in more inaccurate predictions, necessitating
increased human labeling, which is difficult and expensive in many scenarios.
Active learning circumvents this difficulty by only querying the most
informative examples and, in several cases, has been shown to lower the overall
labeling effort. In this work, we bridge the gap between selective prediction
and active learning, proposing a new learning paradigm called active selective
prediction which learns to query more informative samples from the shifted
target domain while increasing accuracy and coverage. For this new problem, we
propose a simple but effective solution, ASPEST, that trains ensembles of model
snapshots using self-training with their aggregated outputs as pseudo labels.
Extensive experiments on several image, text and structured datasets with
domain shifts demonstrate that active selective prediction can significantly
outperform prior work on selective prediction and active learning (e.g. on the
MNIST$\to$SVHN benchmark with the labeling budget of 100, ASPEST improves the
AUC metric from 79.36% to 88.84%) and achieves more optimal utilization of
humans in the loop.

from long-term exploration. However, current appearance-based LCD methods face
significant challenges, including high computational costs, viewpoint variance,

Superpixel Grids (SGs) LCD approach, SGIDN-LCD, to find similarities between
scenes via hand-crafted features extracted from SGs. Unlike traditional
Bag-of-Words (BoW) models requiring pre-training, we propose an adaptive
mechanism to group similar images called $\textbf{\textit{dynamic}}$
$\textbf{\textit{node}}$, which incremental adjusts the database in an online
manner, allowing for efficient retrieval of previously viewed images.
Experimental results demonstrate the SGIDN-LCD significantly improving LCD
precision-recall and efficiency. Moreover, our proposed overall LCD method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple typical datasets.

quality of service, which can be attained in crowded scenarios by extra-large
MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems. Another requirement is to support increasing connected
users in (over)crowded machine-type communication (mMTC). In such scenarios,
pilot assignment (PA) becomes paramount to reduce pilot contamination and
consequently improve spectral efficiency (SE). We propose a novel quasi-optimal
low-complexity iterative pilot assignment strategy for XL-MIMO systems based on
a genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed GA-based PA procedure turns the quality
of service more uniform, taking into account the normalized mean-square error
(NMSE) of channel estimation from each candidate of the population. The
simulations reveal that the proposed iterative procedure minimizes the channel
estimation NMSE averaged over the UEs. The second procedure is the subarray
(SA) selection. In XL-MIMO systems, commonly, a UE is close to a SA antenna
subset such that a sufficient data rate can be achieved if only a specific SA
serves that UE. Thus, a SA selection procedure is investigated to make the
system scalable by defining the maximum number of UEs each SA can help. Hence,
the SA clusters are formatted based on the PA decision. Furthermore, we
introduce an appropriate channel model for XL-MIMO, which considers a
deterministic LoS component with a distance-dependent probability of existence
combined with a stochastic spatially correlated Rayleigh NLoS fading component.
The developed simulations and analyses rely on this suitable channel model
under realistic assumptions of pilot contamination and correlated channels.

where the size decreases with a stringy gravity parameter denoted by $\beta$.
We show that this parameter is constrained by the shadow existence. Combining
the Newman-Janis algorithm and the Hamilton-Jacobi mechanism, we examine the

scale of scientific applications, the efficiency of MPI collective
communications turns out to be a critical bottleneck in large-scale distributed
and parallel processing. Large message size in MPI collectives is a
particularly big concern because it may significantly delay the overall
parallel performance. To address this issue, prior research simply applies the
off-the-shelf fix-rate lossy compressors in the MPI collectives, leading to
suboptimal performance, limited generalizability, and unbounded errors. In this
paper, we propose a novel solution, called C-Coll, which leverages
error-bounded lossy compression to significantly reduce the message size,
resulting in a substantial reduction in communication cost. The key
contributions are three-fold. (1) We develop two general, optimized
lossy-compression-based frameworks for both types of MPI collectives
(collective data movement as well as collective computation), based on their
particular characteristics. Our framework not only reduces communication cost
but also preserves data accuracy. (2) We customize an optimized version based
on SZx, an ultra-fast error-bounded lossy compressor, which can meet the
specific needs of collective communication. (3) We integrate C-Coll into
multiple collectives, such as MPI_Allreduce, MPI_Scatter, and MPI_Bcast, and
perform a comprehensive evaluation based on real-world scientific datasets.
Experiments show that our solution outperforms the original MPI collectives as
well as multiple baselines and related efforts by 3.5-9.7X.

interactions based on user's historical sequential interactions from multiple
domains. Generally, a key challenge of CDSR is how to mine precise cross-domain
user preference based on the intra-sequence and inter-sequence item
interactions. Existing works first learn single-domain user preference only
with intra-sequence item interactions, and then build a transferring module to
obtain cross-domain user preference. However, such a pipeline and implicit
solution can be severely limited by the bottleneck of the designed transferring
module, and ignores to consider inter-sequence item relationships. In this
paper, we propose C^2DSR to tackle the above problems to capture precise user
preferences. The main idea is to simultaneously leverage the intra- and inter-
sequence item relationships, and jointly learn the single- and cross- domain
user preferences. Specifically, we first utilize a graph neural network to mine
inter-sequence item collaborative relationship, and then exploit sequential
attentive encoder to capture intra-sequence item sequential relationship. Based
on them, we devise two different sequential training objectives to obtain user
single-domain and cross-domain representations. Furthermore, we present a novel
contrastive cross-domain infomax objective to enhance the correlation between
single- and cross- domain user representations by maximizing their mutual
information. To validate the effectiveness of C^2DSR, we first re-split four

outperforms the other three priors in terms of representational capability and
visual performance. However, the performance of DIP deteriorates when the

limited by the high density of user devices, which causes a high level of
co-channel interference. This research presents a novel framework that utilizes
spiking neural networks (SNNs) to detect IoT signals in the presence of uplink
interference. The key advantage of SNNs is the extremely low power consumption
relative to traditional deep learning (DL) networks. The performance of the
spiking-based neural network detectors is compared against state-of-the-art DL
networks and the conventional matched filter detector. Results indicate that
both DL and SNN-based receivers surpass the matched filter detector in
interference-heavy scenarios, owing to their capacity to effectively
distinguish target signals amidst co-channel interference. Moreover, our work
highlights the ultra-low power consumption of SNNs compared to other DL methods
for signal detection. The strong detection performance and low power
consumption of SNNs make them particularly suitable for onboard signal
detection in IoT LEO satellites, especially in high interference conditions.

of semantic information and word ambiguity caused by the short length of the
text. Previous works have introduced complement sentences or knowledge bases to
provide additional feature information. However, these methods have not fully
interacted between the original sentence and the complement sentence, and have
not considered the noise issue that may arise from the introduction of external

that combines contrastive learning and external knowledge. The model uses a

contrastive learning method to guide the model to obtain more semantically
meaningful encoding of the original sentence. In addition, to avoid noise, we
use keywords as the main semantics of the original sentence to retrieve
corresponding knowledge words in the knowledge base, and construct a knowledge
graph. The graph encoding model is used to integrate the knowledge base

admits a symmetric diffusion that satisfies sub-Gaussian heat kernel estimates.
A celebrated theorem of Jones (Acta Math. 1981) states that uniform domains in
Euclidean space are extension domains for Sobolev spaces. In this work, we
obtain a similar extension property for metric spaces equipped with a Dirichlet
form whose heat kernel satisfies a sub-Gaussian estimate. We introduce a
scale-invariant version of this extension property and apply it to show that
the reflected diffusion process on such a uniform domain inherits various
properties from the ambient space, such as Harnack inequalities, cutoff energy
inequality, and sub-Gaussian heat kernel bounds. In particular, our work
extends Neumann heat kernel estimates of Gyrya and Saloff-Coste (Ast\'erisque

extension operator imply that the energy measure of the boundary of a uniform
domain is always zero. This property of the energy measure is a broad

Solar Telescope (NVST) observations. The experimental results show that our
method effectively predicts the optical flow of small targets in images
compared with several typical machine- and deep-learning methods. On the Ha
dataset, the proposed method improves the image structure similarity from
0.9182 to 0.9587 and reduces the mean of residuals from 24.9931 to 15.2818; on
the TiO dataset, the proposed method improves the image structure similarity
from 0.9289 to 0.9628 and reduces the mean of residuals from 25.9908 to
17.0194. The optical flow predicted using the proposed method can provide

objects in a video sequence without prior knowledge of these objects. However,
existing ZS-VOS methods often struggle to distinguish between foreground and
background or to keep track of the foreground in complex scenarios. The common
practice of introducing motion information, such as optical flow, can lead to
overreliance on optical flow estimation. To address these challenges, we
propose an encoder-decoder-based hierarchical co-attention propagation network
(HCPN) capable of tracking and segmenting objects. Specifically, our model is
built upon multiple collaborative evolutions of the parallel co-attention
module (PCM) and the cross co-attention module (CCM). PCM captures common
foreground regions among adjacent appearance and motion features, while CCM
further exploits and fuses cross-modal motion features returned by PCM. Our
method is progressively trained to achieve hierarchical spatio-temporal feature
propagation across the entire video. Experimental results demonstrate that our
HCPN outperforms all previous methods on public benchmarks, showcasing its
effectiveness for ZS-VOS.

be right for the wrong reasons are one of the main robustness concerns for
real-world deployments. However, mitigating these correlations during
pre-training for large-scale models can be costly and impractical, particularly
for those without access to high-performance computing resources. This paper
proposes a novel approach to address spurious correlations during fine-tuning
for a given domain of interest. With a focus on multi-modal models (e.g.,
CLIP), the proposed method leverages different modalities in these models to
detect and explicitly set apart spurious attributes from the affected class,
achieved through a multi-modal contrastive loss function that expresses
spurious relationships through language. Our experimental results and in-depth
visualizations on CLIP show that such an intervention can effectively i)
improve the model's accuracy when spurious attributes are not present, and ii)
directs the model's activation maps towards the actual class rather than the
spurious attribute when present. In particular, on the Waterbirds dataset, our
algorithm achieved a worst-group accuracy 23% higher than ERM on CLIP with a
ResNet-50 backbone, and 32% higher on CLIP with a ViT backbone, while
maintaining the same average accuracy as ERM.

bulk spectral functions look similar in both the cases, the surface spectra are
very different; the surface-bulk difference is significantly weaker in CeCuAs2
compared to that observed in CeCuSb2. A distinct low binding energy peak is
observed in the Ce 3d spectra akin to the scenario observed in cuprates and

corresponding feature appear at lower binding energy. Ce 3d core level spectra

insignificant in the bulk. In addition, we observe a features at binding energy

it to be a bulk property. Increase in temperature leads to a spectral weight
transfer to higher binding energies in the core level spectra and a depletion

photometric range imaging technique that makes it possible to obtain 3D
renderings from a cloud of 2D images. To explore the possibility of 3D
reconstruction via SfM from infrared images, this article proposes a
photometric correction model for infrared sensors based on temperature
constancy. Photometric correction is accomplished by estimating the scene
irradiance as the values from the solution to a differential equation for
microbolometer pixel excitation with unknown coefficients and initial
conditions. The model was integrated into an SfM framework and experimental
evaluations demonstrate the contribution of the photometric correction for
improving the estimates of both the camera motion and the scene structure.
Further, experiments show that the reconstruction quality from the corrected

Although imposing fairness constraints have been studied extensively for

molecular dynamics simulation with thermodynamic and diffusion theories. Our
study systematically examined the equilibrium distribution of hydrogen-methane
mixtures in gravity fields. We demonstrated that partial pressures of both
gases decrease with altitude, with hydrogen showing slower decrease due to its
smaller molar mass. As a result, the volume fraction of hydrogen is maximized
at the top end of pipes. The stratification is more favorable at low
temperature and large altitude drops, with notable gas stratification only
occurring at extremely large drops in altitude, being generally negligible even
at a drop of 1500 m. Furthermore, we showed that the diffusion time required to
achieve the equilibrium distribution is proportional to gas pressure and the
square of pipeline height. This requires approximately 300 years for a 1500 m

transportation will not cause visible stratification. Our work clarifies the
effect of gravity on hydrogen-methane gas mixtures and provides quantitative

efficiently generate complete, realistic, and animatable head avatars. This
task is challenging, and it is difficult for existing methods to satisfy all
the requirements at once. To achieve these goals, we propose GANHead
(Generative Animatable Neural Head Avatar), a novel generative head model that
takes advantages of both the fine-grained control over the explicit expression
parameters and the realistic rendering results of implicit representations.
Specifically, GANHead represents coarse geometry, fine-gained details and
texture via three networks in canonical space to obtain the ability to generate
complete and realistic head avatars. To achieve flexible animation, we define
the deformation filed by standard linear blend skinning (LBS), with the learned
continuous pose and expression bases and LBS weights. This allows the avatars
to be directly animated by FLAME parameters and generalize well to unseen poses
and expressions. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, GANHead achieves
superior performance on head avatar generation and raw scan fitting.

as spacetime, quantum theory lacks a standard notion of how to encapsulate the
dynamical evolution of a quantum state into a single ""state over time"".
Recently it was emphasized in the work of Fitzsimons, Jones and Vedral that if
such a state over time is to encode not only spatial but also temporal
correlations which exist within a quantum dynamical process, then it should be
represented not by a density matrix, but rather, by a pseudo-density matrix. A
pseudo-density matrix is a hermitian matrix of unit trace whose marginals are
density matrices, and in this work, we make use a factorization system for
quantum channels to associate a pseudo-density matrix with a quantum state
which is to evolve according to a finite sequence of quantum channels. We then
make an in-depth mathematical analysis of such pseudo-density matrices and the
properties they satisfy, and show that in the case of dynamical evolution of a
closed system of qubits we recover the standard pseudo-density matrix formalism
of Fitzsimons, Jones and Vedral. Conversely, we show how to explicitly extract
quantum dynamics from a given pseudo-density matrix, thus solving an open

paper, we study the robustness of deep learning models against joint

Adversarial (SPA) attack, which can then be used to enhance adversarial
training. Specifically, we introduce an attribute manipulator to generate
natural and human-comprehensible perturbations and a noise generator to
generate diverse adversarial noises. Based on such combined noises, we optimize
both the attribute value and the diversity variable to generate
jointly-perturbed samples. For robust training, we adversarially train the deep
learning model against the generated joint perturbations. Empirical results on
four benchmarks show that the SPA attack causes a larger performance decline
with small $l_{\infty}$ norm-ball constraints compared to existing approaches.
Furthermore, our SPA-enhanced training outperforms existing defense methods
against such joint perturbations.

Developed and implemented anomaly-detection algorithm based on distance metrics

controversies resulting from attaching meaning to the symbols used in the
latter. In particular, we show that adopting this view offers new perspectives
for constructing mathematical models for and interpreting the results of
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments. We first prove new Bell-type
inequalities constraining the values of the four correlations obtained by
performing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments under four different
conditions. The proof is ``model-free'' in the sense that it does not refer to
any mathematical model that one imagines to have produced the data. The
constraints only depend on the number of quadruples obtained by reshuffling the
data in the four data sets without changing the values of the correlations.
These new inequalities reduce to model-free versions of the well-known
Bell-type inequalities if the maximum fraction of quadruples is equal to one.
Being model-free, a violation of the latter by experimental data implies that
not all the data in the four data sets can be reshuffled to form quadruples.
Furthermore, being model-free inequalities, a violation of the latter by
experimental data only implies that any mathematical model assumed to produce
this data does not apply. Starting from the data obtained by performing
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments, we construct instead of postulate
mathematical models that describe the main features of these data. The
mathematical framework of plausible reasoning is applied to reproducible and
robust data, yielding without using any concept of quantum theory, the
expression of the correlation for a system of two spin-1/2 objects in the
singlet state. (truncated here)

electron-doped ($t_2>0$) and hole-doped ($t_2<0$) cuprates, by employing the
state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations. On 6-leg
cylindrical system, while different CDW phases are identified on the hole-doped
side for the doping range $\delta= 1/16-1/8$, a superconducting (SC) phase
emerges at lower doping regime, where the pairing correlations exhibit a
power-law decay with $d$-wave symmetry. On the wider 8-leg system, the $d$-wave
SC also emerges on the hole-doped side at the optimal $1/8$ doping,
demonstrating a change of the ground-state nature by increasing system width.
Our results highlight rich possibilities for the emergence of superconductivity

  Networks (IJCNN), Queensland, Australia, June 2023",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Capsule Networks (CapsNets) are able to hierarchically preserve the pose
relationships between multiple objects for image classification tasks. Other
than achieving high accuracy, another relevant factor in deploying CapsNets in
safety-critical applications is the robustness against input transformations
and malicious adversarial attacks.
  In this paper, we systematically analyze and evaluate different factors
affecting the robustness of CapsNets, compared to traditional Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). Towards a comprehensive comparison, we test two CapsNet
models and two CNN models on the MNIST, GTSRB, and CIFAR10 datasets, as well as
on the affine-transformed versions of such datasets. With a thorough analysis,
we show which properties of these architectures better contribute to increasing
the robustness and their limitations. Overall, CapsNets achieve better
robustness against adversarial examples and affine transformations, compared to
a traditional CNN with a similar number of parameters. Similar conclusions have
been derived for deeper versions of CapsNets and CNNs. Moreover, our results
unleash a key finding that the dynamic routing does not contribute much to
improving the CapsNets' robustness. Indeed, the main generalization
contribution is due to the hierarchical feature learning through capsules.

shown to achieve significant improvements in memory utilization and compute
throughput with little or no accuracy loss compared to full-precision
floating-point. Modern FPGA-based DNN inference relies heavily on the on-chip
block RAM (BRAM) for model storage and the digital signal processing (DSP) unit
for implementing the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation, a fundamental DNN
primitive. In this paper, we enhance the existing BRAM to also compute MAC by
proposing BRAMAC (Compute-in-$\underline{\text{BR}}$AM
$\underline{\text{A}}$rchitectures for
$\underline{\text{M}}$ultiply-$\underline{\text{Ac}}$cumulate). BRAMAC supports
2's complement 2- to 8-bit MAC in a small dummy BRAM array using a hybrid
bit-serial & bit-parallel data flow. Unlike previous compute-in-BRAM
architectures, BRAMAC allows read/write access to the main BRAM array while
computing in the dummy BRAM array, enabling both persistent and tiling-based
DNN inference. We explore two BRAMAC variants: BRAMAC-2SA (with 2 synchronous
dummy arrays) and BRAMAC-1DA (with 1 double-pumped dummy array).
BRAMAC-2SA/BRAMAC-1DA can boost the peak MAC throughput of a large Arria-10
FPGA by 2.6$\times$/2.1$\times$, 2.3$\times$/2.0$\times$, and
1.9$\times$/1.7$\times$ for 2-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit precisions, respectively at
the cost of 6.8%/3.4% increase in the FPGA core area. By adding
BRAMAC-2SA/BRAMAC-1DA to a state-of-the-art tiling-based DNN accelerator, an
average speedup of 2.05$\times$/1.7$\times$ and 1.33$\times$/1.52$\times$ can
be achieved for AlexNet and ResNet-34, respectively across different model
precisions.

four different realistic choices for the branching ratios of their decays to

options for the branching fraction of their decays to the $K^-p$ channel (0.01

innovative solutions to tackle catastrophic forgetting, like knowledge

have recently attracted increasing attention. Since TKGs are intrinsically
incomplete, it is necessary to reason out missing elements. Although existing
TKG reasoning methods have the ability to predict missing future events, they

graphs starts showing superior explainability and performance in recent
advances, it has opened up opportunities for exploring RL techniques on TKG

limited due to: (1) lack of ability to capture temporal evolution and semantic
dependence jointly; (2) excessive reliance on manually designed rewards. To
overcome these challenges, we propose an adaptive reinforcement learning model

Specifically, the model contains two components: (1) a multi-faceted attention
representation learning method that captures semantic dependence and temporal

nodes efficiently (in $poly(n)$ time) is a long standing open question in the
study of height balancing in tree data structures. In this paper, we initiate
the study of this problem bounding the rank of the trees given at the input
(defined by Ehrenfeucht and Haussler (1989) in the context of decision trees).
We define the rank-bounded rotation distance between two given binary trees
$T_1$ and $T_2$ (with $n$ internal nodes) of rank at most $r$, denoted by
$d_r(T_1,T_2)$, as the length of the shortest sequence of rotations that
transforms $T_1$ to $T_2$ with the restriction that the intermediate trees must
be of rank at most $r$. We show that the rotation distance problem reduces in
polynomial time to the rank bounded rotation distance problem. This motivates
the study of the problem in the combinatorial and algorithmic frontiers.
Observing that trees with rank $1$ coincide exactly with skew trees (binary
trees where every internal node has at least one leaf as a child), we show the
following results in this frontier :
  We present an $O(n^2)$ time algorithm for computing $d_1(T_1,T_2)$. That is,
when the given trees are skew trees (we call this variant as skew rotation
distance problem) - where the intermediate trees are restricted to be skew as
well. In particular, our techniques imply that for any two skew trees
$d(T_1,T_2) \le n^2$.
  We show the following upper bound : for any two trees $T_1$ and $T_2$ of rank
at most $r_1$ and $r_2$ respectively, we have that: $d_r(T_1,T_2) \le n^2
(1+(2n+1)(r_1+r_2-2))$ where $r = max\{r_1,r_2\}$. This bound is asymptotically
tight for $r=1$.
  En route our proof of the above theorems, we associate binary trees to
permutations and bivariate polynomials, and prove several characterizations in
the case of skew trees.

McNemar's test aims to infer the presence of a significant difference between
the error rates of the two classification algorithms. However, the power of the
conventional McNemar's test is usually unpromising because the hold-out (HO)
method in the test merely uses a single train-validation split that usually
produces a highly varied estimation of the error rates. In contrast, a
cross-validation (CV) method repeats the HO method in multiple times and
produces a stable estimation. Therefore, a CV method has a great advantage to
improve the power of McNemar's test. Among all types of CV methods, a
block-regularized 5$\times$2 CV (BCV) has been shown in many previous studies
to be superior to the other CV methods in the comparison task of algorithms
because the 5$\times$2 BCV can produce a high-quality estimator of the error
rate by regularizing the numbers of overlapping records between all training
sets. In this study, we compress the 10 correlated contingency tables in the
5$\times$2 BCV to form an effective contingency table. Then, we define a
5$\times$2 BCV McNemar's test on the basis of the effective contingency table.
We demonstrate the reasonable type I error and the promising power of the

found that the icosahedral motifs (which are the signature of the short-range
ordering) and distorted BCC-like clusters dominate in the liquid and glass
region under 0 and 5 Gpa external pressure. A first-order phase transition to a
crystal-like structure was observed at 10, 15, and 20 Gpa external pressure at
1400, 1500, and 1600 K, respectively. Before the first-order phase transition,
the system was dominated by icosahedral and distorted BCC-like clusters. When
the temperature is lowered further below the glass transition at 10,15, and 20
Gpa external pressure, all structural analyses show that the solidified system
consists mainly of body-centered cubic-like clusters in the case of our
specific cooling rate of 1012 K/s.

to the lack of paired real data and robust priors. In this work, we present a
new paradigm for real image dehazing from the perspectives of synthesizing more
realistic hazy data and introducing more robust priors into the network.
Specifically, (1) instead of adopting the de facto physical scattering model,
we rethink the degradation of real hazy images and propose a phenomenological
pipeline considering diverse degradation types. (2) We propose a Real Image
Dehazing network via high-quality Codebook Priors (RIDCP). Firstly, a VQGAN is
pre-trained on a large-scale high-quality dataset to obtain the discrete
codebook, encapsulating high-quality priors (HQPs). After replacing the
negative effects brought by haze with HQPs, the decoder equipped with a novel
normalized feature alignment module can effectively utilize high-quality
features and produce clean results. However, although our degradation pipeline
drastically mitigates the domain gap between synthetic and real data, it is
still intractable to avoid it, which challenges HQPs matching in the wild.
Thus, we re-calculate the distance when matching the features to the HQPs by a
controllable matching operation, which facilitates finding better counterparts.
We provide a recommendation to control the matching based on an explainable
solution. Users can also flexibly adjust the enhancement degree as per their
preference. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our data
synthesis pipeline and the superior performance of RIDCP in real image
dehazing.

providing accurate predictions of energy demand. Our approach aligns with SDG
13 on climate action, enabling more efficient management of renewable energy
resources. We use long short-term memory networks, well-suited for time series

proposed approach is evaluated using four historical short-term energy demand

Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection. The proposed model is also
compared with three other state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms: Facebook

analysis of the CO moment and channel maps, as well as kinematic modelling
reveals two main components in the molecular gas: one rotating in the galaxy
plane and another outflowing and extending up to $\sim$ 1.8 -- 2.6 kpc from the
nucleus, partially encasing the ionised component. The mass of the outflowing
molecular gas component is $M_{\mathrm{mol},\mathrm{out}}$ =
$(2.5\pm1.6){\times}10^{6}$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$, representing $\sim$ 1.7 -- 2 % of
the total molecular gas seen in emission within the inner 2.3 kpc. The
corresponding mass outflow rate and power are
$\dot{M}_{\mathrm{mol},\mathrm{out}}$ = 0.12 -- 0.72 $\rm{M_{\odot} yr^{-1}}$

AGN power of only $10^{-4}$ -- 0.02 %. This value reaches up to 0.1 % when
including both the feedback in the ionised and molecular gas, as well as
considering that only part of the energy couples kinetically with the gas. Some
of the non-rotating CO emission can also be attributed to inflow in the galaxy
plane towards the nucleus. The similarity of the CO outflow -- encasing the
ionised gas one and the X-ray emission -- to those seen in other sources,
suggests that this may be a common property of galactic outflows.

a synchronous dual-motor system is also proposed to take action in faulty

fault corresponding to overloading, finally experimental setup results in
99.9997% accuracy during testing for a model with nearly 8000 parameters. In
addition, the proposed dual-motor system could achieve overload reduction and
provide a fault-tolerant system and it is shown that this system also takes

flow of its boundary hypersurface exists for all time and asymptotically

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:2211.15977",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been widely adopted as practical and
versatile representations for 3D scenes, facilitating various downstream tasks.
However, different architectures, including plain Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
Tensors, low-rank Tensors, Hashtables, and their compositions, have their
trade-offs. For instance, Hashtables-based representations allow for faster
rendering but lack clear geometric meaning, making spatial-relation-aware
editing challenging. To address this limitation and maximize the potential of
each architecture, we propose Progressive Volume Distillation with Active
Learning (PVD-AL), a systematic distillation method that enables any-to-any
conversions between different architectures. PVD-AL decomposes each structure
into two parts and progressively performs distillation from shallower to deeper
volume representation, leveraging effective information retrieved from the
rendering process. Additionally, a Three-Levels of active learning technique
provides continuous feedback during the distillation process, resulting in
high-performance results. Empirical evidence is presented to validate our
method on multiple benchmark datasets. For example, PVD-AL can distill an
MLP-based model from a Hashtables-based model at a 10~20X faster speed and
0.8dB~2dB higher PSNR than training the NeRF model from scratch. Moreover,
PVD-AL permits the fusion of diverse features among distinct structures,
enabling models with multiple editing properties and providing a more efficient
model to meet real-time requirements. Project website:http://sk-fun.fun/PVD-AL.

similarity between two nodes in a graph and has been applied in a plethora of
data management tasks. These tasks often involve single-source SimRank
computation that evaluates the SimRank values between a source node $s$ and all
other nodes. Due to its high computation complexity, single-source SimRank
computation for large graphs is notoriously challenging, and hence recent
studies resort to distributed processing. To our surprise, although SimRank has
been widely adopted for two decades, theoretical aspects of distributed
SimRanks with provable results have rarely been studied.
  In this paper, we conduct a theoretical study on single-source SimRank
computation in the Massive Parallel Computation (MPC) model, which is the
standard theoretical framework modeling distributed systems such as MapReduce,
Hadoop, or Spark. Existing distributed SimRank algorithms enforce either
$\Omega(\log n)$ communication round complexity or $\Omega(n)$ machine space
for a graph of $n$ nodes. We overcome this barrier. Particularly, given a graph
of $n$ nodes, for any query node $v$ and constant error $\epsilon>\frac{3}{n}$,
we show that using $O(\log^2 \log n)$ rounds of communication among machines is
almost enough to compute single-source SimRank values with at most $\epsilon$
absolute errors, while each machine only needs a space sub-linear to $n$. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first single-source SimRank algorithm in
MPC that can overcome the $\Theta(\log n)$ round complexity barrier with
provable result accuracy.

algorithm (RL-GP) is proposed to enhance the quality of solutions. The RL-GP
adopts the ensemble population strategies. Before the population evolution at

according to the information obtained, thus realizing a sound balance of
exploration and exploitation. In addition, surrogate models are used in the
algorithm to evaluate the formation plans generated by individuals, which
speeds up the algorithm learning process. Afterward, a series of comparison
experiments are conducted to verify the overall performance of RL-GP and the
effectiveness of the improved strategies within the algorithm. The
hyper-heuristic rules obtained through efficient learning can be utilized as
decision-making aids when forming project teams. This study reveals the
advantages of reinforcement learning methods, ensemble strategies, and the
surrogate model applied to the GP framework. The diversity and intelligent
selection of search patterns along with fast adaptation evaluation, are
distinct features that enable RL-GP to be deployed in real-world enterprise

pairs, is beneficial to learn informative skeleton representations in
unsupervised skeleton-based action recognition. To achieve these positive and
negative pairs, existing weak/strong data augmentation methods have to randomly
change the appearance of skeletons for indirectly pursuing semantic
perturbations. However, such approaches have two limitations: 1) solely
perturbing appearance cannot well capture the intrinsic semantic information of
skeletons, and 2) randomly perturbation may change the original
positive/negative pairs to soft positive/negative ones. To address the above
dilemma, we start the first attempt to explore an attack-based augmentation
scheme that additionally brings in direct semantic perturbation, for
constructing hard positive pairs and further assisting in constructing hard
negative pairs. In particular, we propose a novel Attack-Augmentation
Mixing-Contrastive learning (A$^2$MC) to contrast hard positive features and
hard negative features for learning more robust skeleton representations. In
A$^2$MC, Attack-Augmentation (Att-Aug) is designed to collaboratively perform

respectively, for generating high-quality hard positive features. Meanwhile,
Positive-Negative Mixer (PNM) is presented to mix hard positive features and
negative features for generating hard negative features, which are adopted for
updating the mixed memory banks. Extensive experiments on three public datasets
demonstrate that A$^2$MC is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods.

theory. A gambler is sent values online, sampled from an instance of
independent distributions, in an adversarial, random or selected order,
depending on the model. When observing each value, the gambler either accepts
it as a reward or irrevocably rejects it and proceeds to observe the next
value. The goal of the gambler, who cannot see the future, is maximising the
expected value of the reward while competing against the expectation of a
prophet (the offline maximum). In other words, one seeks to maximise the
gambler-to-prophet ratio of the expectations.
  The model, in which the gambler selects the arrival order first, and then
observes the values, is known as Order Selection. Recently it has been shown
that in this model a ratio of $0.7251$ can be attained for any instance. If the
gambler chooses the arrival order (uniformly) at random, we obtain the Random
Order model. The worst case ratio over all possible instances has been
extensively studied for at least $40$ years. Still, it is not known if
carefully choosing the order, or simply taking it at random, benefits the

both global and local input features to convert SimPX to 3D output. At
inference, a real PX image is translated to a SimPX-style image with semantic

generalized to Riemannian manifolds for solving optimization problems with an

media, with a focus on the influence of the porosity in the non-Darcy regime,
which has received little attention in previous research. The numerical model
is based on the lattice Boltzmann method with a multiple-relaxation-time scheme
and employs an immersed boundary method to describe the fluid-solid
interaction. The simulations are conducted in a two-dimensional,
horizontally-periodic domain with an aspect ratio of 4, and the porosity is
varied from 0.7 to 1, while the solute Rayleigh number ranges from 4*10^6 to
4*10^9. Our results show that, for all explored Rayleigh number, solute
transport first enhances unexpectedly with decreasing porosity, and then
decreases when porosity is smaller than a Rayleigh number-dependent value. On
the other hand, while the flow strength decreases significantly as porosity
decreases at low Rayleigh number, it varies weakly with decreasing porosity at
high Rayleigh number and even increases counterintuitively for some porosities
at moderate Rayleigh number. Detailed analysis of the salinity and velocity
fields reveals that the fingered structures are blocked by the porous structure
and can even be destroyed when their widths are larger than the pore scale, but
become more ordered and coherent with the presence of porous media. This
combination of opposing effects explains the complex porosity-dependencies of
solute transport and flow strength. The influence of porous structure
arrangement is also examined, with stronger effects observed for smaller
porosity and higher Rayleigh number. These findings have important implications
for passive control of mass/solute transport in engineering applications.

where there is noise correlated with Gaussian covariates. In regression models,
the phenomenon of the correlated noise is called endogeneity, which is due to

been common to assume sparsity on the true parameters and estimate them using
regularization, even with the endogeneity. However, when sparsity does not

off-chip memory accesses dominate the energy consumption of SNN processing.
However, state-of-the-art works do not optimize the DRAM energy-per-access,
thereby hindering the SNN-based systems from achieving further energy
efficiency gains. To substantially reduce the DRAM energy-per-access, an
effective solution is to decrease the DRAM supply voltage, but it may lead to
errors in DRAM cells (i.e., so-called approximate DRAM). Towards this, we
propose \textit{EnforceSNN}, a novel design framework that provides a solution
for resilient and energy-efficient SNN inference using reduced-voltage DRAM for
embedded systems. The key mechanisms of our EnforceSNN are: (1) employing
quantized weights to reduce the DRAM access energy; (2) devising an efficient
DRAM mapping policy to minimize the DRAM energy-per-access; (3) analyzing the
SNN error tolerance to understand its accuracy profile considering different
bit error rate (BER) values; (4) leveraging the information for developing an
efficient fault-aware training (FAT) that considers different BER values and
bit error locations in DRAM to improve the SNN error tolerance; and (5)
developing an algorithm to select the SNN model that offers good trade-offs
among accuracy, memory, and energy consumption. The experimental results show
that our EnforceSNN maintains the accuracy (i.e., no accuracy loss for BER
less-or-equal 10^-3) as compared to the baseline SNN with accurate DRAM, while
achieving up to 84.9\% of DRAM energy saving and up to 4.1x speed-up of DRAM

methodology to mitigate permanent faults in the compute engine of SNN chips
without requiring additional retraining, thereby significantly cutting down the

The key ideas of our RescueSNN methodology are (1) analyzing the
characteristics of SNN under permanent faults; (2) leveraging this analysis to
improve the SNN fault-tolerance through effective fault-aware mapping (FAM);
and (3) devising lightweight hardware enhancements to support FAM. Our FAM
technique leverages the fault map of SNN compute engine for (i) minimizing
weight corruption when mapping weight bits on the faulty memory cells, and (ii)
selectively employing faulty neurons that do not cause significant accuracy
degradation to maintain accuracy and throughput, while considering the SNN
operations and processing dataflow. The experimental results show that our
RescueSNN improves accuracy by up to 80% while maintaining the throughput
reduction below 25% in high fault rate (e.g., 0.5 of the potential fault
locations), as compared to running SNNs on the faulty chip without mitigation.

weights and a control process of the weight increase which maintains the
in-distribution loss under an acceptable threshold. The developed approach does
not require any out-of-distribution training data neither any trade-off

language models directly to the seq2seq task. Despite the significant
advancements in applying language models to the seq2seq task, there is still a
lack of thorough analysis on the effectiveness of the decoder-only language

detailed comparison between the encoder-decoder architecture and the

encoder-decoder structure. This structure is designed to replicate all
behaviors in the classical decoder-only language model but has an encoder and a

humans, automatic indexing algorithms are imperfect and may assign wrong terms
to documents, which affect subsequent search tasks where queries contain these
terms. In this work, we aim to understand the performance impact of using
imperfectly assigned terms in Boolean semantic searches. We used MeSH terms and
biomedical literature search as a case study. We implemented multiple automatic
indexing algorithms on real-world Boolean queries that consist of MeSH terms,
and found that (1) probabilistic logic can handle inaccurately assigned terms
better than traditional Boolean logic, (2) query-level performance is mostly
limited by lowest-performing terms in a query, and (3) mixing a small amount of
human indexing with automatic indexing can regain excellent query-level
performance. These findings provide important implications for future work on

language based on unspoken alternatives. While empirical studies have
demonstrated that human SI rates are highly variable -- both within instances

that quantitatively explain both cross- and within-scale variation.
Furthermore, while it is generally assumed that SIs arise through reasoning
about unspoken alternatives, it remains debated whether humans reason about
alternatives as linguistic forms, or at the level of concepts. Here, we test a
shared mechanism explaining SI rates within and across scales: context-driven
expectations about the unspoken alternatives. Using neural language models to
approximate human predictive distributions, we find that SI rates are captured
by the expectedness of the strong scalemate as an alternative. Crucially,
however, expectedness robustly predicts cross-scale variation only under a

  To fill the gap and provide accurate trial outcome prediction, we propose
Sequential Predictive mOdeling of clinical Trial outcome (SPOT) that first
identifies trial topics to cluster the multi-sourced trial data into relevant
trial topics. It then generates trial embeddings and organizes them by topic

ethos, and pathos. While in science, logos (reason) and, recently also, ethos
(morality) are discussed as aspects not to be neglected, pathos (feeling) is
seen critically. In this work, we take a historical perspective on pathos and
weigh the pros and cons of applying this rhetorical concept to the field of
data visualizations. To better understand data, connecting it to the human way
of thinking is imperative - appealing to emotions is one building block. The
theoretical and empirical basis originates from different scientific fields,
like social sciences, economics, and humanities. Tangible techniques to target
empathetic emotions in data visualizations are introduced, as well as other
rhetorical devices, such as interactivity and contextual framing, are
highlighted. Researching these different approaches can provide new insights
regarding the creation and influence of empathetic emotions in data
visualizations.

contains all the invertible elements of the ring $\mathbb{Z}_n$. In particular,
we prove that if $n=q$ is a power of an odd prime, then $A$ is a union of sets
of the form $\{ a\cdot(\pm2^i)\}$. Additionally, we count the number of subsets

equation to a first-order differential equation. This reduction is possible due
to the special scaling property of the Thomas-Fermi equation under homology
transformations. Such reductions are well known in the context of stellar
astrophysics, where the use of homology-invariant variables has long proved
useful. We use homology-invariant variables in the context of the Thomas-Fermi
equation to demystify the origin of the otherwise mysterious Majorana
transformation.

field of statistical physics had focused their efforts on developing models of
neural networks that could display memory storage and retrieval. Though many
associative memory models were easy to handle and still quite effective to
explain the basic memory retrieval processes in the brain, they were not
satisfactory under the biological point of view. It became clear to scientists
that a biologically realistic neural network should have respected typical
features that were observed in experiments of neurophysiology. This aspect has
led to the introduction of Balanced Networks, systems where excitatory and
inhibitory neurons balance their effect on each other as an emergent property
of the network dynamics. One of such models is the exhibition of a mean level
of neuronal activity (i.e. the average spiking rate of neurons) that is
univocally defined by a linear equation in the external input. This aspect
might help to reproduce what is measured in particular areas devoted to memory
storage, i.e. a persistent activity during the memory retrieval performance.
Even though progresses in the matter of balanced networks where achieved in the
last two decades, there is still no complete theory that conciliates memory
retrieval and balance in a network of neurons. The aim of this work is to
develop a biologically plausible model that presents both balance and memory
retrieval, building on a framework of mean field equations that can predict the
theoretical behaviour of the network under the choice of a set of control
parameters. We will thus measure the critical capacity of the system as a
function of these parameters, comparing the theoretical results with the
numerical simulations.

some relations between graded weakly $J_{gr}$-semiprime submodules and graded
weakly semiprime submodules. In addition, the necessary and sufficient
condition for graded submodules to be graded weakly $J_{gr}$-semiprime

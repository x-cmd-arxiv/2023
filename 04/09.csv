is a problem of enormous practical interest. An ideal representation of a
quantum state combines a succinct characterization informed by the system's
structure and symmetries, along with the ability to predict the physical
observables of interest. A number of machine learning approaches have been
recently used to construct such classical representations [1-6] which enable
predictions of observables [7] and account for physical symmetries [8].
However, the structure of a quantum state gets typically lost unless a
specialized ansatz is employed based on prior knowledge of the system [9-12].
Moreover, most such approaches give no information about what states are easier
to learn in comparison to others. Here, we propose a new generative
energy-based representation of quantum many-body states derived from Gibbs
distributions used for modeling the thermal states of classical spin systems.
Based on the prior information on a family of quantum states, the energy
function can be specified by a small number of parameters using an explicit
low-degree polynomial or a generic parametric family such as neural nets, and
can naturally include the known symmetries of the system. Our results show that
such a representation can be efficiently learned from data using exact
algorithms in a form that enables the prediction of expectation values of
physical observables. Importantly, the structure of the learned energy function
provides a natural explanation for the hardness of learning for a given class
of quantum states.

the expensive costs of collecting adequate well-labeled training data,
especially for deep learning methods. However, traditional SSL is built upon an
assumption that labeled and unlabeled data should be from the same distribution
e.g., classes and domains. However, in practical scenarios, unlabeled data
would be from unseen classes or unseen domains, and it is still challenging to
exploit them by existing SSL methods. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a
unified framework to leverage these unseen unlabeled data for open-scenario
semi-supervised medical image classification. We first design a novel scoring
mechanism, called dual-path outliers estimation, to identify samples from
unseen classes. Meanwhile, to extract unseen-domain samples, we then apply an
effective variational autoencoder (VAE) pre-training. After that, we conduct
domain adaptation to fully exploit the value of the detected unseen-domain
samples to boost semi-supervised training. We evaluated our proposed framework
on dermatology and ophthalmology tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
model can achieve superior classification performance in various medical SSL
scenarios.

The severity of MS disease is monitored by the Expanded Disability Status Scale

classification of MS disease severity is critical for slowing down or
preventing disease progression via applying early therapeutic intervention
strategies. Recent advances in deep learning and the wide use of Electronic

to a varying stimulus. However, response of such systems may be sensitive to
multiple stimuli (i.e., input features) that are not necessarily independent.
As a consequence, the shape of response curves generated for a selected input
feature (referred to as ""active feature"") might depend on the values of the
other input features (referred to as ""passive features""). In this work, we
consider the case of systems whose response is approximated using regression
neural networks. We propose to use counterfactual explanations (CFEs) for the
identification of the features with the highest relevance on the shape of
response curves generated by neural network black boxes. CFEs are generated by
a genetic algorithm-based approach that solves a multi-objective optimization
problem. In particular, given a response curve generated for an active feature,
a CFE finds the minimum combination of passive features that need to be
modified to alter the shape of the response curve. We tested our method on a
synthetic dataset with 1-D inputs and two crop yield prediction datasets with
2-D inputs. The relevance ranking of features and feature combinations obtained
on the synthetic dataset coincided with the analysis of the equation that was
used to generate the problem. Results obtained on the yield prediction datasets
revealed that the impact on fertilizer responsivity of passive features depends
on the terrain characteristics of each field.

Lyapunov function (CLF) methods with the actor-critic method in RL to propose a
Barrier-Lyapunov Actor-Critic (BLAC) framework which helps maintain the

additional backup controller is introduced in case the RL-based controller

cannot be satisfied simultaneously. Simulation results show that this framework
yields a controller that can help the system approach the desired state and

results from the algorithm runs should not only be good for every run in terms
of performance but also that the performance of multiple runs should not
fluctuate too much, i.e., the algorithm shows good insensitivity. Considering
that substantial computational resources are requested for each run, it is
essential to improve upon the performance of the large-scale multiobjective
optimization algorithm, as well as the insensitivity of the algorithm. However,
existing large-scale multiobjective optimization algorithms solely focus on

variables to construct new nodes on the Monte Carlo tree for optimization and
evaluation. It selects nodes with good evaluation for further search to reduce
the performance sensitivity caused by large-scale decision variables. We

Morpho-constitutional Analysis, MCA) is time-consuming, expensive and requires
a great deal of experience, as it requires a visual analysis component that is

developed for in-vivo endoscopic stone recognition. Deep Learning (DL) based
methods outperform non-DL methods in terms of accuracy but lack explainability.
Despite this trade-off, when it comes to making high-stakes decisions, it's
important to prioritize understandable Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CADx) that
suggests a course of action based on reasonable evidence, rather than a model
prescribing a course of action. In this proposal, we learn Prototypical Parts
(PPs) per kidney stone subtype, which are used by the DL model to generate an
output classification. Using PPs in the classification task enables case-based
reasoning explanations for such output, thus making the model interpretable. In
addition, we modify global visual characteristics to describe their relevance
to the PPs and the sensitivity of our model's performance. With this, we
provide explanations with additional information at the sample, class and model
levels in contrast to previous works. Although our implementation's average
accuracy is lower than state-of-the-art (SOTA) non-interpretable DL models by
1.5 %, our models perform 2.8% better on perturbed images with a lower standard

Lorentz-violating symmetry scenario. The theoretical model adopted consists of
a real massive scalar quantum field confined in a region between two large
parallel plates, having its dynamics governed by a modified Klein-Gordon
equation that presents a Lorentz symmetry breaking term. In this context we
admit that the quantum field obeys specific boundary conditions on the plates.
The Lorentz-violating symmetry is implemented by the presence of an arbitrary
constant space-like vector in a CPT-even aether-like approach, considering a
direct coupling between this vector with the derivative of the field in higher
order. The modification on the Klein-Gordon equation produces important
corrections on the Casimir energy and pressure. Thus, we show that these
corrections strongly depend on the order of the higher derivative term and the
specific direction of the constant vector, as well as the boundary conditions
considered.

dominating the phase stability has become a hot topic since the discovery of
rock salt structure entropy-stabilized (ES)(MgCoNiCuZn)O in 2015. Herein, we
report a set of novel entropy-stabilized fluorite oxides:
Zr0.2Hf0.2Ce0.2Sn0.2Mn0.2O2-{\delta}, Zr0.2Hf0.2Ti0.2Mn0.2Ce0.2O2-{\delta},
Zr0.225Hf0.225Ti0.225Mn0.225Ce0.1O2-{\delta}, and
Zr0.2Hf0.2Ti0.2Mn0.2Ce0.1Ta0.05Fe0.05O2-{\delta} synthesized using standard
solid-state reaction. These compounds have been investigated using X-ray
diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
techniques to discern their structural, microstructural, and chemical
properties. The configurational-entropy dominated phase stability and hence the
entropy stabilization of the compounds is confirmed by cyclic heat treatments.
The mismatch in the ionic radii and oxidation state of the cations are the key
factors in achieving a single-phase fluorite structure. Further, screening of
physical properties including thermal conductivity, optical band gap, magnetic
properties, and impedance spectroscopy is discussed. Thermal conductivity of
1.4-1.7 Wm-1K-1 is observed at 300 K and remains mostly invariant across a wide
temperature range (300K-1073K), favorable for thermal barrier coating
applications. These ES samples have an optical band gap of 1.6-1.8 eV, enabling
light absorption across the visible spectrum and hence could be promising for
photocatalytic applications. The impedance spectroscopy data of the
entropy-stabilized samples reveal the presence of electronic contributions with
small activation energy (0.3-0.4 eV) across a temperature range of 298K-423K.
These observations in ES fluorite systems show potential for their
multifunctional applications via further optimization and confirm the great
chemical versatility of entropy-stabilized oxides.

derivatives of several BRDF models. In differentiable rendering, BRDFs are
replaced by their differential BRDF counterparts which are real-valued and can
have negative values. This leads to a new source of variance arising from their
change in sign. Real-valued functions cannot be perfectly importance sampled by
a positive-valued PDF and the direct application of BRDF sampling leads to high
variance. Previous attempts at antithetic sampling only addressed the
derivative with the roughness parameter of isotropic microfacet BRDFs. Our work
generalizes BRDF derivative sampling to anisotropic microfacet models, mixture
BRDFs, Oren-Nayar, Hanrahan-Krueger, among other analytic BRDFs.
  Our method first decomposes the real-valued differential BRDF into a sum of
single-signed functions, eliminating variance from a change in sign. Next, we
importance sample each of the resulting single-signed functions separately. The
first decomposition, positivization, partitions the real-valued function based
on its sign, and is effective at variance reduction when applicable. However,
it requires analytic knowledge of the roots of the differential BRDF, and for
it to be analytically integrable too. Our key insight is that the single-signed
functions can have overlapping support, which significantly broadens the ways
we can decompose a real-valued function. Our product and mixture decompositions
exploit this property, and they allow us to support several BRDF derivatives
that positivization could not handle. For a wide variety of BRDF derivatives,
our method significantly reduces the variance (up to 58x in some cases) at
equal computation cost and enables better recovery of spatially varying
textures through gradient-descent-based inverse rendering.

  We first consider the Jack measures on Young diagrams of arbitrary size,
which depend on the inverse temperature parameter $\beta>0$ and specialize to
Schur measures when $\beta=2$. We introduce a class of Jack measures of
Plancherel-type and prove a law of large numbers and central limit theorem in
the three regimes. In each regime, we provide explicit formulas for polynomial
observables of the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations around the limit
shape. These formulas have surprising positivity properties and are expressed
in terms of weighted lattice paths. We also establish connections between these
measures and the work of Kerov-Okounkov-Olshanski on Jack-positive
specializations and show that this is a rich class of measures parametrized by
the elements in the Thoma cone.
  Second, we show that the formulas from limits of Plancherel-type Jack
measures are universal: they also describe the limit shape and Gaussian
fluctuations for the second model of random Young diagrams of a fixed size
defined by Jack characters with the approximate factorization property (AFP)
studied by the second author and \'Sniady. Finally, we discuss the limit shape
in the high/low-temperature regimes and show that, contrary to the continuous
case of $\beta$-ensembles, there is a phase transition phenomenon in passing
from the fixed temperature regime to the high/low temperature regimes. We note
that the relation we find between the two different models of random Young

Schur measures to the character measures with the AFP studied by Biane and

to zero spontaneous polarization. Thereby we reveal an unusually strong effect

loops shape, dielectric susceptibility, and piezoelectric response of CIPS
films. In particular, by varying the sign of the mismatch strain and its
magnitude in a narrow range, quasi-static hysteresis-less paraelectric curves
can transform into double, triple, and other types of pinched and single
hysteresis loops. The strain effect on the polarization reversal is opposite,
i.e., ""anomalous"", in comparison with many other ferroelectric films in that
the out-of-plane remanent polarization and coercive field increases strongly
for tensile strains, meanwhile the polarization decreases or vanish for
compressive strains. We explain the effect by ""inverted"" signs of linear and
nonlinear electrostriction coupling coefficients of CIPS and their strong
temperature dependence. For definite values of temperature and mismatch strain,
the low-frequency hysteresis loops of polarization may exhibit negative slope
in the relatively narrow range of external field amplitude and frequency.

defects for different laser power-scan speed combinations and can be visualized
using a printability map. Constructing printability maps is typically a costly
process due to the involvement of experiments, which restricts their
application in high-throughput product design. To reduce the cost and effort of
constructing printability maps, a fully computational framework is introduced
in this work. The framework combines CALPHAD models and a reduced-order model
to predict material properties. THen, an analytical thermal model, known as the
Eagar-Tsai model, utilizes some of these materials' properties to calculate the
melt pool geometry during the AM processes. In the end, printability maps are
constructed using material properties, melt pool dimensions, and commonly used
criteria for lack of fusion, balling, and keyholing defects. To validate the
framework and its general application to laser powder-bed fusion alloys, five
common additive manufacturing alloys are analyzed. Furthermore, NiTi-based
alloys at three different compositions are evaluated to show the further
extension of the framework to alloy systems at different compositions. The
defect regions in these printability maps are validated with corresponding
experimental observations to compare and benchmark the defect criteria and find
the optimal criterion set with the maximum accuracy for each unique material
composition. Furthermore, printability maps for NiTi that are obtained from our
framework are used in conjunction with process maps resulting from a
multi-model framework to guide the fabrication of defect-free additive

becomes more prevalent, it is feasible to consider the generation of
computationally derived SI curves as a supplement or precursor to curves that
are experimentally derived. It is beneficial, therefore, to examine the
profiles of the SI curves produced by different cardiac tissue models to
determine whether some models capture the refractory period more accurately
than others. In this study, we compare the unipolar SI curves of two tissue
models: the current state-of-the-art bidomain model and the recently developed
extracellular-membrane-intracellular (EMI) model. The EMI model's resolution of
individual cell structure makes it a more detailed model than the bidomain
model, which forgoes the structure of individual cardiac cells in favour of
treating them homogeneously as a continuum. We find that the resulting SI
curves elucidate differences between the models, including that the behaviour
of the EMI model is noticeably closer to the refractory behaviour of

implications for future computational pacemaker simulations and shed light on

Efficient methods for sampling and closed form solutions for the marginal

characterization, it is shown that optimal solutions to soft-Dice can be
recovered by thresholding solutions to cross-entropy with a particular a priori

whether the decrease in performance seen when using cross-entropy as compared
to soft-Dice is caused by using the wrong threshold. The hypothesis is
validated in 5-fold studies on three organ segmentation problems from the
TotalSegmentor data set, using 4 different strengths of noise. The results show
that changing the threshold leads the performance of cross-entropy to go from

  Network Pruning","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.10079",,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Network pruning is a widely used technique to reduce computation cost and
model size for deep neural networks. However, the typical three-stage pipeline
significantly increases the overall training time. In this paper, we develop a
systematic weight-pruning optimization approach based on Surrogate Lagrangian
relaxation, which is tailored to overcome difficulties caused by the discrete
nature of the weight-pruning problem. We prove that our method ensures fast
convergence of the model compression problem, and the convergence of the SLR is
accelerated by using quadratic penalties. Model parameters obtained by SLR
during the training phase are much closer to their optimal values as compared
to those obtained by other state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate our method on
image classification tasks using CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with state-of-the-art
MLP-Mixer, Swin Transformer, and VGG-16, ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and ResNet-110,
MobileNetV2. We also evaluate object detection and segmentation tasks on COCO,
KITTI benchmark, and TuSimple lane detection dataset using a variety of models.
Experimental results demonstrate that our SLR-based weight-pruning optimization
approach achieves a higher compression rate than state-of-the-art methods under
the same accuracy requirement and also can achieve higher accuracy under the
same compression rate requirement. Under classification tasks, our SLR approach
converges to the desired accuracy $3\times$ faster on both of the datasets.
Under object detection and segmentation tasks, SLR also converges $2\times$
faster to the desired accuracy. Further, our SLR achieves high model accuracy
even at the hard-pruning stage without retraining, which reduces the
traditional three-stage pruning into a two-stage process. Given a limited
budget of retraining epochs, our approach quickly recovers the model's
accuracy.

of generic visual recognition, persists in a multitude of real-world
applications. To tackle the heavily-skewed dataset issue in long-tailed
classification, prior efforts have sought to augment existing deep models with
the elaborate class-balancing strategies, such as class rebalancing, data
augmentation, and module improvement. Despite the encouraging performance, the
limited class knowledge of the tailed classes in the training dataset still
bottlenecks the performance of the existing deep models. In this paper, we
propose an innovative long-tailed learning paradigm that breaks the bottleneck
by guiding the learning of deep networks with external prior knowledge. This is
specifically achieved by devising an elaborated ``prophetic'' teacher, termed
as ``Propheter'', that aims to learn the potential class distributions. The
target long-tailed prediction model is then optimized under the instruction of
the well-trained ``Propheter'', such that the distributions of different
classes are as distinguishable as possible from each other. Experiments on
eight long-tailed benchmarks across three architectures demonstrate that the
proposed prophetic paradigm acts as a promising solution to the challenge of
limited class knowledge in long-tailed datasets. Our code and model can be

samples is Determinantal Point Process (DPP). However, it suffers from a few
known drawbacks, such as restriction of the number of samples to the rank of
the similarity matrix, and not being customizable for specific learning tasks
(e.g., multi-level classification tasks). In this paper, we propose a new way
of measuring task-oriented diversity based on the Rate-Distortion (RD) theory,
appropriate for multi-level classification. To this end, we establish a
fundamental relationship between DPP and RD theory, which led to designing
RD-DPP, an RD-based value function to evaluate the diversity gain of data
samples. We also observe that the upper bound of the diversity of data selected
by DPP has a universal trend of phase transition that quickly approaches its
maximum point, then slowly converges to its final limits, meaning that DPP is
beneficial only at the beginning of sample accumulation. We use this fact to
design a bi-modal approach for sequential data selection.

switch predictions by only using different segmentation heads, and the latter
aims to learn a specific domain prediction while distilling the semantic
knowledge from other domains. The proposed SST has the following appealing
benefits: (1) it can capably serve as an effective training scheme to embed
semantic associations of human body parts from multiple label domains into the
human representation learning process; (2) it is an extensible semantic
transfer framework without predetermining the overall relations of multiple
label domains, which allows continuously adding human parsing datasets to
promote the training. (3) the relevant modules are only used for auxiliary
training and can be removed during inference, eliminating the extra reasoning
cost. Experimental results demonstrate SST can effectively achieve promising
universal human parsing performance as well as impressive improvements compared
to its counterparts on three human parsing benchmarks (i.e.,
PASCAL-Person-Part, ATR, and CIHP). Code is available at

Ic (SNe Ic-BL) even without an associated GRB. In the present work, we
investigate observational consequences in this scenario, focusing on the case
where the energy injection is sufficiently brief, which has been suggested for
GRB-SNe. We construct a simplified, spherical ejecta model sequence taking into
account the major effects of the central engine; composition mixing, density
structure, and the outermost ejecta velocity. Unlike most of the previous works
for GRB-SNe, we solve the formation of the photosphere self-consistently, with
which we can predict the photometric and spectroscopic observables. We find
that these ejecta properties strongly affect their observational appearance in
the initial phase (~ a week since the explosion), highlighted by blended lines
suffering from higher-velocity absorptions for the flatter density distribution
and/or higher outermost ejeca velocity. This behaviour also affects the
multi-band light curves in a non-monotonic way. Prompt follow-up observations
starting immediately after the explosion thus provides key diagnostics to
unveil the nature of the central engine behind GRB-SNe and SNe Ic-BL. For SN
2017iuk associated with GRB 171205A these diagnosing observational data are

us to propose a two-stage federated learning approach toward the objective of

cluster centers obtained from the clients are clustered at the server for
training the global model. Despite PNN being a one-pass learning classifier,
its complexity depends on the training data size. Therefore, we employed a
modified evolving clustering method (ECM), another one-pass algorithm to
cluster the training data thereby increasing the speed further. Moreover, we
conducted sensitivity analysis by varying Dthr, a hyperparameter of ECM at the

fairness concerns. Importance reweighting is a classical and effective way to
handle the subpopulation shift. However, recent studies have recognized that
most of these approaches fail to improve the performance especially when
applied to over-parameterized neural networks which are capable of fitting any

called reweighted mixup (RMIX), to mitigate the overfitting issue in
over-parameterized models by conducting importance weighting on the ''mixed''

to explore the vicinal space of minority samples more, thereby obtaining more
robust model against subpopulation shift. When the subpopulation memberships
are unknown, the training-trajectories-based uncertainty estimation is equipped
in the proposed RMIX to flexibly characterize the subpopulation distribution.
We also provide insightful theoretical analysis to verify that RMIX achieves
better generalization bounds over prior works. Further, we conduct extensive
empirical studies across a wide range of tasks to validate the effectiveness of

experience. The timestamp of the POI to be predicted is of great significance,
since a user will go to different places at different times. However, most
existing methods either do not use this kind of temporal information, or just
implicitly fuse it with other contextual information. In this paper, we revisit
the problem of location recommendation and point out that explicitly modeling
temporal information is a great help when the model needs to predict not only
the next location but also further locations. In addition, state-of-the-art
methods do not make effective use of geographic information and suffer from the
hard boundary problem when encoding geographic information by gridding. To this
end, a Temporal Prompt-based and Geography-aware (TPG) framework is proposed.
The temporal prompt is firstly designed to incorporate temporal information of
any further check-in. A shifted window mechanism is then devised to augment
geographic data for addressing the hard boundary problem. Via extensive
comparisons with existing methods and ablation studies on five real-world
datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed
method under various settings. Most importantly, our proposed model has the
superior ability of interval prediction. In particular, the model can predict
the location that a user wants to go to at a certain time while the most recent
check-in behavioral data is masked, or it can predict specific future check-in

usually results in catastrophic forgetting of neural networks. Although it can
be alleviated by repeatedly replaying buffered data, the every-step replay is
time-consuming. In this paper, we study which modules in neural networks are
more prone to forgetting by investigating their training dynamics during CL.
Our proposed metrics show that only a few modules are more task-specific and
sensitively alter between tasks, while others can be shared across tasks as
common knowledge. Hence, we attribute forgetting mainly to the former and find
that finetuning them only on a small buffer at the end of any CL method can
bring non-trivial improvement. Due to the small number of finetuned parameters,
such ``Forgetting Prioritized Finetuning (FPF)'' is efficient in computation.
We further propose a more efficient and simpler method that entirely removes
the every-step replay and replaces them by only $k$-times of FPF periodically
triggered during CL. Surprisingly, this ``$k$-FPF'' performs comparably to FPF
and outperforms the SOTA CL methods but significantly reduces their
computational overhead and cost. In experiments on several benchmarks of class-
and domain-incremental CL, FPF consistently improves existing CL methods by a
large margin, and $k$-FPF further excels in efficiency without degrading the
accuracy. We also empirically studied the impact of buffer size, epochs per
task, and finetuning modules on the cost and accuracy of our methods.

one-dimensional photonic crystal Fabry-Perot cavity. OB stems from the third
order nonlinear conductivity of 3D DSM and the local field of resonance mode
could enhance the nonlinearity and reduce the thresholds of OB. This structure
achieves the tunability of OB due to that the transmittance could be modulated
by the Fermi energy. OB threshold and threshold width could be remarkably
reduced by increasing the Fermi energy. Besides, it is found that the OB curve
depends heavily on the angle of incidence of the incoming light, the structural
parameters of the Fabry-Perot cavity, and the position of 3D DSM inside the
cavity. After parameter optimization, we obtained OB with a threshold of 106
V/m. We believe this simple structure provides a reference idea for realizing
low threshold and tunable all optical switching devices. Keywords: Optical
bistability, Dirac semimetal, Fabry-Perot cavity.

a machine learning model without sharing raw data with each other. However, it
suffers the leakage of private information from uploading models. In addition,
as the model size grows, the training latency increases due to limited

differential privacy (DP) protection. In this paper, we propose a gradient
sparsification empowered FL framework over wireless channels, in order to
improve training efficiency without sacrificing convergence performance.
Specifically, we first design a random sparsification algorithm to retain a
fraction of the gradient elements in each client's local training, thereby
mitigating the performance degradation induced by DP and and reducing the
number of transmission parameters over wireless channels. Then, we analyze the
convergence bound of the proposed algorithm, by modeling a non-convex FL

for minimizing the developed convergence bound, under the constraints of

argue that hard optimization problems could be tackled efficiently by making
better use of experiences gained in related problems. We demonstrate our ideas
in the context of expensive optimization, where we aim to find a near-optimal

of expensive problems, where experiences are gained across related expensive

task-independent parameters of a deep kernel learning surrogate, then the
solutions sampled from the target task are used to adapt task-specific
parameters for the surrogate. With the help of experience learning, competitive
regression-based surrogates can be initialized using only 1$d$ solutions from
the target task ($d$ is the dimension of the decision space). Our experimental
results on expensive multi-objective and constrained optimization problems

Architecture Search (NAS) has the potential to solve this problem by automating
GNN architecture designs. Nevertheless, current graph NAS approaches lack
robust design and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To tackle these

us to search for defensive GNNs. Furthermore, we define a robustness metric to
guide the search procedure, which helps to filter robust architectures. In this
way, G-RNA helps understand GNN robustness from an architectural perspective

index-retrieve paradigm. It is challenging to optimize pipelines based on this
paradigm in an end-to-end manner. As an alternative, generative retrieval
represents documents as identifiers (docid) and retrieves documents by
generating docids, enabling end-to-end modeling of document retrieval tasks.
However, it is an open question how one should define the document identifiers.
Current approaches to the task of defining document identifiers rely on fixed
rule-based docids, such as the title of a document or the result of clustering
BERT embeddings, which often fail to capture the complete semantic information
of a document. We propose GenRet, a document tokenization learning method to
address the challenge of defining document identifiers for generative
retrieval. GenRet learns to tokenize documents into short discrete
representations (i.e., docids) via a discrete auto-encoding approach. Three
components are included in GenRet: (i) a tokenization model that produces
docids for documents; (ii) a reconstruction model that learns to reconstruct a
document based on a docid; and (iii) a sequence-to-sequence retrieval model
that generates relevant document identifiers directly for a designated query.
By using an auto-encoding framework, GenRet learns semantic docids in a fully
end-to-end manner. We also develop a progressive training scheme to capture the
autoregressive nature of docids and to stabilize training. We conduct
experiments on the NQ320K, MS MARCO, and BEIR datasets to assess the
effectiveness of GenRet. GenRet establishes the new state-of-the-art on the
NQ320K dataset. Especially, compared to generative retrieval baselines, GenRet
can achieve significant improvements on the unseen documents. GenRet also

information to model the truthfulness of news. However, the discourse of online
fake news is typically subtle and it requires expert knowledge to use textual
information to debunk fake news. Recently, studies focusing on multimodal fake
news detection have outperformed text-only methods. Recent approaches utilizing
the pre-trained model to extract unimodal features, or fine-tuning the
pre-trained model directly, have become a new paradigm for detecting fake news.
Again, this paradigm either requires a large number of training instances, or
updates the entire set of pre-trained model parameters, making real-world fake
news detection impractical. Furthermore, traditional multimodal methods fuse
the cross-modal features directly without considering that the uncorrelated
semantic representation might inject noise into the multimodal features. This
paper proposes a Similarity-Aware Multimodal Prompt Learning (SAMPLE)
framework. First, we incorporate prompt learning into multimodal fake news
detection. Prompt learning, which only tunes prompts with a frozen language
model, can reduce memory usage significantly and achieve comparable
performances, compared with fine-tuning. We analyse three prompt templates with
a soft verbalizer to detect fake news. In addition, we introduce the
similarity-aware fusing method to adaptively fuse the intensity of multimodal
representation and mitigate the noise injection via uncorrelated cross-modal
features. For evaluation, SAMPLE surpasses the F1 and the accuracies of
previous works on two benchmark multimodal datasets, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting fake news. In addition,
SAMPLE also is superior to other approaches regardless of few-shot and

While reducing the size of the MLPs and employing efficient parametric encoding

super-resolution. In this paper, we introduce HyperINR, a novel hypernetwork
architecture capable of directly predicting the weights for a compact INR. By
harnessing an ensemble of multiresolution hash encoding units in unison, the
resulting INR attains state-of-the-art inference performance (up to 100x higher

exceptional data and visualization generation quality is achieved, making our
method valuable for real-time parameter exploration. We validate the
effectiveness of the HyperINR architecture through a comprehensive ablation

To dig more diverse modality-shared cues, we expect that erasing

model to extract more and other modality-shared features for identification. To
this end, we propose shape-erased feature learning paradigm that decorrelates
modality-shared features in two orthogonal subspaces. Jointly learning
shape-related feature in one subspace and shape-erased features in the

agents to move in the same direction. We utilize two methods to incorporate the
highway idea into the lifelong MAPF framework and discuss the properties that
minimize the existing problems of deadlocks and rerouting. The experimental
results demonstrate that the runtime is considerably reduced and the decay of
throughput is gradually insignificant as the map size enlarges under the

phenomena of deadlocks and rerouting are significantly reduced by leveraging

to alleviate the data sparsity issue in recommender systems by utilizing
different domain information. In this work, we focus on the more general
Non-overlapping Cross-domain Sequential Recommendation (NCSR) scenario. NCSR is
challenging because there are no overlapped entities (e.g., users and items)
between domains, and there is only users' implicit feedback and no content
information. Previous CR methods cannot solve NCSR well, since (1) they either
need extra content to align domains or need explicit domain alignment
constraints to reduce the domain discrepancy from domain-invariant features,
(2) they pay more attention to users' explicit feedback (i.e., users' rating
data) and cannot well capture their sequential interaction patterns, (3) they
usually do a single-target cross-domain recommendation task and seldom
investigate the dual-target ones. Considering the above challenges, we propose
Prompt Learning-based Cross-domain Recommender (PLCR), an automated
prompting-based recommendation framework for the NCSR task. Specifically, to
address the challenge (1), PLCR resorts to learning domain-invariant and
domain-specific representations via its prompt learning component, where the
domain alignment constraint is discarded. For challenges (2) and (3), PLCR
introduces a pre-trained sequence encoder to learn users' sequential
interaction patterns, and conducts a dual-learning target with a separation

that the system is immersed in non-Markovian squeezed baths. For the dynamics,
a non-Markovian master eqation is obtained using the quantum state diffusion
(QSD) equation technique for the weak system-bath couplings. We use the
adiabatic evolution or quantum state transmission as examples to analyze the
effects of the bath parameters: non-Markovianity $\gamma$, the squeezed
direction $\theta$ and squeezed strength $r$. For the adiabatic or state
transmission fidelity, the calculation results show that they both can be
enhanced by a smaller $\gamma$ or bigger $p$-quadrature. Interestingly, when
$0<\theta<\pi/2$, the squeezed quadrature is determined by the combination of
$r$ and $\theta$, and by numerical simulation we find that the fidelity peak
occurs at $r=1-2\theta/\pi$. The fidelities increase with increasing $r$ when
$r\in (0,1-2\theta/\pi]$. When $\theta\ge\pi/2$, lower fidelities are obtained

symmetry breaking are believed to exhibit a half-quantized Hall conductance.
However, such scenarios are obviously inconsistent with the
Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-Nijs theorem, which states that a single band in a
lattice with a finite Brillouin zone can only have an integer-quantized Hall
conductance. To explore this, we investigate the band structures of a lattice
model describing the magnetic topological insulator film that supports the
axion insulator, Chern insulator, and semi-magnetic topological insulator
phases. We reveal that the gapped and gapless surface bands in the three phases
are characterized by an integer-quantized Hall conductance and a half-quantized
Hall conductance, respectively. This result is distinct from the previous
consensus that the gapped surface band is responsible for the half-quantized
Hall conductance and the gapless band should exhibit zero Hall response. We
propose an effective model to describe the three phases and show that the
low-energy dispersion of the surface bands inherits from the surface Dirac
fermions. The gapped surface band manifests a nearly half-quantized Hall
conductance at low energy near the center of Brillouin zone, but is compensated
by another nearly half-quantized Hall conductance at high energy near the
boundary of Brillouin zone because a single band can only have an
integer-quantized Hall conductance. The gapless state hosts a zero Hall
conductance at low energy but is compensated by another half-quantized Hall
conductance at high energy, and thus the half-quantized Hall conductance can
only originate from the gapless band. Moreover, we calculate the layer-resolved
Hall conductance of the system. The conclusion suggests that the individual
gapped surface band alone does not support the half-quantized surface Hall
effect in a lattice model.

several times to improve the probability of successful delivery. Using tools
from stochastic geometry and queueing theory, we develop a novel spatiotemporal
framework to determine the number of fragments and repetitions needed to
optimize the network performance in terms of transmission reliability and
latency. To this end, the proposed OLRA is bench-marked against conventional
closed-loop rate adaptation (CLRA) to highlight the impact of feedback in

Vision Transformer (ViT), which enables adaptive feature extraction from global

In contrast, local attention, which restricts the receptive field of each query
to its own neighboring pixels, enjoys the benefits of both convolution and
self-attention, namely local inductive bias and dynamic feature selection.
Nevertheless, current local attention modules either use inefficient Im2Col
function or rely on specific CUDA kernels that are hard to generalize to
devices without CUDA support. In this paper, we propose a novel local attention
module, Slide Attention, which leverages common convolution operations to
achieve high efficiency, flexibility and generalizability. Specifically, we

features in the local region. In this way, our module realizes the local
attention paradigm in both efficient and flexible manner. Extensive experiments
show that our slide attention module is applicable to a variety of advanced

respectively, the maximum chromatic number and the maximum list chromatic
number of $H$-minor-free graphs. Hadwiger's famous coloring conjecture from
1943 states that $f_\chi(K_t)=t-1$ for every $t \ge 2$. In contrast, for list
coloring it is known that $2t-o(t) \le f_\ell(K_t) \le O(t (\log \log t)^6)$
and thus, $f_\ell(K_t)$ is bounded away from the conjectured value $t-1$ for
$f_\chi(K_t)$ by at least a constant factor. The so-called $H$-Hadwiger's
conjecture, proposed by Seymour, asks to prove that $f_\chi(H)=\textsf{v}(H)-1$
for a given graph $H$ (which would be implied by Hadwiger's conjecture). In
this paper, we prove several new lower bounds on $f_\ell(H)$, thus exploring
the limits of a list coloring extension of $H$-Hadwiger's conjecture. Our main
results are:
  For every $\varepsilon>0$ and all sufficiently large graphs $H$ we have
$f_\ell(H)\ge (1-\varepsilon)(\textsf{v}(H)+\kappa(H))$, where $\kappa(H)$
denotes the vertex-connectivity of $H$.
  For every $\varepsilon>0$ there exists $C=C(\varepsilon)>0$ such that
asymptotically almost every $n$-vertex graph $H$ with $\left\lceil C n\log
n\right\rceil$ edges satisfies $f_\ell(H)\ge (2-\varepsilon)n$.
  The first result generalizes recent results on complete and complete
bipartite graphs and shows that the list chromatic number of $H$-minor-free
graphs is separated from the natural lower bound $(\textsf{v}(H)-1)$ by a
constant factor for all large graphs $H$ of linear connectivity. The second
result tells us that even when $H$ is a very sparse graph (with an average
degree just logarithmic in its order), $f_\ell(H)$ can still be separated from
$(\textsf{v}(H)-1)$ by a constant factor arbitrarily close to $2$. Conceptually
these results indicate that the graphs $H$ for which $f_\ell(H)$ is close to
$(\textsf{v}(H)-1)$ are typically rather sparse.

object detection by proposing a curricular object manipulation (COM) framework.
The framework embeds the curricular training strategy into both the loss design
and the augmentation process. For the loss design, we propose the COMLoss to
dynamically predict object-level difficulties and emphasize objects of
different difficulties based on training stages. On top of the widely-used
augmentation technique called GT-Aug in LiDAR detection tasks, we propose a
novel COMAug strategy which first clusters objects in ground-truth database
based on well-designed heuristics. Group-level difficulties rather than
individual ones are then predicted and updated during training for stable
results. Model performance and generalization capabilities can be improved by
sampling and augmenting progressively more difficult objects into the training
samples. Extensive experiments and ablation studies reveal the superior and
generality of the proposed framework. The code is available at

  missing observations",,,,,"math.ST stat.AP stat.ME stat.OT stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the geosciences, a recurring problem is one of estimating spatial means of
a physical field using weighted averages of point observations. An important
variant is when individual observations are counted with some probability less
than one. This can occur in different contexts: from missing data to estimating
the statistics across subsamples. In such situations, the spatial mean is a
ratio of random variables, whose statistics involve approximate estimators
derived through series expansion. The present paper considers truncated
estimators of variance of the spatial mean and their general structure in the
presence of missing data. To all orders, the variance estimator depends only on
the first and second moments of the underlying field, and convergence requires
these moments to be finite. Furthermore, convergence occurs if either the
probability of counting individual observations is larger than 1/2 or the
number of point observations is large. In case the point observations are
weighted uniformly, the estimators are easily found using combinatorics and
involve Stirling numbers of the second kind.

representations from interaction data. These methods, while performant, do not
provide ready mechanisms for users to control the recommendation they receive.
Our work tackles this problem by proposing LACE, a novel concept value
bottleneck model for controllable text recommendations. LACE represents each
user with a succinct set of human-readable concepts through retrieval given
user-interacted documents and learns personalized representations of the
concepts based on user documents. This concept based user profile is then
leveraged to make recommendations. The design of our model affords control over
the recommendations through a number of intuitive interactions with a
transparent user profile. We first establish the quality of recommendations
obtained from LACE in an offline evaluation on three recommendation tasks
spanning six datasets in warm-start, cold-start, and zero-shot setups. Next, we
validate the controllability of LACE under simulated user interactions.
Finally, we implement LACE in an interactive controllable recommender system
and conduct a user study to demonstrate that users are able to improve the
quality of recommendations they receive through interactions with an editable
user profile.

a new ideal scenario is defined as a reference for the atmospheric aerosol

categories: those that target the data traffic on a network and those that
target the control traffic. This article explains the many sorts of assaults,
their impact on MANET, and the MANET-based defence measures that are currently
in place. The suggested SRA that employs blockchain technology (SRABC) protects
MANET from attacks and authenticates nodes. The secure routing algorithm (SRA)
proposed by blockchain technology safeguards control and data flow against

observation of a common red noise process in pulsar-timing data suggests that
the first credible detection of nanohertz-frequency gravitational waves could
take place within the next few years. The detection process is complicated by
the nature of the signals and the noise: the first observational claims will be
statistical inferences drawn at the threshold of detectability. To demonstrate
that gravitational waves are creating some of the noise in the pulsar-timing
data sets, observations must exhibit the Hellings and Downs curve -- the
angular correlation function associated with gravitational waves -- as well as
demonstrating that there are no other reasonable explanations. To ensure that
detection claims are credible, the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) has
a formal process to vet results prior to publication. This includes internal
sharing of data and processing pipelines between different PTAs, enabling
independent cross-checks and validation of results. To oversee and validate any
detection claim, the IPTA has also created an eight-member Detection Committee
(DC) which includes four independent external members. IPTA members will only
publish their results after a formal review process has concluded. This
document is the initial DC checklist, describing some of the conditions that
should be fulfilled by a credible detection. At the present time none of the
PTAs have a detection claim; therefore this document serves as a road map for
the future.

  into three stages coupled with maturation delay owing to juvenile hunting",,,,,"math.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The predator-prey dynamic appertaining to two species is explored, wherein
the predator species is structured into different stages. As evidenced from
natural documentation, the immature predators possess the potential to predate
albeit not as competently as the adults. Nevertheless, this potentiality is not
acquired immediately after their incipience of life, hence, the immature stage
is branched off into the infant stage, the stage with extensive reliance on the
adults, and the juvenile stage, the stage with the potential to predate but not
to procreate. In this paper, this inaugural concept is coupled with injuries in
the juvenile stage as the repercussion of their incompetency in predating,
thereby ensuing a delay in their maturation. With the incentive to investigate
the ascendancy of these refinements over the whole system, stability analyses
along with various bifurcation analyses around the equilibrium points of the
system are corroborated. In addition to Hopf, transcritical, and saddle node
bifurcations, the existence of Bogdanov-Takens point, cusp point, Bautin
bifurcation point, bloom phenomenon, twice occurring Hopf bifurcation, and
bi-stability phenomenon make the paper appreciably more rich and efficacious.

presently dominating the electric automotive sector. Energy research efforts
are also focussed on accurate computation of State-of-Charge of such batteries

algorithms provide precise estimates, all such techniques available in

reality, gaining access to proprietary battery usage datasets is very tough for
battery scientists. Moreover, open access datasets lack the diverse battery
charge/discharge patterns needed to build generalized models. Curating battery

  Public Transit- A Case Study in the City of Charlotte, NC","22 pages, 54 figures",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Access to adequate public transportation plays a critical role in inequity
and socio-economic mobility, particularly in low-income communities. Low-income
workers who rely heavily on public transportation face a spatial disparity
between home and work, which leads to higher unemployment, longer job searches,
and longer commute times. The overarching goal of this study is to get initial
data that would result in creating a connected, coordinated, demand-responsive,
and efficient public bus system that minimizes transit gaps for low-income,
transit-dependent communities. To create equitable metropolitan public
transportation, this paper evaluates existing CATS mobile applications that
assist passengers in finding bus routes and arrival times. Our community survey
methodology includes filling out questionnaires on Charlotte's current bus
system on specific bus lines and determining user acceptance for a future novel
smart technology. We have also collected data on the demand and transit gap for
a real-world pilot study, Sprinter bus line, Bus line 7, Bus line 9, and Bus
lines 97-99. These lines connect all of Charlotte City's main areas and are the
most important bus lines in the system. On the studied routes, the primary
survey results indicate that the current bus system has many flaws, the major
one being the lack of proper timing to meet the needs of passengers. The most
common problems are long commutes and long waiting times at stations. Moreover,
the existing application provides inaccurate information, and on average, 80
percent of travelers and respondents are inclined to use new technology.

  Abstract abridged. Living document, will be updated when necessary",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Very long baseline radio interferometry (VLBI) with ground-based
observatories is limited by the size of Earth, the geographic distribution of
antennas, and the transparency of the atmosphere. In this whitepaper, we
present Capella, a tentative design of a space-only VLBI system. Using four
small (<500 kg) satellites in two orthogonal polar low-Earth orbit planes, and
single-band heterodyne receivers operating at frequencies around 690 GHz, the
interferometer is able to achieve angular resolutions of approximately 7
microarcsec. Within a total observing time of three days, a near-complete uv
plane coverage can be reached. All key components required for Capella - radio
telescope, receiver, sampler, recorder, atomic frequency standard, positioning
system, data downlink, and pointing control system - are already available,
some of them off-the-shelf; the science payload of each satellite has a mass of
about 200 kg and consumes about 550 W of power. The data from the telescopes
can be correlated on the ground using dedicated versions of existing Fourier
transform (FX) software correlators; in addition to the steps required by VLBI
data correlation and calibration in general, dedicated routines will be needed
to handle the effects of orbital motion, including relativistic corrections.
With the specifications assumed in this whitepaper, Capella will be able to
address a range of science cases, including: photon rings around supermassive
black holes; the acceleration and collimation zones of plasma jets emitted from
the vicinity of supermassive black holes; the chemical composition of accretion
flows into active galactic nuclei through observations of molecular absorption
lines; mapping supermassive binary black holes; the magnetic activity of stars;
and nova eruptions of symbiotic binary stars - and, like any substantially new
observing technique, has the potential for unexpected discoveries.

a novel task, named Deep Personalized Character Creation (DPCC): creating
multimodal chat personalized characters from multimodal data such as TV shows.
Specifically, given a single- or multi-modality input (text, audio, video), the
goal of DPCC is to generate a multi-modality (text, audio, video) response,
which should be well-matched the personality of a specific character such as
Sheldon, and of high quality as well. To support this novel task, we further
collect a character centric multimodal dialogue dataset, named Deep
Personalized Character Dataset (DPCD), from TV shows. DPCD contains
character-specific multimodal dialogue data of ~10k utterances and ~6 hours of
audio/video per character, which is around 10 times larger compared to existing
related datasets.On DPCD, we present a baseline method for the DPCC task and
create 5 Deep personalized digital Characters (DeepCharacters) from Big Bang TV
Shows. We conduct both subjective and objective experiments to evaluate the
multimodal response from DeepCharacters in terms of characterization and
quality. The results demonstrates that, on our collected DPCD dataset, the
proposed baseline can create personalized digital characters for generating
multimodal response.Our collected DPCD dataset, the code of data collection and

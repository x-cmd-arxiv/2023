and uniqueness for a semilinear fourth-order boundary value problem in the ball
of $\mathbb R^2$ deriving from the Kirchhoff-Love model of deformations of thin
plates. We first show the radial monotonicity for a wide class of biharmonic
problems. The proof of uniqueness is based on ODE techniques and applies to the
whole range of the boundary parameter. For an unbounded subset of this range we
also prove symmetry of the ground states by means of a rearrangement argument
which makes use of Talenti's comparison principle. This paper complements the
analysis in [G. Romani, Anal. PDE 10 (2017), no. 4, 943-982], where existence

between the Jovian magnetic field with co-rotating iogenic plasma and the
Galilean moons. The disturbances created near the moons propagate as Alfv\'en
waves along the magnetic field lines. The position of the moons is therefore
""Alfv\'enically"" connected to their respective auroral footprint. The angular
separation from the instantaneous magnetic footprint can be estimated by the
so-called lead angle. That lead angle varies periodically as a function of
orbital longitude, since the time for the Alfv\'en waves to reach the Jovian
ionosphere varies accordingly. Using spectral images of the Main Alfv\'en Wing
auroral spots collected by Juno-UVS during the first forty-three orbits, this
work provides the first empirical model of the Io, Europa and Ganymede
equatorial lead angles for the northern and southern hemispheres. Alfv\'en
travel times between the three innermost Galilean moons to Jupiter's northern

also demonstrate the accuracy of the mapping from the Juno magnetic field

Making the appropriate and sufficient decisions requires knowing what
situations the threat has engendered or may engender. In this paper, we propose
a quantitative risk-based method called QR-SACP to calculate and project
situational awareness in a network based on threat information sharing. In this
method, we investigate a threat from different aspects and evaluate the
threat's effects through dependency weight among a network's services. We
calculate the definite effect of a threat on a service and the cascading
propagation of the threat's definite effect on other dependent services to that
service. In addition, we project the probability of a threat propagation or
recurrence of the threat in other network services in three ways: procedurally,
network connections and similar infrastructure or services. Experimental
results demonstrate that the QR-SACP method can calculate and project definite
and probable threats' effects across the entire network and reveal more details

so-called particle swarm optimisation (PSO) approaches have proven to be highly
effective in a number of application areas. Given the maturity of the PSO
field, it is likely that novel variants of the PSO algorithm stand to offer
only marginal gains in terms of performance -- there is, after all, no free

functions, it is argued herein that research effort is better placed in the
pursuit of algorithms that also have other useful properties. In this work, a
highly-general, interpretable variant of the PSO algorithm -- particle
attractor algorithm (PAO) -- is proposed. Furthermore, the algorithm is
designed such that the transition densities (describing the motions of the

identify a paraelastic phase and three ferroelastic phases and study their

monolayer is a trivial insulator due to the orbital-ordering-induced band
inversion occurring between states with the same parity. Substituting one Bi
atom per cell with another V-group element (N, P, As) or applying an electric

the paraelastic InBi monolayer can be driven into the topological insulator

obtained by gently straining the paraelastic phase, also possesses such
topological insulating properties. These results provide several experimentally
accessible routes to tune the nontrivial topology in the InBi monolayer,

We also aim to estimate the location and size of a stability region inside the

semi-major axis, eccentricities, and inclinations that covers the region
interior to the orbit of Gamma, including the proposed orbit of Delta and a
wide region around it. We considered three different models for the
gravitational potential of Alpha: irregular polyhedron, ellipsoidal body and
oblate body. For a second scenario, Delta was considered a massive spherical
body and Alpha an irregular polyhedron. Beta and Gamma were assumed as
spherical massive bodies in both scenarios. The simulations showed that a large

an oblate body. For the scenario with Delta as a massive body, the results did
not change from those as massless particles. Beta and Gamma do not play any
relevant role in the dynamics of particles interior to the orbit of Gamma.
Delta's predicted orbital elements are fully unstable and far from the nearest
stable region. The primary instability source is Alpha's elongated shape.
Therefore, in the determination of the orbital elements of Delta, it must be
taken into account the gravitational potential of Alpha assuming, at least, an

(dimers). The dynamics of the excited states of these dimers has been studied
in detail. It is shown that the change in the lifetime of the given adiabatic
term of the diatomic quasi-molecule induced by the change in the interatomic
distance as well as possible non-adiabatic transitions between sub- and
superradiant states caused by atomic motion can lead not to the anticipated
weakening of subradiation effect but to its enhancement.

propagation in social networks called PA-IC model. In PA-IC, a popular item and
a novice item grab shares of popularity from the natural popularity growth via
the PA model, while the novice item tries to gain extra popularity via
influence cascade in a social network. The {\em popularity ratio} is defined as
the ratio of the popularity measure between the novice item and the popular
item. We formulate {\em Popularity Ratio Maximization (PRM)} as the problem of
selecting seeds in multiple rounds to maximize the popularity ratio in the end.
We analyze the popularity ratio and show that it is monotone but not
submodular. To provide an effective solution, we devise a surrogate objective
function and show that empirically it is very close to the original objective
function while theoretically, it is monotone and submodular. We design two
efficient algorithms, one for the overlapping influence and non-overlapping
seeds (across rounds) setting and the other for the non-overlapping influence
and overlapping seed setting, and further discuss how to deal with other models

proposed PRM-IMM method consistently achieves the best popularity promotion

geographical component. Currently, many countries have built geo-information

extensive construction of infrastructure and rapid expansion of cities,
automatic updating of road data is imperative to maintain the high quality of
current basic geographic information. However, obtaining bi-phase images for
the same area is difficult, and complex post-processing methods are required to
update the existing databases.To solve these problems, we proposed a road
detection method based on semi-supervised learning (SRUNet) specifically for
road-updating applications; in this approach, historical road information was
fused with the latest images to directly obtain the latest state of the
road.Considering that the texture of a road is complex, a multi-branch network,
named the Map Encoding Branch (MEB) was proposed for representation learning,
where the Boundary Enhancement Module (BEM) was used to improve the accuracy of
boundary prediction, and the Residual Refinement Module (RRM) was used to
optimize the prediction results. Further, to fully utilize the limited amount
of label information and to enhance the prediction accuracy on unlabeled
images, we utilized the mean teacher framework as the basic semi-supervised
learning framework and introduced Regional Contrast (ReCo) in our work to
improve the model capacity for distinguishing between the characteristics of
roads and background elements.We applied our method to two datasets. Our model
can effectively improve the performance of a model with fewer labels. Overall,
the proposed SRUNet can provide stable, up-to-date, and reliable prediction
results for a wide range of road renewal tasks.

investigation of electronic scattering dynamics in itinerant ferromagnets at
the level of Boltzmann scattering integrals for the magnon distributions and
spin-dependent electron distributions. In addition to electron-magnon
scattering, we include spin-conserving and effective Elliott-Yafet like

In our model system, the creation or annihilation of magnons leads to
transitions between two spin-split electronic bands with energy and momentum
conservation. Due to the presence of spin-orbit coupling, Coulomb scattering
transitions between these bands are also possible, and we describe them on an
equal footing in terms of Boltzmann scattering integrals. For an instantaneous
carrier excitation process we analyze the influence of both interaction
processes on the magnon and spin-dependent electron dynamics, and show that
their interplay gives rise to an efficient creation of magnons at higher

For example, it satisfies several improved manipulation-proof properties. Since
the $3$-wise Kemeny problem is NP-hard, our results also provide some of the

approach will be useful in a regime where quantum error correction (QEC) is
implementable but the number of qubits available for QEC is limited. Apart from
illustrating the utility of a traditional ZNE approach (circuit-level unitary
folding) for the QEC regime, we propose a novel noise scaling ZNE method
specifically tailored to QEC: \emph{distance scaled ZNE (DS-ZNE)}. DS-ZNE
scales the distance of the error correction code, and thereby the resulting
logical error rate, and utilizes this code distance as the scaling `knob' for
ZNE. Logical qubit error rates are scaled until the maximum achievable code
distance for a fixed number of physical qubits, and lower error rates (i.e.,
effectively higher code distances) are achieved via extrapolation techniques
migrated from traditional ZNE. Furthermore, to maximize physical qubit
utilization over the ZNE experiments, logical executions at code distances
lower than the maximum allowed by the physical qubits on the quantum device are
parallelized to optimize device utilization. We validate our proposal with
numerical simulation and confirm that ZNE lowers the logical error rates and
increases the effective code distance beyond the physical capability of the
quantum device. For instance, at a physical code distance of 11, the DS-ZNE
effective code distance is 17, and at a physical code distance of 13, the
DS-ZNE effective code distance is 21. When the proposed technique is compared
against unitary folding ZNE under the constraint of a fixed number of
executions of the quantum device, DS-ZNE outperforms unitary folding by up to

KL-style gap-dependent regret bound. We show that KL-MS enjoys the asymptotic
optimality when the rewards are Bernoulli and has a worst-case regret bound of

(RSE), which naturally generalizes the widely adopted solution concept of the
strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE). The RSE accounts for any possible
up-to-$\delta$ suboptimal follower responses in Stackelberg games and is
adopted to improve the robustness of the leader's strategy. While a few
variants of robust Stackelberg equilibrium have been considered in previous
literature, the RSE solution concept we consider is importantly different -- in
some sense, it relaxes previously studied robust Stackelberg strategies and is
applicable to much broader sources of uncertainties.
  We provide a thorough investigation of several fundamental properties of RSE,
including its utility guarantees, algorithmics, and learnability. We first show
that the RSE we defined always exists and thus is well-defined. Then we
characterize how the leader's utility in RSE changes with the robustness level
considered. On the algorithmic side, we show that, in sharp contrast to the
tractability of computing an SSE, it is NP-hard to obtain a fully polynomial
approximation scheme (FPTAS) for any constant robustness level. Nevertheless,
we develop a quasi-polynomial approximation scheme (QPTAS) for RSE. Finally, we
examine the learnability of the RSE in a natural learning scenario, where both
players' utilities are not known in advance, and provide almost tight sample
complexity results on learning the RSE. As a corollary of this result, we also
obtain an algorithm for learning SSE, which strictly improves a key result of
Bai et al. in terms of both utility guarantee and computational efficiency.

techniques converge slower than full tuning in low data scenarios, and posit
the amount of data required for PEFT methods to both perform well and converge
efficiently. Lastly, we further optimize these PEFT techniques by selectively
choosing which parts of the model to train, and find that these techniques can
be applied with significantly fewer parameters while maintaining and even

spectroscopy (AES) beyond the ultra-short core-hole relaxation time

one-dimensional Mott insulator represented by a half-filled Hubbard chain. The
Auger spectrum is usually calculated by assuming that, after the creation of a
core-hole, the system thermalizes almost instantaneously. This leads to a
relatively simple analytical expression that uses the ground-state with a
core-hole as a reference state and ignores all the transient dynamics related
to the screening of the core-hole. In this picture, the response of the system
can be associated to the pair spectral function. On the other hand, in our
numerical calculations, the core hole is created by a light pulse, allowing one
to study the transient dynamics of the system in terms of the pulse duration
and in the non-perturbative regime. Time-dependent density matrix
renormalization group calculations reveal that the relaxation process involves
the creation of a polarization cloud of doublon excitations that have an effect
similar to photo-doping. As a consequence, there is a leak of spectral weight
to higher energies into what otherwise would be the Mott gap. For longer
pulses, these excited states, mostly comprised of doublons, can dominate the
spectrum. By changing the duration of the light-pulse, the entire screening
process can be resolved in time.

followers is recently a popular research direction, while training LLM for
multi-modal reasoning remains less explored. Although the recent LLaMA-Adapter
demonstrates the potential to handle visual inputs with LLMs, it still cannot
generalize well to open-ended visual instructions and lags behind GPT-4. In
this paper, we present LLaMA-Adapter V2, a parameter-efficient visual
instruction model. Specifically, we first augment LLaMA-Adapter by unlocking
more learnable parameters (e.g., norm, bias and scale), which distribute the
instruction-following ability across the entire LLaMA model besides adapters.
Secondly, we propose an early fusion strategy to feed visual tokens only into
the early LLM layers, contributing to better visual knowledge incorporation.
Thirdly, a joint training paradigm of image-text pairs and
instruction-following data is introduced by optimizing disjoint groups of
learnable parameters. This strategy effectively alleviates the interference
between the two tasks of image-text alignment and instruction following and
achieves strong multi-modal reasoning with only a small-scale image-text and
instruction dataset. During inference, we incorporate additional expert models
(e.g. captioning/OCR systems) into LLaMA-Adapter to further enhance its image
understanding capability without incurring training costs. Compared to the
original LLaMA-Adapter, our LLaMA-Adapter V2 can perform open-ended multi-modal

adversarial training method for learning representations of audio recordings
that effectively prevents the detection of speech activity from the latent
features of the recordings. The proposed method trains a model to generate
invariant latent representations of speech-containing audio recordings that
cannot be distinguished from non-speech recordings by a speech classifier. The
novelty of our work is in the optimization algorithm, where the speech
classifier's weights are regularly replaced with the weights of classifiers
trained in a supervised manner. This increases the discrimination power of the
speech classifier constantly during the adversarial training, motivating the
model to generate latent representations in which speech is not
distinguishable, even using new speech classifiers trained outside the
adversarial training loop. The proposed method is evaluated against a baseline
approach with no privacy measures and a prior adversarial training method,
demonstrating a significant reduction in privacy violations compared to the
baseline approach. Additionally, we show that the prior adversarial method is
practically ineffective for this purpose.

scenario is the dark axion portal model. The primary decay chain that we study
is the Higgs to dark photon ($\gamma_D$) pairs that subsequently decay into a
photon ($\gamma$) and an axion-like particle ($a$). The axion-like particles
then decay into photon pairs. Hence, the signal is a six-photon Higgs decay:
$h\rightarrow \gamma_D\,\gamma_D\rightarrow 2\,\gamma 2\,a\rightarrow 6\gamma$.
However, depending on the relevant kinematics, the photons can become
well-collimated and appear as photon-jets (multiple photons that appear as a
single photon in the detector) or $\xi$-jets (non-isolated multi-photon signals
that do not pass the isolation criterion). These effects cause the true
six-photon resonance to appear as other multi-photon signals, such as two and
four photons. We classify the mass regions where two, four, and six-photon
resonances dominate. The four-photon signal is particularly interesting. These
events mainly occur when the photons from the axion-like particles are
collimated into photon-jets. The decay of the dark photon is then
$\gamma_D\rightarrow \gamma a\rightarrow \gamma+\gamma$-jet, which is an
apparent violation of the Landau-Yang theorem. We show that current
measurements of $h\rightarrow 2\gamma$ and searches for $h\rightarrow 4\gamma$
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) can limit ${\rm BR}(h\rightarrow
\gamma_D\gamma_D)\lesssim 10^{-3}$. This model also motivates new searches for
Higgs decays into six isolated photons or $\xi$-jets at the LHC. While there
are currently no dedicated searches, we show that many of the Higgs to six
isolated photons or $\xi$-jet events could pass two or three-photon triggers.
That is, new physics could be found by reanalyzing existing data. These
multi-photon signals provide excellent footing to explore new physics at the
LHC and beyond.

(CORE) making use of interferometric observations from the Northern Extended
Millimetre Array (NOEMA) for a sample of 20 luminous ($L>10^4L_\odot$)
protostellar objects in the 1.37 mm wavelength regime in both continuum and
line emission, reaching $\sim$0.4"" resolution (800 au at 2 kpc). Using the
dense gas tracer CH$_3$CN, we find velocity gradients across 13 cores
perpendicular to the directions of bipolar molecular outflows, making them
excellent disk candidates. Specific angular momentum ($j$) radial profiles are
on average $\sim10^{-3}$ km /s pc and follow $j \propto r^{1.7}$, consistent
with a poorly resolved rotating and infalling envelope/disk model. Fitting the
velocity profiles with a Keplerian model, we find protostellar masses in the
range of $\sim 10-25$ $M_\odot$. Modelling the level population of CH$_3$CN
lines, we present temperature maps and find median gas temperatures in the
range $70-210$ K. We create Toomre $Q$ maps to study the stability of the disks
and find almost all (11 of 13) disk candidates to be prone to fragmentation due
to gravitational instabilities at the scales probed by our observations. In
particular, disks with masses greater than $\sim10-20\%$ of the mass of their
host (proto)stars are Toomre unstable, and more luminous protostellar objects
tend to have disks that are more massive and hence more prone to fragmentation.
Our finings show that most disks around high-mass protostars are prone to disk
fragmentation early in their formation due to their high disk to stellar mass
ratio. This impacts the accretion evolution of high-mass protostars which will
have significant implications for the formation of the most massive stars.

(UT) was dominated by the measurements of its sides $R_b$ and $R_t$ through
tree-level $B$ decays and the $\Delta M_d/\Delta M_s$ ratio, respectively, with
some participation of the measurements of the angle $\beta$ through the mixing
induced CP-asymmetries like $S_{\psi K_S}$ and $\varepsilon_K$. However, as
pointed out already in 2002 by Fabrizio Parodi, Achille Stocchi and the present
author, the most efficient strategy for a precise determination of the apex of
the UT, that is $(\bar\varrho,\bar\eta)$, is to use the measurements of the
angles $\beta$ and $\gamma$. The second best strategy would be the measurements
of $R_b$ and $\gamma$. However, in view of the tensions between different
determinations of $|V_{ub}|$ and $|V_{cb}|$, that enter $R_b$, the
$(\beta,\gamma)$ strategy should be a clear winner once LHCb and Belle II will
improve the measurements of these two angles. In this note we recall our
finding of 2002 which should be finally realized in this decade through precise
measurements of both angles by these collaborations. In this context we present
two very simple formulae for $\bar\varrho$ and $\bar\eta$ in terms of $\beta$
and $\gamma$ which could be derived by high-school students, but to my
knowledge never appeared in the literature on the UT, not even in our 2002
paper. We also emphasize the importance of precise measurements of both angles
that would allow to perform powerful tests of the SM through numerous
$|V_{cb}|$-independent correlations between $K$ and $B$ decay branching ratios

linear perturbation theory, which is valid only in the fast limit where the bar
changes its pattern speed rapidly, or on adiabatic theory, which is applicable
only in the slow limit where the bar's pattern speed is near-constant. In this
paper, we study dynamical friction on galactic bars spinning down at an
arbitrary speed, seamlessly connecting the fast and slow limits. We treat the
bar-halo interaction as a restricted $N$-body problem and solve the
collisionless Boltzmann equation using the angle-averaged Hamiltonian. The
phase-space distribution and density wakes predicted by our averaged model are
in excellent agreement with full 3D simulations. In the slow regime where
resonant trapping occurs, we show that, in addition to the frictional torque,
angular momentum is transferred directly due to the migration of the trapped
phase-space: trapped orbits comoving with the resonance typically gain angular
momentum, while untrapped orbits leaping over the trapped island lose angular
momentum. Due to the negative gradient in the distribution function, gainers
typically outnumber the losers, resulting in a net negative torque on the
perturber. The torque due to the untrapped orbits was identified by Tremaine &
Weinberg, who named the phenomenon dynamical feedback. Here we derive the
complete formula for dynamical feedback, accounting for both trapped and
untrapped orbits. Using our revised formula, we show that dynamical feedback
can comprise up to $30\%$ of the total torque on the Milky Way's bar.

estimating the contribution of each layer of information to the determination
of the structure of the fused network. A clustering algorithm is lastly applied
to the fused network for obtaining a classification of articles. The
classification obtained through SNF has been evaluated from an expert point of
view, by inspecting whether it can be interpreted and labelled with reference
to research programs and methodologies adopted in economics. Moreover, the
classification obtained in the fused network is compared with the two
classifications obtained when cited references and contents are considered

probing inflaton couplings with visible sector particles that can either be
bosonic or fermionic in nature. Assuming reheating takes place through
perturbative quantum production from vacuum in presence of classical inflaton
background field, we find that the spectral energy density of the primordial GW
generated during inflation becomes sensitive to inflaton-matter coupling. We
conclude, obeying bounds from Big Bang Nucleosysthesis and Cosmic Microwave
Background, that, e.g., inflaton-scalar couplings of the order of
$\sim\mathcal{O}(10^{-20})$ GeV fall within the sensitivity range of several
proposed GW detector facilities. However, this prediction is sensitive to the
size of the inflationary scale, nature of the inflaton-matter interaction and
shape of the potential during reheating. Having found the time-dependent
effective inflaton decay width, we also discuss its implications for dark
matter (DM) production from the thermal plasma via UV freeze-in during
reheating. It is shown, that one can reproduce the observed DM abundance for
its mass up to several PeVs, depending on the dimension of the operator
connecting DM with the thermal bath and the associated scale of the UV physics.
Thus we promote primordial GW to observables sensitive to feebly coupled
inflaton, which is very challenging if not impossible to test in conventional
particle physics laboratories or astrophysical measurements.

inner engine is generally expected to be a black hole or a highly magnetic
neutron star (magnetar) accreting high density matter. Recognizing the nature
of GRB central engines, and in particular the formation of neutron stars (NSs),
is of high astrophysical significance. A possible signature of NSs in GRBs is
the presence of a plateau in the early X-ray afterglow. Here we carefully
select a subset of long and short GRBs with a clear plateau, and look for an
additional NS signature in their prompt emission, namely a transition between
accretion and propeller in analogy with accreting, magnetic compact objects in
other astrophysical sources. We estimate from the prompt emission the minimum
accretion luminosity below which the propeller mechanism sets in, and the NS
magnetic field and spin period from the plateau. We demonstrate that these
three quantities obey the same universal relation in GRBs as in other accreting
compact objects switching from accretion to propeller. This relation provides
also an estimate of the radiative efficiency of GRBs, which we find to be
several times lower than radiatively efficient accretion in X-ray binaries and
in agreement with theoretical expectations. These results provide additional
support to the idea that at least some GRBs are powered by magnetars surrounded
by an accretion disc.

offered as a service. Although Minecraft is architected as a distributed
system, in production it achieves this scale by partitioning small groups of
players over isolated game instances. From the approaches that can help other
kinds of virtual worlds scale, none is designed to scale MVEs, which pose a
unique challenge -- a mix between the count and complexity of active in-game
constructs, player-created in-game programs, and strict quality of service.
Serverless computing emerged recently and focuses, among others, on service
scalability. Thus, addressing this challenge, in this work we explore using
serverless computing to improve MVE scalability. To this end, we design,
prototype, and evaluate experimentally Servo, a serverless backend architecture
for MVEs. We implement Servo as a prototype and evaluate it using real-world
experiments on two commercial serverless platforms, of Amazon Web Services
(AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Results offer strong support that our serverless MVE
can significantly increase the number of supported players per instance without
performance degradation, in our key experiment by 40 to 140 players per

input NeRFs were recently regularized by providing dense depth estimated from
pre-trained networks as supervision, to achieve improved performance over

successfully train the NeRF with few input views. We reformulate the NeRF to
also directly output the visibility of a 3D point from a given viewpoint to
reduce the training time with the visibility constraint. On multiple datasets,

Knowing their demographics is important to test their overall impact on

suggest a decrease beyond. Aims. We aim at understanding the limitations
associated with the characterization of long-period giant radial velocity
planets, and to estimate their impact on the radial distribution of these

derived such radial distributions, using the RV data available at the time of

low-cost DDWP forecasts make their use in operational forecasting an attractive
proposition, however, there remains work to be done in rigorously evaluating
DDWPs in a true operational setting. Typically trained and evaluated using ERA5
reanalysis data, DDWPs have been tested only in a simulation, which cannot
represent the real world with complete accuracy even if it is of a very high
quality. The safe use of DDWPs in operational forecasting requires more
thorough ""real-world"" verification, as well as a careful examination of how
DDWPs are currently trained and evaluated. It is worth asking, for instance,
how well do the reanalysis datasets, used for training, simulate the real
world? With an eye towards climate justice and the uneven availability of
weather data: is the simulation equally good for all regions of the world, and
would DDWPs exacerbate biases present in the training data? Does a good
performance in simulation correspond to good performance in operational
settings? In addition to approximating the physics of NWP models, how can ML be
uniquely deployed to provide more accurate weather forecasts? As a first step
towards answering such questions, we present a robust dataset of in-situ
observations derived from the NOAA MADIS program to serve as a benchmark to
validate DDWPs in an operational setting. By providing a large corpus of
quality-controlled, in-situ observations, this dataset provides a meaningful
real-world task that all NWPs and DDWPs can be tested against. We hope that
this data can be used not only to rigorously and fairly compare operational

further our understanding of LLMs and their causal implications, considering
the distinctions between different types of causal reasoning tasks, as well as
the entangled threats of construct and measurement validity. LLM-based methods
establish new state-of-the-art accuracies on multiple causal benchmarks.
Algorithms based on GPT-3.5 and 4 outperform existing algorithms on a pairwise
causal discovery task (97%, 13 points gain), counterfactual reasoning task
(92%, 20 points gain), and actual causality (86% accuracy in determining
necessary and sufficient causes in vignettes). At the same time, LLMs exhibit
unpredictable failure modes and we provide some techniques to interpret their
robustness.
  Crucially, LLMs perform these causal tasks while relying on sources of
knowledge and methods distinct from and complementary to non-LLM based
approaches. Specifically, LLMs bring capabilities so far understood to be
restricted to humans, such as using collected knowledge to generate causal
graphs or identifying background causal context from natural language. We
envision LLMs to be used alongside existing causal methods, as a proxy for
human domain knowledge and to reduce human effort in setting up a causal
analysis, one of the biggest impediments to the widespread adoption of causal
methods. We also see existing causal methods as promising tools for LLMs to
formalize, validate, and communicate their reasoning especially in high-stakes
scenarios.
  In capturing common sense and domain knowledge about causal mechanisms and
supporting translation between natural language and formal methods, LLMs open

the validation performance of a learning algorithm among the training data. As
a result, the calculated data values depend on many design choices of the
underlying learning algorithm. However, this dependence is undesirable for many
use cases of data valuation, such as setting priorities over different data
sources in a data acquisition process and informing pricing mechanisms in a
data marketplace. In these scenarios, data needs to be valued before the actual
analysis and the choice of the learning algorithm is still undetermined then.
Another side-effect of the dependence is that to assess the value of individual
points, one needs to re-run the learning algorithm with and without a point,
which incurs a large computation burden.
  This work leapfrogs over the current limits of data valuation methods by
introducing a new framework that can value training data in a way that is
oblivious to the downstream learning algorithm. (1) We develop a proxy for the
validation performance associated with a training set based on a
non-conventional class-wise Wasserstein distance between the training and the
validation set. We show that the distance characterizes the upper bound of the
validation performance for any given model under certain Lipschitz conditions.
(2) We develop a novel method to value individual data based on the sensitivity
analysis of the class-wise Wasserstein distance. Importantly, these values can
be directly obtained for free from the output of off-the-shelf optimization
solvers when computing the distance. (3) We evaluate our new data valuation
framework over various use cases related to detecting low-quality data and show
that, surprisingly, the learning-agnostic feature of our framework enables a
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art performance while being
orders of magnitude faster.

supernovae (SNe) have been theorized to supplement, or even dominate,
r-production by NSMs. However, the most direct evidence for such SNe, unusual
reddening of the emission caused by the high opacities of r-process elements,
has not been observed. Recent work identified the distribution of r-process
material within the SN ejecta as a key predictor of the ease with which signals
associated with r-process enrichment could be discerned. Though this
distribution results from hydrodynamic processes at play during the SN
explosion, thus far it has been treated only in a parameterized way. We use
hydrodynamic simulations to model how disk winds, the alleged locus of
r-production in rare SNe, mix with initially r-process-free ejecta. We study
mixing as a function of the wind mass and duration and of the initial SN
explosion energy, and find that it increases with the first two of these and
decreases with the third. This suggests that SNe accompanying the longest
long-duration gamma-ray bursts are promising places to search for signs of
r-process enrichment. We use semianalytic radiation transport to connect
hydrodynamics to electromagnetic observables, allowing us to assess the mixing
level at which the presence of r-process material can be diagnosed from SN
light curves. Analytic arguments constructed atop this foundation imply that a
wind-driven r-process-enriched SN model is unlikely to explain standard
energetic SNe.

first law of thermodynamics in such systems. Consistency requires the
independence of the potential of the mass, imposing in this way the dependence
of the mass on the scalar charge of a type that varies with the value of $D$,
and according to the no-hair theorem dressing the regular black hole solution
with secondary hair. In $D=3,4$ we demonstrate that the potential depends on
the ratio of the scalar charge over the mass, and thus considered as a

higher-dimensional cases. Calculating the $D-$dimensional Kretschmann scalar we
show that it is finite at the centre point $r=0$ for arbitrary $D$, rendering

at $r=0$, hence the radial coordinate of our manifold is defined for $r \ge 0$.

determining the binding PES or torsion PES for several molecules of varying

representation-independent approaches often work better with students, by
comparing student reactions to learning the series solution of the harmonic
oscillator versus the abstract operator method. Because one can teach all of
the solvable quantum problems using a similar abstract method, it brings up the
question, which is likely to lead to a better student understanding? In work at
Georgetown University and with edX, we have been teaching a class focused on an
operator-forward viewpoint, which we like to call operator mechanics. It
teaches quantum mechanics in a representation-independent fashion and allows
for most of the math to be algebraic, rather than based on differential
equations. It relies on four fundamental operator identities -- (i) the Leibniz

  Its decay has extensively been studied in Approximation Theory and for the

  Particular interest has occurred within Model Order Reduction (MOR) of
parameterized PDEs e.g.\ by the Reduced Basis Method (RBM).
  While it is known that the $N$-width decays exponentially fast (and thus
admits efficient MOR) for certain problems, there are examples of the linear
transport and the wave equation, where the decay rate deteriorates to
$N^{-1/2}$.
  On the other hand, it is widely accepted that a smooth parameter dependence
admits a fast decay of the $N$-width.
  However, a detailed analysis of the influence of properties of the data (such
as regularity or slope) on the rate of the $N$-width seems to lack.
  In this paper, we use techniques from Fourier Analysis to derive exact
representations of the $N$-width in terms of initial and boundary conditions of
the linear transport equation modeled by some function $g$ for half-wave

thus the origin of fermion mass hierarchies and mixing pattern remains
puzzling. On the other hand, there are intriguing relations between fermion
masses and mixing angles which may point towards specific textures of Yukawa
matrices. One of the classic hypothesis is the zero texture proposed by
Fritzsch which is, however, excluded by present precision tests since it
predicts a too large value of $|V_{cb}|$ as well as a too small value of the
ratio $|V_{ub}/V_{cb}|$. In this paper we discuss a minimal modification which
still maintains the six zero entries as in the original Fritzsch ansatz. This
modification consists in introducing an asymmetry between the 23 and 32 entries
in the down-quark Yukawa matrix. We show that this flavour structure can
naturally emerge in the context of models with inter-family $SU(3)_H$ symmetry.
We present a detailed analysis of this Fritzsch-like texture by testing its
predictions and showing that it is perfectly compatible with the present
precision data on quark masses and CKM mixing matrix.

$p_\mathrm{astro}$ incorporates the rate at which triggers are generated by
both astrophysical signals and instrumental noise in estimating the probability
that a candidate is astrophysical. Multiple search pipelines can independently
calculate $p_\mathrm{astro}$, each employing a specific data reduction. While
the range of $p_\mathrm{astro}$ results can help indicate the range of
uncertainties in its calculation, it complicates interpretation and subsequent
analyses. We develop a statistical formalism to calculate a $\textit{unified }
p_\mathrm{astro}$ for gravitational-wave candidates, consistently accounting
for triggers from all pipelines, thereby incorporating extra information about
a signal that is not available with any one single pipeline. We demonstrate the
properties of this method using a toy model and by application to the publicly

scalable, as the involvement of a stakeholder in each interview requires a lot
of time and effort. [Principal Idea] To address this problem, we propose REIT,
an extensible architecture for Requirements Elicitation Interview Trainer
system based on emerging technologies for education. It has two separate
phases. The first is the interview phase, where the student acts as an
interviewer and the system as an interviewee. The second is the feedback phase,
where the system evaluates the student's performance and provides contextual
and behavioral feedback to enhance their interviewing skills.
[Results/Contribution] We demonstrate the applicability of REIT by implementing
two instances: RoREIT with an embodied physical robotic agent and VoREIT with a
virtual voice-only agent. We empirically evaluated these two instances with a
target user group consisting of graduate students. The results reveal that the
students appreciated both systems. The participants demonstrated higher
learning gain when trained with RoREIT, but they found VoREIT more engaging and
easier to use. These findings indicate that each system has its distinct
benefits and drawbacks, suggesting that our generic architecture REIT can be
configured for various educational settings based on preferences and available
resources.

representation space that reflects the interaction between distortion and
semantic context present in this data modality. Fisheye data has the wider
field of view advantage over other types of cameras, but this comes at the
expense of high radial distortion. As a result, objects further from the center
exhibit deformations that make it difficult for a model to identify their
semantic context. While previous work has attempted architectural and training
augmentation changes to alleviate this effect, no work has attempted to guide
the model towards learning a representation space that reflects this
interaction between distortion and semantic context inherent to fisheye data.
We introduce an approach to exploit this relationship by first extracting
distortion class labels based on an object's distance from the center of the
image. We then shape a backbone's representation space with a weighted
contrastive loss that constrains objects of the same semantic class and
distortion class to be close to each other within a lower dimensional embedding
space. This backbone trained with both semantic and distortion information is
then fine-tuned within an object detection setting to empirically evaluate the
quality of the learnt representation. We show this method leads to performance
improvements by as much as 1.1% mean average precision over standard object
detection strategies and .6% improvement over other state of the art
representation learning approaches.

about its state. This viewpoint is widely held both in practical applications
and foundational research. The former applications treat information theory as
a pure mathematical tool; while in the latter, information plays a central role
in many reconstructions of quantum theory. However, the concept of information
is usually remained obscure. We are investigating the information towards the
reconstruction of quantum theory from an operational approach: what is the
information gained from the quantum measurement data. We start from the
generalization of continuous entropy and find there is more than one natural
measure of the information gained as more data is received. One of these
(differential information gain) can increase or decrease with more data,
depending upon the prior; another measure (relative information gain) is an
increasing function of the amount of data even when the amount of data is
finite, and is asymptotically insensitive to the specific data or choice of
prior. Both two measures can be regarded as extensions of relative entropy.
  We propose a Principle of Information Increase from Summhammer's intuitive
idea: more data lead to more knowledge. This principle is used to filter
choices of prior for prior-sensitive information measures when investigating
the information gain from data of quantum measurements. Both numerical and
asymptotic analysis are conducted using beta distribution priors. It is showed
that in two-outcome quantum systems differential information gain will be more
physical meaningful and Jeffreys' prior exhibits a special behavior which is
the strong robustness of information gain over all possible data. The expected
values of both information gain are equivalent, which suggests that the
expected form is unique and the discrepancies are disappeared when taking the
averages.

""Sentiment Analysis for Low-resource African Languages using Twitter Dataset"".
Sentiment analysis is one of the most widely studied applications in natural
language processing. However, most prior work still focuses on a small number
of high-resource languages. Building reliable sentiment analysis systems for
low-resource languages remains challenging, due to the limited training data in
this task. In this work, we propose to leverage language-adaptive and
task-adaptive pretraining on African texts and study transfer learning with
source language selection on top of an African language-centric pretrained
language model. Our key findings are: (1) Adapting the pretrained model to the
target language and task using a small yet relevant corpus improves performance
remarkably by more than 10 F1 score points. (2) Selecting source languages with
positive transfer gains during training can avoid harmful interference from
dissimilar languages, leading to better results in multilingual and
cross-lingual settings. In the shared task, our system wins 8 out of 15 tracks
and, in particular, performs best in the multilingual evaluation.

Stiefel manifold arising from machine learning. General speaking, the approach
first turns the first order optimality condition, also known as the KKT
condition, into a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with eigenvector dependency
(NEPv) or a nonlinear polar decomposition with orthogonal factor dependency
(NPDo) and then solve the nonlinear problem via some variations of the
self-consistent-field (SCF) iteration. The difficulty, however, lies in
designing a proper SCF iteration so that a maximizer is found at the end.
Currently, each use of the approach is very much individualized, especially in
its convergence analysis to show that the approach does work or otherwise. In
this paper, a unifying framework is established. The framework is built upon
some basic assumptions. If the basic assumptions are satisfied, globally
convergence is guaranteed to a stationary point and during the SCF iterative
process that leads to the stationary point, the objective function increases
monotonically. Also a notion of atomic functions is proposed, which include
commonly used matrix traces of linear and quadratic forms as special ones. It
is shown that the basic assumptions are satisfied by atomic functions and by
convex compositions of atomic functions. Together they provide a large
collection of objectives for which the NEPv/NPDo approach is guaranteed to
work.

moving objects. We propose to improve gradient computation by continuous
collision detection and leverage the time-of-impact (TOI) to calculate the
post-collision velocities. We demonstrate our proposed method, referred to as
TOI-Velocity, on two optimal control problems. We show that with TOI-Velocity,

on spin ice vertices, serve as the origin of magnetic monopoles that traverse
the underlying lattice effortlessly. Unlike spin ice materials of atomic
origin, the dynamic state in artificial honeycomb spin ice is conventionally
described in terms of finite size domain wall kinetics that require magnetic
field or current application. Contrary to this common understanding, here we
show that thermally tunable artificial permalloy honeycomb lattice manifests a
perpetual dynamic state due to self-propelled magnetic charge defect relaxation
in the absence of any external tuning agent. Quantitative investigation of
magnetic charge defect dynamics using neutron spin echo spectroscopy reveals
sub-ns relaxation times that are comparable to monopole's relaxation in bulk
spin ices. Most importantly, the kinetic process remains unabated at low
temperature where thermal fluctuation is negligible. This suggests that dynamic
phenomena in honeycomb spin ice are mediated by quasi-particle type entities,
also confirmed by quantum Monte-Carlo simulations that replicate the kinetic

approaches, instead, enable the description of systems evolution in
low-dimensional latent spaces, by leveraging dimensionality reduction and deep
learning algorithms. We propose a novel architecture, named Latent Dynamics
Network (LDNet), which is able to discover low-dimensional intrinsic dynamics
of possibly non-Markovian dynamical systems, thus predicting the time evolution
of space-dependent fields in response to external inputs. Unlike popular
approaches, in which the latent representation of the solution manifold is
learned by means of auto-encoders that map a high-dimensional discretization of
the system state into itself, LDNets automatically discover a low-dimensional
manifold while learning the latent dynamics, without ever operating in the
high-dimensional space. Furthermore, LDNets are meshless algorithms that do not
reconstruct the output on a predetermined grid of points, but rather at any
point of the domain, thus enabling weight-sharing across query-points. These
features make LDNets lightweight and easy-to-train, with excellent accuracy and
generalization properties, even in time-extrapolation regimes. We validate our
method on several test cases and we show that, for a challenging

to quantify the contribution to the forcing by each pair of triplets and are
computed using data from direct numerical simulations of a turbulent channel at

predicted to display a range of interesting physics and functional properties,
but they are under-explored due to the difficulty of synthesizing oxygen-free
nitrides. LaWN3, recently reported as the first oxygen-free nitride perovskite,
exhibited polar symmetry and a large piezoelectric coefficient. However, the
predicted ferroelectric switching was hindered by large leakage current, which
motivates better understanding of its electronic structure and optical
properties. Here, we study the structure and optoelectronic properties of thin
film LaWN3 in greater detail, employing combinatorial techniques to correlate
these properties with cation stoichiometry. We report a two-step synthesis that
utilizes a more common RF substrate bias instead of a nitrogen plasma source,
yielding nanocrystalline films that are crystallized by ex-situ annealing. We
investigate the structure and composition of these films, finding
polycrystalline La-rich and highly textured W-rich films. The optical
absorption onset and temperature- and magnetic field-dependent resistivity are
consistent with semiconducting behavior and are highly sensitive to cation
stoichiometry, which may be related to amorphous impurities: metallic W or WNx
in W-rich samples and insulating La2O3 in La-rich samples. The fractional
magnetoresistance is linear and small, consistent with defect scattering, and a
W-rich sample has n-type carriers with high densities and low mobilities. We
demonstrate a photoresponse in LaWN3: the resistivity of a La-rich sample is
enhanced by 28% at low temperature, likely due to a defect trapping mechanism.
The physical properties of LaWN3 are highly sensitive to cation stoichiometry,
like many oxide perovskites, which therefore calls for precise composition
control to utilize the interesting properties observed in this nitride
perovskite.

models has sparked the development of machine learning (ML) based emulators.
Because ML methods benefit from long records of training data, it is common to
use datasets that are temporally subsampled relative to the time steps required
for the numerical integration of differential equations. Here, we investigate
how this often overlooked processing step affects the quality of an emulator's
predictions. We implement two ML architectures from a class of methods called
reservoir computing: (1) a form of Nonlinear Vector Autoregression (NVAR), and
(2) an Echo State Network (ESN). Despite their simplicity, it is well
documented that these architectures excel at predicting low dimensional chaotic
dynamics. We are therefore motivated to test these architectures in an
idealized setting of predicting high dimensional geophysical turbulence as
represented by Surface Quasi-Geostrophic dynamics. In all cases, subsampling
the training data consistently leads to an increased bias at small spatial
scales that resembles numerical diffusion. Interestingly, the NVAR architecture
becomes unstable when the temporal resolution is increased, indicating that the
polynomial based interactions are insufficient at capturing the detailed
nonlinearities of the turbulent flow. The ESN architecture is found to be more
robust, suggesting a benefit to the more expensive but more general structure.
Spectral errors are reduced by including a penalty on the kinetic energy
density spectrum during training, although the subsampling related errors
persist. Future work is warranted to understand how the temporal resolution of
training data affects other ML architectures.

poromechanical stress changes that can lead to the dilation of fractures due to
fracture slip and to tensile fracture opening and propagation, so-called
mixed-mechanism stimulation. The effective permeability of the rock is
particularly enhanced when new fractures connect with pre-existing fractures.
Mixed-mechanism stimulation can significantly improve the productivity of
geothermal reservoirs, and the technique is especially important in reservoirs
where the natural permeability of the rock is insufficient to allow for
commercial flow rates. This paper presents a modeling approach for simulating
the deformation and expansion of fracture networks in porous media under the
influence of anisotropic stress and fluid injection. It utilizes a coupled
hydromechanical model for poroelastic, fractured media. Fractures are governed
by contact mechanics and allowed to grow and connect through a fracture

We corroborate this result by fixing the gauge with the standard

We repeat the analysis in an alternative gauge which makes explicit the
appearance of a dynamic spin-1/2 sector. We then carry out the constrained
Hamiltonian analysis and observe that the elimination of the spin-1/2 sector
results from assuming the Dirac conjecture as valid but this situation,
described by the extended Hamiltonian, corresponds to a dynamical system
different from the original one. Considering the total (unextended)
Hamiltonian, which generates an evolution equivalent to the Lagrangian one, all
the constraints can be solved by gauge fixing conditions corresponding to the
freedom generated by the primary first-class constraints. Hence we conclude
that the elimination of the spin-half mode in the study of the massless

leverages ChatGPT large-language models (LLMs) to automatically generate and
surface source-level human-readable summaries. With the imminent re-start of
the next-generation of gravitational wave detectors, SkyPortal now also
includes dedicated multi-messenger features addressing the requirements of
rapid multi-messenger follow-up: multi-telescope management, team/group
organizing interfaces, and cross-matching of multi-messenger data streams with
time-domain optical surveys, with interfaces sufficiently intuitive for the
newcomers to the field. (abridged)

Presently, the medical segmentation landscape is dominated by numerous
specialized deep learning models, each fine-tuned for specific segmentation
tasks and image modalities. The recently-introduced Segment Anything Model
(SAM) employs the ViT neural architecture and harnesses a massive training
dataset to segment nearly any object; however, its suitability to the medical
domain has not yet been investigated. In this study, we explore the zero-shot
performance of SAM in medical imaging by implementing eight distinct prompt
strategies across six datasets from four imaging modalities, including X-ray,
ultrasound, dermatoscopy, and colonoscopy. Our findings reveal that SAM's
zero-shot performance is not only comparable to, but in certain cases,
surpasses the current state-of-the-art. Based on these results, we propose
practical guidelines that require minimal interaction while consistently
yielding robust outcomes across all assessed contexts. The source code, along

source of Markovian dissipation on top of the non-Markovian dynamics due to an
Ohmic bath, and investigate the dynamics of the spin. We show that the
characteristic frequency of the spin dynamics, while strongly renormalized by
the bosonic bath, changes in a simple fashion (or doesn't change at all) with
dephasing. To obtain these results, we develop an exact non-perturbative method
known as the stochastic Schr\""{o}dinger equation, mimicking the Ohmic bath via
a stochastic magnetic field combined with the Lindblad quantum master equation
due to dephasing, which allows us to numerically compute the dynamics.
Furthermore, we derive weak-coupling analytic results utilizing the well-known
non-interacting blip approximation. Our findings are relevant to quantum
simulation of the spin-boson model in the regime of strong coupling in trapped

when scattered by cosmic-ray nuclei, using a module of the NEWSdm experiment.
The boosted Dark Matter flux at the edge of the Earth's atmosphere is expected
to be pointing to the Galactic Center, with a flux 15 to 20 times larger than
in the transverse direction.
  The module of the NEWSdm experiment consists of a 10 kg stack of Nano Imaging
Trackers, i.e.~newly developed nuclear emulsions with AgBr crystal sizes down
to a few tens of nanometers. The module is installed on an equatorial
telescope. The relatively long recoil tracks induced by boosted Dark Matter,
combined with the nanometric granularity of the emulsion, result in an
extremely low background. This makes an installation at the INFN Gran Sasso
laboratory, both on the surface and underground, viable. A comparison between
the two locations is made. The angular distribution of nuclear recoils induced
by boosted Dark Matter in the emulsion films at the surface laboratory is
expected to show an excess with a factor of 3.5 in the direction of the
Galactic Center. This excess allows for a Dark Matter search with directional
sensitivity. The surface laboratory configuration prevents the deterioration of
the signal in the rock overburden and it emerges as the most powerful approach
for a directional observation of boosted Dark Matter with high sensitivity. We
show that, with this approach, a 10 kg module of the NEWSdm experiment exposed
for one year at the Gran Sasso surface laboratory can probe Dark Matter masses
between 1 keV/c$^2$ and 1 GeV/c$^2$ and cross-section values down to
$10^{-30}$~cm$^2$ with a directional sensitive search.

gained increased attention in the automatic speech recognition (ASR) community.
Typical SSL methods include autoregressive predictive coding (APC), Wav2vec2.0,

pretraining data. When SSL models are finetuned with data from another domain,
domain shifting occurs and might cause limited knowledge transfer for
downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, domain
responsible adaptation and finetuning (DRAFT), to reduce domain shifting in
pretrained speech models, and evaluate it for a causal and non-causal
transformer. For the causal transformer, an extension of APC (E-APC) is
proposed to learn richer information from unlabelled data by using multiple
temporally-shifted sequences to perform prediction. For the non-causal
transformer, various solutions for using the bidirectional APC (Bi-APC) are
investigated. In addition, the DRAFT framework is examined for Wav2vec2.0 and
HuBERT methods, which use non-causal transformers as the backbone. The
experiments are conducted on child ASR (using the OGI and MyST databases) using
SSL models trained with unlabelled adult speech data from Librispeech. The
relative WER improvements of up to 19.7% on the two child tasks are observed
when compared to the pretrained models without adaptation. With the proposed
methods (E-APC and DRAFT), the relative WER improvements are even larger (30%

important classes of matroids given in explicit form. Currently, nearly-linear
time algorithms only exist for graphic and partition matroids [ICALP '19]. In
this work, we develop algorithms for monotone submodular maximization
constrained by graphic, transversal matroids, or laminar matroids in time
near-linear in the size of their representation. Our algorithms achieve an
optimal approximation of $1-1/e-\epsilon$ and both generalize and accelerate
the results of Ene and Nguyen [ICALP '19]. In fact, the running time of our
algorithm cannot be improved within the fast continuous greedy framework of
Badanidiyuru and Vondr\'ak [SODA '14].
  To achieve near-linear running time, we make use of dynamic data structures

decrease operation and a novel FREEZE operation that allows the algorithm to
freeze elements (i.e. force to be contained) in its basis regardless of future
data structure operations.

top tree interface of Alstrup, Holm, de Lichtenberg, and Thorup [TALG '05] that
maintains the maximum weight basis under insertions and deletions of elements
in $O(\log n)$ time. For the transversal matroid the FREEZE operation
corresponds to requiring the data structure to keep a certain set $S$ of

Neurons are commonly modeled as nonlinear systems, and questions such as

signals of slightly different frequencies, and thus classical averaging
(well-adapted to deal with a single frequency) cannot be directly applied. In
this paper, we consider the one-dimensional FitzHugh-Nagumo system under the
effects of a source composed of two terms that are sinusoidal in time and
quadratically decaying in space. To study this setting we develop a new
averaging strategy to prove that, when the frequencies involved are
sufficiently high, the full system can be approximated by an explicit
highly-oscillatory term plus the solution of a simpler -- albeit non-autonomous
-- system. This decomposition can be seen as a stability result around a
varying trajectory. One of the main novelties of the proofs presented here is
an extension of the contracting rectangles method to the case of parabolic

essential to many spray applications. A parametric numerical study was
performed by varying the gas stream velocity, focusing on the regime of
moderate Weber numbers, in which the drop deforms to a forward bag. When the
bag is unstable, it inflates and disintegrates into small droplets. Detailed
numerical simulations were conducted using the volume-of-fluid method on an
adaptive octree mesh to investigate the aerobreakup dynamics. Grid-refinement
studies show that converged 3D simulation results for drop deformation and bag
formation are achieved by the refinement level equivalent to 512 cells across
the initial drop diameter. To resolve the thin liquid sheet when the bag
inflates, the mesh is further refined to 2048 cells across the initial drop
diameter. The simulation results for the drop length and radius were validated
against previous experiments, and a good agreement was achieved. The
high-resolution results of drop morphological evolution were used to identify
the different phases in the aerobreakup process, characterize the distinct flow
features and dominant mechanisms in each phase. In the early time, the drop
deformation and velocity are independent of the Weber number, and a new
internal-flow deformation model, which respects this asymptotic limit, has been
developed. The pressure and velocity fields around the drop were shown to
better understand the internal flow and interfacial instability that dictate
the drop deformation. Finally, the impact of drop deformation on the drop
dynamics was discussed.

in an Internet of Things (IoT)-Driven isolated microgrid (MG) by deep
reinforcement learning (DRL). The renewable energy is fully exploited under the
uncertainty of renewable generation and load demand. The DRL agent learns an
optimal policy from history renewable and load data of previous days, where the
policy can generate real-time decisions based on observations of past renewable
and load data of previous hours collected by connected sensors. The goal is to
reduce operating cost on the premise of ensuring supply-demand balance. In
specific, a novel finite-horizon partial observable Markov decision process
(POMDP) model is conceived considering the spinning reserve. In order to
overcome the challenge of discrete-continuous hybrid action space due to the
binary DG switching decision and continuous energy dispatch (ED) decision, a
DRL algorithm, namely the hybrid action finite-horizon RDPG (HAFH-RDPG), is
proposed. HAFH-RDPG seamlessly integrates two classical DRL algorithms, i.e.,
deep Q-network (DQN) and recurrent deterministic policy gradient (RDPG), based
on a finite-horizon dynamic programming (DP) framework. Extensive experiments
are performed with real-world data in an IoT-driven MG to evaluate the
capability of the proposed algorithm in handling the uncertainty due to
inter-hour and inter-day power fluctuation and to compare its performance with
those of the benchmark algorithms.

which has hardly been considered in the literature. We determine $F_{\pi}$ by
three independent methods, with numerical and analytical ingredients. First, we
consider the 2-dimensional version of the Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner relation,
where we insert both theoretical and numerical values for the quantities
involved. Next we refer to the $\delta$-regime, {\it i.e.}\ a small spatial
volume, where we assume formulae from Chiral Perturbation Theory to apply even
in the absence of Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We further postulate an effective
relation between $N_{\rm f}$ and the number of relevant, light bosons, which we
denote as ``pions''. Thus $F_{\pi}$ is obtained from the residual ``pion'' mass
in the chiral limit, which is a finite-size effect. Finally, we address to the
2-dimensional Witten--Veneziano formula: it yields a value for $F_{\eta}$,
which we identify with $F_{\pi}$, as in large-$N_{\rm c}$ QCD. All three
approaches consistently lead to $F_{\pi} \simeq 1/\sqrt{2 \pi}$ at fermion mass
$m=0$, which implies that this quantity is meaningful.

  Structural Constraints",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-training based on pseudo-labels has emerged as a dominant approach for
addressing conditional distribution shifts in unsupervised domain adaptation
(UDA) for semantic segmentation problems. A notable drawback, however, is that
this family of approaches is susceptible to erroneous pseudo labels that arise
from confirmation biases in the source domain and that manifest as nuisance
factors in the target domain. A possible source for this mismatch is the
reliance on only photometric cues provided by RGB image inputs, which may
ultimately lead to sub-optimal adaptation. To mitigate the effect of mismatched
pseudo-labels, we propose to incorporate structural cues from auxiliary
modalities, such as depth, to regularise conventional self-training objectives.
Specifically, we introduce a contrastive pixel-level objectness constraint that
pulls the pixel representations within a region of an object instance closer,
while pushing those from different object categories apart. To obtain object
regions consistent with the true underlying object, we extract information from
both depth maps and RGB-images in the form of multimodal clustering. Crucially,
the objectness constraint is agnostic to the ground-truth semantic labels and,
hence, appropriate for unsupervised domain adaptation. In this work, we show
that our regularizer significantly improves top performing self-training
methods (by up to $2$ points) in various UDA benchmarks for semantic
segmentation. We include all code in the supplementary.

sampling from the data distribution. Nevertheless, GAN-based SI generation is
challenging since the high-dimensionality nature of this kind of data hinders
the convergence of the GAN training yielding to suboptimal generation. To
surmount this limitation, we propose low-dimensional GAN (LD-GAN), where we
train the GAN employing a low-dimensional representation of the {dataset} with
the latent space of a pretrained autoencoder network. Thus, we generate new
low-dimensional samples which are then mapped to the SI dimension with the

Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with a periodic potential are investigated.
Based on the defocusing nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger (NLS) equation with an
elliptic function potential, the well-known modulational instability (MI), the
more recently identified high-frequency instability, and an unprecedented -- to
our knowledge -- variant of the MI, the so-called isola instability are
identified numerically. Upon varying parameters of the solutions, instability
transitions occur through the suitable bifurcations, such as the Hamiltonian
Hope one. Specifically, (i) increasing the elliptic modulus $k$ of the
solutions, we find that MI switches to the isola instability and the dominant
disturbance has twice the elliptic wave's period, corresponding to a Floquet
exponent $\mu=\frac{\pi}{2K(k)}$. The isola instability arises from the
collision of spectral elements at the origin of the spectral plane. (ii) Upon
varying $V_{0}$, the transition between MI and the high-frequency instability
occurs. Differently from the MI and isola instability where the collisions of
eigenvalues happen at the origin, high-frequency instability arises from
pairwise collisions of nonzero, imaginary elements of the stability spectrum;
(iii) In the limit of sinusoidal potential, we show that MI occurs from a
collision of eigenvalues with $\mu=\frac{\pi}{2K(k)}$ at the origin; (iv) we
also examine the dynamic byproducts of the instability in chaotic fields
generated by its manifestation. An interesting observation is that, in addition
to MI, the isola instability could also lead to dark localized events in the
scalar defocusing NLS equation.

Both stars have masses of 1.419 Msun, identical to within 0.2%. Both stars
appear to be in the early red-giant phase of evolution; however, they are far
displaced to cooler temperatures and lower luminosities compared to standard
stellar models. The broadband spectral energy distribution shows NUV excess and
X-ray emission, consistent with chromospheric and coronal emission from
magnetically active stars; indeed, the stars rotate more rapidly than typical
red giants and they evince light curve modulations due to spots. These
modulations also reveal the stars to be rotating synchronously with one
another. There is evidence for excess FUV emission and long-term modulations in
radial-velocities; it is not clear whether these are also attributable to
magnetic activity or if they reveal a tertiary companion. Stellar evolution
models modified to account for the effects of spots can reproduce the observed
radii and temperatures of the RSSs. If the system possesses a white dwarf
tertiary, then mass-transfer scenarios could explain the manner by which the
stars came to possess such remarkably identical masses and by which they came
to be sychronized. However, if the stars are presumed to have been formed as
identical twins, and they managed to become tidally synchronized as they
evolved toward the red giant branch, then all of the features of the system can
be explained via activity effects, without requiring a complex dynamical
history.

proposed to extract unique sensing parameters for XR users and their
environment by exploiting then THz channel sparsity. Essentially, THz band's
quasi-opticality is exploited and the sensing parameters are extracted from the
uplink communication signal, thereby allowing for the use of the same waveform,
spectrum, and hardware for both communication and sensing functionalities.
Then, the Cramer-Rao lower bound is derived to assess the accuracy of the
estimated sensing parameters. Second, a non-autoregressive multi-resolution
generative artificial intelligence (AI) framework integrated with an
adversarial transformer is proposed to predict missing and future sensing
information. The proposed framework offers robust and comprehensive historical
sensing information and anticipatory forecasts of future environmental changes,
which are generalizable to fluctuations in both known and unforeseen user
behaviors and environmental conditions. Third, a multi-agent deep recurrent
hysteretic Q-neural network is developed to control the handover policy of
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) subarrays, leveraging the informative
nature of sensing information to minimize handover cost, maximize the
individual quality of personal experiences (QoPEs), and improve the robustness
and resilience of THz links. Simulation results show a high generalizability of
the proposed unsupervised generative AI framework to fluctuations in user
behavior and velocity, leading to a 61 % improvement in instantaneous
reliability compared to schemes with known channel state information.

the surface code adapted to qubit arrays with arbitrarily distributed defects
to find metrics that characterize how defects affect fidelity. We then
determine the impact of defects on the resource overhead of realizing a
fault-tolerant quantum computer, on a chiplet-based modular architecture. Our
strategy for dealing with fabrication defects demonstrates an exponential
suppression of logical failure where error rates of non-faulty physical qubits
are $\sim 0.1\%$ in a circuit-based noise model. This is a typical regime where
we imagine running the defect-free surface code. We use our numerical results
to establish post-selection criteria for building a device from defective
chiplets. Using our criteria, we then evaluate the resource overhead in terms
of the average number of fabricated physical qubits per logical qubit. We find
that an optimal choice of chiplet size, based on the defect rate and target
fidelity, is essential to limiting any additional error correction overhead due
to defects. When the optimal chiplet size is chosen, at a defect rate of $1\%$
the resource overhead can be reduced to below 3X and 6X respectively for the

Essentially, our theorems quantify precisely the non-trivial property that if

While recently developed kernel-based betting strategies often work well on
simple distributions, selecting a suitable kernel for high-dimensional or

drawback, we design prediction-based betting strategies that rely on the
following fact: if a sequentially updated predictor starts to consistently
determine (a) which distribution an instance is drawn from, or (b) whether an

distributions (the latter produced by external randomization), it provides
evidence against the two-sample or independence nulls respectively. We
empirically demonstrate the superiority of our tests over kernel-based
approaches under structured settings. Our tests can be applied beyond the case

tabulating the stretched flame speed is employed to account for the

The LES-FSD well captures the propagation characteristics during the BLF of
swirling flames. In the LES-FSD for lean CH$_4$/H$_2$/air flames at 2.5 bar,
the critical equivalence ratio for flashback decreases with the increasing
hydrogen volume fraction, consistent with the experiments. This is due to the
improved modeling of effects of the flame stretch and heat loss on the local

GRFs can be used to construct unbiased randomized estimators of several
important kernels defined on graphs' nodes, in particular the regularized
Laplacian kernel. As regular RFs for non-graph kernels, they provide means to
scale up kernel methods defined on graphs to larger networks. Importantly, they
give substantial computational gains also for smaller graphs, while applied in
downstream applications. Consequently, GRFs address the notoriously difficult
problem of cubic (in the number of the nodes of the graph) time complexity of
graph kernels algorithms. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of GRFs
and an extensive empirical evaluation: from speed tests, through Frobenius
relative error analysis to kmeans graph-clustering with graph kernels. We show
that the computation of GRFs admits an embarrassingly simple distributed
algorithm that can be applied if the graph under consideration needs to be
split across several machines. We also introduce a (still unbiased) quasi Monte

predicting parking availability, which seems an indirect approach to saving

parking recommendation (OPR) task to directly recommend a parking space for a
driver. To this end, a learn-to-rank (LTR) based OPR model called OPR-LTR is
built. Specifically, parking recommendation is closely related to the ""turnover
events"" (state switching between occupied and vacant) of each parking space,
and hence we design a highly efficient heterogeneous graph called ESGraph to
represent historical and real-time meters' turnover events as well as
geographical relations; afterward, a convolution-based event-then-graph network
is used to aggregate and update representations of the heterogeneous graph. A
ranking model is further utilized to learn a score function that helps
recommend a list of ranked parking spots for a specific on-street parking
query. The method is verified using the on-street parking meter data in Hong
Kong and San Francisco. By comparing with the other two types of methods:
prediction-only and prediction-then-recommendation, the proposed
direct-recommendation method achieves satisfactory performance in different
metrics. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that the proposed ESGraph and
the recommendation model are more efficient in terms of computational
efficiency as well as saving drivers' on-street parking time.

propagation of information over time. The role of alignment is well-studied for
low-level enhancement in video, but existing works have overlooked one critical
step -- re-sampling. Most works, regardless of how they compensate for motion
between frames, be it flow-based warping or deformable convolution/attention,
use the default choice of bilinear interpolation for re-sampling. However,
bilinear interpolation acts effectively as a low-pass filter and thus hinders
the aim of recovering high-frequency content for super-resolution.
  This paper studies the impact of re-sampling on alignment for video
super-resolution. Extensive experiments reveal that for alignment to be
effective, the re-sampling should preserve the original sharpness of the
features and prevent distortions. From these observations, we propose an
implicit alignment method that re-samples through a window-based
cross-attention with sampling positions encoded by sinusoidal positional
encoding. The re-sampling is implicitly computed by learned network weights.
Experiments show that the proposed implicit alignment enhances the performance
of state-of-the-art frameworks with minimal impact on both synthetic and

of a monolayer is out-of-plane. Band filling and tensile bi-axial strain cause
the magnetic moment of a monolayer to switch from out-of-plane to in-plane, and
compressive bi-axial strain in a bilayer causes the magnetic moment to switch
from in-plane to out-of-plane. The magnetic anisotropy is shown to originate
from the large spin orbit coupling (SOC) of the Te atoms and the anisotropy of
the exchange coupling constants $J_{xy}$ and $J_z$ in an XXZ type Hamiltonian.
Renormalized spin wave theory using experimental values for the magnetic
anisotropy energy and Curie temperatures provides a range of values for the
nearest neighbor exchange coupling.

to improve the efficiency and safety of air traffic control (ATC) operations.
However, the conversation between ATC controllers and pilots using multilingual
speech brings a great challenge to building high-accuracy ASR systems. In this
work, we present a two-stage multilingual ASR framework. The first stage is to
train a language identifier (LID), that based on a recurrent neural network
(RNN) to obtain sentence language identification in the form of one-hot
encoding. The second stage aims to train an RNN-based end-to-end multilingual
recognition model that utilizes sentence language features generated by LID to
enhance input features. In this work, We introduce Featurewise Linear

sentence language identification. Furthermore, we introduce a new sentence
language identification learning module called SLIL, which consists of a FiLM
layer and a Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks layer. Extensive experiments on the
ATCSpeech dataset show that our proposed method outperforms the baseline model.
Compared to the vanilla FiLMed backbone model, the proposed multilingual ASR
model obtains about 7.50% character error rate relative performance

e.g., $k$-median, $k$-means, by imposing additional constraints on the
feasibility of clustering. There has been significant recent progress in
obtaining approximation algorithms for these problems, both in the metric and
the Euclidean settings. However, the outlier version of these problems, where
the solution is allowed to leave out $m$ points from the clustering, is not
well understood. In this work, we give a general framework for reducing the
outlier version of a constrained $k$-median or $k$-means problem to the
corresponding outlier-free version with only $(1+\varepsilon)$-loss in the
approximation ratio. The reduction is obtained by mapping the original instance
of the problem to $f(k,m, \varepsilon)$ instances of the outlier-free version,
where $f(k, m, \varepsilon) = \left( \frac{k+m}{\varepsilon}\right)^{O(m)}$. As
specific applications, we get the following results:
  - First FPT (in the parameters $k$ and $m$) $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation
algorithm for the outlier version of capacitated $k$-median and $k$-means in
Euclidean spaces with hard capacities.
  - First FPT (in the parameters $k$ and $m$) $(3+\varepsilon)$ and

  - First FPT (in the parameters $k$ and $m$) $(2-\delta)$-approximation
algorithm for the outlier version of the $k$-median problem under the Ulam

clustering problems. Further, our reduction works for arbitrary metric spaces
and so can extend clustering algorithms for outlier-free versions in both

the selected sensors. We provide comparisons between the estimation performance

is crucial for online assessment of power system stability and adaptive control
of grid-connected converters. Existing grid impedance measurement approaches
typically rely on pointwise sinusoidal injections or sequential wideband
perturbations to identify a nonparametric grid impedance curve via fast Fourier
computations in the frequency domain. This is not only time-consuming, but also
inaccurate during time-varying grid conditions, while on top of that, the
identified nonparametric model cannot be immediately used for stability
analysis or control design. To tackle these problems, we propose to use
parametric system identification techniques (e.g., prediction error or subspace
methods) to obtain a parametric impedance model directly from time-domain
current and voltage data. Our approach relies on injecting wideband excitation
signals in the converter's controller and allows to accurately identify the
grid impedance in closed loop with one injection and measurement cycle. Even
though the underlying parametric system identification techniques are
well-studied in general, their utilization in a grid impedance identification
setup poses specific challenges, is vastly underexplored, and has not gained
adequate attention in urgent and timely power systems applications. To this
end, we demonstrate in numerical experiments how the proposed parametric
approach can accomplish a significant improvement compared to prevalent
nonparametric methods.

search space, leading to inaccurate point matching of current methods. In
pursuit of a reasonable matching search space, this paper introduces a
hierarchical feature matching framework: Area to Point Matching (A2PM), to
first find semantic area matches between images, and then perform point
matching on area matches, thus setting the search space as the area matches
with salient features to achieve high matching precision. This proper search

the covariates may not have a uniform effect over the whole population and thus
a unified simple model can miss the heterogeneous signal. For example, a linear

the nonlinearity and heterogeneity in the data. In this paper, we propose
DDGroup (data-driven group discovery), a data-driven method to effectively
identify subgroups in the data with a uniform linear relationship between the

linear model is expected to hold. It is simple to implement and computationally
tractable for use. We show theoretically that, given a large enough sample,
DDGroup recovers a region where a single linear model with low variance is
well-specified (if one exists), and experiments on real-world medical datasets
confirm that it can discover regions where a local linear model has improved
performance. Our experiments also show that DDGroup can uncover subgroups with
qualitatively different relationships which are missed by simply applying

large-scale online job search queries and job postings. In particular, we model
the spatial-temporal patterns of labour flow and labour demand which reflect
the attractiveness of regional labour markets. Our analysis shows that regional
labour markets suffered from dramatic changes and demonstrated unusual signs of
recovery during the pandemic. Specifically, the intention of labour flow
quickly recovered with a trend of migrating from large to small cities and from
northern to southern regions, respectively. Meanwhile, due to the pandemic, the

Three main measures that serve as statistical proxies to capture the

statistics. If in addition, reasonable volatility and sparsity for the
portfolio are desired, a convex quadratic or quartic objective function,
subject to nonconvex quadratic and cardinality constraints needs to be
minimized. In this paper, we introduce and investigate a comprehensive modeling
framework that incorporates all the previous proxies proposed in the literature
and develop an effective unifying algorithm that is enabled to obtain a
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point under mild regularity conditions. Specifically,
we present a tailored penalty decomposition method that approximately solves a
sequence of penalized subproblems by a block coordinate descent algorithm. To
the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithm is the first for finding
volatile, sparse, and mean-reverting portfolios based on the portmanteau
criterion and crossing statistics proxies. Further, we establish that the
convergence analysis can be extended to a nonconvex objective function case if
the starting penalty parameter is larger than a finite bound and the objective
function has a bounded level set. Numerical experiments on the S&P 500 data set

$\Omega_m=0.282_{-0.023}^{+0.024}$ from our AP test alone, which is

designs from a wide range of existing ship types, including container ships,
tankers, bulk carriers, tugboats, and crew supply vessels. We developed a new
shape extraction and representation strategy to convert all training designs
into a common geometric representation of the same resolution, as typically
GANs can only accept vectors of fixed dimension as input. A space-filling layer
is placed right after the generator component to ensure that the trained
generator can cover all design classes. During training, designs are provided
in the form of a shape-signature tensor (SST) which harnesses the compact
geometric representation using geometric moments that further enable the
inexpensive incorporation of physics-informed elements in ship design. We have
shown through extensive comparative studies and optimisation cases that
ShipHullGAN can generate designs with augmented features resulting in versatile
design spaces that produce traditional and novel designs with geometrically
valid and practically feasible shapes.

combines theoretical and experimental investigations of nanometer-scale
AlGaN/GaN grating-gate structures and reveals that all terahertz (THz)
plasmonic resonances in these structures can be explained only within the
framework of the plasmonic crystal model. We identify two different plasmonic
crystal phases. The first is the delocalized phase, where THz radiation
interacts with the entire grating-gate structure that is realized at a weakly
modulated 2D electron gas (2DEG) regime. In the second, the localized phase,
THz radiation interacts only with the ungated portions of the structure. This
phase is achieved by fully depleting the gated regions, resulting in strong
modulation. By gate-controlling of the modulation degree, we observe a
continuous transition between these phases. We also discovered that
unexpectedly the resonant plasma frequencies of ungated parts (in the localized
phase) still depend on the gate voltage. We attribute this phenomenon to the
specific depletion of the conductive profile in the ungated region of the 2DEG,
the so-called edge gating effect. Although we study a specific case of plasmons
in AlGaN/GaN grating-gate structures, our results have a general character and
are applicable to any other semiconductor-based plasmonic crystal structures.
Our work represents the first demonstration of an electrically tunable
transition between different phases of THz plasmonic crystals, which is a
crucial step towards a deeper understanding of THz plasma physics and the
development of all-electrically tunable devices for THz optoelectronics.

been considered for testing heavy quarks' thermalisation in the hot, dense

correlations due to the quark-anti-quark pair creation dynamics, there are
other important sources of momentum correlations, which allow us to explore the
rich physics of heavy-ion collisions further.
  Here we show significant momentum correlations even in the thermalisation of
charm quarks in the expanding medium, and this effect can be measured in
collisions at sufficiently low energies.
  The momentum correlations depend on the correlations in the configuration
space, more specifically, on the spatial separation between charm and
anti-charm hadrons emission points. The pair production locality and spatial
diffusion of the charm quarks give the latter. Using an example of central
Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN SPS energies, we show that future measurements of
the azimuthal correlations of charm and anti-charm hadrons should allow us to
distinguish between different assumptions on their spatial correlations.
  This provides a unique window into a poorly understood sector of particle
production at high-energy densities. The measurements can help to constrain the
diffusion of charm quarks and verify assumptions concerning production locality
of a charm and ant-charm quark pair.

amount of fluid through a straight duct in a given time interval can be reduced
by modulating in time the pumping power. The control strategy is hybrid: it is
passive, as it requires neither a control system nor control energy, but it
manipulates how pumping energy is delivered to the system (as in active
techniques) to increase the pumping efficiency. Our control employs a
temporally periodic pumping pattern, where a short and intense acceleration (in
which the pumping system is on) followed by a longer deceleration (in which the
pumping system is off) makes the flow alternately visit a quasi-laminar and a
turbulent state. The computational study is for a plane channel flow, and
employs direct numerical simulations, which present specific computational
challenges, for example the highly varying instantaneous value of the Reynolds
number, and the importance of discretisation effects. Particular care is
devoted to a meaningful definition of drag reduction in the present context.
The ability of the forcing to yield significant savings is demonstrated. Since
only a small portion of the parameter space is investigated, the best
performance of the control technique remains to be assessed.

to the properties of the distribution of local energy barriers at zero

heterogeneities and avalanche-type relaxation associated to dynamic
facilitation, allowing us to relate the size distribution of heterogeneities to
their time evolution. Within an avalanche, a local region relaxes multiple
times, the more the larger is the avalanche. This property, related to the

mass creation. Second, it helps to preserve the smoothness of the free surface

inflationary Hubble parameter in $k$-space. We compare our results with

results. Our estimated values of $n_s$ and $r$ lie within $68\%$ CL with
respect to Planck data for $k=0.001 - 0.009$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for all values of
$\alpha$. The $\alpha$ values, obtained in our calculations satisfy various
post inflationary constraints regarding preheating and reheating, reported in
current literature. We observe that quintessence sets an upper bound of
$\alpha=4.3$ and thereby restricts the model from becoming of the power law
type, making it more efficacious than ordinary $\alpha$-attractors in
explaining both inflation and dark energy. A striking observation in our
analyses is that, unlike in our previous study, we find a continuous values of

problems, we are once again discussing the consequences of an oversmoothing
penalty term. This means in our model that the searched-for solution of the
considered nonlinear operator equation does not belong to the domain of
definition of the penalty functional. In the past years, such variational
regularization has been investigated comprehensively in Hilbert scales, but
rarely in a Banach space setting. Our present results try to establish a
theoretical justification of oversmoothing regularization in Banach scales.
This new study includes convergence rates results for a priori and a posteriori
choices of the regularization parameter, both for H\""older-type smoothness and
low order-type smoothness. An illustrative example is intended to indicate the
specificity of occurring non-reflexive Banach spaces.

computational approaches are necessary to efficiently search for optimal
solutions. In this paper, we enable the free-form inverse design in 3D of
linear optical materials with arbitrary dispersion and anisotropy. This is
achieved by implementing the adjoint method based on the complex-conjugate
pole-residue pair model within a parallel finite-difference time-domain solver,
suitable for high-performance computing systems. Our method is tested on the
canonical nanophotonic problem of field enhancement in a gap region. The
obtained free-form designs of metallic and dielectric materials satisfy the
fundamental curiosity of how optimized nanostructures look like in 3D.
Unconventional free-form designs revealed by our method, although may be
challenging or unfeasible with current technology, bring new insight into how
light interacts with nanostructures, and could provide new ideas to inspire
forward design.

that Cu2Se crystals exhibit optically and electrically controllable robust

Vocal breath sound (VBS) based analysis can be an alternative to spirometry as
VBS characteristics change depending on the lung condition. VBS test consumes
less time, and it also requires less effort, unlike spirometry. In this work,
VBS characteristics are analyzed before and after administering bronchodilator
in a subject-dependent manner using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We find
that features learned through LDA show a significant difference between VBS
recorded before and after administering bronchodilator in all 30 subjects
considered in this work, whereas the baseline features could achieve a
significant difference between VBS only for 26 subjects. We also observe that
all frequency ranges do not contribute equally to the discrimination between
pre and post bronchodilator conditions. From experiments, we find that two
frequency ranges, namely 400-500Hz and 1480-1900Hz, maximally contribute to the
discrimination of all the subjects. The study presented in this paper analyzes
the pre and post-bronchodilator effect on the inhalation sound recorded at the
mouth in a subject-dependent manner. The findings of this work suggest that,
inhalation sound recorded at mouth can be a good stimulus to discriminate pre

pre and post-bronchodilator discrimination can be of potential use in clinical
settings.

clinical benefits of early diagnosis. The holy grail of such approaches is the
free-living scenario, in which data are collected continuously and
unobtrusively during every day life. However, obtaining fine-grained
ground-truth and remaining unobtrusive is a contradiction and therefore, the
problem is usually addressed via multiple-instance learning. Yet for large
scale studies, obtaining even the necessary coarse ground-truth is not trivial,
as a complete neurological evaluation is required. In contrast, large scale
collection of data without any ground-truth is much easier. Nevertheless,
utilizing unlabelled data in a multiple-instance setting is not
straightforward, as the topic has received very little research attention. Here
we try to fill this gap by introducing a new method for combining
semi-supervised with multiple-instance learning. Our approach builds on the
Virtual Adversarial Training principle, a state-of-the-art approach for regular
semi-supervised learning, which we adapt and modify appropriately for the

approach through proof-of-concept experiments on synthetic problems generated
from two well-known benchmark datasets. We then move on to the actual task of
detecting PD tremor from hand acceleration signals collected in-the-wild, but
in the presence of additional completely unlabelled data. We show that by
leveraging the unlabelled data of 454 subjects we can achieve large performance
gains (up to 9% increase in F1-score) in per-subject tremor detection for a

a population affects the state of risk, while the risk in turn influences
individuals' behavioral decision-making. Importantly, we explore two
representative feedback forms describing the possible effect of strategy on
risk, namely, linear and exponential feedbacks. We find that cooperation can be
maintained in the population by keeping at a certain fraction or forming an
evolutionary oscillation with risk, independently of the feedback type.
However, such evolutionary outcome depends on the initial state. Taken
together, a two-way coupling between collective actions and risk is essential
to avoid the tragedy of the commons. More importantly, a critical starting
portion of cooperators and risk level is what we really need for guiding the
evolution toward a desired direction.

the dual exchange method in the LSIP literature to solve it. SI-CPO is a policy

mechanical properties, dominated by the dramatically non-linear stress-strain

study the classical Hertz indentation problem in such a material.
Experimentally, we find that polydomain nematic elastomers display a smaller
exponent than the classical 3/2 in the load vs. indentation depth response.
This is puzzling: asymptotically a softer stress-strain response requires a
larger exponent at small loads. We resolve this by theory where three regimes
are identified -- an initial elastic regime for shallow indentation that is
obscured in experiment, an intermediate regime where local domain pattern
evolution leads to a smaller scaling in agreement with experiments, and a final
stiffening regime where the completion of local domain evolution returns the
response to elastic. This three-regime structure is universal, but the
intermediate exponent is not. We discuss how our work reveals a new mechanism
of enhanced adhesion for pressure-sensitive adhesion of nematic elastomers.

detected. A systematic decrease in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
temperatures around nearby large spiral galaxies points to an unknown
interaction with CMB photons in a sphere up to several projected Mpc around
these galaxies. We investigate to which extent this foreground may impact the
CMB fluctuations map and create the so-called CMB anomalies. Using the observed
temperature decrements around the galaxies, and making some general assumptions
about the unknown interaction, we propose a common radial temperature profile.
By assigning this profile to nearby galaxies in the redshift range
$z=[0.004,0.02]$ we create a foreground map model. We find a remarkable
resemblance between this temperature model map based on nearby galaxies and the
Planck CMB map. Out of 1000 simulated maps, none of them show such a strong
correlation with the foreground map over both large and small angular scales.
In particular, the quadrupole, octopole, as well as $\ell=4$ and $\ell=5$ modes
correlate with the foreground map to high significance. Furthermore, one of the
most prominent temperature decrements in the foreground map coincides with the
position of the CMB cold spot. The largest scales of the CMB and thereby the
cosmological parameters, may have important changes after proper corrections of
this foreground component. However, reliable CMB corrected maps can only be

the complex interactions among the cables and the possibility of severe

present a new approach to address this problem using the theory of braids. By
establishing a topological equivalence between the physical cables and the
space-time trajectories of the robots, and identifying particular braid
patterns that emerge from the entangled trajectories, we obtain the key finding
that all complex entanglements stem from a finite number of interaction
patterns between 2 or 3 robots. Hence, non-entanglement can be guaranteed by
avoiding these interaction patterns in the trajectories of the robots. Based on
this finding, we present a graph search algorithm using the permutation grid to
efficiently search for a feasible topology of paths and reject braid patterns
that result in an entanglement. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can
achieve 100% goal-reaching capability without entanglement for up to 10 drones

  Supplementary Material",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fe-based metallic glasses are promising functional materials for advanced
magnetism and sensor fields. Tailoring magnetic performance in amorphous
materials requires a thorough knowledge of the correlation between structural
disorder and magnetic order, which remains ambiguous. Two practical
difficulties remain: the first is directly observing subtle magnetic structural
changes on multiple scales, and the second is precisely regulating the various
amorphous states. Here we propose a novel approach to tailor the amorphous
structure through the liquid liquid phase transition. In-situ synchrotron
diffraction has unraveled a medium-range ordering process dominated by
edge-sharing cluster connectivity during the liquid-liquid phase transition.
Moreover, nanodomains with topological order have been found to exist in
composition with liquid-liquid phase transition, manifesting as hexagonal
patterns in small-angle neutron scattering profiles. The liquid-liquid phase
transition can induce the nanodomains to be more locally ordered, generating
stronger exchange interactions due to the reduced Fe-Fe bond and the enhanced
structural order, leading to the increment of saturation magnetization.
Furthermore, the increased local heterogeneity in the medium range scale
enhances the magnetic anisotropy, promoting the permeability response under
applied stress and leading to a better stress-impedance effect. These
experimental results pave the way to tailor the magnetic structure and
performance through the liquid-liquid phase transition.

the nanoscale. From the first-principles electronic structure perspective, one
of the outstanding problems is accurately and efficiently calculating how the
frontier quasiparticle levels of one component are aligned in energy with those
of another at the interface, i.e., the so-called interfacial band alignment or
level alignment. The alignment or the energy offset of these frontier levels is
associated with the charge-transfer barrier across the interface and therefore
dictates the interfacial dynamics. Although many-body perturbation theory
provides a formally rigorous framework for computing the interfacial electronic
structure, it is often associated with a high computational cost and is limited
by its perturbative nature. It is therefore of great interest to develop
practical alternatives, preferably based on density functional theory (DFT),
which is known for its balance between efficiency and accuracy. However,
conventional developments of density functionals largely focus on total
energies and thermodynamic properties, and the design of functionals aiming for
interfacial electronic structure is only emerging recently. This Review is
dedicated to a self-contained narrative of the interfacial electronic structure
problem and the efforts of the DFT community in tackling it. Since interfaces
are closely related to surfaces, we first discuss the key physics behind the
surface and interface electronic structure, namely the image potential and the
gap renormalization. This is followed by a review of early examinations of the
surface exchange-correlation hole and the exchange-correlation potential, which
are central quantities in DFT. Lastly, we survey two modern endeavors in
functional development that focus on the interfacial electronic structure,

Newtonian fluid with a spatially varying viscosity field. The fluid is at zero
Reynolds number, and the viscosity varies linearly in space in an arbitrary
direction with respect to the external force. First, we obtain the correction
to the spheroid's rigid body motion in the limit of small viscosity gradients,
using a perturbation expansion combined with the reciprocal theorem. Next, we
determine the general form of the particle's mobility tensor relating its rigid
body motion to an external force and torque. The viscosity gradient does not
alter the force/translation and torque/rotation relationships, but introduces
new force/rotation and torque/translation couplings that are determined for a
wide range of particle aspect ratios. Finally, we discuss results for the
spheroid's rotation and center-of-mass trajectory during sedimentation.
Depending on the viscosity gradient direction and particle shape, a steady
orientation may arise at long times or the particle may tumble continuously.
These results are significantly different from the case when no viscosity
gradient is present, where the particle stays at its initial orientation for
all times. The particle's center of mass trajectory can also be altered
depending on the particle's orientation behavior, for example giving rise to
diagonal motion or zig-zagging motion. We summarize the observations for
prolate and oblate spheroids for different viscosity gradient directions and
provide phase plots delineating different dynamical regimes. We also provide
guidelines to extend the analysis when the viscosity gradient exhibits a more
complicated spatial behavior.

distributions that are parametric and stationary, and does not consider
out-of-distribution tasks during the evaluation, thus, restricting its
application. In this paper, we propose MoSS, a context-based Meta-reinforcement

address this challenge. We extend meta-RL to broad non-parametric task
distributions which have never been explored before, and also achieve
state-of-the-art results in non-stationary and out-of-distribution tasks.
Specifically, MoSS consists of a task inference module and a policy module. We
utilize the Gaussian mixture model for task representation to imitate the
parametric and non-parametric task variations. Additionally, our online
adaptation strategy enables the agent to react at the first sight of a task
change, thus being applicable in non-stationary tasks. MoSS also exhibits
strong generalization robustness in out-of-distributions tasks which benefits
from the reliable and robust task representation. The policy is built on top of
an off-policy RL algorithm and the entire network is trained completely
off-policy to ensure high sample efficiency. On MuJoCo and Meta-World

determination method based on principle component analysis (PCA), which
segments the points into four even quarters and compare their minimum

conservative dynamical systems with phase space dimensionality higher than two.
In particular, we consider the recently introduced methods of the difference
($D_L^n$) and the ratio ($R_L^n$) of the LDs of neighboring orbits, as well as
a quantity ($S_L^n$) related to the finite-difference second spatial derivative
of the LDs, and use them to determine the chaotic or regular nature of
ensembles of orbits of a prototypical area-preserving map model, the
4-dimensional (4D) symplectic standard map. Using the distributions of the
indices' values we determine appropriate thresholds to discriminate between
regular and chaotic orbits, and compare the obtained characterization against
that achieved by the Smaller Alignment Index (SALI) method of chaos detection,
by recording the percentage agreement $P_A$ between the two classifications. We
study the influence of various factors on the performance of these indices, and
show that the increase of the final number of orbit iterations T and the order
n of the indices (i.e. the dimensionality of the space where the considered
nearby orbits lie), as well as the decrease of the distance $\sigma$ of
neighboring orbits, increase the $P_A$ values along with the required
computational effort. Balancing between these two factors we find appropriate
T, n and $\sigma$ values, which allow the efficient use of the $D_L^n$, $R_L^n$
and $S_L^n$ indices as short time and computationally cheap chaos diagnostics
achieving $P_A \gtrsim 90 \%$, with $D_L^n$ and $S_L^n$ having larger $P_A$
values than $R_L^n$. Our results show that the three LDs-based indices perform
better for systems with large percentages of chaotic orbits.

X-rays emitted from hydrogen-like magnesium, silicon ($\Delta E/E_{\rm rest}

of the WD mass measurement by invoking the plasma-flow theory with strong

recently shown great success in molecular relational learning by modeling a
molecule as a graph structure, and considering atom-level interactions between
two molecules. Despite their success, existing molecular relational learning
methods tend to overlook the nature of chemistry, i.e., a chemical compound is
composed of multiple substructures such as functional groups that cause
distinctive chemical reactions. In this work, we propose a novel relational
learning framework, called CGIB, that predicts the interaction behavior between
a pair of graphs by detecting core subgraphs therein. The main idea is, given a
pair of graphs, to find a subgraph from a graph that contains the minimal
sufficient information regarding the task at hand conditioned on the paired
graph based on the principle of conditional graph information bottleneck. We
argue that our proposed method mimics the nature of chemical reactions, i.e.,
the core substructure of a molecule varies depending on which other molecule it
interacts with. Extensive experiments on various tasks with real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of CGIB over state-of-the-art baselines. Our code

by claiming that it violates the equivalence principle and breaks the CPT
invariance of quantum gravity. He proposed that the final result of the
gravitational collapse should not be an event horizon, but an apparent horizon
instead. On the other hand, Hawking did not give a mechanism for how this could
work. In the same year, Vaz endorsed Hawking's proposal in a quantum
gravitational model of dust collapse by winning the Second Prize in the 2014
Gravity Research Foundation Essay Competition. He indeed showed that continued
collapse to a singularity can only be obtained if one combines two independent
and entire solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Vaz's interpretation of
the paradox was in terms of simply forbidding such a combination. This leads
naturally to matter condensing on the apparent horizon during quantum collapse.
In that way, an entirely new framework for black holes (BHs) has emerged. The
approach of Vaz was also consistent with Einstein's idea in 1939 of the
localization of the collapsing particles within a thin spherical shell. In this
work we derive the BH mass and energy spectra via a Schrodinger-like approach,
by further supporting Vaz's conclusions that instead of a spacetime singularity
covered by an event horizon, the final result of the gravitational collapse is
an essentially quantum object, an extremely compact ""dark star"". This
""gravitational atom"" is held up not by any degeneracy pressure but by quantum
gravity in the same way that ordinary atoms are sustained by quantum mechanics.
Finally, by evoking the generalized uncertainty principle, the maximum value of
the density of Vaz's shell will be estimated.

organisms as the vast majority of oxygen in the blood is bound to the
hemoglobin molecules in their cytosol. Healthy RBCs have a biconcave shape and
a flexible membrane enabling them to undergo substantial reversible elastic
deformation as they traverse narrow capillaries during microcirculation. This
RBC deformability is critical for efficient circulation while the unique
biconcave shape of healthy RBCs is attributed to their specific volume, which
affects the amount of oxygen they can carry. However, despite extensive
research, the underlying mechanism that determines the optimal RBC volume
remains unknown. This paper examines the impact of RBC volume on the efficiency
of oxygen transport from a fluid dynamics standpoint. Our investigation reveals
that RBCs with volumes similar to those observed in vivo demonstrate superior
oxygen transport efficiency in circular tubes similar to arterioles, which
represent areas of the circulatory system with the highest flow resistance.
Furthermore, we identify mechanisms that impair oxygen transport when the RBC
volume deviates from the optimal value. While healthy RBCs produce a maximum
cell-free layer thickness that affects flow dissipation, smaller RBC volumes
result in greater deformations and thus dissipate more energy. Strikingly, the
flow resistance is minimized at the reduced volume of healthy RBCs. Our study
highlights that the volume of healthy RBCs maximizes oxygen transport
efficiency and may offer insight into developing targeted treatments for
circulatory disorders.

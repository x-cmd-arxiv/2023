an extensive and labeled ocean bottom seismometer dataset from 15 deployments

two popular deep learning networks EQTransformer and PhaseNet. PickBlue joint
processes three seismometer recordings in conjunction with a hydrophone
component and is trained with the waveforms in the new database. The
performance is enhanced by employing transfer learning, where initial weights
are derived from models trained with land earthquake data. PickBlue
significantly outperforms neural networks trained with land stations and models
trained without hydrophone data. The model achieves a mean absolute deviation
(MAD) of 0.05 s for P waves and 0.12 s for S waves. We integrate our dataset

better AV cities is not a process of matching city designs and policies with
AVs' technological innovations, but a process of iterative prototyping of all
three simultaneously: Innovations can happen step-wise as the knot of AV, city,
and policy design loosens and tightens, unwinds and reties. In this paper, we
ask: How can innovators innovate AVs, city environments, and policies
simultaneously and productively toward better AV cities? The paper has two
parts. First, we map out the interconnections among the many AV, city, and
policy design decisions, based on a literature review spanning HCI/HRI,
transportation science, urban studies, law and policy, operations research,
economy, and philosophy. This map can help innovators identify design
constraints and opportunities across the traditional AV/city/policy design
disciplinary bounds. Second, we review the respective methods for AV, city, and
policy design, and identify key barriers in combining them: (1) Organizational
barriers to AV-city-policy design collaboration, (2) computational barriers to
multi-granularity AV-city-policy simulation, and (3) different assumptions and
goals in joint AV-city-policy optimization. We discuss two broad approaches

for a large sample of 173 `active' galaxies (LINERs and Seyferts) and
`inactive' galaxies (H IIs and absorption line galaxies, ALGs). Dividing our
sample into active and inactive, they define distinct (radio core

at M_*, bulge ~ 10^(9.8 +- 0.3) M_sun (supermassive black hole mass M_BH ~
10^(6.8 +- 0.3) M_sun), which marks the transition from AGN-dominated nuclear
radio emission in more massive bulges to that mainly driven by stellar
processes in low-mass bulges. None of our 10/173 bulgeless galaxies host an
AGN. The AGN fraction increases with increasing M_*, bulge such that
f_optical_AGN $\propto$ M_*,bulge^(0.24 +- 0.06) and f_radio_AGN $\propto$

f_optical_AGN steadily rises from 15 +- 4 to 80 +- 5 per cent. We find that at
fixed bulge mass, the radio loudness, nuclear radio activity and the (optical

preferentially possess an early-type morphology than radio-quiet hosts, the two
types are however indistinguishable in terms of bulge S\'ersic index and
ellipticity, while results on the bulge inner logarithmic profile slope are
inconclusive. We finally discuss the importance of bulge mass in determining
the AGN triggering processes, including potential implications for the nuclear
radio emission in nearby galaxies.

finite characterisation of a modal formula $\varphi$ is a finite collection of

structure. This definition can be restricted to specific frame classes and to
fragments of the modal language: a modal fragment $L$ admits finite
characterisations with respect to a frame class $F$ if every formula
$\varphi\in L$ has a finite characterisation with respect to $L$ consting of

high-quality sentence embeddings with an appropriate word selection method, can
generate better topics than generative probabilistic topic models. However,
these approaches suffer from the inability to select appropriate parameters and
incomplete models that overlook the quantitative relation between words with
topics and topics with text. To solve these issues, we propose graph to topic
(G2T), a simple but effective framework for topic modelling. The framework is
composed of four modules. First, document representation is acquired using
pretrained language models. Second, a semantic graph is constructed according
to the similarity between document representations. Third, communities in
document semantic graphs are identified, and the relationship between topics
and documents is quantified accordingly. Fourth, the word--topic distribution
is computed based on a variant of TFIDF. Automatic evaluation suggests that G2T
achieved state-of-the-art performance on both English and Chinese documents
with different lengths.

proteomics data. While the field is still actively debating on the best

spectrometry-based single-cell proteomics and the dramatic increase in missing
values. A popular approach to deal with missing values is to perform
imputation. Imputation has several drawbacks for which alternatives exist, but
currently imputation is still a practical solution widely adopted in
single-cell proteomics data analysis. This perspective discusses the advantages
and drawbacks of imputation. We also highlight 5 main challenges linked to
missing value management in single-cell proteomics. Future developments should
aim to solve these challenges, whether it is through imputation or data
modelling. The perspective concludes with recommendations for reporting missing
values, for reporting methods that deal with missing values and for proper

the KESPRINT follow-up program of TESS planets carried out with the HARPS

suggest that TOI-733 b has a volatile-enriched, most likely secondary outer

edge-connectivity requirements. This encompasses uniform demands such as the
Minimum $k$-Edge-Connected Spanning Subgraph problem as well as nonuniform
demands such as the Survivable Network Design problem (SND). In a recent paper
by [Dinitz, Koranteng, Kortsarz APPROX '22] , the authors observed that a
weakness of these formulations is that it does not enable one to consider
fault-tolerance in graphs that have just one small cut. To remedy this, they
introduced new variants of these problems under the notion ""relative""
fault-tolerance. Informally, this requires not that two nodes are connected if
there are a bounded number of faults (as in the classical setting), but that
two nodes are connected if there are a bounded number of faults and the two
nodes are connected in the underlying graph post-faults. The problem is already
highly non-trivial even for the case of a single demand.
  Due to difficulties introduced by this new notion of fault-tolerance, the
results in [Dinitz, Koranteng, Kortsarz APPROX '22] are quite limited. For the
Relative Survivable Network Design problem (RSND), when the demands are not
uniform they give a nontrivial result only when there is a single demand with a
connectivity requirement of $3$: a non-optimal $27/4$-approximation. We
strengthen this result in two significant ways: We give a $2$-approximation for
RSND where all requirements are at most $3$, and a $2^{O(k^2)}$-approximation
for RSND with a single demand of arbitrary value $k$. To achieve these results,
we first use the ""cactus representation'' of minimum cuts to give a lossless
reduction to normal SND. Second, we extend the techniques of [Dinitz,
Koranteng, Kortsarz APPROX '22] to prove a generalized and more complex version
of their structure theorem, which we then use to design a recursive
approximation algorithm.

antipairing effects on the systematic of the spontaneous fission half-lives for
the nuclei $^{240-250}$Cm and $^{240-250}$Cf is analyzed, using a hierarchy of
approximations based on the parametrization D1M of the Gogny energy density
functional (EDF). First, the constrained Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB)
approximation is used to compute deformed mean-field configurations, zero-point
quantum corrections and collective inertias either by using the Slater
approximation to Coulomb exchange and neglecting Coulomb antipairing or by
fully considering the exchange and pairing channels of the Coulomb interaction.
Next, the properties of the {\it{least action}} and {\it{least energy}} fission
paths are compared. In the {\it{least action}} case, pairing is identified as
the relevant degree of freedom in order to minimize the action entering the
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation to the tunneling probability
through the fission barrier. Irrespective of the treatment of Coulomb exchange
and antipairing, it is shown that the {\it{least action}} path obtained taking
into account the pairing degree of freedom leads to stronger pairing
correlations that significantly reduce the spontaneous fission half-lives
$t_{SF}$ improving thereby the comparison with the experiment by several orders
of magnitude. It is also shown that the Coulomb antipairing effect is, to a
large extent, washed out by the {\it{least action}} procedure and therefore the
$t_{SF}$ values obtained by the two different treatments of the Coulomb
exchange and pairing are of similar quality.

galaxies at redshifts up to $z_\mathrm{spec}=13.20$ in the literature, we make
a sample of 25 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in total and carefully
derive the best estimates and lower limits of the UV luminosity functions.
These UV luminosity function constraints are consistent with the previous
photometric estimates within the uncertainties and indicate mild redshift
evolution towards z~12 showing tensions with some theoretical models of rapid
evolution. With these spectroscopic constraints, we obtain firm lower limits of
the cosmic SFR densities and spectroscopically confirm a high SFR density at
z~12 beyond the constant star-formation efficiency models, which supports
earlier claims from the photometric studies. While there are no
spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies with very large stellar masses violating
the $\Lambda$CDM model due to the removal of the bright interloper, we confirm
star-forming galaxies at $z_\mathrm{spec}=11-13$ with stellar masses much
higher than model predictions. Our results indicate possibilities of high
star-formation efficiency (>5%), hidden AGN, top-heavy initial mass function
(possibly with Pop-III), and large scatter/variance. Having these successful
and unsuccessful spectroscopy results, we suggest observational strategies for
efficiently removing low redshift interlopers for future JWST programs.

Simulations of star formation on molecular cloud scales typically start with a
turbulent cloud of gas, from which stars form and then undergo feedback. In
reality, a typical cloud or region within a galaxy may already include, or
reside near some population of stars containing massive stars undergoing
feedback. We find the main role of a prior population is triggering star
formation, and contributing to gas dynamics. Early time supernova from the
initial population are important in triggering new star formation and driving
gas motions on larger scales above 100 pc, whilst the ionising feedback
contribution from the initial population has less impact, since many members of
the initial population have cleared out gas around them in the prior model. In
terms of overall star formation rates though, the initial population has a
relatively small effect, and the feedback does not for example suppress
subsequent star formation. We find that MHD has a relatively larger impact than
initial conditions, reducing the star formation rate by a factor of 3 at later
times.

particular, when fitting deterministic models to estimate the rate of spread,
we do not account for the stochastic nature of epidemics and that, given the

an observed epidemic that we wish to control is a major outbreak. This amounts
to implicit selection for major outbreaks which leads to the over-estimation

precision observables provide the strongest constraints on the triplet model.
In the singlet model the present di-Higgs constraints already play a
significant role. We find that the current constraints on model parameters are
already competitive with those anticipated from future di- and tri-Higgs
measurements. We compare our results with calculations in the full model,
exhibiting the improvements when higher-order SMEFT terms are included. We also
identify regions in parameter space where the SMEFT approximation appears to

simultaneously satisfied. The past ten years have seen a number of works in
this area, and this thesis includes both expository material and novel
contributions. Throughout, we emphasize connections to the broader theories of
CSPs, approximability, and streaming models, and highlight interesting open
problems.
  The first part of our thesis is expository: We present aspects of previous
works that completely characterize the approximability of specific CSPs like
Max-Cut and Max-Dicut with $\sqrt{n}$-space streaming algorithm (on
$n$-variable instances), while characterizing the approximability of all CSPs
in $\sqrt n$ space in the special case of ""composable"" (i.e., sketching)
algorithms, and of a particular subclass of CSPs with linear-space streaming
algorithms.

linear-space streaming approximation-resistance for all ordering CSPs (OCSPs),
which are ""CSP-like"" problems maximizing over sets of permutations. Next, we
present joint work with Joanna Boyland, Michael Hwang, Tarun Prasad, and

dynamics, while the links are subject to strongly sign-preserving odd nonlinear
conditions. Logarithmic quantization and clipping (saturation) are two examples
of such nonlinearities. In contrast to existing literature that mostly
considers ideal links and perfect information exchange over linear channels, we
show how general sector-bounded models affect the convergence to the optimizer

any odd sector-bounded nonlinear mapping can be applied to our dynamics. The
main challenge is to show that the proposed system dynamics always have one
zero eigenvalue (associated with the consensus) and the other eigenvalues all
have negative real parts. This is done by recalling arguments from matrix
perturbation theory. Then, the solution is shown to converge to the agreement
state under certain conditions. For example, the gradient tracking (GT) step
size is tighter than the linear case by factors related to the upper/lower
sector bounds. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work in distributed

IterInpaint, a new baseline that generates foreground and background regions in

which limits practical trading strategies. This study introduces realistic
constraints, such as transaction and holding costs, into an optimisation model.
Due to the non-convex nature of this problem, metaheuristic algorithms, such as
NSGA-II, R-NSGA-II, NSGA-III and U-NSGA-III, will play a vital role in solving
the problem. Furthermore, a learnheuristic approach is taken as surrogate
models enhance the metaheuristics employed. These algorithms are then compared
to the baseline metaheuristic algorithms, which solve a constrained,

of this study show that, despite taking significantly longer to run to
completion, the learnheuristic algorithms outperform the baseline algorithms in
terms of hypervolume and rate of convergence. Furthermore, the backtesting
results indicate that utilising learnheuristics to generate weights for asset

Convergence of the hyperspherical cluster harmonics expansion is studied for

experimentally that for a prototypical system, a ferrocene terminated alkane

coupling of charge transfer to a specific solvent motion and more generally
imply that solvent may affect reduction/oxidation rates in electrocatalysis by
coupling to a few distinct solvent motions. Identifying these motions is

for constructing distance ladders to measure the Hubble constant. In practice
its measurements via edge-detection response (EDR) are complicated by the
apparent fuzziness of the tip and the multi-peak landscape of the EDR. As a
result, it can be difficult to replicate due to a case-by-case measurement
process. Previously we optimized an unsupervised algorithm, Comparative
Analysis of TRGBs (CATs), to minimize the variance among multiple halo fields
per host without reliance on individualized choices, achieving state-of-the-art
$\sim$ $<$ 0.05 mag distance measures for optimal data. Further, we found an
empirical correlation at 5$\sigma$ confidence in the GHOSTS halo survey between
our measurements of the tip and their contrast ratios (ratio of stars 0.5 mag
just below and above the tip), useful for standardizing the apparent tips at
different host locations. Here, we apply this algorithm to an expanded sample
of SN Ia hosts to standardize these to multiple fields in the geometric anchor,
NGC 4258. In concert with the Pantheon$+$ SN Ia sample, this analysis produces
a (baseline) result of $H_0= 73.22 \pm 2.06$ km/s/Mpc. The largest difference
in $H_0$ between this and similar studies employing the TRGB derives from
corrections for SN survey differences and local flows used in most recent SN Ia
compilations but which were absent in earlier studies. SN-related differences
total $\sim$ 2.0 km/s/Mpc. A smaller share, $\sim$ 1.4 km/s/Mpc, results from
the inhomogeneity of the TRGB calibration across the distance ladder. We employ
a grid of 108 variants around the optimal TRGB algorithm and find the median of
variants is $72.94\pm1.98$ km/s/Mpc with an additional uncertainty due to
algorithm choices of 0.83 km/s/Mpc. None of these TRGB variants result in $H_0$
less than 71.6 km/s/Mpc.

Another key challenge lies in the robust up-sampling of burst frames. The

$2d$, then it has a variable with influence at least $Var[p]^2$.

advanced the development of deep learning. However, the state-of-the-art models

only in the tens of millions. Further scaling them up to higher orders of
magnitude is rarely explored. An overarching goal of exploring large-scale
models is to train them on large-scale medical segmentation datasets for better
transfer capacities. In this work, we design a series of Scalable and
Transferable U-Net (STU-Net) models, with parameter sizes ranging from 14
million to 1.4 billion. Notably, the 1.4B STU-Net is the largest medical image
segmentation model to date. Our STU-Net is based on nnU-Net framework due to
its popularity and impressive performance. We first refine the default
convolutional blocks in nnU-Net to make them scalable. Then, we empirically
evaluate different scaling combinations of network depth and width, discovering
that it is optimal to scale model depth and width together. We train our
scalable STU-Net models on a large-scale TotalSegmentator dataset and find that
increasing model size brings a stronger performance gain. This observation
reveals that a large model is promising in medical image segmentation.
Furthermore, we evaluate the transferability of our model on 14 downstream

solve this problem, our key idea is to represent the radiance field of each

called MLP maps, and dynamically predicted by a 2D CNN decoder shared by all

rendering speed, while dynamically predicting MLP parameters with a shared 2D

work out the quantum partition function, from which the thermodynamics of the
system follows, we use the Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity
that identifies the path integral of the gravitational system with the
partition function. In a semiclassical approximation, one needs only to compute
the classical action of the system. Then, one finds that the total entropy,
i.e., the sum of black hole and matter entropies, is a function of the
gravitational radius of the system alone. So, the black hole inside the shell
has no direct influence on the entropy. One also finds the free energy, the
thermodynamic energy, and the temperature stratification. The reservoir
temperature is composed of a free function of the gravitational radius of the
system divided by the redshift. Upon specification of the reduced temperature
free function, the solutions for the gravitational radii compatible with the
data are found. The black hole inside has two possible horizon radii. It is
shown that there is a first law of thermodynamics for the system, another for
the hot shell, and yet another for the black hole. A thermodynamic stability
analysis is performed. By specifying for the free function the Hawking
temperature for the gravitational radius of the system, which is not a black
hole, one finds a remarkable exact thermodynamic solution. With it one
establishes that pure black holes, hot shells with a black hole, pure hot
shells, and hot flat spaces are phases that cohabit in the ensemble, with some
acting as thermodynamic mimickers. This exact solution is a model to situations
involving black holes and hot gravitons. The high temperature limits reveal

interstellar shocks in diffuse and translucent ISM environments have been
especially lacking. We present the most sensitive survey to date of SiO --
often considered an unambiguous tracer of interstellar shocks -- in absorption,
obtained with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array interferometer. We detect
SiO in 5/8 directions probing diffuse and translucent environments without
ongoing star formation. Our results demonstrate that SiO formation in the
diffuse ISM (i.e., in the absence of significant star formation and stellar
feedback) is more widespread and effective than previously reported. The
observed SiO linewidths are all $\lesssim$ 4 km$~$s$^{-1}$, excluding
high-velocity shocks as a formation mechanism. Yet, the SiO abundances we
detect are mostly 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than typically assumed in
quiescent environments and are often accompanied with other molecular
transitions whose column densities cannot be explained with UV-dominated
chemical models. Our results challenge the traditional view of SiO production

dark acoustic oscillations (sDAO). In altDM scenarios, both the halo mass
functions and the UV luminosity functions at $z\gtrsim 6$ are suppressed at the
low-mass/faint end, leading to delayed global star formation and reionization
histories. However, strong non-linear effects enable altDM models to ""catch up""
with cold dark matter (CDM) in terms of star formation and reionization. The
specific star formation rates are enhanced in halos below the half-power mass
in altDM models. This enhancement coincides with increased gas abundance,
reduced gas depletion times, more compact galaxy sizes, and steeper metallicity
gradients at the outskirts of the galaxies. These changes in galaxy properties
can help disentangle altDM signatures from a range of astrophysical
uncertainties. Meanwhile, it is the first time that altDM models have been
studied in RHD simulations of galaxy formation. We uncover significant
systematic uncertainties in reionization assumptions on the faint-end
luminosity function. This underscores the necessity of accurately modeling the
small-scale morphology of reionization in making predictions for the low-mass
galaxy population. Upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging surveys
of deep, lensed fields hold potential for uncovering the faint, low-mass galaxy
population, which could provide constraints on altDM models.

Python), estimates the intensity and power spectra of [CII], [OIII], and CO
rotational transition lines up to the $J$-levels (1-0) to (13-12) based both on
analytic formalism and on simulations. We develop a relation among halo mass,
SFR, and multi-line intensities that permits us to construct a generic formula
for the evolution of several line strengths up to $z \sim 10$. We implement a
variety of star formation models and multi-line luminosity relations to
estimate the astrophysical uncertainties on the intensity power spectrum of
these lines. As a demonstration, we predict the signal-to-noise ratio of [CII]
detection for an EoR-Spec-like instrument on the Fred Young Submillimeter

(DM), and discuss two techniques to measure the effect and constrain the DM
parameter space. The Stodolsky effect is the spin-dependent shift in the energy
of a Standard Model (SM) fermion sitting in a bath of neutrinos. This effect,
which scales linearly in the effective coupling, manifests as a small torque on
the SM fermion spin and has historically been proposed as a method of detecting
the cosmic neutrino background. We generalise this effect to DM, and give
expressions for the induced energy shifts for DM candidates from spin-$0$ to
spin-$\frac 32$, considering all effective operators up to mass dimension-6. In
all cases, the effect scales inversely with the DM mass, but requires an
asymmetric background. We show that a torsion balance experiment is sensitive
to energy shifts of $\Delta E \gtrsim 10^{-28}\,\mathrm{eV}$, whilst a more
intricate setup using a SQUID magnetometer is sensitive to shifts of $\Delta E
\gtrsim 10^{-32}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Finally, we compute the energy shifts for a
model of scalar DM, and demonstrate that the Stodolsky effect can be used to
constrain regions of parameter space that are not presently excluded.

Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) boundary term of GR changes under the transition to
TEGR and STEGR within the framework of metric-affine gravity. We show that $B$
is the difference between the GHY term of GR and that of metric-affine gravity.
Moreover, we show that the GHY term for both TEGR and STEGR must vanish for

extend the equivalence between GR, TEGR and STEGR beyond the Einstein-Hilbert

Specifically, we study how exploration rates evolves by applying adaptive
dynamics to the replicator-mutator equation, under two types of fitness
functions. For the first, payoffs are accrued from playing a two-player,
two-action symmetric game, we consider representatives of all games in this
class and find exploration rates often evolve downwards, but can also undergo
neutral selection as well. Second, we study time dependent fitness with a
function having a single oscillating peak. By increasing the period, we see a
jump in the optimal exploration rate, which then decreases towards zero. These
results establish several possible evolutionary scenarios for exploration
rates, providing insight into many applications, including why we can see such
diversity in rates of cultural change.

arise from extensive unsupervised training data. Such biases can produce
suboptimal samples, skewed outcomes, and unfairness, with potentially
significant repercussions. Consequently, aligning these models with human
ethics and preferences is an essential step toward ensuring their responsible
and effective deployment in real-world applications. Prior research has
primarily employed Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) as a means
of addressing this problem, wherein generative models are fine-tuned using RL
algorithms guided by a human-feedback-informed reward model. However, the
inefficiencies and instabilities associated with RL algorithms frequently
present substantial obstacles to the successful alignment of generative models,
necessitating the development of a more robust and streamlined approach. To
this end, we introduce a new framework, Reward rAnked FineTuning (RAFT),
designed to align generative models more effectively. Utilizing a reward model
and a sufficient number of samples, our approach selects the high-quality
samples, discarding those that exhibit undesired behavior, and subsequently
assembles a streaming dataset. This dataset serves as the basis for aligning
the generative model and can be employed under both offline and online
settings. Notably, the sample generation process within RAFT is gradient-free,
rendering it compatible with black-box generators. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed algorithm exhibits strong
performance in the context of both large language models and diffusion models.

sequence stars with convective cores by constructing stellar model tracks.
Within our mass range of interest, the inner turning point of p modes as
determined by the JWKB approximation evolves in two distinct phases during the
main sequence, implying a sudden loss of near-core sensitivity during the
discontinuous transition between the two phases. However, we also employ
non-JWKB asymptotic analysis to derive a contrasting set of expressions for the
effects that these structural properties will have on the mode frequencies,
which do not encode any such transition. We show analytically that a
sufficiently near-core perturbation to the stellar structure results in
non-oscillatory, degree-dependent perturbations to the star's oscillation mode
frequencies, contrasting with the case of an outer glitch. We also demonstrate
numerically that these near-core acoustic glitches exhibit strong angular
degree dependence, even at low degree, agreeing with the non-JWKB analysis,
rather than the degree-independent oscillations which emerge from JWKB
analyses. These properties have important implications for using p-modes to
study near-core mixing processes for intermediate-mass stars on the main

extremely high shear and loads in addition to nanoconfinement effects. Here, we
use molecular dynamics simulations with a coarse grained model to study a
nanometric film of an ionic liquid confined between two planar solid surfaces
both at equilibrium and at several shear rates. The strength of the interaction
between the solid surface and the ions was changed by simulating three
different surfaces with enhanced interactions with different ions. The increase
of the interaction with either the cation or the anion leads to the formation
of a solid-like layer that moves alongside the substrates, but this layer can
exhibit different structures and stability. An increase in interaction with the
high symmetry anion produces a more regular structure that is more resistant to
the effects of shear and viscous heating. Two definitions were proposed and
used for the calculation of the viscosity: a local definition based on
microscopic characteristics of the liquid and an engineering definition based
on the forces measured at the solid surfaces, with the former displaying a
correlation with the layered structure induced by the surfaces. Because of the
shear thinning behavior of the ionic liquids as well as the temperature rise
brought on by viscous heating, both the engineering and the local viscosities
decrease as the shear rate increases.

swimming dynamics. Inspired by the experimentally observed prolate composite
droplets and elliptic camphor disks, we employ simulations to investigate the
phoretic dynamics of an elliptic disk that uniformly emits solutes in the
creeping flow regime. By varying the disk's eccentricity $e$ and the P'eclet
number $\Pe$, we distinguish five disk behaviors: stationary, steady, orbiting,
periodic, and chaotic. We perform a global linear stability analysis (LSA) to
predict the onset of instability and the most unstable eigenmode when a
stationary disk spontaneously transitions to steady self-propulsion. In
addition to the LSA, we use an alternative approach to determine the
perturbation growth rate, offering valuable insights into the competing roles
of advection and diffusion. The steady motion features a transition from a
puller-type to a neutral-type swimmer as $\Pe$ increases, which occurs as a
bimodal concentration profile at the disk surface shifts to a polarized solute
distribution, driven by convective solute transport. An elliptic disk achieves
an orbiting motion through a chiral symmetry-breaking instability, wherein it
repeatedly follows a circular path while simultaneously rotating. The swinging
periodic motion, emerging from a steady motion via a supercritical Hopf
bifurcation, is characterized by a wave-like trajectory. We uncover a
transition from normal diffusion to superdiffusion as eccentricity $e$
increases, corresponding to a random-walking circular disk and a ballistically
swimming elliptic counterpart, respectively.

rehabilitation of hearing loss, but its performance is still limited in
difficult everyday conditions characterized by noise and reverberation.
  Objectives. Introduction to the current state of hearing aid technology and
presentation of the current state of research and future development.
  Methods. Current literature is analyzed and several specific new developments
are presented.
  Results. Both objective and subjective data from empirical studies show the
limitation of current technology. Examples of current research show the
potential of machine-learning based algorithms and multi-modal signal
processing for improving speech processing and perception, of using virtual
reality for improving hearing device fitting and of mobile health technology
for improving hearing-health services.
  Conclusions. Hearing device technology will remain a key factor in the
rehabilitation of hearing impairment. New technology such as machine learning,
and multi-modal signal processing, virtual reality and mobile health technology
will improve speech enhancement, individual fitting and communication training.

splitting the data. However, splitting in this manner may fail to capture the
geometric properties of the data. Thus, oblique decision trees generate the
oblique hyperplane for splitting the data at each non-leaf node. Oblique
decision trees capture the geometric properties of the data and hence, show
better generalization. The performance of the oblique decision trees depends on
the way oblique hyperplanes are generate and the data used for the generation
of those hyperplanes. Recently, multiple classifiers have been used in a
heterogeneous random forest (RaF) classifier, however, it fails to generate the
trees of proper depth. Moreover, double RaF studies highlighted that larger
trees can be generated via bootstrapping the data at each non-leaf node and
splitting the original data instead of the bootstrapped data recently. The
study of heterogeneous RaF lacks the generation of larger trees while as the
double RaF based model fails to take over the geometric characteristics of the
data. To address these shortcomings, we propose heterogeneous oblique double
RaF. The proposed model employs several linear classifiers at each non-leaf
node on the bootstrapped data and splits the original data based on the optimal
linear classifier. The optimal hyperplane corresponds to the models based on
the optimized impurity criterion. The experimental analysis indicates that the
performance of the introduced heterogeneous double random forest is
comparatively better than the baseline models. To demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed heterogeneous double random forest, we used it for the
diagnosis of Schizophrenia disease. The proposed model predicted the disease
more accurately compared to the baseline models.

this work, we propose new subgrid models that are consistent with the physics

turbulence using Germano (1986) decomposition. We show that Leonard and Cross
stresses are responsible for the enstrophy dissipation, while the Reynolds
stress is responsible for additional kinetic energy backscatter. We utilize
these findings to propose a new model, consisting of three parts, that is
compared to a baseline dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM). The three-component
model accurately simulates the spectral transfer of energy and enstrophy and
improves the representation of kinetic energy (KE) spectrum, resolved KE and
enstrophy decay in a posteriori experiments. The backscattering component of
the new model (Reynolds stress) is implemented both in quasi-geostrophic and

``hole'' with the context; (ii) Fill Anything: after certain objects removal,
users could provide text-based prompts to IA, and then it will fill the hole
with the corresponding generative content via driving AIGC models like Stable

the click-selected object and replace the remaining background with the newly

asked it to compose a scientific review article on each subdiscipline,

factors such as the number of citations, publication date, and the journal in
which the work was published. Our findings indicate that GPT tends to cite
highly-cited publications in environmental science, with a median citation
count of 1184.5. It also exhibits a preference for older publications, with a
median publication year of 2010, and predominantly refers to well-respected

Interestingly, our findings suggest that GPT seems to exclusively rely on

inference, TDT models can skip input frames guided by the predicted duration
output, which makes them significantly faster than conventional Transducers

accuracy and significantly faster inference than conventional Transducers on
different sequence transduction tasks. TDT models for Speech Recognition
achieve better accuracy and up to 2.82X faster inference than conventional

Despite their successes in language and vision tasks, we have yet seen an
attempt to develop foundation models for geospatial artificial intelligence
(GeoAI). In this work, we explore the promises and challenges of developing
multimodal foundation models for GeoAI. We first investigate the potential of
many existing FMs by testing their performances on seven tasks across multiple
geospatial subdomains including Geospatial Semantics, Health Geography, Urban
Geography, and Remote Sensing. Our results indicate that on several geospatial
tasks that only involve text modality such as toponym recognition, location
description recognition, and US state-level/county-level dementia time series
forecasting, these task-agnostic LLMs can outperform task-specific
fully-supervised models in a zero-shot or few-shot learning setting. However,
on other geospatial tasks, especially tasks that involve multiple data
modalities (e.g., POI-based urban function classification, street view
image-based urban noise intensity classification, and remote sensing image
scene classification), existing foundation models still underperform
task-specific models. Based on these observations, we propose that one of the
major challenges of developing a FM for GeoAI is to address the multimodality
nature of geospatial tasks. After discussing the distinct challenges of each
geospatial data modality, we suggest the possibility of a multimodal foundation
model which can reason over various types of geospatial data through geospatial
alignments. We conclude this paper by discussing the unique risks and

methods to examine the molecular deformations and fracture mechanisms of

greatly facilitate energy dissipation during plastic deformation, particularly
if the coordination numbers decrease. The appearance of fracture can then be
accurately located based on the spatial distribution of the atoms. We further
observe that the static unstrained structure encodes the propensity for local
atomic coordination to change during applied strain, hence a distinct
connection can be made between the initial atomic configurations before loading
and the final far-from-equilibrium atomic configurations upon fracture. These
results are essential for understanding how atomic arrangements strongly

relativity that one may wish to test with gravitational wave observations.
Einstein-aether theory is a model that introduces Lorentz-symmetry breaking in
the gravitational sector through an aether vector field, while still leading to
second-order field equations. This well-posed theory passes particle physics
constraints because it modifies directly only the gravitational sector, yet it
predicts deviations in the inspiral and coalescence of compact objects. We
here, for the first time, put this theory to the test by comparing its
gravitational wave predictions directly against LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave
data. We construct a waveform model for Einstein-aether theory,
EA_IMRPhenomD_NRT, through modifications of the general relativity
IMRPhenomD_NRTidalv2 model (used by the LIGO/VIRGO collaboration). This model
constructs a reponse function that not only contains the transverse-traceless
polarization, but also additional Einstein-aether (scalar and vectorial)
polarizations simultaneously. We then use the many current constraints on the
theory to construct non-trivial priors for the Einstein-aether coupling
constants. After testing the waveform model, we conduct parameter estimation
studies on two gravitational wave events: GW170817 and GW190425. We find that
these data are not sufficiently informative to place constraints on the theory
that are stronger than current bounds from binary pulsar, solar system and
cosmological observations. This is because, although Einstein-aether
modifications include additional polarizations and have been computed beyond
leading post-Newtonian order, these modifications are dominated by
(already-constrained) dipole effects. These difficulties make it unclear
whether future gravitational wave observations will be able to improve on
current constraints on Einstein-aether theory.

successful in predicting thermal conductivity at room and medium temperatures
but may misrepresent behavior at high temperatures. In this work, we predict
the thermal conductivity ($\kappa$) of ZrC including electronic and phonon
contributions from 300 K to 3500 K, by including high-order phonon scattering,
lattice expansion, temperature-dependent (TD) harmonic and anharmonic force
constants, and inter-band phonon conduction by using first principles. For the
phonon transport, we find that four-phonon scattering significantly reduces the
phonon thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{ph}$), e.g., by $\sim$60% and $\sim$75%
at 2500 K and 3500 K, respectively. After including four-phonon scattering and
all other factors, $\kappa_{ph}$ shows a $\sim$T$^{-1.5}$ rather than
$\sim$T$^{-1}$ dependence. The contribution from inter-band (Wigner) phonon
conduction is small, even at ultra-high temperatures. The temperature
dependence of anharmonic force constants decreases the phonon scattering
cross-section at elevated temperatures and increases the $\kappa_{ph}$
significantly (by 52% at 3500 K). For the electronic thermal transport, we find
that it is sensitive to and can be changed by 20% by the TD lattice constants.
The Lorenz number varies from 1.6 to 3.3$\times$10$^{-8}$
W$\cdot\Omega\cdot$K$^{-2}$ at different temperatures. The theoretical
prediction in the literature overpredicts $\kappa_{ph}$ (e.g., $\sim$28%) and
underpredicts the $\kappa_{el}$ (e.g., $\sim$38%), resulting in an overall
underprediction of $\kappa$ ($\sim$26% at 1500 K). The impacts of grain size
and defects are found strong, and no reported experimental data has reached the
intrinsic theoretical thermal conductivity of ZrC yet.

three parts: determining the timing of the beats (action placement),
determining where in space the runes connected with the chosen beats should be
placed (action selection) and web-application creation. For the first task of
action placement, extraction of predominant local pulse (PLP) information from
music recordings is used. This approach allows to learn where and how many
beats are supposed to be placed. For the second task of action selection,
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are used, specifically Gated recurrent unit

those rules and receive completely new levels. Then the last task was to build
a solution for non-technical players, the task was to combine the results of
the first and the second parts into a web application for easy use. For this

that this framework unifies the detection of OOD examples caused by semantic

""programmed"" via prompt engineering. We are still learning how to best
""program"" these LLMs to help developers. We start with the intuition that
developers tend to consciously and unconsciously have a collection of semantics
facts in mind when working on coding tasks. Mostly these are shallow, simple
facts arising from a quick read. For a function, examples of facts might
include parameter and local variable names, return expressions, simple pre- and
post-conditions, and basic control and data flow, etc.
  One might assume that the powerful multi-layer architecture of
transformer-style LLMs makes them inherently capable of doing this simple level
of ""code analysis"" and extracting such information, implicitly, while
processing code: but are they, really? If they aren't, could explicitly adding
this information help? Our goal here is to investigate this question, using the
code summarization task and evaluate whether automatically augmenting an LLM's
prompt with semantic facts explicitly, actually helps.
  Prior work shows that LLM performance on code summarization benefits from
few-shot samples drawn either from the same-project or from examples found via
information retrieval methods (such as BM25). While summarization performance
has steadily increased since the early days, there is still room for
improvement: LLM performance on code summarization still lags its performance
on natural-language tasks like translation and text summarization.
  We find that adding semantic facts actually does help! This approach improves
performance in several different settings suggested by prior work, including
for two different Large Language Models. In most cases, improvement nears or
exceeds 2 BLEU; for the PHP language in the challenging CodeSearchNet dataset,
this augmentation actually yields performance surpassing 30 BLEU.

different from the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formed without

cool faster. We present nonequilibrium hasty shortcuts -- externally controlled
temporal protocols that rapidly steer a system from an initial steady state to
a desired final steady state. The term ``hasty'' indicates that the shortcut
only involves fast dynamics without relying on slow relaxations. We provide a

revealed the inferred plane-of-the-sky magnetic field (B-field) orientation in
the Galactic center's Circum-Nuclear Disk (CND). The B-field is mostly aligned
with the steamers of ionized material falling onto Sgr A* at large,
differential velocities (shear). In such conditions, estimating the B-field
strength with the ``classical"" Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method does not
provide accurate results. We derive a ``modified'' DCF method by solving the
ideal MHD equations from first principles considering the effects of a
large-scale, shear flow on the propagation of a fast magnetosonic wave. In the
context of the DCF approximation, both the value of the shear and its Laplacian
affect the inferred B-field strength. Using synthetic polarization data from
MHD simulations for a medium dominated by shear flows, we find that the
``classical'' DCF determines B-field strengths only within $>50$\% of the true
value where the ``modified"" DCF results are improved significantly
($\sim$3-22\%). Applying our ``modified'' DCF method to the CND revealed
B-field strengths of $\sim1 - 16$ mG in the northern arm, $\sim1 - 13$ mG in
the eastern arm, and $\sim3 - 27$ mG in the western arm at spatial scales
$\lesssim1$ pc. The balance between turbulent gas energy (kinetic +
hydrostatic) and turbulent magnetic energy densities suggest that, along the
magnetic-field-flow direction, magnetic effects become less dominant as the
shear flow increases and weakens the B-field via magnetic convection. Our
results indicate that the transition from magnetically to gravitationally
dominated accretion of material onto Sgr A* starts at distances $\sim$ 1 pc.

future behavior of scholars. In particular, it allows us to infer the
likelihood that scientists choose future research directions via the
intertwined mechanisms of selection and social influence. Here we thoroughly
investigate the interplay between collaboration and topic switches. We find
that the probability for a scholar to start working on a new topic increases
with the number of previous collaborators, with a pattern showing that the
effects of individual collaborators are not independent. The higher the
productivity and the impact of authors, the more likely their coworkers will
start working on new topics. The average number of coauthors per paper is also
inversely related to the topic switch probability, suggesting a dilution of
this effect as the number of collaborators increases.

use exogenous variation in advertising exposure (RCTs) for a subset of ad
campaigns to build a model that can predict the causal effect of ad campaigns

Experimentation (PIE) -- frames the task of estimating the causal effect of an
ad campaign as a prediction problem, with the unit of observation being an RCT
itself. In contrast, traditional causal inference approaches with observational
data seek to adjust covariate imbalance at the user level. A key insight is to
use post-campaign features, such as last-click conversion counts, that do not
require an RCT, as features in our predictive model. We find that our PIE model
recovers RCT-derived incremental conversions per dollar (ICPD) much better than
the program evaluation approaches analyzed in Gordon et al. (forthcoming). The
prediction errors from the best PIE model are 48%, 42%, and 62% of the
RCT-based average ICPD for upper-, mid-, and lower-funnel conversion outcomes,
respectively. In contrast, across the same data, the average prediction error
of stratified propensity score matching exceeds 491%, and that of
double/debiased machine learning exceeds 2,904%. Using a decision-making
framework inspired by industry, we show that PIE leads to different decisions
compared to RCTs for only 6% of upper-funnel, 7% of mid-funnel, and 13% of
lower-funnel outcomes. We conclude that PIE could enable advertising platforms
to scale causal ad measurement by extrapolating from a limited number of RCTs

modes, the characteristic frequencies associated with perturbed black hole
spacetimes, central to the stability of these black holes, are themselves
stable. Though the differential operator governing the perturbation of black
hole spacetimes is self-adjoint, the boundary conditions are dissipative in
nature, so that the spectral theorem becomes inapplicable, and there is no
guarantee regarding the stability of the quasi-normal modes. We have provided a
general method of transforming to the hyperboloidal coordinate system, for both
asymptotically flat and asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes, which neatly
captures the dissipative boundary conditions, and the differential operator
becomes non-self-adjoint. Employing the pseudospectrum analysis and numerically
implementing the same through Chebyshev's spectral method, we present how the
quasi-normal modes will drift away from their unperturbed values under external
perturbation of the scattering potential. Intriguingly, for strong enough
perturbation, even the fundamental quasi-normal mode drifts away from its
unperturbed position for asymptotically de Sitter black holes, in stark
contrast to the case of asymptotically flat black holes. This feature holds
irrespective of the nature of the perturbing field and is also independent of
black hole hairs. Besides presenting several other interesting results,
specifically for asymptotically de Sitter black holes, we also discuss the
implications of the instability of the fundamental quasi-normal mode on the
strong cosmic censorship conjecture.

to their effectiveness in analyzing and predicting the evolution of complex
interconnected graph-based systems. However, hardware deployment of DGNNs still
remains a challenge. First, DGNNs do not fully utilize hardware resources
because temporal data dependencies cause low hardware parallelism.
Additionally, there is currently a lack of generic DGNN hardware accelerator
frameworks, and existing GNN accelerator frameworks have limited ability to
handle dynamic graphs with changing topologies and node features. To address
the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we propose DGNN-Booster, which is
a novel Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) accelerator framework for
real-time DGNN inference using High-Level Synthesis (HLS). It includes two
different FPGA accelerator designs with different dataflows that can support
the most widely used DGNNs. We showcase the effectiveness of our designs by
implementing and evaluating two representative DGNN models on ZCU102 board and
measuring the end-to-end performance. The experiment results demonstrate that
DGNN-Booster can achieve a speedup of up to 5.6x compared to the CPU baseline
(6226R), 8.4x compared to the GPU baseline (A6000) and 2.1x compared to the
FPGA baseline without applying optimizations proposed in this paper. Moreover,
DGNN-Booster can achieve over 100x and over 1000x runtime energy efficiency
than the CPU and GPU baseline respectively. Our implementation code and
on-board measurements are publicly available at

shown to outperform simple ``estimate then optimize"" when the model is

of the asymptotic optimality gap, i,e, the mean, all other moments, and the

inequality safety constraints and ensure inter-agent collision avoidance. The
continuum deformation optimization is formulated as a quadratic programming
problem. It consists of the following components: (i) decision variables that
represent the weights in the first hidden layer; (ii) a quadratic cost function
that penalizes deviation of the nominal MAS trajectory from the desired MAS

less attention to agents' dynamic participation, particularly regarding
incentive compatibility with respect to these decisions. This addresses this
gap by studying a dynamic mechanism design problem of task delegation. We
expand upon the classic state mechanism model by incorporating agents' dual
decisions concerning participation (off-menu actions) and regular action
selections across multiple periods. The principal faces adverse selection, as
agents receive private information over time that remains unobserved by the
principal, and designs a mechanism of a task policy profile, which outlines the
evolution of available action menus for agents; a coupling policy profile that
directly impacts agents' utilities; and an off-switch function profile that
assigns compensation or penalties if an agent withdraws. First, we present a
sufficient condition called ``payoff-flow conservation"" for ensuring dynamic
incentive compatibility concerning regular actions. Second, we propose a unique
process called persistence transformation, which allows us to derive a
closed-form formulation for each off-switch function based on the task policy
and carrier functions. This enables us to obtain a sufficient condition for the
incentive-compatible concerning agents' combined decisions of off-menu and
regular actions, aligning with the principal's preferences. Third, we provide a
necessary condition for incentive compatibility that goes beyond canonical
envelope conditions by leveraging the coupled optimality of the
principal-desired off-menu and regular actions. This method allows us to obtain
a set of sufficient conditions for incentive compatibility by pinning down an
explicit expression for each carrier function, thereby determining the precise
closed-form formulations of both the coupling functions and the off-switch
functions.

  Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Robots operating in real-world environments must reason about possible
outcomes of stochastic actions and make decisions based on partial observations
of the true world state. A major challenge for making accurate and robust
action predictions is the problem of confounding, which if left untreated can
lead to prediction errors. The partially observable Markov decision process
(POMDP) is a widely-used framework to model these stochastic and
partially-observable decision-making problems. However, due to a lack of
explicit causal semantics, POMDP planning methods are prone to confounding bias
and thus in the presence of unobserved confounders may produce underperforming
policies. This paper presents a novel causally-informed extension of ""anytime
regularized determinized sparse partially observable tree"" (AR-DESPOT), a
modern anytime online POMDP planner, using causal modelling and inference to
eliminate errors caused by unmeasured confounder variables. We further propose
a method to learn offline the partial parameterisation of the causal model for
planning, from ground truth model data. We evaluate our methods on a toy
problem with an unobserved confounder and show that the learned causal model is
highly accurate, while our planning method is more robust to confounding and
produces overall higher performing policies than AR-DESPOT.

used to characterize the metallic vs insulator nature of large (finite)

formalism. This introduces border effects, which prevents a fast convergence to
the thermodynamic limit and which can be eliminated within the formalism of
periodic boundary conditions. Recently, we have introduced an original approach
to periodic boundary conditions, named Clifford Boundary Conditions. It
considers a finite fragment extracted from a periodic system and the
modification of its topology into that of a Clifford Torus. The quantity
representing the position is modified in order to fulfill the system
periodicity. In this work, we apply the formalism of Clifford Boundary
Conditions to the case of Carbon Nanotubes, whose treatment results to be
particularly simple for the Zigzag geometry. Indeed, we demonstrate that at the
H\""uckel level these nanotubes, either finite or periodic, are formally
equivalent to a collection of {\em non-interacting dimerized linear chains},
thus simplifying their treatment. This equivalence is used to describe some
nanotube properties as the sum of the contributions of the independent chains
and to identify the origin of peculiar behaviors (such as the conductivity).
Indeed, if the number of hexagons along the circumference is a multiple of
three a metallic behavior is found, namely a divergence of both the (per
electron) polarizability and total position spread of at least one linear
chain. These results are in agreement with those in the literature from
Tight-Binding calculations.

reveal the horizontal and vertical structure of a planet's thermal emission and
the dynamics of hot Jupiters. Someday, they even may reveal the surface maps of
rocky planets. However, inverting lightcurves into maps requires an
understanding of the planet, star and instrumental trends because they can
resemble the gradual flux variations as the planet rotates (ie. partial phase
curves). In this work, we simulate lightcurves with baseline trends and assess
the impact on planet maps. Baseline trends can be erroneously modeled by
incorrect astrophysical planet map features, but there are clues to avoid this
pitfall in both the residuals of the lightcurve during eclipse and sharp
features at the terminator of the planet. Models that use a Gaussian process or
polynomial to account for a baseline trend successfully recover the input map
even in the presence of systematics but with worse precision for the m=1
spherical harmonic terms. This is also confirmed with the ThERESA eigencurve
method where fewer lightcurve terms can model the planet without correlations
between the components. These conclusions help aid the decision on how to
schedule observations to improve map precision. If the m=1 components are
critical, such as measuring the East/West hotspot shift on a hot Jupiter,
better characterization of baseline trends can improve the m=1 terms'
precision. For latitudinal North/South information from the remaining mapping
terms, it is preferable to obtain high signal-to-noise at ingress/egress with

presence of topologically protected zero-energy bound states localized at the
corners of a flake. In this paper we theoretically study the occurrence and
features of such corner states inside flakes in the shape of a convex polygon.
We consider two different models, the first obeying inversion symmetry and the
other obeying a combined $\pi/4$ rotation symmetry and time-reversal symmetry
($\hat{C}_4^z\hat{T}$). By Using an analytical effective model of an edge
corresponding to a massive Dirac fermion, we determine the presence of a corner
state between two given edges by studying the sign of their induced masses and
derive general rules for flakes in the shape of a convex polygon. In
particular, we find that the number of corner states in a flake is always two
in the first model, while in the second model there are either 0, 2 or 4. To
corroborate our findings, we focus on flakes of specific shapes (a triangle and
a square) and use a numerical finite-difference approach to determine the
features of the corner states in terms of their probability density. In the
case of a triangular flake, we can change the position of corner states by
rotating the flake in the first model, while in the second model we can also
change their number. Remarkably, when the induced mass of an edge is zero the
corresponding corner state becomes delocalized along the edge. In the case of a
square flake and the model with $\hat{C}_4^z\hat{T}$ symmetry, there is an
orientation of the flake with respect to the crystal axes, for which the corner
states extend along the whole perimeter of the square.

behavior, leading to potential dangers for human coworkers. This paper presents
a novel control framework by adopting safety-critical control and uncertainty
estimation for human-robot collaboration. Additionally, to select the shortest
path during collaboration, a novel quadratic penalty method is presented. The
innovation of the proposed approach is that the proposed controller will
prevent the robot from violating any safety constraints even in cases where
humans move accidentally in a collaboration task. This is implemented by the
combination of a time-varying integral barrier Lyapunov function (TVIBLF) and
an adaptive exponential control barrier function (AECBF) to achieve a flexible
mode switch between path tracking and collision avoidance with guaranteed
closed-loop system stability. The performance of our approach is demonstrated
in simulation studies on a 7-DOF robot manipulator. Additionally, a comparison
between the tasks involving static and dynamic targets is provided.

achieved via a novel cross-spectral registration network (CSR) which computes
an optical flow between images of different spectral bands. The CSR network is
also trained with self-supervision using an Anchor-Consistency loss, which we
also introduce in this work. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed

Standard convergence results for finding a performatively stable classifier
with the method of repeated risk minimization assume that the data distribution
is Lipschitz continuous to the model's parameters. Under this assumption, the
loss must be strongly convex and smooth in these parameters; otherwise, the
method will diverge for some problems. In this work, we instead assume that the
data distribution is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the model's
predictions, a more natural assumption for performative systems. As a result,
we are able to significantly relax the assumptions on the loss function. In
particular, we do not need to assume convexity with respect to the model's
parameters. As an illustration, we introduce a resampling procedure that models
realistic distribution shifts and show that it satisfies our assumptions. We
support our theory by showing that one can learn performatively stable
classifiers with neural networks making predictions about real data that shift

dramatically affect the metal-sealed structure. Wireless communication is
desirable to communicate with internal sensors, but it experiences high
attenuation losses since metal can block wireless signals due to its high
conductivity. This paper develops a low-cost through-metal communication system
prototype using off-the-shelf electronic components. The system is fully
reconfigurable, and arbitrary modulation and coding schemes can be implemented.
We design the transmit module which includes a signal processing
microcontroller, an amplifier, and a transmit coil, and the receive module
which includes a receive coil, an amplifier, and a microcontroller with
demodulation algorithms and bit-error-rate (BER) calculations. The performance
of the prototype is evaluated using various symbol rates, distances, and
transmission power. The results show that the communication system can achieve
a 500 bps data rate with 0.01 BER and 3.4 cm communication range when
penetrating an Aluminum pipe with 7 mm thickness.

doses of 1013, 1014, and 1015 ions/cm2 were used while keeping the ion energy
at 700keV. The irradiation induced structural and optical changes in GaN films
were measured using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The XRD
measurements on irradiated films discovered several extra peaks in the XRD
spectrum compared with the as-grown GaN film indicating the formation of new
phases or defects in the GaN film due to the ion irradiation. The intensity of
these extra peaks increases with increasing ion dose, suggesting that the
density of defects in the GaN film also increases with increasing ion dosage.
The UV-Vis measurements revealed a decrease in the bandgap of the irradiated
GaN films from 3.40 eV for the pristine GaN film to 3.26 eV for the film
irradiated with highest dose of 1015 ions/cm2. The decrease in bandgap can be
attributed to the creation of defects and/or the formation of new phases in the

the number of communities based on the subsampled network instead of the entire
dataset. This leads to important computational advantages over existing
methods. We theoretically investigate the computational complexity and
identification consistency of the SM-BIC. Furthermore, the advantages of the
SM-BIC are demonstrated by extensive numerical studies.

growing concern about the fairness of such methods. Prior literature on

presented approaches to manage some of them. However, most studies have focused
on fairness issues that arise from actions taken by a (single) focal

scenario, there are multiple lenders who evaluate loans for applicants, along
with policymakers and other institutions whose decisions also affect outcomes.
Thus, the broader impact of any lending decision of a single decision maker

the parameter importance score and the unimportant parameters are masked during
the generation of adversarial examples. This process is simple, yet can be

crucial to the deployment of UAVs, especially rotary-wing UAVs whose propulsion
power is sensitive to the wind effect. In this paper, we first derive a
three-dimensional (3D) generalised propulsion energy consumption model (GPECM)
for rotary-wing UAVs under the consideration of stochastic wind modeling and 3D
force analysis. Based on the GPECM, we study a UAV-enabled downlink
communication system, where a rotary-wing UAV flies subject to stochastic wind
disturbance and provides communication services for ground users (GUs). We aim
to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the UAV by jointly optimizing the 3D
trajectory and user scheduling among the GUs based on the GPECM. We formulate
the problem as stochastic optimization, which is difficult to solve due to the
lack of real-time wind information. To address this issue, we propose an
offline-based online adaptive (OBOA) design with two phases, namely, an offline
phase and an online phase. In the offline phase, we average the wind effect on
the UAV by leveraging stochastic programming (SP) based on wind statistics;
then, in the online phase, we further optimize the instantaneous velocity to
adapt the real-time wind. Simulation results show that the optimized
trajectories of the UAV in both two phases can better adapt to the wind in
changing speed and direction, and achieves a higher EE compared with the
windless scheme. In particular, our proposed OBOA design can be applied in the
scenario with dramatic wind changes, and makes the UAV adjust its velocity
dynamically to achieve a better performance in terms of EE.

nature of the emotion expression. We propose a hierarchical cross-attention
model (HCAM) approach to multi-modal emotion recognition using a combination of
recurrent and co-attention neural network models. The input to the model
consists of two modalities, i) audio data, processed through a learnable
wav2vec approach and, ii) text data represented using a bidirectional encoder
representations from transformers (BERT) model. The audio and text
representations are processed using a set of bi-directional recurrent neural
network layers with self-attention that converts each utterance in a given
conversation to a fixed dimensional embedding. In order to incorporate
contextual knowledge and the information across the two modalities, the audio
and text embeddings are combined using a co-attention layer that attempts to
weigh the utterance level embeddings relevant to the task of emotion
recognition. The neural network parameters in the audio layers, text layers as
well as the multi-modal co-attention layers, are hierarchically trained for the
emotion classification task. We perform experiments on three established
datasets namely, IEMOCAP, MELD and CMU-MOSI, where we illustrate that the
proposed model improves significantly over other benchmarks and helps achieve
state-of-art results on all these datasets.

reasoning support abductive reasoning tasks. Abductive reasoning is a form of
logical inference in which a hypothesis is formulated from a set of
observations, and that hypothesis is used to explain the observations. The
ability to formulate such hypotheses is important for lawyers and legal
scholars as it helps them articulate logical arguments, interpret laws, and
develop legal theories. Our motivation is to consider the belief that deep
learning models, especially large language models (LLMs), will soon replace
lawyers because they perform well on tasks related to legal text processing.
But to do so, we believe, requires some form of abductive hypothesis formation.
In other words, while LLMs become more popular and powerful, we want to
investigate their capacity for abductive reasoning. To pursue this goal, we
start by building a logic-augmented dataset for abductive reasoning with
498,697 samples and then use it to evaluate the performance of a SOTA model in
the legal field. Our experimental results show although these models can
perform well on tasks related to some aspects of legal text processing, they
still fall short in supporting abductive reasoning tasks.

equations (PDEs) in the spirit of the random feature method. The numerical
solution is constructed using a space-time partition of unity and random
feature functions. Two different ways of constructing the random feature
functions are investigated: feature functions that treat the spatial and
temporal variables (STC) on the same footing, or functions that are the product
of two random feature functions depending on spatial and temporal variables
separately (SoV). Boundary and initial conditions are enforced by penalty
terms. We also study two ways of solving the resulting least-squares problem:
the problem is solved as a whole or solved using the block time-marching
strategy. The former is termed ``the space-time random feature method''
(ST-RFM). Numerical results for a series of problems show that the proposed
method, i.e. ST-RFM with STC and ST-RFM with SoV, have spectral accuracy in
both space and time. In addition, ST-RFM only requires collocation points, not
a mesh. This is important for solving problems with complex geometry. We
demonstrate this by using ST-RFM to solve a two-dimensional wave equation over
a complex domain. The two strategies differ significantly in terms of the
behavior in time. In the case when block time-marching is used, we prove a
lower error bound that shows an exponentially growing factor with respect to
the number of blocks in time. For ST-RFM, we prove an upper bound with a
sublinearly growing factor with respect to the number of subdomains in time.
These estimates are also confirmed by numerical results.

has recently been extensively studied by exploiting Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs). Most DNNs-based methods require a large amount of training data with
ground truth, requiring tedious and time-consuming work. Few-shot HDR imaging
aims to generate satisfactory images with limited data. However, it is
difficult for modern DNNs to avoid overfitting when trained on only a few
images. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised approach to realize
few-shot HDR imaging via two stages of training, called SSHDR. Unlikely
previous methods, directly recovering content and removing ghosts
simultaneously, which is hard to achieve optimum, we first generate content of
saturated regions with a self-supervised mechanism and then address ghosts via
an iterative semi-supervised learning framework. Concretely, considering that
saturated regions can be regarded as masking Low Dynamic Range (LDR) input
regions, we design a Saturated Mask AutoEncoder (SMAE) to learn a robust
feature representation and reconstruct a non-saturated HDR image. We also
propose an adaptive pseudo-label selection strategy to pick high-quality HDR
pseudo-labels in the second stage to avoid the effect of mislabeled samples.
Experiments demonstrate that SSHDR outperforms state-of-the-art methods
quantitatively and qualitatively within and across different datasets,
achieving appealing HDR visualization with few labeled samples.

of assets to achieve a balance of profit and risk based on historical returns.
As a quantum algorithm, QAOA has the potential to outperform classical
algorithms in solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, its
application to portfolio optimization is restricted due to the high number of
qubits required in its encoding (Hodson encoding or Domain-wall encoding) to
represent a narrow range of shares.
  To overcome this limitation, we use quasi-binary encoding to represent
integer shares and construct a mixing operator for this purpose. The number of
qubits used to represent each asset does not exceed $2\log_2(D+1)$ when the sum
constraint of the combinatorial optimization problem is $D$. Our optimization
model is more complex, with range constraints added to the sum constraint. We
have also developed an iterative method to improve the accuracy without
increasing the number of qubits through multiple experiments. Numerical
experiments show that by simulating 18-qubit systems seven times, we can
improve the precision to above 0.01, and the approximation ratio can reach

equivalent to the topologically nontrivial point gap of complex eigenvalues
under periodic boundary conditions, and vice versa. However, we find that this
concomitance can be broken, i.e., the skin modes can be present or absent
whereas the point gap is topologically trivial or nontrivial, respectively,
named anomalous non-Hermitian skin effect. This anomalous phenomenon arises
when the unidirectional hopping amplitudes leading to the decoupling-like

the open-world problem of automatically clustering a partially labelled
dataset, in which the unlabelled data contain instances from novel categories

without a known category number in the unlabelled data. We propose a framework,
named CiPR, to bootstrap the representation by exploiting Cross-instance
Positive Relations for contrastive learning in the partially labelled data
which are neglected in existing methods. First, to obtain reliable
cross-instance relations to facilitate the representation learning, we
introduce a semi-supervised hierarchical clustering algorithm, named selective
neighbor clustering (SNC), which can produce a clustering hierarchy directly
from the connected components in the graph constructed by selective neighbors.
We also extend SNC to be capable of label assignment for the unlabelled
instances with the given class number. Moreover, we present a method to
estimate the unknown class number using SNC with a joint reference score
considering clustering indexes of both labelled and unlabelled data. Finally,
we thoroughly evaluate our framework on public generic image recognition
datasets and challenging fine-grained datasets, all establishing the new
state-of-the-art.

resolution of event cameras to provide accurate inter/intra-frame dynamic
information. Specifically, an Event-based Inter/intra-frame Compensator (E-IC)
is proposed to predict the per-pixel dynamic between arbitrary time intervals,
including the temporal transition and spatial translation. Exploring
connections in terms of RS-RS, RS-GS, and GS-RS, we explicitly formulate mutual
constraints with the proposed E-IC, resulting in supervisions without
ground-truth GS images. Extensive evaluations over synthetic and real datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art and shows
remarkable performance for event-based RS2GS inversion in real-world scenarios.

ensures that P3, the probability of no-stockout at the end of the period of

fits to the emerging random variables. We use the lost-sales optimality

policy for discrete demand suggests that the fixed P3-policy is
close-to-optimal. An extensive numerical experiment shows that the FP3-policy
outperforms other policies proposed in literature in 97% of all cases. Under
the FP3-policy, the volatility of the replenishment process is much lower than
the volatility of the demand process. This cv-reduction holds a promise for
substantial cost reduction at upstream stages in the supply chain of the

forest fires and competing populations, are nonlinear, spatially extended
systems capable of spiking. Most investigations of excitable media consider
situations where the amplifying and suppressing forces necessary for spiking
coexist at every point in space. In this case, spiking requires a fine-tuned
ratio between local amplification and suppression strengths. But, in Nature and
engineered systems, these forces can be segregated in space, forming structures
like interfaces and boundaries. Here, we show how boundaries can generate and
protect spiking if the reacting components can spread out: even arbitrarily
weak diffusion can cause spiking at the edge between two non-excitable media.
This edge spiking is a robust phenomenon that can occur even if the ratio
between amplification and suppression does not allow spiking when the two sides
are homogeneously mixed. We analytically derive a spiking phase diagram that
depends on two parameters: (i) the ratio between the system size and the
characteristic diffusive length-scale, and (ii) the ratio between the
amplification and suppression strengths. Our analysis explains recent
experimental observations of action potentials at the interface between two
non-excitable bioelectric tissues. Beyond electrophysiology, we highlight how
edge spiking emerges in predator-prey dynamics and in oscillating chemical
reactions. Our findings provide a theoretical blueprint for a class of
interfacial excitations in reaction-diffusion systems, with potential
implications for spatially controlled chemical reactions, nonlinear waveguides
and neuromorphic computation, as well as spiking instabilities, such as cardiac
arrhythmias, that naturally occur in heterogeneous biological media.

on stale models and to contribute to aggregation when ready. However, we show
empirically that this method can lead to a substantial drop in training
accuracy as well as a slower convergence rate. The primary reason is that
fast-speed devices contribute to many more rounds of aggregation while others
join more intermittently or not at all, and with stale model updates. To
overcome this barrier, we propose TimelyFL, a heterogeneity-aware asynchronous
FL framework with adaptive partial training. During the training, TimelyFL
adjusts the local training workload based on the real-time resource
capabilities of each client, aiming to allow more available clients to join in
the global update without staleness. We demonstrate the performance benefits of
TimelyFL by conducting extensive experiments on various datasets (e.g.,
CIFAR-10, Google Speech, and Reddit) and models (e.g., ResNet20, VGG11, and
ALBERT). In comparison with the state-of-the-art (i.e., FedBuff), our
evaluations reveal that TimelyFL improves participation rate by 21.13%,
harvests 1.28x - 2.89x more efficiency on convergence rate, and provides a
6.25% increment on test accuracy.

extend the tail regression model to non-tail observations with an auxiliary

apply an artificial censoring mechanism of the likelihood contributions in the

illustrate the superiority of our approach for inference over classical

trajectory of 'Oumuamua, the first confirmed interstellar object discovered in
the solar system. 'Oumuamua passed through the inner solar system on a
hyperbolic (i.e., unbound) trajectory. Its discovery occurred after perihelion
passage, and near the time of its closest approach to Earth. After being
observable for approximately four months, the object became too faint and was
lost at a heliocentric distance of around 3 au. Intriguingly, analysis of the
trajectory of 'Oumuamua revealed that a dynamical model including only
gravitational accelerations does not provide a satisfactory fit of the data,
and a non-gravitational term must be included. The detected non-gravitational
acceleration is compatible with either solar radiation pressure or recoil due
to outgassing. It has, however, proved challenging to reconcile either
interpretation with the existing quantitative models of such effects without
postulating unusual physical properties for 'Oumuamua (such as extremely low
density and/or unusual geometry, non-standard chemistry). My analysis
independently confirms the detection of the non-gravitational acceleration.
After comparing several possible parametrizations for this effects, I find a
strong preference for a radially directed non-gravitational acceleration,
pointing away from the Sun, and a moderate preference for a power-law scaling
with the heliocentric distance, with an exponent between 1 and 2. These results
provide valuable constraints on the physical mechanism behind the effect; a
conclusive identification, however, is probably not possible on the basis of
dynamical arguments alone.

The shape of the X-ray continuum and the strong fluorescent iron line observed

  essential limitations for clinical translation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The limited ability of Convolutional Neural Networks to generalize to images
from previously unseen domains is a major limitation, in particular, for
safety-critical clinical tasks such as dermoscopic skin cancer classification.
In order to translate CNN-based applications into the clinic, it is essential
that they are able to adapt to domain shifts. Such new conditions can arise
through the use of different image acquisition systems or varying lighting
conditions. In dermoscopy, shifts can also occur as a change in patient age or
occurence of rare lesion localizations (e.g. palms). These are not prominently
represented in most training datasets and can therefore lead to a decrease in
performance. In order to verify the generalizability of classification models
in real world clinical settings it is crucial to have access to data which
mimics such domain shifts. To our knowledge no dermoscopic image dataset exists
where such domain shifts are properly described and quantified. We therefore
grouped publicly available images from ISIC archive based on their metadata
(e.g. acquisition location, lesion localization, patient age) to generate
meaningful domains. To verify that these domains are in fact distinct, we used
multiple quantification measures to estimate the presence and intensity of
domain shifts. Additionally, we analyzed the performance on these domains with
and without an unsupervised domain adaptation technique. We observed that in
most of our grouped domains, domain shifts in fact exist. Based on our results,
we believe these datasets to be helpful for testing the generalization
capabilities of dermoscopic skin cancer classifiers.

for human avatar reconstruction due to its high-quality rendering capabilities,
e.g., regarding novel views and poses. However, previous methods for editing
the geometry and appearance of the avatar only allow for global editing through
body shape parameters and 2D texture maps. In this paper, we propose a new
approach named \textbf{U}nified \textbf{V}olumetric \textbf{A}vatar
(\textbf{UVA}) that enables local and independent editing of both geometry and
texture, while retaining the ability to render novel views and poses. UVA
transforms each observation point to a canonical space using a skinning motion
field and represents geometry and texture in separate neural fields. Each field
is composed of a set of structured latent codes that are attached to anchor
nodes on a deformable mesh in canonical space and diffused into the entire
space via interpolation, allowing for local editing. To address spatial
ambiguity in code interpolation, we use a local signed height indicator. We
also replace the view-dependent radiance color with a pose-dependent shading
factor to better represent surface illumination in different poses. Experiments
on multiple human avatars demonstrate that our UVA achieves competitive results
in novel view synthesis and novel pose rendering while enabling local and

applications for a classification model. Vision Transformers (ViT) recently
achieve remarkable performance in Class Incremental Learning (CIL). Previous
works mainly focus on block design and model expansion for ViTs. However, in
this paper, we find that when the ViT is incrementally trained, the attention
layers gradually lose concentration on local features. We call this interesting
phenomenon as \emph{Locality Degradation} in ViTs for CIL. Since the low-level
local information is crucial to the transferability of the representation, it
is beneficial to preserve the locality in attention layers. In this paper, we
encourage the model to preserve more local information as the training
procedure goes on and devise a Locality-Preserved Attention (LPA) layer to
emphasize the importance of local features. Specifically, we incorporate the
local information directly into the vanilla attention and control the initial
gradients of the vanilla attention by weighting it with a small initial value.
Extensive experiments show that the representations facilitated by LPA capture
more low-level general information which is easier to transfer to follow-up
tasks. The improved model gets consistently better performance on CIFAR100 and

proposes a novel multi-fidelity learning method based on the Fourier Neural
Operator by jointing abundant low-fidelity data and limited high-fidelity data
under transfer learning paradigm. First, as a resolution-invariant operator,
the Fourier Neural Operator is first and gainfully applied to integrate
multi-fidelity data directly, which can utilize the scarce high-fidelity data
and abundant low-fidelity data simultaneously. Then, the transfer learning
framework is developed for the current task by extracting the rich low-fidelity
data knowledge to assist high-fidelity modeling training, to further improve
data-driven prediction accuracy. Finally, three typical fluid and temperature

introducing rotational disorder drives the through-plane LTC to the glass

to the collapse of their transverse acoustic modes in the through-plane

the through-plane LTC that operates for all chemistries considered here. The
minimal through-plane LTC is obtained for angles between 1 and 4 degree

  Systems",,,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Compared with the energy efficiency of conventional mobile communication
systems, the energy efficiency of fifth generation (5G) communication systems
has been improved more than 30 times. However, the energy consumption of 5G
communication systems is 3 times of the energy consumption of fourth generation
(4G) communication systems when the wireless traffic is increased more than 100
times in the last decade. It is anticipated that the traffic of future sixth
generation (6G) communication systems will keep an exponential growth in the
next decade. It is a key issue how much space is left for improving of energy
efficiency in mobile communication systems. To answer the question, an
entropy-based energy dissipation model based on nonequilibrium thermodynamics
is first proposed for mobile communication systems. Moreover, the theoretical
minimal energy dissipation limits are derived for typical modulations in mobile
communication systems. Simulation results show that the practical energy
dissipation of information processing and information transmission is three and
seven orders of magnitude away from the theoretical minimal energy dissipation
limits in mobile communication systems, respectively. These results provide
some guidelines for energy efficiency optimization in future mobile
communication systems.

media, which ranges from $0.1$ to $50$ relative to the fluid. The simulation is
carried out in a square RB cell with the Rayleigh number $Ra$ ranging from
$10^7$ to $10^9$ and the Prandtl number $Pr$ fixed at $4.3$. The porosity of
the system is fixed at $\phi=0.812$, with the porous media modeled by a set of
randomly displayed circular obstacles. For a fixed $Ra$, the increase of
conductivity shows a small effect on the total heat transfer, slightly
depressing the Nusselt number. The limited influence comes from the small
number of obstacles contacting with thermal plumes in the system as well as the
counteraction of the increased plume area and the depressed plume strength. The
study shows that the global heat transfer is insensitive to the conduction
effect of separated porous media in the bulk region, which may have

LightRW, a novel FPGA-based accelerator for GDRWs. LightRW embraces a series of
optimizations to enable fine-grained pipeline execution on the chip and to
exploit the massive parallelism of FPGA while significantly reducing memory

  analysis with small failure probability",,,,,"cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This study introduces a novel adaptive surrogate model methodology for the
reliability analysis of systems exhibiting small failure probabilities. To
circumvent the limitations inherent in conventional adaptive Kriging surrogate
model methodologies reliant on candidate sample pools, an adaptive Kriging
surrogate model methodology incorporating the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
algorithm is proposed. During implementation, the surrogate model is
iteratively refined and high-value samples are selected to update the surrogate
model through an optimization solution facilitated by PSO. Meanwhile, two
modified learning functions that account for local neighborhood effects and
distribution distance of samples for experimental design are introduced to
achieve an optimal balance between solution accuracy and efficiency for the
proposed methodology. The computational performance of the proposed methodology
is assessed using numerical examples. The results indicate that the integration
of PSO not only enhances the probability of obtaining high-value samples but
also markedly improves the solution accuracy of the adaptive Kriging surrogate
model methodology for reliability analysis. By leveraging an optimization
algorithm to determine high-value samples, the proposed methodology transcends
the limitations of conventional candidate pool-based selection methods,
exhibiting exceptional performance in addressing small failure probabilities.

  A class of graphs $\mathcal{F}$ is homomorphism-distinguishing closed if, for

photophobia, especially those who are easily irritated by light intensity. The
system uses a spatial light modulator (SLM) to selectively filter light
entering the eye based on the scene detection of a camera. By controlling the
transmittance of each pixel on the SLM using a modulation function, the
proposed sunglasses enable an automated non-linear field of view dimming and
also flexible light modulation that meets the photophobic user's visual
requirements. Meanwhile, an occlusion mask created on the SLM, which possesses
low transmittance to block the incoming light rays, appears blurred from the
eye since the focal plane is not on the SLM and blocks the light stimulation
insufficiently. To solve this problem, the aperture-based expanded mask has
been used in past studies, however, the excessive large expansion ratio used in
this approach leads to over-blocking (occlusion leak). In this work, we build
an optimization model by simulating the defocused occlusion mask and
determining the effective contribution of the degraded pixels based on the
occlusion efficiency of the pixel transmittance. While the non-processed mask
cannot provide sufficient occlusion and the aperture-based expanded mask causes
occlusion leak, our optimized mask attenuates the intensely bright areas to a
proper brightness without incorrectly attenuating surrounding areas that no

graph-structural data has gained noticeable success in recent years.
Nonetheless, most of the existing GCN-based models suffer from the notorious
over-smoothing issue, owing to which shallow networks are extensively adopted.
This may be problematic for complex graph datasets because a deeper GCN should
be beneficial to propagating information across remote neighbors. Recent works
have devoted effort to addressing over-smoothing problems, including
establishing residual connection structure or fusing predictions from
multi-layer models. Because of the indistinguishable embeddings from deep
layers, it is reasonable to generate more reliable predictions before
conducting the combination of outputs from various layers. In light of this, we
propose an Alternating Graph-regularized Neural Network (AGNN) composed of
Graph Convolutional Layer (GCL) and Graph Embedding Layer (GEL). GEL is derived
from the graph-regularized optimization containing Laplacian embedding term,
which can alleviate the over-smoothing problem by periodic projection from the
low-order feature space onto the high-order space. With more distinguishable
features of distinct layers, an improved Adaboost strategy is utilized to
aggregate outputs from each layer, which explores integrated embeddings of
multi-hop neighbors. The proposed model is evaluated via a large number of
experiments including performance comparison with some multi-layer or
multi-order graph neural networks, which reveals the superior performance
improvement of AGNN compared with state-of-the-art models.

experimental measurements of thousands of compounds to construct a proper
training set. While in some domains it is easier to acquire experimental data,
in others it might be more limited. For example, it is easier to test the
compounds on bacteria than perform in-vivo experiments. Thus, a key question is
how to utilize information from a large available dataset together with a small
subset of compounds where both domains are measured to predict compounds'

learning approaches for drug discovery, including training of pre-trained

frames should be treated as quantum physical systems. In this work, we combine
these insights with the emphasis on operationality, understood as refraining
from introducing into the framework objects not directly related to in
principle verifiable probabilities of measurement outcomes, and identifying the
setups indistinguishable as such. Based on intuitions from special relativity
and gauge theory, we introduce an operational notion of a quantum reference
frame -- which is defined as a quantum system equipped with a covariant
positive operator-valued measure (POVM) -- and build a framework on the concept
of operational equivalence that allows us to enforce operationality by
quotienting the quantum state spaces with equivalence relation of
indistinguishability by the available effects, assumed to be invariant under
gauge transformations, and framed in the sense of respecting the choice of the
frame's POVM. Such effects are accessed via the yen construction, which maps
effects on the system to those on the composite system, satisfying gauge
invariance and framing. They are called relative, and the classes of states
indistinguishable by them are referred to as relative states. We show that when
the frame is localizable, meaning that it allows for states that give rise to a
highly localized probability distribution of the frame's observable, by
restricting the relative description upon such localized frame preparation we
recover the usual, non-relational formalism of quantum mechanics. We provide a
consistent way of translating between different relative descriptions by means
of frame-change maps and compare these with the corresponding notions in other
approaches to QRF, establishing an operational agreement in the domain of

galaxy and the [C II] halo, and study the detectability of such signal in an
ALMA LIM survey. We model the central galaxy and the [C II] halo brightness
with a S\'ersic+exponential profile. The model has two free parameters: the
effective radius ratio $f_{R_e}$, and the central surface brightness ratio,
$f_{\Sigma}$, between the two components. [C II] halos can significantly boost
the LIM power spectrum signal. For example, for relatively compact [C II] halos
($f_\Sigma=0.4$, $f_{R_{\rm e}}=2.0$), the signal is boosted by $\simeq 20$
times; for more extended and diffuse halos ($f_\Sigma=0.1, f_{R_{\rm e}}=6.0$),
the signal is boosted by $\simeq 100$ times. For the ALMA ASPECS survey
(resolution $\theta_{\rm beam} = 1.13''$, survey area $\Omega_{\rm

the deL14d [C II] - SFR relation holds. However, with an optimized survey
($\theta_{\rm beam} = 0.232''$, $\Omega_{\rm survey}=2.0\,\rm deg^{2}$), the
power spectrum is detectable for almost all the [C II] - SFR relations

twins offer a cheaper alternative to them and can provide real-time
predictions. However, such digital twins can only provide short-term forecasts
accurately since they become unstable when time-integrated beyond 20 days.
Currently, the cause of the instabilities is unknown, and the methods that are
used to improve their stability horizons are ad-hoc and lack rigorous theory.
In this paper, we reveal that the universal causal mechanism for these
instabilities in any turbulent flow is due to \textit{spectral bias} wherein,
\textit{any} deep learning architecture is biased to learn only the large-scale
dynamics and ignores the small scales completely. We further elucidate how
turbulence physics and the absence of convergence in deep learning-based
time-integrators amplify this bias leading to unstable error propagation.
Finally, using the quasigeostrophic flow and ECMWF Reanalysis data as test
cases, we bridge the gap between deep learning theory and fundamental numerical
analysis to propose one mitigative solution to such instabilities. We develop
long-term stable data-driven digital twins for the climate system and
demonstrate accurate short-term forecasts, and hundreds of years of long-term
stable time-integration with accurate mean and variability.

notations and corresponding fairness testing approaches have been developed for
traditional deep classification models, they are essentially hardly applicable
to DRSs. One major difficulty is that there still lacks a systematic
understanding and mapping between the existing fairness notations and the
diverse testing requirements for deep recommender systems, not to mention
further testing or debugging activities. To address the gap, we propose
FairRec, a unified framework that supports fairness testing of DRSs from
multiple customized perspectives, e.g., model utility, item diversity, item
popularity, etc. We also propose a novel, efficient search-based testing
approach to tackle the new challenge, i.e., double-ended discrete particle

issues in the form of certain disadvantaged groups from a vast number of
candidate groups. Given the testing report, by adopting a simple re-ranking
mitigation strategy on these identified disadvantaged groups, we show that the
fairness of DRSs can be significantly improved. We conducted extensive
experiments on multiple industry-level DRSs adopted by leading companies. The
results confirm that FairRec is effective and efficient in identifying the
deeply hidden fairness issues, e.g., achieving 95% testing accuracy with half

remarkable success. However, real-world tasks include low-lighting conditions
which arise performance bottlenecks for models trained on large-scale RGB image

Therefore, the usage of thermal imagery in real-world applications can be
useful. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) allows transferring information
from a source domain to a fully unlabeled target domain. Despite substantial
improvements in UDA, the performance gap between UDA and its supervised
learning counterpart remains significant. By picking a small number of target
samples to annotate and using them in training, active domain adaptation tries
to mitigate this gap with minimum annotation expense. We propose an active
domain adaptation method in order to examine the efficiency of combining the
visible spectrum and thermal imagery modalities. When the domain gap is
considerably large as in the visible-to-thermal task, we may conclude that the
methods without explicit domain alignment cannot achieve their full potential.
To this end, we propose a spectral transfer guided active domain adaptation
method to select the most informative unlabeled target samples while aligning
source and target domains. We used the large-scale visible spectrum dataset
MS-COCO as the source domain and the thermal dataset FLIR ADAS as the target

coherent structures in turbulent channel flows is investigated by computing the
linear response to stochastic forcing. The responses to momentum and thermal
forcing are considered separately. Consistently with results of previous direct
numerical simulations, the influence of the mean flow stratification on
stochastic forcing amplifications is found to be non-negligible only for
streamwise-elongated large-scale structures. Unstable stratification is found
to enhance the peak variance of the response, except for the velocity response
to thermal forcing, and to increase the spanwise wavelength of the most
amplified structures. Stable stratification induces opposite effects. The
spanwise wavelengths maximizing the different types of variance amplifications,
all converge to approximately 6h when approaching the linear instability
threshold where large-scale coherent rolls become linearly unstable. In the
presence of even moderately unstable stratification, the profiles of turbulent
buoyancy and momentum fluxes and of rms vertical velocity of all types of most
amplified stochastic responses are nearly indistinguishable from those of the
critical mode becoming unstable at the critical Richardson number. The two most
energetic POD modes always contribute to more than 90% of the variance of the

the same mechanism underlies the onset of the instability of coherent
large-scale rolls at the critical Richardson number and the amplification of
coherent large-scale structures at subcritical Richardson numbers.

  Constraints on Sample Sizes in Strata",,,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.AP stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The optimal sample allocation in stratified sampling is one of the basic
issues of modern survey sampling methodology. It is a procedure of dividing the
total sample among pairwise disjoint subsets of a finite population, called
strata, such that for chosen survey sampling designs in strata, it produces the
smallest variance for estimating a population total (or mean) of a given study
variable. In this paper we are concerned with the optimal allocation of a
sample, under lower and upper bounds imposed jointly on the sample
strata-sizes. We will consider a family of sampling designs that give rise to
variances of estimators of a natural generic form. In particular, this family
includes simple random sampling without replacement (abbreviated as SI) in
strata, which is perhaps, the most important example of stratified sampling
design. First, we identify the allocation problem as a convex optimization
problem. This methodology allows to establish a generic form of the optimal
solution, so called optimality conditions. Second, based on these optimality
conditions, we propose new and efficient recursive algorithm, named RNABOX,
which solves the allocation problem considered. This new algorithm can be
viewed as a generalization of the classical recursive Neyman allocation
algorithm, a popular tool for optimal sample allocation in stratified sampling
with SI design in all strata, when only upper bounds are imposed on sample
strata-sizes. We implement the RNABOX in R as a part of our package stratallo,
which is available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Finally, in
the context of the established optimality conditions, we briefly discuss two
existing methodologies dedicated to the allocation problem being studied: the
noptcond algorithm introduced in Gabler, Ganninger and M\""unnich (2012); and
fixed iteration procedures from M\""unnich, Sachs and Wagner (2012).

other side. So far the explanation of this difference has been mostly searched
for in the limitations of the non-muonic experiments as the extrapolation to
$Q^2 \rightarrow 0$ GeV$^2$ for electron scattering. Since the time scale of
the vacuum polarization $e^+e^--$pairs, causing the bulk contribution of the
Lamb shift in muonic hydrogen, is very much shorter than that of the photon
exchanges, causing the Coulomb interaction, it is argued that the muon on its
orbit around the proton has to be considered as quasi particle dressed by
$e^+e^--$pairs and may not be treated as a bare particle in an external Uehling
potential. The proper realization of this view makes the proton radius puzzle
disappear. The value for the rms charge radius of the proton determined from
the muonic Lamb shift, taking this distinction into account, is $r_p =

over 14.7M posts during their lifespan over the past decade. These data are
supplemented with a full scrape of the Telegram channel used to disseminate new

Part of the activity decamped to Telegram, while traffic shifted from the

campaign lost interest quickly, traffic was directed back to the main domain,
users quickly returned, and the forum was back online and became even more

existing methods model item transitions assuming uniform intervals. Thus, how
to effectively model and predict the underlying dynamics for user preference

principled graph ordinary differential equation framework named GDERec.
Technically, GDERec is characterized by an autoregressive graph ordinary
differential equation consisting of two components, which are parameterized by
two tailored graph neural networks (GNNs) respectively to capture user

GNNs are trained alternately in an autoregressive manner to track the evolution

three dimension (3D). Here we report the observation of divergent 3D VHS in a
topological magnet EuCd2As2 by magneto-infrared spectroscopy. The divergent 3D
VHS is generated by substantially tuning the energy dispersion and momentum
distribution of the Weyl bands. Applying the external magnetic field allows
effective control of exchange interaction between itinerant electrons and local
magnetic moments. As a result, the 3D Weyl bands are found to shift
continuously with the canting of magnetic moment, which leads to the gradual
increase of Fermi velocity. Above the critical field Bc ~ 0.6 T, the formation
of a divergent 3D VHS is evidenced by the abrupt spectral emergence of the
inter-band transitions. This type of VHS allows in situ tunability by external
magnetic fields with adjustable energy position, DOS and even its presence. The
experimental spectrum and the emergence of 3D VHS can be quantitatively
described by a two-band minimal model of Weyl semimetal with the exchange
interaction. The deduced model predicts three additional optical transitions

  Hugo","Lossy Compression of Large-Scale Radio Interferometric Data",,,,,"astro-ph.IM cs.AI cs.LG math.ST stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This work proposes to reduce visibility data volume using a
baseline-dependent lossy compression technique that preserves smearing at the
edges of the field-of-view. We exploit the relation of the rank of a matrix and
the fact that a low-rank approximation can describe the raw visibility data as
a sum of basic components where each basic component corresponds to a specific
Fourier component of the sky distribution. As such, the entire visibility data
is represented as a collection of data matrices from baselines, instead of a
single tensor. The proposed methods are formulated as follows: provided a large
dataset of the entire visibility data; the first algorithm, named $simple~SVD$
projects the data into a regular sampling space of rank$-r$ data matrices. In
this space, the data for all the baselines has the same rank, which makes the
compression factor equal across all baselines. The second algorithm, named
$BDSVD$ projects the data into an irregular sampling space of rank$-r_{pq}$
data matrices. The subscript $pq$ indicates that the rank of the data matrix
varies across baselines $pq$, which makes the compression factor
baseline-dependent. MeerKAT and the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry
Network are used as reference telescopes to evaluate and compare the
performance of the proposed methods against traditional methods, such as
traditional averaging and baseline-dependent averaging (BDA). For the same
spatial resolution threshold, both $simple~SVD$ and $BDSVD$ show effective
compression by two-orders of magnitude higher than traditional averaging and
BDA. At the same space-saving rate, there is no decrease in spatial resolution
and there is a reduction in the noise variance in the data which improves the
S/N to over $1.5$ dB at the edges of the field-of-view.

the scene label constitute an image descriptor that we use to calculate a
similarity score between the query and database images. We validate our
approach on real-world data that exhibit significant changes in camera
viewpoints and object placement between the database and query trajectories.
The experimental results demonstrate that our method is applicable to a wide
range of indoor scenarios without the need for training or fine-tuning.

considered as natural candidates to harbour intense magnetic fields, both due
to their large masses and their high energy budgets coming from irradiation as
a consequence of their vicinity to their host stars. In this work we perform
MHD simulations of a narrow day-side atmospheric column of ultra-hot Jupiters,
suitable for very high local temperatures (T > 3000 K). Since the conductivity
in this regime is very high, the dominant effect is winding due to the intense
zonal winds. By including a forcing that mimics the wind profiles obtained in
global circulation models, the shear layer induces a strong toroidal magnetic
field (locally reaching hundreds of gauss), supported by meridional currents.
Such fields and the sustaining currents don$'$t depend on the internally
generated field, but are all confined in the thin (less than a scale-height)
shear layer around 1 bar. Additionally, we add random perturbations that induce
turbulent motions, which lead to further (but much smaller) magnetic field
generation to a broader range of depths. These results allow an evaluation of
the currents induced by the atmospheric dynamo. Although here we use ideal MHD
and the only resistivity comes from the numerical scheme, we estimate
a-posteriori the amount of Ohmic heat deposited in the outer layers, which
could be employed in evolutionary models for Hot Jupiters' inflated radii.

to solve the strong CP problem. Transition edge sensor (TES) X-ray
microcalorimeters can detect such axions very efficiently if they are again
converted into photons by a 57Fe absorber. We have designed and produced a
dedicated TES array with 57Fe absorbers for the solar axion search. The iron
absorber is set next to the TES, keeping a certain distance to reduce the
iron-magnetization effect on the spectroscopic performance. A gold thermal
transfer strap connects them. A sample pixel irradiated from a 55Fe source
detected 698 pulses. In contrast to thermal simulations, we consider that the
pulses include either events produced in an iron absorber or gold strap at a
fraction dependent on the absorption rate of each material. Furthermore,
photons deposited on the iron absorber are detected through the strap as
intended. The identification of all events still needs to be completed.
However, we successfully operated the TES with the unique design under iron
magnetization for the first time.

the role of the compositionally-driven relaxor state in (100-x)BiFeO3-xSrTiO3

positions of the (111) and (11-1) reflections reveal an initial non-ergodic
regime followed by long-range ferroelectric ordering after extended poling
cycles. The increased degree of random multi-site occupation in BFO-42STO
compared to BFO-35STO is correlated with an increase of the critical electric
field needed to induce the non-ergodic-to-ferroelectric transition, and a
decrease in the degree of domain reorientation. Although both compositions show
an irreversible transition to a long-range ferroelectric state, our results
suggest that the weaker ferroelectric response in BFO-42STO is related to an
increase in ergodicity. This, in turn, serves to guide the development of
BFO-based systems into promising platform for further property engineering

objectives related to buildings. This inevitably leads to the generation of
significant pseudo-changes, due to factors such as seasonal changes in images
and the inclination of building fa\c{c}ades. To alleviate the above-mentioned
problems, we developed a contrastive learning approach by validating historical
building footprints against single up-to-date remotely sensed images. This
contrastive learning strategy allowed us to inject the semantics of buildings
into a pipeline for the detection of changes, which is achieved by increasing
the distinguishability of features of buildings from those of non-buildings. In
addition, to reduce the effects of inconsistencies between historical building
polygons and buildings in up-to-date images, we employed a deformable
convolutional neural network to learn offsets intuitively. In summary, we
formulated a multi-branch building extraction method that identifies newly
constructed and removed buildings, respectively. To validate our method, we
conducted comparative experiments using the public Wuhan University building

established. Our method achieved F1 scores of 93.99% and 70.74% on the above

realistic heterogenous delay requirements of the computational tasks. Due to
the binary task allocation variable, the formulated optimization problem is
nonconvex. Therefore, we solve the bandwidth allocation and task allocation
problem by decoupling the original optimization problem into bandwidth
allocation and task allocation subproblems. As the bandwidth allocation problem
is a convex optimization problem, we first determine the bandwidth allocation
for given task allocation strategy, followed by conceiving the traditional
convex optimization strategy to obtain the bandwidth allocation solution. Based
on the asymptotic property of received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio

heterogenous task delay requirements. At last, simulation results are provided

object detection (CDWSOD), aiming at adapting the detector from source to
target domain through weak supervision. We think DETR has strong potential for
CDWSOD due to an insight: the encoder and the decoder in DETR are both based on
the attention mechanism and are thus capable of aggregating semantics across
the entire image. The aggregation results, i.e., image-level predictions, can
naturally exploit the weak supervision for domain alignment. Such motivated, we
propose DETR with additional Global Aggregation (DETR-GA), a CDWSOD detector
that simultaneously makes ""instance-level + image-level"" predictions and
utilizes ""strong + weak"" supervisions. The key point of DETR-GA is very simple:
for the encoder / decoder, we respectively add multiple class queries / a
foreground query to aggregate the semantics into image-level predictions. Our
query-based aggregation has two advantages. First, in the encoder, the
weakly-supervised class queries are capable of roughly locating the
corresponding positions and excluding the distraction from non-relevant
regions. Second, through our design, the object queries and the foreground
query in the decoder share consensus on the class semantics, therefore making
the strong and weak supervision mutually benefit each other for domain
alignment. Extensive experiments on four popular cross-domain benchmarks show
that DETR-GA significantly improves CSWSOD and advances the states of the art
(e.g., 29.0% --> 79.4% mAP on PASCAL VOC --> Clipart_all dataset).

quality of candidate solutions for selection. However, evaluating populations
on large training sets can be computationally expensive. Down-sampling training
sets has long been used to decrease the computational cost of evaluation in a
wide range of application domains. Indeed, recent studies have shown that both
random and informed down-sampling can substantially improve problem-solving
success for GP systems that use the lexicase parent selection algorithm. We use
the PushGP framework to experimentally test whether these down-sampling
techniques can also improve problem-solving success in the context of two other
commonly used selection methods, fitness-proportionate and tournament
selection, across eight GP problems (four program synthesis and four symbolic
regression). We verified that down-sampling can benefit the problem-solving
success of both fitness-proportionate and tournament selection. However, the
number of problems wherein down-sampling improved problem-solving success
varied by selection scheme, suggesting that the impact of down-sampling depends
both on the problem and choice of selection scheme. Surprisingly, we found that
down-sampling was most consistently beneficial when combined with lexicase
selection as compared to tournament and fitness-proportionate selection.
Overall, our results suggest that down-sampling should be considered more often
when solving test-based GP problems.

text-based image editing that guides minimal modifications of an input image
towards the content described in a target prompt. DDS leverages the rich
generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models and can be used as a loss
term in an optimization problem to steer an image towards a desired direction
dictated by a text. DDS utilizes the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS)
mechanism for the purpose of image editing. We show that using only SDS often
produces non-detailed and blurry outputs due to noisy gradients. To address
this issue, DDS uses a prompt that matches the input image to identify and
remove undesired erroneous directions of SDS. Our key premise is that SDS
should be zero when calculated on pairs of matched prompts and images, meaning
that if the score is non-zero, its gradients can be attributed to the erroneous
component of SDS. Our analysis demonstrates the competence of DDS for text
based image-to-image translation. We further show that DDS can be used to train
an effective zero-shot image translation model. Experimental results indicate
that DDS outperforms existing methods in terms of stability and quality,
highlighting its potential for real-world applications in text-based image

address this question by looking at universal principles that govern the
morphology and behavior of living systems. Living systems display a small-world
network structure in which many smaller clusters are nested within fewer larger
ones, producing a fractal-like structure with a power-law cluster size
distribution. Their dynamics show similar qualities: the timeseries of inner
message passing and overt behavior contain high frequencies or 'states' that
are nested within lower frequencies or 'traits'. Here, we argue that the nested
modular (power-law) dynamics of living systems results from their nested
modular (power-law) network structure: organisms 'vertically encode' the deep
spatiotemporal structure of their environments, so that high frequencies
(states) are produced by many small clusters at the base of a nested-modular
hierarchy and lower frequencies (traits) are produced by fewer larger clusters
at its top. These include physical as well as behavioral traits. Nested-modular
structure causes higher frequencies to be embedded in lower frequencies,
producing power-law dynamics. Such dynamics satisfy the need for efficient
energy dissipation through networks of coupled oscillators, which also governs
the dynamics of non-living systems (e.g. earthquake dynamics, stock market
fluctuations). Thus, we provide a single explanation for power-law frequency
spectra in both living and non-living systems. If hierarchical structure indeed
produces hierarchical dynamics, the development (e.g. during maturation) and
collapse (e.g. during disease) of hierarchical structure should leave specific
traces in power-law frequency spectra that may serve as early warning signs to
system failure. The applications of this idea range from embryology and
personality psychology to sociology, evolutionary biology and clinical
medicine.

the perspective of the entire universe and of Bphr idea that the classical
language is the language of our experience and QT acquires a meaning only with
a reference to it. We distinguish a classical or macroscopic level, and a
quantum or microscopic one that is perceived only through the modifications
that it induces in the first. The macroscopic state of the universe is assumed
to be specified by a set of variables, a classical energy momentum tensor and
some conserved currents, which are supposed to have a well defined value across
the entire space-time. To the energy-momentum tensor a classical metric is
related by the Einstein equation. The quantum state and dynamics are expressed
by the usual QT formalism in terms of a density operator and the ordinary
quantum operators in Heisenberg picture. For the macroscopic variables a basic
distribution of probability is postulated in terms of a density and the
corresponding quantum operators, so in some way their evolution is driven by
the underlying QT. Such postulate essentially replaces the usual elfadjoint
operators correspondence. For the Universe we adopt a variance of the
{\Lambda}CDM model with Omega=1, one single inflaton with an Higgs type
potential, the initial time at t=minus infinite. The expectation values of all
fundamental fields are supposed to vanish for time going to minus infinite. In
the framework the scalar fluctuation in the Cosmic Microwave Background are
correctly explained giving appropriate calue to the parameters in the
potential. As in more conventional models the absence of the tensor
fluctuations remains not understood, if even a quantum metric is introduced.
This seems to suggest that Gravity is a pure classical phenomenon, what could
be consistently accommodated in our formalism by an appropriate even if
somewhat ad hoc assumption

most of the literature on computer-assisted detection of AD focuses on
classifying brain images into one of three major categories: healthy, MCI, and

progress from MCI to AD at a future examination time during a given study
period, and (2) stable: those who stay as MCI and never progress to AD. This
misses the opportunity to accurately identify the trajectory of progressive MCI
patients. In this paper, we revisit the brain image classification task for AD
identification and re-frame it as an ordinal classification task to predict how
close a patient is to the severe AD stage. To this end, we select progressive
MCI patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)

indicates the time to progression to AD. We train a siamese network model to
predict the time to onset of AD based on MRI brain images. We also propose a

  Combining conventional and conditional profiles, we show that the nucleation
of oil droplets is initiated near the TNTI, and penetrates into the turbulent
region as the jet travels downstream. Persistent nucleation not only sustains
the scalar dissipation but also leads to enhanced temporal fluctuations of the
concentrations till the downstream position. The p.d.f.s of the concentration
exhibit pronounced bimodal shapes near the TNTI and positively-skewed curves
toward the centerline, suggesting that the oil droplets nucleate across the
jet. We estimate the nucleation rate near the TNTI using a control volume
approach. We also model the concentration field of the nucleated oil using that
of the passive scalar and the ternary phase diagram of a water, ethanol, and
anise oil mixture.
  This study extends our previous work on the mean field, revealing more
details of the turbulent statistics induced by solvent exchange. The findings
shed new light on the interplay between mixing and nucleation in a quasi-2D

machine learning models that are already able to achieve high accuracy for a
variety of yield prediction scenarios. The data included for the prediction of
yields are intricate and the models are often difficult to understand. However,
understanding the models can be simplified by using natural groupings of the
input features. Grouping can be achieved, for example, by the time the features
are captured or by the sensor used to do so. The state-of-the-art for
interpreting machine learning models is currently defined by the game-theoretic
approach of Shapley values. To handle groups of features, the calculated
Shapley values are typically added together, ignoring the theoretical
limitations of this approach. We explain the concept of Shapley values directly
computed for predefined groups of features and introduce an algorithm to
compute them efficiently on tree structures. We provide a blueprint for
designing swarm plots that combine many local explanations for global
understanding. Extensive evaluation of two different yield prediction problems
shows the worth of our approach and demonstrates how we can enable a better
understanding of yield prediction models in the future, ultimately leading to
mutual enrichment of research and application.

the controlling information as an input (i.e.,: conditional representation) for
the noise approximator, or introduce a pre-trained classifier in the test-phase
to guide the Langevin dynamic towards the conditional goal. However, the former
line of methods only work when the controlling information can be formulated as

classifier to be differentiable. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
named RGDM (Reward-Guided Diffusion Model) that guides the training-phase of

framework bridges the objective of weighted log-likelihood and maximum entropy
RL, which enables calculating policy gradients via samples from a pay-off
distribution proportional to exponential scaled rewards, rather than from

and enables diffusion models to explore for highly rewarded samples in the

polarized behavior in multiple data collections to infer the user's preferred

in terms of signal length distribution and its impact on training efficiency.
It is demonstrated that, for specific distributions, applying specific TSL

randomly sampling the start index of the waveforms resulting in more unique
examples for training. A SepFormer model trained using a TSL limit of 4.42s and

the human body. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose is an imaging modality commonly used to
detect cancer due to its high sensitivity and clear visualisation of the
pattern of metabolic activity. Nonetheless, as cancer is highly heterogeneous,
it is challenging to train general-purpose discriminative cancer detection
models, with data availability and disease complexity often cited as a limiting
factor. Unsupervised anomaly detection models have been suggested as a putative
solution. These models learn a healthy representation of tissue and detect
cancer by predicting deviations from the healthy norm, which requires models
capable of accurately learning long-range interactions between organs and their
imaging patterns with high levels of expressivity. Such characteristics are
suitably satisfied by transformers, which have been shown to generate
state-of-the-art results in unsupervised anomaly detection by training on
normal data. This work expands upon such approaches by introducing multi-modal
conditioning of the transformer via cross-attention i.e. supplying anatomical
reference from paired CT. Using 294 whole-body PET/CT samples, we show that our
anomaly detection method is robust and capable of achieving accurate cancer
localization results even in cases where normal training data is unavailable.
In addition, we show the efficacy of this approach on out-of-sample data
showcasing the generalizability of this approach with limited training data.
Lastly, we propose to combine model uncertainty with a new kernel density
estimation approach, and show that it provides clinically and statistically
significant improvements when compared to the classic residual-based anomaly
maps. Overall, a superior performance is demonstrated against leading
state-of-the-art alternatives, drawing attention to the potential of these
approaches.

fountains, namely quasi-two-dimensional fountains. Fountains are formed when
the momentum of the jet fluid is in the opposite direction to its buoyancy
force. This work consists of two parts. First, we injected an ethanol/oil
mixture (ouzo mixture) downward into quiescent water, forming a quasi-2D
fountain with oil droplet nucleation (ouzo fountain). In the steady state,
nucleation is restricted to the fountain rim, and there is hardly any
nucleation in the fountain body, suggesting limited mixing with the bath in the
quasi-two-dimensional fountain. By injecting a dyed ethanol solution as a
reference case, we confirmed that the local water fraction within the fountain
is indeed insufficient to induce nucleation.
  Second, we have studied the effect of density difference between the jet
fluid and the ambient water systematically. We injected saline solutions upward
into quiescent water with various concentrations of sodium chloride (NaCl) at
various flow rates. The fountains show stronger mixing and thus lower
concentration in the initial negatively buoyant jet (NBJ) stage. In the steady
fountain stage, the confinement induces the shielding effect by the outer flow,
which reduces the degree of mixing and leads to higher concentrations. Also, we
show that the density difference is the critical parameter that determines the
fountain concentration. The decreasing concentration with the density
difference indicates that the larger (negative) buoyancy effect enhances the
stretching of the fluid parcels \citep{Villermaux2019}, leading to a higher
degree of mixing in the fountain. From the probability density functions of the
concentration, we demonstrate that the degree of mixing in the steady fountain
stage is largely determined in the developing stages for a quasi-2D fountain.

climate crisis. Cities play an important role to reach climate neutrality as
more than 70% of global CO2 emissions originate from urban areas.
Decarbonization of energy supply systems can be achieved through various means,
including the use of renewable energy sources, improving the efficiency of
technologies, the coupling of different energy sectors, and the use of
flexibility considering individual prosumer behaviour. This leads to an
increasingly decentralized energy system, which is challenging to operate in a
robust and cost-effective way. The evaluation of technologies and subsystems
can only be done from the perspective of the system in which it is embedded and
it is highly dependent on their networking and application scenarios.
Therefore, the design and operation of energy systems require adequate
computation and evaluation tools, which offer a holistic view of all
interconnected components. The currently available optimization tools have
limitations, such as limited scope of technologies and sectors, high
requirements on data, high computational cost, and difficulty in handling
multi-objective optimization. To overcome these limitations a software
framework called FOCUS for the flexible and dynamic modeling of any urban
sector-coupled energy system is developed. The framework includes a library
containing models for different technologies and offers a variety of parameter
sets for each technology. FOCUS can handle multi-objective problems by
returning Pareto-optimal fronts, which helps users to discover the trade-off
between criteria and objectives. The developed tool can identify new
flexibility potentials in the energy system, actively support companies in the
respective field to optimize urban energy system planning solutions, and
determine possible threads to the stable operation of such systems.

as a one-dimensional totally asymmetric exclusion process with extended
particles. Here we focus on the effects of premature termination of translation
through the irreversible detachment of ribosomes. We consider a model where the
detachment is induced by the unsuccessful attempt to move to an occupied site.
The model is exactly solvable in a simplified geometry consisting of the
translation initiation region followed by a single slow site representing a
translation bottleneck. In agreement with recent experimental and computational
studies we find a non-monotonic dependence of the ribosome current on the
initiation rate, but only if the leading particle in a colliding pair detaches.
Simulations show that the effect persists for larger lattices and extended
bottlenecks. In the homogeneous system the ribosome density decays
asymptotically as the inverse square root of the distance to the initiation
site.

the astrophysical community, despite the fact that systematics affect the
reported parallaxes at the level of ~ 10 muas. Independent distance
measurements are available from asteroseismology of red-giant stars with
measurable parallaxes, whose magnitude and colour ranges more closely reflect
those of other stars of interest. In this paper, we determine distances to
nearly 12,500 red-giant branch and red clump stars observed by Kepler, K2, and
TESS. This is done via a grid-based modelling method, where global
asteroseismic observables, constraints on the photospheric chemical
composition, and on the unreddened photometry are used as observational inputs.
This large catalogue of asteroseismic distances allows us to provide a first
comparison with Gaia EDR3 parallaxes. Offset values estimated with
asteroseismology show no clear trend with ecliptic latitude or magnitude, and
the trend whereby they increase (in absolute terms) as we move towards redder
colours is dominated by the brightest stars. The correction model proposed by
Lindegren et al. (2021) is not suitable for all the fields considered in this
study. We find a good agreement between asteroseismic results and model
predictions of the red clump magnitude. We discuss possible trends with the
Gaia scan law statistics, and show that two magnitude regimes exist where
either asteroseismology or Gaia provides the best precision in parallax.

  Using Temporal Dynamic Modeling","15 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  For visual estimation of optical flow, a crucial function for many vision
tasks, unsupervised learning, using the supervision of view synthesis has
emerged as a promising alternative to supervised methods, since ground-truth
flow is not readily available in many cases. However, unsupervised learning is
likely to be unstable when pixel tracking is lost due to occlusion and motion
blur, or the pixel matching is impaired due to variation in image content and
spatial structure over time. In natural environments, dynamic occlusion or
object variation is a relatively slow temporal process spanning several frames.
We, therefore, explore the optical flow estimation from multiple-frame
sequences of dynamic scenes, whereas most of the existing unsupervised
approaches are based on temporal static models. We handle the unsupervised
optical flow estimation with a temporal dynamic model by introducing a
spatial-temporal dual recurrent block based on the predictive coding structure,
which feeds the previous high-level motion prior to the current optical flow
estimator. Assuming temporal smoothness of optical flow, we use motion priors
of the adjacent frames to provide more reliable supervision of the occluded
regions. To grasp the essence of challenging scenes, we simulate various
scenarios across long sequences, including dynamic occlusion, content
variation, and spatial variation, and adopt self-supervised distillation to
make the model understand the object's motion patterns in a prolonged dynamic
environment. Experiments on KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, Sintel Clean, and Sintel
Final datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on unsupervised
optical flow estimation. The proposal achieves state-of-the-art performance

jointly optimize power control and LSFD weights for maximizing the sum SE and

improved intra-thalamic contrast and thalamic boundaries, and their

rare case that a system displays two precursors, successive overtones of either

function of the equation of state, the binary mass ratio, the mode quantum

models: a 'discrete quantum control' model where the experimentalist can
interleave time evolution under the unknown Hamiltonian with instantaneous
quantum operations, a 'continuous quantum control' model where the
experimentalist can augment the Hamiltonian with bounded control terms, and a
model where the experimentalist has no control over the system's time evolution
(but can choose initial states and final measurements). With continuous quantum
control, we provide an adaptive algorithm for learning a many-body Hamiltonian
at the Heisenberg limit, $T = \mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$, which requires only
preparation of product states, time-evolution, and measurement in a product
basis. In the absence of quantum control, we prove that learning is standard
quantum limited, $T = \Omega(\epsilon^{-2})$, for large classes of many-body
Hamiltonians, including any Hamiltonian that thermalizes via the eigenstate
thermalization hypothesis. Our no-go results apply even to learning algorithms

anisotropic due to the self-shielding of a geometrically thick accretion disk,
and then the radiative feedback on the surrounding medium would be suppressed
in the equatorial region, within which super-Eddington accretion can continue.
However, if this region is sufficiently heated via thermal conduction from the

surrounding gas becomes isotropically hot and the Bondi accretion rate would be
suppressed and become sub-Eddington. We evaluate the condition under which such

there is often a difference between one's internal identity (how salient
different aspects of one's identity are to oneself) and external identity (how
salient different aspects are to the external world). We attempt to capture the
internal and external saliences of different dimensions of identity for
influential users (""influencers"") on Twitter using the follow graph. We
consider an influencer's ""ego-centric"" profile, which is determined by their
personal following patterns and is largely in their direct control, and their
""audience-centric"" profile, which is determined by the following patterns of
their audience and is outside of their direct control. Using these following
patterns we calculate a corresponding salience metric that quantifies how
important a certain dimension of identity is to an individual. We find that
relative to their audiences, influencers exhibit more salience in race in their
ego-centric profiles and less in religion and politics. One practical
application of these findings is to identify ""bridging"" influencers that can
connect their sizeable audiences to people from traditionally underheard
communities. This could potentially increase the diversity of views audiences
are exposed to through a trusted conduit (i.e. an influencer they already

theoretical X-ray-burst models, compared with burst light curves with
GS~1826-24 observations. We focus on the impacts of the NS mass, the NS radius,
and base-heating on the NS surface using the MESA code. We find a monotonic
correlation between the NS mass and the parameters of the light curve. The
higher the mass, the longer the recurrence time and the greater the peak
luminosity. While the larger the radius, the longer the recurrence time, the
peak luminosity remains nearly constant. In the case of increasing base
heating, both the recurrence time and peak luminosity decrease. We also examine
the above results using with a different numerical code, HERES, based on
general relativity and consider the central NS. We find that the burst rate,
burst energy and burst strength are almost same in two X-ray burst codes by
adjusting the base-heat parameter in MESA (the relative errors $\lesssim5\%$),
while the duration time and the rise time are significantly different between
(the relative error is possibly $\sim50\%$). The peak luminosity and the
e-folding time are ragged between two codes for different accretion rates.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) perspective plays a vital role in building a
perception model for UAV. With the limitations of large-scale densely labeled
data, semantic scene segmentation for UAV views requires a broad understanding
of an object from both its top and side views. Adapting from well-annotated
autonomous driving data to unlabeled UAV data is challenging due to the
cross-view differences between the two data types. Our work proposes a novel
Cross-View Adaptation (CROVIA) approach to effectively adapt the knowledge
learned from on-road vehicle views to UAV views. First, a novel geometry-based
constraint to cross-view adaptation is introduced based on the geometry
correlation between views. Second, cross-view correlations from image space are
effectively transferred to segmentation space without any requirement of paired
on-road and UAV view data via a new Geometry-Constraint Cross-View (GeiCo)
loss. Third, the multi-modal bijective networks are introduced to enforce the
global structural modeling across views. Experimental results on new cross-view
adaptation benchmarks introduced in this work, i.e., SYNTHIA to UAVID and GTA5

mechanism for heating the early universe intergalactic medium (IGM). Following
a review of the existing literature on cosmic ray heating, we develop a
flexible model of this heating mechanism for use in semi-numerical 21-cm signal
simulations and conduct the first investigations of the signatures it imprints
on the 21-cm power spectrum and tomographic maps. We find that cosmic ray
heating of the IGM is short-ranged, leading to heating clustered around
star-forming sites, and a sharp contrast between heated regions of 21-cm
emission and unheated regions of absorption. This contrast results in greater
small-scale power for cosmic ray heated scenarios compared to what is found for
X-ray heating, thus suggesting a way to test the nature of IGM heating with
future 21-cm observations. Finally, we find an unexpectedly rich thermal
history in models where cosmic rays can only escape efficiently from low-mass
halos, such as in scenarios where these energetic particles originate from
population III star supernovae remnants. The interplay of heating and the
Lyman-Werner feedback in these models can produce a local peak in the IGM

with solvent exchange in quasi-2D jets. We inject an ethanol/oil mixture upward
into quiescent water, forming quasi-2D turbulent buoyant jets and triggering
the ouzo effect with initial Reynolds numbers, Re_0=420, 840, and 1680. We
study starting jets with continuous injection and puffs with finite volume
injection. While both modes start with the jet stage, the puff exhibits
different characteristics in transport, entrainment, mixing, and nucleation.
  For the starting jets, the total nucleated mass from the ouzo mixture seems
very similar to that of the passive scalar total mass, indicating a primary
nucleation site slightly above the virtual origin above the injection needle,
supplying the mass flux like the passive scalar injection. With continuous
mixing above the primary nucleation site, the mildly increasing nucleation rate
suggests the occurrence of secondary nucleation throughout the entire ouzo jet.
For the puffs, although the entrainment and nucleation reduce drastically when
the injection stops, the mild mixing still leads to non-zero nucleation rates
and the reduced decay of the mean puff concentrations for the ouzo mixture.
  Adapting the theoretical framework established in \citet{Landel2012b} for
quasi-2D turbulent jets and puffs, we successfully model the transport of the
horizontally-integrated concentrations for the passive scalar. The fitted
advection and dispersion coefficients are then used to model the transport of
the ouzo mixture, from which the spatial-temporal evolution of the nucleation
rate can be extracted. The spatial distribution of the nucleation rate sheds
new light on the solvent exchange process in transient turbulent jet flows.

Hypergraphs serve as powerful modeling tools for describing and analyzing the
intricate behaviors of systems with multi-body interactions. Herein, we
investigate a discrete-time nonlinear averaging dynamics with three-body
interactions: an underlying hypergraph, comprising triples as hyperedges,
delineates the structure of these interactions, while the vertices update their
states through a weighted, state-dependent average of neighboring pairs'
states. This dynamics captures reinforcing group effects, such as peer
pressure, and exhibits higher-order dynamical effects resulting from a complex
interplay between initial states, hypergraph topology, and nonlinearity of the
update. Differently from linear averaging dynamics on graphs with two-body
interactions, this model does not converge to the average of the initial states
but rather induces a shift. By assuming random initial states and by making
some regularity and density assumptions on the hypergraph, we prove that the
dynamics converges to a multiplicatively-shifted average of the initial states,
with high probability. We further characterize the shift as a function of two
parameters describing the initial state and interaction strength, as well as
the convergence time as a function of the hypergraph structure.

In this paper, we propose Eunomia, a symbolic execution technique that allows
users to specify local domain knowledge to enable fine-grained search. In
Eunomia, we design an expressive DSL, Aes, that lets users precisely pinpoint
local searching strategies to different parts of the target program. To further
optimize local searching strategies, we design an interval-based algorithm that
automatically isolates the context of variables for different local searching
strategies, avoiding conflicts between local searching strategies for the same
variable. We implement Eunomia as a symbolic execution platform targeting
WebAssembly, which enables us to analyze applications written in various
languages (like C and Go) but can be compiled into WebAssembly. To the best of
our knowledge, Eunomia is the first symbolic execution engine that supports the
full features of the WebAssembly runtime. We evaluate Eunomia with a dedicated
microbenchmark suite for symbolic execution and six real-world applications.
Our evaluation shows that Eunomia accelerates bug detection in real-world
applications by up to three orders of magnitude. According to the results of a
comprehensive user study, users can significantly improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of symbolic execution by writing a simple and intuitive Aes
script. Besides verifying six known real-world bugs, Eunomia also detected two

quantum mechanics, especially understanding the concept of angular momentum
operators. Suppose now that a transformation from laboratory-fixed to
molecule-attached coordinates, by invoking the correspondence principle,
induces reversed angular momentum operator identities. However, the foundations
of quantum mechanics and the mathematical implementation of specific symmetries
assert that reversal of motion or time reversal includes complex conjugation as
part of anti-unitary operation. Quantum theory contraindicates sign changes of
the fundamental angular momentum algebra. Reversed angular momentum sign
changes are of a heuristic nature and are actually not needed in analysis of
diatomic spectra. This review addresses sustenance of usual angular momentum
theory, including presentation of straightforward proofs leading to
falsification of the occurrence of reversed angular momentum identities. This

existing methods are mainly built upon uniform Euclidean space, which has been
found to be conflict with the power-law distributions of real-world graphs and
unable to represent the hierarchical connections between nodes effectively.
With respect to the special data characteristic, hyperbolic geometry offers an
ideal alternative due to its exponential expansion property. In this paper, we
propose HGWaveNet, a novel hyperbolic graph neural network that fully exploits
the fitness between hyperbolic spaces and data distributions for temporal link
prediction. Specifically, we design two key modules to learn the spatial
topological structures and temporal evolutionary information separately. On the
one hand, a hyperbolic diffusion graph convolution (HDGC) module effectively
aggregates information from a wider range of neighbors. On the other hand, the
internal order of causal correlation between historical states is captured by
hyperbolic dilated causal convolution (HDCC) modules. The whole model is built
upon the hyperbolic spaces to preserve the hierarchical structural information
in the entire data flow. To prove the superiority of HGWaveNet, extensive
experiments are conducted on six real-world graph datasets and the results show
a relative improvement by up to 6.67% on AUC for temporal link prediction over
SOTA methods.

modern explainability methods could help to unravel the differences between SSL

comparing the robustness of supervised and SSL models to corruptions in input

exceed the performance of either alone. The combination of their capabilities
is often realized by learning to defer algorithms that enable the AI to learn
to decide whether to make a prediction for a particular instance or defer it to
the human expert. However, to accurately learn which instances should be
deferred to the human expert, a large number of expert predictions that
accurately reflect the expert's capabilities are required -- in addition to the
ground truth labels needed to train the AI. This requirement shared by many
learning to defer algorithms hinders their adoption in scenarios where the
responsible expert regularly changes or where acquiring a sufficient number of
expert predictions is costly. In this paper, we propose a three-step approach
to reduce the number of expert predictions required to train learning to defer
algorithms. It encompasses (1) the training of an embedding model with ground
truth labels to generate feature representations that serve as a basis for (2)
the training of an expertise predictor model to approximate the expert's
capabilities. (3) The expertise predictor generates artificial expert
predictions for instances not yet labeled by the expert, which are required by
the learning to defer algorithms. We evaluate our approach on two public
datasets. One with ""synthetically"" generated human experts and another from the
medical domain containing real-world radiologists' predictions. Our experiments
show that the approach allows the training of various learning to defer
algorithms with a minimal number of human expert predictions. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that even a small number of expert predictions per class is
sufficient for these algorithms to exceed the performance the AI and the human
expert can achieve individually.

method mostly used is the Method of Moments (MoM). The model assumption that
all individuals have the same evaluation function, however, is one of its
limitations. The aim of this paper is to generalize the MoM estimation method
for the SAOM to include random effects, so that the heterogeneity of
individuals can be modelled more accurately.
  The linear evaluation function that models the probability of forming or
removing a tie from the network, is decomposed in a fixed part, which is the
current evaluation function of the SAOM, and a random part, with parameters
that are individual-specific and random. The Robbins-Monro algorithm that is
commonly used for MoM estimation in the SAOM, is extended to allow the
estimation of the variance of the random parameters. We illustrate how for the

faults from vibration signals. For this, several time- and frequency-domain
features have been proposed already in the past. However, these features are
usually evaluated on data originating from relatively simple scenarios and a
significant performance loss can be observed if more realistic scenarios are
considered. To overcome this, we introduce Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients
(MFCCs) and features extracted from the Amplitude Modulation Spectrogram (AMS)
as features for the detection of bearing faults. Both AMS and MFCCs were
originally introduced in the context of audio signal processing but it is
demonstrated that a significantly improved classification performance can be
obtained by using these features. Furthermore, to tackle the characteristic
data imbalance problem in the context of bearing fault detection, i.e.,
typically much more data from healthy bearings than from damaged bearings is
available, we propose to train a One-class \ac{SVM} with data from healthy
bearings only. Bearing faults are then classified by the detection of outliers.
Our approach is evaluated with data measured in a highly challenging scenario
comprising a state-of-the-art commuter railway engine which is supplied by an
industrial power converter and coupled to a load machine.

systems on Earth. While the exact mechanism that led to homochirality is still
not fully understood, any realistic scenario on the origins of life needs to
address the emergence of homochirality. In order to impose and maintain
chirality in a prebiotic network, an environmental factor functioning as a
chiral agent is demanded. Magnetized surfaces are prebiotically plausible
chiral agents, shown to be effective in enantioseparation of
ribose-aminooxazoline (RAO), a ribonucleic acid (RNA) precursor, due to the
chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. As such, mechanisms for breaking
the magnetic symmetry of magnetic minerals are of the utmost importance. Here
we report the avalanche magnetization of magnetite $(Fe_{3}O_{4})$ by the
crystallization of enantiopure RAO. The observed breaking of the magnetic
symmetry is induced by the chiral molecules due to the CISS effect and spreads
out across the magnetic surface like an avalanche, providing a way to uniformly
magnetize a magnetic surface without fully covering it. Considered together
with our previous results on enantioseparation by crystallization on a magnetic
surface, chirality-induced avalanche magnetization paves the way for a
cooperative feedback between chiral molecules and magnetic surfaces. With this
feedback, a weak natural bias in the net magnetization can be amplified and
spin-selective processes can be accommodated on magnetic minerals on a
persistent basis.

low-complexity and scalable FOTS technology is crucial for building a
large-scale time synchronization network. However, the traditional two-way FOTS
method needs a data layer to exchange time delay information. This increases
the complexity of system and makes it impossible to realize multiple-access
time synchronization. In this paper, a time reversal enabled FOTS method is
proposed. It measures the clock difference between two locations without
involving a data layer, which can reduce the complexity of the system.
Moreover, it can also achieve multiple-access time synchronization along the
fiber link. Tests over a 230 km fiber link have been carried out to demonstrate
the high performance of the proposed method.

the precision of the localization in the Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Indoor
Positioning System (IPS). Numerous supervised Machine Learning (ML) approaches
have been applied for NLoS identification to improve the accuracy of the IPS.
However, it is difficult for existing ML approaches to maintain a high
classification accuracy when the database contains a small number of NLoS
signals and a large number of Line-of-Sight (LoS) signals. The inaccurate
localization of the target node caused by this small number of NLoS signals can
still be problematic. To solve this issue, we propose feature-based Gaussian
Distribution (GD) and Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD) NLoS detection
algorithms. By employing our detection algorithm for the imbalanced dataset, a
classification accuracy of $96.7\%$ and $98.0\%$ can be achieved. We also
compared the proposed algorithm with the existing cutting-edge such as
Support-Vector-Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), and Neural
Network (NN), which can achieve an accuracy of $92.6\%$, $92.8\%$, $93.2\%$,
and $95.5\%$, respectively. The results demonstrate that the GGD algorithm can
achieve high classification accuracy with the imbalanced dataset. Finally, the
proposed algorithm can also achieve a higher classification accuracy for
different ratios of LoS and NLoS signals which proves the robustness and
effectiveness of the proposed method.

counter that, many non-profit organizations have emerged in this domain, such
as MITRE and OSWAP, which have been actively tracking vulnerabilities, and
publishing defense recommendations in standardized formats. As producing data
in such formats manually is very time-consuming, there have been some proposals
to automate the process. Unfortunately, a major obstacle to adopting supervised
machine learning for this problem has been the lack of publicly available
specialized datasets. Here, we aim to bridge this gap. In particular, we focus
on mapping CVE records into MITRE CWE Weaknesses, and we release to the
research community a manually annotated dataset of 4,012 records for this task.
With a human-in-the-loop framework in mind, we approach the problem as a
ranking task and aim to incorporate reinforced learning to make use of the
human feedback in future work. Our experimental results using fine-tuned deep
learning models, namely Sentence-BERT and rankT5, show sizable performance
gains over BM25, BERT, and RoBERTa, which demonstrates the need for an
architecture capable of good semantic understanding for this task.

In doing so,
they need to employ mental models of these objects and often exploit symmetries
in the object's shape and appearance in order to learn generalizable and
transferable skills. Active inference is a first principles approach to
understanding and modeling sentient agents. It states that agents entertain a
generative model of their environment, and learn and act by minimizing an upper
bound on their surprisal, i.e. their Free Energy. The Free Energy decomposes
into an accuracy and complexity term, meaning that agents favor the least
complex model, that can accurately explain their sensory observations. In this
paper, we investigate how inherent symmetries of particular objects also emerge
as symmetries in the latent state space of the generative model learnt under
deep active inference. In particular, we focus on object-centric
representations, which are trained from pixels to predict novel object views as
the agent moves its viewpoint. First, we investigate the relation between model
complexity and symmetry exploitation in the state space. Second, we do a
principal component analysis to demonstrate how the model encodes the principal
axis of symmetry of the object in the latent space. Finally, we also
demonstrate how more symmetrical representations can be exploited for better
generalization in the context of manipulation.

hallmark of molecular electronics for the past two decades. A fast and
efficient charge transfer mechanism with programmable properties using DNA
nanostructures is required for DNA-based nanoelectronics applications and
devices. The ability to integrate DNA with inorganic substrates becomes
critical in this process. Such integrations may effect the conformation of DNA,
altering the charge transport properties. Thus, using molecular dynamics
simulations and first-principles calculations in conjunction with Greens
function approach, we explore the impact of Au (111) substrate on the
conformation of DNA and analyze its effect on the charge transport. Our results
indicate that DNA sequence, leading its molecular conformation on Au substrate,
is critical to engineer charge transport properties. We demonstrate that DNA
can fluctuate on a gold substrate, sampling various distinct conformations over
time. The energy levels, spatial locations of molecular orbitals and the DNA/Au
contact atoms can differ between these distinct conformations. Depending on the
sequence, at HOMO, the charge transmission differs up to 60 times between the
top ten conformations. We demonstrate that the relative positions of the
nucleobases are critical in determining the conformations and the coupling
between orbitals. We anticipate these results can be extended to other
inorganic surfaces and pave the way for understanding DNA inorganic interface
interaction for future DNA-based electronic devices.

analysis is developed by separating the error terms with and without
convergence to zero, which are the key parts of the iterative approximate
value. The proposed method leads to a state-of-the-art wordlength reduction for
intermediate results during the Goldschmidt iterative computation. It enables
at least half of the calculation precision reduction for the iterative factor
to implement the rectangular multiplier in the divider through flexible
numerical method, which can also be applied in the analysis of Goldschmidt
iteration with iterative factors assigned under other ways for faster
convergence. Based on the proposed method, two proof-of-concept divider models
with different configurations are developed, which are verified by more than
100 billion random test vectors to show the correctness and tightness of the
proposed error analysis.

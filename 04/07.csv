  via Swendsen--Wang dynamics","33 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.PR cs.DS math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sampling from the $q$-state ferromagnetic Potts model is a fundamental
question in statistical physics, probability theory, and theoretical computer
science. On general graphs, this problem is computationally hard, and this
hardness holds at arbitrarily low temperatures. At the same time, in recent
years, there has been significant progress showing the existence of
low-temperature sampling algorithms in various specific families of graphs. Our
aim in this paper is to understand the minimal structural properties of general
graphs that enable polynomial-time sampling from the $q$-state ferromagnetic
Potts model at low temperatures. We study this problem from the perspective of
the widely-used Swendsen--Wang dynamics and the closely related random-cluster
dynamics.
  Our results demonstrate that the key graph property behind fast or slow
convergence time for these dynamics is whether the independent edge-percolation
on the graph admits a strongly supercritical phase. By this, we mean that at
large $p<1$, it has a unique giant component of linear size, and the complement
of that giant component is comprised of only small components. Specifically, we
prove that such a condition implies fast mixing of the Swendsen--Wang and
random-cluster dynamics on two general families of bounded-degree graphs: (a)
graphs of at most stretched-exponential volume growth and (b) locally treelike
graphs. In the other direction, we show that, even among graphs in those
families, these Markov chains can converge exponentially slowly at arbitrarily
low temperatures if the edge-percolation condition does not hold. In the
process, we develop new tools for the analysis of non-local Markov chains,
including a framework to bound the speed of disagreement propagation in the
presence of long-range correlations, and an understanding of spatial mixing
properties on trees with random boundary conditions.

(TA) over infinite timed words. History-deterministic (HD) automata are those
in which nondeterminism can be resolved on the fly, based on the run

different game-based characterisations, and HD specifications allow for
game-based verification without an expensive determinization step.
  We show that the class of timed $\omega$-languages recognised by HD timed
automata strictly extends that of deterministic ones, and is strictly included
in those recognised by fully non-deterministic TA. For non-deterministic timed
automata it is known that universality is already undecidable for B\""uchi TA.
For history-deterministic TA with arbitrary parity acceptance, we show that
timed universality, inclusion, and synthesis all remain decidable and are
EXPTIME-complete. For the subclass of TA with safety or reachability
acceptance, one can decide (in EXPTIME) whether such an automaton is
history-deterministic. If so, it can effectively determinized without
introducing new automata states.

Whittle--Mat\'ern fields, are Markov if and only if $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}$, and
if $\alpha\in\mathbb{N}$, the field is Markov of order $\alpha$, which
essentially means that the process in one region $S\subset\Gamma$ is

approach paired with a dissipative filter kernel is shown to restrict scale
generation in the fluid equations via dispersive effects; meanwhile, solution
filtering (SF) -- and artificial dissipation (AD), by extension -- operates

Discrete filters (i.e., the Top-hat and implicit Tangent schemes) are analyzed
in terms of their response characteristics and their associated effects on
reducing small-scale activity when paired with the RF versus SF approaches.
Linear theoretical assessments (e.g., von Neumann analysis) are shown to

large-size convolutional kernels. Therefore, we propose a novel attention
mechanism called Receptive-Field Attention (RFA). Existing spatial attention,
such as Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Coordinated Attention

of convolutional kernel parameter sharing. In contrast, RFA not only focuses on
the receptive-field spatial feature but also provides effective attention
weights for large-size convolutional kernels. The Receptive-Field Attention
convolutional operation (RFAConv), developed by RFA, represents a new approach
to replace the standard convolution operation. It offers nearly negligible
increment of computational cost and parameters, while significantly improving
network performance. We conducted a series of experiments on ImageNet-1k, COCO,

importance, we believe that it is time to shift focus from spatial features to
receptive-field spatial features for current spatial attention mechanisms. In
this way, we can further improve network performance and achieve even better

user identity authentication to establish the authenticity of both sender and

approach for end-to-end feature selection that scales well with respect to both
the feature dimension and the number of samples. At the heart of SLM lies a
simple but effective learnable sparse mask, which learns which features to
select, and gives rise to a novel objective that provably maximizes the mutual
information (MI) between the selected features and the labels, which can be
derived from a quadratic relaxation of mutual information from first
principles. In addition, we derive a scaling mechanism that allows SLM to
precisely control the number of features selected, through a novel use of
sparsemax. This allows for more effective learning as demonstrated in ablation

systems consisting of two modes that are tuned by two control parameters and

Towards this end, recent deep learning-based medical segmentation methods have

operators for medical segmentation typically operate on regular grids, which
inherently blur the high-frequency regions, i.e., boundary regions. In this
work, we propose MORSE, a generic implicit neural rendering framework designed
at an anatomical level to assist learning in medical image segmentation. Our
method is motivated by the fact that implicit neural representation has been
shown to be more effective in fitting complex signals and solving computer
graphics problems than discrete grid-based representation. The core of our
approach is to formulate medical image segmentation as a rendering problem in
an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we continuously align the coarse
segmentation prediction with the ambiguous coordinate-based point
representations and aggregate these features to adaptively refine the boundary
region. To parallelly optimize multi-scale pixel-level features, we leverage
the idea from Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) to design and train our MORSE with a
stochastic gating mechanism. Our experiments demonstrate that MORSE can work
well with different medical segmentation backbones, consistently achieving
competitive performance improvements in both 2D and 3D supervised medical
segmentation methods. We also theoretically analyze the superiority of MORSE.

approaches or high-level objectives (e.g., non-discrimination in regards to
protected attributes, such as sex, gender, or race). However, algorithms may
show bias with respect to various attributes beyond the more obvious ones, and
integrity issues related to these more subtle attributes can have serious
consequences. To enable the generation of actionable, data-driven hypotheses
which identify specific dataset attributes likely to induce model bias, we
contribute a first technique for the rigorous, quantitative screening of
medical image datasets. Drawing from literature in the causal inference and
information theory domains, our procedure decomposes the risks associated with
dataset attributes in terms of their detectability and utility (defined as the

demonstrate the effectiveness and sensitivity of our method, we develop a

between energy localization and the temporal evolution of parity-defined
quantum superpositions is investigated for fermions in a magnetic field. The
unitary evolution of Dirac cat states is obtained by initializing either even
or odd principal quantum numbers in the equivalent harmonic oscillator basis in
relativistic Landau levels. Quantum operators feature well-defined selection
rules for states thus identified, exhibiting a permanent revival structure. Our
analysis is specialized for the survival probability function and for the
expectation values of spinor matrix operators, which are identified as
quantifiers of spin-parity correlations encoded in Dirac bispinors. In such a
context, the time evolving quantum state also imprints a signature on the
energy expansion. Namely, frequencies associated with revivals are doubled for
each revival order, being observed up to a so-called super revival time scale.
Results show that Dirac cat states exhibit a fractional revival structure,
which works as a probe of suppressions and regenerations of intrinsic
correlations driven by the discrete spin-parity degrees of freedom of Dirac
bispinors.

From the simulations, it is observed that the presented hybrid approach is able

  of Immortal Risk",,,,,"stat.ME cs.LG stat.AP stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Observational studies of recurrent event rates are common in biomedical
statistics. Broadly, the goal is to estimate differences in event rates under
two treatments within a defined target population over a specified followup
window. Estimation with observational claims data is challenging because while
membership in the target population is defined in terms of eligibility
criteria, treatment is rarely assigned exactly at the time of eligibility.
Ad-hoc solutions to this timing misalignment, such as assigning treatment at
eligibility based on subsequent assignment, incorrectly attribute prior event
rates to treatment - resulting in immortal risk bias. Even if eligibility and
treatment are aligned, a terminal event process (e.g. death) often stops the
recurrent event process of interest. Both processes are also censored so that
events are not observed over the entire followup window. Our approach addresses
misalignment by casting it as a treatment switching problem: some patients are
on treatment at eligibility while others are off treatment but may switch to
treatment at a specified time - if they survive long enough. We define and
identify an average causal effect of switching under specified causal
assumptions. Estimation is done using a g-computation framework with a joint
semiparametric Bayesian model for the death and recurrent event processes.
Computing the estimand for various switching times allows us to assess the
impact of treatment timing. We apply the method to contrast hospitalization
rates under different opioid treatment strategies among patients with chronic
back pain using Medicare claims data.

source and $n$ receiver nodes. The source updates itself with a Poisson process
and also sends updates to the nodes as Poisson arrivals. Upon receiving the
updates, the nodes update their knowledge about the source. The nodes gossip
the data among themselves in the form of Poisson arrivals to disperse their
knowledge about the source. The total gossiping rate is bounded by a
constraint. The goal of the network is to be as timely as possible with the
source. We propose a scheme which we coin \emph{age sense updating multiple
access in networks (ASUMAN)}, which is a distributed opportunistic gossiping
scheme, where after each time the source updates itself, each node waits for a
time proportional to its current age and broadcasts a signal to the other nodes
of the network. This allows the nodes in the network which have higher age to
remain silent and only the low-age nodes to gossip, thus utilizing a
significant portion of the constrained total gossip rate. We calculate the
average age for a typical node in such a network with symmetric settings, and
show that the theoretical upper bound on the age scales as $O(1)$. ASUMAN, with
an average age of $O(1)$, offers significant gains compared to a system where
the nodes just gossip blindly with a fixed update rate, in which case the age
scales as $O(\log n)$. Further, we analyzed the performance of ASUMAN for
fractional, finitely connected, sublinear and hierarchical cluster networks.
Finally, we show that the $O(1)$ age scaling can be extended to asymmetric
settings as well. We give an example of power law arrivals, where nodes' ages
scale differently but follow the $O(1)$ bound.

Interestingly, albeit the lower band edge always occurs at wave-vector $k=0$,
the upper band edge may or may not correspond to $k=\pi$. Nonetheless, in all
the cases, the system exhibits universal subdiffusive transport for conductance
at every band edge with scaling $N^{-b}$ with scaling exponent $b= 2$. However,
for cases when the upper band edge is not located at $k=\pi$, the conductance
features interesting oscillations with overall $N^{-2}$ scaling. Our work

galaxy properties of 43 LAEs, and study correlations between stellar mass, star
formation rate (SFR), and dust, to the Lyman-alpha rest-frame equivalent widths

mass and Lyman-alpha EW, and star formation rate (SFR) and Lyman-alpha EW, with
a Spearman correlation coefficient of -0.$34_{-.14}^{+.17}$ and
-0.$37_{-.14}^{+.16}$ respectively. We show that the Lyman-alpha distribution

times the output power is maximized in this regime. In particular, we show that
strong coupling allows one to obtain engines with larger efficiency than their
weakly coupled counterparts, while sharing the same output power. Conversely,
one can design strongly coupled engines with larger power than their weakly
coupled counterparts, while sharing the same efficiency. Overall, our results
provide situations where strong coupling can directly enhance the performance
of thermodynamic operations, re-enforcing the importance of studying quantum
thermal engines beyond standard configurations.

have the same law up to reflection; indeed, the dual tree is the geodesic tree
of the dual landscape as constructed there. We show that the interface between
the two trees is a space filling curve that is naturally parametrized by the

hours or even days of training to mimic a simple motion sequence, resulting in
poor scalability. In this work, we leverage differentiable physics simulators
(DPS) and propose an efficient motion mimicking method dubbed DiffMimic. Our
key insight is that DPS casts a complex policy learning task to a much simpler
state matching problem. In particular, DPS learns a stable policy by analytical
gradients with ground-truth physical priors hence leading to significantly
faster and stabler convergence than RL-based methods. Moreover, to escape from
local optima, we utilize a Demonstration Replay mechanism to enable stable
gradient backpropagation in a long horizon. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks show that DiffMimic has a better sample efficiency and time
efficiency than existing methods (e.g., DeepMimic). Notably, DiffMimic allows a
physically simulated character to learn Backflip after 10 minutes of training
and be able to cycle it after 3 hours of training, while the existing approach
may require about a day of training to cycle Backflip. More importantly, we
hope DiffMimic can benefit more differentiable animation systems with
techniques like differentiable clothes simulation in future research.

We use Meta's Ad Library to collect 602,546 ads that have been issued by US

substantially more on climate change than Republicans, with 99.7% of all
climate-related ads stemming from Democratic politicians. In particular, we
find this is driven by a small core of Democratic politicians, where 72% of all
impressions can be attributed to 10 politicians. Interestingly, we find a
significant difference in the average amount of impressions generated per
dollar spent between the two parties. Republicans generate on average 188% more

build models to explain the differences and find that demographic factors only

compositional synthesis of driving scenes in a physically consistent manner.
Specifically, we learn a scene representation that disentangles the static
background and transient elements into a world-NeRF and class-specific
object-NeRFs to allow compositional synthesis of multiple objects in the scene.
Furthermore, we explicitly designed both the world and object models to handle
lighting variation, which allows us to compose objects into scenes with
spatially varying lighting. This is achieved by constructing a light field of
the scene and using it in conjunction with a learned shader to modulate the
appearance of the object NeRFs. We demonstrate the performance of our model on
a synthetic dataset of diverse lighting conditions rendered with the CARLA

send information following a normalized probability distribution rather than
gathering information in conventional self-attention. With such a design,
hierarchies naturally emerge from reversed attention layers, and a dependency
tree is progressively induced from leaf nodes to the root node unsupervisedly.
  DependencyViT offers several appealing benefits. (i) Entities and their parts
in an image are represented by different subtrees, enabling part partitioning
from dependencies; (ii) Dynamic visual pooling is made possible. The leaf nodes
which rarely send messages can be pruned without hindering the model
performance, based on which we propose the lightweight DependencyViT-Lite to
reduce the computational and memory footprints; (iii) DependencyViT works well

well-motivated problem of a resource foraging agent. Semantic information is
defined as the subset of correlations, measured via the transfer entropy,
between agent $A$ and environment $E$ that is necessary for the agent to
maintain its viability $V$. Viability, in turn, is endogenously defined as
opposed to the use of exogenous quantities like utility functions. In our
model, the forager's movements are determined by its ability to measure, via a
sensor, the presence of an individual unit of resource, while the viability
function is its expected lifetime. Through counterfactual interventions --
scrambling the correlations between agent and environment via noising the
sensor -- we demonstrate the presence of a critical value of the noise
parameter, $\eta_c$, above which the forager's expected lifetime is
dramatically reduced. On the other hand, for $\eta < \eta_c$ there is
little-to-no effect on its ability to survive. We refer to this boundary as the
semantic threshold, quantifying the subset of agent-environment correlations
that the agent actually needs to maintain its desired state of staying alive.
Each bit of information affects the agent's ability to persist both above and
below the semantic threshold. Modeling the viability curve and its semantic
threshold via forager/environment parameters, we show how the correlations are
instantiated. Our work provides a useful model for studies of established
agents in terms of semantic information. It also shows that such semantic
thresholds may prove useful for understanding the role information plays in

spin-momentum locking terms with conserved, commuting pseudospins built from a

low-energy with anomalous charge and pseudospin currents. To cure the anomaly
we show that such anomalous modes can be realized on the surface of a 3D Weyl

Finetuning the pretrained model to achieve strong supervised performance
results in low zero-shot generalization. Similarly, freezing the backbone to
retain zero-shot capability causes significant drop in supervised accuracy.
Because of this, recent works in literature typically train separate models for
supervised and zero-shot action recognition. In this work, we propose a
multimodal prompt learning scheme that works to balance the supervised and
zero-shot performance under a single unified training. Our prompting approach
on the vision side caters for three aspects: 1) Global video-level prompts to
model the data distribution; 2) Local frame-level prompts to provide per-frame
discriminative conditioning; and 3) a summary prompt to extract a condensed
video representation. Additionally, we define a prompting scheme on the text
side to augment the textual context. Through this prompting scheme, we can
achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on Kinetics-600, HMDB51 and
UCF101 while remaining competitive in the supervised setting. By keeping the
pretrained backbone frozen, we optimize a much lower number of parameters and
retain the existing general representation which helps achieve the strong
zero-shot performance. Our codes/models are released at

this class of processes. In the finite-variance case, the limit consists of two
independent components: a fractional Brownian motion arising from the sum, and
a long-range dependent random sup measure arising from the maximum. In the
infinite-variance case, we obtain in the limit two dependent components: a
stable process and a random sup measure whose dependence structure is described
through the local time and range of a stable subordinator. For establishing the
limit theorem in the latter case, we also develop a joint convergence result
for the local time and range of subordinators, which may be of independent
interest.

  Models","30 pages, 18 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Image inpainting refers to the task of generating a complete, natural image
based on a partially revealed reference image. Recently, many research
interests have been focused on addressing this problem using fixed diffusion
models. These approaches typically directly replace the revealed region of the
intermediate or final generated images with that of the reference image or its
variants. However, since the unrevealed regions are not directly modified to
match the context, it results in incoherence between revealed and unrevealed
regions. To address the incoherence problem, a small number of methods
introduce a rigorous Bayesian framework, but they tend to introduce mismatches
between the generated and the reference images due to the approximation errors
in computing the posterior distributions. In this paper, we propose COPAINT,
which can coherently inpaint the whole image without introducing mismatches.
COPAINT also uses the Bayesian framework to jointly modify both revealed and
unrevealed regions, but approximates the posterior distribution in a way that
allows the errors to gradually drop to zero throughout the denoising steps,
thus strongly penalizing any mismatches with the reference image. Our
experiments verify that COPAINT can outperform the existing diffusion-based
methods under both objective and subjective metrics. The codes are available at

  We obtained the detection of FeI, CrI and TiI in the atmosphere of MASCARA-1

equations of motion do not produce unique transonic solution. Following the
second law of thermodynamics the solution with the highest entropy is selected
and thereby eliminating the degeneracy in solution. We study the properties of
these solutions and obtain corresponding spectra as a function of the magnetic
field ($B_*$), spin period ($P$) and accretion rate of the star ($\dot{M}$). A
primary shock is always formed just near the surface. The enhanced radiative
processes in this post-shock region slows down the matter and it finally
settles on the surface of the star. This post-shock region contributes to
$\gtrsim 99.99\%$ of the total luminosity obtained from the accretion flow. It
is still important to study the full accretion flow because secondary shocks
may be present for some combination of $B_*$, $P$ and ${\dot{M}}$ in addition

spintronic physical reservoir. Due to the short-term memory property of the
magnetization dynamics, non-linearity arises in the reservoir states which
could be used for long-term prediction tasks using simple linear regression for
online training. During the prediction stage, the output is directly fed to the
input of the reservoir for autonomous prediction. We employ our proposed
reservoir for the modeling of the chaotic time series such as Mackey-Glass and
dynamic time-series data, such as household building energy loads. Since only
the last layer of a RC needs to be trained with linear regression, it is well
suited for learning in real time on edge devices. Here we show that a skyrmion
based magnetic tunnel junction can potentially be used as a prototypical RC but
any nanomagnetic magnetic tunnel junction with nonlinear magnetization behavior
can implement such a RC. By comparing our spintronic physical RC approach with
state-of-the-art energy load forecasting algorithms, such as LSTMs and RNNs, we
conclude that the proposed framework presents good performance in achieving
high predictions accuracy, while also requiring low memory and energy both of

Additionally, the adjacency matrix ignores user-user and item-item

  In this work, we propose a new graph adjacency matrix that incorporates

To achieve this, we pre-train a graph-based recommendation method to obtain
users/items embeddings, and then enhance the user-item interaction matrix via
top-K sampling. We also augment the symmetric user-user and item-item
correlation components to the adjacency matrix. Our experiments demonstrate
that the enhanced user-item interaction matrix with improved neighbors and
lower density leads to significant benefits in graph-based recommendation.
Moreover, we show that the inclusion of user-user and item-item correlations

the dynamical Higgs phase, with a few simple bi-fermion color-flavor locked
condensates, breaking the color and flavor symmetries, partially or totally.
Remarkably, the 't Hooft anomaly-matching (and generalized anomaly-matching)

error-resilient, the proposed scheme simply delivers gradients with errors when
the channel quality is satisfactory, eliminating extensive error-correcting

lower latency. The proposed scheme is well-suited for resource-constrained

light curve morphologies. We provide a framework for classifying the transients
arising from interaction with a spherical CSM shell. The light curves are
decomposed into five consecutive phases, starting from the onset of interaction
and extending through shock breakout and subsequent shock cooling. The relative
prominence of each phase in the light curve is determined by two dimensionless
quantities representing the CSM-to-ejecta mass ratio $\eta$, and a breakout
parameter $\xi$. These two parameters define four light curve morphology
classes, where each class is characterized by the location of shock breakout
and the degree of deceleration as the shock sweeps up the CSM. We compile
analytic scaling relations connecting the luminosity and duration of each light
curve phase to the physical parameters. We then run a grid of radiation
hydrodynamics simulations for a wide range of ejecta and CSM parameters to
numerically explore the landscape of interaction light curves, and to calibrate
and confirm the analytic scalings. We connect our theoretical framework to

adversarial sequence of requests for resources arrive over time. A resource
that is matched is 'used' for a random duration, drawn independently from a
resource-dependent distribution, after which it returns and is able to be
matched again. We study the performance of the greedy policy, which matches
requests to the resource that yields the highest reward. Previously, it was
known that the greedy policy is 1/2 competitive against a clairvoyant benchmark
that knows the request sequence in advance. In this work, we improve this
result by introducing a parameter that quantifies the degree of reusability of
the resources. Specifically, if p represents the smallest probability over the
usage distributions that a matched resource returns in one time step, the
greedy policy achieves a competitive ratio of $1/(2-p)$. Furthermore, when the
usage distributions are geometric, we establish a stronger competitive ratio of
$(1+p)/2$, which we demonstrate to be tight. Both of these results align with
the known results in the two extreme scenarios: p = 0 corresponds to
non-reusable resources, where 1/2 is known to be tight, while p = 1 corresponds
to every resource returning immediately, where greedy is the optimal policy and
hence the competitive ratio is 1. Finally, we show that both results are robust
to approximations of the greedy policy. Our work demonstrates that the
reusability of resources can enhance performance compared to the non-reusable
setting, and that a simple greedy policy suffices when the degree of
reusability is high. Our insights contribute to the understanding of how
resource reusability can influence the performance of online algorithms, and
highlight the potential for improved performance as the degree of reusability

  to the NTK geometry of training","44 pages, 2 figures, comments welcome",,,,"cs.LG cs.NE math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent developments in applications of artificial neural networks with over
$n=10^{14}$ parameters make it extremely important to study the large $n$
behaviour of such networks. Most works studying wide neural networks have
focused on the infinite width $n \to +\infty$ limit of such networks and have
shown that, at initialization, they correspond to Gaussian processes. In this
work we will study their behavior for large, but finite $n$. Our main
contributions are the following:
  (1) The computation of the corrections to Gaussianity in terms of an
asymptotic series in $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$. The coefficients in this expansion are
determined by the statistics of parameter initialization and by the activation
function.
  (2) Controlling the evolution of the outputs of finite width $n$ networks,
during training, by computing deviations from the limiting infinite width case
(in which the network evolves through a linear flow). This improves previous
estimates and yields sharper decay rates for the (finite width) NTK in terms of
$n$, valid during the entire training procedure. As a corollary, we also prove
that, with arbitrarily high probability, the training of sufficiently wide
neural networks converges to a global minimum of the corresponding quadratic
loss function.
  (3) Estimating how the deviations from Gaussianity evolve with training in
terms of $n$. In particular, using a certain metric in the space of measures we
find that, along training, the resulting measure is within
$n^{-\frac{1}{2}}(\log n)^{1+}$ of the time dependent Gaussian process
corresponding to the infinite width network (which is explicitly given by
precomposing the initial Gaussian process with the linear flow corresponding to
training in the infinite width limit).

endanger intellectual property, data privacy, and security. Previous research
has shown that system-level side-channels can be used to leak the architecture
of a victim DNN, exacerbating these risks. We propose two DNN architecture
extraction techniques catering to various threat models. The first technique
uses a malicious, dynamically linked version of PyTorch to expose a victim DNN
architecture through the PyTorch profiler. The second, called EZClone, exploits
aggregate (rather than time-series) GPU profiles as a side-channel to predict
DNN architecture, employing a simple approach and assuming little adversary
capability as compared to previous work. We investigate the effectiveness of
EZClone when minimizing the complexity of the attack, when applied to pruned
models, and when applied across GPUs. We find that EZClone correctly predicts
DNN architectures for the entire set of PyTorch vision architectures with 100%
accuracy. No other work has shown this degree of architecture prediction
accuracy with the same adversarial constraints or using aggregate side-channel
information. Prior work has shown that, once a DNN has been successfully
cloned, further attacks such as model evasion or model inversion can be

actual underlying reasons for the prediction in the image. For image-text

not present in the query image. In this work, we introduce ODmAP@k, an object
decorrelation metric that measures a model's robustness to spurious

manipulations to control the presence of such object correlations in designated
test data. Additionally, our data synthesis technique is used to tackle model
biases due to spurious correlations of semantically unrelated objects in the

image-text retrieval frameworks on carefully designed synthetic data, to three

improvements for all three models, both in terms of the standard retrieval

frameworks. Because PBT is intended to test deep semantic and structural
properties of a program, the outputs produced by these generators can be
complex data structures, constrained to satisfy properties the developer
believes is most relevant to testing the function of interest. An important
feature expected of these generators is that they be capable of producing all
acceptable elements that satisfy the function's input type and
generator-provided constraints. However, it is not readily apparent how we
might validate whether a particular generator's output satisfies this coverage

post-mortem analysis of test runs to determine if the generator is providing
sufficient coverage; these approaches are error-prone and difficult to scale as
generators become more complex. To address this important concern, we present a
new refinement type-based verification procedure for validating the coverage
provided by input test generators, based on a novel interpretation of types

the various design and analysis options together with variance calculations
that take the two-phase sampling into account. This work clarifies when the
widely used ""robust"" variance estimate of Barlow is appropriate. The
corresponding R software, CaseCohortCoxSurvival, facilitates analysis with and
without stratification and/or weight calibration, for subcohort sampling with

random for stratified designs. We provide inference not only for log relative

approach involves identifying Super-pixels by Felzenszwalb's algorithm and
performing local contrastive learning using a novel contrastive sampling loss.
Through extensive experiments on three multi-organ segmentation datasets, we

description of infinite width deep neural network kernel and prediction
dynamics, we provide a characterization of the
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{\text{width}})$ fluctuations of the DMFT order parameters
over random initializations of the network weights. Our results, while
perturbative in width, unlike prior analyses, are non-perturbative in the
strength of feature learning. In the lazy limit of network training, all
kernels are random but static in time and the prediction variance has a
universal form. However, in the rich, feature learning regime, the fluctuations
of the kernels and predictions are dynamically coupled with a variance that can
be computed self-consistently. In two layer networks, we show how feature
learning can dynamically reduce the variance of the final tangent kernel and
final network predictions. We also show how initialization variance can slow
down online learning in wide but finite networks. In deeper networks, kernel
variance can dramatically accumulate through subsequent layers at large feature
learning strengths, but feature learning continues to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio of the feature kernels. In discrete time, we demonstrate
that large learning rate phenomena such as edge of stability effects can be
well captured by infinite width dynamics and that initialization variance can
decrease dynamically. For CNNs trained on CIFAR-10, we empirically find
significant corrections to both the bias and variance of network dynamics due
to finite width.

properties such as non-magnetic nematic order and its quantum critical point.
The nature of superconductivity with such nematicity is important for
understanding the mechanism of unconventional superconductivity. A recent
theory suggested the possible emergence of a fundamentally new class of
superconductivity with the so-called Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) in this
system. However, such an {\em ultranodal} pair state requires broken
time-reversal symmetry (TRS) in the superconducting state, which has not been
observed experimentally. Here we report muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR)
measurements in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ superconductors for $0\le x \le 0.22$
covering both orthorhombic (nematic) and tetragonal phases. We find that the
zero-field muon relaxation rate is enhanced below the superconducting
transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ for all compositions, indicating that the
superconducting state breaks TRS both in the nematic and tetragonal phases.
Moreover, the transverse-field $\mu$SR measurements reveal that the superfluid
density shows an unexpected and substantial reduction in the tetragonal phase
($x>0.17$). This implies that a significant fraction of electrons remain
unpaired in the zero-temperature limit, which cannot be explained by the known
unconventional superconducting states with point or line nodes. The
time-reversal symmetry breaking and the suppressed superfluid density in the
tetragonal phase, together with the reported enhanced zero-energy excitations,
are consistent with the ultranodal pair state with BFSs. The present results
reveal two different superconducting states with broken TRS separated by the
nematic critical point in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$, which calls for the theory of
microscopic origins that account for the relation between the nematicity and
superconductivity.

The proposed reranking module takes feature correlation, attention value, and
xy coordinates into account, and learns to determine whether the image pair is
from the same location. The whole pipeline is end-to-end trainable and the
reranking module alone can also be adopted on other CNN or transformer
backbones as a generic component. Remarkably, $R^{2}$Former significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on major VPR datasets with much less
inference time and memory consumption. It also achieves the state-of-the-art on

covering a certain topic. The process inevitably exhibits selection biases,
i.e. news sources' typical patterns of choosing what information to include in
news coverage, due to their agenda differences. To understand the magnitude and
implications of selection biases, one must first discover (1) on what topics do
sources typically have diverging definitions of ""newsworthy"" information, and
(2) do the content selection patterns correlate with certain attributes of the
news sources, e.g. ideological leaning, etc.
  The goal of the paper is to investigate and discuss the challenges of
building scalable NLP systems for discovering patterns of media selection
biases directly from news content in massive-scale news corpora, without
relying on labeled data. To facilitate research in this domain, we propose and
study a conceptual framework, where we compare how sources typically mention
certain controversial entities, and use such as indicators for the sources'
content selection preferences. We empirically show the capabilities of the
framework through a case study on NELA-2020, a corpus of 1.8M news articles in
English from 519 news sources worldwide. We demonstrate an unsupervised
representation learning method to capture the selection preferences for how
sources typically mention controversial entities. Our experiments show that
that distributional divergence of such representations, when studied
collectively across entities and news sources, serve as good indicators for an
individual source's ideological leaning. We hope our findings will provide
insights for future research on media selection biases.

ground-state equilibrium solutions of the Schr\""odinger-Poisson system, the
relaxation of a Gaussian density fluctuation, mergers of two equilibrium
configurations, and the random merger of many solitons. For comparison, each
scenario is evolved twice, with isolation boundary conditions and periodic
boundary conditions, the two commonly used to simulate isolated systems and
structure formation, respectively. Replacing isolation boundary conditions by
periodic boundary conditions changes the domain topology and dynamics of each
scenario, by affecting the outcome of gravitational cooling. With periodic
boundary conditions, the ground-state equilibrium solution and Gaussian
fluctuation each evolve toward the single equilibrium solitonic core of the
isolated case, but surrounded by a tail, unlike the isolated versions. The case
of head-on, binary mergers illustrates additional effects, caused by the pull
suffered by the system due to the infinite network of periodic images along
each direction of the domain. Binary merger with angular momentum is the first
scenario we found in which the tail has a polynomial profile when using a
periodic domain. Finally, the 3D merger of many, randomly-placed solitonic
cores of different mass makes a solitonic core surrounded by a tail with
power-law-like density profile, for periodic boundary conditions, while
producing a core with a much sharper fall-off in the isolated case. This
suggests that the conclusion of earlier work that the ground-state equilibrium
solution is an attractor for the asymptotic state is true even in 3D and for
general circumstances, but only if gravitational cooling is able to carry mass
and energy off to infinity, which isolation boundary conditions allow, but
periodic ones do not.

fluctuating black holes that are in contact with thermal baths at an arbitrary
ensemble temperature, resulting in the corresponding Euclidean geometry with a
conical singularity at the event horizon. By properly regularizing the conical
singularity, we have derived the generalized free energy of the fluctuating
black holes in the canonical ensemble using the Euclidean gravitational path

consistent with the definition from thermodynamic perspective. Then we explore
the free energy landscapes of the charge Gauss-Bonnet black holes in diverse

with two assets - risky bonds and risk-free cash. Within periods, given the
inherited distribution of wealth across belief types, the scale and terms of
borrowing are endogenously determined. Following good states, aggregate
borrowing and the face value of debt both rise, and the interest rate falls. In
the absence of noise, wealth converges to beliefs that differ systematically

reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate
generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by
The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents
using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce
believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with
only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's

algorithms, the widespread adoption of AI-generated content (AIGC) has emerged,
allowing for the generation of diverse and high-quality content. Especially,
the diffusion model-based AIGC technique has been widely used to generate
content in a variety of modalities. However, the real-world implementation of
AIGC models, particularly on resource-constrained devices such as mobile
phones, introduces significant challenges related to energy consumption and
privacy concerns. To further promote the realization of ubiquitous AIGC
services, we propose a novel collaborative distributed diffusion-based AIGC
framework. By capitalizing on collaboration among devices in wireless networks,
the proposed framework facilitates the efficient execution of AIGC tasks,
optimizing edge computation resource utilization. Furthermore, we examine the
practical implementation of the denoising steps on mobile phones, the impact of
the proposed approach on the wireless network-aided AIGC landscape, and the
future opportunities associated with its real-world integration. The
contributions of this paper not only offer a promising solution to the existing
limitations of AIGC services but also pave the way for future research in
device collaboration, resource optimization, and the seamless delivery of AIGC

the concept of delegation of quantum computations and its verifiability is of
central interest. Many models have been proposed, each with specific strengths
and weaknesses. Here, we put forth a new model where the client trusts only its
classical processing, makes no computational assumptions, and interacts with a
quantum server in a single round. In addition, during a set-up phase, the
client specifies the size $n$ of the computation and receives an untrusted,
off-the-shelf (OTS) quantum device that is used to report the outcome of a
single constant-sized measurement from a predetermined logarithmic-sized input.
In the OTS model, we thus picture that a single quantum server does the bulk of
the computations, while the OTS device is used as an untrusted and generic
verification device, all in a single round.
  We show how to delegate polynomial-time quantum computations in the OTS
model. Scaling up the technique also yields an interactive proof system for all
of QMA, which, furthermore, we show can be accomplished in statistical
zero-knowledge. This yields the first relativistic (one-round), two-prover
zero-knowledge proof system for QMA.
  As a proof approach, we provide a new self-test for $n$-EPR pairs using only
constant-sized Pauli measurements, and show how it provides a new avenue for
the use of simulatable codes for local Hamiltonian verification. Along the way,
we also provide an enhanced version of a well-known stability result due to
Gowers and Hatami and show how it completes a common argument used in
self-testing.

ImageNet) and transfer learning (TL) to various downstream datasets are
commonly employed to evaluate the quality of visual representations learned via
self-supervised learning (SSL). Although existing SSL methods have shown good
performances under those evaluation protocols, we observe that the performances
are very sensitive to the hyperparameters involved in LP and TL. We argue that
this is an undesirable behavior since truly generic representations should be
easily adapted to any other visual recognition task, i.e., the learned
representations should be robust to the settings of LP and TL hyperparameters.
In this work, we try to figure out the cause of performance sensitivity by
conducting extensive experiments with state-of-the-art SSL methods. First, we
find that input normalization for LP is crucial to eliminate performance
variations according to the hyperparameters. Specifically, batch normalization
before feeding inputs to a linear classifier considerably improves the
stability of evaluation, and also resolves inconsistency of $k$-NN and LP
metrics. Second, for TL, we demonstrate that a weight decay parameter in SSL
significantly affects the transferability of learned representations, which
cannot be identified by LP or $k$-NN evaluations on the upstream dataset. We
believe that the findings of this study will be beneficial for the community by
drawing attention to the shortcomings in the current SSL evaluation schemes and
underscoring the need to reconsider them.

  Methods: A pulse sequence was developed by interleaving inversion recovery
and T2 magnetization preparations and single-echo and multi-echo gradient echo
acquisitions, which sensitized k-space data to T1, T2, T2* and magnetic
susceptibility. The proposed mcLARO used a deep learning framework to optimize
both the multi-contrast k-space under-sampling pattern and the image
reconstruction based on image feature fusion. The proposed mcLARO method with
R=8 under-sampling was validated in a retrospective ablation study using fully
sampled data as reference and evaluated in a prospective study using separately
acquired conventionally sampled quantitative maps as reference standard.
  Results: The retrospective ablation study showed improved image sharpness of
mcLARO compared to the baseline network without multi-contrast sampling pattern
optimization or image feature fusion, and negligible bias and narrow 95% limits
of agreement on regional T1, T2, T2* and QSM values were obtained by the
under-sampled reconstructions compared to the fully sampled reconstruction. The
prospective study showed small or negligible bias and narrow 95% limits of

solar jets during Solar Cycle 24. Power-law distributions have been revealed
between the intensity/energy and frequency of these events, with indices found
to be analogous to those for flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These
jets are also found to be spatially and temporally modulated by the solar cycle
forming a butterfly diagram in their latitudinal-temporal evolution,
experiencing quasi-annual oscillations in their analysed properties, and very
likely gathering in certain active longitudinal belts. Our results show that
coronal jets display the same nonlinear behaviour as that observed in flares
and CMEs, in solar and stellar atmospheres, strongly suggesting that they
result from the same nonlinear statistics of scale-free processes as their
counterparts in different scales of eruptive events. Although these jets, like
flares and other large-scale dynamic phenomena, are found to be significantly
modulated by the solar cycle, their corresponding power-law indices still
remain similar.

  New Datasets and A New Method","11 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The development of knowledge graph (KG) applications has led to a rising need
for entity alignment (EA) between heterogeneous KGs that are extracted from
various sources. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely
adopted in EA tasks due to GNNs' impressive ability to capture structure
information. However, we have observed that the oversimplified settings of the
existing common EA datasets are distant from real-world scenarios, which
obstructs a full understanding of the advancements achieved by recent methods.
This phenomenon makes us ponder: Do existing GNN-based EA methods really make
great progress?
  In this paper, to study the performance of EA methods in realistic settings,
we focus on the alignment of highly heterogeneous KGs (HHKGs) (e.g., event KGs
and general KGs) which are different with regard to the scale and structure,
and share fewer overlapping entities. First, we sweep the unreasonable
settings, and propose two new HHKG datasets that closely mimic real-world EA
scenarios. Then, based on the proposed datasets, we conduct extensive
experiments to evaluate previous representative EA methods, and reveal
interesting findings about the progress of GNN-based EA methods. We find that
the structural information becomes difficult to exploit but still valuable in
aligning HHKGs. This phenomenon leads to inferior performance of existing EA
methods, especially GNN-based methods. Our findings shed light on the potential
problems resulting from an impulsive application of GNN-based methods as a
panacea for all EA datasets. Finally, we introduce a simple but effective
method: Simple-HHEA, which comprehensively utilizes entity name, structure, and
temporal information. Experiment results show Simple-HHEA outperforms previous
models on HHKG datasets.

Analysis (PCA) with K-means and Gaussian Mixture (GM) clustering methods from
Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to identify structural and dynamical
heterogeneities of supercooled liquids is developed. In this method, a
collection of the average weighted coordination numbers ($\overline{WCNs}$) of
particles calculated from particles' positions are used as an order parameter
to build a low-dimensional representation of feature (structural) space for
K-means clustering to sort the particles in the system into few meso-states
using PCA. Nano-domains or aggregated clusters are also formed in
configurational (real) space from a direct mapping using associated
meso-states' particle identities with some misclassified interfacial particles.
These classification uncertainties can be improved by a co-learning strategy
which utilizes the probabilistic GM clustering and the information transfer
between the structural space and configurational space iteratively until
convergence. A final classification of meso-states in structural space and
domains in configurational space are stable over long times and measured to
have dynamical heterogeneities. Armed with such a classification protocol,
various studies over the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of these
domains indicate that the observed heterogeneity is the result of liquid-liquid
phase separation after quenching to a supercooled state.

study results in an active-controlled trial like HPTN 084 is that the placebo

Deconvolution of the core level spectra (O 1s, Sr 3d and Ti 2p) distinguishes
bulk and surface components, which are interpreted in terms of surface enhanced
covalency (SEC). By comparing the experimentally measured binding energies with
theoretical calculations developed in the framework of the Localized-Hole

the surface by {\Delta}EM. {\Delta}EM is a minimum for the (111) surface, and
increases through (100), attaining a maximum for (110). The angle-resolved

due to its ability to model long-range dependency. However, ViT requires a
large amount of computing resource to compute the global self-attention. In
this work, we propose a ladder self-attention block with multiple branches and
a progressive shift mechanism to develop a light-weight transformer backbone
that requires less computing resources (e.g. a relatively small number of
parameters and FLOPs), termed Progressive Shift Ladder Transformer (PSLT).
First, the ladder self-attention block reduces the computational cost by
modelling local self-attention in each branch. In the meanwhile, the
progressive shift mechanism is proposed to enlarge the receptive field in the
ladder self-attention block by modelling diverse local self-attention for each
branch and interacting among these branches. Second, the input feature of the
ladder self-attention block is split equally along the channel dimension for
each branch, which considerably reduces the computational cost in the ladder
self-attention block (with nearly 1/3 the amount of parameters and FLOPs), and
the outputs of these branches are then collaborated by a pixel-adaptive fusion.
Therefore, the ladder self-attention block with a relatively small number of
parameters and FLOPs is capable of modelling long-range interactions. Based on
the ladder self-attention block, PSLT performs well on several vision tasks,
including image classification, objection detection and person
re-identification. On the ImageNet-1k dataset, PSLT achieves a top-1 accuracy
of 79.9% with 9.2M parameters and 1.9G FLOPs, which is comparable to several
existing models with more than 20M parameters and 4G FLOPs. Code is available

the performance of the proposed method for smaller {\delta} values generally

fail to capture features that are crucial for exposing parallelism. In this
paper, we introduce a new graph-based program representation for parallel
applications that extends the Abstract Syntax Tree to represent control and
data flow information. The originality of this work lies in the addition of new
edges exploiting the implicit ordering and parent-child relationships in ASTs,
as well as the introduction of edge weights to account for loop and condition

GPUs. Various transformations utilizing collapse and data transfer between the
CPU and GPU are used to construct the dataset. The predicted runtime of the
model is used to determine which transformation provides the best performance.
Results show that our approach is indeed effective and has normalized RMSE as

proposed method is model-free, namely, the system model and the initial states
needn't to be known. Meanwhile, it is suitable for large-scale PBCNs. First, we
establish the connection between deep reinforcement learning and optimal
infinite-horizon control, and structure the problem into the framework of the
Markov decision process. Then, PBCNs are defined as large-scale or small-scale,
depending on whether the memory of the action-values exceeds the RAM of the
computer. Based on the newly introduced definition, Q-learning (QL) and double
deep Q-network (DDQN) are applied to the optimal infinite-horizon control of
small-scale and large-scale PBCNs, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimal state
feedback controllers are designed. Finally, two examples are presented, which
are a small-scale PBCN with 3 nodes, and a large-scale one with 28 nodes. To
verify the convergence of QL and DDQN, the optimal control policy and the
optimal action-values, which are obtained from both the algorithms, are
compared with the ones based on a model-based method named policy iteration.
Meanwhile, the performance of QL is compared with DDQN in the small-scale PBCN.

One popular strategy to build universal models is to encode each task as a
one-hot vector and generate dynamic convolutional layers at the end of the
decoder to extract the interested target. Although successful, it ignores the
correlations among tasks and meanwhile is too late to make the model 'aware' of
the ongoing task. To address both issues, we propose a prompt-driven Universal

describe the correlations among all tasks and then convert this prompt and
image features into a task-specific prompt, which is fed to the decoder as a
part of its input. Thus, we make the model 'aware' of the ongoing task early
and boost the task-specific training of the whole decoder. Our results indicate
that the proposed UniSeg outperforms other universal models and single-task

the future information of a user in the virtual space without any assumptions,
and (2) fuse this information while maneuvering existing RDW methods. The
backbone of the first step is an LSTM-based model that ingests the user's
spatial and eye-tracking data to predict the user's future position in the

existing RDW methods (such as MPCRed, S2C, TAPF, and ARC) while respecting
their internal mechanism in applicable ways.The results of our simulation test

movement of the upper plate and convection arises due to the maintenance of the
temperature difference between the upper plate and the lower plate. The fluid
considered is Newtonian and incompressible. Darcy model is used to narrate the
flow in the porous layer and at the interface, the Beavers-Joseph condition is
used. The Chebyshev collocation method is used to solve the generalized
eigenvalue problem. Here, the effect of anisotropy and inhomogeneity of the
porous medium, along with the ratio of the thickness of fluid to porous layer,
i.e., depth ratio $(\hat{d})$, Reynolds number $(Re)$ and Darcy number
$(\delta)$ are studied. The analysis is carried out majorly for water; however,
the impact of anisotropy and inhomogeneity on different fluids by varying
Prandtl number ($Pr$) is also studied. Depending on the value of parameters,
the unimodal (porous mode or fluid mode), bimodal (porous mode and fluid mode)
and also trimodal (porous mode, fluid mode and porous mode) nature of the
neutral curve is obtained. The increasing value of the inhomogeneity parameter,
depth ratio or decreasing value of the anisotropy parameter, Reynolds number,
Prandtl number and Darcy number raises the system instability. For

always observed for $\hat{d}<0.07$, and fluid mode for $\hat{d}>0.21$

QoE. And the decoupling of network and video layer further exacerbates the user
experience due to network-codec incoordination. This work therefore proposes
the Palette, a reinforcement learning based ABR scheme that unifies the
processing of network and video application layers to directly maximize the QoE
formulated as the weighted function of video quality, stalling rate and delay.
To this aim, a cross-layer optimization is proposed to derive fine-grained
compression factor of upcoming frame(s) using cross-layer observations like
network conditions, video encoding parameters, and video content complexity. As
a result, Palette manages to resolve the network-codec incoordination and to
best catch up with the network fluctuation. Compared with state-of-the-art
schemes in real-world tests, Palette not only reduces 3.1\%-46.3\% of the
stalling rate, 20.2\%-50.8\% of the delay, but also improves 0.2\%-7.2\% of the
video quality with comparable bandwidth consumption, under a variety of
application scenarios.

paradigm faces two limitations: 1) the human-generated items in the corpus
might fail to satisfy the users' diverse information needs, and 2) users
usually adjust the recommendations via passive and inefficient feedback such as
clicks. Nowadays, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has revealed significant success
across various domains, offering the potential to overcome these limitations:
1) generative AI can produce personalized items to meet users' specific
information needs, and 2) the newly emerged ChatGPT significantly facilitates
users to express information needs more precisely via natural language
instructions. In this light, the boom of AIGC points the way towards the
next-generation recommender paradigm with two new objectives: 1) generating
personalized content through generative AI, and 2) integrating user
instructions to guide content generation.
  To this end, we propose a novel Generative Recommender paradigm named
GeneRec, which adopts an AI generator to personalize content generation and
leverages user instructions to acquire users' information needs. Specifically,
we pre-process users' instructions and traditional feedback (e.g., clicks) via
an instructor to output the generation guidance. Given the guidance, we
instantiate the AI generator through an AI editor and an AI creator to
repurpose existing items and create new items, respectively. Eventually,
GeneRec can perform content retrieval, repurposing, and creation to meet users'
information needs. Besides, to ensure the trustworthiness of the generated
items, we emphasize various fidelity checks such as authenticity and legality
checks. Lastly, we study the feasibility of implementing the AI editor and AI
creator on micro-video generation, showing promising results.

encoding method. Given the domain-dependent nature of QD, additional evidence
from other domains is necessary. This study compares the impact of several
representations, including direct encoding, a dictionary-based representation,
parametric encoding, compositional pattern producing networks, and cellular
automata, on the generation of voxelized meshes in an architecture setting. The
results reveal that some indirect encodings outperform direct encodings and can
generate more diverse solution sets, especially when considering full
phenotypic diversity. The paper introduces a multi-encoding QD approach that
incorporates all evaluated representations in the same archive. Species of
encodings compete on the basis of phenotypic features, leading to an approach
that demonstrates similar performance to the best single-encoding QD approach.
This is noteworthy, as it does not always require the contribution of the

sharp signals that originate from the flux excitations and Majorana bound
states. Signatures of different flux excitations can be clearly observed in
this spectrum, such that one can observe evidences of flux states with

Moreover, in the Abelian phase we perceive that the spectrum in the frequency
domain is composed of streak signals. These signals, as in the nonlinear
response of the pure Kitaev model, represent a distinct signature of itinerant
Majorana fermions. However, deep in the Abelian phase whenever a Kitaev
exchange coupling is much stronger than the others, the streak signals are
weakened and only single sharp spots are seen in the response, which resembles

health monitoring and diagnosis. However, in a noisy environment such as a
factory, machine sound is always mixed up with environmental noises, and
noise-only periods can exist when a machine is not in operation. Therefore, a
deep neural network (DNN)-based fault classifier has to be able to distinguish
noise from machine sound and be robust to mixed noises. To deal with these
problems, we investigate on-site noise exposure (ONE) that exposes a DNN model
to the noises recorded in the same environment where the machine operates. Like
the outlier exposure technique, noise exposure trains a DNN classifier to
produce a uniform predicted probability distribution against noise-only data.
During inference, the DNN classifier trained by ONE outputs the maximum softmax
probability as the noise score and determines the noise-only period. We mix
machine sound and noises of the ToyADMOS2 dataset to simulate highly noisy
data. A ResNet-based classifier trained by ONE is evaluated and compared with
those trained by other out-of-distribution detection techniques. The test
results show that exposing a model to on-site noises can make a model more
robust than using other noises or detection techniques.

phases rely heavily on a principle known as bulk-boundary correspondence, which
predicts the emergence of protected boundary-localized energy excitations
(boundary states) if the bulk is topologically non-trivial. Current theoretical
approaches formulate a bulk-boundary correspondence as an equality between a
bulk and a boundary topological invariant, where the latter is a property of
boundary states. However, such an equality does not offer insight about the
stability or the sensitivity of the boundary states to external perturbations.
To solve this problem, we adopt a technique known as the Wiener-Hopf
factorization of matrix functions. Using this technique, we first provide an
elementary proof of the equality of the bulk and the boundary invariants for
one-dimensional systems with arbitrary boundary conditions in all
Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes. This equality also applies to
quasi-one-dimensional systems (e.g., junctions) formed by bulks belonging to
the same symmetry class. We then show that only topologically non-trivial
Hamiltonians can host stable zero-energy edge modes, where stability refers to
continuous deformation of zero-energy excitations with external perturbations
that preserve the symmetries of the class. By leveraging the Wiener-Hopf
factorization, we establish bounds on the sensitivity of such stable
zero-energy modes to external perturbations. Our results show that the
Wiener-Hopf factorization is a natural tool to investigate bulk-boundary
correspondence in quasi-one-dimensional fermionic symmetry-protected
topological phases. Our results on the stability and sensitivity of zero modes
are especially valuable for applications, including Majorana-based topological
quantum computing.

data for 3D vision tasks. The key requirements of the generative models are
that the generated data should be photorealistic to match the real-world
scenarios, and the corresponding 3D attributes should be aligned with given
sampling labels. However, we find that the recent NeRF-based 3D GANs hardly
meet the above requirements due to their designed generation pipeline and the
lack of explicit 3D supervision. In this work, we propose Lift3D, an inverted
2D-to-3D generation framework to achieve the data generation objectives. Lift3D
has several merits compared to prior methods: (1) Unlike previous 3D GANs that
the output resolution is fixed after training, Lift3D can generalize to any
camera intrinsic with higher resolution and photorealistic output. (2) By
lifting well-disentangled 2D GAN to 3D object NeRF, Lift3D provides explicit 3D
information of generated objects, thus offering accurate 3D annotations for
downstream tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework by augmenting

  Brightest Cluster Galaxy assembly","40 pages, 20 figures, 10 tables. Submitted to ApJS",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the roles of major and minor mergers during Brightest Cluster
Galaxy (BCG) assembly using surface brightness profiles, line indices, and
fundamental plane relations. Based on our own sample (Kluge et al.) and
consistently reanalyzed SDSS data, we find that BCGs and luminous normal
Ellipticals (LNEs) have similar central velocity dispersions, central
absorption line strengths, and central surface brightnesses. However, BCGs are
more luminous due to their much larger radial extent. These properties result
in a flattening of the Faber-Jackson and Mg$_{\rm b}$-luminosity relations
above 10$^{10.6}$ L$_{\odot,g'}$. We use this effect to estimate an amount of
60-80% of accreted and merged light in BCGs relative to LNEs, which agrees with
results from cosmological simulations. We determine the contribution of this
excess light (EL) at each radius from the difference between the surface flux
profiles of BCGs and LNEs. It is small in the center but increases steeply to
50% at already $\sim$3 kpc radius. The shape of these profiles suggests that
BCGs could be formed from LNEs in 3 major merger processes. This is also
consistent with the mild increase of the S\'ersic indices from $n\approx4$ to
$n\approx6$, as confirmed in merger simulations. We note that minor mergers
cannot be the dominant origin of the BCG's EL because they deposit too few
stars at intermediate radii $r\lesssim20$ kpc. The shape of the EL profile also
explains a detected offset of 0.14 dex of the fundamental planes for BCGs and
LNEs relative to each other.

differences in the total energy and charge density of several representative

different cutoffs of the new KEDFs, we find that the cutoff plays a crucial
role in determining the properties of metallic Al and semiconductor Si systems.
We conclude that the new KEDF with a sufficiently long cutoff performs even
better than some representative non-local KEDFs in some aspects, which sheds

ESE methods are retrieval-based frameworks that need to extract the contextual
features of entities and calculate the similarity between seed entities and
candidate entities. To achieve the two purposes, they should iteratively
traverse the corpus and the entity vocabulary provided in the datasets,
resulting in poor efficiency and scalability. The experimental results indicate
that the time consumed by the retrieval-based ESE methods increases linearly

generative ESE framework, Generative Entity Set Expansion (GenExpan), which
utilizes a generative pre-trained language model to accomplish ESE task.
Specifically, a prefix tree is employed to guarantee the validity of entity
generation, and automatically generated class names are adopted to guide the
model to generate target entities. Moreover, we propose Knowledge Calibration
and Generative Ranking to further bridge the gap between generic knowledge of
the language model and the goal of ESE task. Experiments on publicly available

expansion time consumed by GenExpan is independent of entity vocabulary and

mixing operations. The two research paths have been independently established
in the community. In this paper, we develop a novel perspective by unifying
Mixers and GCNs. We show that a mixer layer can be seen as a graph
convolutional layer applied to a fully-connected graph with parameterized
adjacency. Extending this theoretical finding to the practical side, we propose
Meta-Mixing Network (M$^2$-Net). Assisted with a novel zero aggregation
operation, our network is capable of capturing both the structure-agnostic and
the structure-sensitive dependencies in a collaborative manner. Not only is it
computationally efficient, but most importantly, it also achieves

  Dryers: A Review","25 Pages",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Tumble dryers offer a fast and convenient way of drying textiles independent
of weather conditions and therefore are frequently used in ordinary households.
However, artificial drying of textiles consumes considerable amounts of energy,
approximately 8.2 percent of the residential electricity consumption is for
drying of textiles in northern European countries (Cranston et al., 2019).
Several authors have investigated the aspects of the clothes drying cycle with
experimental and numerical methods to understand and improve the process. The
first turning point study on understanding the physics of evaporation for
tumble dryers was presented by Lambert et al. (1991) in the early 90s. With the
aid of Chilton_Colburn analogy, they introduced the concept of area-mass
transfer coefficient to address evaporation rate. Afterwards, several
experimental or numerical studies were published based on this concept, and
furthermore, the model was then developed into 0-dimensional (Deans, 2001) and
1-dimensional (Wei et al., 2017) to gain more accuracy. The evaporation rate is
considered to be the main system parameter for dryers with which other
performance parameters including drying time, effectiveness, moisture content
and efficiency can be estimated.
  More recent literature focused on utilizing dimensional analysis or image
processing techniques to correlate drying indices with system parameters.
However, the validity of these regressed models is machine-specific, and hence,
cannot be generalized yet. All the previous models for estimating the
evaporation rate in tumble dryers are discussed. The review of the related
literature showed that all of the previous models for the prediction of the
evaporation rate in the clothes dryers have some limitations in terms of
accuracy and applicability.

clusters are formed in-situ. Therefore, different parameters, including orbits,
of the globular clusters is a valuable tool for studying the Milky Way
evolution. However, since the evolution of the 3D mass distribution of the MW
is poorly constrained, the orbits of the clusters are usually calculated in
static potentials.
  Aims. In this work, we study the evolution of the GCs in several external
potentials, where we aim to quantify the effects of the evolving galaxy
potential on the orbits of the GCs. Methods. For the orbits calculation we used
five MW-like potentials from IllustrisTNG-100 simulation. The orbits of 159 GCs
were integrated using a high-order N-body parallel dynamic code phi-GPU, with
initial conditions obtained from recent Gaia DR3 catalogues.
  Results. We provide a classification of the GCs orbits according to their 3D
shapes and association with different components of the MW (disk, halo, bulge).
We also found that the globular clusters in the external potentials have
roughly similar energy-angular momentum distributions at the present time.
However, both total energy and total angular momentum of the GCs are not
conserved due to time-varying nature of the potentials. In some extreme cases,
the total energy can change up to 40% (18 objects) over the last 5 Gyr of
evolution. We found that the in-situ formed GCs are less affected by the
evolution of the TNG potentials as compared to the clusters which are likely
formed ex-situ. Therefore, our results suggest that time-varying potentials
significantly affect the orbits of the GC, thus making it vital for
understanding the formation of the MW.

recognition faces the problem of extracting discriminative and robust target
features from a small dataset. Deep learning has shown impressive performance
on the MSTAR dataset. However, data bias in a small dataset, such as background
correlation, impairs the causality of these methods, i.e., discriminative
features contain target and background differences. Moreover, different
operating conditions of SAR lead to target signatures and background clutter
variations in imaging results. However, many deep learning-based methods only
verify robustness to target or background variations in the current
experimental setting. In this paper, we propose a novel domain alignment
framework named Hierarchical Disentanglement-Alignment Network (HDANet) to
enhance features' causality and robustness. Concisely, HDANet consists of three
parts: The first part uses data augmentation to generate signature variations
for domain alignment. The second part disentangles the target features through
a multitask-assisted mask to prevent non-causal clutter from interfering with
subsequent alignment and recognition. Thirdly, a contrastive loss is employed
for domain alignment to extract robust target features, and the SimSiam
structure is applied to mitigate conflicts between contrastive loss and feature
discrimination. Finally, the proposed method shows high robustness across
MSTAR's multiple target, sensor, and environment variants. Noteworthy, we add a
new scene variant to verify the robustness to target and background variations.
Moreover, the saliency map and Shapley value qualitatively and quantitatively
demonstrate causality. Our code is available in

However, this issue has not yet been properly addressed in the previous

protocol for recognising the leading type of interlayer bonds in a system that
includes comparison of interlayer distances, binding energies and

To enable a fair comparison, filter parameters are auto-tuned with Bayesian

emergence of common and statistics-dependent features is traced in a unified

oscillation frequency on the trapping transversal to the vortical line. The
study reveals also the crucial role played by the nonlinear character of the
dynamics in the observed oscillation: for the considered experimental
conditions, the frequency, and, in turn, the effective inertial mass of the
vortex, are found to significantly depend on the amplitude of the generated
motion. It is also uncovered how the coupling with collective modes of the
fluid induces a non-negligible shift in the oscillation frequency. The

such type of perception data are evidential occupancy grid maps (OGMs). The
computation of a digital twin involves their spatiotemporal alignment and
fusion. In this work, we focus on the spatial alignment, also known as

83$\%$, respectively. The detection of main products, tolunitriles, can serve
as proxies for the undetected toluene in the ISM due to their much larger

is extremely intense under the warmer and denser PANH forming region of Titan's
stratosphere. The computational results show that the fractions of

Then, benzonitrile and tolunitriles may contribute to the formation of PANHs by
consecutive $\rm C_{2}H$ additions. Kinetic information of aromatic nitriles

capturing the long-time dependencies within an audio signal, thereby leading to
potential performance degradation in audio captioning. This letter presents a
novel method using graph attention (GraphAC) for encoder-decoder based audio
captioning. In the encoder, a graph attention module is introduced after the
PANNs to learn contextual association (i.e. the dependency among the audio
features over different time frames) through an adjacency graph, and a top-k
mask is used to mitigate the interference from noisy nodes. The learnt
contextual association leads to a more effective feature representation with
feature node aggregation. As a result, the decoder can predict important

contextual associations learned from the audio signal. Experimental results
show that GraphAC outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with PANNs as the

the audio representation of each audio sample by using the contrast between the

might be biased by the augmented data, due to the lack of physical properties
of machine sound, thereby limiting the detection performance. This paper uses
contrastive learning to refine audio representations for each machine ID,
rather than for each audio sample. The proposed two-stage method uses
contrastive learning to pretrain the audio representation model by
incorporating machine ID and a self-supervised ID classifier to fine-tune the
learnt model, while enhancing the relation between audio features from the same
ID. Experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods

practical applications, enhancing industrial productivity and facilitating
social development. With the increasing demands on computational capacity,
though numerous studies have explored the efficient training, a comprehensive
summarization on acceleration techniques of training deep learning models is
still much anticipated. In this survey, we present a detailed review for
training acceleration. We consider the fundamental update formulation and split
its basic components into five main perspectives: (1) data-centric: including
dataset regularization, data sampling, and data-centric curriculum learning
techniques, which can significantly reduce the computational complexity of the
data samples; (2) model-centric, including acceleration of basic modules,
compression training, model initialization and model-centric curriculum
learning techniques, which focus on accelerating the training via reducing the
calculations on parameters; (3) optimization-centric, including the selection
of learning rate, the employment of large batchsize, the designs of efficient
objectives, and model average techniques, which pay attention to the training
policy and improving the generality for the large-scale models; (4) budgeted
training, including some distinctive acceleration methods on source-constrained
situations; (5) system-centric, including some efficient open-source
distributed libraries/systems which provide adequate hardware support for the
implementation of acceleration algorithms. By presenting this comprehensive
taxonomy, our survey presents a comprehensive review to understand the general
mechanisms within each component and their joint interaction.

evaporation-induced hydrovoltaic effect received great attention since its
discovery in 2017 due to its negative heat emission property. Nevertheless, the
influence of electrode reactions in evaporation-induced power generation is not
negligible due to the chemical reaction between active metal electrodes and
water, which leads to "" exceptional "" power generation. Herein, we designed a
series of experiments based on air-laid paper devices with electrodes of
different activities as the top and bottom electrodes. To verify the
contribution of electrodes, we compared the output performance of different
electrode combinations when the device is partially-wetted and fully-wetted.
The device hydrophilicity, salt concentration, and acidity or basicity of
solutions are also comprehensively investigated. It is demonstrated that the
chemical reaction of active metals (Zn, Cu, Ag, etc.) with different aqueous
solutions can generate considerable electrical energy and significantly distort
the device performance, especially for Zn electrodes with an output voltage
from ~1.26 to ~1.52 V and current from ~1.24 to ~75.69 {\mu}A. To promote the

navigation, but they often struggle in crowded environments due to the Frozen
Robot Problem (FRP). Deep reinforcement learning-based methods address the FRP

overcome these challenges, we propose a method that uses Collision Probability
(CP) to help the robot navigate safely through crowds. The inclusion of CP in
the observation space gives the robot a sense of the level of danger of the
moving crowd. The robot will navigate through the crowd when it appears safe
but will take a detour when the crowd is moving aggressively. By focusing on
the most dangerous obstacle, the robot will not be confused when the crowd
density is high, ensuring scalability of the model. Our approach was developed
using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and trained using the Gazebo simulator
in a non cooperative crowd environment with obstacles moving at randomized
speeds and directions. We then evaluated our model on four different
crowd-behavior scenarios with varying densities of crowds. The results shown
that our method achieved a 100% success rate in all test settings. We compared
our approach with a current state-of-the-art DRLbased approach, and our
approach has performed significantly better. Importantly, our method is highly
generalizable and requires no fine-tuning after being trained once. We further

that this detector has a very good 2-D imaging performance for the thermal,

method, which exhibits superior generalisation performance, and apply it to
point cloud data (three-dimensional images composed of points). Point clouds
naturally contain permutation symmetry with respect to the ordering of their
points, making them a natural candidate for this technique. Our method captures
this symmetry in a quantum encoding that contains an equal quantum
superposition of all permutations and is therefore invariant under point order
permutation. We test this encoding method in numerical simulations using a
Quantum Support Vector Machine to classify point clouds drawn from either
spherical or toroidal geometries. We show that a permutation invariant encoding
improves in accuracy as the number of points contained in the point cloud
increases, while non-invariant quantum encodings decrease in accuracy. This
demonstrates that by implementing permutation invariance into the encoding, the

to weak and strong nonlinear coupling respectively. By analysing the weak
coupling case with ordinary perturbation theory and the strong coupling case
with a self-consistent methodology known as the self-consistent expansion,
precise analytic predictions for the static and dynamic structure factors are
obtained. The maximum frequency $n_{\max}$ supported by the system plays a role
in determining which of three possible classes such sheets belong to: (1) when
$g\gg1$, the system is mostly linear with roughness exponent $\zeta=1$ and
dynamic exponent $z=4$, (2) when $g\ll2/n_{\max}$, the system is extremely
nonlinear with roughness exponent $\zeta=1/2$ and dynamic exponent $z=3$, (3)
between these regimes, an intermediate behaviour is obtained in which a
crossover occurs such that the nonlinear behaviour is observed for small
frequencies while the linear behaviour is observed for large frequencies. The
large frequency linear tail is found to have a significant impact on the small
frequency behaviour of the sheet. Back-of-the-envelope calculations suggest
that ultra-thin materials such as graphene lie in this intermediate regime.
Despite the existence of these three distinct behaviours, the decay rate of the
dynamic structure factor is related to the static structure factor as if the
system were completely linear. This quasi-linearity occurs regardless of the
size of $g$ and at all length scales. Numerical simulations confirm the
existence of the three classes of behaviour and the quasi-linearity of all

previously associated with velocity signatures detected in lower velocity

also powerful tracers of planet-forming sites as they are sensitive to
turbulent motions triggered by planet-disc interactions. In MWC 480, we
identified non-axisymmetric line width enhancements around the radial
separation of candidate planet-driven buoyancy spirals, which we used to narrow
the location of the possible planet to an orbital radius of $R=245$ au and

conventional convolution operations do not provide the geometric invariance
required for the descriptor. To address this issue, we propose the Sparse
Deformable Descriptor Head (SDDH), which learns the deformable positions of
supporting features for each keypoint and constructs deformable descriptors.
Furthermore, SDDH extracts descriptors at sparse keypoints instead of a dense
descriptor map, which enables efficient extraction of descriptors with strong
expressiveness. In addition, we relax the neural reprojection error (NRE) loss
from dense to sparse to train the extracted sparse descriptors. Experimental
results show that the proposed network is both efficient and powerful in
various visual measurement tasks, including image matching, 3D reconstruction,

M$^\prime$ (MX$_2$/M$^\prime$), exhibit one-dimensional (1D) bands. These 1D
bands, occurring in the fundamental gap of the pristine material, are
dispersive along the doped chain but are strongly confined along the lateral
direction. This confinement occurs as the bare potential of the dopant chain
formed by the positively charged M$^\prime$ ions resembles the potential well
of a uniformly charged wire. These bands could show novel 1D physics, including
a new type of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior, multi-orbital Mott insulator
physics, and an unusual optical absorption, due to the simultaneous presence of
the spin-orbit coupling, strong correlation, multiple orbitals, Rashba spin
splitting, and broken symmetry. For the half-filled 1D bands, we find, quite
surprisingly, a broadening of the 1D bands due to correlation, as opposed to
the expected band narrowing. This is interpreted to be due to multiple orbitals
forming the single Hubbard band at different points of the Brillouin zone.
Furthermore, due to the presence of an intrinsic electric field along the
lateral direction, the 1D bands are Rashba spin-split and provide a new
mechanism for tuning the valley dependent optical transitions.

disorder in a generic model describing a dense sheet of active polar disks with
non-isotropic rotational and translational dynamics. In this state, randomly
oriented self-propelled disks become jammed, only displaying small fluctuations
about their mean positions and headings. The quenched disorder phase appears at
intermediate noise levels, between the two states that typically define the
flocking transition (a standard disordered state that displays continuously
changing headings due to rotational diffusion and a polar order state of
collective motion). We find that the angular fluctuations in this dense system
follow an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process leading to retrograde forces that oppose
self-propulsion, and determine its properties. Using this result, we explain
the mechanism behind the emergence of the quenched state and compute
analytically its critical noise, showing that it matches our numerical
simulations. We argue that this novel type of state could be observed in a
broad range of natural and artificial dense active systems with repulsive
interactions.

regions of the solar corona. This allows them to be used as means of diagnosing
plasma parameters and processes occurring in it. Plasma diagnostics, in turn,
requires a sufficiently reliable MHD model to describe the wave evolution. In
our paper, we focus on obtaining the exact analytical solution to the problem
of the linear evolution of standing slow magnetoacoustic (MA) waves in coronal
loops. Our consideration of the properties of slow waves is conducted using the
infinite magnetic field assumption. The main contribution to the wave dynamics
in this assumption comes from such processes as thermal conduction, unspecified
coronal heating, and optically thin radiation cooling. In our consideration,
the wave periods are assumed to be short enough so that the thermal misbalance
has a weak effect on them. Thus, the main non-adiabatic process affecting the
wave dynamics remains thermal conduction. The exact solution of the
evolutionary equation is obtained using the Fourier method. This means that it
is possible to trace the evolution of any harmonic of the initial perturbation,
regardless of whether it belongs to entropy or slow mode. We show that the
fraction of energy between entropy and slow mode is defined by the thermal
conduction and coronal loop parameters. It is shown for which parameters of
coronal loops it is reasonable to associate the full solution with a slow wave,
and when it is necessary to take into account the entropy wave. Furthermore, we
obtain the relationships for the phase shifts of various plasma parameters
applicable to any values of harmonic number and thermal condition coefficient.
In particular, it is shown that the phase shifts between density and
temperature perturbations for the second harmonic of the slow wave vary between
$\pi/2$ to 0, but are larger than for the fundamental harmonic.

state-of-the-art depth-based 3D single hand pose estimation method-to RGB
domain under interacting hand condition. Our key idea is to equip A2J with
strong local-global aware ability to well capture interacting hands' local fine
details and global articulated clues among joints jointly. To this end, A2J is
evolved under Transformer's non-local encoding-decoding framework to build
A2J-Transformer. It holds 3 main advantages over A2J. First, self-attention
across local anchor points is built to make them global spatial context aware
to better capture joints' articulation clues for resisting occlusion. Secondly,
each anchor point is regarded as learnable query with adaptive feature learning
for facilitating pattern fitting capacity, instead of having the same local
representation with the others. Last but not least, anchor point locates in 3D
space instead of 2D as in A2J, to leverage 3D pose prediction. Experiments on
challenging InterHand 2.6M demonstrate that, A2J-Transformer can achieve
state-of-the-art model-free performance (3.38mm MPJPE advancement in 2-hand

We show that knowledge of such relationships is critical to allocate optimally

have received significant attention in recent years. However, cyberattack
detection in smart grids now faces new challenges, including privacy
preservation and decentralized power zones with strategic data owners. To
address these technical bottlenecks, this paper proposes a novel Federated
Learning-based privacy-preserving and communication-efficient attack detection
framework, known as FedDiSC, that enables Discrimination between power System
disturbances and Cyberattacks. Specifically, we first propose a Federated
Learning approach to enable Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition subsystems
of decentralized power grid zones to collaboratively train an attack detection
model without sharing sensitive power related data. Secondly, we put forward a
representation learning-based Deep Auto-Encoder network to accurately detect
power system and cybersecurity anomalies. Lastly, to adapt our proposed
framework to the timeliness of real-world cyberattack detection in SGs, we
leverage the use of a gradient privacy-preserving quantization scheme known as
DP-SIGNSGD to improve its communication efficiency. Extensive simulations of
the proposed framework on publicly available Industrial Control Systems
datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve superior detection
accuracy while preserving the privacy of sensitive power grid related
information. Furthermore, we find that the gradient quantization scheme
utilized improves communication efficiency by 40% when compared to a
traditional federated learning approach without gradient quantization which
suggests suitability in a real-world scenario.

spectrum of applications in statistical learning and data science. However,
this problem is generally challenging to solve due to its non-convex and

following restrictions: (i) they are full gradient methods that require high
computational costs in each iteration; (ii) they are not capable of solving
general nonsmooth composite problems; (iii) they are infeasible methods and can
only achieve the feasibility of the solution at the limit point; (iv) they lack
rigorous convergence guarantees; (v) they only obtain weak optimality of
critical points. In this paper, we propose \textit{\textbf{OBCD}}, a new Block
Coordinate Descent method for solving general nonsmooth composite problems
under Orthogonality constraints. \textit{\textbf{OBCD}} is a feasible method
with low computation complexity footprints. In each iteration, our algorithm
updates $k$ rows of the solution matrix ($k\geq2$ is a parameter) to preserve
the constraints. Then, it solves a small-sized nonsmooth composite optimization
problem under orthogonality constraints either exactly or approximately. We
demonstrate that any exact block-$k$ stationary point is always an approximate
block-$k$ stationary point, which is equivalent to the critical stationary
point. We are particularly interested in the case where $k=2$ as the resulting
subproblem reduces to a one-dimensional nonconvex problem. We propose a
breakpoint searching method and a fifth-order iterative method to solve this
problem efficiently and effectively. We also propose two novel greedy
strategies to find a good working set to further accelerate the convergence of
\textit{\textbf{OBCD}}. Finally, we have conducted extensive experiments on

easy-to-handle, it has been applied in autonomous driving to provide the
surrounding information to downstream tasks. Inferring BEV semantic
segmentation conditioned on multi-camera-view images is a popular scheme in the
community as cheap devices and real-time processing. The recent work
implemented this task by learning the content and position relationship via the
vision Transformer (ViT). However, the quadratic complexity of ViT confines the
relationship learning only in the latent layer, leaving the scale gap to impede
the representation of fine-grained objects. And their plain fusion method of
multi-view features does not conform to the information absorption intention in
representing BEV features. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel
cross-scale hierarchical Transformer with correspondence-augmented attention
for semantic segmentation inferring. Specifically, we devise a hierarchical
framework to refine the BEV feature representation, where the last size is only
half of the final segmentation. To save the computation increase caused by this
hierarchical framework, we exploit the cross-scale Transformer to learn feature
relationships in a reversed-aligning way, and leverage the residual connection
of BEV features to facilitate information transmission between scales. We
propose correspondence-augmented attention to distinguish conducive and
inconducive correspondences. It is implemented in a simple yet effective way,
amplifying attention scores before the Softmax operation, so that the
position-view-related and the position-view-disrelated attention scores are
highlighted and suppressed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
has state-of-the-art performance in inferring BEV semantic segmentation
conditioned on multi-camera-view images.

  Aggregative Hierarchical Stochastic Games",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a class of $N$-player nonsmooth aggregative games over networks
in stochastic regimes, where the $i$th player is characterized by a composite
cost function $f_i+d_i+r_i$, $f_i$ is a smooth expectation-valued function
dependent on its own strategy and an aggregate function of rival strategies,
$d_i$ is a convex hierarchical term dependent on its strategy, and $r_i$ is a
nonsmooth convex function of its strategy with an efficient prox-evaluation. We
design a fully distributed iterative proximal stochastic gradient method
overlaid by a Tikhonov regularization, where each player may independently
choose its steplengths and regularization parameters while meeting some
coordination requirements. Under a monotonicity assumption on the concatenated
player-specific gradient mapping, we prove that the generated sequence
converges almost surely to the least-norm Nash equilibrium. In addition, we
establish the convergence rate associated with the expected gap function at the
time-averaged sequence. Furthermore, we consider the extension to the private
hierarchical regime where each player is a leader with respect to a collection
of private followers competing in a strongly monotone game, parametrized by
leader decisions. By leveraging a convolution-smoothing framework, we present
amongst the first fully distributed schemes for computing a Nash equilibrium of
a game complicated by such a hierarchical structure. Based on this framework,
we extend the rate statements to accommodate the computation of a hierarchical
stochastic Nash equilibrium by using a Fitzpatrick gap function. Notably, both
sets of fully distributed schemes display near-optimal sample-complexities,
suggesting that this hierarchical structure does not lead to performance
degradation. Finally, we validate the proposed methods on a networked
Nash-Cournot equilibrium problem and a hierarchical generalization.

polyelectrolyte brushes, we report findings that reveal, with increasing
relative humidity, a trend of frictional shear forces decaying over two orders

absorption, structure, and swelling of the brushes followed continuous trends
with increasing humidity. In contrast, a humidity-induced glass transition

near the annular gap at ~1.7 (200 au) within which a candidate circumplanetary
disk-hosting planet has been reported previously. In $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO,
we find a coherent upward flow arising from the gap. The upward gas flow is as
fast as $150~{\rm m~s}^{-1}$ in the regions traced by $^{12}$CO emission, which
corresponds to about 50% of the local sound speed or $6\%$ of the local
Keplerian speed. Such an upward gas flow is difficult to reconcile with an
embedded planet alone. Instead, we propose that magnetically driven winds via
ambipolar diffusion are triggered by the low gas density within the
planet-carved gap, dominating the kinematics of the gap region. We estimate the
ambipolar Elsasser number, Am, using the HCO$^+$ column density as a proxy for
ion density and find that Am is ~0.1 at the radial location of the upward flow.
This value is broadly consistent with the value at which numerical simulations
find ambipolar diffusion drives strong winds. We hypothesize the activation of
magnetically-driven winds in a planet-carved gap can control the growth of the
embedded planet. We provide a scaling relationship which describes the
wind-regulated terminal mass: adopting parameters relevant to 100 au from a
solar-mass star, we find the wind-regulated terminal mass is about one Jupiter
mass, which may help explain the dearth of directly imaged super-Jovian-mass

sources are highly stabilized, the pulse-to-pulse timing jitter is sufficiently
suppressed and data accumulation without any trigger signals is possible. To
effectively induce spin precession in ferromagnetic thin films, the spectral
bandwidth of the output of one of the EDF frequency comb sources is broadened
by a highly nonlinear fiber and then amplified at a wavelength of about 1030 nm
by a Yb-doped fiber amplifier. The output of the other frequency comb source is
converted to about 775 nm by second harmonic generation. We used this system to

bifurcation point, the system can tip from one attractor to another
(bifurcation-induced tipping). Typically, this stability exchange occurs at a
parameter value beyond the bifurcation value. This is what we call here the
stability exchange shift. We study systematically how the shift is affected by
the initial parameter value and its change rate. To that end, we present
numerical and analytical results for different types of bifurcations and
different paradigmatic systems. Finally, we deduce the scaling laws governing
this phenomenon. We show that increasing the change rate and starting the drift
further from the bifurcation can delay the tipping process. Furthermore, if the
change rate is sufficiently small, the shift becomes independent of the initial
condition (no memory) and the shift tends to zero as the square root of the
change rate. Thus, the bifurcation diagram for the system with fixed parameters
is recovered.

quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), remains a puzzle. Due to their periodicity and
association with active galactic nuclei (AGN), it is natural to relate these
eruptions to stars or compact objects in tight orbits around supermassive black
holes (SMBHs). In this paper, we predict the properties of emission from bow
shocks produced by stars crossing AGN disks, and compare them to the observed
properties of QPEs. We find that when a star's orbit is retrograde and has a
low inclination ($\lesssim 20^\circ$) with respect to the AGN disk, the
breakout emission from the bow shock can explain the observed duration ($\sim$
hours) and X-ray luminosity ($\sim$few$\times10^{42}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$) of
QPEs. This model can further explain various observed features of QPEs, such as
their complex luminosity evolution, the gradual decline of luminosity of the
flares over several years, the evolution of the hardness ratio, the modulation
of the luminosity during quiescent phases, and the preference of the central
SMBHs to have low masses.

partitioning layers, the algorithm can provide accuracy improvements for little

to the case of the disunity of high-energy physics. We give prominence to
supersymmetry, a concept that has given rise to several major but distinct
research programs in the field, such as the formulation of a consistent theory
of quantum gravity or the search for new particles. We show that ``theory'' and
`phenomenology'' in high-energy physics should be regarded as distinct
theoretical subcultures, between which supersymmetry has helped sustain
scientific ``trades''. However, as we demonstrate using a topic model, the
phenomenological component of supersymmetry research has lost traction and the
ability of supersymmetry to tie these subcultures together is now compromised.
Our work supports that even fields with an initially strong sentiment of unity

parameterized inequalities. However, enforcing these inequalities globally can
lead to very large parameters, resulting in overly conservative observer design
criteria. These criteria become infeasible for highly nonlinear applications,
such as networked epidemic processes. In this paper, we present an observer
design approach for estimating the state of nonlinear systems, without
requiring any parameterization of the system's nonlinearities. The proposed
observer design depends only on systems' matrices and applies to systems with
any nonlinearity. We establish different design criteria for ensuring both
asymptotic and exponential convergence of the estimation error to zero. To
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we employ it for estimating the state
of a networked SIR epidemic model. We show that, even in the presence of

research has focused on detecting them efficiently. Dynamic predictive analyses
work by observing concurrent executions, and reason about alternative
interleavings that can witness concurrency bugs. Such techniques offer
scalability and sound bug reports, and have emerged as an effective approach
for concurrency bug detection, such as data races. Effective dynamic deadlock
prediction, however, has proven a challenging task, as no deadlock predictor
currently meets the requirements of soundness, high-precision, and efficiency.
In this paper, we first formally establish that this tradeoff is unavoidable,
by showing that (a) sound and complete deadlock prediction is intractable, in
general, and (b) even the seemingly simpler task of determining the presence of
potential deadlocks, which often serve as unsound witnesses for actual
predictable deadlocks, is intractable. The main contribution of this work is a
new class of predictable deadlocks, called sync(hronization)-preserving
deadlocks. Informally, these are deadlocks that can be predicted by reordering
the observed execution while preserving the relative order of conflicting
critical sections. We present two algorithms for sound deadlock prediction
based on this notion. Our first algorithm SPDOffline detects all
sync-preserving deadlocks, with running time that is linear per abstract

generates gender-stereotypical words at the expense of predicting the correct

designing a feedback controller that captures realtime uncertainty while being
uncertainty-unaware, the presented approach demonstrates promises of obtaining
solutions that are close to the OPF ones without needing to solve the OPF. The
proposed controller responds in realtime to deviations in renewables generation
and loads, guaranteeing transient stability, while always yielding feasible
solutions of the ACOPF with no constraint violations. As the studied approach
herein indeed yields slightly more expensive realtime generator setpoints, the
corresponding price of realtime control and regulation is examined.
Cost-comparisons with the traditional ACOPF are also showcased -- all via case

Firstly, the thermodynamic model for mantle water storage capacity has been
reviewed. Then, based on the two case studies on Earth and Mars, how to
translate atomic-scale experimental data of water solubility and their
measurement errors into planetary-scale models of mantle water storage capacity
has been explored by using robust regression, Monte Carlo methods, and

exoplanet observational campaigns can help us understand the statistical
properties of the mantle water storage capacities of rocky exoplanets has been
introduced. Finally, the application limitations of data science methods in
mineral physics research have been discussed, and how to better combine

slowly rotating magnetized object can be active in the radio band. A canonical
magnetic field of $1.3\times10^{14}$ G estimated from the pulsar period and its
time derivative is wholly insufficient for PSR J0901-4046 to operate.
Consideration of a magnetic inclination angle of $10^\circ$ estimated from the
pulse width gives a higher magnetic field of $1.5\times10^{15}$ G, which is
still an order of magnitude lower than the necessary minimum of
$2.5\times10^{16}$ G following from the death line for radio pulsars with
magnetic fields exceeding the critical value $4.4\times10^{13}$ G. We show that
if the observed microstructure of single pulses reflects relativistic beaming,
the inferred surface magnetic field appears to be $3.2\times10^{16}$ G, and
without this assumption it is no less than $2.7\times10^{16}$ G, which explains
the existence of radio emission from PSR J0901-4046. This estimation makes PSR
J0901-4046 a radio pulsar with the strongest magnetic field known and is a sign
that PSR J0901-4046 slows down not by magnetic-dipole radiation, but rather by

We find that the ILX formation timescale is nearly an order of magnitude (~1

details on the nonlinear dynamics of such system. We demonstrate that providing
a time modulation to the inerter's base produces two additions on the dynamics

and ii) a time varying force term; both quantities are functions of the
modulating frequency. With specific choices of parameters, the
modulation-induced force term -- that represents one of the main drawbacks in
most experimental realizations of purely time-modulated systems -- vanishes and
we are left with an effective time-varying mass. We then illustrate that this
building block can be leveraged to realize non-reciprocal wave manipulation
devices, and concentrate on a non-reciprocal beam-like waveguide. The simple
design and the clean performance of our system makes it an attractive candidate

data with external validations, but to what extent should it generalize remains
unclear. In practice, prediction models are externally validated using data
from very different settings, including populations from other health systems
or countries, with predictably poor results. This may not be a fair reflection
of the performance of the model which was designed for a specific target
population or setting, and may be stretching the expected model
generalizability. To address this, we suggest to externally validate a model
using new data from the target population to ensure clear implications of
validation performance on model reliability, whereas model generalizability to
broader settings should be carefully investigated during model development
instead of explored post-hoc. Based on this perspective, we propose a roadmap
that facilitates the development and application of reliable, fair, and
trustworthy artificial intelligence prediction models.

automatic compression method is needed. However, the huge search space of the
automatic method introduces plenty of computing budgets that make the automatic
process challenging to be applied in real scenarios. In this paper, we propose
an end-to-end framework named AutoQNN, for automatically quantizing different
layers utilizing different schemes and bitwidths without any human labor.
AutoQNN can seek desirable quantizing schemes and mixed-precision policies for
mainstream DNN models efficiently by involving three techniques: quantizing
scheme search (QSS), quantizing precision learning (QPL), and quantized
architecture generation (QAG). QSS introduces five quantizing schemes and
defines three new schemes as a candidate set for scheme search, and then uses
the differentiable neural architecture search (DNAS) algorithm to seek the
layer- or model-desired scheme from the set. QPL is the first method to learn
mixed-precision policies by reparameterizing the bitwidths of quantizing
schemes, to the best of our knowledge. QPL optimizes both classification loss
and precision loss of DNNs efficiently and obtains the relatively optimal
mixed-precision model within limited model size and memory footprint. QAG is
designed to convert arbitrary architectures into corresponding quantized ones
without manual intervention, to facilitate end-to-end neural network
quantization. We have implemented AutoQNN and integrated it into Keras.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that AutoQNN can consistently outperform
state-of-the-art quantization.

novel and fully data-driven method for identifying and classifying response
regimes of a dynamical system without requiring human intervention. This
approach is a valuable tool for exploring and discovering response regimes in
complex dynamical systems, especially when the governing equations and the
number of response regimes are unknown, and the system is expensive to sample.
Additionally, the method is useful for order reduction, as it can be used to
identify the most dominant response regimes of a given dynamical system.
DR$^2$EI utilizes unsupervised learning algorithms to transform the system's
response into an embedding space that facilitates regime classification. An
active sequential sampling approach based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
is used to efficiently sample the parameter space, quantify uncertainty, and
provide optimal trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. The
performance of the DR$^2$EI method was evaluated by analyzing three established
dynamical systems: the mathematical pendulum, the Lorenz system, and the
Duffing oscillator. The method was shown to effectively identify a variety of

frequency content, demonstrating its versatility in capturing a wide range of
behaviors. While it may not be possible to guarantee that all possible regimes
will be identified, the method provides an automated and efficient means for

  Combustion Institute, At College Station, Texas)",,,,"physics.chem-ph cs.LG physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A combustion chemistry acceleration scheme is developed based on deep
operator networks (DeepONets). The scheme is based on the identification of
combustion reaction dynamics through a modified DeepOnet architecture such that
the solutions of thermochemical scalars are projected to new solutions in small
and flexible time increments. The approach is designed to efficiently implement
chemistry acceleration without the need for computationally expensive
integration of stiff chemistry. An additional framework of latent-space
dynamics identification with modified DeepOnet is also proposed which enhances
the computational efficiency and widens the applicability of the proposed
scheme. The scheme is demonstrated on simple chemical kinetics of hydrogen
oxidation to more complex chemical kinetics of n-dodecane high- and
low-temperature oxidations. The proposed framework accurately learns the
chemical kinetics and efficiently reproduces species and temperature temporal
profiles corresponding to each application. In addition, a very large speed-up
with a great extrapolation capability is also observed with the proposed
scheme.

  and Machine Learning","20 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.CV physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this study, a novel active solubility sensing device using computer vision
is proposed to improve separation purification performance and prevent
malfunctions of separation equipment such as preparative liquid
chromatographers and evaporators. The proposed device actively measures the
solubility by transmitting a solution using a background image. The proposed
system is a combination of a device that uses a background image and a method
for estimating the dissolution and particle presence by changing the background
image. The proposed device consists of four parts: camera, display, adjustment,
and server units. The camera unit is made up of a rear image sensor on a mobile
phone. The display unit is comprised of a tablet screen. The adjustment unit is
composed of rotating and height-adjustment jigs. Finally, the server unit
consists of a socket server for communication between the units and a PC,
including an automated solubility analysis system implemented in Python. The
dissolution status of the solution was divided into four categories and a case
study was conducted. The algorithms were trained based on these results. Six
organic materials and four organic solvents were combined with 202 tests to
train the developed algorithm. As a result, the evaluation rate for the
dissolution state exhibited an accuracy of 95 %. In addition, the device and
method must develop a feedback function that can add a solvent or solute after
dissolution detection using solubility results for use in autonomous systems,
such as a synthetic automation system. Finally, the diversification of the
sensing method is expected to extend not only to the solution but also to the
solubility and homogeneity analysis of the film.

  Storage Applications",,,,,"cs.ET physics.app-ph physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has emerged as a promising building block for
next-generation ultra-high density storage devices. Although DNA has high
durability and extremely high density in nature, its potential as the basis of
storage devices is currently hindered by limitations such as expensive and
complex fabrication processes and time-consuming read-write operations. In this
article, we propose the use of a DNA crossbar array architecture for an
electrically readable Read-Only Memory (DNA-ROM). While information can be
written error-free to a DNA-ROM array using appropriate sequence encoding, its
read accuracy can be affected by several factors such as array size,
interconnect resistance, and Fermi energy deviations from HOMO levels of DNA
strands employed in the crossbar. We study the impact of array size and
interconnect resistance on the bit error rate of a DNA-ROM array through
extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We have also analyzed the performance of our
proposed DNA crossbar array for an image storage application, as a function of
array size and interconnect resistance. While we expect that future advances in
bioengineering and materials science will address some of the fabrication
challenges associated with DNA crossbar arrays, we believe that the
comprehensive body of results we present in this paper establishes the
technical viability of DNA crossbar arrays as low-power, high-density storage
devices. Finally, our analysis of array performance vis-a-vis interconnect
resistance should provide valuable insights into aspects of the fabrication
process such as the proper choice of interconnects necessary for ensuring high
read accuracies.

can be hailed for one-way point-to-point trips. The total distance driven by
the vehicles and the fleet size can be reduced by employing ridesharing, i.e.,
by assigning multiple passengers to one vehicle. However, finding the optimal
passenger-vehicle assignment in an MoD system is a hard combinatorial problem.
In this work, we demonstrate how the VGA method, a recently proposed systematic
method for ridesharing, can be used to compute the optimal passenger-vehicle
assignments and corresponding vehicle routes in a massive-scale MoD system. In
contrast to existing works, we solve all passenger-vehicle assignment problems
to optimality, regularly dealing with instances containing thousands of
vehicles and passengers. Moreover, to examine the impact of using optimal
ridesharing assignments, we compare the performance of an MoD system that uses
optimal assignments against an MoD system that uses assignments computed using
insertion heuristic and against an MoD system that uses no ridesharing. We
found that the system that uses optimal ridesharing assignments subject to the
maximum travel delay of 4 minutes reduces the vehicle distance driven by 57 %
compared to an MoD system without ridesharing. Furthermore, we found that the
optimal assignments result in a 20 % reduction in vehicle distance driven and 5
% lower average passenger travel delay compared to a system that uses insertion
heuristic.

stoichiometric factors of chemical reactions. It can be done by hand, even for

independent interest. The discussion is elaborated for matrices with entries in
a principal ideal domain $R$. The ker pc calculates a basis with coefficients
in $R$ for the kernel of a matrix, seen as e $Q$-vector space, where $Q$ is the
quotient field of $R$. If $W$ is a free saturated $R$-submodule of $R^n$ I
address the question how to modify an $R$-basis of the $Q$-vector subspace
$Q\otimes _R W$ over the quotient field $Q$ to obtain a basis of the $R$-module
$W$. I also indicate how one can solve inhomogeneous linear systems, invert
matrices and determine the four subspaces using pivotal condensation. I
formulate the balancing by inspection method that is widely used to reduce the

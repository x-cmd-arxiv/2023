neural networks have contributed to groundbreaking improvements in computer
systems that process language, widely-used neural network architectures still
exhibit limitations in their ability to process syntax. To address this issue,
prior work has proposed adding stack data structures to neural networks,
drawing inspiration from theoretical connections between syntax and stacks.
However, these methods employ deterministic stacks that are designed to track
one parse at a time, whereas syntactic ambiguity, which requires a
nondeterministic stack to parse, is extremely common in language. In this
dissertation, we remedy this discrepancy by proposing a method of incorporating
nondeterministic stacks into neural networks. We develop a differentiable data
structure that efficiently simulates a nondeterministic pushdown automaton,
representing an exponential number of computations with a dynamic programming
algorithm. We incorporate this module into two predominant architectures:
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. We show that this raises
their formal recognition power to arbitrary context-free languages, and also
aids training, even on deterministic context-free languages. Empirically,
neural networks with nondeterministic stacks learn context-free languages much
more effectively than prior stack-augmented models, including a language with
theoretically maximal parsing difficulty. We also show that an RNN augmented
with a nondeterministic stack is capable of surprisingly powerful behavior,
such as learning cross-serial dependencies, a well-known non-context-free
pattern. We demonstrate improvements on natural language modeling and provide
analysis on a syntactic generalization benchmark. This work represents an
important step toward building systems that learn to use syntax in more
human-like fashion.

phenomena in confining gauge theories. The dynamics of this process has been
the subject of recent intensive studies, in which plenty of numerical results
suggest the following dichotomy: the confining string can decay relatively fast
or persist up to extremely long times. Here, we put forward a dynamical
localization transition as the mechanism underlying this dichotomy. To this
end, we derive an effective string breaking description in the light-meson
sector of a confined spin chain and show that the problem can be regarded as a
dynamical localization transition in Fock space. Fast and suppressed string
breaking dynamics are identified with delocalized and localized behavior,
respectively. We then provide a further reduction of the dynamical string
breaking problem onto a quantum impurity model, where the string is represented
as an ""impurity"" immersed in a meson bath. It is shown that this
phenomenological model features a localization-delocalization transition,
giving a general and simple physical basis to understand the qualitatively
distinct string breaking regimes. These findings are directly relevant for a
wider class of confining lattice models in one and higher dimensions and could
be realized on present-day Rydberg quantum simulators.

translation ambiguities, and in fact the document setting is the most natural
setting for nearly all translation. It is therefore unfortunate that machine
translation -- both research and production -- largely remains stuck in a
decades-old sentence-level translation paradigm. It is also an increasingly
glaring problem in light of competitive pressure from large language models,
which are natively document-based. Much work in document-context machine
translation exists, but for various reasons has been unable to catch hold. This
paper suggests a path out of this rut by addressing three impediments at once:
what architectures should we use? where do we get document-level information
for training them? and how do we know whether they are any good? In contrast to
work on specialized architectures, we show that the standard Transformer
architecture is sufficient, provided it has enough capacity. Next, we address
the training data issue by taking document samples from back-translated data
only, where the data is not only more readily available, but is also of higher
quality compared to parallel document data, which may contain machine
translation output. Finally, we propose generative variants of existing
contrastive metrics that are better able to discriminate among document
systems. Results in four large-data language pairs (DE$\rightarrow$EN,
EN$\rightarrow$DE, EN$\rightarrow$FR, and EN$\rightarrow$RU) establish the
success of these three pieces together in improving document-level performance.

quickly once the attackers stop model poisoning. In this paper, we investigate
the connection between the durability of FL backdoors and the relationships
between benign images and poisoned images (i.e., the images whose labels are
flipped to the target label during local training). Specifically, benign images
with the original and the target labels of the poisoned images are found to
have key effects on backdoor durability. Consequently, we propose a novel

selection based on movement data. Resource preferences and movement patterns,
however, can depend on the animal's unobserved behavioural states, such as
resting or foraging. This is ignored in standard (integrated) step-selection
analyses (SSA, iSSA). While different approaches have emerged to account for
such states in the analysis, the performance of such approaches and the
consequences of ignoring the states in the analysis have rarely been
quantified. We evaluated the recent idea of combining hidden Markov chains and
iSSA in a single modelling framework. The resulting Markov-switching integrated
step-selection analysis (MS-iSSA) allows for a joint estimation of both the
underlying behavioural states and the associated state-dependent habitat
selection. In an extensive simulation study, we compared the MS-iSSA to both
the standard iSSA and a classification-based iSSA (i.e., a two-step approach
based on a separate prior state classification). We further illustrate the
three approaches in a case study on fine-scale interactions of simultaneously
tracked bank voles (Myodes glareolus). The results indicate that standard iSSAs
can lead to erroneous conclusions due to both biased estimates and unreliable
p-values when ignoring underlying behavioural states. We found the same for
iSSAs based on prior state-classifications, as they ignore misclassifications
and classification uncertainties. The MS-iSSA, on the other hand, performed
well in parameter estimation and decoding of behavioural states. To facilitate
its use, we implemented the MS-iSSA approach in the R package msissa available

entanglement phase transition as the measurement rate is tuned. In this work,
we consider a different setting in which the projective measurements are

This can be seen as a one-dimensional unitary circuit game in which two players
get to place unitary gates on randomly assigned bonds at different rates: The
""entangler"" applies a random local unitary gate with the aim of generating
extensive (volume law) entanglement. The ""disentangler"", based on limited
knowledge about the state, chooses a unitary gate to reduce the entanglement
entropy on the assigned bond with the goal of limiting to only finite (area
law) entanglement. In order to elucidate the resulting entanglement dynamics,
we consider three different scenarios: (i) a classical discrete height model,
(ii) a Clifford circuit, and (iii) a general $U(4)$ unitary circuit. We find
that both the classical and Clifford circuit models exhibit phase transitions
as a function of the rate that the disentangler places a gate, which have
similar properties that can be understood through a connection to the
stochastic Fredkin chain. In contrast, the ``entangler'' always wins when using
Haar random unitary gates and we observe extensive, volume law entanglement for

with both a high quality factor and a small mode volume. Photonic crystal
cavities have been used to realize compact nano-lasers and achieve strong

to create chirped mirrors. Chirping has underpinned advances in ultra-fast
lasers based on bulk mirrors, but has yet to be fully exploited in integrated
photonics, where it could provide a means to engineer otherwise unattainable
dispersion profiles for a range of nonlinear optical applications, including
soliton frequency comb generation. The vast majority of integrated resonators

nitride. We employ chirped photonic crystal mirrors to provide anomalous

sublattices cancel, their state is notoriously difficult to read. One way to
overcome this is to couple AFMs to ferromagnets - whose state is trivially read
via magneto-resistance sensors. Here we present conditions, using theoretical
modelling, that it is possible to switch the magnetization of an AFM/FM bilayer
using THz frequency pulses with moderate field amplitude and short durations,
achievable in experiments. Consistent switching is observed in the phase
diagrams for an order of magnitude increase in the interface coupling and a
tripling in the thickness of the FM layer. We demonstrate a range of reversal
paths that arise due to the combination of precession in the materials and the
THz-induced fields. Our analysis demonstrates that the AFM drives the switching
and results in a much higher frequency dynamics in the FM due to the exchange
coupling at the interface. The switching is shown to be robust over a broad
range of temperatures relevant for device applications.

wavelengths. There may be asymmetry in the jet plasma parameters in opposite
jet lobes (e.g. electron density, temperature, and outflow velocity). $Aims.$
We examined the Th 28 jet in a 3""x3"" where the jet material is collimated and
accelerated. Our goal is to map the morphology and determine its physical
parameters to determine the physical origin of such asymmetries. $Methods.$ We
present $JHK$-spectra of Th 28 obtained with the SINFONI on the (VLT, ESO) in
June-July 2015. $Results.$ The [Fe II] emission originates in collimated jet
lobes. Two new axial knots are detected at 1"" in the blue lobe and 1"".2 in the
red lobe. The H$_2$ radiation is emitted from an extended region with a radius
of $\gtrsim270$ au, which is perpendicular to the jet. The PV diagrams of the
bright H$_2$ lines reveal faint H$_2$ emission along both jet lobes as well.
The compact and faint H I emission (Pa$\beta$ and Br$\gamma$) comes from two
regions, namely from a spherical region around the star and from the jet lobes.
The size of the jet launching region is derived as 0"".015 ($\sim$3 au at 185
pc), and the initial opening angle of the Th 28 jet is $\sim28^0$, which makes
this jet substantially less collimated than most jets from other CTTs.
$Conclusions.$ The emission in [Fe II], H$_2$, and H I lines suggests a
morphology in which the ionised gas in the disc appears to be disrupted by the
jet. The resolved disc-like H$_2$ emission most likely arises in the disc
atmosphere from shocks caused by a radial uncollimated wind. The asymmetry of
the [Fe II] photocentre shifts with respect to the jet source arises in the
immediate vicinity of the driving source of Th28 and suggests that the observed
brightness asymmetry is intrinsic as well.

major improvements for solving multi-commodity flows to high accuracy came from

commodity problem (e.g.~maximum flow) where all recent improvements also rely
on graph specific techniques such as graph decompositions or the Laplacian
paradigm (see e.g.~[CMSV17,KLS20,BLL+21,CKL+22]).
  This phenomenon sparked research to understand why these graph techniques are
unlikely to help for multi-commodity flow. [Kyng, Zhang'20] reduced solving
multi-commodity Laplacians to general linear systems and [Ding, Kyng, Zhang'22]
showed that general linear programs can be reduced to 2-commodity flow.
However, the reductions create sparse graph instances, so improvement to
multi-commodity flows on denser graphs might exist.
  We show that one can indeed speed up multi-commodity flow algorithms on
non-sparse graphs using graph techniques from single-commodity flow algorithms.
This is the first improvement to high accuracy multi-commodity flow algorithms
that does not just stem from improvements to general linear program solvers. In
particular, using graph data structures from recent min-cost flow algorithm by
[BLL+21] based on the celebrated expander decomposition framework, we show that

category we named SI semigroups (for automatic selfadjoint ideal semigroups).
Equivalent to the SI property is the solvability, for each A in the semigroup,
of the bilinear operator equation A^* = XAY which we believe is a new
connection relating the semigroup theory with the theory of operator equations.
We found in our earlier works in the subject that even at the basic level of
singly generated semigroups, the investigation of SI semigroups led to
interesting algebraic and analytic phenomena when generated by rank one
operators, normal operators, partial and power partial isometries,
subnormal-hyponormal-essentially normal operators, and weighted shift

equation A^* = XAY in a multiplicative semigroup of finite matrices. This
separate focus is needed because the techniques employed in our earlier works
we could not adapt to finite matrices. In this paper we find that for certain
classes of generators, being a partial isometry is equivalent to generating an
SI semigroup. Such classes are: degree 2 nilpotent matrices, weighted shifts,
and non-normal Jordan matrices. For the key tools used to establish these
equivalences, we developed a number of necessary conditions for singly

electron-beam-induced deposition of amorphous carbon. The contrast separation
method is further applied to an individual CNT, reducing its apparent diameter
from 36 nm to 6 nm. This result hints at the potential for LVSEM to count the
density exceeding 150 CNTs/um of CNT arrays. Finally, a comparative study of
LVSEM and transmission electron microscopy confirms the failure of LVSEM to
resolve CNTs in a bundle. The results suggest that the density of CNT arrays
may be underestimated in reported SEM data. The proposed method can serve as a
useful tool for further study and application of arrayed CNTs.

was developed, termed the ""Segment Anything Model"" (SAM). SAM can segment
objects in input imagery based upon cheap input prompts, such as one (or more)
points, a bounding box, or a mask. The authors examined the zero-shot image
segmentation accuracy of SAM on a large number of vision benchmark tasks and
found that SAM usually achieved recognition accuracy similar to, or sometimes
exceeding, vision models that had been trained on the target tasks. The
impressive generalization of SAM for segmentation has major implications for
vision researchers working on natural imagery. In this work, we examine whether
SAM's impressive performance extends to overhead imagery problems, and help
guide the community's response to its development. We examine SAM's performance
on a set of diverse and widely-studied benchmark tasks. We find that SAM does
often generalize well to overhead imagery, although it fails in some cases due
to the unique characteristics of overhead imagery and the target objects. We
report on these unique systematic failure cases for remote sensing imagery that
may comprise useful future research for the community. Note that this is a
working paper, and it will be updated as additional analysis and results are
completed.

generally fall short of human-level systematic generalization. It has been
argued that explicitly capturing the underlying structure of data should allow
connectionist systems to generalize in a more predictable and systematic
manner. Indeed, evidence in humans suggests that interpreting the world in
terms of symbol-like compositional entities may be crucial for intelligent
behavior and high-level reasoning. Another common limitation of deep learning
systems is that they require large amounts of training data, which can be
expensive to obtain. In representation learning, large datasets are leveraged
to learn generic data representations that may be useful for efficient learning
of arbitrary downstream tasks.
  This thesis is about structured representation learning. We study methods
that learn, with little or no supervision, representations of unstructured data
that capture its hidden structure. In the first part of the thesis, we focus on
representations that disentangle the explanatory factors of variation of the
data. We scale up disentangled representation learning to a novel robotic
dataset, and perform a systematic large-scale study on the role of pretrained
representations for out-of-distribution generalization in downstream robotic
tasks. The second part of this thesis focuses on object-centric
representations, which capture the compositional structure of the input in
terms of symbol-like entities, such as objects in visual scenes. Object-centric
learning methods learn to form meaningful entities from unstructured input,
enabling symbolic information processing on a connectionist substrate. In this
study, we train a selection of methods on several common datasets, and
investigate their usefulness for downstream tasks and their ability to
generalize out of distribution.

low-frequency driving pose to high-frequency dynamic human appearances, so an
effective pose encoding method that can encode high-fidelity human details is
essential to human avatar modeling. To this end, we present PoseVocab, a novel
pose encoding method that encourages the network to discover the optimal pose
embeddings for learning the dynamic human appearance. Given multi-view RGB
videos of a character, PoseVocab constructs key poses and latent embeddings
based on the training poses. To achieve pose generalization and temporal
consistency, we sample key rotations in $so(3)$ of each joint rather than the
global pose vectors, and assign a pose embedding to each sampled key rotation.
These joint-structured pose embeddings not only encode the dynamic appearances
under different key poses, but also factorize the global pose embedding into
joint-structured ones to better learn the appearance variation related to the
motion of each joint. To improve the representation ability of the pose
embedding while maintaining memory efficiency, we introduce feature lines, a
compact yet effective 3D representation, to model more fine-grained details of
human appearances. Furthermore, given a query pose and a spatial position, a
hierarchical query strategy is introduced to interpolate pose embeddings and
acquire the conditional pose feature for dynamic human synthesis. Overall,
PoseVocab effectively encodes the dynamic details of human appearance and
enables realistic and generalized animation under novel poses. Experiments show
that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines both qualitatively
and quantitatively in terms of synthesis quality. Code is available at

Self-supervised Transformers have shown outstanding performance in a variety of
structured tasks in NLP and computer vision. But multivariate time series data
contains structured relationships over two dimensions: time and recorded event
type, and straightforward applications of Transformers to time series data do
not leverage this distinct structure. The quadratic scaling of self-attention
layers can also significantly limit the input sequence length without
appropriate input engineering. We introduce the DuETT architecture, an
extension of Transformers designed to attend over both time and event type

aggregated input where sparse time series are transformed into a regular
sequence with fixed length; this lowers the computational complexity relative
to previous EHR Transformer models and, more importantly, enables the use of
larger and deeper neural networks. When trained with self-supervised prediction

setup (3700-7500{\AA}, 6{\AA}/FWHM) and the CALIFA observing strategy. It
includes galaxies of any morphological type, star-formation stage, a wide range
of stellar masses ($\sim$10$^7$ 10$^{12}$ Msun ), at an average redshift of
$\sim$0.015 (90\% within 0.005$<$z$<$0.05). Primarily selected based on the
projected size and apparent magnitude, we demonstrate that it can be volume
corrected resulting in a statistically limited but representative sample of the
population of galaxies in the nearby Universe. All the data were homogeneous
re-reduced, introducing a set of modifications to the previous reduction. The
most relevant is the development and implementation of a new
cube-reconstruction algorithm that provides with an (almost) seeing-limited
spatial resolution (FWHM PSF $\sim$1.0"").To illustrate the usability and
quality of the data, we extracted two aperture spectra for each galaxy (central
1.5"" and fully integrated), and analyze them using pyFIT3D. We obtain a set of
observational and physical properties of both the stellar populations and the
ionized gas, that have been compared for the two apertures, exploring their
distributions as a function of the stellar masses and morphologies of the
galaxies, comparing with recent results in the literature. DATA RELEASE:

daily lives, and they are often regarded as trustworthy sources of information.
However, there is a growing concern that the advancement of artificial

confusion and diminish trust in photographs. This study aims to answer the
question of whether the current state-of-the-art AI-based visual content
generation models can consistently deceive human eyes and convey false
information. By conducting a high-quality quantitative study with fifty
participants, we reveal, for the first time, that humans cannot distinguish
between real photos and AI-created fake photos to a significant degree 38.7%.
Our study also finds that an individual's background, such as their gender,
age, and experience with AI-generated content (AIGC), does not significantly
affect their ability to distinguish AI-generated images from real photographs.
However, we do observe that there tend to be certain defects in AI-generated
images that serve as cues for people to distinguish between real and fake
photos. We hope that our study can raise awareness of the potential risks of
AI-generated images and encourage further research to prevent the spread of
false information. From a positive perspective, AI-generated images have the
potential to revolutionize various industries and create a better future for
humanity if they are used and regulated properly.

  paths","13 pages, 6 figures, comments welcome",,,,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.stat-mech","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Polariton chemistry holds promise for facilitating mode-selective chemical
reactions, but the underlying mechanism behind the rate modifications observed
under vibrational strong coupling is not well understood. Using the recently
developed quantum transition path theory, we have uncovered a mechanism of
resonant suppression of a thermal reaction rate in a simple model polaritonic
system, consisting of a reactive mode in a bath confined to a lossless
microcavity with a single photon mode. This mechanism was uncovered by
resolving the quantum dynamical reactive pathways and identifying their rate
limiting transitions. Upon inspecting the wavefunctions associated with the
rate limiting transition, we observed the formation of a polariton and
identified the concomitant rate suppression as due to hybridization between the
reactive mode and the cavity mode, which inhibits bath-mediated tunneling
during the reaction. The transition probabilities that define the quantum
master equation can be directly translated into a visualisation of the
corresponding polariton energy landscape. This landscape exhibits a double
funnel structure, with a large barrier between the initial and final states.
This mechanism of resonant rate suppression is found to be robust to model
parameters and computational details, and thus expected to be general.

basic unit to construct our depth completion model in a pyramidal structure.
This hybrid architecture naturally benefits both the local connectivity of

heuristically selected proposals generated in the first stage and resulting in
spatially sparse training signals. In contrast, we propose the first

allows spatially dense training signals. A fundamental issue of this new design
is the quantization error caused by point-to-voxel discretization, which
inevitably leads to misalignment between two transformed views in the voxel
domain. To this end, we derive and implement closed-form rules that compensate
this misalignment onthe-fly. Our results are significant, e.g., promoting

therefore, existing analyses restrict their searches to frequencies above 1

paper, we show that timing model correlations are sensitive to sub-nanohertz
stochastic gravitational waves and perform a search using existing measurements

repeating flaring patterns in their gamma-ray light curves has not been
systematically explored. In this study, we aim to find repeating episodes of
flaring activity in the 100 brightest blazars using Fermi-LAT light curves with
various integration times. We use a Bayesian Blocks representation to convert
the time series into strings of symbols and search for repeating sub-strings
using a fuzzy search algorithm. As a result, we identify 27 repeated episodes
in the gamma-ray light curves of 10 blazars. We find that the patterns are most

seed photons produced in the non-uniform sheath through the inverse Compton
mechanism, resulting in a set of gamma-ray flares with a similar profile every
such passage. Additionally, we explore the theoretically-predicted possibility

sandwiched between ferromagnets which act as the source of magnons. Skyrmions
are topological objects while skyrmion crystals break internal and
translational symmetries, thus our setup allows us to study the interplay of
topology and symmetry breaking. Starting from a basis of holomorphic theta
functions, we construct an analytical ansatz for such a junction with finite
spatially modulating topological charge density in the central region and
vanishing in the leads. We then construct a suitably defined energy functional
for the junction and derive the resulting equations of motion, which resemble a
Bogoliubov-de Gennes-like equation. Using analytical techniques, field theory,
heuristic models and microscopic recursive transfer-matrix numerics, we
calculate the spectra and magnon transmission properties of the skyrmion
crystal. We find that magnon transmission can be understood via a combination
of low-energy Goldstone modes and effective emergent Landau levels at higher
energies. The former manifests in discrete low-energy peaks in the transmission
spectrum which reflect the nature of the Goldstone modes arising from symmetry
breaking. The latter, which reflect the topology, lead to band-like
transmission features, from the structure of which further details of the
excitation spectrum of the skyrmion crystal can be inferred. Such
characteristic transmission features are absent in competing phases of the

employed to mimic the neutrino field within a neutrino-dense source, might give
different results in terms of flavor evolution with respect to the

conclusions derived within a constrained framework should hold in an
astrophysical context. We show that the plane waves, commonly adopted in the
many-body literature to model the neutrino field, provide results that are
crucially different with respect to the ones obtained using wavepackets of
finite size streaming with a non-zero velocity. The many-body approach
intrinsically includes coherent and incoherent scatterings. The mean-field
approximation, on the other hand, only takes into account the coherent
scattering in the absence of the collision term. Even if incoherent scatterings
are included in the mean-field approach, the nature of the collision term is
different from that in the many-body approach. Because of this, if only a
finite number of neutrinos is considered, as often assumed, the two approaches
naturally lead to different flavor outcomes. These differences are further
exacerbated by vacuum mixing. We conclude that existing many-body literature,
based on closed neutrino systems with a finite number of particles, is neither
able to rule out nor assess the validity of the mean-field approach adopted to
simulate the evolution of the neutrino field in dense astrophysical sources,

to observable effects, we used idealized models of compact stars and made
side-by-side comparison of mode periods computed using a (i) Newtonian and (ii)

open question how curvature affects the flow of the spectral dimension. To
answer this question, we consider another class of restricted spin foam models,
so called spin foam frusta, which naturally exhibit oscillating amplitudes
induced by curvature, as well as an extension of the parameter space by a
cosmological constant. Numerically computing the spectral dimension of
$1$-periodic frusta geometries using extrapolated quantum amplitudes, we find
that quantum effects lead to a small change of spectral dimension at small
scales and an agreement to semi-classical results at larger scales. Adding a
cosmological constant $\Lambda$, we find additive corrections to the
non-oscillating result at the diffusion scale $\tau\sim 1/\sqrt{\Lambda}$.
Extending to $2$-periodic configurations, we observe a reduced effective
dimension, the form of which sensitively depends on the values of the
gravitational constant $G$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$. We provide
an intuition for our results based on an analytical estimate of the spectral
dimension. Furthermore, we present a simplified integrable model with
oscillating measure that qualitatively explains the features found numerically.
We argue that there exists a phase transition in the thermodynamic limit which
crucially depends on the parameters $G$ and $\Lambda$. The dependence on $G$

  Moreover, covariate effects generated from observed variables, such as

Identifying the shared and group-specific dietary components and covariate

is to better define the requirements for adequate organizational governance of

more informed decisions around AI adoption. To work towards this understanding,
we first identify how the standards for the AI adoption in healthcare may be
designed to be used easily and efficiently. Then, we map out the precise
decision points involved in the practical institutional adoption of AI
technology within specific health systems. Practically, we achieve this through
a multi-organizational collaboration with leaders from major health systems
across the United States and key informants from related fields. Working with
the consultancy IDEO [dot] org, we were able to conduct usability-testing
sessions with healthcare and AI ethics professionals. Usability analysis
revealed a prototype structured around mock key decision points that align with
how organizational leaders approach technology adoption. Concurrently, we
conducted semi-structured interviews with 89 professionals in healthcare and
other relevant fields. Using a modified grounded theory approach, we were able
to identify 8 key decision points and comprehensive procedures throughout the
AI adoption lifecycle. This is one of the most detailed qualitative analyses to

horizon, under certain conditions their energy $E_{c.m.}$ in the center of mass
frame can grow unbounded. This is the Ba\~{n}ados-Silk-West (BSW) effect.
Usually, this effect is considered for extremal horizons and geodesic (or
electrogedesic) trajectories. We study this effect in a more general context,
when both geometric and dynamic factors are taken into account. We consider
generic axially symmetric rotating black holes. The near-horizon behavior of
metric coefficients is determined by three numbers $p,~q,$ $k$ that appear in
the Taylor expansions for different types of a horizon$.$ This includes
nonextremal, extremal and ultraextremal horizons. We also give general
classification of possible trajectories that include so-called usual,
subcritical, critical and ultracritical ones depending on the near-horizon
behavior of the radial component of the four-velocity. We assume that particles
move not freely but under the action of some unspecified force. We find when
the finiteness of a force and the BSW effect are compatible with each other.
The BSW effect implies that one of two particles has fine-tuned parameters. We
show that such a particle always requires an infinite proper time for reaching
the horizon. Otherwise, either a force becomes infinite or a horizon fails to
be regular. This realizes the so-called principle of kinematic censorship that
forbids literally infinite $E_{c.m.}$ in any act of collision. The obtained
general results are illustrated for the Kerr-Newman-(anti-)de Sitter metric
used as an example. The description of diversity of trajectories suggested in
our work can be of use also in other contexts, beyond the BSW effect. In
particular, we find the relation between a force and the type of a trajectory.

objectives learn similar features even across architectures. These differences
arise early in the network and are primarily driven by attention and
normalization layers. We find that joint-embedding features yield better linear
probe transfer for classification because the different objectives drive
different distributions of information and invariances in the learned
representation. These differences explain opposite trends in transfer
performance for downstream tasks that require spatial specificity in features.
Finally, we address how fine-tuning changes reconstructive representations to
enable better transfer, showing that fine-tuning re-organizes the information
to be more similar to pre-trained joint embedding models.

systems in which an attacker attempts to estimate (or extract) the feedback
controller of the system. Extracting (or estimating) the controller provides an
unmatched edge to attackers since it allows them to predict the future control
actions of the system and plan their attack accordingly. Hence, it is important
to understand the ability of the attackers to perform such an attack. In this
paper, we focus on the setting when a Deep Neural Network (DNN) controller is
trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms and is used to control a
stochastic system. We play the role of the attacker that aims to estimate such
an unknown DNN controller, and we propose a two-phase algorithm. In the first
phase, also called the offline phase, the attacker uses side-channel
information about the RL-reward function and the system dynamics to identify a
set of candidate estimates of the unknown DNN. In the second phase, also called
the online phase, the attacker observes the behavior of the unknown DNN and
uses these observations to shortlist the set of final policy estimates. We
provide theoretical analysis of the error between the unknown DNN and the
estimated one. We also provide numerical results showing the effectiveness of
the proposed algorithm.

interconnected data on the Web; on the other side, Labeled Property Graphs
(LPGs) are geared towards efficient graph processing and have strong roots in
developer and engineering communities. The two models look at graphs from
different abstraction layers (triples in RDF vs. edges connecting vertices with
inlined properties in LPGs), expose - at least at the surface - distinct
features, come with different query languages, and are embedded into their own
software ecosystems. In this short paper, we introduce a novel unifying graph
data model called Statement Graphs, which combines the traits of both RDF and
LPG and achieves interoperability at different levels: it (a) provides the
ability to manage RDF and LPG data as a single, interconnected graph, (b)
supports querying over the integrated graph using any RDF or LPG query
language, while (c) clearing the way for graph stack independent data exchange
mechanisms and formats. We formalize our new model as directed acyclic graphs

achieve nearly state-of-the-art performance in image recognition tasks using

to SNNs that are little studied: Do SNNs trained with surrogate gradient learn
different representations from traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)?
Does the time dimension in SNNs provide unique representation power? In this
paper, we aim to answer these questions by conducting a representation
similarity analysis between SNNs and ANNs using Centered Kernel Alignment
(CKA). We start by analyzing the spatial dimension of the networks, including
both the width and the depth. Furthermore, our analysis of residual connections
shows that SNNs learn a periodic pattern, which rectifies the representations
in SNNs to be ANN-like. We additionally investigate the effect of the time
dimension on SNN representation, finding that deeper layers encourage more
dynamics along the time dimension. We also investigate the impact of input data
such as event-stream data and adversarial attacks. Our work uncovers a host of
new findings of representations in SNNs. We hope this work will inspire future
research to fully comprehend the representation power of SNNs. Code is released

promising technique that can achieve the stringent requirement of high data
rate in the next-generation wireless networks, yet its severe propagation
attenuation significantly hinders its implementation in practice. Finding beam
directions for a large-scale antenna array to effectively overcome severe
propagation attenuation of THz signals is a pressing need. This paper proposes
a novel approach of federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) to swiftly
perform THz-beam search for multiple base stations (BSs) coordinated by an edge
server in a cellular network. All the BSs conduct deep deterministic policy
gradient (DDPG)-based DRL to obtain THz beamforming policy with limited channel
state information (CSI). They update their DDPG models with hidden information
in order to mitigate inter-cell interference. We demonstrate that the cell
network can achieve higher throughput as more THz CSI and hidden neurons of
DDPG are adopted. We also show that FDRL with partial model update is able to
nearly achieve the same performance of FDRL with full model update, which
indicates an effective means to reduce communication load between the edge
server and the BSs by partial model uploading. Moreover, the proposed FDRL
outperforms conventional non-learning-based and existing non-FDRL benchmark
optimization methods.

potential for quantum technologies. Quenched randomness is a new paradigm in
elucidating the emergence of spin-liquidlike states in geometrically frustrated

nearest-neighbor ions constitute a two-dimensional square lattice. The negative
value of Curie-Weiss temperature, obtained from the Curie-Weiss fit of
high-temperature magnetic susceptibility data indicates the presence of
antiferromagnetic interaction between Cu2+ moments. Specific heat data show the
absence of long-range magnetic ordering down to 64 mK despite a reasonably
strong exchange interaction between Cu2+ spins as reflected from a Curie-Weiss
temperature of -27 K. The power-law behavior and the data collapse of specific
heat and magnetization data evince the emergence of a random-singlet state in
Sr3CuTa2O9. The power-law-like spin auto-correlation function and the data
collapse of muon polarization asymmetry with longitudinal field dependence of
t/({\mu}0H){\gamma} further support credence to the presence of a

formation when the interaction strength between these excitons and the confined
light modes of an optical resonator exceeds their decay rates. While the
polariton lifetime is determined by the Q(uality)-factor of the optical
resonator, the polariton group velocity is not. Instead, the latter is solely
determined by the polariton dispersion. Yet, experiments suggest that the
Q-factor also controls the polariton propagation velocity. To understand this
observation, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of Rhodamine
chromophores strongly coupled to Fabry-P\'erot cavities with various Q-factors.
Our results suggest that propagation in the aforementioned experiments is
initially dominated by ballistic motion of upper polariton states at their
group velocities, which leads to a rapid expansion of the wavepacket. Cavity
decay in combination with non-adiabatic population transfer into dark states,
rapidly depletes these bright states, causing the wavepacket to contract.
However, because population transfer is reversible, propagation continues, but
as a diffusion process, at lower velocity. By controlling the lifetime of
bright states, the Q-factor determines the duration of the ballistic phase and
the diffusion coefficient in the diffusive regime. Thus, polariton propagation
in organic microcavities can be effectively tuned through the Q-factor.

named entities have been identified as a likely reason for low performance of

entities could be challenging to model. They also represent missed learning
opportunities for self-supervised models: the link between named entity and
object in the image may be missed by the model, but it would not be if the
object were mentioned using a more common term. In this work, we investigate
hypernymization as a way to deal with named entities for pretraining
grounding-based multi-modal models and for fine-tuning on open-vocabulary

We run experiments on data from Wikipedia and from The New York Times. We
report improved pretraining performance on objects of interest following
hypernymization, and we show the promise of hypernymization on open-vocabulary

neighborhood process of the directed chain or input) into the drift and
diffusion coefficients of the directed chain SDEs with distributional

the neighborhood process, and the neighborhood process will provide the key
step in learning and generating multimodal distributed time series. The
proposed DC-GANs are examined on four datasets, including two stochastic models
from social sciences and computational neuroscience, and two real-world
datasets on stock prices and energy consumption. To our best knowledge, DC-GANs

for highly dynamic and feedback-based manoeuvres, and accurate simulators are
crucial to providing cheap and abundant data to learn the desired behaviour.
Nevertheless, the simulated data are noiseless and generally show a
distributional shift that challenges the deployment on real machines where
sensor readings are affected by noise. The standard solution is modelling the
latter and injecting it during training; while this requires a thorough system
identification, Roll-Drop enhances the robustness to sensor noise by tuning

Within the framework of a simple model of Dirac fields in the Euclidean Rindler

finite temperature, but the temperature itself is of a quantum origin (the
Unruh temperature). Moreover, the phase transition point is uniquely associated
with the behavior of individual levels, namely at the Unruh temperature the two
lowest Matsubara modes become singular on the Rindler horizon. This provides a
new manifestation of the duality between the thermodynamic description and the
geometric approach (the behavior of the quantum levels of particles living on a

massively scaled video networks has driven the need for video quality
assessment (VQA) algorithms that better account for distortions on HDR content.
In particular, standard VQA models may fail to capture conspicuous distortions
at the extreme ends of the dynamic range, because the features that drive them
may be dominated by distortions {that pervade the mid-ranges of the signal}. We
introduce a new approach whereby a local expansive nonlinearity emphasizes
distortions occurring at the higher and lower ends of the {local} luma range,
allowing for the definition of additional quality-aware features that are
computed along a separate path. These features are not HDR-specific, and also
improve VQA on SDR video contents, albeit to a reduced degree. We show that
this preprocessing step significantly boosts the power of distortion-sensitive
natural video statistics (NVS) features when used to predict the quality of HDR
content. In similar manner, we separately compute novel wide-gamut color
features using the same nonlinear processing steps. We have found that our

then to link this description to its macroscopic counterpart based on

introduced here is a sub-Poissonian state where the large n asymptotic of the
probability of finding n particles in a given vessel is similar to that for
noninteracting entities, for which macro- and microscopic descriptions are
equivalent. To illustrate the concept, an individual based model of an infinite
population of interacting entities is proposed and analyzed. For this
population, its evolution preserves sub-Poissonian states, that allows one to
describe it through the correlation functions of such states for which a chain
of evolution equations is obtained. The corresponding kinetic equation is

also known as selective forgetting or unlearning, is often conducted by
partitioning a dataset into shards, training fully independent models on each,
then ensembling the resulting models. Increasing the number of shards reduces
the expected cost to forget but at the same time it increases inference cost
and reduces the final accuracy of the model since synergistic information
between samples is lost during the independent model training. Rather than
treating each shard as independent, SAFE introduces the notion of a shard
graph, which allows incorporating limited information from other shards during
training, trading off a modest increase in expected forgetting cost with a
significant increase in accuracy, all while still attaining complete removal of
residual influence after forgetting. SAFE uses a lightweight system of adapters

the coupling of the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom. Here we use
continuous wave laser excitation to probe the symmetries of TiSe$_2$ using the

professional training. We propose an algorithm capable of generating multiple
node graphs from different types of prompts, significantly lowering the bar for
users to explore a specific design space. Previous work was limited to
unconditional generation of random node graphs, making the generation of an
envisioned material challenging. We propose a multi-modal node graph generation
neural architecture for high-quality procedural material synthesis which can be
conditioned on different inputs (text or image prompts), using a CLIP-based
encoder. We also create a substantially augmented material graph dataset, key
to improving the generation quality. Finally, we generate high-quality graph
samples using a regularized sampling process and improve the matching quality
by differentiable optimization for top-ranked samples. We compare our methods
to CLIP-based database search baselines (which are themselves novel) and
achieve superior or similar performance without requiring massive data storage.
We further show that our model can produce a set of material graphs
unconditionally, conditioned on images, text prompts or partial graphs, serving
as a tool for automatic visual programming completion.

  Non-intrusive Load Disaggregation Approach for Commercial Buildings","33 pages, 18 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Building energy flexibility has been increasingly demonstrated as a
cost-effective solution to respond to the needs of energy networks, including
electric grids and district cooling and heating systems, improving the
integration of intermittent renewable energy sources. Adjusting zonal
temperature set-points is one of the most promising measures to unlock the
energy flexibility potential of central air conditioning systems in complex
commercial buildings. However, most existing studies focused on quantifying the
energy flexibility on the building level since only building-level energy
consumption is normally metered in commercial buildings. This study aims to
investigate the impacts of temperature set-point adjustment strategies on
zone-level thermal and energy performance by developing a non-intrusive
data-driven load disaggregation method (i.e., a virtual zonal power meter).
Three university buildings in Northern California were selected to test the
proposed load disaggregation method. We found that heterogeneities of energy
use and energy flexibility existed across not only buildings but also air
handling units (AHUs) and zones. Moreover, a small number of zones accounted
for a large amount of energy use and energy flexibility; and the most
energy-intensive zones are not necessarily the most energy-flexible zones. For
the three tested buildings, the top 30% most energy-intensive zones accounted
for around 60% of the total energy use; and the top 30% most energy-flexible
zones provided around 80% of the total energy flexibility. The proposed method
enables the electric grid or district energy system operators to regard the
controlled energy-flexible entities as a fleet of AHUs or zones instead of a
fleet of buildings and helps unlock the possibility for targeted demand
flexibility strategies that balance zone-by-zone energy reduction with
zone-by-zone costs to occupants.

simple update (SU) method has been used to investigate the time evolution of a
two-dimensional U(1) critical spin-1/2 spin liquid under Hamiltonian quench
[Phys. Rev. B 106, 195132 (2022)]. Here we introduce two different variational
frameworks to describe the time dynamics of SU(2)-symmetric
translationally-invariant PEPS, aiming to improve the accuracy. In one
approach, after using a Trotter-Suzuki decomposition of the time evolution
operator in term of two-site elementary gates, one considers a single bond
embedded in an environment approximated by a Corner Transfer Matrix
Renormalization Group (CTMRG). A variational update of the two tensors on the
bond is performed under the application of the elementary gate and then, after
symmetrization of the site tensors, the environment is updated. In the second
approach, a cluster optimization is performed on a finite (periodic) cluster,
maximizing the overlap of the exact time-evolved state with a symmetric
finite-size PEPS ansatz. Observables are then computed on the infinite lattice
contracting the infinite-PEPS (iPEPS) by CTMRG. We show that the variational
schemes outperform the SU method and remain accurate over a significant time
interval before hitting the entanglement barrier. Studying the spectrum of the
transfer matrix, we found that the asymptotic correlations are very well
preserved under time evolution, including the critical nature of the singlet
correlations, as expected from the Lieb-Robinson (LR) bound theorem. We also
compute the time-evolution of the short distance spin-spin correlations and
estimate the LR velocity.

requirements can be grouped into one cluster. The hybrid beamformer design and
power allocation problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate of the users

by using optical forces acting on the states of a two-level atom via
bichromatic coherent pumping of a cold atomic gas trapped inside a single-mode

used to gather and concentrate excited state atoms in regions of strong

numerical simulations of a sufficiently large atomic ensemble, we rely on a
second-order cumulant expansion and describe the atomic motion in a
semi-classical point-particle approximation subject to position-dependent light
shifts which induce optical gradient forces along the cavity axis. We study
minimal conditions on pump laser intensities and detunings required for

hydraulic fracturing to enhance the permeability of natural formations and
allow for sufficient fluid circulation. Over the past few decades, the
phase-field method has grown in popularity as a valid approach to modeling
hydraulic fracturing because of the ease of handling complex fracture
propagation geometries. However, existing phase-field methods cannot
appropriately capture nucleation of hydraulic fractures because their
formulations are solely energy-based and do not explicitly take into account
the strength of the material. Thus, in this work, we propose a novel
phase-field formulation for hydraulic fracturing with the main goal of modeling
fracture nucleation in porous media, e.g., rocks. Built on the variational
formulation of previous phase-field methods, the proposed model incorporates
the material strength envelope for hydraulic fracture nucleation through two
important steps: (i) an external driving force term, included in the damage
evolution equation, that accounts for the material strength; (ii) a properly
designed damage function that defines the fluid pressure contribution on the
crack driving force. The comparison of numerical results for two-dimensional
(2D) test cases with existing analytical solutions demonstrates that the
proposed phase-field model can accurately model both nucleation and propagation
of hydraulic fractures. Additionally, we present the simulation of hydraulic
fracturing in a three-dimensional (3D) domain with various stress conditions to
demonstrate the applicability of the method to realistic scenarios.

increasing growth temperature, which is reduced or vanishes upon annealing at
temperatures above the growth temperature. The proposed explanation for this
growth-induced anisotropy in high orbital moment Tb-based transition metal
alloys such as a-Tb-Co is an amorphous phase texturing with preferential
in-plane and out-of-plane local bonding configurations for the rare-earth and

trend in MRO indicates a relationship between the magnetic anisotropy and local
atomic ordering. Tilting select films between 0$^{\circ}$ and 40$^{\circ}$ in
the TEM measures variations in the local atomic structure a function of
orientation within the films. The findings support claims that preferential
ordering along the growth direction results from temperature-mediated adatom
configurations during deposition, and that oriented MRO correlates with the

Solar pores are regions of intensified magnetic field strength compared to the

understand the properties and behaviour of magnetic fields in the Sun. Up to
now, there exists only a single study on magnetic field properties at the
boundary region of a pore. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to increase
the statistics of magnetic properties determining the pore boundary region. We
analyse six solar pores using data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
instrument on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. We apply image processing
techniques to extract the relevant features of the solar pores and determine
the boundary conditions of the magnetic fields. We find the maximal vertical
magnetic field values on the boundaries of the studied solar pores to range
from 1400~G to 1600~G, with a standard deviation between 7.8\% and 14.8\%.
These values are lower than those reported in the mentioned preceding study.
However, this can be explained by differences in spatial resolution as well as
the type of data we used. The vertical magnetic field is an important factor in
determining the boundary of solar pores, and it plays a more relevant role than
the intensity gradient. The obtained information will be useful for future
studies on the formation and evolution of magnetic structures of the Sun.
Additionally, this study highlights the importance of high spatial resolution
data for the purpose of accurately characterising the magnetic properties of
solar pores.

multi-view geospatial imagery or LiDAR point clouds which can be expensive to
acquire. Single-view height estimation using neural network based models shows
promise however it can struggle with reconstructing high resolution features.
The latest advancements in diffusion models for high resolution image synthesis
and editing have yet to be utilized for remote sensing imagery, particularly
height estimation. Our approach involves training a generative diffusion model
to learn the joint distribution of optical and DSM images across both domains
as a Markov chain. This is accomplished by minimizing a denoising score
matching objective while being conditioned on the source image to generate
realistic high resolution 3D surfaces. In this paper we experiment with
conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) for height
estimation from a single remotely sensed image and show promising results on
the Vaihingen benchmark dataset.

infinite-dimensional Banach spaces of functions. They are gaining increased
attention in computational science and engineering, due to their potential both
to accelerate traditional numerical methods and to enable data-driven
discovery. A popular variant of neural operators is the Fourier neural operator
(FNO). Previous analysis proving universal operator approximation theorems for
FNOs resorts to use of an unbounded number of Fourier modes and limits the
basic form of the method to problems with periodic geometry. Prior work relies
on intuition from traditional numerical methods, and interprets the FNO as a
nonstandard and highly nonlinear spectral method. The present work challenges
this point of view in two ways: (i) the work introduces a new broad class of
operator approximators, termed nonlocal neural operators (NNOs), which allow
for operator approximation between functions defined on arbitrary geometries,
and includes the FNO as a special case; and (ii) analysis of the NNOs shows
that, provided this architecture includes computation of a spatial average
(corresponding to retaining only a single Fourier mode in the special case of
the FNO) it benefits from universal approximation. It is demonstrated that this
theoretical result unifies the analysis of a wide range of neural operator
architectures. Furthermore, it sheds new light on the role of nonlocality, and
its interaction with nonlinearity, thereby paving the way for a more systematic
exploration of nonlocality, both through the development of new operator

crucial in governing the poleward transport of warm water. Canyons on the
continental slope may provide a pathway for warm water to cross the slope
current and intrude onto the continental shelf underneath ice shelves, which
can increase rates of ice shelf melting, leading to reduced buttressing of ice
shelves, accelerating glacial flow and hence increased sea level rise.
Observations and modelling studies of the Antarctic Slope Current and
cross-shelf warm water intrusions are limited, particularly in the East
Antarctica region. To explore this topic, an idealised configuration of the
Antarctic Slope Current is developed, using an eddy-resolving isopycnal model
that emulates the dynamics and topography of the East Antarctic sector. Warm
water intrusions via canyons are found to occur in discrete episodes, with
large onshore flow induced by eddies. The episodic nature of cross-shelf warm
water transport is demonstrated, with canyon width playing a key role in
modulating cross-shelf exchanges; warm water transport through narrower canyons
is more irregular than transport through wider canyons. The episodic
cross-shelf transport is driven by a cycle of rising and falling rates of eddy
generation in the Antarctic Slope Current, a variability intrinsic to the slope
current that can be explained without any temporal variability in external
forcings. Improved understanding of the intrinsic variability of warm water
intrusions can help guide future observational and modelling studies in the
analysis of eddy impacts on Antarctic shelf circulation.

natural tool for adversarial example generation to achieve multiple

prioritize jobs. For models more complex than the M/G/1, optimal scheduling is
generally intractable. This leads us to ask: beyond the M/G/1, does Gittins
still perform well?
  Recent results indicate that Gittins performs well in the M/G/k, meaning that
its additive suboptimality gap is bounded by an expression which is negligible
in heavy traffic. But allowing multiple servers is just one way to extend the
M/G/1, and most other extensions remain open. Does Gittins still perform well
with non-Poisson arrival processes? Or if servers require setup times when
transitioning from idle to busy?
  In this paper, we give the first analysis of the Gittins policy that can
handle any combination of (a) multiple servers, (b) non-Poisson arrivals, and
(c) setup times. Our results thus cover the G/G/1 and G/G/k, with and without
setup times, bounding Gittins's suboptimality gap in each case. Each of (a),
(b), and (c) adds a term to our bound, but all the terms are negligible in
heavy traffic, thus implying Gittins's heavy-traffic optimality in all the

photometric data obtained with TESS. The MUSICOS campaign aimed to achieve
high-resolution spectroscopic observations from many sites around the globe, so
that uninterrupted phase coverage of EI Eri became available. We use these data
to reconstruct successive surface temperature maps of the star in order to
study the changes of starspots on a very short timescale.
  We use long-term, seasonal period analysis of our photometric time series to
study changes in the rotational period. Short-term Fourier-transform is also
applied to look for activity cycle-like changes. We also study the phase and
frequency distribution of hand-selected flares. We apply our multi-line Doppler
imaging code to reconstruct four consecutive Doppler images. These images are
also used to measure surface differential rotation by our cross-correlation
technique. In addition, we carry out tests to demonstrate how Doppler imaging
is affected by the fact that the data came from several different instruments
with different spectral resolutions.
  Seasonal period analysis of the light curve reveals a smooth, significant
change in period, possibly indicating the evolution of active latitudes.
Temperature curves from $B-V$ and $V-I$ show slight differences, indicating the
activity of EI Eri is spot dominated. Short-term Fourier transform reveals
smoothly changing cycles between 4.5--5.5 and 8.9--11.6 years. The
time-resolved spotted surface of EI Eri from Doppler imaging enabled us to
follow the evolution of the different surface features. Cross-correlating the
consecutive Doppler maps reveal surface shear of $\alpha=0.036\pm0.007$. Our
tests validate our approach and show that the surface temperature distribution
is adequately reconstructed by our method.

conceptually important and practically useful for quantum computing. However,
topological orders lack conventional order parameters and are generically
difficult to diagnose. Recent advances in quantum simulations have further
emphasized the need for efficient methods for identifying topological orders. A
breakthrough in this problem is the discovery of topological entanglement
entropy, which can be used to detect nontrivial topological order from a ground
state wave function, but is far from enough for fully determining the
topological order. In this work, we take a key step further in this direction:
We propose a simple entanglement-based protocol for extracting the quantum
dimensions of all anyons from a single ground state wave function in two
dimensions. The choice of the space manifold and the ground state is arbitrary.
This protocol is first validated in the continuum using Chern-Simons field
theories, and then analytically verified on lattices using Kitaev's quantum
double models. We anticipate that our protocol can be implemented
experimentally in various quantum simulation platforms, as well as in numerics.

that bond-dependent anisotropy can stabilise novel magnetic phases and exotic
spin dynamics on the geometrically frustrated triangular lattice. However, few
materials have been identified with simultaneous geometric frustration and
bond-dependent anisotropy. Here, we report a frustrated triangular lattice with
bond-dependent anisotropy in the cobalt-based triangular van der Waals
antiferromagnet CoI2. Its momentum and energy-resolved spin dynamics exhibit
substantial magnon breakdown and complex level repulsion, as measured by
inelastic neutron scattering. A thorough examination of excitations in both the

eruptive flare in solar cycle 25. Coronal magnetic field reconstructions reveal
a magnetic flux rope (MFR) with configuration highly consistent with a filament
existing for a long period before the flare, and the eruption of the whole
filament indicates that the MFR erupted during the flare. However, quantitative
analysis shows that the pre-flare MFR resides in a height too low to trigger a
torus instability (TI). The filament experienced a slow rise before the flare
onset, for which we estimate evolution of the filament height using a
triangulation method by combining the SDO and STEREO observations, and find it
is also much lower than the critical height for triggering TI. On the other
hand, the pre-flare evolution of the current density shows progressive thinning
of a vertical current layer on top of the flare PIL, which suggests that a
vertical current sheet forms before the eruption. Meanwhile, there is
continuously shearing motion along the PIL under the main branch of the
filament, which can drive the coronal field to form such a current sheet. As
such, we suggest that the event follows a reconnection-based initiation
mechanism as recently established using a high-accuracy MHD simulation, in
which an eruption is initiated by reconnection in a current sheet that forms
gradually within continuously-sheared magnetic arcade. The eruption should be
further driven by TI as the filament quickly rises into the TI domain during
the eruption.

It has also become an important part of satellite-air-ground-sea integrated
network (SAGS) for 6G communication. In order to achieve high mobility, UAV has
strict requirements on communication latency, and it cannot be illegally
controlled as weapons of attack with malicious intentions. Therefore, an
efficient and secure communication method specifically designed for UAV network
is required. This paper proposes a communication mechanism named ESCM for the
above requirements. For high efficiency of communication, ESCM designs a
routing protocol based on artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) for UAV network
to accelerate communication between UAVs. Meanwhile, we plan to use blockchain
to guarantee the communication security of UAV networks. However, blockchain
has unstable links in high mobility network scenarios, resulting in low
consensus efficiency and high communication overhead. Therefore, ESCM also
introduces the concept of the digital twin, mapping the UAVs from the physical
world into Cyberspace, transforming the UAV network into a static network. And
this virtual UAV network is called CyberUAV. Then, in CyberUAV, we design a
blockchain system and propose a consensus algorithm based on network coding,
named proof of network coding (PoNC). PoNC not only ensures the security of
ESCM, but also further improves the performance of ESCM through network coding.
Simulation results show that ESCM has obvious advantages in communication
efficiency and security. Moreover, encoding messages through PoNC consensus can
increase the network throughput, and make mobile blockchain static through
digital twin can improve the consensus success rate.

marginally detected above the three times the rms level within a velocity range
of approximately 2250-2450 km/s, slightly red-shifted with respect to the
systemic velocity. H2O maser emission is located approximately 1 milliarcsecond
(mas) east of the brightest continuum component at 22 GHz, where the continuum
spectrum is optically thick, that is at the free-free absorbed receding jet by
ionized gas. A positional coincidence between H2O maser emission and an ionized
gas disk implies that the H2O maser emission arises from the near side of the
disk, amplifying continuum emission from the background receding jet. If the
disk axis is oriented 64 degree relative to the line of sight, the H2O maser
emission is expected to be at a mean radius of 0.3 pc in the disk. The broad
line width of the H2O maser emission can be attributed to complex kinematics in
the immediate vicinity of the supermassive black hole (SMBH), including ongoing
gas infall onto the SMBH, turbulence, and outflow. This is analogous to the
multi-phase circumnuclear torus model in the nearest radio-loud H2O megamaser

models the interactions between a content provider (CP) and multiple mobile

storage resources for content caching in exchange for rewards. We introduce
efficient decentralized gradient play algorithms for Nash equilibrium (NE)
computation by exchanging local information among neighboring MEDs only, thus
preventing attackers from learning users' private information. The key
challenge in designing such algorithms is that communication among MEDs is not
fixed and is facilitated by a sequence of undirected time-varying graphs. Our
approach achieves linear convergence to the NE without imposing any assumptions
on the values of parameters in the local objective functions, such as requiring
strong monotonicity to be stronger than its dependence on other MEDs' actions,
which is commonly required in existing literature when the graph is directed
time-varying. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in achieving efficient resource outsourcing decisions while preserving

stress $\sigma$ into two parts, where neither part is required to satisfy
strain compatibility. The first part, $\sigma_p$, is any stress in equilibrium
with the loading. The second part, $\sigma_h$, is a self-equilibrated stress
field on the unloaded body. In both methods, $\sigma_h$ is expanded using
tensor-valued global stress basis functions developed elsewhere. In the first
method, the coefficients in the expansion are found by minimizing the strain
energy based on the well-known complementary energy principle. For the second
method, which is restricted to planar homogeneous isotropic bodies, we show
that we merely need to minimize the squared $L^2$ norm of the trace of stress.
For demonstration, we solve eight stress problems involving sharp corners,

3.5 mm is also larger than that at 1.3 mm. This larger and thicker ring
indicates a substantial contribution from the accretion flow with absorption
effects in addition to the gravitationally lensed ring-like emission. The
images show that the edge-brightened jet connects to the accretion flow of the
black hole. Close to the black hole, the emission profile of the jet-launching
region is wider than the expected profile of a black-hole-driven jet,
suggesting the possible presence of a wind associated with the accretion flow.

exploiting the resources of the website visitors. To understand and counter
such attacks, we systematically analyze the static, dynamic, and economic

currency, and code-based categorization of cryptojacking samples to 1) measure
their distribution across websites, 2) highlight their platform affinities, and
3) study their code complexities. We apply machine learning techniques to
distinguish cryptojacking scripts from benign and malicious JavaScript samples
with 100\% accuracy. For dynamic analysis, we analyze the effect of
cryptojacking on critical system resources, such as CPU and battery usage. We
also perform web browser fingerprinting to analyze the information exchange
between the victim node and the dropzone cryptojacking server. We also build an
analytical model to empirically evaluate the feasibility of cryptojacking as an
alternative to online advertisement. Our results show a sizeable negative

Finally, leveraging insights from our analyses, we build countermeasures for
in-browser cryptojacking that improve the existing remedies.

systematic improvements in T$_1$ coherence times. We fabricate devices using an
encapsulation strategy that involves passivating the surface of niobium and
thereby preventing the formation of its lossy surface oxide. By maintaining the
same superconducting metal and only varying the surface structure, this
comparative investigation examining different capping materials and film
substrates across different qubit foundries definitively demonstrates the
detrimental impact that niobium oxides have on the coherence times of
superconducting qubits, compared to native oxides of tantalum, aluminum or
titanium nitride. Our surface-encapsulated niobium qubit devices exhibit T$_1$
coherence times 2 to 5 times longer than baseline niobium qubit devices with
native niobium oxides. When capping niobium with tantalum, we obtain median
qubit lifetimes above 200 microseconds. Our comparative structural and chemical
analysis suggests that amorphous niobium suboxides may induce higher losses.
These results are in line with high-accuracy measurements of the niobium oxide
loss tangent obtained with ultra-high Q superconducting radiofrequency (SRF)
cavities. This new surface encapsulation strategy enables further reduction of
dielectric losses via passivation with ambient-stable materials, while
preserving fabrication and scalable manufacturability thanks to the
compatibility with silicon processes.

accomplished by any informationally complete (non necessarily symmetric)

data-driven inferential approach, the reconstruction, while possible with
designs, cannot by accomplished anymore by an arbitrary informationally
complete structure. Hence, we propose the data-driven inference as the arena in
which the role of designs naturally emerges. Our inferential approach is based
on a minimality principle according to which, among all the possible inferences
consistent with the data, the weakest should be preferred, in the sense of
majorization theory and statistical comparison.

taking both the turbulence intensity in the collapsing cloud core and the
fragmentation velocity of dust particles as parameters. When the turbulence
intensity is small, the dust particles do not grow significantly, and the
non-ideal MHD effects work efficiently in high-density regions. The dust
particles rapidly grow in a strongly turbulent environment, while the
efficiency of non-ideal MHD effects in such an environment depends on the
fragmentation velocity of the dust particles. When the fragmentation velocity
is small, turbulence promotes coagulation growth and collisional fragmentation
of dust particles, producing small dust particles. In this case, the adsorption
of charged particles on the dust particle surfaces becomes efficient and the
abundance of charged particles decreases, making non-ideal MHD effects
effective at high densities. On the other hand, when the fragmentation velocity
is high, dust particles are less likely to fragment, even if the turbulence is
strong. In this case, the production of small dust particles become inefficient
and non-ideal MHD effects become less effective. We also investigate the effect
of the dust composition on the star and disk formation processes. We constrain
the turbulence intensity of a collapsing core and the fragmentation velocity of
dust for circumstellar disk formation due to the dissipation of the magnetic

sensing nodes for industrial monitoring, and such efforts have produced
sizeable condition monitoring datasets that can be used to build diagnosis
algorithms capable of warning maintenance engineers of impending failure or
identifying current system health conditions. However, single operators may not
have sufficiently large fleets of systems or component units to collect
sufficient data to develop data-driven algorithms. Collecting a satisfactory
quantity of fault patterns for safety-critical systems is particularly
difficult due to the rarity of faults. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a
promising solution to leverage datasets from multiple operators to train a
decentralized asset fault diagnosis model while maintaining data
confidentiality. However, there are still considerable obstacles to overcome
when it comes to optimizing the federation strategy without leaking sensitive
data and addressing the issue of client dataset heterogeneity. This is
particularly prevalent in fault diagnosis applications due to the high
diversity of operating conditions and system configurations. To address these
two challenges, we propose a novel clustering-based FL algorithm where clients
are clustered for federating based on dataset similarity. To quantify dataset
similarity between clients without explicitly sharing data, each client sets
aside a local test dataset and evaluates the other clients' model prediction
accuracy and uncertainty on this test dataset. Clients are then clustered for
FL based on relative prediction accuracy and uncertainty.

natural language processing, making them highly effective in many human
life-related or even job-related tasks. The attention mechanism in the
Transformer architecture is a critical component of LLMs, as it allows the
model to selectively focus on specific input parts. The softmax unit, which is
a key part of the attention mechanism, normalizes the attention scores. Hence,
the performance of LLMs in various NLP tasks depends significantly on the
crucial role played by the attention mechanism with the softmax unit.
  In-context learning, as one of the celebrated abilities of recent LLMs, is an
important concept in querying LLMs such as ChatGPT. Without further parameter
updates, Transformers can learn to predict based on few in-context examples.
However, the reason why Transformers becomes in-context learners is not well
understood. Recently, several works [ASA+22,GTLV22,ONR+22] have studied the
in-context learning from a mathematical perspective based on a linear
regression formulation $\min_x\| Ax - b \|_2$, which show Transformers'
capability of learning linear functions in context.
  In this work, we study the in-context learning based on a softmax regression
formulation $\min_{x} \| \langle \exp(Ax), {\bf 1}_n \rangle^{-1} \exp(Ax) - b
\|_2$ of Transformer's attention mechanism. We show the upper bounds of the
data transformations induced by a single self-attention layer and by
gradient-descent on a $\ell_2$ regression loss for softmax prediction function,
which imply that when training self-attention-only Transformers for fundamental
regression tasks, the models learned by gradient-descent and Transformers show
great similarity.

However, these methods typically calculate the correlation between the model's
output and item embeddings, which may suffer from inconsistencies between
high-level feature vectors and low-level feature embeddings, thereby hindering
further model learning. To address this issue, we propose a dual-tower
retrieval architecture for sequence recommendation. In this architecture, the
predicted embedding from the user encoder is used to retrieve the generated
embedding from the item encoder, thereby alleviating the issue of inconsistent
feature levels. Moreover, in order to further improve the retrieval performance
of the model, we also propose a self-supervised multi-modal pretraining method

approach. The description of final state interactions between the $D\pi$ pair

region around the $D^{*}$ pole mass. So one can obtain the branching ratios for
the corresponding two-body decays $B_c\to D^{*+}h$ under the narrow width

embedding of every single image. Therefore, during the episodic training of
FSL, these methods cannot capture and fully utilize the local visual
information in image samples and the data structure information of the whole
episode, which are beneficial to FSL. To this end, we propose to augment the
few-shot learning objective with a novel self-supervised Episodic Spatial
Pretext Task (ESPT). Specifically, for each few-shot episode, we generate its
corresponding transformed episode by applying a random geometric transformation
to all the images in it. Based on these, our ESPT objective is defined as
maximizing the local spatial relationship consistency between the original
episode and the transformed one. With this definition, the ESPT-augmented FSL
objective promotes learning more transferable feature representations that
capture the local spatial features of different images and their
inter-relational structural information in each input episode, thus enabling
the model to generalize better to new categories with only a few samples.
Extensive experiments indicate that our ESPT method achieves new

to below 1 mTorr or above 40 mTorr, respectively. The observations could be

semiconductors is being increasingly exploited for realising a variety of
practical quantum sensing devices. A prime example is the on-going development
of compact magnetometers based on the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in diamond
for the remote sensing of magnetic signals with high accuracy and sensitivity.
In these applications, the ODMR-active material is integrated into the overall
apparatus to form a self-contained sensor. However, some emerging applications
require the sensing material to be in physical contact with an external object
of interest, thus requiring an independent readout device. Here we present an
ODMR-meter, a compact device specially designed to allow convenient,
contactless monitoring of ODMR in a target object, and demonstrate its
application to temperature monitoring with NV defects. Our prototype is
composed of a handheld readout head (integrating all the necessary optical
components and a microwave antenna) and a control box connected to a laptop
computer, all made primarily from commercial off-the-shelf components. We test
our device using an NV-rich bulk diamond as the object, demonstrate a
temperature sensitivity of $10~{\rm mK}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ in static conditions,
and demonstrate the feasibility of handheld operation. The limitations to
measurement speed, sensitivity and accuracy are discussed. The presented device
may find immediate use in medical and industrial applications where accurate
thermometry is required, and can be extended to magnetic field measurements.

comprehend the product sufficiently and quickly. It can take anywhere from six
months to several years for them to attain mastery but they need to start
delivering results much before. SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) products have
sophisticated system architecture which adds to the time and effort of
understanding them. On the other hand, time available to new hires for product
understanding continues to be short and getting shorter, given the pressure to
deliver more in less time. Constructivist theory views learning as a personal
process in which the learner constructs new knowledge for themselves. Building
and refining a mental model is the key way in which they learn, similar to how
the brain operates. This paper presents an approach to improve system
comprehension process by using a system model that a) acts as a transitional
object to aid and refine the mental model of the learner, and b) captures the
current understanding of the dynamics of the software system in a way that can
be reasoned with and simulated.
  We have adapted discrete systems modeling techniques and used a transition
system as a lightweight modeling language. Such a model can be used by novice
engineers during their product ramp-up phase to build a model of the software
system that captures their knowledge of the system and aid their mental model.
The paper also presents a learning approach in which the learners create and
refine these models iteratively using the available and newly uncovered
knowledge about the software system. We hypothesize that by leveraging this
modeling language and approach, novice engineers can reduce the time it takes
them to achieve desired proficiency level of system comprehension. This paper
presents early ideas on this language and approach.

effect of a spatially (non-)variable initial mass function (IMF) on the
determination of the mass of the putative SMBH in this galaxy. We achieve this
by performing DYNAMITE Schwarzschild orbit-superposition modelling of the
galaxy and its NSC. In order to properly take account of the stellar mass
contribution to the galaxy potential, we create mass maps using a varying
stellar mass-to-light ratio derived from single stellar population models with
fixed and with spatially varying IMFs. Using the two mass maps, we estimate
black hole masses of $(7.1^{+0.8}_{-1.1})\times 10^7\,M_{\odot}$ and
$(4.4^{+1.2}_{-2.1}) \times 10^7\,M_{\odot}$ at $3\sigma$ signifance,

black hole masses decrease by 15% and 48%, respectively. Therefore, a varying
IMF, both in its functional form and spatially across the galaxy, has a
non-negligible effect on the SMBH mass estimate. Furthermore, we find that the

well. Using the Gaia parallax and 2MASS observations, we confirmed that the
secondary is indistinguishable from an unevolved main-sequence star. The
resultant mass ratio and orbital period were the highest among SU UMa stars,
and this provided a proof that the 3:1 resonance can develop in less than 6 d
even in q=0.39(3). The superoutburst faded relatively rapidly and was followed
by a rebrightening, suggesting that the tidal effect in a large-q system was
insufficient to maintain a long superoutburst and the remnant matter caused a
rebrightening. The presence of such a system among dwarf novae is against the
conventional idea that outbursts in dwarf novae are not long enough to develop
superhumps, in contrast to novalike variables, under a weak tidal effect. The
present observation also supports that the 3:1 resonance is the cause of a long
outburst, and not its consequence, even under extreme q. The rapid growth of
the 3:1 resonance in a high-q system challenges the generally accepted results
of hydrodynamic simulations.

protoplanetary disk lifetime depends on the central stellar mass. The disk
dispersal is thought to be driven by viscous accretion, magneto-hydrodynamics
(MHD) winds, and photoevaporation by the central star. We perform a set of
one-dimensional simulations of long-term disk evolution that include all the
three processes. We vary the stellar mass in the range of 0.5-7M$_{\odot}$, and
study the mass dependence of the disk evolution. We show that a significant
fraction of the disk gas is lost by MHD winds in the early stage, but the later
disk evolution is mainly governed by photoevaporation. The disk radius
decreases as photoevaporation clears out the gas in the outer disk efficiently.
The qualitative evolutionary trends of the disk mass are remarkably similar for
the wide range of the central stellar mass we consider, and the time evolution
of the disk mass can be well fitted by a simple function. The dispersal time is
approximately ten million years for low mass stars with weak mass dependence,
but gets as short as two million years around a 7M$_{\odot}$ star. In the
latter case, a prominent inner hole is formed by the combined effect of
accretion and MHD winds within about one million years. The strength of the MHD
wind and viscous accretion controls the overall mass-loss rate, but does not
alter the dependence of the dispersal timescale on the central stellar mass.

becomes the dark matter candidate, whereas the real singlet is considered to be
even under the $Z_2$ symmetry. A dimension-5 effective term is introduced with
the help of a real singlet, which breaks the CP symmetry and gives an
additional source of CP-violation in the fermion sector. The phase transition
proceeds in two-steps, with the symmetry breaking in the singlet direction
occurring first and later leading to the usual electroweak symmetry breaking
minima, while electroweak baryogenesis is associated with the second step. The
parameters chosen for the electroweak phase transition are found to be
consistent with the Planck scale stability and the perturbativity using
two-loop $\beta$-functions. The DM mass bound for inert triplet, i.e., 1.2 TeV
(below which it is under abundance), also comes out to be consistent with the
strongly first-order phase transition, which was not possible solely with inert
triplet. The upper bound on the triplet mass comes out to be $\leq 3.8$ TeV,

with the surface as no charge transfer is observed. In the case of ZnTPP our

exhibits a severe saddle-shape deformation. From additional experiments on
NiTPP multilayer films, we conclude that this distortion is a consequence of
the interaction with the substrate, as the NiTPP macrocycle of the second layer
turns out to be flat. We further find that distortions in the MTPP macrocycle
are accompanied by an increasing energy gap between the highest occupied

relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (RBHF) theory in the full Dirac space. The
neutron and proton effective masses for symmetric nuclear matter are 0.80,
which agrees well with the empirical values. In neutron-rich matter, the
effective mass of the neutron is found larger than that of the proton, and the
neutron-proton effective mass splittings at the empirical saturation density
are predicted as $0.187\alpha$ with $\alpha$ being the isospin asymmetry
parameter. The result is compared to other ab initio calculations and is
consistent with the constraints from the nuclear reaction and structure
measurements, such as the nucleon-nucleus scattering, the giant resonances of
$^{208}$Pb, and the Hugenholtz-Van Hove theorem with systematics of nuclear
symmetry energy and its slope. The predictions of the neutron-proton effective
mass splitting from the RBHF theory in the full Dirac space might be helpful to
constrain the isovector parameters in phenomenological density functionals.

However, in a distributed setting, the mutually untrusted players are
responsible for generating the randomness themselves.
  In addition to standard desirable properties such as fairness and
Pareto-efficiency, we investigate the game-theoretic notion of maximin
security, which guarantees that an honest player following a protocol will not
be harmed even if corrupted players deviate from the protocol. Our main
contribution is an impossibility result that shows no maximin secure protocol
can achieve both fairness and ordinal efficiency. Specifically, this implies
that the well-known probabilistic serial (PS) mechanism by Bogomolnaia and
Moulin cannot be realized by any maximin secure protocol.
  On the other hand, we give a maximin secure protocol that achieves fairness
and stability (aka ex-post Pareto-efficiency). Moreover, inspired by the PS
mechanism, we show that a variant known as the OnlinePSVar (varying rates)
protocol can achieve fairness, stability and uniform dominance, which means
that an honest player is guaranteed to receive an item distribution that is at
least as good as a uniformly random item. In some sense, this is the best one

large noise variance, and some errors in the data. The combination of high
stakes classification and imperfect data is very common in practice, but it is

structure during solar minimum, where the open flux extends mainly from the
polar regions into the interplanetary space. During maximum, a complex
structure is formed with low-latitude active regions and weakened polar fields,
resulting in spread open field regions. However, the components of the solar
magnetic field that is responsible for long-term variations in the
interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) are not clear, and the IMF strength
estimated based on the solar magnetic field is known to be underestimated by a
factor of 3 to 4 against the actual in-situ observations (the open flux
problem). To this end, we decomposed the coronal magnetic field into the
components of the spherical harmonic function of degree and order $(\ell, m)$
using the potential field source surface model with synoptic maps from SDO/HMI
for 2010 to 2021. As a result, we found that the IMF rapidly increased in
December 2014 (seven months after the solar maximum), which coincided with the
increase in the equatorial dipole, $(\ell, m)=(1, \pm1)$, corresponding to the
diffusion of active regions toward the poles and in the longitudinal direction.
The IMF gradually decreased until December 2019 (solar minimum) and its
variation corresponded to that of the non-dipole component $\ell\geq2$. Our
results suggest that the understanding of the open flux problem may be improved
by focusing on the equatorial dipole and the non-dipole component and that the
influence of the polar magnetic field is less significant.

Notably, updating mesh geometry by taking gradient steps through differentiable
rendering is notoriously challenging, commonly resulting in deformed meshes
with significant artifacts. These difficulties are amplified by noisy and
inconsistent gradients from CLIP. To overcome this limitation, we opt to
represent our mesh deformation through Jacobians, which updates deformations in
a global, smooth manner (rather than locally-sub-optimal steps). Our key
observation is that Jacobians are a representation that favors smoother, large
deformations, leading to a global relation between vertices and pixels, and
avoiding localized noisy gradients. Additionally, to ensure the resulting shape
is coherent from all 3D viewpoints, we encourage the deep features computed on
the 2D encoding of the rendering to be consistent for a given vertex from all
viewpoints. We demonstrate that our method is capable of smoothly-deforming a

affective polarization. In particular, affective polarization usually
accelerates the polarization process and transform social interactions into a
zero-sum game. Yet, a wide array of existing literature have not provided valid
ways to make distinction between them. Therefore, the mechanism contributing to
the rise of affective polarization still remain unclear, as well as its unique
emergent dynamics. To address this issue, this study introduces the coupled
feedback between opinions and response susceptibility to a attraction-repulsion
model which takes account into three parameters: interaction strength, response
susceptibility and tolerance to others. The model features phase diagrams of
global consensus, affective polarization, and ``harmony with diversity"" states.
The simulations on time-varying and static social networks show that
intermediate parameter ranges yield a global convergence, as one integrated
cluster collapsing and converging towards a uncertain moderate position after
long-time persistence. Overall, the simulations reveal that the feedback
essentially offers a counterforce to establish an inversion between global
convergence and ``harmony with diversity"". Remarkably, strengthening feedback
may facilitate polarization by driving the system priorly self-organize into
one integrated cluster which then gradually approaching polarization,
especially for low tolerance and strong interactions, and the step-like dynamic
behaviors of opinion entropy suggest the occurrence of dynamic equilibrium. For

Angstrom channels, where conduction deviates from Ohm's law, as attributed to
dehydration/self-energy barrier and dissociation of Bjerrum ion-pairs in
previous work. Here we found that the cations are strongly bound to the surface
charge that blockade the ionic transport in a single-file water channel,
causing nonlinear current-voltage responses. The presence of free ions
significantly increased the probability of bound ions being released, resulting
in an ionic current. We found that ionic conduction gradually becomes Ohmic as
surface charge density increases, but the conduction amplitude decreased due to
increased friction from bound ions. We rationalized the ionic transport by 1D
Kramers' escape theory framework, which well described nonlinear ionic current,
and the impact of surface charge density on turning to Ohmic system. Our

To appear in Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics",,,,"math-ph gr-qc hep-th math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The topic of measurement in relativistic quantum field theory is addressed in
this article. Some of the long standing problems of this subject are
highlighted, including the incompatibility of an instantaneous ``collapse of
the wavefunction'' with relativity of simultaneity, and the difficulty of
maintaining causality in the rules for measurement highlighted by ``impossible
measurement'' scenarios. Thereafter, the issue is considered from the
perspective of mathematical physics. To this end, quantum field theory is
described in a model-independent, operator algebraic setting, on generic
Lorentzian spacetime manifolds. The process of measurement is modelled by a
localized dynamical coupling between a quantum field called the ``system'', and
another quantum field, called the ``probe''. The result of the dynamical
coupling is a scattering map, whereby measurements carried out on the probe can
be interpreted as measurements of induced observables on the system. The
localization of the dynamical coupling allows it to derive causal relations for
the induced observables. It will be discussed how this approach leads to the
concept of selective or non-selective system state updates conditioned on the
result of probe measurements, which in turn allows it to obtain conditional
probabilities for consecutive probe measurements consistent with relativistic
causality and general covariance, without the need for a physical collapse of
the wavefunction. In particular, the problem of impossible measurements is
resolved. Finally, there is a brief discussion of accelerated detectors and
other related work.

with fast query speed and low storage cost. Among them, deep learning-based
hashing achieves better performance on large-scale data due to its excellent
extraction and representation ability for nonlinear heterogeneous features.
However, there are still two main challenges in catastrophic forgetting when
data with new categories arrive continuously, and time-consuming for
non-continuous hashing retrieval to retrain for updating. To this end, we, in
this paper, propose a novel deep lifelong cross-modal hashing to achieve
lifelong hashing retrieval instead of re-training hash function repeatedly when
new data arrive. Specifically, we design lifelong learning strategy to update
hash functions by directly training the incremental data instead of retraining
new hash functions using all the accumulated data, which significantly reduce
training time. Then, we propose lifelong hashing loss to enable original hash
codes participate in lifelong learning but remain invariant, and further
preserve the similarity and dis-similarity among original and incremental hash
codes to maintain performance. Additionally, considering distribution
heterogeneity when new data arriving continuously, we introduce multi-label
semantic similarity to supervise hash learning, and it has been proven that the
similarity improves performance with detailed analysis. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed methods achieves comparative
performance comparing with recent state-of-the-art cross-modal hashing methods,
and it yields substantial average increments over 20\% in retrieval accuracy
and almost reduces over 80\% training time when new data arrives continuously.

relation between the normalized intensity and the width of iron lines is
investigated, in order to understand better the variation of iron lines and
possibly its connection to state transition. Considering the uncertainties due
to ionization and illuminating X-rays, only the effects of geometry and gravity
are taken into account. Three scenarios were studied, i.e., the continuous disk
model, innermost annulus model, and the cloud model. As shown by our
calculations, at given iron width, the line flux of the cloud model is smaller
than that of the continuous disk model; while for the innermost annulus model,
the width is almost unrelated with the flux. The range of the line strength
depends on both the BH spin and the inclination of the disk. We then apply to
the observation of MAXI J1631-479 by NuSTAR during its decay from the soft
state to the intermediate state. We estimated the relative line strength and
width according to the spectral fitting results by Xu et al.(2020), and then
compared with our theoretical width-flux relation. It was found that the cloud
model was more favored. We further modeled the iron line profiles, and found
that the cloud model can explain both the line profile and its variation with
reasonable parameters.

lossless compression framework with adaptive predictors for joint compression
of objects and relations in scene graph data. The proposed framework consists
of a unified prior extractor and specialized element predictors to adapt for
different data elements. Furthermore, to exploit the context information within

different graph context modeling schemes for different graph elements. Finally,
a learned distribution model is devised to predict numerical data under

results both show that AFM transition temperature is continuously suppressed
with increasing Zn content $x$ and neither long-range magnetic order nor spin
freezing is observed when $x\geq0.2$. More importantly, a linear term of the
specific heat representing fermionic excitations is captured below 5~K in the
magnetically disordered regime, as opposed to the $C_{\rm m}\propto T^3$
behavior expected for bosonic excitations in the AFM state. Based on the data

Users sequentially request video ``chunks"". The CC scheme operates above the IP

The cache placement is completely asynchronous and decentralized, and the users
are placed at random over the network coverage area. For such a system, we

injected. We find that while the QP-GP rotation parameter matches the simulated
rotation period of the star, the length scale cannot be directly connected to
the spot lifetimes on the stellar surface. Regarding the setup of the priors
for the QP-GP, we find that it can be advantageous to constrain the QP-GP
hyperparameters in different ways depending on the application and the goal of
the analysis. We find that a constraint on the length scale of the QP-GP can
lead to a significant improvement in identifying the correct rotation period of
the star, while a constraint on the rotation hyperparameter tends to lead to
improved planet detection efficiency and more accurately derived planet
parameters. Even though for most of the simulations the Bayesian evidence
performed as expected, we identified not far-fetched cases where a blind
adoption of this metric would lead to wrong conclusions. We conclude that
modeling stellar astrophysical noise by using a QP-GP considerably improves
detection efficiencies and leads to precise planet parameters. Nevertheless,
there are also cases in which the QP-GP does not perform optimally, for example
RV variations dynamically evolving on short timescales or a mixture of a very
stable activity component and random variations. Knowledge of these limitations

determined by diagonalizing the respective Hamiltonian, but the dimensions of
its matrix representation scale exponentially with the number of degrees of
freedom. Hence, only small systems that are described through simple models can
be tackled via exact diagonalization. To overcome this limitation, numerical
methods based on the renormalization group paradigm that restrict the quantum
many-body problem to a manageable subspace of the exponentially large full
Hilbert space have been put forth. A striking example is the density-matrix
renormalization group (DMRG), which has become the reference numerical method
to obtain the low-energy properties of one-dimensional quantum systems with
short-range interactions. Here, we provide a pedagogical introduction to DMRG,
presenting both its original formulation and its modern tensor-network-based
version. This colloquium sets itself apart from previous contributions in two
ways. First, didactic code implementations are provided to bridge the gap
between conceptual and practical understanding. Second, a concise and
self-contained introduction to the tensor network methods employed in the
modern version of DMRG is given, thus allowing the reader to effortlessly cross
the deep chasm between the two formulations of DMRG without having to explore
the broad literature on tensor networks. We expect this pedagogical review to
find wide readership amongst students and researchers who are taking their
first steps in numerical simulations via DMRG.

conventional parallel strategies do not fully align with modern GPU abilities,
leading to new challenges in the parallelism of VLSI simulation when using GPU,

this paper, we propose a novel approach to accelerate 4-value logic

Our approach utilizes a new strategy that can effectively handle the dependency
between tasks during the parallelism, reducing the synchronization requirement
between CPU and GPU when parallelizing the simulation on combinational

achieves one-pass parallelism. Moreover, to overcome the difficulty within the
adoption of our strategy in GPU devices, we design a series of data structures
and tune them to dynamically allocate and store new-generated output with
uncertain scale. Finally, experiments are carried out on industrial-scale
open-source benchmarks to demonstrate the performance gain of our approach

to a few millikelvin from the room temperature under the unresolved sideband
condition, where the effective mechanical temperature is a nonmonotonic
function of intracavity intensity and reaches its minimum near the turning
point of the upper stable branch. When the system is in the cryogenics

a similar feature as in the room temperature case, but the optimal cooling

reduce power consumption of this control, a giant spin Hall angle (SHA) in the
SHE is desired in low-resistivity systems for practical applications. Here,
critical spin fluctuation near the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase-transition is
proved as an effective mechanism to create an additional part of SHE, named as
fluctuation spin Hall effect (FSHE). This FSHE enhances the SHA due to the AFM
spin fluctuation between conduction electrons and local spins. We detect the
FSHE with the inverse and direct spin Hall effect (ISHE and DSHE) set-up and
their temperature (T) dependences in the Cr/MgO/Fe magnetic tunnel junctions
(MTJs). The SHA is significantly enhanced when temperature is approached to the
N\'eel temperature (T_N) and has a peak value of -0.34 at 200 K near T_N. This
value is higher than the room-temperature value by 240% and comparable to that
of heavy metals Ta and W. Furthermore, the spin Hall resistivity of Cr well
fits the modeled T-dependence when T approaches T_N from low temperatures,
implying the AFM spin fluctuation nature of strong SHA enhancement. Thus, this

increasing SHA and enriches the AFM material candidates for spin-orbitronic

hold in the hole and particle-hole sector and perform projections in these

consider typical decoherence channels (dephasing, damping, and depolarizing
noise) as well as shot noise due to a finite number of projective measurements.
We provide analytical considerations and examine numerically three example

However a complete mechanism at the origin of the outburst still remains
missing. Aims: We aim at constraining the instability mechanism in FU Orionis
star itself, by directly probing the size and the evolution in time of the
outburst region with near-infrared interferometry, and to confront it to
physical models of this region. Methods: FU Orionis has been a regular target
of near-infrared interferometry. In this paper, we analyze more than 20 years
of interferometric observations to perform a temporal monitoring of the region
of the outburst, and compare it to the spatial structure deduced from 1D MHD
simulations. Results: We measure from the interferometric observations that the
size variation of the outburst region is compatible with a constant or slightly
decreasing size over time in the H and K band. The temporal variation and the
mean sizes are consistently reproduced by our 1D MHD simulations. We find that
the most compatible scenario is a model of an outburst occurring in a
magnetically layered disk, where a Magneto-Rotational Instability (MRI) is
triggered by a Gravitational Instability (GI) at the outer edge of a dead-zone.
The scenario of a pure Thermal Instability (TI) fails to reproduce our
interferometric sizes since it can only be sustained in a very compact zone of
the disk <0.1 AU. The scenario of MRI-GI could be compatible with an external
perturbation enhancing the GI, such as tidal interactions with a stellar
companion, or a planet at the outer edge of the dead-zone. Conclusions: The
layered disk model driven by MRI turbulence is favored to interpret the spatial
structure and temporal evolution of FU Orionis outburst region. Understanding
this phase gives a crucial link between the early phase of disk evolution and
the process of planet formation in the first inner AUs.

  Multitask Learning","To appear in IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management,
  Special issue on Federated Learning for the Management of Networked Systems",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Clustered federated Multitask learning is introduced as an efficient
technique when data is unbalanced and distributed amongst clients in a
non-independent and identically distributed manner. While a similarity metric
can provide client groups with specialized models according to their data
distribution, this process can be time-consuming because the server needs to
capture all data distribution first from all clients to perform the correct
clustering. Due to resource and time constraints at the network edge, only a
fraction of devices {is} selected every round, necessitating the need for an
efficient scheduling technique to address these issues. Thus, this paper
introduces a two-phased client selection and scheduling approach to improve the
convergence speed while capturing all data distributions. This approach ensures
correct clustering and fairness between clients by leveraging bandwidth reuse
for participants spent a longer time training their models and exploiting the
heterogeneity in the devices to schedule the participants according to their
delay. The server then performs the clustering depending on predetermined
thresholds and stopping criteria. When a specified cluster approximates a
stopping point, the server employs a greedy selection for that cluster by
picking the devices with lower delay and better resources. The convergence
analysis is provided, showing the relationship between the proposed scheduling
approach and the convergence rate of the specialized models to obtain
convergence bounds under non-i.i.d. data distribution. We carry out extensive
simulations, and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms reduce
training time and improve the convergence speed while equipping every user with
a customized model tailored to its data distribution.

performance of reinforcement learning (RL) agents on the out-of-distribution
``controllable'' states. Ideally, an RL agent that generally masters a task
should reach its goal starting from any controllable state of the environment
instead of memorizing a small set of trajectories. For example, a self-driving
system should be able to take over the control from humans in the middle of
driving and must continue to drive the car safely. To practically evaluate this
type of generalization, we start the test agent from the middle of other
independently well-trained \emph{stranger} agents' trajectories. With extensive
experimental evaluation, we show the prevalence of \emph{generalization
failure} on controllable states from stranger agents. For example, in the
Humanoid environment, we observed that a well-trained Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agent, with only 3.9\% failure rate during regular testing,
failed on 81.6\% of the states generated by well-trained stranger PPO agents.
To improve ""relay generalization,"" we propose a novel method called
Self-Trajectory Augmentation (STA), which will reset the environment to the
agent's old states according to the Q function during training. After applying
STA to the Soft Actor Critic's (SAC) training procedure, we reduced the failure
rate of SAC under relay-evaluation by more than three times in most settings
without impacting agent performance and increasing the needed number of
environment interactions. Our code is available at

the number of $\mathcal{M}$-subspaces is invariant under equivalence.
Additionally, we give several generic methods of specifying permutations $\pi$

has motivated an active research towards a unified understanding of diverse
topologies of networks. Such studies have revealed that many networks with the
scale-free and fractal properties exhibit the structural multifractality, some
of which are actually bifractal. Bifractality is a particular case of the
multifractal property, where only two local fractal dimensions
$d_{\text{f}}^{\text{min}}$ and $d_{\text{f}}^{\text{max}}
(>d_{\text{f}}^{\text{min}}$) suffice to explain the structural inhomogeneity
of a network. In this work, we investigate analytically and numerically the
multifractal property of a wide range of fractal scale-free networks (FSFNs)
including deterministic hierarchical, stochastic hierarchical,
non-hierarchical, and real-world FSFNs. The results show that all these
networks possess the bifractal nature. We infer from this fact that any FSFN is
bifractal. Furthermore, we find that in the thermodynamic limit the lower local
fractal dimension $d_{\text{f}}^{\text{min}}$ describes substructures around
infinitely high-degree hub nodes and finite-degree nodes at finite distances
from these hub nodes, whereas $d_{\text{f}}^{\text{max}}$ characterizes local
fractality around finite-degree nodes infinitely far from the infinite-degree
hub nodes. Since the bifractal nature of FSFNs may strongly influence
time-dependent phenomena on FSFNs, our results will be useful for understanding
dynamics such as information diffusion and synchronization on FSFNs from a
unified perspective.

contrastive attention for separating relevant and irrelevant features via
contrastive learning and interactive attention for establishing the correlation
between both speech features in a learnable and self-adaptive manner. (2) We
propose a contrastive regularization (CR) built upon contrastive learning to
ensure that the estimated speech is pulled closer to the clean speech and
pushed far away from the noisy speech in the representation space by
integrating self-supervised models. We term the proposed SE network with CM and

in science and engineering problems. The multiple harmonic balance (MHB) method
is one of the most commonly used approaches for such problems. However, it is
limited by low-order estimations due to complex symbolic operations in
practical uses. Many variants have been developed to improve the MHB method,
among which the time domain MHB-like methods are regarded as crucial
improvements because of their high efficiency and simple derivation. But there
is still one main drawback remaining to be addressed. The time domain MHB-like
methods negatively suffer from non-physical solutions, which have been shown to
be caused by aliasing (mixtures of the high-order into the low-order
harmonics). Inspired by the collocation-based harmonic balancing framework
recently established by our group, we herein propose a reconstruction multiple
harmonic balance (RMHB) method to reconstruct the conventional MHB method using
discrete time domain collocations. Our study shows that the relation between
the MHB and time domain MHB-like methods is determined by an aliasing matrix,
which is non-zero when aliasing occurs. On this basis, a conditional
equivalence is established to form the RMHB method. Three numerical examples
demonstrate that this new method is more robust and efficient than the
state-of-the-art methods.

advanced ab initio calculations we show that undissociated screw dislocations
in cubic 3C-SiC, and their associated strain fields, could be used to create a
deterministic pattern of relevant point defects. Specifically, we present a
detailed analysis of the formation energies and electronic structure of the
divacancy in 3C-SiC when located in the vicinity of this type of dislocations.
Our results show that the divacancy is strongly attracted towards specific and
equivalent sites inside the core of the screw dislocations, and would form a
one-dimensional arrays along them. Furthermore, we show that the same strain
that attracts the divacancy allows the modulation of the position of its
electronic states and of its charge transition levels. In the case of the
neutral divacancy, we find that these modulations result in the loss of its
potential as a qubit. However, these same modulations could transform defects
with no potential as qubits when located in bulk, into promising defects when
located inside the core of the screw dislocations. Since dislocations are still
mostly perceived as harmful defects, our findings represent a technological
leap as they show that dislocations can be used as active building blocks in
future defect-based quantum computers.

decay rates of turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate are shown to
decrease with increasing Re0, while the spatial distribution of these

dissipation rate and scalar dissipation rate are calculated and are observed to
be approaching a high Reynolds number limit. By fitting an appropriate
functional form, the asymptotic value of these two quantities is estimated as
1.54 and 0.66. Finally, an evaluation of the mixing transition criterion for
unsteady flows is performed, showing that even for the highest Re0 case the

an ability to localise its source. There are, however, numerous challenges

frequencies required to capture AE activity. In just a few seconds, a recording
can generate very high volumes of data, of which a significant portion may be

controlling and processing critical information. For this reason, these devices
make use of cryptographic protocols. However, embedded devices are particularly
vulnerable to attackers seeking to hijack their operation and extract sensitive
information. Code-Reuse Attacks (CRAs) can steer the execution of a program to
malicious outcomes, leveraging existing on-board code without direct access to
the device memory. Moreover, Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs) may reveal secret
information to the attacker based on mere observation of the device. In this
paper, we are particularly concerned with thwarting CRAs and SCAs against
embedded devices, while taking into account their resource limitations.
Fine-grained code diversification can hinder CRAs by introducing uncertainty to
the binary code; while software mechanisms can thwart timing or power SCAs. The
resilience to either attack may come at the price of the overall efficiency.
Moreover, a unified approach that preserves these mitigations against both CRAs
and SCAs is not available. This is the main novelty of our approach, Secure
Diversity by Construction (SecDivCon); a combinatorial compiler-based approach
that combines software diversification against CRAs with software mitigations
against SCAs. SecDivCon restricts the performance overhead in the generated
code, offering a secure-by-design control on the performance-security
trade-off. Our experiments show that SCA-aware diversification is effective
against CRAs, while preserving SCA mitigation properties at a low, controllable
overhead. Given the combinatorial nature of our approach, SecDivCon is suitable
for small, performance-critical functions that are sensitive to SCAs. SecDivCon

network will demand efficient and noiseless frequency conversion of quantum
light. Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are a leading candidate to form
the nodes of such a network. However, the performance of a suitable converter
remains a bottleneck, with existing demonstrations severely limited by
parasitic noise arising at the target telecom wavelength. Here, we demonstrate
a new platform for efficient low-noise quantum frequency conversion based on a
monolithic bulk ppKTP cavity and show its suitability for the conversion of 637
nm single photons from NV centers in diamond to telecommunication wavelengths.
By resonantly enhancing the power of an off-the-shelf pump laser, we achieve an
internal conversion efficiency of $(72.3\pm 0.4)\%$ while generating only
$(110\pm 4) \mbox{ kHz/nm}$ noise at the target wavelength without the need for
any active stabilization. This constitutes a 5-fold improvement in noise over
existing state-of-the-art single-step converters at this wavelengths. We verify
the almost ideal preservation of non-classical correlations by converting
photons from a spontaneous parametric down-conversion source and moreover show
the preservation of time-energy entanglement via Franson interferometry.

a major challenge in the field of robotics. Recent work has shown that neural
networks trained with supervised learning can achieve real-time optimal control
in some specific scenarios. In these methods, the networks (termed G&CNets) are
trained to learn the optimal state feedback from a dataset of optimal
trajectories. An important problem with these methods is the reality gap
encountered in the sim-to-real transfer. In this work, we trained G&CNets for
energy-optimal end-to-end control on the Bebop drone and identified the
unmodeled pitch moment as the main contributor to the reality gap. To mitigate
this, we propose an adaptive control strategy that works by learning from
optimal trajectories of a system affected by constant external pitch, roll and
yaw moments. In real test flights, this model mismatch is estimated onboard and
fed to the network to obtain the optimal rpm command. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method by performing energy-optimal hover-to-hover flights
with and without moment feedback. Finally, we compare the adaptive controller
to a state-of-the-art differential-flatness-based controller in a consecutive
waypoint flight and demonstrate the advantages of our method in terms of energy
optimality and robustness.

of computing islands in current edge computing paradigms and integrate all the
resources on a network by incorporating cloud, edge, and particularly
terminal-end devices. It throws light on solving the problem of lacking
computing power. However, at this stage, due to technical limitations, it is
impossible to integrate the resources of the whole network. Thus, we create a
new meta computing architecture composed of multiple meta computers, each of
which integrates the resources in a small-scale network. To make meta computing
widely applied in society, the service quality and user experience of meta
computing cannot be ignored. Consider a meta computing system providing
services for users by scheduling meta computers, how to choose from multiple
meta computers to achieve maximum Quality-of-Experience (QoE) with limited
budgets especially when the true expected QoE of each meta computer is not
known as a priori? The existing studies, however, usually ignore the costs and
budgets and barely consider the ubiquitous law of diminishing marginal utility.
In this paper, we formulate a resource scheduling problem from the perspective
of the multi-armed bandit (MAB). To determine a scheduling strategy that can
maximize the total QoE utility under a limited budget, we propose an upper
confidence bound (UCB) based algorithm and model the utility of service by
using a concave function of total QoE to characterize the marginal utility in
the real world. We theoretically upper bound the regret of our proposed
algorithm with sublinear growth to the budget. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted, and the results indicate the correctness and effectiveness of
our algorithm.

electronic devices that channel spin-polarized currents across paramagnetic
centers. Phononic radiation have been proposed as the source of the engine's
energy, though other hypotheses, such as quantum vacuum fluctuations, should
also be examined. This paper is the first of a series which will address these
hypotheses. Herein, we investigate the more basic hypothesis that quantum
vacuum fluctuations power a quantum engine that converts entanglement energy
into useful electrical work. The system under review is composed of two
atom-level quantum dots that are tunnel-coupled and exhibit a magnetic exchange
interaction. This working substance is connected in series with two
ferromagnetic electrodes. The engine cycle comprises two strokes. The
thermalizing stroke puts the system into equilibrium with the electrode baths,
leading to a release of electrical energy into the leads and to an increase in
the system entropy due to entanglement. Then the measurement stroke breaks the
entanglement between the two quantum dots, thereby reducing its entropy while
energizing it on average. Using a perturbative master equation approach, we
analytically demonstrate the efficiency of the engine, and we study the cycle
numerically to gain insight into the relevant parameters to maximize power.
Although the possibility of harvesting energy from the quantum vacuum
fluctuations and the interactions with the baths is proven on paper and
confirmed by numerical experiments, the efficiency remains low and is unstable.
Our results indicate that quantum vacuum fluctuations alone are unlikely to be
the energy source in the the quantum spintronic engine experiments that have
been reported thus far.

  positive integrals",,,,,"math.QA math.RA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the paper Algebraic quantum groups and duality I, we consider a pairing
$(a,b)\mapsto\langle a,b\rangle$ of regular multiplier Hopf algebras $A$ and
$B$. When $A$ has integrals and when $B$ is the dual of $A$, we can describe
the duality with an element $V$ in the multiplier algebra $M(B\otimes A)$
satisfying and defined by $\langle V, a\otimes b\rangle=\langle a,b\rangle$ for
all $a,b$. Properties of the dual pair are formulated in terms of this
multiplier $V$. It acts, in a natural way, on $A\otimes A$ as the canonical map
$T$, given by $T(a\otimes a')=\Delta(a)(1\otimes a')$. In this second paper on
the subject, we assume that the pairing is coming from a multiplier Hopf
$^*$-algebra with positive integrals. In this case, the positive right integral
on $A$ can be used to construct a Hilbert space $\mathcal H$. The duality $V$
now acts as a unitary operator on the Hilbert space tensor product $\mathcal
H\otimes\mathcal H$. This eventually makes it possible to complete the
algebraic quantum group to a locally compact quantum group. The procedure to
pass from the algebraic quantum group to the operator algebraic completion has
been treated in the literature but the construction is rather involved because
of the necessary use of left Hilbert algebras. In this paper, we give a
comprehensive, yet concise and somewhat simpler approach. It should be
considered as a springboard to the more complicated theory of locally compact
quantum groups.

their surface via a process which is either thermally activated (diffusive
mode), or happens without kinetic barriers (fast crystal growth mode). It is
yet unclear what factors determine the crystal growth mode, and how to predict
it. With simulations of repulsive hard-sphere glasses, we show for the first
time that the same system at the same volume fraction and temperature can
devitrify via both modes depending on the preparation protocol of the glass. We
prepare two types of glass, a conventional glass (CG) via fast quenching and a
uniform glass (UG) via density homogenization. Firstly, we bring either glass
into contact with a crystal (X) and find the inherent structure (CGX/UGX).
During energy minimization, the crystal front grows deep into the CG interface,
while the growth is minimal for UG. When thermal noise is added, this behavior
is reflected in different crystallization dynamics. CGX exhibits a density drop
at the crystal growth front, leading to enhanced dynamics at the interface and
a fast growth mode. This mechanism may explain the faster crystal growth
observed below the glass transition experimentally. In contrast, UGX grows via
intermittent avalanche-like dynamics localized at the interface, a combination
of localized mechanical defects and the exceptional mechanical stability
imposed by the UG glass phase.

between a sheared background and the magnetic field - is commonly considered a
key ingredient for developing and sustaining turbulence in the outer envelope

instability is active and resolved, criteria originally derived in the
accretion disk literature - thus exploiting the symmetries of such systems -
are often used. In this paper we discuss the magneto-shear instability as a
truly local phenomenon, relaxing common symmetry assumptions on the background
on top of which the instability grows. This makes the discussion well-suited
for highly dynamical environments such as binary mergers. We find that -
although this is somewhat hidden in the usual derivation of the MRI dispersion
relation - the instability crucially depends on the assumed symmetries.
Relaxing the symmetry assumptions on the background we find that the role of
the magnetic field is significantly diminished, as it affects the modes' growth
but does not drive it. This suggests that we should not expect the standard
instability criteria to provide a faithful indication/diagnostic of what ""is
actually going on"" in mergers. We conclude by making contact with a suitable
filtering operation, as this is key to separating background and fluctuations
in highly dynamical systems.

to the use of probabilistic programming languages for statistical modelling and

earliest appearances of these in any nova, classical or recurrent. The
temperature of the coronal gas is $7\times10^5$ K. There is also evidence for
the presence of much cooler ($\lesssim2.5\times10^4$ K) gas. Remarkable changes

all atomic species in all frequency bins. The analytical considerations for the
FRFPMS method also explain the $1/\omega^2$-scaling of FRFPMS spectra observed
in Phys. Rev. B 104, 104301 (2021) by the use of classical statistics in the
molecular dynamics simulation. Moreover, we find that the FRFPMS method
inherently adds the contributions of phonon loss and gain within each frequency
bin. Both of these issues related to the frequency-scaling can be fixed by a
system-independent post-processing step.

a network trained by a source domain (collected at a specific hospital) does

work well by aligning the distribution of source domain and target domain. In
this paper, we propose a cluster entropy for selecting an effective whole slide

can measure how the image features of the WSI cover the entire distribution of
the target domain by calculating the entropy of each cluster and can
significantly improve the performance of domain adaptation. Our approach
achieved competitive results against the prior arts on datasets collected from

nature of which is still not clear after almost two decades of its discovery.
Here we consider that the charmed meson-(anti)meson short-range interaction is
described by the exchange of light-mesons ($\sigma$, $\rho$, $\omega$). The
effects of light-meson exchanges are recast into a simple contact-range theory
by means of a saturation procedure, resulting in a compact description of the
two-hadron interaction. From this, if the $T_{cc}^+$ were to be an isoscalar
$D^* D$ molecule, then there should exist an isoscalar $J=1$ $D^* D^*$ partner,
as constrained by heavy-quark spin symmetry. Yet, within our model, the most
attractive two charmed meson configurations are the isovector $J=0$ $D^* D^*$
molecule and its sextet $D_s^* D^*$ and $D_s^* D_s^*$ flavor partners. Finally,
we find a tension between the molecular descriptions of the $T_{cc}^+$ and that
of the $X(3872)$ and $X(3960)$, where most parameter choices suggest that if
the $T_{cc}^+$ is purely molecular then the $X(3872)$ overbinds (or conversely,
if the $X(3872)$ is a molecule the $T_{cc}^+$ does not bind). This might be
consequential for determining the nature of these states.

Specifically, we achieved CIE color coordinates of (0.677, 0.304)-close to the
ideal Schrodinger's red, with polarization independence, high reflectance
(>85%), and a large viewing angle (i.e., up to ~ 25deg). The remarkable
performance is attributed to underlying generalized multipolar interferences

that, we were able to demonstrate pixel size down to ~400 nm, corresponding to
a printing resolution of 65,000 pixels per inch. Moreover, the proposed design
model requires only ~300 iterations to effectively search a 13-dimensional

starbursts that build their stellar mass over short periods of time (>100 Myr).
These galaxies are considered to be the progenitors of massive quiescent
galaxies at intermediate redshifts ($z\sim$2) but their stellar structure and
buildup is unknown. Here, we present the first spatially resolved near-infrared
imaging of GN20, one of the most luminous dusty star-forming galaxies known to
date, observed at an epoch when the Universe was only 1.5 Gyr old. The
5.6$\mu$m image taken with the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI/JWST) shows
that GN20 is a very luminous galaxy (M$_\mathrm{1.1\mu m,AB}$=$-$25.01), with a
stellar structure composed of a conspicuous central source and an extended
envelope. The central source is an unresolved nucleus that carries 9% of the
total flux. The nucleus is co-aligned with the peak of the cold dust emission,
and offset by 3.9 kpc from the ultraviolet stellar emission. The diffuse
stellar envelope is similar in size to the clumpy CO molecular gas
distribution. The centroid of the stellar envelope is offset by 1 kpc from the
unresolved nucleus, suggesting GN20 is involved in an interaction or merger
event supported by its location as the brightest galaxy in a proto-cluster. The
stellar size of GN20 is larger by a factor of about 3-5 than known spheroids,
disks, and irregulars at $z\sim$4, while its size and low S\'ersic index are
similar to those measured in dusty, infrared luminous galaxies at $z\sim$2 of
the same mass. GN20 has all the ingredients necessary for evolving into a
massive spheroidal quiescent galaxy at intermediate $z$: it is a large,
luminous galaxy at $z$=4.05 involved in a short and massive starburst centred
in the stellar nucleus and extended over the entire galaxy, out to radii of 4
kpc, and likely induced by the interaction or merger with a member of the
proto-cluster.

mathematical structure and properties of each generative model by studying
their associated MFG's optimality condition, which is a set of coupled
forward-backward nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The theory of
MFGs, therefore, enables the study of generative models through the theory of

attempted to address the problem with machine learning and fragmentation-based
methods. However, the two approaches fail to give a satisfactory description of
long-range and many-body interactions, respectively. Inspired by
fragmentation-based methods, we propose the Long-Short-Range Message-Passing
(LSR-MP) framework as a generalization of the existing equivariant graph neural
networks (EGNNs) with the intent to incorporate long-range interactions
efficiently and effectively. We apply the LSR-MP framework to the recently
proposed ViSNet and demonstrate the state-of-the-art results with up to $40\%$
error reduction for molecules in MD22 and Chignolin datasets. Consistent
improvements to various EGNNs will also be discussed to illustrate the general
applicability and robustness of our LSR-MP framework.

learning (ML) systems. When combined with the computational complexity of
algorithms, such as neural networks, designing hardware accelerators with low
energy footprint remains challenging. Finite state automata (FSA) constitute a
type of computation model used as a low-complexity learning unit in ML systems.
The implementation of FSA consists of a number of memory states. However, FSA
can be in one of the states at a given time. It switches to another state based
on the present state and input to the FSA. Due to its natural synergy with
memory, it is a promising candidate for in-memory computing for reduced data
movement costs. This work focuses on a novel FSA implementation using resistive
RAM (ReRAM) for state storage in series with a CMOS transistor for biasing
controls. We propose using multi-level ReRAM technology capable of
transitioning between states depending on bias pulse amplitude and duration. We
use an asynchronous control circuit for writing each ReRAM-transistor cell for
the on-demand switching of the FSA. We investigate the impact of the
device-to-device and cycle-to-cycle variations on the cell and show that FSA
transitions can be seamlessly achieved without degradation of performance.
Through extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the implementation of
FSA on 1T1R ReRAM crossbar.

we propose a hybrid quantum system, consisting of a coplanar waveguide (CPW)
resonator weakly coupled to a single nitrogen-vacancy spin in diamond and a
yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) nanosphere holding Kerr magnons, to realize strong
long-distance spin-spin coupling. With a strong driving field on magnons, the
Kerr effect can squeeze magnons, and thus exponentially enhance the coupling
between the CPW resonator and the squeezed magnons, which produces two
cavity-magnon polaritons, i.e., the high-frequency polariton (HP) and
low-frequency polariton (LP). When the enhanced cavity-magnon coupling
approaches to the critical value, the spin is fully decoupled from the HP,
while the coupling between the spin and the LP is significantly improved. In
the dispersive regime, a strong spin-spin coupling is achieved with accessible
parameters, and the coupling distance can be up to $\sim$cm. Our proposal
provides a promising way to manipulate remote solid spins and perform quantum
information processing in weakly coupled hybrid systems.

resolution observations from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager onboard Solar
Orbiter with pixel scales of 210 km and 5 s cadence or better. We find 42
oscillations in 33 coronal loops with loop lengths varying between 3 to 23 Mm.
The average displacement amplitude is found to be 136 km. The oscillations
period has a range of 27 to 276 s, and the velocity amplitudes range from 2.2

active region coronal loops. The variation of loop length with the period does
not indicate a strong correlation. Coronal seismology technique indicated an
average magnetic field value of 2.1 G. We estimate the energy flux with a broad
range of 0.6-314 W m$^{-2}$. Moreover, we note that the short-period decayless
oscillations are not prevalent in the quiet Sun and coronal holes. Therefore,
our study suggests that decayless oscillations in small-scale coronal loops are
unlikely to provide enough energy to heat the quiet Sun and accelerate solar

is modelled using a grafted staircase polygon in the square lattice. The
adsorbing staircase polygon consists of a bottom and a top lattice path
(branches) and the asymptotic probability density that vertices in the lattice
are occupied by these paths is determined. This is a model consisting of two
linear polymers grafted to a hard wall in a coating. The probability that
either the bottom, or the top, path of a staircase polygon passes through a
lattice site with coordinates $(\lfloor \epsilon n \rfloor,\lfloor \delta
\sqrt{n}\rfloor)$, for $0 < \epsilon < 1$ and $\delta\geq 0$, is determined
asymptotically as $n\to\infty$. This gives the probability density of vertices
in the staircase polygon in the scaling limit (as $n\to\infty$):
  $\displaystyle {\mathbb P}_r^{f,(both)} (\epsilon,\delta) =
\frac{\delta^2(15\,\epsilon^2(1 - \epsilon)^2 - 12\, \delta^2 \epsilon(1 -

critical point (or special point), are also determined. In these cases the most
likely and mean trajectories of the paths are determined. The results show that
low density regions in the distribution induces entropic forces on test
particles which confine them next to the hard wall, or between branches of the
staircase polygon. These results give qualitative mechanisms for the

bullet cluster. In this paper, I describe ten examples of interacting clusters
identified among 200 of the most massive objects, with total masses above $1.4
\times 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$, from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation by searching
for prominent bow shocks in their temperature maps. Despite different mass
ratios of the two merging clusters, the events are remarkably similar in many
respects. In all cases, the companion cluster passed close to the main one only
once, between 0.9 and 0.3 Gyr ago, with the pericenter distance of 100-530 kpc
and a velocity of up to 3400 km s$^{-1}$. The subcluster, typically an order of
magnitude smaller in mass than the main cluster before the interaction, loses
most of its dark matter and gas in the process. The displacement between the
collisionless part of the remnant and the bow shock is such that the remnant
typically lags behind the shock or coincides with it, with a single exception
of the merger occurring with the largest velocity. Usually about 1% of the gas
cells in the merging clusters are shocked, and the median Mach numbers of these
gas cells are around two. Due to the relatively small size of the simulation
box, no close analog of the bullet cluster was found, but I identified one case
that is similar in terms of mass, velocity, and displacement. The presented
cases bear more resemblance to less extreme observed interacting clusters such
as A520 and Coma.

statistically effective and computationally efficient metric between two

The first approach is using a fixed prior distribution. The second approach is
optimizing for the best distribution which belongs to a parametric family of
distributions and can maximize the expected distance. However, both approaches
have their limitations. A fixed prior distribution is non-informative in terms
of highlighting projecting directions that can discriminate two general
probability measures. Doing optimization for the best distribution is often
expensive and unstable. Moreover, designing the parametric family of the
candidate distribution could be easily misspecified. To address the issues, we
propose to design the slicing distribution as an energy-based distribution that
is parameter-free and has the density proportional to an energy function of the
projected one-dimensional Wasserstein distance. We then derive a novel sliced
Wasserstein metric, energy-based sliced Waserstein (EBSW) distance, and
investigate its topological, statistical, and computational properties via

numerous real-world applications, particularly in healthcare. Currently, the
most common approach to survival analysis is based on Cox's partial likelihood,
which can be interpreted as a ranking model optimized on a lower bound of the
concordance index. This relation between ranking models and Cox's partial

differentiable sorting methods which relax this pairwise independence

thermal state outperforms the Gibbs state in quantum thermometry. The origin
for the enhanced precision can be sought in its asymmetry quantified by the
Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information. This additional resource is further
clarified in a fully resource-theoretic analysis, and we show that there is a

frames between existent frames. Flow-based VFI algorithms estimate intermediate
motion fields to warp the existent frames. Real-world motions' complexity and
the reference frame's absence make motion estimation challenging. Many
state-of-the-art approaches explicitly model the correlations between two
neighboring frames for more accurate motion estimation. In common approaches,
the receptive field of correlation modeling at higher resolution depends on the
motion fields estimated beforehand. Such receptive field dependency makes
common motion estimation approaches poor at coping with small and fast-moving
objects. To better model correlations and to produce more accurate motion
fields, we propose the Densely Queried Bilateral Correlation (DQBC) that gets
rid of the receptive field dependency problem and thus is more friendly to
small and fast-moving objects. The motion fields generated with the help of
DQBC are further refined and up-sampled with context features. After the motion
fields are fixed, a CNN-based SynthNet synthesizes the final interpolated
frame. Experiments show that our approach enjoys higher accuracy and less
inference time than the state-of-the-art. Source code is available at

of Jupiter and its two Trojan swarms by introducing the possible perturbations
of a free floating planet (FFP) invading the Solar System. In the framework of
the invasion of a FFP, we aim to provide some new scenarios to explain the
number asymmetry of the L4 and L5 Jupiter Trojans, and some other observed
features. We investigate two different cases: (i) The indirect case, where
Jupiter experiences a scattering encounter with the FFP and jumps outwards at a
speed that is much higher than that considered in(Li et al. 2023), resulting in
a change in the numbers of the L4 (N4) and L5 (N5) Trojans swarms. (ii) The
direct case, in which the FFP traverses the L5 region and affects the stability
of the local Trojans. In the indirect case, the outward migration of Jupiter
can be fast enough to make the L4 islands disappear temporarily, inducing a
resonant amplitude increase of the local Trojans. After the migration is over,
the L4 Trojans come back to the re-appeared and enlarged islands. As for the L5
islands, they always exist but expand even more considerably. Since the L4
swarm suffers less excitation in the resonant amplitude than the L5 swarm, more
L4 Trojans are stable and could survive to the end. In the direct case, the FFP
could deplete a considerable fraction of the L5 Trojans, while the L4 Trojans
at large distances are not affected and all of them could survive. Both the
indirect and direct cases could result in a number ratio of R45=N4/N5~1.6 that
can potentially explain the current observations. The latter has the advantage
of producing the observed resonant amplitude distribution. For achieving these
results, we propose that the FFP should have a mass of at least of a few tens
of Earth masses and its orbital inclination is allowed to be as high as 40
degrees.

paradigm shift in the second half of the 20th century with the discovery of the
possibility of chaotic dynamics in simple, physical, dynamical systems for
which the laws of evolution do not change in time. The essence of the paradigm
is the long term exponential divergence of trajectories. However, that paradigm
does not account for another type of unpredictability: the ``Black Swan"" event.
It also does not account for the fact that short-term prediction is often
possible even in systems with exponential divergence. In our framework, the
Black Swan type dynamics occurs when an underlying dynamical system suddenly
shifts between dynamics of different types. A learning and prediction system
should be capable of recognizing the shift in behavior, exemplified by
``confidence loss"". In this paradigm, the predictive power is assessed
dynamically and confidence level is used to switch between long term prediction
and local-in-time prediction. Here we explore the problem of prediction in
systems that exhibit such behavior. The mathematical underpinnings of our
theory and algorithms are based on an operator-theoretic approach in which the
dynamics of the system are embedded into an infinite-dimensional space. We
apply the algorithm to a number of case studies including prediction of
influenza cases and the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that the predictive
algorithm is robust to perturbations of the available data, induced for example
by delays in reporting or sudden increase in cases due to increase in testing
capability. This is achieved in an entirely data-driven fashion, with no

versatility, as follows: design changes on a final product are just one click
away, fabrication chains have evolved towards continuous roll-to roll

matching and overcoming most of the traditional fabrication methods.
Laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) stands out as a versatile set of

of the Wronskian of these power series is equivalent up to a polynomial factor,
to the maximum order which occurs in the linear combination of these power

polynomial blowup. We also demonstrate similar upper bounds, similar to those

methods for OTFS-NOMA, such as minimum-mean-squared error with successive
interference cancellation (MMSE-SIC), suffer from poor performance.
Additionally, existing iterative methods for single-user OTFS based on
low-complexity iterative least-squares solvers are not directly applicable to
the NOMA scenario due to the presence of multi-user interference (MUI).
Motivated by this, in this paper we propose a low-complexity method for
equalization and detection for OTFS-NOMA. The proposed method uses a novel
reliability zone (RZ) detection scheme which estimates the reliable symbols of
the users and then uses interference cancellation to remove MUI. The thresholds
for the RZ detector are optimized in a greedy manner to further improve
detection performance. In order to optimize these thresholds, we modify the
least squares with QR-factorization (LSQR) algorithm used for channel
equalization to compute the the post-equalization mean-squared error (MSE), and
track the evolution of this MSE throughout the iterative detection process.
Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed equalization and

mechanism shows that sufficient intensity of macro-level social influence can
cause a change from a continuous to discontinuous transition, further
indicating the existence of a tricritical point. Although network localization
strength determines the tricritical point, it remains unclear what network
quantities govern the performance of localization in regulating innovation
diffusion. To address this issue, we herein consider the model incorporating
both the micro- and macro-levels social influence. We present a dynamic
message-passing method to analytically treat both the outbreak threshold and
recovered population, and validate the predictions through agent-based
simulations. Extensive analysis on the classical synthetic networks shows that
sparsely available connections, and relatively heterogeneous degree
distribution, either assortative or extremely disassortative configurations are
favorable for continuous transition. In such cases, the employed network can
yield a strong localization effect so that the innovation is trapped in the
configurations composed of the hubs with high non-backtracking centrality. We
further explore the dependence of both tricritical point and localization
strength on three structural quantities: network density, heterogeneity, and
assortativity, which gives a clear physical picture of the joint effects of the
three structure quantities on the localization strength. Finally, we conclude
that the core-periphery structure, being sensitive to the change of the three
structure quantities, essentially determines localization strength, and further
regulates the phase transition.

reconstructing the complete geometrically-detailed objects from multi-views.
Most of the existing approaches only estimate the pixel-wise depth value by
minimizing the gap between the predicted point and the intersection of ray and
surface, which usually ignore the surface topology. It is essential to the
textureless regions and surface boundary that cannot be properly reconstructed.
To address this issue, we suggest to take advantage of point-to-surface
distance so that the model is able to perceive a wider range of surfaces. To
this end, we predict the distance volume from cost volume to estimate the
signed distance of points around the surface. Our proposed RA-MVSNet is
patch-awared, since the perception range is enhanced by associating
hypothetical planes with a patch of surface. Therefore, it could increase the
completion of textureless regions and reduce the outliers at the boundary.
Moreover, the mesh topologies with fine details can be generated by the
introduced distance volume. Comparing to the conventional deep learning-based
multi-view stereo methods, our proposed RA-MVSNet approach obtains more
complete reconstruction results by taking advantage of signed distance

  Strategies for Semantic Image Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and domain generalization (DG) enable
machine learning models trained on a source domain to perform well on unlabeled
or even unseen target domains. As previous UDA&DG semantic segmentation methods
are mostly based on outdated networks, we benchmark more recent architectures,
reveal the potential of Transformers, and design the DAFormer network tailored
for UDA&DG. It is enabled by three training strategies to avoid overfitting to
the source domain: While (1) Rare Class Sampling mitigates the bias toward
common source domain classes, (2) a Thing-Class ImageNet Feature Distance and
(3) a learning rate warmup promote feature transfer from ImageNet pretraining.
As UDA&DG are usually GPU memory intensive, most previous methods downscale or
crop images. However, low-resolution predictions often fail to preserve fine
details while models trained with cropped images fall short in capturing
long-range, domain-robust context information. Therefore, we propose HRDA, a
multi-resolution framework for UDA&DG, that combines the strengths of small
high-resolution crops to preserve fine segmentation details and large
low-resolution crops to capture long-range context dependencies with a learned
scale attention. DAFormer and HRDA significantly improve the state-of-the-art
UDA&DG by more than 10 mIoU on 5 different benchmarks. The implementation is

reduce the state information used for policy optimization. By providing only
relevant information, overfitting to a specific training layout is precluded
and generalization to unseen environments is improved. We formulate three CROPs
that can be applied to fully observable observation- and action-spaces and

  Endoscopic Optical Coherence Tomography",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Middle ear infection is the most prevalent inflammatory disease,
especially among the pediatric population. Current diagnostic methods are
subjective and depend on visual cues from an otoscope, which is limited for
otologists to identify pathology. To address this shortcoming, endoscopic
optical coherence tomography (OCT) provides both morphological and functional
in-vivo measurements of the middle ear. However, due to the shadow of prior
structures, interpretation of OCT images is challenging and time-consuming. To
facilitate fast diagnosis and measurement, improvement in the readability of
OCT data is achieved by merging morphological knowledge from ex-vivo middle ear
models with OCT volumetric data, so that OCT applications can be further
promoted in daily clinical settings. Methods: We propose C2P-Net: a two-staged
non-rigid registration pipeline for complete to partial point clouds, which are
sampled from ex-vivo and in-vivo OCT models, respectively. To overcome the lack
of labeled training data, a fast and effective generation pipeline in Blender3D
is designed to simulate middle ear shapes and extract in-vivo noisy and partial
point clouds. Results: We evaluate the performance of C2P-Net through
experiments on both synthetic and real OCT datasets. The results demonstrate
that C2P-Net is generalized to unseen middle ear point clouds and capable of
handling realistic noise and incompleteness in synthetic and real OCT data.
Conclusion: In this work, we aim to enable diagnosis of middle ear structures
with the assistance of OCT images. We propose C2P-Net: a two-staged non-rigid
registration pipeline for point clouds to support the interpretation of in-vivo
noisy and partial OCT images for the first time. Code is available at:

bounds on the resource consumption of the evaluation of a program. A
longstanding challenge for automatic resource analysis is the inference of
bounds that are functions of complex custom data structures. This article
builds on type-based automatic amortized resource analysis (AARA) to address
this challenge. AARA is based on the potential method of amortized analysis and
reduces bound inference to standard type inference with additional linear
constraint solving, even when deriving non-linear bounds. A key component of
AARA is resource functions that generate the space of possible bounds for
values of a given type while enjoying necessary closure properties.
  Existing work on AARA defined such functions for many data structures such as
lists of lists but the question of whether such functions exist for arbitrary
data structures remained open. This work answers this questions positively by
uniformly constructing resource polynomials for algebraic data structures
defined by regular recursive types. These functions are a generalization of all
previously proposed polynomial resource functions and can be seen as a general
notion of polynomials for values of a given recursive type. A resource type
system for FPC, a core language with recursive types, demonstrates how resource
polynomials can be integrated with AARA while preserving all benefits of past
techniques. The article also proposes the use of new techniques useful for
stating the rules of this type system and proving it sound. First, multivariate
potential annotations are stated in terms of free semimodules, substantially
abstracting details of the presentation of annotations and the proofs of their
properties. Second, a logical relation giving semantic meaning to resource
types enables a proof of soundness by a single induction on typing derivations.

pipeline that improves the quality of tabular data. Unlike traditional data
curation methods, AutoCure synthetically enhances the density of the clean data

power-flow congestions. However, such a scheme can lead to

this context, the authors' previous work proposed a robust measurement-based
control scheme accounting for the uncertainties of the estimated models. In
this scheme, a recursive least squares (RLS)-based method estimates the grid
model (in the form of voltage magnitude sensitivity coefficients). Then, a
robust control problem optimizes power set-points of distributed energy
resources (DERs) such that the nodal voltage limits are satisfied. The
estimated voltage sensitivity coefficients are used to model the nodal
voltages, and the control robustness is achieved by accounting for their
uncertainties. This work presents the first experimental validation of such a
robust model-less control scheme on a real power distribution grid. The scheme
is applied for voltage control by regulating two photovoltaic (PV) inverters
connected in a real microgrid which is a replica of the CIGRE benchmark

fine-tune these models for downstream tasks due to their high computational and

e.g., Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), have
significantly reduced the computation and storage cost by inserting lightweight
prompt modules into the pre-trained models and tuning these prompt modules with
a small number of trainable parameters, while keeping the transformer backbone
frozen. Although only a few parameters need to be adjusted, most PETuning
methods still require a significant amount of downstream task training data to
achieve good results. The performance is inadequate on low-data regimes,
especially when there are only one or two examples per class. To this end, we
first empirically identify the poor performance is mainly due to the
inappropriate way of initializing prompt modules, which has also been verified
in the pre-trained language models. Next, we propose a Pre-trained Visual

perspective. The barycenter point is introduced as the best position where to
place the negative sources. The barycenter is obtained from the spatial mean of

an expression that captures the position of the barycenter in a diffusive MC
channel with multiple FA receivers. In this work, an analytical model inspired
by Newton's law of gravitation is found to describe the barycenter, and the
result is compared with particle-based simulation (PBS) data. Since the
barycenter depends on the distance between the transmitter and receiver and the
observation time, the condition that the barycenter can be assumed to be at the
center of the receiver is discussed. This assumption simplifies further
modeling of any diffusive MC system containing multiple FA receivers. The
resulting position of the barycenter is used in channel models to calculate the
cumulative number of absorbed molecules and it has been verified with PBS data

evidence suggests that photovoltaic potential could have a maximum decrease of
$15\%$, and a maximum increase of $7\%$, primarily due to changes in solar
irradiance of different zones. Furthermore, it is observed that regions with
increased temperature also show increased solar irradiance levels, which could,
to some extent, compensate for the losses caused by the rise in temperature.

network with Long Short-Term Memory units (TCN-LSTM) is first proposed to
capture long-range dependencies in sequential data. Then, three multi-task
models (MTL-LSTM, MTL-TCN, MTL-TCN -LSTM) are developed to capture the
intrinsic relationship among output indicators. Furthermore, a unified modeling
framework for LC intention recognition and driving status prediction (LC-IR-SP)
is developed. To validate the performance of the proposed models, a total
number of 1023 vehicle trajectories is extracted from the CitySim dataset. The
Pearson coefficient is employed to determine the related indicators. The
results indicate that using150 frames as input length, the TCN-LSTM model with
96.67% accuracy outperforms TCN and LSTM models in LC intention classification
and provides more balanced results for each class. Three proposed multi-tasking
learning models provide markedly increased performance compared to
corresponding single-task models, with an average reduction of 24.24% and
22.86% in the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE),

Extensive experiments on our benchmark show that MOTOR obtains promising

derive the effective potential of the particle and the centre-of-mass (CM)
energy of the two particles outside the black hole by using the motion equation
of the particle in the equatorial plane of the black hole. We find that the CM
energy depends not only on the rotation parameter $a$, but also on the

colliding at the black hole horizon in the extreme and non-extreme cases,

angular momentum of one of the two particles is the critical angular momentum

embroil the dynamics of some regular systems into chaos. The classical and
quantum pictures are not entirely different in these broken symmetric regions.
There exists a correspondence between them, but for a brief time window.
However, our numerical observations show that quantum mechanics can emulate the
opposite role and forge exponential fluctuations in classically non-chaotic
systems within an early-time window by introducing a symmetry-breaking term to
the Hamiltonian. In this work, we have taken four one-dimensional quantum
mechanical models: two Inverted Harmonic Oscillators(IHOs), a triple Well and
IHO with a plateau. Then we spontaneously break the already existing symmetry
in their Hamiltonian with varying perturbation strength to bring anomaly into
the system. Then, we use numerical diagnostic tools such as OTOC, Loschmidt
echo and spectral form factor(SFF) to detect the anomalies that may sweep into
the system with the introduction of the asymmetry. Our primary focus is on the
behaviour of OTOC as it reduces to the Lyapunov exponent in the classical
limit, and we observe exponential growth, as expected. However, these
exponential growths of OTOC are not widespread over the entire potential well
but are limited only to the eigenstates in the neighbourhood of the broken
symmetry. These results suggest that the exponential growth of OTOC, backed by
Loschmidt echo and SFF, is due to asymmetry. In other words, OTOC detects the
effect of symmetry-breaking, which is often synonymous with the butterfly

account for this disruption, it is important to note that language learning
plays a pivotal role in developing human intelligence. Writing and computer
programming are two essential skills integral to our education systems. What
and how we write shapes our thinking and sets us on the path of self-directed

important and inseparable, in most educational settings, providing constructive
feedback on a learner's formative process is challenging. For instance, it is
straightforward in computer programming to assess whether a learner-submitted
code runs. However, evaluating the learner's creative process and providing
meaningful feedback on the process can be challenging. To address this
long-standing issue in education (and learning), this work presents a new set
of visualization tools to summarize the inherent and taught capabilities of a
learner's writing or programming process. These interactive Process

process-oriented feedback to the learners. The toolbox is ready to be tested by
educators and learners and is publicly available at www.processfeedback.org.
Focusing on providing feedback on a learner's process--from self, peers, and

surveillance and monitoring operations due to their efficiency and
maneuverability. Once a target location has been reached, drones do not have to
remain active during the mission. It is possible for the vehicle to perch and
stop its motors in such situations to conserve energy, as well as maintain a
static position in unfavorable flying conditions. In the perching target
estimation phase, the steady and accuracy of a visual camera with markers is a
significant challenge. It is rapidly detectable from afar when using a large
marker, but when the drone approaches, it quickly disappears as out of camera
view. In this paper, a vision-based target poses estimation method using
multiple markers is proposed to deal with the above-mentioned problems. First,
a perching target with a small marker inside a larger one is designed to
improve detection capability at wide and close ranges. Second, the relative
poses of the flying vehicle are calculated from detected markers using a
monocular camera. Next, a Kalman filter is applied to provide a more stable and
reliable pose estimation, especially when the measurement data is missing due
to unexpected reasons. Finally, we introduced an algorithm for merging the
poses data from multi markers. The poses are then sent to the position
controller to align the drone and the marker's center and steer it to perch on
the target. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness and
feasibility of the adopted approach. The drone can perch successfully onto the
center of the markers with the attached 25mm-diameter rounded magnet.

and other countries. It is an issue of major concern. The steep rise in the
number of automobiles on the roads followed by old infrastructure, accidents,
pedestrian traffic, and traffic rule violations all add to challenging traffic
conditions. Given these poor conditions of traffic, there is a critical need
for automatically detecting and signaling systems. There are already various
technologies that are used for traffic management and signaling systems like
video analysis, infrared sensors, and wireless sensors. The main issue with
these methods is they are very costly and high maintenance is required. In this
paper, we have proposed a three-phase system that can guide emergency vehicles
and manage traffic based on the degree of congestion. In the first phase, the
system processes the captured images and calculates the Index value which is
used to discover the degree of congestion. The Index value of a particular road
depends on its width and the length up to which the camera captures images of
that road. We have to take input for the parameters (length and width) while
setting up the system. In the second phase, the system checks whether there are
any emergency vehicles present or not in any lane. In the third phase, the
whole processing and decision-making part is performed at the edge server. The
proposed model is robust and it takes into consideration adverse weather
conditions such as hazy, foggy, and windy. It works very efficiently in low
light conditions also. The edge server is a strategically placed server that
provides us with low latency and better connectivity. Using Edge technology in
this traffic management system reduces the strain on cloud servers and the
system becomes more reliable in real-time because the latency and bandwidth get
reduced due to processing at the intermediate edge server.

often suffers from high variance. Especially when little click data is
available, this variance can cause CLTR to learn sub-optimal ranking behavior.
Consequently, existing CLTR methods bring significant risks with them, as
naively deploying their models can result in very negative user experiences. We
introduce a novel risk-aware CLTR method with theoretical guarantees for safe
deployment. We apply a novel exposure-based concept of risk regularization to
IPS estimation for LTR. Our risk regularization penalizes the mismatch between
the ranking behavior of a learned model and a given safe model. Thereby, it
ensures that learned ranking models stay close to a trusted model, when there
is high uncertainty in IPS estimation, which greatly reduces the risks during
deployment. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed
method, which is effective at avoiding initial periods of bad performance when
little data is available, while also maintaining high performance at
convergence. For the CLTR field, our novel exposure-based risk minimization
method enables practitioners to adopt CLTR methods in a safer manner that
mitigates many of the risks attached to previous methods.

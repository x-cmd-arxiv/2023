  Classification",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Solving complex classification tasks using deep neural networks typically
requires large amounts of annotated data. However, corresponding class labels
are noisy when provided by error-prone annotators, e.g., crowd workers.
Training standard deep neural networks leads to subpar performances in such
multi-annotator supervised learning settings. We address this issue by
presenting a probabilistic training framework named multi-annotator deep
learning (MaDL). A ground truth and an annotator performance model are jointly
trained in an end-to-end learning approach. The ground truth model learns to
predict instances' true class labels, while the annotator performance model
infers probabilistic estimates of annotators' performances. A modular network
architecture enables us to make varying assumptions regarding annotators'
performances, e.g., an optional class or instance dependency. Further, we learn
annotator embeddings to estimate annotators' densities within a latent space as
proxies of their potentially correlated annotations. Together with a weighted
loss function, we improve the learning from correlated annotation patterns. In
a comprehensive evaluation, we examine three research questions about
multi-annotator supervised learning. Our findings indicate MaDL's
state-of-the-art performance and robustness against many correlated, spamming
annotators.

possible to trace back the motion of stars in the vicinity of young remnants to
search for ejected companions. Establishing the fraction of remnants with an
ejected companion, and the photometric and kinematic properties of these stars,
offers unique insight into supernova progenitor systems. In this paper, we
employ binary population synthesis to produce kinematic and photometric

neutron star velocity distribution from supernovae in binaries closely traces
the input kicks. Therefore, the observed distribution of neutron star
velocities should be representative of their natal kicks. We evaluate the

that an unbound companion can be associated with a remnant. We compare our

the current sample of stars ejected by the supernova of their companion can be
increased by a factor of 5-10 with Gaia data release 3. Further progress in
this area is achievable by leveraging the absolute astrometric precision of

increased solar magnetic activity. Here, we use co-temporal, high spatial
resolution, multi-wavelength images of the Sun to investigate the underlying
causes of the non-linearity between coronal composition (FIP bias) and F10.7
solar index correlation. Using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA),
Hinode/EIS (EUV Imaging Spectrometer), and the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO),
we observed a small active region, AR 12759, throughout the solar atmosphere
from the photosphere to the corona. Results of this study show that the
magnetic field strength (flux density) in active regions plays an important
role in the variability of coronal abundances, and it is likely the main
contributing factor to this non-linearity during increased solar activity.
Coronal abundances above cool sunspots are lower than in dispersed magnetic
plage regions. Strong magnetic concentrations are associated with stronger
F10.7 cm gyroresonance emission. Considering that as the solar cycle moves from
minimum to maximum, the size of sunspots and their field strength increase with
gyroresonance component, the distinctly different tendencies of radio emission
and coronal abundances in the vicinity of sunspots is the likely cause of
saturation of Sun-as-a-star coronal abundances during solar maximum, while the
F10.7 index remains well correlated with the sunspot number and other magnetic
field proxies.

  We solve the issue by introducing the transcoding sampler, a new
stick-breaking sampler which, conditional to the exchangeable partition
posterior produced by any other sampler, enriches it with posterior samples of
the stick-breaking parameters. This new sampler is therefore able to match the
autocorrelation times of any other sampler, including marginal collapsed Gibbs
samplers; it outperforms the slice sampler and removes the need to accelerate
it with label-switching Metropolis jumps.

can infer back which specific stick in the stick-breaking construction each

reaching 13.4% of gross disposable income in early 2021 (INE, 2023). To find
similar savings figures we need to go back to 1999. With consumption reduced to
a bare minimum, the Portuguese were forced to save. Households reduced spending
more because of a lack of alternatives to consumption than for any other
reason. The relationship between consumption, savings, and income has occupied
an important role in economic thought [(Keynes, 1936; 1937); (Friedman, 1957)].
Traditionally, high levels of savings have been associated with benefits to the
economy, since financing capacity is enhanced (Singh, 2010). However, the
effects here can be twofold. On the one hand, it seems that Portugal faced the
so-called Savings Paradox (Keynes, 1936). If consumers decide to save a
considerable part of their income, there will be less demand for the goods
produced. Lower demand will lead to lower supply, production, income, and,
paradoxically, fewer savings. On the other hand, after having accumulated
savings at the peak of the pandemic, the Portuguese are now using them to carry
out postponed consumption and, hopefully, to better resist the escalating
inflation. This study aims to examine Portuguese households' savings evolution
during the most critical period of the pandemic, between March 2020 and April
2022. The methodology analyses the correlation between savings, consumption,
and GDP as well as GDP's decomposition into its various components and
concluded that these suddenly forced savings do not fit traditional economic
theories of savings.

understanding how and where MBHBs merge, measuring their redshifts,
constraining the Hubble constant and the graviton mass, and for other novel
science applications. However, due to poor GW sky localisation,
multi-wavelength, time-dependent electromagnetic (EM) models are needed to
identify the right host galaxy among many candidates. We studied merging MBHBs
embedded in a circumbinary disc using high-resolution two-dimensional
simulations, with a $\Gamma$-law equation of state, incorporating viscous
heating, shock heating, and radiative cooling. We simulate the binary from
large separation until after merger, allowing us to model the decoupling of the
binary from the circumbinary disc (CBD). We compute the EM signatures and
identify distinct features before, during, and after the merger. Our main
result is a multi-band EM signature: we find that the MBHB produces strong
thermal X-ray emission until 1-2 days prior to the merger. However, as the
binary decouples from the CBD, the X-ray-bright minidiscs rapidly shrink in
size, become disrupted, and the accretion rate drops precipitously. As a
result, the thermal X-ray luminosity drops by orders of magnitude, and the
source remains X-ray dark for several days after the merger, regardless of any
post-merger effects such as GW recoil or mass loss. Looking for the abrupt
spectral change where the thermal X-ray disappears is a tell-tale EM signature

evolution of AGN in the M-{\sigma} plane based on our gap model (Garofalo,
Evans & Sambruna 2010) for black hole accretion and jet formation illustrating
a fundamental difference between jetted and non-jetted AGN. While the latter
tend to evolve diagonally upward with black hole mass increasing along with
stellar dispersion, we show that jetted AGN tend on average to move initially
more upwards because their effect on velocity dispersion is weaker than for
non-jetted AGN. But this initial phase is followed by a shift in the nature of
the feedback, from positive to negative, a transition that is more dramatic on
average in denser cluster environments. The feedback gets its kick from tilted
jets which shut down star formation but increase velocity dispersion values. As
this change in the nature of the feedback takes tens of million to hundreds of
millions of years, jetted AGN triggered in mergers will evolve mostly upwards
for up to order 10^8 years, followed by an extremely long phase in which low
excitation progressively slows black hole growth but dramatically affects
stellar dispersion. As a result, powerful jetted AGN evolve for most of their
lives almost horizontally on the M-{\sigma} plane. The prediction is that
strongest AGN feedback on stellar dispersion is a late universe phenomenon with
M87 being a case in point. We show how jetted and non-jetted AGN parallel the

the egg serves as ground truth. The average root mean square error (RMSE) for
points and path drilling experiments are 41.7 (pm 12.2) mN and 48.3 (pm 13.7)
mN respectively.
  Conclusions: The force-sensing prototype measures forces with sub-millinewton
resolution and the results demonstrate that the calibrated force-sensing drill
generates accurate force measurements with minimal error compared to the
measured drill forces. The development of such sensing capabilities is crucial
for the safe use of robotic systems in a clinical context.

signal than the quadratic estimators (QE) can capture. We showed in a recent
work that a CMB lensing power spectrum built from a single optimized CMB
lensing mass map, working in close analogy to state-of-the-art QE techniques,
can result in an essentially optimal spectrum estimator at reasonable numerical
cost. We extend this analysis here to account for real-life non-idealities
including masking and realistic instrumental noise maps. As in the QE case, it
is necessary to include small corrections to account for the estimator response
to these anisotropies, which we demonstrate can be estimated easily from
simulations. The realization-dependent debiasing of the spectrum remains
robust, allowing unbiased recovery of the band powers even in cases where the
statistical model used for the lensing map reconstruction is grossly wrong.
This allows now robust and at the same time optimal CMB lensing constraints
from CMB data, on all scales relevant for the inference of the neutrino mass,
or other parameters of our cosmological model.

fatty plaque is built inside an artery wall. Early atherosclerotic plaque
development is typically characterised by inflammatory tissues primarily
consisting of foam cells and macrophages. We present a multiphase model that
explores early plaque growth to emphasise the role of cytokines (in particular,
Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1) and oxidised low-density lipoprotein
(oxLDL) in monocyte recruitment and foam cell production, respectively. The
plaque boundary is assumed to move at the same speed as the inflammatory
tissues close to the periphery. This study discusses oxLDL-induced toxic
environment towards macrophages and foam cells such that they start to die
beyond a threshold limit of oxLDL concentration owing to excessive consumption.
Our findings reveal that initially, the plaque evolves rapidly, and the growth
rate subsequently reduces with time because of oxLDL-induced toxicity. In
addition, it is observed that the saturation of inflammatory cell volume
fraction becomes independent of oxLDL concentration beyond the threshold limit,
referred to as the oxLDL toxicity limit. Our study manifests that a higher flux
of oxLDL leads to plaque growth decay, whereas an increase in cytokines flux is
favourable for enhanced plaque growth. Detailed analysis of the model presented
in this article unfolds critical insights into the various biochemical and
cellular mechanisms behind early plaque development.

affected by pre-eruptive activity before the onset of eruptions. During two
consecutive years before Mt. Etna's 2002/2003 flank eruption, enhanced
vegetation index (NDVI) values were detected along a distinct line which later
developed into an eruptive fissure. However, the mechanisms by which volcanic
activity can lead to changes in pre-eruption tree growth processes are still
not well understood. We analysed ${\delta}^{13}$C, ${\delta}^{18}$O and
$^{14}$C in the rings of the survived trees growing near to the line where the
pre-eruptive increase in NDVI was observed in order to evaluate whether the
uptake of water vapour or fossil volcanic CO2 could have contributed to the
enhanced NDVI. We found a dramatic decrease in ${\delta}^{18}$O in tree rings
formed before 2002/2003 in trees close to the eruption fissure, suggesting
uptake of volcanic water by trees during pre-eruptive magma degassing. Moist
conditions caused by outgassing of ascending magma may also have led to an
observed reduction in tree-ring ${\delta}^{13}$C following the eruption.
Furthermore, only ambiguous evidence for tree uptake of degassed CO2 was found.
Our results suggest that additional soil water condensed from degassed water
vapour may have promoted photosynthesis, explaining local increases in NDVI
before the 2002/2003 Mt. Etna flank eruption. Tree-ring oxygen stable isotopes
might be used as indicators of past volcanic eruptions.

in the corona. Much of this energy goes into accelerating charged particles to
high velocity. These particles travel along the magnetic field and the energy
is dissipated when the density gets high enough, primarily in the solar
chromosphere. Modelling this region is difficult because the radiation energy
balance is dominated by strong, optically thick spectral lines.
  Aims: Our aim is to provide the community with realistic simulations of a
flaring loop with an emphasis on the detailed treatment of the chromospheric
energy balance. This will enable a detailed comparison of existing and upcoming
observations with synthetic observables from the simulations, thereby
elucidating the complex interactions in a flaring chromosphere.
  Methods: We used the 1D radiation hydrodynamics code RADYN to perform
simulations of the effect of a beam of electrons injected at the apex of a
solar coronal loop. A grid of models was produced, varying the total energy
input, the steepness, and low-energy cutoff of the beam energy spectrum.
  Results: The full simulation results for a grid of models are made available

predicted [{Phys. Rev. B \textbf{105}, L180415 (2022)}]. In this effect, the
number of the excited high harmonics is found to scale up with the spin-orbit
coupling parameter, the s-d exchange constant of the magnetic system and the
frequency of the driving dynamics. Motivated by the reproduction of the
above-mentioned effect, Nikoli\'{c} and Manjarres [arXiv:2212.06895,
arXiv:2112.14685] confirmed that there is indeed a generation of harmonics as a
result of the interplay between magnetic dynamics and spin-orbit interaction if
the exchange coupling $J$ is taken very small ($J=0.1\gamma$). However, they
claim that the ultrahigh harmonics obtained in the strong $J$ limit can only be
a result of numerical bugs. It turns out that in these works, conclusions built
from numerical simulations performed in the perturbative limit
($J/\hbar\omega\approx 10$) have been applied to criticize results obtained in
the extremely high non-linear regime ($J/\hbar\omega>10^3$). Regarding this
fact, we find it necessary to shed light on many aspects related to the physics

readers of the proposed effect and at the same time the authors of the

gained popularity in recent years, as it reduces the vast data annotation cost
for training segmentation models. The typical approach for WSSS involves
training an image classification network using global average pooling (GAP) on
convolutional feature maps. This enables the estimation of object locations
based on class activation maps (CAMs), which identify the importance of image
regions. The CAMs are then used to generate pseudo-labels, in the form of
segmentation masks, to supervise a segmentation model in the absence of
pixel-level ground truth. In case of the SEAM baseline, a previous work
proposed to improve CAM learning in two ways: (1) Importance sampling, which is
a substitute for GAP, and (2) the feature similarity loss, which utilizes a
heuristic that object contours almost exclusively align with color edges in
images. In this work, we propose a different probabilistic interpretation of
CAMs for these techniques, rendering the likelihood more appropriate than the
multinomial posterior. As a result, we propose an add-on method that can boost
essentially any previous WSSS method, improving both the region similarity and
contour quality of all implemented state-of-the-art baselines. This is
demonstrated on a wide variety of baselines on the PASCAL VOC dataset.
Experiments on the MS COCO dataset show that performance gains can also be
achieved in a large-scale setting. Our code is available at

implicit approaches, a number of works have shown that explicit graphics
primitives such as point clouds can significantly reduce computational
complexity, without sacrificing the reconstructed surface quality. However,
less emphasis has been put on modeling dynamic surfaces with point primitives.
In this work, we present a dynamic point field model that combines the
representational benefits of explicit point-based graphics with implicit

Using explicit surface primitives also allows us to easily incorporate
well-established constraints such as-isometric-as-possible regularisation.
While learning this deformation model is prone to local optima when trained in
a fully unsupervised manner, we propose to additionally leverage semantic
information such as keypoint dynamics to guide the deformation learning. We
demonstrate our model with an example application of creating an expressive
animatable human avatar from a collection of 3D scans. Here, previous methods
mostly rely on variants of the linear blend skinning paradigm, which
fundamentally limits the expressivity of such models when dealing with complex

distance from Earth. Extended very-high-energy gamma-ray emission around the

water Cherenkov detector-based experiments. However, evidence for the Geminga

challenge for the background estimation in IACT data analysis. With recent
developments in understanding the complementary background estimation
techniques of water Cherenkov and atmospheric Cherenkov instruments, the
H.E.S.S. IACT array can now confirm the detection of highly extended gamma-ray
emission around the Geminga pulsar with a radius of at least 3 deg in the
energy range 0.5-40 TeV. We find no indications for statistically significant
asymmetries or energy-dependent morphology. A flux normalisation of
$(2.8\pm0.7)\times10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$TeV$^{-1}$ at 1 TeV is obtained
within a 1 deg radius region around the pulsar. To investigate the particle
transport within the halo of energetic leptons around the pulsar, we fitted an
electron diffusion model to the data. The normalisation of the diffusion
coefficient obtained of $D_0 = 7.6^{+1.5}_{-1.2} \times 10^{27}$
cm$^2$s$^{-1}$, at an electron energy of 100 TeV, is compatible with values
previously reported for the pulsar halo around Geminga, which is considerably

biomass and carbon stocks, has become critical for assessing current forest
climate benefits and projecting future benefits under various policy,
regulatory, and stewardship scenarios. Carbon accounting frameworks based
exclusively on national forest inventories are limited to broad-scale
estimates, but model-based approaches that combine these inventories with
remotely sensed data can yield contiguous fine-resolution maps of forest
biomass and carbon stocks across landscapes over time. Here we describe a
fundamental step in building a map-based stock-change framework: mapping
historical forest biomass at fine temporal and spatial resolution (annual, 30m)
across all of New York State (USA) from 1990 to 2019, using freely available
data and open-source tools.
  Using Landsat imagery, US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA)
data, and off-the-shelf LiDAR collections we developed three modeling
approaches for mapping historical forest aboveground biomass (AGB): training on
FIA plot-level AGB estimates (direct), training on LiDAR-derived AGB maps
(indirect), and an ensemble averaging predictions from the direct and indirect
models. Model prediction surfaces (maps) were tested against FIA estimates at
multiple scales. All three approaches produced viable outputs, yet tradeoffs
were evident in terms of model complexity, map accuracy, saturation, and
fine-scale pattern representation. The resulting map products can help identify
where, when, and how forest carbon stocks are changing as a result of both
anthropogenic and natural drivers alike. These products can thus serve as
inputs to a wide range of applications including stock-change assessments,
monitoring reporting and verification frameworks, and prioritizing parcels for
protection or enrollment in improved management programs.

performed well for various vision tasks such as video compression and

capacity and internal generalization for video interpolation. In this paper, we
propose a Hybrid Neural Representation for Videos (HNeRV), where a learnable

Besides the input embedding, we introduce HNeRV blocks, which ensure model
parameters are evenly distributed across the entire network, such that higher
layers (layers near the output) can have more capacity to store high-resolution
content and video details. With content-adaptive embeddings and re-designed
architecture, HNeRV outperforms implicit methods in video regression tasks for
both reconstruction quality ($+4.7$ PSNR) and convergence speed ($16\times$
faster), and shows better internal generalization. As a simple and efficient
video representation, HNeRV also shows decoding advantages for speed,
flexibility, and deployment, compared to traditional codecs~(H.264, H.265) and

the outcome of the early stages of planet formation, indicative of a picture in

this paper, we argue instead that intra-system uniformity in planet sizes and

random initial masses and compact planet spacings naturally develop
intra-system uniformity, in quantitative agreement with observations, due to

which will be shown to be intertwiners of higher-representations. This brings
into play the higher-categorical structure of higher-representations. We also

binary origins. One direct evidence to support the binary origins is to find
the surviving companions of SE SNe since previous numerical studies suggested
that the binary companion should survive the supernova impact and could be
detectable. Recently, Gagliano et al. (2022) reported that the nearby Type Ic
SN 2020oi in M100 (~17.1 Mpc) resulted from a binary system based on the HST

properties of SN 2020oi, we conduct two-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations
of supernova-companion interactions and the subsequent post-impact evolution of
the companion. Our results suggest that a surviving companion becomes brighter
in two orders of magnitude and temporarily redder after the SN impact. The
companion might be detectable with the JWST NIRCam short wavelength channel in
a few years. Furthermore, the predicted magnitudes of surviving companions show

a one-dimensional qudit chain, subject to local unitary quantum circuit
evolution in the presence of depolarizating noise at the boundary. If the qudit
chain initially contains a finite amount of locally-accessible quantum
information, unitary evolution in the presence of boundary dissipation allows
this information to remain partially protected when the dissipation is
sufficiently weak, and up to time-scales growing linearly in system size $L$.
In contrast, for strong enough dissipation, this information is completely lost
to the dissipative environment. We analytically investigate this ``quantum
coding transition"" by considering dynamics involving Haar-random, local unitary
gates, and confirm our predictions in numerical simulations of Clifford quantum
circuits. We demonstrate that scrambling the quantum information in the qudit
chain with a unitary circuit of depth $ \mathcal{O}(\log L)$ before the onset
of dissipation can perfectly protect the information until late times. The
nature of the coding transition changes when the dynamics extend for times much
longer than $L$. We further show that at weak dissipation, it is possible to
code at a finite rate, i.e. a fraction of the many-body Hilbert space of the

in the IGM during reionization. The relationship between Ly$\alpha$ velocity
offset from systemic and other galaxy properties is not well-established at
high-redshift or low luminosities, due to the difficulty of observing emission
lines which trace systemic redshift. Rest-frame optical spectroscopy with
JWST/NIRSpec has opened a new window into understanding of Ly$\alpha$ at z>3.
We present a sample of 12 UV-faint galaxies ($-20 \lesssim$ MUV $\lesssim -16$)

we analytically solve for the diffusion constant, which scales
non-monotonically with noise strength, revealing regions of enhanced and
suppressed diffusion from the interplay between onsite and bond dephasing

constant vanishes, indicating an emergent localization. On the other hand, the
operator equation becomes the diffusion equation for strong bond dephasing and
is unaffected by additional arbitrarily strong static terms that commute with
the local charge, including density-density interactions. The bound state
enters a continuum of scattering states at finite noise and vanishes. However,
the bound state reemerges at an exceptional-like point in the spectrum after

Wondrously, a virtual state constitutes the counterpart of the atomic collapse

its particle-hole symmetric, analogous to a positron state. Thus, we introduce
the effect as the adatomic collapse, which occurs due to a flat band with a
dispersionless state and a divergent density of states
$\sim|\varepsilon-\varepsilon_{F}|^{2/J-1}$ near the Fermi energy
$\varepsilon_{F}$ for $J\geq3,$ where $J\pi$ is the Berry phase. We conclude
this scenario based on the Kramers-Kronig transformation of the quasiparticle
broadening, from where we observe that the aforementioned van Hove singularity
induces virtual bound states. Counterintuitively, near the singularity, we find
these states above and below the Fermi energy correlated to the existence of
the bottom and top edges of the Coulomb insulating region, respectively. As
such a behavior rises without a twist, the system is known as Moir\'eless and
the phenomenon emerges also assisted by the adatom Coulomb correlations. Thus,
we point out that multi-graphene is a proper playground for emulating

  Example Transferability",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transferability is the property of adversarial examples to be misclassified
by other models than the surrogate model for which they were crafted. Previous
research has shown that transferability is substantially increased when the
training of the surrogate model has been early stopped. A common hypothesis to
explain this is that the later training epochs are when models learn the
non-robust features that adversarial attacks exploit. Hence, an early stopped
model is more robust (hence, a better surrogate) than fully trained models. We
demonstrate that the reasons why early stopping improves transferability lie in
the side effects it has on the learning dynamics of the model. We first show
that early stopping benefits transferability even on models learning from data
with non-robust features. We then establish links between transferability and
the exploration of the loss landscape in the parameter space, on which early
stopping has an inherent effect. More precisely, we observe that
transferability peaks when the learning rate decays, which is also the time at
which the sharpness of the loss significantly drops. This leads us to propose
RFN, a new approach for transferability that minimizes loss sharpness during
training in order to maximize transferability. We show that by searching for
large flat neighborhoods, RFN always improves over early stopping (by up to 47
points of transferability rate) and is competitive to (if not better than)
strong state-of-the-art baselines.

improved semi-supervised medical image segmentation in long-tailed scenarios by
equipping them with unsupervised contrastive criteria. However, it remains
unclear how well they will perform in the labeled portion of data where class
distribution is also highly imbalanced. In this work, we present ACTION++, an
improved contrastive learning framework with adaptive anatomical contrast for

supervised contrastive loss, where we first compute the optimal locations of
class centers uniformly distributed on the embedding space (i.e., off-line),
and then perform online contrastive matching training by encouraging different
class features to adaptively match these distinct and uniformly distributed
class centers. Moreover, we argue that blindly adopting a constant temperature
$\tau$ in the contrastive loss on long-tailed medical data is not optimal, and
propose to use a dynamic $\tau$ via a simple cosine schedule to yield better
separation between majority and minority classes. Empirically, we evaluate
ACTION++ on ACDC and LA benchmarks and show that it achieves state-of-the-art

striking feature of not transmitting any motion information. Our proposed idea
of video compression without motion coding offers a new direction for learned
video coding. Our base layer is a low-resolution image compressor that replaces
the full-resolution motion compressor. The low-resolution coded image is merged
with the warped high-resolution images to generate a high-quality image as a
conditioning signal for the enhancement-layer image coding in full resolution.
One advantage of this architecture is significantly reduced computational
complexity due to eliminating the motion information compressor. In addition,
we adopt a skip-mode coding technique to reduce the transmitted latent samples.
The rate-distortion performance of our scheme is slightly lower than that of
the state-of-the-art learned B-frame coding scheme, B-CANF, but outperforms
other learned B-frame coding schemes. However, compared to B-CANF, our scheme
saves 45% of multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) for encoding and 27% of MACs

applications. Recent studies show that modern image segmentation models are
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, while existing attack methods mainly
follow the idea of attacking image classification models. We argue that image
segmentation and classification have inherent differences, and design an attack
framework specially for image segmentation models. Our attack framework is
inspired by certified radius, which was originally used by defenders to defend
against adversarial perturbations to classification models. We are the first,
from the attacker perspective, to leverage the properties of certified radius
and propose a certified radius guided attack framework against image
segmentation models. Specifically, we first adapt randomized smoothing, the
state-of-the-art certification method for classification models, to derive the
pixel's certified radius. We then focus more on disrupting pixels with
relatively smaller certified radii and design a pixel-wise certified radius
guided loss, when plugged into any existing white-box attack, yields our
certified radius-guided white-box attack. Next, we propose the first black-box
attack to image segmentation models via bandit. We design a novel gradient
estimator, based on bandit feedback, which is query-efficient and provably
unbiased and stable. We use this gradient estimator to design a projected
bandit gradient descent (PBGD) attack, as well as a certified radius-guided
PBGD (CR-PBGD) attack. We prove our PBGD and CR-PBGD attacks can achieve
asymptotically optimal attack performance with an optimal rate. We evaluate our

Carrollian conformal algebra hints towards a co-dimension one formalism of flat
holography with the field theory residing on the null-boundary of the
asymptotically flat space-time enjoying a $1+2$D Carrollian conformal symmetry.
Motivated by this fact, we study the general symmetry properties of a
source-less $1+2$D Carrollian CFT, adopting a purely field-theoretic approach.
After deriving the position-space Ward identities, we show how the $1+3$D bulk
super-translation and the super-rotation memory effects emerge from them,
manifested by the presence of a temporal step-function factor in the same.
Temporal-Fourier transforming these memory effect equations, we directly reach
the bulk null-momentum-space leading and sub-leading soft graviton theorems.
Along the way, we construct six Carrollian fields $S^\pm_0$, $S^\pm_1$, $T$ and
$\bar{T}$ corresponding to these soft graviton fields and the Celestial
stress-tensors, purely in terms of the Carrollian stress-tensor components. The
2D Celestial shadow-relations and the null-state conditions arise as two
natural byproducts of these constructions. We then show that those six fields
consist of the modes that implement the super-rotations and a subset of the
super-translations on the quantum fields. The temporal step-function allows us
to relate the operator product expansions (OPEs) with the operator commutation
relations via a complex contour integral prescription. We deduce that not all
of those six fields can be taken together to form consistent OPEs. So choosing
$S^+_0$, $S^+_1$ and $T$ as the local fields, we form their mutual OPEs using
only the OPE-commutativity property, under two general assumptions. The
symmetry algebra manifest in these holomorphic-sector OPEs is then shown to be
$\text{Vir}\ltimes\hat{\overline{\text{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})}}$ with an abelian
ideal.

Introducing water vapour into the atmosphere, we show the runaway greenhouse
instellation limit is greatly reduced due to the presence of superadiabatic

Human errors are errors in the human thought process. To ensure software
quality, practitioners must understand how to manage these human errors.
Organizations often change the requirements engineering process to prevent
human errors from occurring or to mitigate the harm caused when those errors do
occur. While there are studies on human error management in other disciplines,
research on the prevention and mitigation of human errors in software
engineering, and requirements engineering specifically, are limited. The
software engineering studies do not provide strong results about the types of
changes that are most effective in requirements engineering. Objective: The
goal of this paper is to develop a taxonomy of human error prevention and
mitigation strategies based on data from requirements engineering
professionals. Method: We performed a qualitative analysis of two practitioner
surveys on requirements engineering practices to identify and classify
strategies for the prevention and mitigation of human errors. Results: We
organized the human error management strategies into a taxonomy based on
whether they primarily affect People, Processes, or the Environment. Inside
each high-level category, we further organized the strategies into low-level
classes. More than 50% of the reported strategies require a change in Process,
23% require a change in Environment, 21% require a change in People, with the
remaining 5% too ambiguous to classify. In addition, more than 50\% of the
strategies focus on Management activities. Conclusions: The Human Error
Management Taxonomy provides a systematic classification and organization of
strategies for prevention and mitigation of human errors in requirements

on a manual curation. AI/NLP approaches can assist expert curators in
populating these knowledge bases, but current approaches rely on extensive
training data, and are not able to populate arbitrary complex nested knowledge
schemas.
  Here we present Structured Prompt Interrogation and Recursive Extraction of
Semantics (SPIRES), a Knowledge Extraction approach that relies on the ability
of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform zero-shot learning (ZSL) and
general-purpose query answering from flexible prompts and return information
conforming to a specified schema. Given a detailed, user-defined knowledge
schema and an input text, SPIRES recursively performs prompt interrogation
against GPT-3+ to obtain a set of responses matching the provided schema.
SPIRES uses existing ontologies and vocabularies to provide identifiers for all
matched elements.
  We present examples of use of SPIRES in different domains, including
extraction of food recipes, multi-species cellular signaling pathways, disease
treatments, multi-step drug mechanisms, and chemical to disease causation
graphs. Current SPIRES accuracy is comparable to the mid-range of existing
Relation Extraction (RE) methods, but has the advantage of easy customization,
flexibility, and, crucially, the ability to perform new tasks in the absence of
any training data. This method supports a general strategy of leveraging the
language interpreting capabilities of LLMs to assemble knowledge bases,
assisting manual knowledge curation and acquisition while supporting validation
with publicly-available databases and ontologies external to the LLM.

  The development of the C++ interpreter Cling has changed the way we can think
of language bindings as it provides an incremental compilation infrastructure
available at runtime. That is, Python can interrogate C++ on demand, and
bindings can be lazily constructed at runtime. This automatic binding provision
requires no direct support from library authors and offers better performance
than alternative solutions, such as PyBind11. ROOT pioneered this approach with
PyROOT, which was later enhanced with its successor, cppyy. However, until now,
cppyy relied on the reflection layer of ROOT, which is limited in terms of
provided features and performance.
  This paper presents the next step for language interoperability with cppyy,
enabling research into uniform cross-language execution environments and
boosting optimization opportunities across language boundaries. We illustrate
the use of advanced C++ in Numba-accelerated Python through cppyy. We outline a
path forward for re-engineering parts of cppyy to use upstream LLVM components

comparison with several Unet model variants to segment 3-7 regions of interest
using only 10% of images for training per Lung-CT and Heart-CT volumetric image

segmentation recall with 4-9% improvement in Dice scores for Lung-CT stacks and
2.5-10% improvement in Dice scores for Heart-CT stacks when compared to the
Unet++ model. The NUMSnet model needs to be trained by ordered images around
the central scan of each volumetric stack. Propagation of image feature
information from the 6 nested layers of the Unet++ model are found to have
better computation and segmentation performances than propagation of all
up-sampling layers in a Unet++ model. The NUMSnet model achieves comparable
segmentation performances to existing works, while being trained on as low as
5\% of the training images. Also, transfer learning allows faster convergence
of the NUMSnet model for multi-class semantic segmentation from pathology in
Lung-CT images to cardiac segmentations in Heart-CT stacks. Thus, the proposed
model can standardize multi-class semantic segmentation on a variety of
volumetric image stacks with minimal training dataset. This can significantly
reduce the cost, time and inter-observer variabilities associated with

become affordable, automated whistle extraction algorithms were proposed to
process large volumes of recording data. Recently, a deep learning-based method
demonstrated superior performance in extracting whistles under varying noise
conditions. However, training such networks requires a large amount of
labor-intensive annotation, which is not available for many species. To
overcome this limitation, we present a framework of stage-wise generative
adversarial networks (GANs), which compile new whistle data suitable for deep
model training via three stages: generation of background noise in the
spectrogram, generation of whistle contours, and generation of whistle signals.
By separating the generation of different components in the samples, our
framework composes visually promising whistle data and labels even when few
expert annotated data are available. Regardless of the amount of
human-annotated data, the proposed data augmentation framework leads to a
consistent improvement in performance of the whistle extraction model, with a
maximum increase of 1.69 in the whistle extraction mean F1-score. Our

unprecedented pace, the aforementioned applications that potentially deployable
in space call for the understanding of thermal bubble phenomena in a
microgravity setting. In this work, we investigate the nucleation and growth of
surface bubble in space, where the gravity effect is negligible compared to the
earth. We observe much faster bubble nucleation, and the growth rate can be ~30
times higher than that on the earth. Our finite element thermofluidic
simulations show that the thermal convective flow due to gravity around the
nucleation site is the key factor that effectively dissipates the heat from
heating substrate to the bulk liquid and slows down the bubble nucleation and
growth processes. Due to the microgravity field in space, the thermal
convective flow is negligible compared to the terrestrial environment, leading
to the localization of heat around the nucleation site, and thus enables faster
bubble nucleation and growth in space. We also find that bubble nucleation can
be influenced by the characteristic length of the microstructures on the
heating surface. The microstructures behave as fins to enhance the cooling of
the surface. With finer microstructures enabling more efficient surface to
liquid heat transfer, the bubble nucleation takes longer.

extremely profitable. Rather than allow one central actor to control this
revenue source, recent research has studied mechanisms for decentralizing the
process of computing an ordering among multiple, distributed replicas. This
problem is akin to the classic problem from social choice theory of aggregating
ordinal votes, applied to a streaming setting. Prior work proposes a
``$\gamma$-batch-order-fairness'' requirement on the aggregate ordering. Under
this requirement, the ordering should be divisible into contiguous batches, and
when a $\gamma$ fraction of replicas receive $tx$ before $tx^\prime$, then
$tx^\prime$ cannot be in an earlier batch than $tx$.
  We extend this definition to formalize the notion that these batches should
have minimal size, thereby giving the first notion of order fairness that
cannot be vacuously satisfied (by arbitrarily large batches) and that can be
satisfied in the presence of faulty replicas. We then show that the Ranked
Pairs aggregation method produces an ordering that satisfies our fairness
definition for every choice of parameter $\gamma$ simultaneously and for any
number of faulty replicas (where fairness guarantees linearly degrade as the
fraction of faulty replicas increases).
  We then instantiate our protocol in the streaming setting. Careful analysis
of the interactions between ordering dependencies enables our protocol to
simulate Ranked Pairs voting in this setting, and adjustments to ordering
algorithm give a protocol that (under synchronous network assumptions) always
appends a transaction to the output ordering after a bounded amount of time.

framework that uses ""two different views"" of reference composites to

starting with a poor initial model that lacks the salt information.
Conventionally, salt bodies are included in the FWI starting model by
interpreting the salt boundaries from seismic images, which is time-consuming
and prone to error. Studies show that FWI can improve the interpreted salt
provided that the data are recorded using long offsets, and contain low
frequencies, which are not always available. Thus, we develop an approach to
invert for the salt body starting from a poor initial model, limited data
offsets, and the absence of low frequencies. We leverage deep learning to apply
multi-stage flooding and unflooding of the velocity model. Specifically, we
apply a multi-scale FWI using three frequency bandwidths. We apply a network
after each frequency scale. After the first two bandwidths, the networks are
trained to flood the salt, while the network after the last frequency bandwidth

examine six healthy volunteers using both strong and ultra-strong gradients

waveforms with different sensitivities to restricted diffusion and exchange
(150 samples), our results reveal unique time-dependence signatures in grey and

Furthermore, we show that gradient waveforms with independently varying

is pseudo-differential only at the highest order. We overcome this difficulty
noting that, by the asymptotic properties of Bessel functions, the lower order
expansion of $\mathrm{d} S \circ \mathrm{d}S^*$ is a sum of Fourier integral
operators. We then use a resolvent identity decomposition which reduces the
problem to the invertibility of $\mathrm{d} S \circ \mathrm{d} S^*$ restricted
to the subspace of functions corresponding to high Fourier modes. The inversion
of such a restricted operator is finally achieved by making the crucial
observation that lower order Fourier integral operators satisfy asymmetric tame
estimates.

propagation of atoms on lattices, to the mobility patterns of microorganisms
and earthquakes, to name a few. The dynamics of these processes is very rich
and key to understanding the complex nature of the underlying physics, but the
way in which we classify them is often too simplistic to fully reflect this
complexity. Here, we report on the experimental observation of a breakdown of
self-similar propagation for light inside a scattering medium - a transport
regime exhibiting different scaling rates for each spatial moment of the
associated probability distribution. Notably, we show that this phenomenon
arises for light waves even in the simple case of isotropic and homogeneous
disorder, and can be controlled by tuning the turbidity of the system. These
results support the idea that the traditional dichotomy between normal and
anomalous diffusion is reductive and that a richer framework should be
constructed based on the concept of self-similarity as this class of transport
regimes may be far more common that it is currently believed. In addition, this
insight can help understand scenarios where transport is dominated by rare
propagation events, as in non-linear and active media, or more generally in
other fields of research.

  Metropolis-Hastings chains","31 pages",,,,"math.PR stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To sample from a given target distribution, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
sampling relies on constructing an ergodic Markov chain with the target
distribution as its invariant measure. For any MCMC method, an important
question is how to evaluate its efficiency. One approach is to consider the
associated empirical measure and how fast it converges to the stationary
distribution of the underlying Markov process. Recently, this question has been
considered from the perspective of large deviation theory, for different types
of MCMC methods, including, e.g., non-reversible Metropolis-Hastings on a
finite state space, non-reversible Langevin samplers, the zig-zag sampler, and
parallell tempering. This approach, based on large deviations, has proven
successful in analysing existing methods and designing new, efficient ones.
However, for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm on more general state spaces,
the workhorse of MCMC sampling, the same techniques have not been available for
analysing performance, as the underlying Markov chain dynamics violate the
conditions used to prove existing large deviation results for empirical
measures of a Markov chain. This also extends to methods built on the same idea
as Metropolis-Hastings, such as the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Method or
ABC-MCMC. In this paper, we take the first steps towards such a
large-deviations based analysis of Metropolis-Hastings-like methods, by proving
a large deviation principle for the the empirical measures of
Metropolis-Hastings chains. In addition, we characterize the rate function and
its properties in terms of the acceptance- and rejection-part of the
Metropolis-Hastings dynamics.

and the requirement of synthesizing diverse motions with temporal consistency.
Previous works attempt to generate videos in arbitrary lengths either in an
autoregressive manner or regarding time as a continuous signal. However, they
struggle to synthesize detailed and diverse motions with temporal coherence and
tend to generate repetitive scenes after a few time steps. In this work, we
argue that a single time-agnostic latent vector of style-based generator is
insufficient to model various and temporally-consistent motions. Hence, we
introduce additional time-dependent motion styles to model diverse motion
patterns. In addition, a Motion Style Attention modulation mechanism, dubbed as
MoStAtt, is proposed to augment frames with vivid dynamics for each specific
scale (i.e., layer), which assigns attention score for each motion style w.r.t
deconvolution filter weights in the target synthesis layer and softly attends
different motion styles for weight modulation. Experimental results show our

liver disease. There are two main challenges in liver transplant: finding the
best matching patient for a donor and ensuring transplant equity among
different subpopulations. The current MELD scoring system evaluates a patient's
mortality risk if not receiving an organ within 90 days. However, the
donor-patient matching should also take into consideration post-transplant risk
factors, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic rejection, etc., which are all
common complications after transplant. Accurate prediction of these risk scores
remains a significant challenge. In this study, we will use predictive models
to solve the above challenge. We propose a deep learning framework model to
predict multiple risk factors after a liver transplant. By formulating it as a
multi-task learning problem, the proposed deep neural network was trained on
this data to simultaneously predict the five post-transplant risks and achieve
equally good performance by leveraging task balancing techniques. We also
propose a novel fairness achieving algorithm and to ensure prediction fairness
across different subpopulations. We used electronic health records of 160,360
liver transplant patients, including demographic information, clinical
variables, and laboratory values, collected from the liver transplant records
of the United States from 1987 to 2018. The performance of the model was
evaluated using various performance metrics such as AUROC, AURPC, and accuracy.
The results of our experiments demonstrate that the proposed multitask
prediction model achieved high accuracy and good balance in predicting all five
post-transplant risk factors, with a maximum accuracy discrepancy of only 2.7%.
The fairness-achieving algorithm significantly reduced the fairness disparity

due to their scalability and ability to work with a few face images during the
model deployment phase. However, the power of facial recognition systems
enables entities with moderate resources to canvas the Internet and build
well-performed facial recognition models without people's awareness and
consent. To prevent the face images from being misused, one straightforward
approach is to modify the raw face images before sharing them, which inevitably
destroys the semantic information, increases the difficulty of retroactivity,
and is still prone to adaptive attacks. Therefore, an auditing method that does
not interfere with the facial recognition model's utility and cannot be quickly
bypassed is urgently needed.
  In this paper, we formulate the auditing process as a user-level membership
inference problem and propose a complete toolkit FACE-AUDITOR that can
carefully choose the probing set to query the few-shot-based facial recognition
model and determine whether any of a user's face images is used in training the
model. We further propose to use the similarity scores between the original
face images as reference information to improve the auditing performance.
Extensive experiments on multiple real-world face image datasets show that
FACE-AUDITOR can achieve auditing accuracy of up to $99\%$. Finally, we show
that FACE-AUDITOR is robust in the presence of several perturbation mechanisms
to the training images or the target models. The source code of our experiments

forecast the number of strong lensed QSOs with sufficient variability to be

The damped random walk model is employed to model the variability amplitude of
lensed QSOs taken from a mock catalog by Oguri & Marshall (2010). We expect
30--40% of the mock lensed QSO sample, which corresponds to $\sim$1000, to
exhibit variability detectable with LSST. A smaller subsample of 250 lensed
QSOs will show larger variability of $>0.15$~mag for bright lensed images with
$i<21$ mag, allowing for monitoring with smaller telescopes. We discuss
systematic uncertainties in the prediction by considering alternative
prescriptions for variability and mock lens catalog with respect to our

(e.g., a patch) to activate pre-planted malicious behaviors, is a severe threat
to Deep Neural Network (DNN) models. Trigger inversion is an effective way of
identifying backdoor models and understanding embedded adversarial behaviors. A
challenge of trigger inversion is that there are many ways of constructing the
trigger. Existing methods cannot generalize to various types of triggers by
making certain assumptions or attack-specific constraints. The fundamental
reason is that existing work does not consider the trigger's design space in
their formulation of the inversion problem. This work formally defines and
analyzes the triggers injected in different spaces and the inversion problem.
Then, it proposes a unified framework to invert backdoor triggers based on the
formalization of triggers and the identified inner behaviors of backdoor models
from our analysis. Our prototype UNICORN is general and effective in inverting
backdoor triggers in DNNs. The code can be found at

illustrate a dynamic timing method that fits each observing epoch using basis
functions. By fitting each epoch separately, we allow for the evolution of the

demonstrate that it undergoes mode changing, making it the fourth millisecond

time a single mode, yields a timing solution with a root-mean-square error of
1.343 $\mu \mathrm{s}$, a factor of 1.78 improvement over template fitting on
both modes. In addition, the white-noise amplitude is reduced 4.3 times,

conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments. How to extract the effective
interaction energies between active euchromatin (A) and inactive
heterochromatin (B) directly from the experimental data, without an underlying
polymer model, is unsolved. Here, we first calculate the pairwise effective
interaction energies (A-A, B-B, or A-B) for interphase chromosomes based on
Hi-C data by using the concept of Statistical Potential (SP), which assumes
that the interaction energy between two loci is proportional to the logarithm
of the frequency with which they interact. Polymer simulations, using the
extracted interaction energy values $\textit{without any parameter}$, reproduce
the segregation between A and B type loci (compartments), and the emergence of
topologically associating domains (TADs), features that are prominent in the
Hi-C data for interphase chromosomes. Remarkably, the values of the SP
automatically satisfy the Flory-Huggins phase separation criterion for all the
chromosomes, which explains the mechanism of compartment formation in
interphase chromosomes. Strikingly, simulations using the SP that accounts for
pericentromeric constitutive heterochromatin (C-type), show hierarchical
structuring with the high density of C-type loci in the nuclear center,
followed by localization of the B type loci, with euchromatin being confined to
the nuclear periphery, which differs from the expected nuclear organization of
interphase chromosomes, but is in accord with the imaging data of the inverted
nuclei found in photoreceptor rods in nocturnal mammals. The proposed parameter
free method and applications show that compartment formation in conventional
and inverted nuclei is best explained by the inequality between the effective
interaction energies.

model is not a trivial issue since the model's one-equation nature. As a direct
analogy, the approximations could be obtained from the definition of the
Prandtl's mixing length. Moreover, this paper proposes a new algebraic
expression to approximate the intrinsic length scale of the S-A model. The
underlying transportation mechanism of S-A model are largely exploited in the
derivation of this new expression. The new proposed expression is employed in
the generation of synthetic turbulence to perform the hybrid RANS-LES
simulation of canonical wall-bounded turbulent flows. The comparisons
demonstrated the feasibility and improved performance of the new length scale
on generating synthetic turbulence at the LES inlet.

data. Yet, real-world graphs commonly exhibit diverse graph structures and
contain heterogeneous nodes and edges. Moreover, to enhance the generalization
ability of GNNs, it has become common practice to further increase the
diversity of training graph structures by incorporating graph augmentations
and/or performing large-scale pre-training on more graphs. Therefore, it
becomes essential for a GNN to simultaneously model diverse graph structures.
Yet, naively increasing the GNN model capacity will suffer from both higher
inference costs and the notorious trainability issue of GNNs. This paper
introduces the Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) idea to GNNs, aiming to enhance their
ability to accommodate the diversity of training graph structures, without
incurring computational overheads. Our new Graph Mixture of Expert (GMoE) model
enables each node in the graph to dynamically select its own optimal
\textit{information aggregation experts}. These experts are trained to model
different subgroups of graph structures in the training set. Additionally, GMoE
includes information aggregation experts with varying aggregation hop sizes,
where the experts with larger hop sizes are specialized in capturing
information over longer ranges. The effectiveness of GMoE is verified through
experimental results on a large variety of graph, node, and link prediction
tasks in the OGB benchmark. For instance, it enhances ROC-AUC by $1.81\%$ in
ogbg-molhiv and by $1.40\%$ in ogbg-molbbbp, as compared to the non-MoE
baselines. Our code is available at

one originated by a low-mass companion to the lens (planetary model) and the
other originated by a faint companion to the source (binary-source model). It
is found that the anomaly is better explained by the planetary model than the

8\times 10^{-5}$, is very small. With the constraints provided by the microlens
parallax and the lower limit on the Einstein radius, as well as the blend-flux

planet, with a mass $(4.83\pm 1.44)~M_\oplus$, orbits a low-mass host star,
with a mass $(0.18\pm 0.05)~M_\odot$, lying in the Galactic disk at a distance

homeomorphic to a symbolic dynamical system and contains its original topology.
However, this paper demonstrates an analytical mechanism by which the existence
of topological mixing and/or chaos can be shown through conjugacy with
qualitative dynamical systems outside the usual purview of symbolic dynamics.
Two examples of this mechanism are demonstrated on classic textbook models of
chaotic dynamics; the first proving the existence of topological mixing
everywhere in the dyadic map on the interval by showing that there exists a
qualitative system that is topologically conjugate to the dyadic map on the
interval with a finer topology than the usual Euclidean topology, and the other
following a similar approach to demonstrate the existence of Devaney chaos

stems from the increased workload and staff shortages prevalent in modern

each may be sent between processors in each round. The quantum versions of
these models allow the processors instead to communicate and compute with
quantum bits under the same bandwidth limitations. This leads to the following
natural research question: What problems can be solved more efficiently in
these quantum models than in the classical ones? Building on existing work, we
contribute to this question in two ways. Firstly, we present two algorithms in
the Quantum CONGEST-CLIQUE model of distributed computation that succeed with
high probability; one for producing an approximately optimal Steiner Tree, and
one for producing an exact directed minimum spanning tree, each of which uses
$\tilde{O}(n^{1/4})$ rounds of communication and $\tilde{O}(n^{9/4})$ messages,
where $n$ is the number of nodes in the network. The algorithms thus achieve a
lower asymptotic round and message complexity than any known algorithms in the
classical CONGEST-CLIQUE model. At a high level, we achieve these results by
combining classical algorithmic frameworks with quantum subroutines. An
existing framework for using distributed version of Grover's search algorithm
to accelerate triangle finding lies at the core of the asymptotic speedup.
Secondly, we carefully characterize the constants and logarithmic factors
involved in our algorithms as well as related algorithms, otherwise commonly
obscured by $\tilde{O}$ notation. The analysis shows that some improvements are
needed to render both our and existing related quantum and classical algorithms
practical, as their asymptotic speedups only help for very large values of $n$.

offloading toward the cloud will cause a large delay, vehicular edge computing
(VEC) is introduced to avoid such a problem and improve the whole system
performance, where a roadside unit (RSU) with certain computing capability is
used to process the data of vehicles as an edge entity. Owing to the privacy
and security issues, vehicles are reluctant to upload local data directly to
the RSU, and thus federated learning (FL) becomes a promising technology for
some machine learning tasks in VEC, where vehicles only need to upload the
local model hyperparameters instead of transferring their local data to the
nearby RSU. Furthermore, as vehicles have different local training time due to
various sizes of local data and their different computing capabilities,
asynchronous federated learning (AFL) is employed to facilitate the RSU to
update the global model immediately after receiving a local model to reduce the
aggregation delay. However, in AFL of VEC, different vehicles may have
different impact on the global model updating because of their various local
training delay, transmission delay and local data sizes. Also, if there are bad
nodes among the vehicles, it will affect the global aggregation quality at the

in oxygen-rich AGB stars combines an initial boost above the photosphere, given
by shock waves resulting from stellar pulsations and convective cell
granulation, with a subsequent acceleration fuelled by the radiation pressure
of the star on dust grains. We use six nearby stars, for which detailed studies
of visible and infrared observations at the VLT and millimetre observations at
ALMA are available, to assess the extent to which the validity of this picture
is currently corroborated. We show that while providing a very useful guide to
current research and having received general support and suffered no
contradiction, it still requires many additional observations to be reliably
validated. In particular, observations of the highest possible angular
resolution at both millimetre and visible/infrared wavelengths, performed in
conjunction with measurements of the light curve, are necessary to tell apart
the respective roles played by convection and stellar pulsations. A major
unanswered question is the lack of understanding of the apparent contradiction
between the observed high variability near the photosphere and the persistence
over decades, or even centuries, of the global anisotropy displayed by the CSE.
New observations of the close neighbourhood of the star are required to
elucidate the mechanism that governs rotation, in particular in the cases of R
Dor, L2 Pup and EP Aqr. We argue that the presence of stellar or planetary
companions does not seriously impact the formation of the nascent wind and only
modifies its subsequent evolution.

what metric is the best choice. Recent advances in neural tangent kernel (NTK)
theory suggest that the training dynamics of large enough neural networks is
closely related to the spectrum of the NTK. Motivated by this finding, we
propose to prune the connections that have the least influence on the spectrum

possible issue is that the fixed-weight-NTK corresponding to a given initial

Sr and Na doping, the dispersion of the L band changes, and the band gap
increases from 200 meV to 300 meV. (ii) At T=4.5 K, the Fermi energy is located
~100 meV below the edge of the L band for the Sr/Na codoped PbTe. The second
valence band at the Sigma point (Sigma band) is lower than the L band by 150
meV, which is significantly smaller than that of pristine PbTe (200 meV). The
decrease in the band offset, leading to band convergence, provides a desirable
condition for thermoelectric materials.(iii) With increasing temperature, the
carrier distribution to the Sigma band starts at T=100 K and we estimate that
about 50 percent of the total carriers are redistributed in the Sigma band at

domain in computer vision, owing to its capability to recognize objects that
have not been seen during training. Despite the significant progress achieved
by generative techniques in converting traditional GZSL to fully supervised
learning, they tend to generate a large number of synthetic features that are
often redundant, thereby increasing training time and decreasing accuracy. To
address this issue, this paper proposes a novel approach for synthetic feature
selection using reinforcement learning. In particular, we propose a
transformer-based selector that is trained through proximal policy optimization
(PPO) to select synthetic features based on the validation classification
accuracy of the seen classes, which serves as a reward. The proposed method is
model-agnostic and data-agnostic, making it applicable to both images and
videos and versatile for diverse applications. Our experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing feature-generating
methods, yielding improved overall performance on multiple benchmarks.

cross-domain tasks still present a challenge in which the model's performance
will degrade when the training set and the test set follow different
distributions. Most existing methods employ adversarial learning or instance
normalization for achieving data augmentation to solve this task. In contrast,
considering that the batch normalization (BN) layer may not be robust for
unseen domains and there exist the differences between local patches of an
image, we propose a novel method called patch-aware batch normalization (PBN).
To be specific, we first split feature maps of a batch into non-overlapping
patches along the spatial dimension, and then independently normalize each
patch to jointly optimize the shared BN parameter at each iteration. By
exploiting the differences between local patches of an image, our proposed PBN
can effectively enhance the robustness of the model's parameters. Besides,
considering the statistics from each patch may be inaccurate due to their
smaller size compared to the global feature maps, we incorporate the globally
accumulated statistics with the statistics from each batch to obtain the final
statistics for normalizing each patch. Since the proposed PBN can replace the
typical BN, it can be integrated into most existing state-of-the-art methods.
Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our PBN in
multiple computer vision tasks, including classification, object detection,
instance retrieval, and semantic segmentation.

two specially configured pretext tasks are further proposed. Pretrained on the

disturbances and interactions between parallel-connected inverters. To address
these challenges, this paper examines the transient angular stability of a
cluster of grid-following current source inverters. In a low inertia weak grid
environment, grid-following inverters may lose synchronism due to faults and
large-signal disturbances. A comparison of the voltage injection angle for
pre-fault, fault-on trajectory, and post-fault conditions is performed, and an
evaluation of the critical fault clearing time is directly related to the
uniformity of the aggregated grid-following inverters. The results show that
some inverters lose synchronism more quickly than others due to considerable
variances in line impedances and apparent power values. Additionally, inverters
with high apparent power are more susceptible to losing synchronism due to the
maximum current limit, causing the voltage at the point of common coupling to
decrease.

algorithms to surpass the classical counterparts by exploiting quantum

typical quantum algorithm that proves the superiority of quantum computing over
classical computing. It has a quadratic reduction in the query complexity of
database search, and is known to be optimal when no a priori information about
the elements of the database is provided. In this work, we consider a
probabilistic Grover's search algorithm allowing nonzero probability of failure
for a database with general a priori probability distribution of the elements,
and minimize the number of oracle calls by optimizing the initial state of the
quantum system and the reflection axis of the diffusion operator. The initial
state and the reflection axis are allowed not to coincide, and thus the quantum
search algorithm rotates the quantum system in a three-dimensional subspace
spanned by the initial state, the reflection axis and the search target state.
The number of oracle calls is minimized by a variational method, and formal
analytical results are obtained with the assumption of low failure probability.
The results show that for nonuniform a priori distribution of the oracle
elements, the number of oracle calls can be significantly reduced given a small
decrease in the success probability of the quantum search algorithm, leading to
a lower average number of oracle calls to find the solution of the search
problem. The result is applied to a simple but nontrivial database model which
has $N$ elements with nonuniform two-valued a priori probabilities to show the
effect of the optimized search algorithm. The paper is concluded with a
discussion about the generalization to higher-order results that allows a
larger failure probability for the quantum search algorithm.

  Detection",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Efficient point cloud representation is a fundamental element of Lidar-based
3D object detection. Recent grid-based detectors usually divide point clouds
into voxels or pillars and construct single-stream networks in Bird's Eye View.
However, these point cloud encoding paradigms underestimate the point
representation in the vertical direction, which cause the loss of semantic or
fine-grained information, especially for vertical sensitive objects like
pedestrian and cyclists. In this paper, we propose an explicit vertical
multi-scale representation learning framework, VPFusion, to combine the
complementary information from both voxel and pillar streams. Specifically,
VPFusion first builds upon a sparse voxel-pillar-based backbone. The backbone
divides point clouds into voxels and pillars, then encodes features with 3D and
2D sparse convolution simultaneously. Next, we introduce the Sparse Fusion
Layer (SFL), which establishes a bidirectional pathway for sparse voxel and
pillar features to enable the interaction between them. Additionally, we
present the Dense Fusion Neck (DFN) to effectively combine the dense feature
maps from voxel and pillar branches with multi-scale. Extensive experiments on
the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes Dataset demonstrate that
VPFusion surpasses the single-stream baselines by a large margin and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed.

Among them are compact binary coalescences (CBCs) that also generate

FRBs have so far been used to search for potential FRB counterparts to GWs from
CBCs. However, such methods suffer from relatively poor sky-localisation of the
GW sources, and similarly poor luminosity distance estimates of both GW and FRB
sources. The time delay between the GW and radio emission is also poorly
understood. In this work, we propose an astrophysical scenario that could
potentially provide an unambiguous association between CBCs and FRBs, if one
exists, or unambiguously rule out FRB counterparts to a given CBC GW event. We
demonstrate that, if a CBC that emitted both GWs and FRBs, is gravitationally
lensed, we can make a $> 5\sigma$ association using time-delay estimates of the
lensed GW and FRB images (in strong lensing), which are expected to be measured
with mili-second (for GW) and nano-second (FRB) precisions. We also demonstrate
that the CBC-FRB association can be made in the microlensing regime as well

Haldane flux. Without a Haldane flux, band engineering makes the band touching
points (the so-called Dirac points) move towards each other and eventually
merge into one at an intermediate $\mathbf{M}$ point in the Brillouin zone.
Here the dispersion is linear along one direction and quadratic along the
other. In the presence of a Haldane flux, the system acquires topological
properties, and finite Chern numbers can be associated with the pairs of the
conduction and the valence bands. The valence band closer to the Fermi level
($E_F$) possesses Chern numbers equal to $\pm2$ and $\pm1$, while the one
further away from $E_F$ corresponds to Chern numbers $\pm1$. The conduction
bands are associated with similar properties, except their signs are reversed.
The Chern lobes shrink in the band-engineered model, and we find evidence of
multiple topological phase transitions, where the Chern numbers discontinuously
jump from $\pm2$ to $\mp2$, $\pm1$ to $\mp1$, $\pm1$ to $0$ to $\pm2$ and
$\pm2$ to $\pm1$. These transitions are supported by the presence or absence of
the chiral edge modes in a nanoribbon bilayer geometry and the vanishing of the
plateau in the anomalous Hall conductivity. Different phases are further
computed for different hopping amplitudes across the layers, which shows the
shrinking of the Chern lobes for large interlayer tunneling.

surely this involves more than swapping DSRC V2X devices with LTE C-V2X

operations and maintenance, which is limited to funding and
designing/construction of traffic signals, but local agencies operate and
maintain signals. Hence, local agencies will work with TDOT to operate and
maintain C-V2X technology. Moreover, C-V2X technologies are not widely

transitioning to these technologies, TDOT's discussion with IOOs about the

to achieve high agility, minimal footprint, and high payload capacity while
maintaining dynamic stability. Two hardware platforms and analytical models
were developed to test design and control methodologies. The full-scale ballbot
prototype (MiaPURE) was constructed using off-the-shelf components and designed
to have agility, footprint, and balance similar to that of a walking human. The
planar inverted pendulum testbed (PIPTB) was developed as a reduced-order
testbed for quick validation of system performance. We then proposed a simple
yet robust LQR-PI controller to balance and maneuver the ballbot drivetrain
with a heavy payload. This is crucial because the drivetrain is often subject
to high stiction due to elastomeric components in the torque transmission
system. This controller was first tested in the PIPTB to compare with
traditional LQR and cascaded PI-PD controllers, and then implemented in the
ballbot drivetrain. The MiaPURE drivetrain was able to carry a payload of 60
kg, achieve a maximum speed of 2.3 m/s, and come to a stop from a speed of 1.4
m/s in 2 seconds in a selected translation direction. Finally, we demonstrated
the omnidirectional movement of the ballbot drivetrain in an indoor environment
as a payload-carrying robot and a human-riding mobility device. Our experiments
demonstrated the feasibility of using the ballbot drivetrain as a universal
mobility platform with agile movements, minimal footprint, and high payload
capacity using our proposed design and control methodologies.

a novel methodology for efficient HEA production using a low ball-to-powder

high-dimensional, strongly multi-modal parameter posterior density landscape.
Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches asymptotically recover the true posterior
but are considered prohibitively expensive for large modern architectures.
Local methods, which have emerged as a popular alternative, focus on specific
parameter regions that can be approximated by functions with tractable
integrals. While these often yield satisfactory empirical results, they fail,
by definition, to account for the multi-modality of the parameter posterior. In
this work, we argue that the dilemma between exact-but-unaffordable and
cheap-but-inexact approaches can be mitigated by exploiting symmetries in the
posterior landscape. Such symmetries, induced by neuron interchangeability and
certain activation functions, manifest in different parameter values leading to
the same functional output value. We show theoretically that the posterior
predictive density in Bayesian neural networks can be restricted to a
symmetry-free parameter reference set. By further deriving an upper bound on
the number of Monte Carlo chains required to capture the functional diversity,
we propose a straightforward approach for feasible Bayesian inference. Our

To contribute to a solution, we report on the ferroelectric switching

Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si and epitaxial Pt/GaN/sapphire templates by sputter-deposition. In
this context, we focus on the following major achievements compared to
previously available wurtzite-type ferroelectrics: 1) Record low switching
voltages down to 1 V are achieved, which is in a range that can be supplied by
standard on-chip voltage sources. 2) Compared to the previously investigated
deposition of thinnest Al$_{1-x}$Sc$_x$N films on epitaxial templates, a
significantly larger coercive field to breakdown field ratio is observed for
Al$_{0.74}$Sc$_{0.26}$N films grown on silicon substrates, the technologically
most relevant substrate-type. 3) The formation of true ferroelectric domains in
wurtzite-type materials is for the first time demonstrated on the atomic scale
by scanning transmission electron microscopy investigations of a sub-5 nm thin
partially switched film. The direct observation of inversion domain boundaries
within single nm-sized grains supports the theory of a gradual domain-wall
motion limited switching process in wurtzite-type ferroelectrics. Ultimately,
this should enable the analog switching necessary for mimicking neuromorphic
concepts also in highly scaled devices.

generalization capabilities of deep neural networks presents a formidable
challenge. Recent insights from random matrix theory, specifically those
concerning the spectral analysis of weight matrices in deep neural networks,
offer valuable clues to address this issue. A key finding indicates that the
generalization performance of a neural network is associated with the degree of
heavy tails in the spectrum of its weight matrices. To capitalize on this
discovery, we introduce a novel regularization technique, termed Heavy-Tailed
Regularization, which explicitly promotes a more heavy-tailed spectrum in the
weight matrix through regularization. Firstly, we employ the Weighted Alpha and
Stable Rank as penalty terms, both of which are differentiable, enabling the
direct calculation of their gradients. To circumvent over-regularization, we
introduce two variations of the penalty function. Then, adopting a Bayesian
statistics perspective and leveraging knowledge from random matrices, we
develop two novel heavy-tailed regularization methods, utilizing Powerlaw
distribution and Frechet distribution as priors for the global spectrum and
maximum eigenvalues, respectively. We empirically show that heavytailed
regularization outperforms conventional regularization techniques in terms of
generalization performance.

spatiotemporal organization of red blood cells (RBCs) causing various
physiological complications. In lab-on-a-chip applications, constrictions are
commonly used for cell sorting and plasma separation based on the formation of
a cell-free layer (CFL) at the channel boundary. However, such devices usually
employ a steady flow, although time-dependent and pulsatile flow conditions
enhance many microfluidic operations and possess significant relevance for
in-vitro studies under physiologically relevant flow conditions. In this study,
we examine the CFL dynamics in a constricted microchannel under steady and
time-dependent flow. Therefore, we develop an image processing routine that
allows us to resolve the spatiotemporal evolution of the CFL under
time-dependent driving of the flow with arbitrary waveform. First, we perform a
characterization of the CFL and the cell-free area (CFA) before and after the
constriction under steady flow conditions. Second, we employ our method to
study the effect of the hematocrit and the parameters of the flow modulations
on the CFL and CFA using a sinusoidal pressure profile. Our results highlight
the dominant effects of the RBC concentration and the amplitude of the applied
pressure signal predominantly on the CFA dynamics. Moreover, we observe a
dampening of the CFA amplitude with increasing hematocrit or decreasing
pressure amplitude, and a peculiar phase shift of the CFA oscillations pre- and
post-constriction. Complementary numerical simulations reveal how the
time-dependent CFA dynamics are coupled with the dynamically changing flow
field at the constriction. Due to the increasing demand for investigations and
applications under time-dependent flow conditions, our study provides crucial
insight into the flow behavior of complex fluids in unsteady microscale flows.

cambered airfoil at a high Reynolds number (3.6 10^6), which is of direct
relevance for wind turbine design. Unlike thin airfoils at low chord-based
Reynolds numbers, no consistent description currently exists for the stall
process on such airfoils. As an attempt to shed some light on the flow physics,
we consider two chord-wise rows of instantaneous wall pressure measurements,
taken simultaneously at two spanwise locations over a range of angles of
attack. We show that the pressure fluctuations are largest for maximum lift
conditions, and that a fluctuation peak along the chord is systematically
located directly upstream of the mean steady separation point, indicating an
intermittent flow separation. For angles of attack corresponding to the onset
of separation, the pressure fluctuations are characterized by bi-stability in
both space and time: for each spanwise location, large excursions of the local
wall pressure between two different levels can be observed in time (jumps), and
these excursions are highly anti-correlated between the two spanwise locations
(spatial switches). The characteristic time scale for the switches is found to
be well correlated with the pressure variance. Application of Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD) analysis to each row of sensors confirms that the flow
separation is an inherently local, three-dimensional and unsteady process that
occurs in a continuous manner when the angle of attack increases. The
correlation between the dominant POD mode amplitudes is found to be a good
indicator of bi-stability. Moreover, most of the fluctuations can be captured
with the two most energetic POD modes. This suggests that force fluctuations
near the maximal lift could be modelled by a low-order approach, for monitoring
and control purposes.

  Graph Embedding","Accepted in the ACM Web Conference (WWW 2023)",,,,"cs.CR cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is a fundamental technique that extracts
expressive representation from knowledge graph (KG) to facilitate diverse
downstream tasks. The emerging federated KGE (FKGE) collaboratively trains from
distributed KGs held among clients while avoiding exchanging clients' sensitive
raw KGs, which can still suffer from privacy threats as evidenced in other
federated model trainings (e.g., neural networks). However, quantifying and
defending against such privacy threats remain unexplored for FKGE which
possesses unique properties not shared by previously studied models. In this
paper, we conduct the first holistic study of the privacy threat on FKGE from
both attack and defense perspectives. For the attack, we quantify the privacy
threat by proposing three new inference attacks, which reveal substantial
privacy risk by successfully inferring the existence of the KG triple from
victim clients. For the defense, we propose DP-Flames, a novel differentially
private FKGE with private selection, which offers a better privacy-utility
tradeoff by exploiting the entity-binding sparse gradient property of FKGE and
comes with a tight privacy accountant by incorporating the state-of-the-art
private selection technique. We further propose an adaptive privacy budget
allocation policy to dynamically adjust defense magnitude across the training
procedure. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed defense can
successfully mitigate the privacy threat by effectively reducing the success
rate of inference attacks from $83.1\%$ to $59.4\%$ on average with only a
modest utility decrease.

the definition of the start and end of events is subjective, which may confuse
the model. To alleviate the boundary ambiguity, we propose to study the video
activity localization problem from a denoising perspective. Specifically, we
propose an encoder-decoder model named DenoiseLoc. During training, a set of
action spans is randomly generated from the ground truth with a controlled
noise scale. Then we attempt to reverse this process by boundary denoising,
allowing the localizer to predict activities with precise boundaries and
resulting in faster convergence speed. Experiments show that DenoiseLoc
advances %in several video activity understanding tasks. For example, we
observe a gain of +12.36% average mAP on QV-Highlights dataset and +1.64%

physicalization of potato-shaped organic models in a puzzle fashion. The
algorithm begins with creating a simple, regular triangular surface mesh of
organic shapes, followed by iterative k-means clustering and remeshing. For
clustering, we need similarity between triangles (segments) which is defined as
a distance function. The distance function maps each triangle's shape to a
single point in the virtual 3D space. Thus, the distance between the triangles
indicates their degree of dissimilarity. K-means clustering uses this distance
and sorts of segments into k classes. After this, remeshing is applied to
minimize the distance between triangles within the same cluster by making their
shapes identical. Clustering and remeshing are repeated until the distance
between triangles in the same cluster reaches an acceptable threshold. We adopt
a curvature-aware strategy to determine the surface thickness and finalize
puzzle pieces for 3D printing. Identical hinges and holes are created for
assembling the puzzle components. For smoother outcomes, we use triangle
subdivision along with curvature-aware clustering, generating curved triangular
patches for 3D printing. Our algorithm was evaluated using various models, and
the 3D-printed results were analyzed. Findings indicate that our algorithm
performs reliably on target organic shapes with minimal loss of input geometry.

pixel-level annotation for segmentation tasks. However, the existing
interactive segmentation pipeline suffers from inefficient computations of
interactive models because of the following two issues. First, annotators'
later click is based on models' feedback of annotators' former click. This
serial interaction is unable to utilize model's parallelism capabilities.
Second, the model has to repeatedly process the image, the annotator's current
click, and the model's feedback of the annotator's former clicks at each step
of interaction, resulting in redundant computations. For efficient computation,
we propose a method named InterFormer that follows a new pipeline to address
these issues. InterFormer extracts and preprocesses the computationally
time-consuming part i.e. image processing from the existing process.
Specifically, InterFormer employs a large vision transformer (ViT) on
high-performance devices to preprocess images in parallel, and then uses a
lightweight module called interactive multi-head self attention (I-MSA) for
interactive segmentation. Furthermore, the I-MSA module's deployment on
low-power devices extends the practical application of interactive
segmentation. The I-MSA module utilizes the preprocessed features to
efficiently response to the annotator inputs in real-time. The experiments on
several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of InterFormer, which
outperforms previous interactive segmentation models in terms of computational
efficiency and segmentation quality, achieve real-time high-quality interactive

answers were manually classified as specified in the coding manual. Most of the
effort to automate coding has gone into the easier problem of single label

text answers to open-ended survey questions in social science surveys. We
evaluate the performance of the transformer-based architecture BERT for the
German language in comparison to traditional multi-label algorithms (Binary
Relevance, Label Powerset, ECC) in a German social science survey, the GLES
Panel (N=17,584, 55 labels). We find that classification with BERT (forcing at
least one label) has the smallest 0/1 loss (13.1%) among methods considered
(18.9%-21.6%). As expected, it is much easier to correctly predict answer texts
that correspond to a single label (7.1% loss) than those that correspond to
multiple labels ($\sim$50% loss). Because BERT predicts zero labels for only
1.5% of the answers, forcing at least one label, while recommended, ultimately
does not lower the 0/1 loss by much. Our work has important implications for
social scientists: 1) We have shown multi-label classification with BERT works
in the German language for open-ends. 2) For mildly multi-label classification
tasks, the loss now appears small enough to allow for fully automatic
classification (as compared to semi-automatic approaches). 3) Multi-label

Briefly, there is a stable de Sitter solution which appears as either a point

causal mechanisms, we find that previous methods ignore the implicit
insignificant non-causal factors hidden in the common features. This is mainly
due to the single-view nature of DAL. In this work, we present an idea to
remove non-causal factors from common features by multi-view adversarial

non-causal factors may still be significant in other latent spaces (views) due
to the multi-mode structure of data. To summarize, we propose a Multi-view

of a Spurious Correlations Generator (SCG) that increases the diversity of
source domain by random augmentation and a Multi-View Domain Classifier (MVDC)
that maps features to multiple latent spaces, such that the non-causal factors
are removed and the domain-invariant features are purified. Extensive
experiments on six benchmarks show our MAD obtains state-of-the-art

Given these potential harms, we conduct a risk assessment and quasi-experiment
on the game features of location-based games. Using PokemonGO as a case study,
we identify and establish cyber-enabled stalking as the main risk event where
in-game features such as an innocent function to share in-game postcards can be
exploited by malicious users. Users obtain postcards that are unique to each
Pokestop and represent gifts that can be shared with in-game friends. The
number of postcards that each user can retain is limited, so they send the
excess to their friends with items that boost their friends' game activities.
The postcard often also unintentionally leaks the users' commonly visited
locations to their in-game friends. We analyze these in-game features using
risk assessment and identify cyber-enabled stalking as one of the main threats.
We further evaluate the feasibility of this crime through a quasi-experiment.
Our results show that participants' routine locations such as home and work can
be reliably re-identified within days from the first gift exchange. This
exploitation of a previously unconsidered in-game feature enables physical
stalking of previously unknown persons which can escalate into more serious
crimes. Given current data protection legislation in Europe, further preventive

support longer inspections and carry a higher number of sensors on board.
However, their capabilities are limited by the mobility of wheeled and legged
robots in a cluttered environment.
  In this paper, we propose a novel concept for autonomous inspection that we
call SwarmGear. SwarmGear utilizes a heterogeneous swarm that investigates the
environment in a leader-follower formation. The leader drone is able to land on
rough terrain and traverse it by four compliant robotic legs, possessing both
the functionalities of an aerial and mobile robot. To preserve the formation of
the swarm during its motion, virtual impedance links were developed between the
leader and the follower drones.
  We evaluated experimentally the accuracy of the hybrid leader drone's ground
locomotion. By changing the step parameters, the optimal step configuration was
found. Two types of gaits were evaluated. The experiments revealed low
crosstrack error (mean of 2 cm and max of 4.8 cm) and the ability of the leader
drone to move with a 190 mm step length and a 3 degree standard yaw deviation.
Four types of drone formations were considered. The best formation was used for
experiments with SwarmGear, and it showed low overall crosstrack error for the
swarm (mean 7.9 cm for the type 1 gait and 5.1 cm for the type 2 gait).
  The proposed system can potentially improve the performance of autonomous
swarms in cluttered and unstructured environments by allowing all agents of the
swarm to switch between aerial and ground formations to overcome various
obstacles and perform missions over a large area.

adding power law prior to node embedding initialization; then, it aggregates
neighbors directly in multiple hyperbolic spaces through the gyromidpoint
method to obtain more accurate computation results; finally, the gate fusion
with prior is used to fuse multiple embeddings of one node from different

that our model is highly competitive and outperforms leading baselines,

stochastic quantum trajectories of pure states. Instead, the ensemble average
over trajectories is a mixed state evolving via a master equation. Both
descriptions lead to the same expectation values for linear observables.
Recently, there is growing interest in the average entanglement appearing
during quantum trajectories. The entanglement is a nonlinear observable that is
sensitive to so-called measurement-induced phase transitions, namely,
transitions from a critical and system-size dependent phase to a quantum Zeno
phase with area-law entanglement. Intriguingly, the mixed steady-state
description of these systems is insensitive to this phase transition. Together
with the difficulty of quantifying the mixed state entanglement, this favors
quantum trajectories for the description of the quantum measurement process.
Here, we study the entanglement of a single particle under continuous
measurements (using the newly developed configuration coherence) in both the
mixed state and the quantum trajectories descriptions. In both descriptions, we
find that the entanglement at intermediate time scales shows the same
qualitative behavior as a function of the measurement strength. This
demonstrates that the mixed-state description allows for the observation of
quantum-to-classical measurement-induced effects.

transfer and extend concepts for conformation transitions in stochastic

segmenting the corresponding sounding object based on audio-visual queries.
Successful audio-visual learning requires two essential components: 1) an
unbiased dataset with high-quality pixel-level multi-class labels, and 2) a
model capable of effectively linking audio information with its corresponding
visual object. However, these two requirements are only partially addressed by
current methods, with training sets containing biased audio-visual data, and
models that generalise poorly beyond this biased training set. In this work, we
propose a new strategy to build cost-effective and relatively unbiased
audio-visual semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our strategy, called Visual
Post-production (VPO), explores the observation that it is not necessary to
have explicit audio-visual pairs extracted from single video sources to build
such benchmarks. We also refine the previously proposed AVSBench to transform
it into the audio-visual semantic segmentation benchmark AVSBench-Single+.
Furthermore, this paper introduces a new pixel-wise audio-visual contrastive
learning method to enable a better generalisation of the model beyond the
training set. We verify the validity of the VPO strategy by showing that
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained with datasets built by matching audio
and visual data from different sources or with datasets containing audio and
visual data from the same video source produce almost the same accuracy. Then,
using the proposed VPO benchmarks and AVSBench-Single+, we show that our method
produces more accurate audio-visual semantic segmentation than SOTA models.
Code and dataset will be available.

learning in visual representation learning. The central objective of
contrastive learning is to maximize the similarities between two augmented

between different images (negative pairs). Recent studies have demonstrated
that harder negative samples, i.e., those that are more difficult to
differentiate from the anchor sample, perform a more crucial function in
contrastive learning. This paper proposes a novel feature-level method, namely
sampling synthetic hard negative samples for contrastive learning (SSCL), to
exploit harder negative samples more effectively. Specifically, 1) we generate
more and harder negative samples by mixing negative samples, and then sample
them by controlling the contrast of anchor sample with the other negative
samples; 2) considering the possibility of false negative samples, we further
debias the negative samples. Our proposed method improves the classification
performance on different image datasets and can be readily integrated into
existing methods.

mechanisms: examples are Galileo open service navigation message authentication
(OS-NMA) and GPS chips-message robust authentication (CHIMERA). Each of these
mechanisms operates in a single band. However, nowadays, even commercial GNSS
receivers typically compute the position, velocity, and time (PVT) solution
using multiple constellations and signals from multiple bands at once,
significantly improving both accuracy and availability. Hence,
cross-authentication checks have been proposed, based on the PVT obtained from
the mixture of authenticated and non-authenticated signals.
  In this paper, first, we formalize the models for the cross-authentication
checks. Next, we describe, for each check, a spoofing attack to generate a fake
signal leading the victim to a target PVT without notice. We analytically
relate the degrees of the freedom of the attacker in manipulating the victim's
solution to both the employed security checks and the number of open signals
that can be tampered with by the attacker. We test the performance of the
considered attack strategies on an experimental dataset. Lastly, we show the
limits of the PVT-based GNSS cross-authentication checks, where both
authenticated and non-authenticated signals are used.

faces and may be used to create counterfeit identities. Additionally, since
GANs models do not account for physiological constraints for generating human
faces and their impact on human IRISes, distinguishing genuine from synthetic
IRISes in the PS scenario becomes extremely difficult. As a result of the lack
of large-scale reference IRIS datasets in the PS scenario, we aim at developing
a novel dataset to become a standard for Multimedia Forensics (MFs)

the Lagrangian frame of reference as those sets of trajectories that stay
closely together for an extended time span under the action of the turbulent
flow. Depending on the choice of the coherence indicator sets with different
characteristics are detected. The application of a recently proposed
evolutionary spectral clustering scheme allows us to extract granular coherent
sets that are shown to contribute significantly less to the global heat
transfer than their spatial complements, which are concentrated in the centers
of the supergranules. Moreover, splits and mergers of the sets leave spectral
footprints. Supergranules can be related to trajectories that exhibit a small

  Domain-Shift in 3D Semantic Segmentation","Accepted at the CVPR2023 Workshop on Autonomous Driving (WAD)",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  3D semantic segmentation is a critical task in many real-world applications,
such as autonomous driving, robotics, and mixed reality. However, the task is
extremely challenging due to ambiguities coming from the unstructured, sparse,
and uncolored nature of the 3D point clouds. A possible solution is to combine
the 3D information with others coming from sensors featuring a different
modality, such as RGB cameras. Recent multi-modal 3D semantic segmentation
networks exploit these modalities relying on two branches that process the 2D
and 3D information independently, striving to maintain the strength of each
modality. In this work, we first explain why this design choice is effective
and then show how it can be improved to make the multi-modal semantic
segmentation more robust to domain shift. Our surprisingly simple contribution
achieves state-of-the-art performances on four popular multi-modal unsupervised
domain adaptation benchmarks, as well as better results in a domain

In this study, we investigate generic monochromatic enhancements to the
$\Lambda$CDM spectrum that trigger the collapse of ultracompact minihalos
(UCMHs) well before standard structure formation. We refine previous treatments
by considering a mixed population of halos with different density profiles,
that should realistically arise as a consequence of late-time accretion and
mergers. Assuming that dark matter (DM) can self-annihilate, we find, as
expected, that UCMHs can greatly enhance the annihilation rate around
recombination, significantly imprinting the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
anisotropies. However, we provide additional insight on the theoretical
uncertainties that currently impact that boost and which may affect late-time
probes such as the 21 cm line or $\gamma$-ray signals. We derive constraints on
the primordial power spectrum on small scales using the ExoCLASS/HYREC codes
and the Planck legacy data. We account for the velocity dependence of the DM
annihilation cross-section ($s$- or $p$-wave), annihilation channel, the DM
particle mass and the inclusion of late-time halo mergers. Our $s$-wave
constraints are competitive with previous literature, excluding primordial

(DPR) effect of the cyclotron maser instability may interpret observations. We
present the first electromagnetic relativistic particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulations of the electron-positron cyclotron maser for cyclotron frequency
smaller than the plasma frequency. In four distinct simulation cycles, we
focused on the effects of varying plasma parameters on the instability growth
rate and saturation energy. In contrast to the results obtained from
electron-proton plasma simulations, we found that the pulsar electron-positron
maser instability does not generate distinguishable X and Z modes. On the
contrary, a singular electromagnetic XZ mode is generated close to or above the
plasma frequency. Highest instability growth rates were obtained for the
simulations with integer plasma-to-cyclotron frequency ratios. The instability
is most efficient for plasma with characteristic loss-cone velocity in the
range $v_\mathrm{th}=$ 0.2 - 0.3$c$. For low density ratios, the highest peak
of the XZ mode is at the double frequency of the highest peak of the Bernstein
modes, indicating that the radio emission is produced by a coalescence of two
Bernstein modes with the same frequency and opposite wave numbers. Our estimate
of the radiative flux generated from the simulation is up to $\sim$ 30 mJy from

fluctuations in the frequency range of 2-25 mHz accelerate magnetically trapped
electrons to relativistic energies. For decades, statistical models of the
Earth's radiation belts have quantified the impact of Alfv\'enic waves in terms
of quasi-linear diffusive models. However, quasi-linear models are inadequate
to quantify Alfv\'enic radial transport occurring on timescales comparable to
the azimuthal drift period of $0.1- 10$ MeV electrons. With recent advances in
observational methodologies offering spatial and temporal coverage of the
Earth's radiation belts on fast timescales, a theoretical framework that
distinguishes between fast and diffusive radial transport can also be tested
for the first time with in situ measurements. In this report, we present a
drift kinetic description of radial transport for planetary radiation belts. We
characterize linear processes that are too fast to be modelled by quasi-linear
models and determine the conditions under which nonlinearities become
dynamically significant. In the linear regime, wave-particle interactions are
categorized in terms of resonant and non-resonant responses. We demonstrate
that the phenomenon of zebra stripes is non-resonant and can originate from the
injection of particles in the inner radiation belts. We derive a radial
diffusion coefficient for a field model that satisfies Faraday's law and that
contains two terms: one scaling as $L^{10}$ independent of the azimuthal number
$m$, and a second one scaling as $m^2 L^6$. In the nonlinear regime, we show
that azimuthally symmetric waves with properties consistent with in situ
measurements can energize 10-100 keV electrons in less than a drift period.
This coherent process provides new evidence that acceleration by Alfv\'enic
waves in radiation belts cannot be fully contained within diffusive models.

mechanisms by which energy is conveyed from the photosphere to the corona.
Recently, magnetic tornadoes, characterized as coherent, rotating magnetic
field structures extending from the photosphere to the corona, have drawn
growing interest as a possible means of efficient energy transfer. Despite its
acknowledged importance, the underlying physics of magnetic tornadoes remains
still elusive. In this study, we conduct a three-dimensional radiative
magnetohydrodynamic simulation that encompasses the upper convective layer and
extends into the corona, with a view to investigating how magnetic tornadoes
are generated and efficiently transfer energy into the corona. We find that a
single event of magnetic flux concentration merger on the photosphere gives
rise to the formation of a single magnetic tornado. The Poynting flux
transferred into the corona is found to be four times greater in the presence
of the magnetic tornado, as compared to its absence. This increase is
attributed to a reduction in energy loss in the chromosphere, resulting from
the weakened magnetic energy cascade. Based on an evaluation of the fraction of
the merging events, our results suggest that magnetic tornadoes contribute
approximately 50% of the Poynting flux into the corona in regions where the
coronal magnetic field strength is 10 G. Potentially, the contribution could be
even greater in areas with a stronger coronal magnetic field.

extensively studied, performing efficient data slicing and parallelization for
highly-constrai\-ned Multicore Neural Processor Units (NPUs) is still a
challenging problem. Given the size of convolutions' input/output tensors and
the small footprint of NPU on-chip memories, minimizing memory transactions
while maximizing parallelism and MAC utilization are central to any effective
solution. This paper proposes a TensorFlow XLA/LLVM compiler optimization pass
for Multicore NPUs, called Tensor Slicing Optimization (TSO), which: (a)
maximizes convolution parallelism and memory usage across NPU cores; and (b)
reduces data transfers between host and NPU on-chip memories by using DRAM
memory burst time estimates to guide tensor slicing. To evaluate the proposed
approach, a set of experiments was performed using the NeuroMorphic Processor
(NMP), a multicore NPU containing 32 RISC-V cores extended with novel CNN
instructions. Experimental results show that TSO is capable of identifying the
best tensor slicing that minimizes execution time for a set of CNN models.
Speed-ups of up to 21.7\% result when comparing the TSO burst-based technique
to a no-burst data slicing approach. To validate the generality of the TSO
approach, the algorithm was also ported to the Glow Machine Learning framework.
The performance of the models were measured on both Glow and TensorFlow
XLA/LLVM compilers, revealing similar results.

black-hole accretion discs can serve as a tool to measure parameters of the
central body and constrain the geometry of the inner accretion flow. We focus
on the case of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), with an accretion disc
dominating the UV/optical bands. We parameterize the changes in the thermal and
power-law components, which can reveal the diminution of the emissivity. To
this end we explore the effects of gaps in the accretion disc and the emerging
SED that can be caused by the presence of either (i) the inner, optically thin,
radiatively inefficient hot flow; (ii) a secondary black hole embedded within
the accretion disc; or (iii) a combination of both components. We suggest that
the resulting changes in the SED of the underlying continuum can help us to
understand some departures from the standard-disc scenario. We estimate that
the data required for such a project must be sampled in detail over the far-UV
to soft X-ray bands during the interval of about a month corresponding to the
characteristic variability timescale of an AGN. Detecting a gap at intermediate
radii of a few 100 gravitational radii would require quality photometry with
uncertainties up to $\sim$ 1%. The presence of the central cavity in the
standard disc can be recovered in UV photometric data with an accuracy of 5%
and better. We show the effect of the intrinsic reddening of the source and
demonstrate when it can be disentangled.

Scene-modelling photometry is used to obtain shot-noise-limited flux measures
for each exposure of each TNO, with background sources subtracted. Comparison
of double-source fits to the pixel data with single-source fits are used to
identify and characterize two binary TNO systems. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo
method samples the joint likelihood of the intrinsic colors of each source as
well as the amplitude of its flux variation, given the time series of multiband
flux measurements and their uncertainties. A catalog of these colors and light
curve amplitudes $A$ is included with this publication. We show how to assign a
likelihood to the distribution $q(A)$ of light curve amplitudes in any
subpopulation. Using this method, we find decisive evidence (i.e. evidence
ratio $<0.01$) that cold classical (CC) TNOs with absolute magnitude
$6<H_r<8.2$ are more variable than the hot classical (HC) population of the
same $H_r$, reinforcing theories that the former form in situ and the latter
arise from a different physical population. Resonant and scattering TNOs in
this $H_r$ range have variability consistent with either the HC's or CC's. DES
TNOs with $H_r<6$ are seen to be decisively less variable than higher-$H_r$
members of any dynamical group, as expected. More surprising is that detached
TNOs are decisively less variable than scattering TNOs, which requires them to
have distinct source regions or some subsequent differential processing.

the behavior of the flat low-energy moir\'e bands. For strong impurities and
vacancies in the $AA$ region we find a complete removal of one of the four
moir\'e bands, resulting in a significant depletion of the charge density in
the $AA$ regions even at extremely low defect concentrations. We find similar
results for other defect locations, with the exception of the least coordinated
sites in the $AB$ region, where defects instead result in a peculiar band
replacement process within the moir\'e bands. In the vacancy limit, this
process yields a band structure misleadingly similar to the pristine case.
Moreover, we show that triple point fermions, which are the crossing of the
Dirac point by a flat band, appearing for single, periodic, defects, are
generally not preserved when adding extended or multiple defects, and thus
likely not experimentally relevant. We further identify two universal length
scales for defects, consisting of charge modulations on the atomic scale and on
the moir\'e scale, illustrating the importance of both the atomic and moir\'e
structures for understanding TBG. We show that our conclusions hold beyond the
magic angle and for fully isolated defects. In summary, our results demonstrate
that the normal state of TBG and its moir\'e flat bands are extremely sensitive
to both the location and strength of non-magnetic impurities and vacancies,

content in various applications in the contemporary Internet era, such as

(LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks.
In this work, we propose TagGPT, a fully automated system capable of tag
extraction and multimodal tagging in a completely zero-shot fashion. Our core
insight is that, through elaborate prompt engineering, LLMs are able to extract
and reason about proper tags given textual clues of multimodal data, e.g., OCR,
ASR, title, etc. Specifically, to automatically build a high-quality tag set
that reflects user intent and interests for a specific application, TagGPT
predicts large-scale candidate tags from a series of raw data via prompting
LLMs, filtered with frequency and semantics. Given a new entity that needs
tagging for distribution, TagGPT introduces two alternative options for
zero-shot tagging, i.e., a generative method with late semantic matching with
the tag set, and another selective method with early matching in prompts. It is
well noticed that TagGPT provides a system-level solution based on a modular
framework equipped with a pre-trained LLM (GPT-3.5 used here) and a sentence
embedding model (SimCSE used here), which can be seamlessly replaced with any
more advanced one you want. TagGPT is applicable for various modalities of data
in modern social media and showcases strong generalization ability to a wide
range of applications. We evaluate TagGPT on publicly available datasets, i.e.,

paper carries that observation into MHD turbulence to examine the influence of
intermittent, sharp bends of the magnetic field lines on particle transport. On
the basis of dedicated measurements in a simulation of incompressible

in sufficient numbers on all scales to promote pitch-angle diffusion. The

with the above picture. Correspondingly, the overall transport process is
non-Brownian up to length scales $\gtrsim\ell_{\rm c}$.

change in treatment arms implies that also the optimal allocation rates will
change when treatments enter or leave the platform. In addition, the optimal

optimal treatment allocation rates for platform trials with shared controls,

using concurrent controls only as well as analysis methods based on also

uniformity and divergence of the H-/D- beam extracted from the source. The

some cases the beamlets were observed to be elongated in horizontal direction;
beamlet divergence values down to 20 mrad and 30 mrad e-folding were measured

address a more practical yet challenging counterpart setting - vision-language

agent, we propose a new navigation framework, ETPNav, which focuses on two
critical skills: 1) the capability to abstract environments and generate
long-range navigation plans, and 2) the ability of obstacle-avoiding control in
continuous environments. ETPNav performs online topological mapping of
environments by self-organizing predicted waypoints along a traversed path,
without prior environmental experience. It privileges the agent to break down

Concurrently, ETPNav utilizes a transformer-based cross-modal planner to
generate navigation plans based on topological maps and instructions. The plan
is then performed through an obstacle-avoiding controller that leverages a
trial-and-error heuristic to prevent navigation from getting stuck in
obstacles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. ETPNav yields more than 10% and 20% improvements over prior

  Users and Its Countermeasures","This paper has been accepted by SIGIR2023",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Federated Recommender Systems (FedRecs) are considered privacy-preserving
techniques to collaboratively learn a recommendation model without sharing user
data. Since all participants can directly influence the systems by uploading
gradients, FedRecs are vulnerable to poisoning attacks of malicious clients.
However, most existing poisoning attacks on FedRecs are either based on some
prior knowledge or with less effectiveness. To reveal the real vulnerability of
FedRecs, in this paper, we present a new poisoning attack method to manipulate
target items' ranks and exposure rates effectively in the top-$K$
recommendation without relying on any prior knowledge. Specifically, our attack
manipulates target items' exposure rate by a group of synthetic malicious users
who upload poisoned gradients considering target items' alternative products.
We conduct extensive experiments with two widely used FedRecs (Fed-NCF and
Fed-LightGCN) on two real-world recommendation datasets. The experimental
results show that our attack can significantly improve the exposure rate of
unpopular target items with extremely fewer malicious users and fewer global
epochs than state-of-the-art attacks. In addition to disclosing the security
hole, we design a novel countermeasure for poisoning attacks on FedRecs.
Specifically, we propose a hierarchical gradient clipping with sparsified
updating to defend against existing poisoning attacks. The empirical results
demonstrate that the proposed defending mechanism improves the robustness of
FedRecs.

  noise in relative pose measurements","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics journal on April 3. 2023",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  A technique that allows a formation-enforcing control (FEC) derived from
graph rigidity theory to interface with a realistic relative localization
system is proposed in this paper. Recent research in sensor-based multi-robot
control has given rise to multiple modalities of mutual relative localization
systems. In particular, vision-based relative localization has reached the
stage where it can be carried onboard lightweight UAVs in order to retrieve the
relative positions and relative orientations of cooperating units. A separate
stream of development spawned distributed formation-enforcing control which can
lead individual robots into a desired formation using relative localization of
their neighbors. These two fields naturally complement each other by achieving
real-world flights of UAVs in formation without the need for absolute
localization in the world. However, real relative localization systems are,
without exception, burdened by non-negligible sensory noise, which is typically
not fully taken into account in formation-enforcing control algorithms. Such
noise can lead to rapid changes in velocity, which further interferes with
visual localization. Our approach provides a solution to these challenges,
enabling practical deployment of FEC under realistic conditions, as we
demonstrated in real-world experiments.

yields the tightest lower bound among all lower bounds induced by affine

their bulk counterparts. A paradigmatic example is Ising superconductivity that
occurs in monolayer materials such as NbSe2 which show a strong violation of
the Pauli limit. In monolayers, this occurs due to a combination of broken
inversion symmetry and spin-orbit coupling that locks the spins of the
electrons out-of-plane. Bulk NbSe2 is centrosymmetric and is therefore not an
Ising superconductor. We show that bulk misfit compound superconductors,
(LaSe)1.14(NbSe2) and (LaSe)1.14(NbSe2)2, comprised of monolayers and bilayers
of NbSe2, exhibit unexpected Ising protection with a Pauli-limit violation
comparable to monolayer NbSe2, despite formally having inversion symmetry. We
study these misfit compounds using complementary experimental methods in
combination with first-principles calculations. We propose theoretical
mechanisms of how the Ising protection can survive in bulk materials. We show
how some of these mechanisms operate in these bulk compounds due to a concerted
effect of charge-transfer, defects, reduction of interlayer hopping, and
stacking. This highlights how Ising superconductivity can, unexpectedly, arise
in bulk materials, and possibly enable the design of bulk superconductors that

at the expense of numerous complex coding tools, particularly the flexible

deep learning-based algorithm applied in fast QTMT partition for VVC intra

less-likely intra prediction and partitions with negligible BD-BR increase.
Firstly, a redesigned U-Net is recommended as the network's fundamental
framework. Next, we design a Quality Parameter (QP) fusion network to regulate
the effect of QPs on the partition results. Finally, we adopt a refined
post-processing strategy to better balance encoding performance and complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our solution outperforms the
state-of-the-art works with a complexity reduction of 44.74% to 68.76% and a
BD-BR increase of 0.60% to 2.33%.

is often used to specify safety aspects. In the real world, often the state

unintended negative side effects (NSEs). To address these challenges, first, we
associate safety signals with state-action trajectories (rather than just an
immediate state-action). This makes our safety model highly general. We also
assume categorical safety labels are given for different trajectories, rather
than a numerical cost function, which is harder to specify by the problem
designer. We then employ a supervised learning model to learn such
non-Markovian safety patterns. Second, we develop a Lagrange multiplier method,
which incorporates the safety model and the underlying MDP model in a single
computation graph to facilitate agent learning of safe behaviors. Finally, our
empirical results on a variety of discrete and continuous domains show that
this approach can satisfy complex non-Markovian safety constraints while
optimizing an agent's total returns, is highly scalable, and is also better

when strong disorder is present. However, recent studies have shown that
finite-size SU(2) systems exhibit non-ergodic, subthermal behavior,
characterized by the breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and
by the excited eigenstates entanglement entropy that is intermediate between
area and volume law. In this work, we extend previous studies of the
SU(2)-symmetric disordered Heisenberg model to larger systems, using the
time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) method. We simulate
quench dynamics from weakly entangled initial states up to long times, finding
robust subthermal behavior at stronger disorder. Although we find an increased
tendency towards thermalization at larger system sizes, the subthermal regime
persists at intermediate time scales, nevertheless, and therefore should be
accessible experimentally. At weaker disorder, we observe signatures of
thermalization, however, entanglement entropy exhibits slow sublinear growth,
in contrast to conventional thermalizing systems. Furthermore, we study
dynamics of the SU(3)-symmetric disordered Heisenberg model. Similarly, strong
disorder drives the system into subthermal regime, albeit thermalizing phase is
broader compared to the SU(2) case. Our findings demonstrate the robustness of
the subthermal regime in spin chains with non-Abelian continuous symmetry, and
are consistent with eventual thermalization at large system sizes and long time
scales, suggested by previous works.

GAPretrain serves as a plug-and-play solution that can be flexibly applied to
multiple state-of-the-art detectors. Our experiments demonstrate the

46.2 mAP and 55.5 NDS on the nuScenes val set using the BEVFormer method, with

quantum systems that look like they violate the laws of thermodynamics, in
analogy with Maxwell's demon. It concentrates on autonomous demons that can be
made using nanoelectronics. Here ``autonomous'' means that the demon operates
without any external measurement or driving, making it possible to model their
entire thermodynamic behaviour using Schr\""odinger's equation. My main aim is
to review why cracks in the laws of thermodynamics, sometimes glimpsed in such
systems, have turned out to be illusory.
  For this, I work by example, introducing the methods of quantum
thermodynamics via an old thought experiment that appears to break the second
law. This thought experiment is usually known as Smoluchowski's trapdoor,
although it was first proposed by Maxwell. Smoluchowski showed that the
trapdoor's thermal motion complicates its dynamics, but I argue that he did not
show that it must obey the second law. This question is now of practical
relevance, because a nanoelectronic version of the trapdoor can be made with
quantum dots. The methods presented here show that such a quantum trapdoor
obeys the laws of thermodynamics.
  This reviews then addresses other types of autonomous demon that
superficially appear to break the laws of thermodynamics, but which do not.
These include an experimental demonstration of a Maxwell demon, and a kind of
demon that exploit non-equilibrium resources (the N-demon). It discusses a way
of classifying different kinds of autonomous demon. It concludes by briefly
reviewing how fluctuations affect nanoelectronics, and how their role in
stochastic thermodynamics changes our view of entropy.

estimating the surplus contributions requires sampling from conditional

leverage causal structure learning (CSL) to infer a graph that encodes

for computing the cohomology of non-semi-simple Leibniz algebras. The main idea
of the present paper is to use similar tools as developed by Farnsteiner for

be possible to relate the cohomology of a Leibniz algebra directly to
Hochschild cohomology as is the case for Lie algebras, but all the desired
results can be obtained in a similar way. In particular, this enables us to
generalize the vanishing theorems of Dixmier and Barnes for nilpotent and

methods still have some limitations in the quality of generated images and may
suffer from the mode collapse issue. A key reason is that a fixed adaptation
direction is applied for all cross-domain image pairs, which leads to identical

every cross-domain image pair, endowing the target-domain generator with
greatly enhanced flexibility. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on
various domains demonstrate that IPL effectively improves the quality and
diversity of synthesized images and alleviates the mode collapse. Moreover, IPL
is independent of the structure of the generative model, such as generative

entropy. We obtain several other refined structural and spectral results, one
consequence of which is that the Archimedean characters are the only
pretentious multiplicative functions that have Furstenberg systems with trivial
rational spectrum, another is that a pretentious multiplicative function has
ergodic Furstenberg systems if and only if it pretends to be a Dirichlet
character, and a last one is that for any fixed pretentious multiplicative
function all its Furstenberg systems are isomorphic. We also study structural
properties of Furstenberg systems of a class of multiplicative functions,
introduced by Matom\""aki, Radziwill, and Tao, which lie in the intermediate
zone between pretentiousness and strong aperiodicity. In a work of the last two
authors and Gomilko, several examples of this class with exotic ergodic
behavior were identified, and here we complement this study and discover some
new unexpected phenomena. Lastly, we prove that Furstenberg systems of general
bounded multiplicative functions have divisible spectrum. When these systems
are obtained using logarithmic averages, we show that trivial rational spectrum
implies a strong dilation invariance property, called strong stationarity, but,
quite surprisingly, this property fails when the systems are obtained using
Ces\`aro averages.

consisting of an accretion disc, a Comptonised blackbody, relativistic

combination of the large effective area and good energy resolution of NuSTAR at
high energies, we found evidence of relativistic reflection in both the Fe K
line profile, and the Compton hump present in the 10--25 keV energy range. The
inner disc radius is $R_{\rm in} \lesssim 9.6~r_g$, which allowed us to further
constrain the magnetic field strength to $B \lesssim 1.8 \times 10^8$ G. We
also found evidence for the presence of a hot wind leading to photo-ionised
absorption of Fe and Ni, with a Ni overabundance of $\sim$6 times solar. From
the spectral fits, we find that the distance between the ionising source and
the slab of ionised absorbing material is $\sim 4-40 \times 10^5$ km. We also
found that the width of the boundary layer extends $\sim$3 km above the surface
of a neutron star, which yielded a neutron-star radius $R_{\rm NS}\lesssim 16$

only for high electron densities in the accretion disk, $n_e \sim

significantly above the densities provided by relxillNS models. These results

applications like autonomous driving or video surveillance. However, confusing
human-like objects often lead to wrong detections, and small scale or heavily
occluded pedestrians are easily missed due to their unusual appearances. To
address these challenges, only object regions are inadequate, thus how to fully
utilize more explicit and semantic contexts becomes a key problem. Meanwhile,
previous context-aware pedestrian detectors either only learn latent contexts
with visual clues, or need laborious annotations to obtain explicit and
semantic contexts. Therefore, we propose in this paper a novel approach via
Vision-Language semantic self-supervision for context-aware Pedestrian
Detection (VLPD) to model explicitly semantic contexts without any extra
annotations. Firstly, we propose a self-supervised Vision-Language Semantic
(VLS) segmentation method, which learns both fully-supervised pedestrian
detection and contextual segmentation via self-generated explicit labels of
semantic classes by vision-language models. Furthermore, a self-supervised
Prototypical Semantic Contrastive (PSC) learning method is proposed to better
discriminate pedestrians and other classes, based on more explicit and semantic
contexts obtained from VLS. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show
that our proposed VLPD achieves superior performances over the previous
state-of-the-arts, particularly under challenging circumstances like small
scale and heavy occlusion. Code is available at

numbers, based on the Keldysh path-integral formalism and replica trick. In the
limit of rare measurements, $\gamma / J \ll 1$ (where $\gamma$ is measurement
rate per site and $J$ is hopping constant in the tight-binding model), we
derive a non-linear sigma model (NLSM) as an effective field theory of the
problem. Its replica-symmetric sector is described by a $U(2) / U(1) \times
U(1) \simeq S_2$ sigma model with diffusive behavior, and the
replica-asymmetric sector is a two-dimensional NLSM defined on $SU(R)$ manifold
with the replica limit $R \to 1$. On the Gaussian level, valid in the limit
$\gamma / J \to 0$, this model predicts a logarithmic behavior for the second
cumulant of number of particles in a subsystem and for the entanglement
entropy. However, the one-loop renormalization group analysis allows us to
demonstrate that this logarithmic growth saturates at a finite value $\sim (J /
\gamma)^2$ even for rare measurements, which corresponds to the area-law phase.
This implies the absence of a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition
for free fermions. The crossover between logarithmic growth and saturation,
however, happens at exponentially large scale, $\ln l_\text{corr} \sim J /
\gamma$. This makes this crossover very sharp as a function of the measurement
frequency $\gamma / J$, which can be easily confused with a transition from the
logarithmic to area law in finite-size numerical calculations. We have
performed a careful numerical analysis, which supports our analytical
predictions.

present a novel saliency-guided vision transformer, dubbed SalViT, for few-shot
keypoint detection. Our SalViT enjoys a uniquely designed masked self-attention
and a morphology learner, where the former introduces saliency map as a soft
mask to constrain the self-attention on foregrounds, while the latter leverages
the so-called power normalization to adjust morphology of saliency map,
realizing ``dynamically changing receptive field''. Moreover, as salinecy
detectors add computations, we show that attentive masks of DINO transformer
can replace saliency. On top of SalViT, we also investigate i) transductive
FSKD that enhances keypoint representations with unlabelled data and ii) FSKD
under occlusions. We show that our model performs well on five public datasets
and achieves ~10% PCK higher than the normally trained model under severe
occlusions.

future space-based gravitational-wave detector LISA with a large

differentiating higher harmonics in the inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR)
waveform. In this study, we test the ability of LISA to identify the presence
of different modes in the IMR waveform from a SMBHB. We analyze the
contribution of each mode to the total SNR for different sources. We show that
higher modes, in particular, the mode $(3, 3)$ and $(4, 4)$, can dominate the
signal observed through the LISA detector for SMBHB of the order of $10^8
M_\odot$. With Bayesian analysis, we can discriminate models with different IMR
modes. While higher modes are often considered to be orthogonal, it is no
longer the case in the merger-ringdown phase. Therefore, omitting harmonics not
only diminishes the SNR but can also lead to biases in the parameter
estimation. We analyze the bias for each model for our example system and
quantify the threshold SNR where we can expect the parameter bias to be
comparable to the statistical error. Our work highlights the importance of
higher modes to describe the gravitational waveform of events detected by LISA.

$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for a $k$-clustering problem that runs
in time $f(k,\epsilon)poly(n)$ (sometimes called an efficient parameterized
approximation scheme or EPAS for short). Notable results of this kind include
EPASes in the high-dimensional Euclidean setting for $k$-center [Bad\u{o}iu,
Har-Peled, Indyk; STOC'02] as well as $k$-median, and $k$-means [Kumar,
Sabharwal, Sen; J. ACM 2010]. However, existing EPASes handle only basic
objectives (such as $k$-center, $k$-median, and $k$-means) and are tailored to
the specific objective and metric space.
  Our main contribution is a clean and simple EPAS that settles more than ten
clustering problems (across multiple well-studied objectives as well as metric
spaces) and unifies well-known EPASes. Our algorithm gives EPASes for a large
variety of clustering objectives (for example, $k$-means, $k$-center,
$k$-median, priority $k$-center, $\ell$-centrum, ordered $k$-median, socially
fair $k$-median aka robust $k$-median, or more generally monotone norm
$k$-clustering) and metric spaces (for example, continuous high-dimensional
Euclidean spaces, metrics of bounded doubling dimension, bounded treewidth
metrics, and planar metrics).
  Key to our approach is a new concept that we call bounded $\epsilon$-scatter
dimension--an intrinsic complexity measure of a metric space that is a
relaxation of the standard notion of bounded doubling dimension. Our main
technical result shows that two conditions are essentially sufficient for our
algorithm to yield an EPAS on the input metric $M$ for any clustering
objective: (i) The objective is described by a monotone (not necessarily
symmetric!) norm, and (ii) the $\epsilon$-scatter dimension of $M$ is upper
bounded by a function of $\epsilon$.

the accuracy of VQA models under increasing levels of noise in the input, which

question. However, there is currently a lack of proper analysis of this aspect
of VQA. This work proposes a new method that utilizes semantically related
questions, referred to as basic questions, acting as noise to evaluate the
robustness of VQA models. It is hypothesized that as the similarity of a basic

generate a reasonable noise level for a given main question, a pool of basic
questions is ranked based on their similarity to the main question, and this
ranking problem is cast as a LASSO optimization problem. Additionally, this
work proposes a novel robustness measure, R_score, and two basic question

results demonstrate that the proposed evaluation method effectively analyzes
the robustness of VQA models. Moreover, the experiments show that in-context

previously watched movies, and recommend a ranked list of 10 movies. We

magnetic field. Two distinct La NMR signals were observed due to the two
crystallographically inequivalent La sites in La2Ni7 (La1 and La2 in the La2Ni4
and the LaNi5 sub-units of the La2Ni7 unit cell, respectively). From the 139La
NQR spectrum in the AFM state below $T_{N3}$, the AFM state was revealed to be
a commensurate state where Ni ordered moments align along the crystalline c
axis. Owing to the two different La sites, we were able to estimate the average
values of the Ni ordered moments ($\sim$0.07-0.08 $\mu_{B}$/Ni and
$\sim$0.17$\mu_{B}$/Ni around La1 and La2, respectively) from 139La NMR
spectrum measurements in the AFM state below $T_{N3}$, suggesting a non-uniform
distribution of the Ni-ordered moments in the AFM state. In contrast, a more
uniform distribution of the Ni-ordered moments in the saturated paramagnetic
state induced by the application of high magnetic fields is observed. The
temperature dependence of the sublattice magnetization measured by the internal
field at the La2 site in the AFM state was reproduced by a local moment model
better than the self-consistent renormalization (SCR) theory for weak itinerant
antiferromagnets. Given the small Ni-ordered moments in the magnetically
ordered state, our results suggest that La2Ni7 has characteristics of both
itinerant and localized natures in its magnetism. With this in mind, it is
noteworthy that the temperature dependence of nuclear spin-relaxation rates in
the paramagnetic state above $T_{N1}$ measured at zero magnetic field can be
explained qualitatively by both the SCR theory and the local-moment model.

investigate the behavior, particularly the variability, of the photometric

with a cadence of 5 x the rotation period, Prot. The average Sph was taken as
the mean activity level, and the standard deviation was taken as a measure of
the temporal variation of the magnetic activity over the observations. We also
analyzed Sun-as-a-star photometric data from VIRGO. Sun-like stars were
selected from a very narrow parameter space around the solar properties. We
also looked into KIC 8006161 (HD 173701), an active metal-rich G dwarf, and we
compared its magnetic activity to that of stars with similar stellar
parameters. We find that the amplitude of Sph variability is strongly
correlated with its mean value, independent of spectral type. An equivalent
relationship has been found for ground-based observations of chromospheric
activity emission and magnetic field strength, but in this work we show that
photometric Kepler data also present the same behavior. While, depending on the
cycle phase, the Sun is among the less active stars, we find that the solar Sph
properties are consistent with those observed in Kepler Sun-like stars. KIC
8006161 is, however, among the most active of its peers, which tend to be
metal-rich. This results from an underlying relationship between Prot and
metallicity and supports the following interpretation of the magnetic activity
of KIC 8006161: its strong activity is a consequence of its high metallicity,
which affects the depth of the convection zone and, consequently, the
efficiency of the dynamo.

science, especially, in resource management and information flow control. What
connects these analyses is that both of them need to model at least two
different worlds with constrained mutual interaction. Though linearity and
dependency analyses address similar problems, the analyses are carried out by
employing different methods. For linearity analysis, type systems employ the
comonadic exponential modality from Girard's linear logic. For dependency
analysis, type systems employ the monadic modality from Moggi's computational
metalanguage. Owing to this methodical difference, a unification of the two
analyses, though theoretically and practically desirable, is not
straightforward.
  Fortunately, with recent advances in graded-context type systems, it has been
realized that linearity and dependency analyses can be viewed through the same
lens. However, existing graded-context type systems fall short of a unification
of linearity and dependency analyses. The problem with existing graded-context
type systems is that though their linearity analysis is general, their
dependency analysis is limited, primarily because the graded modality they
employ is comonadic and not monadic. In this paper, we address this limitation
by systematically extending existing graded-context type systems so that the
graded modality is both comonadic and monadic. This extension enables us to
unify linearity analysis with a general dependency analysis. We present a
unified Linear Dependency Calculus, LDC, which analyses linearity and
dependency using the same mechanism in an arbitrary Pure Type System. We show
that LDC is a general linear and dependency calculus by subsuming into it the
standard calculi for the individual analyses.

is very significant for simulating dispersed particle phases at different
Knudsen numbers due to the variation of physical properties in individual
particle phase, such as the particle diameter, material density, and the
corresponding mass fraction inside each control volume. For the gas phase, the
GKS is basically an Eulerian approach for the NS solution. Therefore, the
GKS-UGKWP method for the gas-particle flow unifies the Eulerian-Eulerian (EE)

the solid particle phase with the consideration of physical accuracy and
numerical efficiency. Two cases of gas-solid fluidization system, i.e., one

We show also a nice relation with a five dimensional metric. When done, we will
see that the traditional complex electromagnetic coupling could be handled also
without complex numbers by just considering two coupled real fields instead of
one complex field. Finally, we will show that going toward six or ten
dimensional spacetime would be more natural from a group point of view.

has enormous potential to advance human health, environmental sustainability,

these challenges theoretically, through the lens of kernels. Methods based on
kernels are ubiquitous: they are used to predict molecular phenotypes, design
novel proteins, compare sequence distributions, and more. Many methods that do
not use kernels explicitly still rely on them implicitly, including a wide
variety of both deep learning and physics-based techniques. While kernels for
other types of data are well-studied theoretically, the structure of biological
sequence space (discrete, variable length sequences), as well as biological
notions of sequence similarity, present unique mathematical challenges. We
formally analyze how well kernels for biological sequences can approximate
arbitrary functions on sequence space and how well they can distinguish
different sequence distributions. In particular, we establish conditions under
which biological sequence kernels are universal, characteristic and metrize the
space of distributions. We show that a large number of existing kernel-based
machine learning methods for biological sequences fail to meet our conditions
and can as a consequence fail severely. We develop straightforward and
computationally tractable ways of modifying existing kernels to satisfy our
conditions, imbuing them with strong guarantees on accuracy and reliability.

main idea of Knowledge Tracing (KT), which models students' mastery of
knowledge concepts (KCs, skills needed to solve a question) based on their past
interactions on platforms. Plenty of KT models have been proposed and have
shown remarkable performance recently. However, the majority of these models
use concepts to index questions, which means the predefined skill tags for each
question are required in advance to indicate the KCs needed to answer that
question correctly. This makes it pretty hard to apply on large-scale online
education platforms where questions are often not well-organized by skill tags.
In this paper, we propose Q-matrix-based Attentive Knowledge Tracing (QAKT), an
end-to-end style model that is able to apply the attentive method to scenes
where no predefined skill tags are available without sacrificing its
performance. With a novel hybrid embedding method based on the q-matrix and
Rasch model, QAKT is capable of modeling problems hierarchically and learning
the q-matrix efficiently based on students' sequences. Meanwhile, the
architecture of QAKT ensures that it is friendly to questions associated with
multiple skills and has outstanding interpretability. After conducting
experiments on a variety of open datasets, we empirically validated that our
model shows similar or even better performance than state-of-the-art KT
methods. Results of further experiments suggest that the q-matrix learned by
QAKT is highly model-agnostic and more information-sufficient than the one
labeled by human experts, which could help with the data mining tasks in

away. One would naively think that seeing one planet pass in front of another
would settle the matter. In practice such mutual phenomena happen too rarely
for them to have been useful. Even in principle, it turns out that most
naked-eye observations of a central event would show nothing conclusive, with
the exception of some occultations by Venus that would demonstrate it to be the
lowest (nearest) planet. However, if one's theory were good enough to allow
conclusions from {\it not} seeing changes, one could find that Mars is probably
lower than Jupiter and Saturn, and possibly that the overall order is
Venus-Mars-Jupiter-Saturn-Mercury.

individuals can be randomly assigned an outcome determined by a fixed

clear violation of individual fairness. Assigning unique odds to each protected

another type of unfairness called individual odds. We reconcile all this by
constructing continuous probability functions between group thresholds that are

  Loss-Guided Lp Metric",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Efficient inference for object detection networks is a major challenge on
edge devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ), which transforms a
full-precision model into low bit-width directly, is an effective and
convenient approach to reduce model inference complexity. But it suffers severe
accuracy drop when applied to complex tasks such as object detection. PTQ
optimizes the quantization parameters by different metrics to minimize the
perturbation of quantization. The p-norm distance of feature maps before and
after quantization, Lp, is widely used as the metric to evaluate perturbation.
For the specialty of object detection network, we observe that the parameter p
in Lp metric will significantly influence its quantization performance. We
indicate that using a fixed hyper-parameter p does not achieve optimal
quantization performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose a framework,
DetPTQ, to assign different p values for quantizing different layers using an
Object Detection Output Loss (ODOL), which represents the task loss of object
detection. DetPTQ employs the ODOL-based adaptive Lp metric to select the
optimal quantization parameters. Experiments show that our DetPTQ outperforms
the state-of-the-art PTQ methods by a significant margin on both 2D and 3D
object detectors. For example, we achieve
31.1/31.7(quantization/full-precision) mAP on RetinaNet-ResNet18 with 4-bit

  impact of radiation on the outflow morphology",,,,,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stars with an initial mass below ~ 8 Msun evolve through the asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) phase, during which they develop strong stellar winds. Recent
observations have revealed significant morphological complexities in their
outflows, most likely caused by a companion. We study the impact of the
radiation force on such companion-perturbed AGB outflows. We present the
implementation of a ray tracer for radiative transfer in smoothed particle
hydrodynamics (SPH) and compared four different descriptions of radiative
transfer: the free-wind, the geometrical, the Lucy, and the attenuation
approximation. For both low and high mass-loss rates, the velocity profile of
the outflow is modified when going from the free-wind to the geometrical
approximation, also resulting in a different morphology. In the case of a low
mass-loss rate, the effect of the Lucy and attenuation approximation is
negligible due to the low densities but morphological differences appear in the
high mass-loss rate regime. By comparing the radiative equilibrium temperature
and radiation force to full 3D radiative transfer, we show that the Lucy
approximation works best. Although, close to the companion, artificial heating
occurs and it fails to simulate the shadow cast by the companion. The
attenuation approximation produces a lower equilibrium temperature and weaker
radiation force, but it produces the shadow cast by the companion. From the
predictions of the 3D radiative transfer, we also conclude that a radially
directed radiation force is a reasonable assumption. The radiation force thus
plays a critical role in dust-driven AGB winds, impacting the velocity profile
and morphological structures. For low mass-loss rates, the geometrical
approximation suffices, while high mass-loss rates require a more rigorous
method, where the Lucy approximation provides the most accurate results
although not accounting for all effects.

two effects on gas stripping in HI-bearing galaxies: the strength of external
forces at the optical-disk edge, and the outside-in extents of HI-disk
stripping. We find that gas stripping is widespread in this group, affecting
80% of HI-detected non-merging galaxies, and that 34% are experiencing both
types of stripping. Among the galaxies experiencing both effects, the strengths
(and extents) of ram-pressure and tidal stripping are independent of each
other. Both strengths are correlated with HI-disk shrinkage. The tidal strength
is related to a rather uniform reddening of low-mass galaxies
($M_*<10^9\,\text{M}_\odot$) when tidal stripping is the dominating effect. In
contrast, ram pressure is not clearly linked to the color-changing patterns of
galaxies in the group. Combining these two stripping extents, we estimate the
total stripping extent, and put forward an empirical model that can describe
the decrease of HI richness as galaxies fall toward the group center. The
stripping timescale we derived decreases with distance to the center, from
$\mathord{\sim}1\,\text{Gyr}$ around $R_{200}$ to
$\mathord{\lesssim}10\,\text{Myr}$ near the center. Gas-depletion happens
$\mathord{\sim}3\,\text{Gyr}$ since crossing $2R_{200}$ for HI-rich galaxies,
but much quicker for HI-poor ones. Our results quantify in a physically

heavily on prompt design, with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and self-consistency

fully exploit the answers generated by the LLM to guide subsequent responses.
This paper proposes a new prompting method, named Progressive-Hint Prompting
(PHP), that enables automatic multiple interactions between users and LLMs by
using previously generated answers as hints to progressively guide toward the
correct answers. PHP is orthogonal to CoT and self-consistency, making it easy
to combine with state-of-the-art techniques to further improve performance. We
conducted extensive and comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks. The
results show that PHP significantly improves accuracy while remaining highly
efficient. For instance, with text-davinci-003, we observed a 4.2% improvement
on GSM8K with greedy decoding compared to Complex CoT, and a 46.17% reduction
in sample paths with self-consistency. With GPT-4 and PHP, we achieve

move strategically on networks and interact with those they meet in groups of

stochastic update rules seldom influences evolutionary outcomes. Cooperation
robustly co-evolves with movement on complete networks and structure has a

wisdom in evolutionary graph theory that cooperation can only emerge under some
update rules and if the average degree is low. We find that group-dependent
movement erases the locality of interactions, suppresses the impact of
evolutionary structural viscosity on the fitness of individuals, and leads to
assortative behaviour that is much more powerful than viscosity in promoting
cooperation. We analyse the differences remaining between update rules through

However, in real-world applications, sensor corruptions and failures lead to
inferior performances, thus compromising autonomous safety. In this paper, we
propose a robust framework, called MetaBEV, to address extreme real-world
environments involving overall six sensor corruptions and two extreme
sensor-missing situations. In MetaBEV, signals from multiple sensors are first
processed by modal-specific encoders. Subsequently, a set of dense BEV queries
are initialized, termed meta-BEV. These queries are then processed iteratively
by a BEV-Evolving decoder, which selectively aggregates deep features from
either LiDAR, cameras, or both modalities. The updated BEV representations are
further leveraged for multiple 3D prediction tasks. Additionally, we introduce
a new M2oE structure to alleviate the performance drop on distinct tasks in
multi-task joint learning. Finally, MetaBEV is evaluated on the nuScenes
dataset with 3D object detection and BEV map segmentation tasks. Experiments
show MetaBEV outperforms prior arts by a large margin on both full and
corrupted modalities. For instance, when the LiDAR signal is missing, MetaBEV
improves 35.5% detection NDS and 17.7% segmentation mIoU upon the vanilla
BEVFusion model; and when the camera signal is absent, MetaBEV still achieves
69.2% NDS and 53.7% mIoU, which is even higher than previous works that perform
on full-modalities. Moreover, MetaBEV performs fairly against previous methods
in both canonical perception and multi-task learning settings, refreshing

when tuning the Fermi surface geometry. We illustrate our approach using
recently measured phase diagrams of various graphene systems. Our analysis
unambiguously connects the emergence of superconductivity at ``ghost

backscattering type. Together with the observed non-monotonic behavior of
superconductivity near its onset (sharp rise followed by a drop), it provides
strong support for a particular quantum-critical superconductivity scenario.

insights into how neurons self-organize to produce coherent collective
behavior. These networks use simple spiking neuron models, such as the
$\theta$-neuron or the quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neuron, that
replicate the essential features of real neural dynamics. Interactions between
neurons are modeled with infinitely narrow pulses, or spikes, rather than the
more complex dynamics of real synapses. To make these networks biologically
more plausible, it has been proposed that they must also account for the finite
width of the pulses, which can have a significant impact on the network
dynamics. However, the derivation and interpretation of these pulses is
contradictory and the impact of the pulse shape on the network dynamics is
largely unexplored. Here, I take a comprehensive approach to pulse-coupling in
networks of QIF and $\theta$-neurons. I argue that narrow pulses activate
voltage-dependent synaptic conductances and show how to implement them in QIF
neurons such that their effect can last through the phase after the spike.
Using an exact low-dimensional description for networks of globally coupled
spiking neurons, I prove for instantaneous interactions that collective
oscillations emerge due to an effective coupling through the mean voltage. I
analyze the impact of the pulse shape by means of a family of smooth pulse
functions with arbitrary finite width and symmetric or asymmetric shapes. For
symmetric pulses, the resulting voltage-coupling is little effective in
synchronizing neurons, but pulses that are slightly skewed to the phase after
the spike readily generate collective oscillations. The results unveil a
voltage-dependent spike synchronization mechanism in neural networks, which is
facilitated by pulses of finite width and complementary to traditional synaptic
transmission.

the search for the quantum algorithms that will deliver practical quantum
advantage first. Today's quantum computers and even early fault-tolerant
quantum computers will be limited in the number of operations they can
implement per circuit. We introduce quantum algorithms for ground state energy
estimation (GSEE) that accommodate this design constraint. The first estimates
ground state energies and has a quadratic improvement on the ground state
overlap parameter compared to other methods in this regime. The second
certifies that the estimated ground state energy is within a specified error
tolerance of the true ground state energy, addressing the issue of gap
estimation that beleaguers several ground state preparation and energy
estimation algorithms. We note, however, that the scaling of this certification
technique is, unfortunately, worse than that of the GSEE algorithm. These
algorithms are based on a novel use of the quantum computer to facilitate
rejection sampling. After a classical computer is used to draw samples, the
quantum computer is used to accept or reject the samples. The set of accepted
samples correspond to draws from a target distribution. While we use this
technique for ground state energy estimation, it may find broader application.
Our work pushes the boundaries of what operation-limited quantum computers are
capable of and thus brings the target of quantum advantage closer to the
present.

loss in nanophotonics. Rayleigh backscattering can be particularly difficult to
avoid in wave-guiding systems and arises from both material defects and
geometric defects at the subwavelength scale. It has been previously shown that
systems with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) can naturally suppress
detrimental Rayleigh backscattering, but these approaches have never been
demonstrated in integrated photonics or through practical TRS-breaking
techniques. In this work, we show that it is possible to suppress
disorder-induced Rayleigh backscattering in integrated photonics via electrical
excitation, even when defects are clearly present. Our experiment is performed
in a lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) integrated ring resonator at telecom
wavelength, in which TRS is strongly broken through an acousto-optic
interaction that is induced via radiofrequency input. We present evidence that
Rayleigh backscattering in the resonator is almost completely suppressed by
measuring both the optical density of states and through direct measurements of
the back-scattered light. We additionally provide an intuitive argument to show
that, in an appropriate frame of reference, the suppression of backscattering
can be readily understood as a form of topological protection.

function from a large prior dataset of other robots navigating in other

representation. From here, a sample-efficient online RL method uses a single
low-speed user-provided demonstration to determine the desired driving course,
extracts a set of navigational checkpoints, and autonomously practices driving
through these checkpoints, resetting automatically on collision or failure.
Perhaps surprisingly, we find that with appropriate initialization and choice
of algorithm, our system can learn to drive over a variety of racing courses
with less than 20 minutes of online training. The resulting policies exhibit
emergent aggressive driving skills, such as timing braking and acceleration
around turns and avoiding areas which impede the robot's motion, approaching
the performance of a human driver using a similar first-person interface over

quasars selected from the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey

of 0.210 Jy km/s. Depending on the assumptions made, this value can be
interpreted as either an average CO line luminosity $L'_\mathrm{CO}$ of eBOSS
quasars of $\leq 7.30\times10^{10}$ K km pc$^2$ s$^{-1}$, or an average
molecular gas density $\rho_\mathrm{H_2}$ in regions of the universe containing
a quasar of $\leq 2.02\times10^8$ M$_\odot$ cMpc$^{-3}$. The $L'_\mathrm{CO}$
upper limit falls among CO line luminosities obtained from
individually-targeted quasars in the COMAP redshift range, and the
$\rho_\mathrm{H_2}$ value is comparable to upper limits obtained from other
Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) surveys and their joint analyses. Further, we
forecast the values obtainable with the COMAP/eBOSS stack after the full 5-year

method, depending on the CO properties of the quasar sample. Based on these
achieved sensitivities, we believe that this technique of stacking LIM data on

we observe that highly complex, state-of-the-art ML models are prone to learn
physically implausible strategies. Consequently, we compare several measures to
ensure physically reasonable model behaviour. Lastly, we propose the
utilization of XAI in the context of wind turbine performance monitoring, by
disentangling environmental and technical effects that cause deviations from an

  Industrial Case Study","11 pages",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Context: Task interdependence is a work design factor that expresses the
mutual dependency between tasks that compose a whole work. In software
development, task interdependencies are created by the technical dependencies
between the components of the software system and by how the development tasks
are allocated to individuals in a teamwork context. Despite its importance for
individual and team effectiveness, we still do not have studies about how
software engineers perceive task interdependence in practice. Goal: To
understand the perceptions of software engineers about the interdependence in
their work and how these perceptions interact with other human and technical
factors in the development process. Method: We performed an exploratory
qualitative case study of a single software development team in a Brazilian
software company that developed solutions for the financial market. We
interviewed all 10 team members and used standard coding techniques from
qualitative research to code, categorize, and synthesize data. Results:
Individuals are consistent in their understanding of task interdependence and
how it happens in practice. However, there are asymmetries between the
individual perceptions in an interdependence relationship, which seem to
exacerbate expressed feelings of anxiety and dissatisfaction. Conclusion: Our
results suggest that the perception of task interdependence in software
development is often not symmetrical with potential negative effects on
emotional states that are related to motivation and satisfaction in the
workplace.

the cost of decreased safety guarantees. Recently, neural networks have also
been used to characterize safety through the use of barrier functions for
complex nonlinear systems. Learned barrier functions approximately encode and
enforce a desired safety constraint through a value function, but do not
provide any formal guarantees. In this paper, we propose a local dynamic
programming (DP) based approach to ""patch"" an almost-safe learned barrier at
potentially unsafe points in the state space. This algorithm, HJ-Patch, obtains
a novel barrier that provides formal safety guarantees, yet retains the global
structure of the learned barrier. Our local DP based reachability algorithm,
HJ-Patch, updates the barrier function ""minimally"" at points that both (a)
neighbor the barrier safety boundary and (b) do not satisfy the safety
condition. We view this as a key step to bridging the gap between
learning-based barrier functions and Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis,
providing a framework for further integration of these approaches. We
demonstrate that for well-trained barriers we reduce the computational load by
2 orders of magnitude with respect to standard DP-based reachability, and
demonstrate scalability to a 6-dimensional system, which is at the limit of
standard DP-based reachability.

fails catastrophically in others. Ideally, RL theory should be able to provide
an understanding of why this is, i.e. bounds predictive of practical

compare standard deep RL algorithms to prior sample complexity prior bounds by
introducing a new dataset, BRIDGE. It consists of 155 MDPs from common deep RL
benchmarks, along with their corresponding tabular representations, which
enables us to exactly compute instance-dependent bounds. We find that prior
bounds do not correlate well with when deep RL succeeds vs. fails, but discover
a surprising property that does. When actions with the highest Q-values under
the random policy also have the highest Q-values under the optimal policy, deep
RL tends to succeed; when they don't, deep RL tends to fail. We generalize this
property into a new complexity measure of an MDP that we call the effective
horizon, which roughly corresponds to how many steps of lookahead search are
needed in order to identify the next optimal action when leaf nodes are
evaluated with random rollouts. Using BRIDGE, we show that the effective
horizon-based bounds are more closely reflective of the empirical performance
of PPO and DQN than prior sample complexity bounds across four metrics. We also
show that, unlike existing bounds, the effective horizon can predict the
effects of using reward shaping or a pre-trained exploration policy.

This method enables local models to be tailored to their respective data

Moreover, it allows for more compact models that consume less data during

influenced by the ``feedback'' from supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Feedback
can drive turbulence in the ICM and turbulent dissipation can potentially be an
important source of heating. Due to the limited spatial and spectral
resolutions of X-ray telescopes, direct observations of turbulence in the hot
ICM have been challenging. Recently, we developed a new method to measure
turbulence in the ICM using multiphase filaments as tracers. These filaments
are ubiquitous in cluster centers and can be observed at very high resolution
using optical and radio telescopes. We study the kinematics of the filaments by
measuring their velocity structure functions (VSFs) over a wide range of scales
in the centers of $\sim 10$ galaxy clusters. We find features of the VSFs that
correlate with the SMBHs activities, suggesting that SMBHs are the main driver
of gas motions in the centers of galaxy clusters. In all systems, the VSF is
steeper than the classical Kolmogorov expectation and the slopes vary from
system to system. One theoretical explanation is that the VSFs we have measured
so far mostly reflect the motion of the driver (jets and bubbles) rather than
the cascade of turbulence. We show that in Abell 1795, the VSF of the outer
filaments far from the SMBH flattens on small scales to a Kolmogorov slope,
suggesting that the cascade is only detectable farther out with the current
telescope resolution. The level of turbulent heating computed at small scales
is typically an order of magnitude lower than that estimated at the driving
scale. Even though SMBH feedback heavily influences the kinematics of the ICM
in cluster centers, the level of turbulence it drives is rather low, and
turbulent heating can only offset $\lesssim10\%$ of the cooling loss,
consistent with the findings of numerical simulations.

limiting conduction, but magnetic fields act to dampen instabilities and slow
the stretching of the cloud in the flow direction. In the parallel case,

evolving the planetary orbit. For RGB stars, as well as AGB stars with $M_{\rm

is that black holes are effective generators of computational pseudorandomness,

duality operators and defects, which enriches ordinary Ising fusion rules with
subsystem features. Subsystem Kramers-Wannier duality defects are mobile in
both spatial directions, unlike the defects of invertible subsystem symmetries.
We finally comment on the anomaly of the subsystem Kramers-Wannier duality
symmetry, and discuss its subtleties.

In the minimal setup, the muon $g-2$ anomaly can be accommodated by the type-X

($\mu$2HDM), and $\mu\tau$-flavor violating 2HDM. We summarize all relevant
experimental constraints from high-energy collider experiments and flavor
experiments, as well as the theoretical constraints from the perturbative
unitarity and vacuum stability bounds, to these 2HDMs in light of the muon
$g-2$ anomaly. We clarify the available parameter spaces of these 2HDMs and
investigate how to probe the remaining parameter regions in future experiments.
In particular, we find that, due to the updated $B_s\to\mu^+ \mu^-$
measurement, the remaining parameter region of the FA2HDM is almost equivalent
to the one of the type-X 2HDM. Furthermore, based on collider simulations, we
find that the type-X 2HDM and $\mu$2HDM scenarios will be covered with the LHC

been limited by the wavelengths accessible by ground-based telescopes. The
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now offers the opportunity to probe this
emission deep into the reionization epoch. We report the observations of eight
quasars at $z>6.5$ using the JWST/NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy, as a
part of the ''A SPectroscopic survey of biased halos In the Reionization Era

frame $\sim$ 4100 and 5100 \r{A}. The profiles of these quasars' broad H$\beta$
emission lines span a FWHM from 3000 to 6000 $\rm{km~s^{-1}}$. The
H$\beta$-based virial black hole (BH) masses, ranging from 0.6 to 2.1 billion
solar masses, are generally consistent with their MgII-based BH masses. The new
measurements based on the more reliable H$\beta$ tracer thus confirm the
existence of billion solar-mass BHs in the reionization epoch. In the observed
[OIII] $\lambda\lambda$4960,5008 doublets of these luminous quasars, broad
components are more common than narrow core components
($\le~1200~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$), and only one quasar shows stronger narrow
components than broad. Two quasars exhibit significantly broad and blueshifted
[OIII] emission, thought to trace galactic-scale outflows, with median
velocities of $-610~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ and $-1430~\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ relative to the
[CII] $158\,\mu$m line. All eight quasars show strong optical FeII emission,
and follow the Eigenvector 1 relations defined by low-redshift quasars. The
entire ASPIRE program will eventually cover 25 quasars and provide a
statistical sample for the studies of the BHs and quasar spectral properties.

time in the detector frequency band. As a result, the effects caused by the
rotation of the Earth become increasingly important for such signals.
Additionally, the length of the arms of these detectors can be comparable to
the wavelength of detectable gravitational waves, which introduces
frequency-dependent effects that are not significant in current-generation
detectors. These effects are expected to improve the ability to localize
compact binary coalescences in the sky even when using only one detector. This
study aims to understand how much these effects can help in localization. We
present the first comprehensive Bayesian parameter estimation framework that
accounts for all these effects using \textsc{Bilby}, a commonly used Bayesian
parameter estimation tool. We focus on sky localization constraints for binary
neutron star events with an optimal signal-to-noise ratio of 1000 with one

radiative envelopes, the spin angular momentum of the host star is greater than
the planetary orbital angular momentum. In this case, the orbits of the planets
will undergo nodal precession, which can significantly impact the probability
that the planets transit their parent star. In particular, for some
combinations of the spin-orbit angle $\psi$ and the inclination of the stellar
spin $i_*$, all such planets will eventually transit at some point over the
duration of their precession period. Thus, as the time over which the sky has
been monitored for transiting planets increases, the frequency of planets with
detectable transits will increase, potentially leading to biased estimates of
exoplanet occurrence rates, especially orbiting more massive stars.
Furthermore, due to the dependence of the precession period on orbital
parameters such as spin-orbit misalignment, the observed distributions of such
parameters may also be biased. We derive the transit probability of a given
exoplanet in the presence of nodal precession induced by a rapidly spinning
host star. We find that the effect of nodal precession has already started to
become relevant for some short-period planets, i.e., Hot Jupiters, orbiting
massive stars, by increasing transit probabilities by of order a few percent
for such systems within the original $Kepler$ field. We additionally derive
simple expressions to describe the time evolution of the impact parameter $b$
for applicable systems, which should aid in future investigations of exoplanet
nodal precession and spin-orbit alignment.

across a localisation transition in non-Hermitian quantum systems. As a
concrete setting, we consider non-Hermitian power-law banded random matrices
which have emerged as a promising platform for studying localisation in
disordered, non-Hermitian systems. We show that eigenvector correlations show
marked differences between the delocalised and localised phases. In the
delocalised phase, the eigenvectors are strongly correlated as evinced by
divergent correlations in the limit of vanishingly small complex eigenvalue
spacings. On the contrary, in the localised phase, the correlations are
independent of the eigenvalue spacings. We explain our results in the
delocalised phase by appealing to the Ginibre random matrix ensemble. On the
other hand, in the localised phase, an analytical treatment sheds light on the
suppressed correlations, relative to the delocalised phase. Given that
eigenvector correlations are fundamental ingredients towards understanding
real- and imaginary-time dynamics with non-Hermitian generators, our results
open a new avenue for characterising dynamical phases in non-Hermitian quantum

imaging and spectroscopic survey of 25 reionization-era quasars and their
environments by utilizing the unprecedented capabilities of NIRCam Wide Field
Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS) mode. ASPIRE will deliver the largest
($\sim280~{\rm arcmin}^2$) galaxy redshift survey at 3-4 $\mu$m among JWST
Cycle-1 programs and provide extensive legacy values for studying the formation
of the earliest supermassive black holes (SMBHs), the assembly of galaxies,
early metal enrichment, and cosmic reionization. In this first ASPIRE paper, we
report the discovery of a filamentary structure traced by the luminous quasar
J0305-3150 and ten [OIII] emitters at $z=6.6$. This structure has a 3D galaxy
overdensity of $\delta_{\rm gal}=12.6$ over 637 cMpc$^3$, one of the most
overdense structures known in the early universe, and could eventually evolve
into a massive galaxy cluster. Together with existing VLT/MUSE and ALMA
observations of this field, our JWST observations reveal that J0305-3150 traces
a complex environment where both UV-bright and dusty galaxies are present, and
indicate that the early evolution of galaxies around the quasar is not
simultaneous. In addition, we discovered 31 [OIII] emitters in this field at
other redshifts, $5.3<z<6.7$, with half of them situated at $z\sim5.4$ and
$z\sim6.2$. This indicates that star-forming galaxies, such as [OIII] emitters,
are generally clustered at high redshifts. These discoveries demonstrate the
unparalleled redshift survey capabilities of NIRCam WFSS and the potential of
the full ASPIRE survey dataset.

light and which interacts with known matter primarily or only through gravity,
is one of the principal quests in physics. Leading candidates for DM are weakly
interacting massive particles (WIMPs) or ultralight bosons (axions), at
opposite extremes in mass scales, that have been postulated by competing
theories to solve deficiencies in the Standard Model of particle physics.
Whereas DM WIMPs behave like discrete particles ($\varrho$DM), quantum
interference between DM axions is manifested as waves ($\psi$DM). Here, we show
that gravitational lensing leaves signatures in multiply-lensed images of
background galaxies that reveal whether the foreground lensing galaxy inhabits
a $\varrho$DM or $\psi$DM halo. Whereas $\varrho$DM lens models leave well
documented anomalies between the predicted and observed brightnesses and
positions of multiply-lensed images, $\psi$DM lens models correctly predict the
level of anomalies left over by $\varrho$DM lens models. More challengingly,
when subjected to a battery of tests for reproducing the quadruply-lensed
triplet images in the system HS 0810+2554, $\psi$DM is able to reproduce all
aspects of this system whereas $\varrho$DM often fails. The growing success of
$\psi$DM in reproducing astrophysical observations tilt the balance toward new
physics invoking axions.

angular momentum to their magnetized winds, a process known as magnetic
braking. Recent observations suggest a substantial decrease in the magnetic
braking efficiency when stars reach a critical value of the Rossby number, the
stellar rotation period normalized by the convective overturn timescale. Cooler
stars have deeper convection zones with longer overturn times, reaching this
critical Rossby number at slower rotation rates. The nature and timing of the
transition to weakened magnetic braking has previously been constrained by
several solar analogs and two slightly hotter stars. In this Letter, we derive
the first direct constraints from stars cooler than the Sun. We present new
spectropolarimetry of the old G8 dwarf $\tau$ Cet from the Large Binocular
Telescope, and we reanalyze a published Zeeman Doppler image of the younger G8
star 61 UMa, yielding the large-scale magnetic field strengths and
morphologies. We estimate mass-loss rates using archival X-ray observations and
inferences from Ly$\alpha$ measurements, and we adopt other stellar properties
from asteroseismology and spectral energy distribution fitting. The resulting
calculations of the wind braking torque demonstrate that the rate of angular
momentum loss drops by a factor of 300 between the ages of these two stars

with a hot phase in galactic winds, yet the ablation time of cold gas by the

showed efficient radiative cooling enables clouds to survive in hot galactic
winds, as can magnetic fields even in purely adiabatic simulations for
sufficiently small density contrasts between the wind and cloud. In this work,
we study the interplay between radiative cooling and magnetic draping via three
dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We find magnetic fields
decrease the critical cloud radius for survival by two orders of magnitude
(i.e., to sub-pc scales) in the strongly magnetized ($\beta_{\rm wind}=1$)
case. Our results show magnetic fields (i) accelerate cloud entrainment through
magnetic draping, (ii) can cause faster cloud destruction in cases of
inefficient radiative cooling, (iii) do not significantly suppress mass growth
for efficiently cooling clouds, and, crucially, in combination with radiative
cooling (iv) reduce the average overdensity by providing non-thermal pressure
support of the cold gas. This substantially reduces the acceleration time
compared to the destruction time (more than due to draping alone), enhancing
cloud survival. Our results may help to explain the cold, tiny, rapidly

gradient along the disk major axis ($0.043\pm0.021$ dex/kpc). This gradient is
the result of changing light contributions from the metal-poor bulge and
metal-rich disk. The chemodynamics of stellar populations encodes information
about a galaxy's chemical enrichment, star formation history, and merger
history, allowing us to discuss new constraints on M31's formation. Our results

Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).
  Aims. We aim to determine variability parameters for objects in the Palomar
Transient Factory (PTF) and explore differences between quasars (QSOs), stars
and galaxies. We will relate variability and colour information in preparation
for future surveys.
  Methods. We fit joint likelihoods to structure functions (SFs) of 71 million
PTF lightcurves with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. For each object, we
assume a power law SF and extract two parameters: the amplitude on timescales
of one year, $A$, and a power law index, $\gamma$. With these parameters and
colours in the optical (Pan-STARRS1) and mid infrared (WISE), we identify
regions of parameter space dominated by different types of spectroscopically
confirmed objects from SDSS. Candidate QSOs, stars and galaxies are selected to
show their parameter distributions.
  Results. QSOs have high amplitude variations in the $R$ band, and the
strongest timescale dependence of variability. Galaxies have a broader range of
amplitudes and low timescale dependency. With variability and colours, we
achieve a photometric selection purity of 99.3 % for QSOs. Even though hard
cuts in monochromatic variability alone are not as effective as seven-band
magnitude cuts, variability is useful in characterising object sub-classes.
Through variability, we also find QSOs that were erroneously classified as
stars in the SDSS. We discuss perspectives and computational solutions in view
of the upcoming LSST.

In this work, we search for active dwarf galaxies in the recently completed

is currently the largest medium-depth X-ray survey covering 13 $\mathrm{deg}^2$
in three extragalactic fields, which all have well-characterized

to misidentifications, we identify 73 active dwarf galaxies at $z<1$, which
constitutes the currently largest X-ray-selected sample beyond the local
universe. Our sources are generally less obscured than predictions based on the
massive-AGN (active galactic nucleus) X-ray luminosity function and have a low
radio-excess fraction. We find that our sources reside in similar environments
to inactive dwarf galaxies. We further quantify the accretion distribution of
the dwarf-galaxy population after considering various selection effects and
find that it decreases with X-ray luminosity, but redshift evolution cannot be
statistically confirmed. Depending upon how we define an AGN, the active
fraction may or may not show a strong dependence on stellar mass. Their
Eddington ratios and X-ray bolometric corrections significantly deviate from
the expected relation, which is likely caused by several large underlying
systematic biases when estimating the relevant parameters for dwarf galaxies.
Throughout this work, we also highlight problems in reliably measuring
photometric redshifts and overcoming strong selection effects for distant
active dwarf galaxies.

  Results. We achieve highly accurate predictions for 71 million sources with

spectroscopically confirmed quasars from the SDSS with a purity of 95.64 %.
With only variability, the completeness is 34.97 % and the purity is 58.71 %

associated with multidimensional integrals describing collision processes.
Here, we present a method to resolve this bottleneck, enabling efficient study
of the linear response of a broad class of quantum many-body systems whose
behavior can be described using a Boltzmann equation. Specifically, we
demonstrate that a Gaussian mixture model can accurately represent equilibrium
distribution functions and, when combined with the variational method of

apply this method to investigate the collective behavior of a quantum
Bose-Fermi mixture of cold atoms in a cigar-shaped trap, focusing on monopole
and quadrupole collective modes above the Bose-Einstein transition temperature.
We find a rich phenomenology that spans interference effects between bosonic

hydrodynamics in various parameter regimes. Typical spectral functions exhibit
Fano interference profiles, systems with dilute fermions manifest behavior
reminiscent of Bose polarons, and systems with comparable bosonic and fermionic
densities display hallmarks of hydrodynamics such as mode-locking. These

explored the potential of the model for global application and compared its
performance using both synthetic and real data from different seismogenic

estimating earthquake magnitude from synthetic data. Comparable results were
observed in tests using synthetic data from a different tectonic region than

different regions and magnitudes, resulting in a good accuracy, provided that
the data from a particular group of stations had similar epicentral distance

remains a challenge, regardless of the strategies employed, whether manual,
automated, or a combination of the two. Many Christian organizations are
dedicated to the task of translating the Holy Bible into languages that lack a
modern translation. Bible translation (BT) work is currently underway for over
3000 extremely low resource languages. We introduce the eBible corpus: a
dataset containing 1009 translations of portions of the Bible with data in 833
different languages across 75 language families. In addition to a BT
benchmarking dataset, we introduce model performance benchmarks built on the No
Language Left Behind (NLLB) neural machine translation (NMT) models. Finally,
we describe several problems specific to the domain of BT and consider how the
established data and model benchmarks might be used for future translation
efforts. For a BT task trained with NLLB, Austronesian and Trans-New Guinea
language families achieve 35.1 and 31.6 BLEU scores respectively, which spurs
future innovations for NMT for low-resource languages in Papua New Guinea.

understanding of the underlying objective function and its implication for the

the POCS algorithms must operate in an inner-outer fashion (i.e., an inverse
problem is solved at each outer iteration). In light of our new theoretical
understanding, we suggest the use of a modern solver such as the Chambolle-Pock

checkers could return arbitrarily wrong results. Over the past decade,
different works derived stopping criteria, indicating when the precision
reaches the desired level, for various settings, in particular MDP with
reachability, total reward, and mean payoff, and SG with reachability.
  In this paper, we provide the first stopping criteria for VI on SG with total
reward and mean payoff, yielding the first anytime algorithms in these
settings. To this end, we provide the solution in two flavours: First through a
reduction to the MDP case and second directly on SG. The former is simpler and
automatically utilizes any advances on MDP. The latter allows for more local
computations, heading towards better practical efficiency.
  Our solution unifies the previously mentioned approaches for MDP and SG and

tissues, blood vessels or highly curved protrusions of other cells. Recent
\textit{in-vitro} experiments provide clear evidence that motile cells are
affected by the curvature of the substrate on which they migrate, preferring
certain curvatures to others, termed ``curvotaxis"". The origin and underlying
mechanism that gives rise to this curvature sensitivity are not well
understood. Here, we employ a ``minimal cell"" model which is composed of a
vesicle that contains curved membrane protein complexes, that exert protrusive
forces on the membrane (representing the pressure due to actin polymerization).
This minimal-cell model gives rise to spontaneous emergence of a motile
phenotype, driven by a lamellipodia-like leading edge. By systematically
screening the behaviour of this model on different types of curved substrates
(sinusoidal, cylinder and tube), we show that minimal ingredients and energy
terms capture the experimental data. The model recovers the observed migration
on the sinusoidal substrate, where cells move along the grooves (minima), while
avoiding motion along the ridges. In addition, the model predicts the tendency
of cells to migrate circumferentially on convex substrates and axially on
concave ones. Both of these predictions are verified experimentally, on several
cell types. Altogether, our results identify the minimization of
membrane-substrate adhesion energy and binding energy between the membrane
protein complexes as key players of curvotaxis in cell migration.

corresponding keypoints between images can be used to obtain the optimal
transformation via a differentiable closed-form expression. We use this
observation to drive the end-to-end learning of keypoints tailored for the
registration task, and without knowledge of ground-truth keypoints. This
framework not only leads to substantially more robust registration but also
yields better interpretability, since the keypoints reveal which parts of the
image are driving the final alignment. Moreover, KeyMorph can be designed to be
equivariant under image translations and/or symmetric with respect to the input
image ordering. Finally, we show how multiple deformation fields can be
computed efficiently and in closed-form at test time corresponding to different
transformation variants. We demonstrate the proposed framework in solving 3D

$\chi_{c0}\chi_{c0}$. The partial widths of these processes depend on strong
couplings $g_{i}$ at vertices $T_{\mathrm{4c} }J/\psi J/\psi $,
$T_{\mathrm{4c}}J/\psi \psi^{\prime} $ etc., which are computed using the QCD
three-point sum rule method. The decay $T_{\mathrm{4b} } \to \eta_{b}\eta_{b}$

compared with parameters of the fully charmed resonances reported by the LHCb,

remains limited comprehension of the characteristics differentiating fraudulent

genuine physician reviews differ. Our findings reveal significantly superior
performance of GPT-3 over traditional ML models in this context. Additionally,
our analysis suggests that GPT3 requires a smaller training sample than
traditional models, suggesting its appropriateness for tasks with scarce

cold start context i.e., when there are no prior reviews of a doctor. Finally,
we employ GPT4 to reveal the crucial dimensions that distinguish fake physician

obtained using simulated data, our findings from a real-world dataset show that
fake reviews are generally more clinically detailed, more reserved in

is first learned by our Defect Iterative Distribution Learning (DIDL) network
for a scene-independent segmentation. Then, the Stochastic Bayesian Refinement

binary mask generated by the DIDL network. Benefiting from the scene
independence of the temporal distribution and the accuracy improvement
resulting from the spatial correlation, the proposed approach performs well for
almost all videos from diverse and complex natural scenes with fixed

news is spread from a location in a network, followed by a correction to the
news. We assume that both the fake as well as correct news travel as
first-passage percolations or SI epidemics with i.i.d.\ traversal times,
possibly with different distributions and dependence.
  We make the (hopeful) assumption that once a vertex in the network hears the
correct news, they are immediately convinced that this is indeed correct, and
continue to spread the correct news. Even in this optimistic scenario, our main
results show that it is very difficult to remove the fake news from the
network, even when the correct news would spread much faster than the fake
news. We show this on the configuration model, a model that has gained enormous
popularity as a simple, yet flexible, model for real-world networks.
  The crux of the proof is the realization that this problem on a branching
process tree (which is known to be the local limit of the configuration model)
can be reformulated in terms of the maximum of a branching random walk, a topic
that has attracted considerable attention in the past decade. We then extend
the results to the graph setting using couplings to branching processes, local
convergence and detailed estimates on first-passage percolation on random
graphs as derived in \cite{BhaHofHoo17}. Remarkably, despite the fact that our
proofs for the configuration model rely on its local branching process
structure, the condition for strong survival on a finite number of generations
of a branching process tree is {\em different} from that on the configuration
model.

foreground models that can fit spectra down to $\sim 20$ mK or less,
representing a removal of power over nearly six orders of magnitude. Rarely are
such models tested to this level, let alone their dependence upon model inputs
like sky temperature maps. We therefore test the ability of seven commonly
employed foreground models -- including nonlinear and linear forward-models,
polynomials, and maximally-smooth polynomials -- to fit realistic simulated
mock spectra, as well as their dependence upon model inputs. The mock spectra
are synthesized from intrinsic foregrounds with realistic spatial and spectral
structure, chromatic beams, horizon profiles, and discrete time-sampling. For a
single LST bin spectrum, the nonlinear-forward model with 4 parameters is
preferred using a KS-test of the noise-normalized residuals, while the linear
forward-model fits well with 6-7 parameters. The polynomials and
maximally-smooth polynomials, like those employed by the EDGES and SARAS3
experiments, cannot produce good fits with 5 parameters. However, we find that
polynomials with 6 parameters pass the KS-test, although a 9 parameter fit
produces the highest p-value. When fitting multiple LST bins simultaneously to
decrease overlap with global signal models, we find that the linear
forward-model outperforms the nonlinear for 2, 5 and 10 LST bins. In addition,
the nonlinear forward-model fails to produce good fits to spectra with 10 LST
bins, in contrast to the linear. Importantly, the KS-test consistently
identifies best-fit \textit{and} preferred models as opposed to the
$\chi^2_{red}$ and Bayesian evidence, especially in cases involving nonlinear

offload the processing to an edge server. This paper examines how to speed up
the edge server DNN processing for multiple clients. In particular, we observe
batching multiple DNN requests significantly speeds up the processing time.
Based on this observation, we first design a novel scheduling algorithm to
exploit the batching benefits of all requests that run the same DNN. This is
compelling since there are only a handful of DNNs and many requests tend to use
the same DNN. Our algorithms are general and can support different objectives,
such as minimizing the completion time or maximizing the on-time ratio. We then
extend our algorithm to handle requests that use different DNNs with or without
shared layers. Finally, we develop a collaborative approach to further improve
performance by adaptively processing some of the requests or portions of the
requests locally at the clients. This is especially useful when the network

blockchain applications, and take the first step towards characterizing the
vulnerability of finitely-long blockchains in securing data against
double-spending attacks. For the first time, we develop a general closed-form
expression for the probability of success in launching a double-spending attack
on a finitely-long blockchain. This probability essentially characterizes the
vulnerability of finitely-long blockchains. Then, we prove that the probability
of success in launching a double-spending attack on a finitely-long blockchain
is no greater than that on an infinitely-long blockchain, which implies that
finitely-long blockchains are less vulnerable to double-spending attacks than
infinitely-long blockchains. Moreover, we show that unlike infinitely-long
blockchains which can be surely paralyzed by a 51% attack, finitely-long
blockchains are more resistant to 51% attacks.

``Learning-from-observation (LfO)'' that automatically generates robot programs
by observing human demonstrations. One of the main issues with introducing this
LfO system into the domain of household tasks is the cluttered environments,
which cause difficulty in determining which elements are important for task
execution when observing demonstrations. To overcome this issue, it is
necessary for the system to have common sense shared with the human
demonstrator. This paper addresses three relationships that LfO in the
household domain should focus on when observing demonstrations and proposes
representations to describe the common sense used by the demonstrator for
optimal execution of task sequences. Specifically, the paper proposes to use
labanotation to describe the postures between the environment and the robot,
contact-webs to describe the grasping methods between the robot and the tool,
and physical and semantic constraints to describe the motions between the tool
and the environment. Then, based on these representations, the paper formulates
task models, machine-independent robot programs, that indicate what to do and
how to do. Third, the paper explains the task encoder to obtain task models and
task decoder to execute the task models on the robot hardware. Finally, this
paper presents how the system actually works through several example scenes.

gradients in mass-to-luminosity ratio ($M/L$), $g-r$ color, and specific star
formation (SF) rate. We also calculate other metrics that quantify the
inside-out SF quenching and external mass growth processes. The $M/L$
gradients, $\nabla\Upsilon_{\star}$, are approximately flat at high look-back
times ($t_{\rm lb}$), but then they become negative and steeper until an epoch,
when this trend reverses. These trends are shifted to later epochs the less
massive the galaxies are. Color gradients follow qualitatively similar trends.
We find that these trends are mainly driven by strong inside-out quenching,
without significant outer growth or structural changes overall. Our results
suggest a scenario where the main progenitors of local CLE galaxies evolved
quasi-passively after an early dissipative phase, but underwent radial
photometric changes due to the inside-out quenching that led to the systematic
decrease of $\nabla\Upsilon_{\star}$ and to an increase of the light-weighted
radius. The late reversing of $\nabla\Upsilon_{\star}$, $t_{\rm lb}\approx2-4$
Gyr, roughly coincides with the global quenching of the CLE galaxies. We have
pushed archaeological inferences to the limit, but thanks to the large number
of objects and an understanding of how the caveats and assumptions affect our
results, we conclude that they offer an average description of evolutionary
behaviors of CLE progenitors that is valid at least qualitatively.

knots is observed in the HST images of the southeastern nucleus. These knots
coincide with star formation regions that along with the ring are predicted in

minor merger that was produced by the passing of the northern through the

mimics the combined effect of gravity and the sheath electric field typically

introduced in the medium by displacing a small central region of particles in
the vertical direction. The displaced particles start to oscillate in the
vertical direction, and their dynamics get modulated through a parametric decay
process. Consequently, beats generate in the vertical motion of the particles.
It has also been shown that the same motion is excited in the dynamics of
unperturbed particles as they are coupled via pair interactions. A simple
theoretical model is provided to understand the origin of the beat motions of
particles. Additionally, in our simulations, concentric circular wavefronts
propagating radially outward are observed on the surface of the monolayer. The

operate. These are complex distributions, and it is hard to get a real sense
for their dynamics using simplifications like average or median. One metric
that characterizes such distributions better is the Gini Index, which on one
extreme is 0, a completely equitable distribution, and on the other extreme is
1, the most inequitable, where a single individual has all the resources. Most
experts agree that viable economies cannot exist at either extreme, but
identifying a preferred range has historically been a matter of conflicting
political philosophies and emotional appeals. This research explores instead
whether there might be a theoretical and empirical basis for a preferred Gini
Index. Specifically, I explore a simple question: Before financial systems
existed, how were natural assets allocated? Intrinsic human attributes such as
height, strength, & beauty were the original measures of value in which human
social groups traded. Each of these attributes is distributed in a diverse and
characteristic way, which I propose has gradually established the acceptable
bounds of inequality through evolutionary psychology. I collect data for a wide
array of such traits and calculate a Gini Index for them in a novel way
assuming their magnitudes to be analogous to levels of financial wealth. The
values fall into a surprisingly intuitive pattern ranging from Gini=0.02 to
0.51. Income distributions in many countries are within the top half of this
range after taxes and transfers are applied (0.2 to 0.4). Wealth distributions
on the other hand are mostly outside of this range, with the United States at a
very inequitable 0.82. Additional research is needed on the interconnections
between this range of ""natural"" Gini Indexes and human contentment; and whether
any explicit policy goals should be considered to target them.

(VQA) tasks that require both vision and language processing, models with
bi-directional attention or models employing fusion techniques are often
employed to capture the context of multiple modalities all at once. As GPT does
not natively process vision tokens, to exploit the advancements in GPT models
for VQA in robotic surgery, we design an end-to-end trainable Language-Vision
GPT (LV-GPT) model that expands the GPT2 model to include vision input (image).
The proposed LV-GPT incorporates a feature extractor (vision tokenizer) and
vision token embedding (token type and pose). Given the limitations of
unidirectional attention in GPT models and their ability to generate coherent
long paragraphs, we carefully sequence the word tokens before vision tokens,
mimicking the human thought process of understanding the question to infer an

datasets to include question-type annotations to allow sub-type analysis.
Furthermore, we extensively study and present the effects of token sequencing,
token type and pose embedding for vision tokens in the LV-GPT model.

$2\times2$ games has an efficient two variable parameterization (a reduction

structure, has attracted a lot of attention in recent years as a main-memory
component in many NoSQL, cloud-based, and big data systems. Unlike the B-tree,
the skiplist does not need complex rebalancing mechanisms, but it still shows
expected logarithmic performance. It supports a variety of operations,
including insert, point read, and range queries. To make the skiplist more
versatile, many optimizations have been applied to its node structure,
construction algorithm, list structure, concurrent access, to name a few. Many
variants of the skiplist have been proposed and experimented with, in many
big-data system scenarios.
  In addition to being a main-memory component, the skiplist also serves as a
core index in systems to address problems including write amplification, write
stalls, sorting, range query processing, etc. In this tutorial, we present a
comprehensive overview of the skiplist, its variants, optimizations, and
various use cases of how big data and NoSQL systems make use of skiplists.
Throughout this tutorial, we demonstrate the advantages of using a skiplist or
skiplist-like structures in modern data systems.

trials with multiple target populations. In such trials, one treatment is
tested for its efficacy in each population. The PWER is defined as the
probability that a randomly selected, future patient will be exposed to an
inefficient treatment based on the study results. The PWER can be understood
and computed as an average of strata specific family-wise error rates and
involves the prevalences of these strata. A major issue of this concept is that
the population prevalences needed to determine this average are usually not
known in practice, so that the PWER cannot be directly controlled. Instead, one
could use an estimator of the prevalences based on the given sample, like their
maximum-likelihood estimator. In this paper we show in simulations that this
does not substantially inflate the true PWER. We differentiate between the
expected PWER, which is almost perfectly controlled, and study-specific values
of the PWER which are conditioned to given sample sizes and vary within a
narrow range. Thereby, we consider up to eight different overlapping patient
populations and moderate to large sample sizes.

which the model was developed included a mix of individuals with some who did
and others who did not initiate that treatment. By contrast, predictions under
hypothetical interventions are estimates of what a person's risk of an outcome
would be if they were to follow a particular treatment strategy, given their
individual characteristics. Such predictions can give important input to
medical decision making. However, evaluating predictive performance of
interventional predictions is challenging. Standard ways of evaluating
predictive performance do not apply, because prediction under interventions
involves obtaining predictions of the outcome under conditions that differ from
those that are observed for some patients in the validation data. This work
describes methods for evaluating predictive performance of predictions under
interventions using longitudinal observational data. We focus on time-to-event
outcomes and predictions under treatment strategies that involve sustaining a
particular treatment regime over time. We introduce a validation approach using
artificial censoring and inverse probability weighting which involves creating
a validation data set that mimics the particular treatment strategy under which
predictions are made. We extend measures of calibration, discrimination and
overall prediction error to the interventional prediction setting. The methods
are evaluated using a simulation study and results show that our proposed
approach and corresponding measures of predictive performance correctly capture
the true predictive performance. The methods are applied to an example in the
context of liver transplantation.

from their bulk counterparts. Indeed, confinement makes all physical properties
position-dependent and possibly anisotropic, and characterizing such spatial
variations and directionality is an intense area of focus in experimental and
computational studies of confined matter. While this task is fairly
straightforward for simple mechanical observables, it is far more daunting for
transport properties such as diffusivity that can only be estimated from
autocorrelations of mechanical observables. For instance, there are well
established methods for estimating diffusivity from experimentally observed or
computationally generated trajectories in the bulk. No rigorous generalizations
of such methods, however, exist for confined systems. In this work, we present
two filtered covariance estimators for computing anisotropic and
position-dependent diffusivity tensors and validate them by applying them to
stochastic trajectories generated according to known diffusivity profiles.
These estimators can accurately capture spatial variations spanning over
several orders of magnitude and assuming different functional forms. Our
approach is also very robust to implementation details such as the localization
function and time discretization and performs significantly better than
estimators that are solely based on local covariance. Moreover, the kernel
function does not have to be localized and can instead belong to a dictionary
of orthogonal functions. Therefore, the proposed estimator can be readily used
to obtain functional estimates of diffusivity rather than a tabulated
collection of pointwise estimates. Nonetheless, the susceptibility of the
proposed estimators to time discretization is higher close to hard boundaries.
We demonstrate this heightened susceptibility to be common among all
covariance-based estimators.

Horndeski gravity with the use of ray-tracing procedure and investigate the
optical appearances of the Horndeski hairy black hole surrounded by various
thin accretions. Firstly, we consider that the Horndeski hairy black hole is
illuminated by the optically and geometrically thin accretion disk. We
carefully clarify the contributions from the direct, lensed ring and photon
ring intensities to the total observed intensity via the transfer function,
which is rarely discussed in this scenario. We find that the Horndeski hair has
significant influences on both shadow size and distributions of direct, lensed
ring and photon ring brightness in three standard emission profiles. As a
result, the rings and images of Horndeski hairy black hole and the origination
of their brightness differentiate from those of Schwarzschild black hole (SBH)
when viewed in face-on orientation. Then, when the Horndeski hairy black hole
is illuminated by thin spherical accretions, the hairy black hole's shadow
surrounded by a bright ring is larger than that of SBH, but the brightness of
ring is fainter. Similar to that of SBH, the size of hairy black hole shadow
does not change as the radial moving of the spherical accretion, and the
brightness for the infalling accretion is fainter than that for the static
accretion due to the Doppler effect. Therefore, we argue that the black hole
image consisting of the shadow and accretion construction could, in theory,
reflect the observational differences between the Horndeski hairy black hole
and SBH.

effects within subpopulations characterized by the potential compliance
behavior. We derive the efficient influence functions for the principal natural
mediation effect estimands and motivate a set of multiply robust estimators for

efficient when all nuisance models are correctly specified. We further

acquire the exact location of only a constant number of objects (usually one)
per unit time, but for every other object, its set of potential locations,
called the object's uncertainty region, grows subject only to the speed limit.
As a result, the center of the objects may be at several possible locations,
called the center's uncertainty region. For each of these center problems, we
design query strategies to minimize the size of the center's uncertainty region
and compare its performance to an optimal query strategy that knows the
trajectories of the objects, but must still query to reduce their uncertainty.
For the static case of the 1-center problem in R^1, we show an algorithm that
queries four objects per unit time and works as well as the optimal algorithm
with one query per unit time. For the general case of the 1-center problem in
R^1, the centroid problem in R^d, and the 1-median problem in R^1, we prove
that the Round-robin scheduling algorithm is the best possible competitive

against adversarial patches that is resilient to realistic patch attacks. Jedi
tackles the patch localization problem from an information theory perspective;
leverages two new ideas: (1) it improves the identification of potential patch
regions using entropy analysis: we show that the entropy of adversarial patches
is high, even in naturalistic patches; and (2) it improves the localization of
adversarial patches, using an autoencoder that is able to complete patch
regions from high entropy kernels. Jedi achieves high-precision adversarial
patch localization, which we show is critical to successfully repair the
images. Since Jedi relies on an input entropy analysis, it is model-agnostic,
and can be applied on pre-trained off-the-shelf models without changes to the
training or inference of the protected models. Jedi detects on average 90% of
adversarial patches across different benchmarks and recovers up to 94% of
successful patch attacks (Compared to 75% and 65% for LGS and Jujutsu,

Ce sites in the unit cell, the so-called sub-lattice degrees of freedom owing

appearance of multiple SC phases even under an interaction inducing
spin-singlet superconductivity. CeRh$_2$As$_2$ is considered as the first

However, microscopic information about the SC states has not yet been reported.
In this study, we measured the SC spin susceptibility at two

various magnetic fields. Our experimental results strongly indicate a
spin-singlet state in both SC phases. In addition, the antiferromagnetic phase,

no sign of magnetic ordering in the HF SC phase. The present work reveals
unique SC properties originating from the locally noncentrosymmetric

proves that OOD detection actually is necessary for CIL. We first show that CIL

task-id prediction (TP). We then prove that TP is correlated with OOD

detection (or TP) are defined explicitly or implicitly by a CIL algorithm, good
WP and good OOD detection are necessary and sufficient conditions for good CIL,

particular). A good CIL algorithm based on our theory can naturally be used in
open world learning, which is able to perform both novelty/OOD detection and

Magnetohydrodynamic theory (Kennel et al., 1985,

Siscoe et al. 2006, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2005.02.102) claim of a
further 10x amplification of the interplanetary sheath fields has not been
verified in near-Earth interplanetary sheaths. The original (Tsurutani et al.,

cloud having southward magnetic fields of ~90 nT caused the Carrington magnetic
storm main phase of peak SYM-H/Dst = -1760 nT seems more likely. The short time

spatio-temporally conservative free space estimate enables robust detection of
moving objects without making any assumptions on the appearance of objects or
environments. This allows deployment in complex scenes such as multi-storied
buildings or staircases, and for diverse moving objects such as people carrying
various items, doors swinging or even balls rolling around. We thoroughly
evaluate our approach on real-world data sets, achieving 86% IoU at 17 FPS in
typical robotic settings. The method outperforms a recent appearance-based
classifier and approaches the performance of offline methods. We demonstrate
its generality on a novel data set with rare moving objects in complex

Besides model accuracy, other tuning intentions such as model training time and

hyperparameter auto-tuning. Towards this challenging target, we propose
HyperTuner in this paper. To address the formulated high-dimensional black-box
multi-objective optimization problem, HyperTuner first conducts multi-objective
parameter importance ranking with its MOPIR algorithm and then leverages the
proposed ADUMBO algorithm to find the Pareto-optimal configuration set. During
each iteration, ADUMBO selects the most promising configuration from the
generated Pareto candidate set via maximizing a new well-designed metric, which
can adaptively leverage the uncertainty as well as the predicted mean across
all the surrogate models along with the iteration times. We evaluate HyperTuner
on our local distributed TensorFlow cluster and experimental results show that
it is always able to find a better Pareto configuration front superior in both
convergence and diversity compared with the other four baseline algorithms.
Besides, experiments with different training datasets, different optimization
objectives and different machine learning platforms verify that HyperTuner can
well adapt to various data analytic service scenarios.

engineering and sciences. Recently there has been a great deal of interest in
quantifying the convergence behavior of the mixing measure, a fundamental
object that encapsulates all unknown parameters in a mixture distribution. In
this paper we propose a general framework for estimating the mixing measure
arising in finite mixture models, which we term minimum $\Phi$-distance
estimators. We establish a general theory for the minimum $\Phi$-distance
estimator, where sharp probability bounds are obtained on the estimation error
for the mixing measures in terms of the suprema of the associated empirical
processes for a suitably chosen function class $\Phi$.
  Our framework includes several existing and seemingly distinct estimation
methods as special cases but also motivates new estimators. For instance, it
extends the minimum Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance estimator to the multivariate
setting, and it extends the method of moments to cover a broader family of
probability kernels beyond the Gaussian. Moreover, it also includes methods
that are applicable to complex (e.g., non-Euclidean) observation domains, using
tools from reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. It will be shown that under
general conditions the methods achieve optimal rates of estimation under
Wasserstein metrics in either minimax or pointwise sense of convergence; the
latter case can be achieved when no upper bound on the finite number of

experiments is 500 based on the width of the bluff body and the freestream
velocity. The plasma actuators are installed on the top surface and the rear
surface of the square cylinder. The induced flow velocities of the plasma
actuators are modulated by adjusting the operating voltage and frequency of the

investigate the effect of using plasma actuators with different driving

successfully suppress flow separation and reduce the size of the recirculation

the drag coefficient and the operating voltage of the power generator is also

imposing voltage. The plasma actuators can enhance the momentum exchange and
the interactive behavior between the shear layer and the flow separation

slice providers is adopted. We aim to maximize the long-term average revenue of
the network operators through slice admission control, with the feasibility of

Extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate the efficacy of our

  A selection of $G_E^p$ parameterizations with known fit radius were
statistically sampled and fit with in both $Q^2$ and in $Z$. The mean and
variance of the extracted radii were compared to the input radius. The fits
were performed both with the parameters unbound and bound to study the effect
of choosing physically-motivated bounds. Additionally, the data are fit with
Rational(N,M) functions in $Q^2$ as used by the PRad collaboration.
  As expected, the results in both $Q^2$ and $Z$ were poor for unbounded
polynomials, with the fits in $Q^2$ showing a rather large bias with small
variance while the fits in $Z$ had a small bias with a large variance. The
application of bounds yield small improvements. In most cases, fits in $Q^2$
with Rational(N,M) type functions yielded improved results.
  We find that the $Z$-transformation technique is a useful tool, but not a
universal improvement over fitting in $Q^2$. The ""best"" technique was dependent
on the parameterization being fit and the $Q^2$ range of the data. The fits
with a Rational(N,M) function in $Q^2$ typically provided improved results over
other techniques when the data has sufficient $Q^2$ range, but provided
unphysical results when the range was too small. We conclude that any planned
fit should make use of psuedo data to determine the best basis and functional
form for a given data set. In the case of new experiments, this selection
should ideally be done prior to the collection of the data.

principled approaches to elevate the recognizability of a face in the embedding
space instead of the visual quality. We first formulate a robust learning-based
face recognizability measure, namely recognizability index (RI), based on two
criteria: (i) proximity of each face embedding against the unrecognizable faces
cluster center and (ii) closeness of each face embedding against its positive
and negative class prototypes. We then devise an index diversion loss to push
the hard-to-recognize face embedding with low RI away from unrecognizable faces
cluster to boost the RI, which reflects better recognizability. Additionally, a
perceptibility attention mechanism is introduced to attend to the most

  motion",,,,,"q-bio.QM physics.bio-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Coarse-grained descriptions of collective motion of flocking systems are
often derived for the macroscopic or the thermodynamic limit. However, many
real flocks are small sized (10 to 100 individuals), called the mesoscopic
scales, where stochasticity arising from the finite flock sizes is important.
Developing mesoscopic scale equations, typically in the form of stochastic
differential equations, can be challenging even for the simplest of the
collective motion models. Here, we take a novel data-driven equation learning
approach to construct the stochastic mesoscopic descriptions of a simple
self-propelled particle (SPP) model of collective motion. In our SPP model, a
focal individual can interact with k randomly chosen neighbours within an
interaction radius. We consider k = 1 (called stochastic pairwise
interactions), k = 2 (stochastic ternary interactions), and k equalling all
available neighbours within the interaction radius (equivalent to Vicsek-like
local averaging). The data-driven mesoscopic equations reveal that the
stochastic pairwise interaction model produces a novel form of collective
motion driven by a multiplicative noise term (hence termed, noise-induced
flocking). In contrast, for higher order interactions (k > 1), including
Vicsek-like averaging interactions, yield collective motion driven primarily by
the deterministic forces. We find that the relation between the parameters of
the mesoscopic equations describing the dynamics and the population size are
sensitive to the density and to the interaction radius, exhibiting deviations
from mean-field theoretical expectations. We provide semi-analytic arguments
potentially explaining these observed deviations. In summary, our study
emphasizes the importance of mesoscopic descriptions of flocking systems and
demonstrates the potential of the data-driven equation discovery methods for
complex systems studies.

\textit{multi-node representation learning}, where we are interested in
learning a representation for a set of more than one node such as a link.
Existing GNNs are mainly designed to learn single-node representations. When we
want to learn a node-set representation involving multiple nodes, a common
practice in previous works is to directly aggregate the single-node
representations obtained by a GNN. In this paper, we show a fundamental
limitation of such an approach, namely the inability to capture the dependence
among multiple nodes in a node set, and argue that directly aggregating
individual node representations fails to produce an effective joint
representation for multiple nodes. A straightforward solution is to distinguish
target nodes from others. Formalizing this idea, we propose \text{labeling
trick}, which first labels nodes in the graph according to their relationships
with the target node set before applying a GNN and then aggregates node
representations obtained in the labeled graph for multi-node representations.
The labeling trick also unifies a few previous successful works for multi-node
representation learning, including SEAL, Distance Encoding, ID-GNN, and NBFNet.
Besides node sets in graphs, we also extend labeling tricks to posets, subsets
and hypergraphs. Experiments verify that the labeling trick technique can boost
GNNs on various tasks, including undirected link prediction, directed link
prediction, hyperedge prediction, and subgraph prediction. Our work explains
the superior performance of previous node-labeling-based methods and

require collecting equal values, but not fully sorting the input, semisort is
broadly applicable, e.g., in string algorithms, graph analytics, and geometry
processing, among many other domains. However, despite dozens of recent papers

integer sorting in practice, due to potential performance issues in existing

hydraulic head-SP-MT data inversion can reasonably estimate hydraulic

through the aggregation of asymmetric U(1) dark fermions trapped within false
vacuum bubbles during a dark first order phase transition (FOPT). The PBH
formation scenario is mainly characterized by the dark asymmetry, strength of
the FOPT, rate of FOPT, and the percolation temperature. Meanwhile, for PBH
masses of interest lying within $10^{-10} M_\odot - 10^{-3}M_\odot$, the
relevant signal for PTA measurements is the Doppler phase shift in the timing
signal, due to the velocity change induced by transiting PBHs on pulsars.
Taking the dark asymmetry parameter to be $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-5}$, we find that
percolation temperatures within the 0.1-10 keV range, FOPT rates above $10^3$
times the Hubble parameter at percolation, and FOPT strengths within
$10^{-6}-0.1$ can give rise to PBHs that can be probed by an SKA-like PTA
observation. On the other hand, the accompanying gravitational wave (GW) signal
from the FOPT can be used as a complementary probe, assuming that the peak
frequency lies within the $\mathcal{O}(10^{-9})-\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ Hz range,
and the peak GW abundance is above the peak-integrated sensitivity curves
associated with pulsar timing observations that search for stochastic GWs. At
the fundamental level, a quartic effective potential for a dark scalar field

scheme, an electronic neural network encoder and a diffractive optical network
decoder are jointly trained using deep learning to transfer the optical
information or message of interest around the opaque occlusion of an arbitrary
shape. The diffractive decoder comprises successive spatially-engineered
passive surfaces that process optical information through light-matter
interactions. Following its training, the encoder-decoder pair can communicate
any arbitrary optical information around opaque occlusions, where information
decoding occurs at the speed of light propagation. For occlusions that change
their size and/or shape as a function of time, the encoder neural network can
be retrained to successfully communicate with the existing diffractive decoder,
without changing the physical layer(s) already deployed. We also validate this
framework experimentally in the terahertz spectrum using a 3D-printed
diffractive decoder to communicate around a fully opaque occlusion. Scalable
for operation in any wavelength regime, this scheme could be particularly
useful in emerging high data-rate free-space communication systems.

(ASR) systems are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs), which add a small
amount of noise to the original audio examples. These AE attacks pose new
challenges to deep learning security and have raised significant concerns about
deploying ASR systems and devices. The existing defense methods are either
limited in application or only defend on results, but not on process. In this
work, we propose a novel method to infer the adversary intent and discover
audio adversarial examples based on the AEs generation process. The insight of
this method is based on the observation: many existing audio AE attacks utilize
query-based methods, which means the adversary must send continuous and similar
queries to target ASR models during the audio AE generation process. Inspired
by this observation, We propose a memory mechanism by adopting audio
fingerprint technology to analyze the similarity of the current query with a
certain length of memory query. Thus, we can identify when a sequence of
queries appears to be suspectable to generate audio AEs. Through extensive
evaluation on four state-of-the-art audio AE attacks, we demonstrate that on
average our defense identify the adversary intent with over 90% accuracy. With
careful regard for robustness evaluations, we also analyze our proposed defense
and its strength to withstand two adaptive attacks. Finally, our scheme is
available out-of-the-box and directly compatible with any ensemble of ASR
defense models to uncover audio AE attacks effectively without model
retraining.

in academic and industrial applications, such as flexible electronics, soft

developing a simple and nondestructive peeling method for transferring and
reusing remains a big challenge. Here, we present an innovative detaching
approach for thin films: Electro-capillary peeling method. The
electro-capillary peeling method achieves thin films' detachment by driving
liquid to percolate and spread into the bonding layer under electric fields.
Compared with traditional methods, thin film detached by this novel peeling
mode shows a much lower deformation and strain of film (reaching 86%).
Evaluated by various applied voltages and films, the electro-capillary peeling
method shows active control characterizations and is appropriate in a broad
range of films. Theoretically, it is demonstrated that the electro-capillary
peeling method is actualized by utilizing Maxwell stress to compete with the
film's adhesive stress and tension stress. The peeling length versus time,
applied voltage, film's thickness, and elastic modulus are described by $r\sim
t$, $r \sim U$, $r\sim d_{0}^{-1/2}$, and $r\sim E^{-1/2}$, respectively.
Additionally, observations of critical peeling voltage present that the thin
film is readily detached by using the electro-capillary peeling method at the
ultra-low voltage of only 0.7 V. This work clearly shows the great potential of
electro-capillary peeling method to provide a new way for transferring films

geometries and various stacking configurations. Many prior works utilize pose
estimation for picking, but pose estimation is difficult on cluttered objects.
In this paper, we propose Cluttered Objects Descriptors (CODs), a dense
cluttered objects descriptor that can represent rich object structures, and use
the pre-trained CODs network along with its intermediate outputs to train a
picking policy. Additionally, we train the policy with reinforcement learning,
which enable the policy to learn picking without supervision. We conduct
experiments to demonstrate that our CODs is able to consistently represent seen
and unseen cluttered objects, which allowed for the picking policy to robustly
pick cluttered general objects. The resulting policy can pick 96.69% of unseen
objects in our experimental environment which is twice as cluttered as the
training scenarios.

rotational symmetries and time-reversal symmetry, constrains the amplitude and
phase of the photocurrent, thus manipulates the coherent processes in SHG. We
revisit the expression of photocurrent under the electric dipole approximation
and give a picture of non-equilibrium dynamical process of photoelectron on
laser-dressed effective bands. We reveal the indispensable role of shift vector
and transition dipole phase in the photocurrent coherence in addition to the
dynamical phase. Microscopic mechanism of the selection rule, orientation
dependence, polarization characteristics, time-frequency analysis and
ellipticity dependence of harmonics governed by crystal symmetry is clarified
analytically and numerically. The theory in this paper integrates
non-equilibrium electronic dynamics of condensed matter in strong laser fields,
and paves a way to explore more nonlinear optical phenomena induced by the
crystal symmetry.

including compressed sensing or sparse linear regression, machine learning with

hybrid method called Kaczmarz-based IHT (KZIHT) has been proposed, combining

this paper, we provide the first theoretical convergence guarantees for KZIHT
by showing that it converges linearly to the solution of a system with sparsity

each module can be trained efficiently in FT by stochastic algorithms without
distortion of graph information owing to its simplicity. To avoid the only
unidirectional information delivery of FT and sufficiently train shallow

makes the former modules perceive the latter modules. The backward training
introduces the reversed information delivery into the decoupled modules as well

greedy training affect the representational capacity, we theoretically prove
that the error produced by linear modules will not accumulate on unsupervised

interactions. In this paper, we investigate a possible observable consequence
of self-interacting dark matter: offsets between the central galaxy and the
center of mass of its parent halo. We examine 23 relaxed galaxy clusters in a
redshift range of 0.1 to 0.3 drawn from clusters in the Dark Energy Survey and
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey which have archival Chandra X-ray data of
sufficient depth for center and relaxation determination. We find that most
clusters in our sample show non-zero offsets between the X-ray center, taken to
be the centroid within the cluster core, and the central galaxy position. All
of the measured offsets are larger, typically by an order of magnitude, than
the uncertainty in the X-ray position due to Poisson noise. In all but six
clusters, the measured offsets are also larger than the estimated, combined
astrometric uncertainties in the X-ray and optical positions. A more
conservative cut on concentration to select relaxed clusters marginally reduces
but does not eliminate the observed offset. With our more conservative sample,
we find an estimated mean X-ray to central galaxy offset of $\mu = 5.5 \pm 1.0$
kpc. Comparing to recent simulations, this distribution of offsets is
consistent with some level of dark matter self interaction, though further
simulation work is needed to place constraints.

brightness using the radiative-transfer spectral-synthesis code tardis. We base
our modelling on literature delayed-detonation and deflagration models of
Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs, as well as the double-detonation models of
sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs. We present a new method for 'projecting'
abundance profiles to different density profiles for ease of computation. Due
to the small velocity extent and low outer densities of the W7 profile, we find
it inadequate to reproduce the evolution of SN 2021rhu as it fails to match the
high-velocity calcium components. The host extinction of SN 2021rhu is
uncertain but we use modelling with and without an extinction correction to set
lower and upper limits on the abundances of individual species. Comparing these
limits to literature models we conclude that the spectral evolution of SN
2021rhu is also incompatible with double-detonation scenarios, lying more in
line with those resulting from the delayed detonation mechanism (although there
are some discrepancies, in particular a larger titanium abundance in SN 2021rhu
compared to the literature). This suggests that SN 2021rhu is likely a lower
luminosity, and hence lower temperature, version of a normal SN Ia.

(DNNs), numerous works have been proposed to boost transferability to attack
real-world applications. However, existing attacks often utilize advanced
gradient calculation or input transformation but ignore the white-box model.
Inspired by the fact that DNNs are over-parameterized for superior performance,
we propose diversifying the high-level features (DHF) for more transferable
adversarial examples. In particular, DHF perturbs the high-level features by
randomly transforming the high-level features and mixing them with the feature
of benign samples when calculating the gradient at each iteration. Due to the
redundancy of parameters, such transformation does not affect the
classification performance but helps identify the invariant features across
different models, leading to much better transferability. Empirical evaluations
on ImageNet dataset show that DHF could effectively improve the transferability
of existing momentum-based attacks. Incorporated into the input
transformation-based attacks, DHF generates more transferable adversarial
examples and outperforms the baselines with a clear margin when attacking
several defense models, showing its generalization to various attacks and high
effectiveness for boosting transferability.

  The billiard map is known to have two different generating functions, which

the FirstLight simulations with the radiative transfer code POLARIS. The
starburst nature of these galaxies and their complex distribution of dust lead
to a large diversity of attenuation curves. These follow the Calzetti model
only for relatively massive galaxies, Mstars=10^9 Msun. Galaxies with lower
masses have steeper curves, consistent with the model for the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC). The ultraviolet and optical slopes of the attenuation curves are
closer to the modified Calzetti model, with a slight preference for the
power-law model for galaxies with the highest values of attenuation. We have
also examined the relation between the slope in the far-ultraviolet, beta_UV ,
and the infrared excess, IRX. At z=6, it follows the Calzetti model with a
shift to slightly lower beta_UV values due to lower metallicities at lower
attenuation. The same relation at z=8 shows a shift to higher IRX values due to
a stronger CMB radiation at high-z.

membership of unlabelled sample based on the class memberships of the K
labelled samples, the so-called nearest neighbors, that are closest to the
unlabelled sample. The choice of K has been the topic of various studies and
proposed KNN-variants. Yet no variant has been proven to outperform all other
variants. In this paper a new KNN-variant is proposed which ensures that the K
nearest neighbors are indeed close to the unlabelled sample and finds K along
the way. The proposed algorithm is tested and compared to the standard KNN in
theoretical scenarios and for indoor localization based on ion-mobility

the KNN in the tests, while requiring having the same computational demand.

fairness can be completely orthogonal. Next, we provide empirical evidence that

diagnostics and treatment planning. CBCT Imaging has a long acquisition time
and consequently, the patient is likely to move. This motion causes significant
artifacts in the reconstructed data which may lead to misdiagnosis. Existing
motion correction algorithms only address this issue partially, struggling with
inconsistencies due to truncation, accuracy, and execution speed. On the other
hand, a short-scan reconstruction using a subset of motion-free projections
with appropriate weighting methods can have a sufficient clinical image quality
for most diagnostic purposes. Therefore, a framework is used in this study to
extract the motion-free part of the scanned projections with which a clean
short-scan volume can be reconstructed without using correction algorithms.
Motion artifacts are detected using deep learning with a slice-based prediction
scheme followed by volume averaging to get the final result. A realistic motion
simulation strategy and data augmentation has been implemented to address data
scarcity. The framework has been validated by testing it with real
motion-affected data while the model was trained only with simulated motion

that their tokenizer is optimized for the language(s) it was pretrained on, but
brittle when it comes to previously unseen variations in the data. This can for
instance be observed when finetuning PLMs on one language and evaluating them
on data in a closely related language variety with no standardized orthography.
Despite the high linguistic similarity, tokenization no longer corresponds to
meaningful representations of the target data, leading to low performance in,
e.g., part-of-speech tagging.
  In this work, we finetune PLMs on seven languages from three different
families and analyze their zero-shot performance on closely related,
non-standardized varieties. We consider different measures for the divergence
in the tokenization of the source and target data, and the way they can be
adjusted by manipulating the tokenization during the finetuning step. Overall,
we find that the similarity between the percentage of words that get split into
subwords in the source and target data (the split word ratio difference) is the
strongest predictor for model performance on target data.

$N_i$'s or $W$.
  This paper considers a tandem network $$GI/G/1\rightarrow

light-tailed service times. The main result is that the tail $\P(W>x)$ has a
polynomial-exponential (Poly-Exp) structure by constructing upper bounds of the
form $$(a_{I}x^{I}+\dots+a_1x+a_0)e^{-\theta x}~.$$ The degree $I$ of the
polynomial depends on the number of bottleneck queues, their positions in the
tandem, and also on the `light-tailedness' of the service times. The bounds
hold in non-asymptotic regimes (i.e., for \textit{finite} $x$), are shown to be
sharp, and improve upon alternative results based on large deviations by (many)
orders of magnitude. The overall technique is also particularly robust as it

detached shells in the far-infrared, resembling rings or arcs. These structures
have long been interpreted as the bow shock formed in the interface between the
stellar wind and the interstellar medium, the astrosphere. To date, only a few
AGB stars have been observed showing an extended shell in the ultraviolet: the
cometary tail drifting away from $o$ Ceti, and a bubble around IRC+10216, CIT6,
and U Hya. This paper describes a search of UV extended shells around AGB stars
using archival GALEX far-UV images. After inspecting visually 282 GALEX images,
we identified the fourth discovery of a UV bubble around the AGB star R Dor.
The bubble is seen as a 26'x29' ring, corresponding to an actual diameter of
0.41x0.46 parsec$^2$. The mass of the thin UV bubble is estimated to be

order if feature importance is unknown, especially as an exhaustive search is
usually impractical. In this paper, we introduce Ranking Approaches for Unknown
Structures (RAUS), an automated framework to systematically inform variable
ordering and learn networks end-to-end. RAUS leverages existing statistical
methods (Cramers V, chi-squared test, and information gain) to compare variable
ordering, resultant generated network topologies, and DBN performance. RAUS
enables end-users with limited DBN expertise to implement models via command
line interface. We evaluate RAUS on the task of predicting impending acute
kidney injury (AKI) from inpatient clinical laboratory data. Longitudinal
observations from 67,460 patients were collected from our electronic health
record (EHR) and Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria were
then applied to define AKI events. RAUS learns multiple DBNs simultaneously to
predict a future AKI event at different time points (i.e., 24-, 48-, 72-hours
in advance of AKI). We also compared the results of the learned AKI prediction
models and variable orderings to baseline techniques (logistic regression,
random forests, and extreme gradient boosting). The DBNs generated by RAUS
achieved 73-83% area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCROC)
within 24-hours before AKI; and 71-79% AUCROC within 48-hours before AKI of any
stage in a 7-day observation window. Insights from this automated framework can
help efficiently implement and interpret DBNs for clinical decision support.

of the open-domain corpus. Contextual Masked Auto-Encoding has been proven
effective in representation bottleneck pre-training of a monolithic
dual-encoder for passage retrieval. Siamese or fully separated dual-encoders
are often adopted as basic retrieval architecture in the pre-training and
fine-tuning stages for encoding queries and passages into their latent
embedding spaces. However, simply sharing or separating the parameters of the
dual-encoder results in an imbalanced discrimination of the embedding spaces.
In this work, we propose to pre-train Contextual Masked Auto-Encoder with
Mixture-of-Textual-Experts (CoT-MoTE). Specifically, we incorporate
textual-specific experts for individually encoding the distinct properties of
queries and passages. Meanwhile, a shared self-attention layer is still kept
for unified attention modeling. Results on large-scale passage retrieval
benchmarks show steady improvement in retrieval performances. The quantitive
analysis also shows a more balanced discrimination of the latent embedding

composition methods are Feferman-Vaught-Mostowski (FVM) type theorems, which
characterize how logical equivalence behaves under composition and
transformation of models.
  Our results are developed by extending the recently introduced game comonad

parametric in the classes of models, logics and operations involved.
Furthermore, they naturally account for the positive existential fragment, and
extensions with counting quantifiers of these logics. We also reveal surprising
connections between FVM type theorems, and classical concepts in the theory of
monads.
  We illustrate our methods by recovering many classical theorems of practical
interest, including a refinement of a previous result by Dawar, Severini, and
Zapata concerning the 3-variable counting logic and cospectrality. To highlight
the importance of our techniques being parametric in the logic of interest, we
prove a family of FVM theorems for products of structures, uniformly in the
logic in question, which cannot be done using specific game arguments.

way of running a recommender system, because users now have the right to
withdraw their private data. Besides simply deleting the target data in the
database, unlearning the associated data lineage e.g., the learned personal
features and preferences in the model, is also necessary for data withdrawal.
Existing unlearning methods are mainly devised for generalized machine learning
models in classification tasks. In this paper, we first identify two main
disadvantages of directly applying existing unlearning methods in the context
of recommendation, i.e., (i) unsatisfactory efficiency for large-scale
recommendation models and (ii) destruction of collaboration across users and
items. To tackle the above issues, we propose an extra-efficient recommendation
unlearning method based on Selective and Collaborative Influence Function
(SCIF). Our proposed method can (i) avoid any kind of retraining which is
computationally prohibitive for large-scale systems, (ii) further enhance
efficiency by selectively updating user embedding and (iii) preserve the
collaboration across the remaining users and items. Furthermore, in order to
evaluate the unlearning completeness, we define a Membership Inference Oracle
(MIO), which can justify whether the unlearned data points were in the training
set of the model, i.e., whether a data point was completely unlearned.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed
method can not only greatly enhance unlearning efficiency, but also achieve
adequate unlearning completeness. More importantly, our proposed method
outperforms the state-of-the-art unlearning method regarding comprehensive
recommendation metrics.

successful transition to net-zero emissions in the manufacturing sector. Yet
there is no model to analyse technology adoption and the impact of policy
interventions in generating sufficient demand to reduce cost. Such a model is
vital for assessing policy-instruments for the implementation of future energy
scenarios. The design of successful policies for technology uptake becomes
increasingly difficult when associated market forces/factors are uncertain,
such as energy prices or technology efficiencies. In this paper we formulate a
novel robust market potential assessment problem under uncertainty, resulting
in policies that are immune to uncertain factors. We demonstrate two case
studies: the potential use of carbon capture and storage for iron and steel
production across the EU, and the transition to hydrogen from natural gas in
steam boilers across the chemicals industry in the UK. Each robust optimisation
problem is solved using an iterative cutting planes algorithm which enables
existing models to be solved under uncertainty. By taking advantage of
parallelisation we are able to solve the nonlinear robust market assessment
problem for technology adoption in times within the same order of magnitude as
the nominal problem. Policy makers often wish to trade-off certainty with
effectiveness of a solution. Therefore, we apply an approximation to chance
constraints, varying the amount of uncertainty to locate less certain but more
effective solutions. Our results demonstrate the possibility of locating robust
policies for the implementation of low-carbon technologies, as well as
providing direct insights for policy-makers into the decrease in policy
effectiveness resulting from increasing robustness. The approach we present is
extensible to a large number of policy design and alternative technology
adoption problems.

In this paper, we show that an almost simple group can have an element that is
a derangement in every faithful primitive action, and we call these elements

system and ultimately affect the safety of the whole IEGS. Hence, it is
necessary to accurately and efficiently evaluate the dynamic security region
(DSR) of the natural gas system in the IEGS by considering the real-time
dynamic characteristics of natural gas systems, which are not satisfactorily
handled in state-of-the-art works. To bridge this gap, this paper first
conceptionally verifies the necessity of the DSR and establishes its
mathematical model. Then, a dimensionality reduction method is proposed for the
efficient solution and visualization of the high-dimensional DSR evaluation
model. A fast evaluation (FE) algorithm is developed to address the
difficulties of the nonconvex dynamic constraints in the reduced DSR model.
Finally, the necessity and notable advantages of the proposed DSR model and FE
are verified based on small and relatively large test systems in comparison
with common security region models and algorithms. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first paper that comprehensively presents models and
efficient algorithms regarding the DSR of natural gas systems in an IEGS.

can reconcile a certain fraction of the teleported qubits to detect
eavesdropping or noise and decode the rest to use as a private key. Under the
present hardware infrastructure, decoherence of quantum states poses a
significant challenge to performing perfect or efficient teleportation, meaning
that a teleportation-based protocol must be run multiple times to observe
success. Thus, performance analyses of such protocols usually consider the
completion time, i.e., the time until success, rather than the duration of a
single attempt. Moreover, due to decoherence, the success of an attempt is in
general dependent on the duration of individual phases of that attempt, as
quantum states must wait in memory while the success or failure of a generation
phase is communicated to the relevant parties. In this work, we do a
performance analysis of the completion time of the BB84 protocol in a setting
where the sender and the receiver are connected via a single quantum repeater
and the only quantum channel between them does not see any adversarial attack.
Assuming certain distributional forms for the generation and communication
phases of teleportation, we provide a method to compute the MGF of the
completion time and subsequently derive an estimate of the CDF and a bound on
the tail probability. This result helps us gauge the (tail) behaviour of the
completion time in terms of the parameters characterising the elementary phases
of teleportation, without having to run the protocol multiple times. We also
provide an efficient simulation scheme to generate the completion time, which
relies on expressing the completion time in terms of aggregated teleportation
times. We numerically compare our approach with a full-scale simulation and
observe good agreement between them.

intents into their corresponding classes while identifying the new unknown
(open) intents, is an essential but challenging task in dialogue systems. In
this paper, we introduce novel K-center contrastive learning and adjustable
decision boundary learning (CLAB) to improve the effectiveness of open intent
classification. First, we pre-train a feature encoder on the labeled training
instances, which transfers knowledge from known intents to unknown intents.
Specifically, we devise a K-center contrastive learning algorithm to learn
discriminative and balanced intent features, improving the generalization of
the model for recognizing open intents. Second, we devise an adjustable
decision boundary learning method with expanding and shrinking (ADBES) to
determine the suitable decision conditions. Concretely, we learn a decision
boundary for each known intent class, which consists of a decision center and
the radius of the decision boundary. We then expand the radius of the decision
boundary to accommodate more in-class instances if the out-of-class instances
are far from the decision boundary; otherwise, we shrink the radius of the
decision boundary. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets clearly
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for open intent classification. For

typically much smaller than the self-interactions. We present numerical
simulations, with initial conditions where the halo is described by the WKB
approximation for its eigenfunction coefficients. We find that when the size of
the system is of the order of the Jeans length associated with the
self-interactions, a central soliton quickly forms and makes about 50% of the
total mass. However, if the halo is ten times greater than this
self-interaction scale, a soliton only quickly forms in cuspy halos where the
central density is large enough to trigger the self-interactions. If the halo
has a flat core, it takes a longer time for a soliton to appear, after small
random fluctuations on the de Broglie wavelength size build up to reach a large
enough density. In some cases, we observe the co-existence of several narrow
density spikes inside the larger self-interaction-supported soliton. All
solitons appear robust and slowly grow, unless they already make up 40% of the
total mass. We develop a kinetic theory, valid for an inhomogeneous background,
to estimate the soliton growth rate for low masses. It explains the fast
falloff of the growth rate as resonances between the ground state and halo
excited states disappear. Our results suggest that cosmological halos would

pressure-induced Mott transition from an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator to a
ferromagnetic Weyl metal in the iron oxychalcogenide La2O3Fe2Se2 occurs around
37 GPa without structural phase transition. Our theoretical calculations reveal
that such an insulator-metal transition is mainly due to the enlarged bandwidth
and diminishing of electron correlation at high pressure, fitting well with the
experimental data. Moreover, the high-pressure ferromagnetic Weyl metallic
phase possesses attractive electronic band structures with six pairs of Weyl
points close to the Fermi level, and its topological property can be easily
manipulated by the magnetic field. The emergence of Weyl fermions in
La2O3Fe2Se2 at high pressure may bridge the gap between nontrivial band

In particular, the diversity of image styles may be primarily attributed to the
vendor factor. However, the collection of mammograms from large and diverse
vendors is very expensive and sometimes impractical. Motivatedly, a novel
contrastive learning method is developed to equip the deep learning models with
better generalization capability. Specifically, the multi-style and multi-view
unsupervised self-learning scheme is carried out to seek robust feature
embedding against various vendor styles as a pre-trained model. Afterward, the
pre-trained network is further fine-tuned to the downstream tasks, e.g., mass
detection, matching, BI-RADS rating, and breast density classification. The
proposed method has been extensively and rigorously evaluated with mammograms
from various vendor-style domains and several public datasets. The experimental
results suggest that the proposed domain generalization method can effectively
improve the performance of four mammographic image tasks on data from either
seen or unseen domains and outperform many state-of-the-art (SOTA)

described in detail. CCGG emerges naturally in the Palatini formulation, where
the vierbein and the spin connection are independent fields. Neither torsion
nor non-metricity are excluded. The manifestly covariant gauge process is based
on canonical transformations in the De Donder-Weyl Hamiltonian formalism,
starting from a small number of basic postulates. Thereby, the original system
of matter fields in flat spacetime, represented by non-degenerate Hamiltonian
densities, is amended by spacetime fields. The coupling of matter and spacetime
fields leaves the action integral of the combined system invariant under active
local Lorentz transformations and passive diffeomorphisms, aka Principle of
General Relativity. We consider the Klein-Gordon, Maxwell-Proca, and Dirac
fields and derive the corresponding equations of motion. Albeit the coupling of
the given matter fields to the gauge fields are unambiguously determined by
CCGG, the dynamics of the free gauge fields must be postulated based on
physical reasoning. Our choice allows to derive Poisson-like equations of
motion also for curvature and torsion. The latter is proven to be totally
anti-symmetric. The affine connection is a function of the spin connection and
vierbein fields. Requesting the spin connection to be anti-symmetric gives
naturally metric compatibility. The canonical equations combine to an extension
of the Einstein-Hilbert action with a quadratic Riemann-Cartan concomitant that
endows spacetime with inertia. Moreover, a non-degenerate, quadratic version of
the free Dirac Lagrangian is deployed. When coupled to gravity, the Dirac
equation is endowed with an emergent mass parameter, a curvature-dependent mass
correction, and novel interactions between particle spin and spacetime torsion.

surface on which light from nearby sources can be reflected, observational
study of black hole physics requires observing the gravitational impact of the
black hole on its surroundings. A massive black hole leaves a dynamical imprint
on stars and gas close by. Gas in the immediate vicinity of an accreting
massive black hole can, due to the presence of the black hole, shine so
brightly that it outshines the light of the billions of stars in its host
galaxy and be detected across the Universe. By observing the emission from
stars and gas and determining their kinematics scientists can extract vital
information not only on the fundamental properties of the black holes
themselves but also the impact they have on their surroundings. As it turns
out, supermassive black holes appear to play a vital role in shaping the
Universe as we know it, as they can profoundly impact the star formation
history in galaxies. As a consequence, these black holes indirectly impact the
cosmic build up of chemical elements heavier than Helium and thus affect when
and where life can form. For these reasons alone, observations of massive black
holes constitute a very active research area of modern astrophysics.
  In this chapter we aim to provide a general overview -- fit for a non-expert
-- of what scientists have learned, and hope to learn, from analyzing
observations of massive black holes and the material around them.

for Video Quality Assessment VQA). Reduced reference video quality assessment
(RR-VQA) is a category of VQA where certain features (e.g., texture, edges) of
the original video are provided for quality assessment. It is a popular
research area for various applications such as social media, online games, and
video streaming. This paper introduces a reduced reference Transcoding Quality
Prediction Model (TQPM) to determine the visual quality score of the video
possibly transcoded in multiple stages. The quality is predicted using Discrete
Cosine Transform (DCT)-energy-based features of the video (i.e., the video's
brightness, spatial texture information, and temporal activity) and the target
bitrate representation of each transcoding stage. To do that, the problem is
formulated, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based quality prediction model
is presented. Experimental results illustrate that, on average, TQPM yields
PSNR, SSIM, and VMAF predictions with an R2 score of 0.83, 0.85, and 0.87,
respectively, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.31 dB, 1.19 dB, and 3.01,

0.86, and 0.91, respectively, and MAE of 1.32 dB, 1.33 dB, and 3.25,

average processing time of TQPM for 4s segments is 0.328s, making it a
practical VQA method in online streaming applications.

At deep subwavelength separations, quantum emitter arrays exhibit an
energetically broad manifold of collective states with delocalized electronic
excitations originating from near field dipole-dipole exchanges between the
aggregate's monomers. Photoexcitation with visible light addresses almost
exclusively symmetric collective states, which for an arrangement known as
H-aggregate, have the highest energies (hypsochromic shift). The extremely fast
subsequent non-radiative relaxation via intramolecular vibrational modes then
populates lower energy, subradiant states which results in the effective

achieve active control of the spin angular momentum of electrons in nanoscale

ferromagnetic materials and materials supporting spin texture suffer both from
conceptional limitations in miniaturization and in efficiency of optical and
electronic manipulation, non-magnetic centrosymmetric layered materials with
hidden spin polarization may offer an alternative pathway to manipulate the
spin degree of freedom by external stimuli. Here we demonstrate a novel
approach to generate transient spin polarization on a femtosecond timescale in
the otherwise spin-unpolarized band structure of the centrosymmetric 2H-stacked
group VI transition metal dichalcogenide WSe$_{2}$. Using ultrafast optical
excitation of a fullerene layer grown on top of WSe$_{2}$, we trigger an
ultrafast interlayer electron transfer from the fullerene layer into the
WSe$_{2}$ crystal. The resulting transient charging of the C$_{60}$/WSe$_{2}$
interface leads to a substantial interfacial electric field that by means of
spin-layer-valley locking ultimately creates ultrafast spin polarization
without the need of an external magnetic field. Our findings hence open a novel
pathway for optically engineering spin functionalities such as the
sub-picosecond generation and manipulation of ultrafast spin currents in 2D

Here, we propose to combine advanced manufacturing technologies with Origami
principles to create a new class of architectured cellular viscoelastic cushion
material which combines low weight and high energy absorption efficiency with
damage resistance and full behavior customization. Each unit cell in the
proposed material is inspired by the Kresling Origami topology, which absorbs
impact energy by gracefully folding the different interfaces forming the cell
to create axial and rotational motions. A large part of the absorbed energy is
then dissipated through viscoelasticity and friction between the interfaces.
The result is a nearly ideal cushion material exhibiting high energy absorbing
efficiency (around 70%) combined with high energy dissipation (94% of the
absorbed energy). The material is also tunable for optimal performance,
reliable despite successive impact events, and achieves full shape recovery.

reasoning about its future accuracy. Our approach, filter-aware MPC, penalises
the loss of information by what we call ""trackability"", the expected error of
the state estimator. We show that model-based simulation allows condensing
trackability into a neural network, which allows fast planning. In experiments

Several approaches for this task map images and texts into a common space to

(semantics) richness of an image, redundant secondary information in an image
may cause false matches. To address this issue, this paper presents a semantic
optimization approach, implemented as a Visual Semantic Loss (VSL), to assist
the model in focusing on an image's main content. This approach is inspired by
how people typically annotate the content of an image by describing its main
content. Thus, we leverage the annotated texts corresponding to an image to
assist the model in capturing the main content of the image, reducing the
negative impact of secondary content. Extensive experiments on two benchmark

resolve numerical fluxes across a partially obstructed interface. The
predictive capacity of the solver has been validated through comparisons with
experimental data collected from experiments conducted in a state-of-the-art

training a shared encoder to map images into a 3D generator's latent space or
by per-image latent code optimization and then edited images in the latent
space. Despite their promising results near the input view, they still suffer
from the 3D inconsistency of produced images at large camera poses and
imprecise image attribute editing, like affecting unspecified attributes during
editing. For more efficient image inversion, we train a shared encoder for all
images. To alleviate 3D inconsistency at large camera poses, we propose two
novel methods, an alternating training scheme and a multi-view identity loss,
to maintain 3D consistency and subject identity. As for imprecise image
editing, we attribute the problem to the gap between the latent space of real
images and that of generated images. We compare the latent space and inversion
manifold of GAN models and demonstrate that editing in the inversion manifold
can achieve better results in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
Extensive experiments show that our method produces more 3D consistent images

replication in NLP for RE. Concretely: (i) we report on hands-on experiences of
replication, (ii) we review the state-of-the-art and extract

challenges across two typical dimensions of replication: data annotation and
tool reconstruction. NLP for RE is a research area that is suitable for study
replication since it builds on automated tools which can be shared, and
quantitative evaluation that enable direct comparisons between results.
[Results] Replication is hampered by several factors, including the context
specificity of the studies, the heterogeneity of the tasks involving NLP, the
tasks' inherent hairiness, and, in turn, the heterogeneous reporting structure.

cache attacks are widely exploited and pose a significant privacy and

cache partitioning, randomization, and cache line flushing, which unfortunately
either incur high overhead or can be circumvented by sophisticated attacks. In
this paper, we propose a novel hardware-software co-design called BackCache
with the idea of always achieving cache hits instead of cache misses to
mitigate contention-based cache timing attacks on the L1 data cache. BackCache
places the evicted cache lines from the L1 data cache into a fully-associative
backup cache to hide the evictions. To improve the security of BackCache, we
introduce a randomly used replacement policy (RURP) and a dynamic backup cache
resizing mechanism. We also present a theoretical security analysis to

of articles devoted to an analysis of interior singularities of locally area
minimizing $n$-dimensional rectifiable currents $T$ of codimension $\geq 2$. In
the present article we establish a new height estimate for $T$, which says that
in a cylinder in the ambient space, the pointwise distance of $T$ to a union of
non-intersecting planes is bounded from above, in the interior, \emph{linearly}
by the $L^{2}$ height excess of $T$ relative to the same union of planes,
whenever appropriate smallness-of-excess conditions are satisfied. We use this
estimate and techniques inspired by the works \cite{Sim93}, \cite{Wic14},
\cite{KrumWic2} to establish a decay estimate for $T$ whenever, among other
requirements, $T$ is significantly closer to a union of planes meeting along an
$(n-2)$-dimensional subspace than to any single plane. Combined with
\cite[Theorem~1.1]{KrumWica}, this implies two main results: (a) $T$ has a
unique tangent cone at ${\mathcal H}^{n-2}$ a.e.\ point, and (b) the set of
singular points of $T$ where $T$, upon scaling, does not decay \emph{rapidly}
to a plane is countably $(n-2)$-rectifiable. In particular, concerning
\emph{branch points} of $T$, the work here and in \cite{KrumWica} establishes
the fact that rapid decay to a unique tangent plane is the generic behaviour,
in the sense that at ${\mathcal H}^{n-2}$ a.e.\ branch point, $T$ decays to a
unique tangent plane and has \emph{planar frequency} (or the order of contact
with the tangent plane) bounded below by $1 + \alpha$ for some fixed $\alpha
\in (0, 1)$ depending only on $n$, $m$ and a mass upper bound for $T$; the
planar frequency exists, is uniquely defined and is finite by the approximate
monotonicity of the (intrinsic) planar frequency function introduced in

desired. Most existing spike sorters work in an offline manner, i.e., sorting
after data collection. However, offline spike sorters usually suffer from
performance degradation in online tasks due to the instability of neural
signals. In an online process, neuronal properties can change over time (such
as waveform deformations), and new neurons can appear. Therefore, a static
spike sorter requires periodic recalibration to maintain its performance. This
study proposes a novel online spike sorter based on neuromorphic models
(NeuSort), which can adaptively adjust itself to cope with changes in neural
signals. NeuSort can robustly track individual neurons' activities against
waveform deformations and automatically recognize new coming neurons in
real-time. The adaptation ability of NeuSort is achieved by online parameter
updates of the neuromorphic model, according to the plasticity learning rule
inspired by biological neural systems. Experimental results on both synthetic

automatically and cope with non-stationary situations in neural signals.
NeuSort also provides ultra-low energy cost computation with neuromorphic

paper argues that three ideas can improve reinforcement learning methods even
for highly nonlinear set-point control problems: 1) Make use of a prior
feedback controller to aid amplitude exploration. 2) Use integrated errors. 3)
Train on model ensembles. Together these ideas lead to more efficient training,
and a trained set-point controller that is more robust to modelling errors and
thus can be directly deployed to real-world nonlinear systems. The claim is
supported by experiments with a real-world nonlinear cascaded tank process and
a simulated strongly nonlinear pH-control system.

  isotropic linear-elastic polycrystalline materials","10 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.class-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Intergranular normal stresses (INS) are critical in the initiation and
evolution of grain boundary damage in polycrystalline materials. To model the
effects of such microstructural damage on a macroscopic scale, knowledge of INS
is usually required statistically at each representative volume element
subjected to various loading conditions. However, calculating INS distributions
for different stress states can be time-consuming. This study proposes a new
method to extend existing INS distributions to arbitrary loading conditions
using the symmetries of isotropic linear-elastic polycrystalline materials. The
method relies on a fact that INS distributions can be accurately reproduced
from the first (typically) ten statistical moments, which depend trivially on
just two deviatoric-stress invariants and a few material invariants due to
assumed isotropy and linearity of the polycrystalline model. While these
material invariants are complex averages, they can be extracted numerically
from a few existing INS distributions and tabulated for later use. Practically,
only two such INS distributions at properly selected loadings are required to
provide all relevant material invariants for the first 11 statistical moments,
which can then be used to reconstruct the INS distribution for arbitrary
loading conditions. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be accurate and
feasible for an arbitrarily selected linear-elastic material under various
loading conditions.

be uniquely defined. A reasonable definition of mass for the Kerr-AdS black
hole has been found and widely used in studying black hole thermodynamics.
However, the derivation usually needs a background subtraction to eliminate the
divergence. It is also unknown whether this formula can be extended to a more
general form. In this paper, we provide a more straightforward derivation for
the mass formula, only demanding that the first law of black hole
thermodynamics and Smarr formula are satisfied. We first make use of the
Iyer-Wald formalism to derive a first law of charged Kerr-AdS black hole in the
extended phase space. However, this mass is obviously not integrable. We then
modify the coefficients of the first law to make the mass integrable. Finally,
by applying the scaling argument to the modified first law, we obtain the Smarr
formula, i.e., the explicit form of the mass. Remarkably, our mass formula
contains a free parameter and when it is set to zero, we recover the familiar
mass $M/\Xi^2$ in the literature. Moreover, by making use of the gauge freedom
of the Killing vector field $\ppa{t}{a}$, we find a favorite parameter $t'$
which just gives the first law and makes the mass integrable. The mass also
satisfies the Smarr formula and takes the form $M/\Xi^{3/2}$. To the best of
our knowledge, this is a new mass formula and could have important applications
in future studies.

Self-supervised learning (SSL) is treated as a solution to tackle the issue,

methods ignore leveraging the beneficial information from aliasing relations

generate the representation of the co-occurrence patterns in a generative
manner. Meanwhile, the representations of aliasing relations are learned to
enhance reasoning in the AR-assist mechanism. Besides, multiple strategies,
i.e., simple summation and learnable fusion, are offered for representation
fusion. Finally, the generated representation is used for scoring. Extensive

drone and aircraft surveys as well as satellites such as the TROPOspheric

spatially incomplete observations of methane can produce negatively biased
time-averaged regional emission rate estimates via the divergence method, but
that this effect can be counteracted by adopting a procedure in which daily
advective fluxes of methane are time-averaged before the divergence method is
applied. Using such a procedure with TROPOMI methane observations, we calculate
yearly Permian emission rates of 3.1, 2.4 and 2.7 million tonnes per year for
the years 2019 through 2021. We also show that highly-resolved plumes of
methane can have negatively biased estimated emission rates by the divergence
method due to the presence of turbulent diffusion in the plume, but this is
unlikely to affect regional methane emission budgets constructed from TROPOMI
observations of methane. The results from this work are expected to provide
useful guidance for future implementations of the divergence method for
emission rate estimation from satellite data - be it for methane or other

model performance usually inferior to the corresponding machine translation
(MT) model. Based on the above observation, existing methods often use
sharingmechanisms to carry out implicit knowledge transfer by imposing various
constraints. However, the final model often performs worse on the MT task than
the MT model trained alone, which means that the knowledge transfer ability of
this method is also limited. To deal with these problems, we propose the FCCL

adopt a simple whitening method to alleviate the representation degeneration in

is equivalent to measuring a three-point function of two CMB $B$-modes and an

tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, albeit with a simplistic foreground treatment, and
find constraints of $\sigma_r \simeq 7 \times 10^{-3}$ from the correlation of

Existing frame selection methods either individually sample frames based on
per-frame importance prediction, without considering interaction among frames,
or adopt reinforcement learning agents to find representative frames in
succession, which are costly to train and may lead to potential stability
issues. To overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose a
Search-Map-Search learning paradigm which combines the advantages of heuristic
search and supervised learning to select the best combination of frames from a
video as one entity. By combining search with learning, the proposed method can
better capture frame interactions while incurring a low inference overhead.
Specifically, we first propose a hierarchical search method conducted on each
training video to search for the optimal combination of frames with the lowest
error on the downstream task. A feature mapping function is then learned to map
the frames of a video to the representation of its target optimal frame
combination. During inference, another search is performed on an unseen video
to select a combination of frames whose feature representation is close to the
projected feature representation. Extensive experiments based on several action
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that our frame selection method effectively
improves performance of action recognition models, and significantly
outperforms a number of competitive baselines.

historically-popular method for representing graphics content: vegetation,
buildings, textures, etc. They offer many advantages: interpretable design
parameters, stochastic variations, high-quality outputs, compact
representation, and more. But they also have some limitations, such as the
difficulty of authoring a procedural model from scratch. More recently,
AI-based methods, and especially neural networks, have become popular for
creating graphic content. These techniques allow users to directly specify
desired properties of the artifact they want to create (via examples,
constraints, or objectives), while a search, optimization, or learning
algorithm takes care of the details. However, this ease of use comes at a cost,
as it's often hard to interpret or manipulate these representations. In this
state-of-the-art report, we summarize research on neurosymbolic models in
computer graphics: methods that combine the strengths of both AI and symbolic
programs to represent, generate, and manipulate visual data. We survey recent
work applying these techniques to represent 2D shapes, 3D shapes, and materials
& textures. Along the way, we situate each prior work in a unified design space

drops part of the embedding dimensions. In this way, the semantic information

meaningful featureswith a certain number of embedding dimensions erased.

technique due to its high array gain and low power. However, the traditional
passive RIS suffers from the ``double fading'' effect, which has restricted the
performance of passive RIS-aided communications. Fortunately, active RIS can
alleviate this problem since it can adjust the phase shift and amplify the
received signal simultaneously. Nevertheless, a high beamforming gain often
requires a number of reflecting elements, which leads to non-negligible power
consumption, especially for the active RIS. Thus, one challenge is how to
improve the scalability of the RIS and the energy efficiency. Different from
the existing works where all reflecting elements are activated, we propose a
novel element on-off mechanism where reflecting elements can be flexibly
activated and deactivated. Two different optimization problems for passive RIS
and active RIS are formulated by maximizing the total energy efficiency. We
develop two different alternating optimization-based iterative algorithms to
obtain sub-optimal solutions. Furthermore, we consider special cases involving
rate maximization problems for given the same total power budget, and
respectively analyze the number configuration for passive RIS and active RIS.
Simulation results verify that reflecting elements under the proposed

tested LLVM vectorisation with vector length agnostic and specific settings,

we first mask random patches of the background-excluded document images and
then reconstruct the missing pixels. With such a self-supervised learning

  Learning of Unpredictable Socioeconomic Costs","26 pages; 4 figures",,,,"math.OC econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The socioeconomic impact of pollution naturally comes with uncertainty due
to, e.g., current new technological developments in emissions' abatement or
demographic changes. On top of that, the trend of the future costs of the
environmental damage is unknown: Will global warming dominate or technological
advancements prevail? The truth is that we do not know which scenario will be
realised and the scientific debate is still open. This paper captures those two
layers of uncertainty by developing a real-options-like model in which a
decision maker aims at adopting a once-and-for-all costly reduction in the
current emissions rate, when the stochastic dynamics of the socioeconomic costs
of pollution are subject to Brownian shocks and the drift is an unobservable
random variable. By keeping track of the actual evolution of the costs, the
decision maker is able to learn the unknown drift and to form a posterior
dynamic belief of its true value. The resulting decision maker's timing problem
boils down to a truly two-dimensional optimal stopping problem which we address
via probabilistic free-boundary methods and a state-space transformation. We
show that the optimal timing for implementing the emissions reduction policy is
the first time that the learning process has become ``decisive'' enough; that
is, when it exceeds a time-dependent percentage. This is given in terms of an
endogenously determined threshold uniquely solving a nonlinear integral
equation, which we can solve numerically. We discuss the implications of the
optimal policy and also perform comparative statics to understand the role of
the relevant model's parameters in the optimal policy.

One such case is the exceptional chain (EC), which is formed by the

we investigate a non-Hermitian classical mechanical system and reveal that a
symmetry intrinsic to second-order dynamical equations, in combination with the
source-free principle of ELs, guarantees the emergence of ECs. This symmetry
can be understood as a non-Hermitian generalized latent symmetry, which is
absent in prevailing formalisms rooted in first-order Schr\""odinger-like

characterize the ECs using an active mechanical oscillator system. Moreover, by
measuring eigenvalue braiding around the ELs meeting at a chain point, we

critically depends on the capacity of the interconnecting network. This paper
is motivated by the vision of self-adjusting infrastructures whose resources
can be adjusted according to the workload they currently serve, in a
demand-aware manner. Such dynamic adjustments can be exploited to improve
network utilization and hence performance, by dynamically moving frequently
interacting communication partners closer, e.g., collocating them in the same
server or datacenter rack.
  In particular, we revisit the online balanced graph partitioning problem
which captures the fundamental tradeoff between the benefits and costs of
dynamically collocating communication partners. The demand is modelled as a
sequence $\sigma$ (revealed in an online manner) of communication requests
between $n$ processes, each of which is running on one of the $\ell$ servers.
Each server has capacity $k=n/\ell$, hence, the processes have to be scheduled
in a balanced manner across the servers. A request incurs cost $1$, if the
requested processes are located on different servers, otherwise the cost is 0.
A process can be migrated to a different server at cost $1$.
  This paper presents the first online algorithm for online balanced graph
partitioning achieving a polylogarithmic competitive ratio for the fundamental
case of ring communication patterns. Specifically, our main contribution is a
$O(\log^3 n)$-competitive randomized online algorithm for this problem. We
further present a randomized online algorithm which is $O(\log^2
n)$-competitive when compared to a static optimal solution. Our two results
rely on different algorithms and techniques and hence are of independent
interest.

the independent expressions for the drag, lift and torque coefficients of
axi-symmetric particles in a locally uniform flow are also provided in this

generated using available analytical expressions in the viscous regime, and
performing direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the flow past the
axi-symmetric particles at finite particle Reynolds number. The DNS are
performed using the direct-forcing immersed boundary method. The coefficients
in the proposed drag, lift and torque correlations are fitted with a high
degree of accuracy, where the mean error in the prediction lies below $2\%$ for
the locally uniform flow correlations, and $5\%$ for the correlation accounting
for the change in the hydrodynamic forces in case of a linear shear flow. The
proposed correlations for the drag, lift and torque coefficients can be used in
large-scale simulations performed in the Eulerian-Lagrangian framework with

(TCB-splines) for representing and analyzing the Kirchhoff-Love shell in the
context of isogeometric analysis (IGA). The Kirchhoff-Love shell formulation
requires global $C^1$-continuous basis functions. The nonuniform rational
B-spline (NURBS)-based IGA has been extensively used for developing
Kirchhoff-Love shell elements. However, shells with complex geometries
inevitably need multiple patches and trimming techniques, where stitching
patches with high continuity is a challenge. On the other hand, due to their
unstructured nature, TCB-splines can accommodate general polygonal domains,
have local refinement, and are flexible to model complex geometries with $C^1$
continuity, which naturally fit into the Kirchhoff-Love shell formulation with
complex geometries. Therefore, we propose to use TCB-splines as basis functions
for geometric representation and solution approximation. We apply our method to
both linear and nonlinear benchmark shell problems, where the accuracy and
robustness are validated. The applicability of the proposed approach to shell
analysis is further exemplified by performing geometrically nonlinear
Kirchhoff-Love shell simulations of a pipe junction and a front bumper
represented by a single patch of TCB-splines.

processes on metric graphs, which are specified as solutions to a
fractional-order stochastic differential equation on the metric graph. Contrary
to earlier covariance-based approaches for specifying Gaussian fields on metric
graphs, the Whittle-Mat\'ern fields are well-defined for any compact metric
graph and can provide Gaussian processes with differentiable sample paths given
that the fractional exponent is large enough. We derive the main statistical
properties of the model class. In particular, consistency and asymptotic
normality of maximum likelihood estimators of model parameters as well as
necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotic optimality properties of
linear prediction based on the model with misspecified parameters.
  The covariance function of the Whittle-Mat\'ern fields is in general not
available in closed form, which means that they have been difficult to use for
statistical inference. However, we show that for certain values of the
fractional exponent, when the fields have Markov properties, likelihood-based
inference and spatial prediction can be performed exactly and computationally
efficiently. This facilitates using the Whittle-Mat\'ern fields in statistical
applications involving big datasets without the need for any approximations.
The methods are illustrated via an application to modeling of traffic data,
where the ability to allow for differentiable processes greatly improves the

experimental dataset of MRI-derived breast phantoms was used. Results:
NASNetLarge is the best architecture which can be used for the CNN model with

in an $AdS_{d+1}$ background and the holographic entanglement entropies of
$CFT_d$ subsystems in Minkowski spacetime ${\mathbb R}^{d-1,1}$, calculated for
the vacuum state. We show that the area of the world sheet of a string segment
measured in appropriate units on the $AdS$ side can be connected to certain
combinations of entanglement entropies on the $CFT$ side if $d$ is even. For
the special case of $AdS_3$ we prove that this combination is precisely the one
showing up in proofs of strong subadditivity for the covariant holographic
entanglement entropy proposal. More precisely: the segmented stringy area in
units of $4GL$ ($G$ is Newton's constant and $L$ is the $AdS$ length) is just
the conditional mutual information $I(A,C\vert B)$ calculated for a trapezoid
configuration arising from boosted spacelike intervals $A$,$B$ and $C$. The
causal diamonds of such a configuration encode information for a unique
reconstruction of the string world sheet in a holographic manner. We prove that
the four special points of the causal diamonds involved in this reconstruction
(corresponding to the future and past tips of two intersecting diamonds) have a
peculiar property. They are representing a causally ordered set of consecutive
events in boosted inertial frames or in noninertial ones proceeding with
constant acceleration, i.e. exhibiting hyperbolic motion. The acceleration of
such frames is related to the normal vector of the world sheet of the
corresponding string segment. It is also shown that the variation of the
discretized Nambu-Goto action leads to an equation for entanglement entropies
in the boundary theory of the form of a Toda equation.

satellite galaxy quenching (ASGQ), has been found in observational data and
cosmological simulations. Analyzing the IllustrisTNG simulation,
Mart\'in-Navarro et al. (2021) recently argued that ASGQ is caused by
anisotropic energetic feedback and constitutes ""compelling observational
evidence for the role of black holes in regulating galaxy evolution."" In this
letter, we study the causes of ASGQ in state-of-the-art galaxy formation
simulations to evaluate this claim. We show that cosmological simulations
predict that on average, satellite galaxies along the major axis of the dark
matter halo tend to have been accreted at earlier cosmic times and are hosted
by subhalos of larger peak halo masses. As a result, a modulation of the
quenched fraction with respect to the major axis of the central galaxy is a
natural prediction of hierarchical structure formation. We show that ASGQ is
predicted by the UniverseMachine galaxy formation model, a model without
anisotropic feedback. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even in the IllustrisTNG

ASGQ. Ultimately, we argue that ASGQ is not a reliable indicator of

This state has both entangled singlet triplet-pair and charge-transfer
character. Our theory is predicated on the assumption that it is the singlet
triplet-pair component of the 'dark' state that undergoes bimolecular singlet
fission. We use valence bond theory to develop a minimal two-chain model of the

described, as this helps explain the dynamics and the equilibrated populations.
We simulate the dynamics of the initial entangled pair state using the quantum
Liouville equation, including both spin-conserving and spin-nonconserving
dephasing processes. By computing the intrachain and interchain singlet,

contact tracing not only cuts direct infection paths but can also pre-emptively
quarantine group members such that it will cut indirect spreading routes. We
show these results by using a deliberately stylized model that allows us to
isolate the effect of contact tracing within the clique structure of the
network where the contagion is spreading. This will enable us to derive
mean-field approximations and epidemic thresholds to demonstrate the efficiency
of contact tracing in social networks with small groups. This analysis shows
that contact tracing in networks with groups is more efficient the larger the
groups are. We show how these results can be understood by approximating the
combination of disease spreading and contact tracing with a complex contagion
process where every failed infection attempt will lead to a lower infection
probability in the next attempts. Our results illustrate how contract tracing

dimension-independent given the usual conditions on the weights. We present an
algorithm that can construct suitable generating vectors \emph{offline} ahead

(2023)) proved that the Move Acceptance Hyper-Heuristic (MAHH) leaves the local
optimum of the multimodal cliff benchmark with remarkable efficiency. With its
$O(n^3)$ runtime, for almost all cliff widths $d,$ the MAHH massively
outperforms the $\Theta(n^d)$ runtime of simple elitist evolutionary algorithms
(EAs). For the most prominent multimodal benchmark, the jump functions, the
given runtime estimates of $O(n^{2m} m^{-\Theta(m)})$ and
$\Omega(2^{\Omega(m)})$, for gap size $m \ge 2$, are far apart and the real
performance of MAHH is still an open question.
  In this work, we resolve this question. We prove that for any choice of the
MAHH selection parameter~$p$, the expected runtime of the MAHH on a jump
function with gap size $m = o(n^{1/2})$ is at least $\Omega(n^{2m-1} /
(2m-1)!)$. This renders the MAHH much slower than simple elitist evolutionary
algorithms with their typical $O(n^m)$ runtime.
  We also show that the MAHH with the global bit-wise mutation operator instead
of the local one-bit operator optimizes jump functions in time $O(\min\{m
n^m,\frac{n^{2m-1}}{m!\Omega(m)^{m-2}}\})$, essentially the minimum of the
optimization times of the $(1+1)$ EA and the MAHH. This suggests that combining
several ways to cope with local optima can be a fruitful approach.

long-term observations of one of the closest examples of the hydrogen-poor
subclass (SLSNe-I), SN~2017egm, revealing the most complicated known luminosity
evolution of SLSNe-I. Three distinct post-peak bumps were recorded in its light
curve collected at about $100$--350\,days after maximum brightness, challenging
current popular power models such as magnetar, fallback accretion, and
interaction between ejecta and a circumstellar shell. However, the complex
light curve can be well modelled by successive interactions with multiple
circumstellar shells with a total mass of about $6.8$--7.7\,M$_\odot$. In this
scenario, large energy deposition from interaction-induced reverse shocks
results in ionization of neutral oxygen in the supernova ejecta and hence a
much lower nebular-phase line ratio of [O\,\textsc{i}]
$\lambda6300$/([Ca\,\textsc{ii}] + [O\,\textsc{ii}]) $\lambda7300$ ($\sim 0.2$)
compared with that derived for other superluminous and normal stripped-envelope

SN~2017egm experienced pulsational mass ejections triggered by pair instability
within 2 years before explosion, in robust agreement with theoretical
predictions for a pre-pulsation helium-core mass of 48--51\,M$_{\odot}$.
Finally, this work shows that the final explosion product may be a black hole
with about 40\,M$_{\odot}$, and has significant implication for the formation
of such heavy black holes that have been recently observed by LIGO-Virgo

FET with state of the art miniaturized dimensions for high performance charge
qubit operation at room temperature. Relevant gate voltages in such device can
create two voltage tunable quantum dots (VTQDs) underneath the gates, as well
as can manipulate their eigenstate detuning and the inter-dot coupling to
generate superposition, whereas a small drain bias may cause its collapse
leading to qubit read out. Such qubit operations, i.e., Initialization,
Manipulation, and Measurement, are theoretically modeled in the present work by
developing a second quantization filed operator based Schrodinger-Poisson
self-consistent framework coupled to non-equilibrium Greens function formalism.
The study shows that the Bloch sphere coverage can be discretized along polar
and azimuthal directions by reducing the nanowire diameter and increasing the
inter-dot separation respectively, that can be utilized for selective
information encoding. The theoretically obtained stability diagrams suggest
that downscaled nanowire diameter and increased gate separation sharpen the
bonding and anti-bonding states with reduced anticrossing leading to a gradual
transformation of the hyperbolic current mapping into a pair of straight lines.
However, the dephasing time in the proposed GaAs VTQD-based qubit may be
significantly improved by scaling down both the nanowire diameter and gate
separation. Therefore, the present study suggests an optimization window for
geometrical engineering of a dual gate nanowire FET qubit to achieve superior
qubit performance. Most importantly, such device is compatible with the
mainstream CMOS technology and can be utilized for large scale implementation
by little modification of the state of the art fabrication processes.

of work based on unconventional physical systems have been proposed which
addresses the issue of energy efficiency in the inference phase, efficient
training of deep learning models has remained unaddressed. So far, training of
digital deep learning models mainly relies on backpropagation, which is not

quantitative investment to select stocks with higher return ratios for

approaches are still weak in risk control, which may lead to intolerable paper
losses in practical stock investing. To effectively reduce risks, we draw
inspiration from adversarial perturbations and propose a novel Split
Variational Adversarial Training (SVAT) framework for risk-aware stock
recommendation. Essentially, SVAT encourages the model to be sensitive to
adversarial perturbations of risky stock examples and enhances the model's risk
awareness by learning from perturbations. To generate representative
adversarial examples as risk indicators, we devise a variational perturbation
generator to model diverse risk factors. Particularly, the variational
architecture enables our method to provide a rough risk quantification for
investors, showing an additional advantage of interpretability. Experiments on
three real-world stock market datasets show that SVAT effectively reduces the
volatility of the stock recommendation model and outperforms state-of-the-art

conversational intelligent virtual assistants. However, most of the
state-of-the-art intelligent virtual assistants (IVAs) are failed to interpret
the affective semantics of human voices. This research proposes an
anthropomorphic intelligent system that can hold a proper human-like
conversation with emotion and personality. A voice style transfer method is
also proposed to map the attributes of a specific emotion. Initially, the
frequency domain data (Mel-Spectrogram) is created by converting the temporal
audio wave data, which comprises discrete patterns for audio features such as
notes, pitch, rhythm, and melody. A collateral CNN-Transformer-Encoder is used
to predict seven different affective states from voice. The voice is also fed
parallelly to the deep-speech, an RNN model that generates the text
transcription from the spectrogram. Then the transcripted text is transferred
to the multi-domain conversation agent using blended skill talk,
transformer-based retrieve-and-generate generation strategy, and beam-search
decoding, and an appropriate textual response is generated. The system learns
an invertible mapping of data to a latent space that can be manipulated and
generates a Mel-spectrogram frame based on previous Mel-spectrogram frames to
voice synthesize and style transfer. Finally, the waveform is generated using
WaveGlow from the spectrogram. The outcomes of the studies we conducted on
individual models were auspicious. Furthermore, users who interacted with the
system provided positive feedback, demonstrating the system's effectiveness.

  Hallucinations",,,,,"cs.SD cs.HC cs.LG eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Hallucination is an apparent perception in the absence of real external
sensory stimuli. An auditory hallucination is a perception of hearing sounds
that are not real. A common form of auditory hallucination is hearing voices in
the absence of any speakers which is known as Auditory Verbal Hallucination
(AVH). AVH is fragments of the mind's creation that mostly occur in people
diagnosed with mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.
Assessing the valence of hallucinated voices (i.e., how negative or positive
voices are) can help measure the severity of a mental illness. We study N=435
individuals, who experience hearing voices, to assess auditory verbal
hallucination. Participants report the valence of voices they hear four times a
day for a month through ecological momentary assessments with questions that
have four answering scales from ``not at all'' to ``extremely''. We collect
these self-reports as the valence supervision of AVH events via a mobile
application. Using the application, participants also record audio diaries to
describe the content of hallucinated voices verbally. In addition, we passively
collect mobile sensing data as contextual signals. We then experiment with how
predictive these linguistic and contextual cues from the audio diary and mobile
sensing data are of an auditory verbal hallucination event. Finally, using
transfer learning and data fusion techniques, we train a neural net model that
predicts the valance of AVH with a performance of 54\% top-1 and 72\% top-2 F1
score.

well in dynamic scenarios, e.g., when some people move around the subject to be
tracked, or a subject waves his/her arms and marches on the spot. Three major

Firstly, we utilize a camera to assist a mmWave radar to accurately localize
the subjects of interest. Secondly, we exploit the calculated subject position
to form transmitting and receiving beamformers, which can improve the reflected

learning, aims at grouping semantically similar text segments without relying

clustering has achieved significant advantages over traditional clustering
methods. Despite the effectiveness, most existing deep text clustering methods
rely heavily on representations pre-trained in general domains, which may not
be the most suitable solution for clustering in specific target domains. To
address this issue, we propose CEIL, a novel Classification-Enhanced Iterative
Learning framework for short text clustering, which aims at generally promoting
the clustering performance by introducing a classification objective to
iteratively improve feature representations. In each iteration, we first adopt
a language model to retrieve the initial text representations, from which the
clustering results are collected using our proposed Category Disentangled
Contrastive Clustering (CDCC) algorithm. After strict data filtering and
aggregation processes, samples with clean category labels are retrieved, which
serve as supervision information to update the language model with the
classification objective via a prompt learning approach. Finally, the updated
language model with improved representation ability is used to enhance
clustering in the next iteration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CEIL framework significantly improves the clustering performance over
iterations, and is generally effective on various clustering algorithms.
Moreover, by incorporating CEIL on CDCC, we achieve the state-of-the-art
clustering performance on a wide range of short text clustering benchmarks
outperforming other strong baseline methods.

is aligning their behavior to be useful and unharmful for their human users.
This is usually achieved by tuning the model in a way that enhances desired
behaviors and inhibits undesired ones, a process referred to as alignment. In
this paper, we propose a theoretical approach called Behavior Expectation
Bounds (BEB) which allows us to formally investigate several inherent
characteristics and limitations of alignment in large language models.
Importantly, we prove that for any behavior that has a finite probability of
being exhibited by the model, there exist prompts that can trigger the model
into outputting this behavior, with probability that increases with the length
of the prompt. This implies that any alignment process that attenuates
undesired behavior but does not remove it altogether, is not safe against
adversarial prompting attacks. Furthermore, our framework hints at the
mechanism by which leading alignment approaches such as reinforcement learning
from human feedback increase the LLM's proneness to being prompted into the
undesired behaviors. Moreover, we include the notion of personas in our BEB
framework, and find that behaviors which are generally very unlikely to be
exhibited by the model can be brought to the front by prompting the model to
behave as specific persona. This theoretical result is being experimentally
demonstrated in large scale by the so called contemporary ""chatGPT jailbreaks"",
where adversarial users trick the LLM into breaking its alignment guardrails by
triggering it into acting as a malicious persona. Our results expose
fundamental limitations in alignment of LLMs and bring to the forefront the
need to devise reliable mechanisms for ensuring AI safety.

Procrustes problem to serve a means to cross-modal information retrieval. That

Gibbs paradox. The essence of the error lies in the fact that the entropy of an
ideal gas is attributed to additive quantities, but it is not correct. The
value of an additive quantity for a whole object is equal to the sum of its
values for the parts of the object in any division of the object into parts.
The entropy of an ideal gas in classical thermodynamics is expressed by the
equation that contains the term Rnln(V/n), where n is the number of moles of
gas, V is the volume of gas, R is the universal gas constant, or by equations
equivalent to it. As a result, the entropy of an ideal gas is equal to the sum
of the entropies of its parts only if the parts of the gas are in different
places (separated by an impermeable partition). If the parts of the gas form a
mixture, then the sum of the entropies of the parts is not equal to the entropy
of the gas. Despite this, the entropy of an ideal gas is considered to be an
additive quantity. This gives rise to a series of inexplicable conclusions
known as different formulations of the Gibbs paradox.

demonstrates a matter wave-based manipulation scenario that gives rise to
reversible lateral force on an atom due to the interaction energy of the
quantum mechanical matter wave in the presence of a metal surface creating an
asymmetrical set-up. For a symmetric set-up, no lateral force has been
observed. We have performed several full wave simulations and analytical
calculations on a particular set-up of Xenon scatterer atoms placed near a
Copper surface, with two plane matter waves of Helium impinging in the
direction parallel to the surface from two sides of the scatterer. By solving
the time-independent Schrodinger equation and using the solution, quantum
mechanical stress tensor formalism has been applied to compute the force acting
on the particle. The full wave simulation results have been found in excellent
agreement with the analytical calculations. The results for the adsorbed
scatterer case suggests that our proposed technique can be an efficient
cleaning procedure similar to electron-stimulated desorption for futuristic
applications.

specialized hardware architectures have been proposed. Each DNN layer should be
mapped onto the hardware with the most efficient schedule, however, SotA
schedulers struggle to consistently provide optimum schedules in a reasonable
time across all DNN-HW combinations.
  This paper proposes SALSA, a fast dual-engine scheduler to generate optimal
execution schedules for both even and uneven mapping. We introduce a new
strategy, combining exhaustive search with simulated annealing to address the
dynamic nature of the loop ordering design space size across layers. SALSA is
extensively benchmarked against two SotA schedulers, LOMA and Timeloop on 5
different DNNs, on average SALSA finds schedules with 11.9% and 7.6% lower
energy while speeding up the search by 1.7x and 24x compared to LOMA and
Timeloop, respectively.

  Permanent Faults in DNN Hardware Accelerators","8 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.AR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fault-Aware Training (FAT) has emerged as a highly effective technique for
addressing permanent faults in DNN accelerators, as it offers fault mitigation
without significant performance or accuracy loss, specifically at low and
moderate fault rates. However, it leads to very high retraining overheads,
especially when used for large DNNs designed for complex AI applications.
Moreover, as each fabricated chip can have a distinct fault pattern, FAT is
required to be performed for each faulty chip individually, considering its
unique fault map, which further aggravates the problem. To reduce the overheads
of FAT while maintaining its benefits, we propose (1) the concepts of
resilience-driven retraining amount selection, and (2) resilience-driven
grouping and fusion of multiple fault maps (belonging to different chips) to
perform consolidated retraining for a group of faulty chips. To realize these
concepts, in this work, we present a novel framework, eFAT, that computes the
resilience of a given DNN to faults at different fault rates and with different
levels of retraining, and it uses that knowledge to build a resilience map
given a user-defined accuracy constraint. Then, it uses the resilience map to
compute the amount of retraining required for each chip, considering its unique
fault map. Afterward, it performs resilience and reward-driven grouping and
fusion of fault maps to further reduce the number of retraining iterations
required for tuning the given DNN for the given set of faulty chips. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for a systolic array-based DNN
accelerator experiencing permanent faults in the computational array. Our
extensive results for numerous chips show that the proposed technique
significantly reduces the retraining cost when used for tuning a DNN for
multiple faulty chips.

an answer without quantitative computing. QA studies qualitative properties of
the functions. The core of any QA is a set of unitary quantum operators or
quantum gates. In practical representation, quantum gate is a unitary matrix
with particular structure. The size of this matrix grows exponentially with an
increase in the number of inputs, which significantly limits the QA simulation

(QSA) - models apply for the solution of computer science problems as searching
in unstructured data base, quantum cryptography, engineering tasks, control

(IoT) paradigm marked by low-power and long-distance communication. Among them,
LoRa is widely deployed for its unique characteristics and open-source
technology. By adopting the Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation, LoRa
enables low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) communication. The standard LoRa
demodulation method accumulates the chirp power of the whole chirp into an
energy peak in the frequency domain. In this way, it can support communication
even when SNR is lower than -15 dB. Beyond that, we proposed NELoRa, a
neural-enhanced decoder that exploits multi-dimensional information to achieve
significant SNR gain. This paper presents the dataset used to train/test
NELoRa, which includes 27,329 LoRa symbols with spreading factors from 7 to 10,
for further improvement of neural-enhanced LoRa demodulation. The dataset shows
that NELoRa can achieve 1.84-2.35 dB SNR gain over the standard LoRa decoder.

for adaptive traffic signal control to optimize the travel time of vehicles

cooperation among junctions (agents) remains an open challenge, as existing
methods often rely on extensive, non-generalizable reward shaping or on
non-scalable centralized learning. To address these problems, we propose a new
MARL method for traffic signal control, SocialLight, which learns cooperative
traffic control policies by distributedly estimating the individual marginal
contribution of agents on their local neighborhood. SocialLight relies on the
Asynchronous Actor Critic (A3C) framework, and makes learning scalable by
learning a locally-centralized critic conditioned over the states and actions
of neighboring agents, used by agents to estimate individual contributions by
counterfactual reasoning. We further introduce important modifications to the
advantage calculation that help stabilize policy updates. These modifications
decouple the impact of the neighbors' actions on the computed advantages,
thereby reducing the variance in the gradient updates. We benchmark our trained
network against state-of-the-art traffic signal control methods on standard
benchmarks in two traffic simulators, SUMO and CityFlow. Our results show that
SocialLight exhibits improved scalability to larger road networks and better
performance across usual traffic metrics.

substructures in a typical star-forming galaxy (SFG), UDF2, at $z = 2.696$. To
date, substructures containing significant buildup of stellar mass and actively
forming stars have yet to be found in typical (i.e., main-sequence) SFGs at $z
> 2$. This is due to the strong dust attenuation common in massive galaxies at
the epoch and the scarcity of high-resolution, high-sensitivity
extinction-independent imaging. To search for disk substructures, we subtracted
the central stellar-mass disk from the JWST/NIRCam rest-frame 1.2 $\mu$m image
($0.13''$ resolution) and subtracted, in the visibility plane, the central
starburst disk from ALMA rest-frame 240 $\mu$m observations ($0.03''$
resolution). The residual images revealed substructures at rest-frame 1.2
$\mu$m co-located with those found at rest-frame 240 $\mu$m, $\simeq 2$ kpc
away from the galactic center. The largest substructure contains $\simeq20$% of
the total stellar mass and $\simeq5$% of the total SFR of the galaxy. While
UDF2 exhibits a kinematically-ordered velocity field of molecular gas
consistent with a secularly evolving disk, more sensitive observations are
required to characterize the nature and the origin of this substructure (spiral
arms, minor merger, or other types of disk instabilities). UDF2 resides in an
overdense region ($N \geqslant 4$ massive galaxies within 70 kpc projected
distance at $z=2.690-2.697$) and the substructures may be associated with
interaction-induced instabilities. Importantly, a statistical sample of such
substructures identified with JWST and ALMA could play a key role in bridging
the gap between the bulge-forming starburst and the rest of the galaxy.

principle's role in collective motion is analyzed leading to a reimagination of
the microscopic dynamics underlying superfluidity/superconductivity and a
reinterpretation of several interrelated phenomena: Cooper pairs, the Fermi
sea, and Pauli blocking. The current approach, symmetry-invariant perturbation
theory is a first principles method with no adjustable parameters. An adiabatic
evolution is employed to transfer the well-known Pauli restrictions for
identical, independent particles with two spin values to restrictions on the
collective modes of an ensemble of ``spin up'' ``spin down'' particles. The
collective modes, analytic N-body normal modes, are obtained from a group
theoretic exact solution of the first-order equations. Cooper pairing is
reinterpreted not as the pairing of two fermions with total zero momentum, but
as the convergence of the momentum of the entire ensemble to two values, +k and
-k, as the particles in the normal mode move back and forth with a single
frequency and phase. The Fermi sea and Pauli blocking, commonly described using
independent fermions that occupy lower states to create a ``sea'' in energy
space and block occupation is redescribed as a collective energy phenomena of
the entire ensemble. Superfluidity, which has always been viewed as a
collective phenomena as Cooper pairs are assumed to condense into a macroscopic
occupation of a single lowest state, is now reimagined without two-body pairing
in real space, but as a macroscopic occupation of a low-energy phonon normal
mode resulting in the convergence of the momentum to two equal and opposite
values. The expected properties of superfluidity including the rigidity of the
wave function, interactions between fermions in different pairs, convergence of
the momentum and the gap in the excitation spectrum are discussed.

modeling traffic network congestion generated by self-interested travelers who
sequentially select arcs based on their perceived latency on the network.
However, existing arc-based TAMs either assign travelers to cyclic paths, or do
not extend to networks with bi-directional arcs (or edges) between nodes. To
overcome these difficulties, we propose a new modeling framework for stochastic
arc-based TAMs. Given a traffic network with bidirectional arcs, we replicate
its arcs and nodes to construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which we call
the Condensed DAG (CoDAG) representation. Self-interested travelers
sequentially select arcs on the CoDAG representation to reach their
destination. We show that the associated equilibrium flow, which we call the
Condensed DAG equilibrium, exists, is unique, and can be characterized as a
strictly convex optimization problem. Moreover, we propose a discrete-time
dynamical system that captures a natural adaptation rule employed by
self-interested travelers to learn about the emergent congestion on the
network. We show that the arc flows generated by this adaptation rule converges
to a neighborhood of Condensed DAG equilibrium. To our knowledge, our work is
the first to study learning and adaptation in an arc-based TAM. Finally, we
present numerical results that corroborate our theoretical results.

increasing attention as tools to support drug discovery. The lead optimization
mapper (Lomap) was proposed as an algorithm to calculate the relative free

each edge in the FEP graph is removable, which necessitates checking the
constraints for all edges. Consequently, conventional Lomap requires
significant computation time, at least several hours for cases involving
hundreds of compounds, and is impractical for cases with more than tens of
thousands of edges. In this study, we aimed to reduce the computational cost of
Lomap to enable the construction of FEP graphs for hundreds of compounds. We
can reduce the overall number of constraint checks required from an amount
dependent on the number of edges to one dependent on the number of nodes by
using the chunk check process to check the constraints for as many edges as
possible simultaneously. Moreover, the output graph is equivalent to that
obtained using conventional Lomap, enabling direct replacement of the original

of the surface heat flux relative to the strength of the background stable
stratification. At very low $\Pi_s$ values, the pure conduction state remains
stable. Beyond a threshold $\Pi_s$ value, it bifurcates into asymmetric and

instability manifests as a perfect mirror image of a clockwise and
counterclockwise circulation in the valley. The symmetric instability gives
rise to an upslope and a downslope convection patterns which are not mirror

these two symmetric states are linearly unstable and will transition to the

entities, i.e., the transductive setting. In the inductive setting where test
TKGs contain emerging entities, the latest methods are based on symbolic rules

inflexible and not time-specific, respectively. In this work, we extend the
fully-inductive setting, where entities in the training and test sets are
totally disjoint, into TKGs and take a further step towards a more flexible and
time-sensitive temporal relation prediction approach SST-BERT, incorporating
Structured Sentences with Time-enhanced BERT. Our model can obtain the entity
history and implicitly learn rules in the semantic space by encoding structured

problem by leveraging translation API, pre-trained word embeddings, and other
off-the-shelf tools. However, these approaches over-rely on the side

absent. On the contrary, they still insufficiently exploit the most fundamental
graph structure information in KG. To improve the exploitation of the

Weakly-Optimal Graph Contrastive Learning (WOGCL), which is refined on three

the mutual interactions. Focussing on the collisionless regime, where we
neglect the collision integral, we chalk out the possible excitations spanning
the entire spectrum of angular momentum ($\ell$) channels (i.e., including both
small and large values of $\ell$). The excitations are of two types:
particle-hole like localized excitations forming an energy band (or continuum)
and delocalized collective modes with discrete energies. Although we find a
collective mode analogous to the zero sound of a Fermi liquid, its dispersion
shows a crossover from a $\Omega \sim |\mathbf q|^{6/5}$ behaviour to the usual
$ \Omega \sim |\mathbf q|$ dependence, where $\Omega$ and $\mathbf q$ represent
the frequency and momentum, respectively. We estimate the frequency scale at
which this crossover takes place. We also determine the boundary for the
particle-hole continuum in the $\Omega$-$\mathbf q$ plane, and observe a
crossover from $\Omega \sim |\mathbf q|^{3/2}$ to $ \Omega \sim |\mathbf q|$
behaviour, determined by another crossover frequency scale.

total variation distance from a warm start by $\tilde
O(d^{1/4}\text{polylog}(1/\epsilon))$ and demonstrate the benefit of choosing
the number of leapfrog steps to be larger than 1. To surpass previous analysis
on Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) that has
$\tilde{O}(d^{1/2}\text{polylog}(1/\epsilon))$ dimension dependency in Wu et
al. (2022), we reveal a key feature in our proof that the joint distribution of
the location and velocity variables of the discretization of the continuous HMC
dynamics stays approximately invariant. This key feature, when shown via
induction over the number of leapfrog steps, enables us to obtain estimates on
moments of various quantities that appear in the acceptance rate control of
Metropolized HMC. Moreover, to deal with another bottleneck on the HMC proposal
distribution overlap control in the literature, we provide a new approach to
upper bound the Kullback-Leibler divergence between push-forwards of the
Gaussian distribution through HMC dynamics initialized at two different points.
Notably, our analysis does not require log-concavity or independence of the
marginals, and only relies on an isoperimetric inequality. To illustrate the
applicability of our result, several examples of natural functions that fall

formulate a bi-objective design-for-control problem where locations and
operational settings of pressure control and automatic flushing valves are

solve the sequence of parametrized single-objective problems. The resulting
Pareto fronts suggest that significant improvements in SCC can be achieved for
minimal trade-offs in AZP performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that a
hierarchical design strategy is capable of yielding good quality solutions to
both objectives. This hierarchical design considers pressure control valves
first placed for the primary AZP objective, followed by automatic flushing
valves placed to augment SCC conditions. In addition, we investigate an
adaptive control scheme for dynamically transitioning between AZP and SCC
controls. We demonstrate these control challenges on case networks with both

  Factor Variations in Nearby Barred Galaxy Centers","Accepted for publication in ApJ; 30 pages of main text + 3 appendices",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_\rm{CO}$) is central to measuring
the amount and properties of molecular gas. It is known to vary with
environmental conditions, and previous studies have revealed lower
$\alpha_\rm{CO}$ in the centers of some barred galaxies on kpc scales. To
unveil the physical drivers of such variations, we obtained ALMA Band 3, 6, and
7 observations toward the inner 2 kpc of NGC 3627 and NGC 4321 tracing
$^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O lines on 100 pc scales. Our multi-line
modeling and Bayesian likelihood analysis of these datasets reveal variations
of molecular gas density, temperature, optical depth, and velocity dispersion,
which are among the key drivers of $\alpha_\rm{CO}$. The central 300 pc nuclei
in both galaxies show strong enhancement of temperature $T_\rm{k}>100$ K and
density $n_\rm{H_2}>10^3$ cm$^{-3}$. Assuming a CO-to-H$_2$ abundance of
$3\times10^{-4}$, we derive 4-15 times lower $\alpha_\rm{CO}$ than the Galactic
value across our maps, which agrees well with previous kpc-scale measurements.
Combining the results with our previous work on NGC 3351, we find a strong
correlation of $\alpha_\rm{CO}$ with low-J $^{12}$CO optical depths
($\tau_\rm{CO}$), as well as an anti-correlation with $T_\rm{k}$. The
$\tau_\rm{CO}$ correlation explains most of the $\alpha_\rm{CO}$ variation in
the three galaxy centers, whereas changes in $T_\rm{k}$ influence
$\alpha_\rm{CO}$ to second order. Overall, the observed line width and
$^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO 2-1 line ratio correlate with $\tau_\rm{CO}$ variation in
these centers, and thus they are useful observational indicators for
$\alpha_\rm{CO}$ variation. We also test current simulation-based
$\alpha_\rm{CO}$ prescriptions and find a systematic overprediction, which
likely originates from the mismatch of gas conditions between our data and the
simulations.

deepfake videos is typically measured in laboratory settings, which do not
reflect the challenges of real-world browsing. In typical browsing, deepfakes
are rare, engagement with the video may be short, participants may be
distracted, or the video streaming quality may be degraded. Here, we tested
deepfake detection under these ecological viewing conditions, and found that
detection was lowered in all cases. Principles from signal detection theory
indicated that different viewing conditions affected different dimensions of
detection performance. Overall, this suggests that the current literature
underestimates people's susceptibility to deepfakes. Next, we examined how
computer vision models might be integrated into users' decision process to
increase accuracy and confidence during deepfake detection. We evaluated the
effectiveness of communicating the model's prediction to the user by amplifying
artifacts in fake videos. We found that artifact amplification was highly
effective at making fake video distinguishable from real, in a manner that was
robust across viewing conditions. Additionally, compared to a traditional
text-based prompt, artifact amplification was more convincing: people accepted
the model's suggestion more often, and reported higher final confidence in
their model-supported decision, particularly for more challenging videos.
Overall, this suggests that visual indicators that cause distortions on fake
videos may be highly effective at mitigating the impact of falsified video.

however, the CML does not learn when and why to move from one node state to
another. This work created CMLs with node states expressed as high dimensional
vectors suitable for hyperdimensional computing (HDC), a form of symbolic
machine learning (ML). In so doing, graph knowledge (CML) was segregated from
target node selection (HDC), allowing each ML approach to be trained
independently. The first approach used HDC to engineer an arbitrary number of
hierarchical CMLs, where each graph node state specified target node states for
the next lower level CMLs to traverse to. Second, an HDC-based
stimulus-response experience model was demonstrated per CML. Because
hypervectors may be in superposition with each other, multiple experience
models were added together and run in parallel without any retraining. Lastly,
a CML-HDC ML unit was modularized: trained with proxy symbols such that
arbitrary, application-specific stimulus symbols could be operated upon without
retraining either CML or HDC model. These methods provide a template for

always be possible to detect AI-generated text unless the distributions of
human and machine-generated texts are exactly the same over the entire support.
This observation follows from the standard results in information theory and
relies on the fact that if the machine text becomes more human-like, we need
more samples to detect it. We derive a precise sample complexity bound of
AI-generated text detection, which tells how many samples are needed to detect
AI-generated text. This gives rise to additional challenges of designing more
complicated detectors that take in $n$ samples for detection (rather than just

evaluations on various real and synthetic datasets support our claim about the
existence of better detectors, demonstrating that AI-generated text detection

relative importance of stellar versus AGN feedback in these galaxies, we
perform a detailed Keck/KCWI optical integral field spectroscopic study of a
sample of low-redshift star-forming (SF) dwarf galaxies that show outflows in
ionized gas in their SDSS spectra. We characterize the outflows and compare
them to observations of AGN-driven outflows in dwarfs. We find that SF dwarfs
have outflow components that have comparable widths (W$_{80}$) to those of
outflows in AGN dwarfs, but are much less blue-shifted, indicating that SF
dwarfs have significantly slower outflows than their AGN counterparts. The
outflows in SF dwarfs are spatially resolved and significantly more extended

equation that maps data to noise. However, for complex tasks, numerical error
can compound and result in highly unnatural samples. Previous work mitigates
this drift with thresholding, which projects to the natural data domain (such
as pixel space for images) after each diffusion step, but this leads to a
mismatch between the training and generative processes. To incorporate data
constraints in a principled manner, we present Reflected Diffusion Models,
which instead reverse a reflected stochastic differential equation evolving on
the support of the data. Our approach learns the perturbed score function
through a generalized score matching loss and extends key components of
standard diffusion models including diffusion guidance, likelihood-based
training, and ODE sampling. We also bridge the theoretical gap with
thresholding: such schemes are just discretizations of reflected SDEs. On
standard image benchmarks, our method is competitive with or surpasses the
state of the art and, for classifier-free guidance, our approach enables fast
exact sampling with ODEs and produces more faithful samples under high guidance
weight.

While it has been widely studied in NLP, it is still a relatively new area of
research in computer vision. To reveal the factors influencing the performance
of visual in-context learning, this paper shows that prompt selection and
prompt fusion are two major factors that have a direct impact on the inference
performance of visual context learning. Prompt selection is the process of
identifying the most appropriate prompt or example to help the model understand
new tasks. This is important because providing the model with relevant prompts
can help it learn more effectively and efficiently. Prompt fusion involves
combining knowledge from different positions within the large-scale visual
model. By doing this, the model can leverage the diverse knowledge stored in
different parts of the model to improve its performance on new tasks. Based
these findings, we propose a simple framework prompt-SelF for visual in-context

a suitable prompt, and then use different prompt fusion methods to activate all
the knowledge stored in the large-scale model, and finally ensemble the
prediction results obtained from different prompt fusion methods to obtain the
final prediction results. And we conduct extensive experiments on single-object
segmentation and detection tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of
prompt-SelF. Remarkably, the prompt-SelF has outperformed OSLSM based

this is to reconstruct the node features (or structures)--that are randomly

performance of masked feature reconstruction naturally relies on the
discriminability of the input features and is usually vulnerable to disturbance

impose regularization on feature reconstruction for graph SSL. Specifically, we
design the strategies of multi-view random re-mask decoding and latent
representation prediction to regularize the feature reconstruction. The
multi-view random re-mask decoding is to introduce randomness into
reconstruction in the feature space, while the latent representation prediction
is to enforce the reconstruction in the embedding space. Extensive experiments

computationally demanding problems in computational science today. Fine meshes
that are required to accurately compute the PDE solution introduce an enormous
number of parameters and require large scale computing resources such as more
processors and more memory to solve such systems in a reasonable time. For
inverse problems constrained by time dependent PDEs, the adjoint method that is
often employed to efficiently compute gradients and higher order derivatives
requires solving a time-reversed, so-called adjoint PDE that depends on the
forward PDE solution at each timestep. This necessitates the storage of a high
dimensional forward solution vector at every timestep. Such a procedure quickly
exhausts the available memory resources. Several approaches that trade
additional computation for reduced memory footprint have been proposed to
mitigate the memory bottleneck, including checkpointing and compression
strategies. In this work, we propose a close-to-ideal scalable compression
approach using autoencoders to eliminate the need for checkpointing and
substantial memory storage, thereby reducing both the time-to-solution and

stripping might reduce the angular momentum of their gas, causing it to infall
towards the super massive black hole (SMBH) at their centre, activating the AGN
phase. In this work we explore the connection between environment and nuclear
activity by evaluating the variation in the incidence of ionized outflows in
AGN across different environments. We select a sample of $\sim3300$ optical AGN
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 13 that we match with the group
catalogue from Lim et al. 2017. We further probe their environment through the
projected distance to the central galaxy of the group/cluster and the projected
surface density to the 5th neighbour ($\delta_5$). We find that at lower masses
($<10^{10.3}$M$_{\odot}$), the fraction of ionized outflows is significantly
lower in satellite ($\sim7$%) than in isolated ($\sim22$%) AGN. The fraction of
outflows in all satellite AGN decreases towards closer distances to the
central, whereas only the lower-mass ones display a significant decline with
$\delta_5$. Although this study does not include AGN in the densest regions of
galaxy clusters, our findings suggest that AGN in dense environments accrete
less gas than those in the field potentially due to the removal of the gas
reservoirs via stripping or starvation, consistent with a negative connection
between environment and AGN activity. We propose that the observed change in
the incidence of outflows towards denser regions of groups and clusters could
contribute to the higher gas metallicities of cluster galaxies compared to
field ones, especially at lower masses.

algebraic description of their dynamics and their 1-loop RG-flow. We use these
results to formulate a simple algebraic condition on the defining data of such
a model which ensures its 1-loop conformal invariance and the decoupling of its
observables into two chiral Poisson algebras, describing the classical left-
and right-moving fields of the theory. In the case of so-called non-degenerate
$\mathcal{E}$-models, these chiral sectors form two current algebras and the
model takes the form of a WZW theory once realised as a $\sigma$-model. The
case of degenerate $\mathcal{E}$-models, in which a subalgebra of the current
algebra is gauged, is more involved: the conformal condition yields a wider
class of theories, which includes gauged WZW models but also other examples,
seemingly different, which however sometimes turn out to be related to gauged
WZW models based on other Lie algebras. For this class, we build non-local
chiral fields of parafermionic-type as well as higher-spin local ones, forming
classical $\mathcal{W}$-algebras. In particular, we find an explicit and
efficient algorithm to build these local chiral fields. These results (and
their potential generalisations discussed at the end of the paper) open the way

which is universal to any early matter-dominated era and is not only specific

milli-hertz, and the corresponding GW wavelength could be comparable to the
lens gravitational length scale, which requires us to account for wave
diffraction effects. In calculating lensed waveforms, we adopt the
approximation of geometric optics at high frequencies to accelerate
computation, while precisely evaluate the diffraction integral at low
frequencies. Through a Fisher analysis, we analyse the accuracy to estimate the
lens parameters. We find that the accuracy can reach to the level of 10^-3 for
the mass of point mass and SIS lens, and to the level of 10^-5 for the density

effective strategy to control the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. It is
crucial for policymakers to have a comprehensive understanding of the public's
stance towards vaccination on a large scale. However, attitudes towards
COVID-19 vaccination, such as pro-vaccine or vaccine hesitancy, have evolved
over time on social media. Thus, it is necessary to account for possible
temporal shifts when analysing these stances. This study aims to examine the
impact of temporal concept drift on stance detection towards COVID-19
vaccination on Twitter. To this end, we evaluate a range of transformer-based
models using chronological (split the training, validation and testing sets in
the order of time) and random splits (randomly split these three sets) of
social media data. Our findings demonstrate significant discrepancies in model
performance when comparing random and chronological splits across all
monolingual and multilingual datasets. Chronological splits significantly
reduce the accuracy of stance classification. Therefore, real-world stance
detection approaches need to be further refined to incorporate temporal factors

that electrons at energy $E = 0$ avoid localization and simultaneously exhibit
a diverging density of states (DOS). For $N$ coupled chains with
zero-correlation-length disorder, the diverging DOS remains for odd $N$, but a
vanishing DOS is found for even $N$. We use a thin spinless graphene nanotube
with disordered Semenoff mass and disordered Haldane coupling to construct $N =
2$ chiral chain models which at low energy have two linear band crossings at
different momenta $\pm K$ (two valleys) and disorder with an arbitrary
correlation length $\xi$ in units of lattice constant $a$. We find that the
finite momentum $\pm K$ forces the disorder in one valley to depend on the
disorder in the other valley, thus departing from known analytical results
which assume having $N$ independent disorders (whatever their spatial
correlation lengths). Our main numerical results show that for this
inter-dependent mass disorder the DOS is also suppressed in the limit of
strongly coupled valleys (lattice-white noise limit, $\xi/a = 0$) and exhibits
a non-trivial crossover as the valleys decouple ($\xi/a\gtrsim 5$) into the DOS
shapes of the $N = 1$ continuum model with finite correlation length $\xi$. We
also show that changing the intra-unit-cell geometry of the disordered Haldane
coupling can tune the amount of inter-valley scattering yet at lowest energies
it produces the decoupled-valley behavior ($N = 1$) all the way down to lattice
white noise.

systems, also known as metamaterials, with superior performance compared to
conventional monolithic solids. Despite the continuously growing complexity of
synthesized microstructures, mainly enabled by developments in additive
manufacturing, correlating their morphological characteristics to the resulting
material properties has not advanced equally. This work aims to develop a
systematic data-driven framework that is capable of identifying all key
microstructural characteristics and evaluating their effect on a target
material property. The framework relies on integrating virtual structure
generation and quantification algorithms with interpretable surrogate models.
The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated by analyzing the
effective stiffness of a broad class of two-dimensional (2D) cellular
metamaterials with varying topological disorder. The results reveal the complex
manner in which well-known stiffness contributors, including nodal
connectivity, cooperate with often-overlooked microstructural features such as
strut orientation, to determine macroscopic material behavior. We further
re-examine Maxwell's criteria regarding the rigidity of frame structures, as
they pertain to the effective stiffness of cellular solids and showcase
microstructures that violate them. This framework can be used for
structure-property correlation in different classes of metamaterials as well as
the discovery of novel architectures with tailored combinations of material

of the electronic density of states that accounts for non-parabolicity and is
fit to electronic structure calculations. Carrier concentrations obtained from
Hall measurements require a knowledge of the Hall factor, which is arbitrarily
set equal to unit in most practical applications. We have calculated the Hall
factor for n-Ge using a model that accounts for scattering with phonons and
with ionized impurities. We show that determinations of the carrier
concentration n using our computed effective mass and Hall factor virtually
eliminates any systematic discrepancy between the two types of measurement. We
then use these results to compute majority carrier mobilities from measured

users need to interactively test various settings until satisfying clusterings
are found. However, existing solutions suffer from the following limitations:
(a) Ineffective pruning of expensive neighborhood computations. (b) Approximate
clustering, where objects are falsely labeled noise. (c) Restricted parameter
tuning that is limited to {\epsilon} whereas MinPts is constant, which reduces
the explorable clusterings. (d) Inflexibility in terms of applicable data types

flat band regions near the Dirac points along with a non-trivial band geometry.
We analyze the effect of inversion symmetry on the critical temperature and
superfluid stiffness of the superconducting state of AB-stacked graphene
bilayer and on the exciton condensate in double layers formed by two AB-stacked
graphene bilayers. The geometric superfluid stiffness in bilayer graphene
superconductors is found to be negligible due to the small superconducting gap.
Furthermore, we show that the geometric superfluid stiffness is maximized for a
constant order parameter. Therefore, it can be neglected in biased bilayer
graphene superconductors with any pairing symmetry. However, the displacement
field enhances the geometric superfluid stiffness in exciton condensates. It is
most prominent at low densities and high displacement fields. A consequence of
the geometric superfluid stiffness is a modest enhancement of the
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature in bilayer graphene's
exciton condensate.

iii) performing the convex hull for the vertices of the uncertainty space.
Approach i) and ii) introduce a lot of conservatism because both disregard the

develop an exact (meaning no added conservatism) and optimal (smallest growth

Convex Constrained Generators (CCGs). This results in a more efficient method
to represent the minimum volume convex set corresponding to the state
estimation. Given that reductions methods are still lacking in the literature
for CCGs, we employ an approximation using ray-shooting that is comparable in
terms of accuracy with methods for Constrained Zonotopes as the ones
implemented in CORA. Simulations illustrate the greater accuracy of CCGs with
the proposed convex hull operation in comparison to Constrained Zonotopes.

solving the radiative transfer equation for reflected light, in particular

the model accuracy, we have considered higher-order approximations of the phase

using spherical harmonics. The spherical harmonics approximation decouples
spatial and directional dependencies by expanding the intensity and phase
function into a series of spherical harmonics, or Legendre polynomials,
allowing for analytical solutions for low-order approximations to optimize
computational efficiency. We rigorously derive the spherical harmonics method
for reflected light and benchmark the 4-term method (SH4) against Toon89 and
two independent and higher-fidelity methods (CDISORT & doubling-method). On
average, the SH4 method provides an order of magnitude increase in accuracy,

this spherical harmonics derivation to study thermal emission spectroscopy. We
highlight the model differences in the approach for thermal emission and
benchmark the 4-term method (SH4) against Toon89 and a high-stream
discrete-ordinates method, CDISORT. By comparing the spectra produced by each
model we demonstrate that the SH4 method provides a significant increase in
accuracy, compared to Toon89, which can be attributed to the increased order of
approximation and to the choice of phase function. We also explore the
trade-off between computational time and model accuracy. We find that our
4-term method is twice as slow as our 2-term method, but is up to five times
more accurate, when compared with CDISORT. Therefore, SH4 provides excellent
improvement in model accuracy with minimal sacrifice in numerical expense.

topological zero modes are akin to electric charges. To detect them, we
identify elementary mechanical molecules and measure their chiral polarization,
a recently introduced marker of topology in chiral phases. Topological zero
modes are then identified as singularities of the polarization field. Our

near-field signatures of strong coupling are difficult to map as most cavities

under vibrational strong coupling enables the observation of spatial polariton
localization in the grating near-field, without the need for scanning probe
microscopies. The lower polariton is localized at the grating slots, displays a
strongly asymmetric lineshape, and gives greater plasmon-vibration coupling
strength than measured in the far-field. Within these slots, the local field
strength pushes the system into the ultrastrong coupling regime. Models of
strong coupling which explicitly include the spatial distribution of emitters
can account for these effects. Such gratings form a new system for exploring
the rich physics of polaritons and the interplay between their near- and

population can make more comprehensive measurement challenging. With a
population of only six million people and an Internet penetration rate of only
38%, it is challenging to either recruit in-country volunteers or obtain

over-blocking rules causing incidental filtering of more than 5.4M domains.
Finally, we use Geneva, an open-source censorship evasion tool, to discover
five new censorship evasion strategies that can defeat Turkmenistan's
censorship at both transport and application layers. We will publicly release

$(k,\varepsilon)$-secluded partition if, for every $\vec{p} \in \mathbb{R}^d$,
the ball $\overline{B}_{\infty}(\varepsilon, \vec{p})$ intersects at most $k$
members of $\mathcal{P}$. A goal in designing such secluded partitions is to
minimize $k$ while making $\varepsilon$ as large as possible. This partition
problem has connections to a diverse range of topics, including deterministic
rounding schemes, pseudodeterminism, replicability, as well as Sperner/KKM-type
results.
  In this work, we establish near-optimal relationships between $k$ and
$\varepsilon$. We show that, for any bounded measure partitions and for any
$d\geq 1$, it must be that $k\geq(1+2\varepsilon)^d$. Thus, when $k=k(d)$ is
restricted to ${\rm poly}(d)$, it follows that $\varepsilon=\varepsilon(d)\in
O\left(\frac{\ln d}{d}\right)$. This bound is tight up to log factors, as it is
known that there exist secluded partitions with $k(d)=d+1$ and
$\varepsilon(d)=\frac{1}{2d}$. We also provide new constructions of secluded
partitions that work for a broad spectrum of $k(d)$ and $\varepsilon(d)$

$O(\log d)$ factors for various choices of $k(d)$ and $\varepsilon(d)$. Based
on the lower bound result, we establish a new neighborhood version of Sperner's

a no-free-lunch theorem about the limitations of rounding schemes in the

  Plasmas","117 pages, 42 figures",,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Kinetic Alfv\'en Waves (KAWs) are generated in magnetized space and
laboratory plasmas due to a continuous shear Alfv\'en wave (SAW) spectrum and,
unlike SAWs, are characterized by microscale perpendicular structures of the
order of the thermal ion Larmor radius. This has important consequences on
heating, acceleration and transport processes connected with KAWs.
Historically, KAWs generation by mode conversion of SAWs in laboratory plasmas
and their strong damping/absorption right after SAW mode conversion have been
investigated for plasma heating. Here, we focus on the opposite limit: a mode
converted KAW weakly absorbed in a periodic magnetized plasma cylinder. We show
that a KAW may be excited as resonant cavity mode in the region between the
magnetic axis and the SAW resonant layer generated externally by an antenna
launcher; this process is qualitatively similar to mode converted electron
Bernstein waves. In this way, large amplitude KAWs may be generated time
asymptotically with relatively small coupled antenna power. This case has
little or no relevance for plasma heating but interesting nonlinear
implications for plasma equilibrium. In particular, we demonstrate that KAWs
may generate convective cells (CCs) by modulational instability, that a
consequence of plasma nonuniformity is the azimuthal symmetry breaking due to
plasma diamagnetic effects, that the modulational instability growth rate is
enhanced over the corresponding uniform plasma limit, that the unstable
parameter space is extended, and that the cylindrical geometry causes a complex
interplay between nonlinearity and nonuniformity. As a result, we show that it
is possible to control the CC radial structures and the corresponding parallel
electric field generation not only by means of the antenna frequency but also
by fine tuning of its amplitude.

After reviewing available options, we select and approach based on the

Navier-Stokes equations supplemented with a turbulence model to predict the
velocity and pressure fields in both fluids. We examine the formal and physical

solves a transport equation for the eddy viscosity. For this purpose, we assume
the interface to behave as a rigid wall with respect to turbulent fluctuations
in the air, and implement a versatile algorithm to compute the local distance
to the interface whatever its shape. We first assess the performance of this
model in the single-phase configuration of flow over a wavy rigid wall, which
is of specific relevance with respect to wind-wave generation. Then, we discuss
the initialization protocol used in two-phase simulations, which involves a
white noise distribution applied to the interface position. We finally present

for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, finding a set of
neural network parameters that lead to fulfilling a PDE can be challenging and
non-unique due to the complexity of the loss landscape that needs to be
traversed. Although a variety of multi-task learning and transfer learning
approaches have been proposed to overcome these issues, there is no incremental
training procedure for PINNs that can effectively mitigate such training
challenges. We propose incremental PINNs (iPINNs) that can learn multiple tasks
(equations) sequentially without additional parameters for new tasks and
improve performance for every equation in the sequence. Our approach learns
multiple PDEs starting from the simplest one by creating its own subnetwork for
each PDE and allowing each subnetwork to overlap with previously learned
subnetworks. We demonstrate that previous subnetworks are a good initialization
for a new equation if PDEs share similarities. We also show that iPINNs achieve
lower prediction error than regular PINNs for two different scenarios: (1)
learning a family of equations (e.g., 1-D convection PDE); and (2) learning
PDEs resulting from a combination of processes (e.g., 1-D reaction-diffusion
PDE). The ability to learn all problems with a single network together with
learning more complex PDEs with better generalization than regular PINNs will
open new avenues in this field.

the convex hull of the graph of $f$, which can be difficult for complicated

Essentially, later layers go through the normal gradient descent process, while
the early layers go through short stints of gradient ascent followed by

the standard way to do this. We report on the first application of the
\texttt{SKIRT} radiative transfer code to simulations of a star-forming cloud.
The synthetic observations are then analyzed following traditional
observational workflows. We find that in the early stages of the simulation,
stellar radiation is inefficient in heating dust to the temperatures observed
in Galactic clouds, thus the addition of an interstellar radiation field is
necessary. The spectral energy distribution of the cloud settles rather quickly
after $\sim3$ Myr of evolution from the onset of star formation, but its
morphology continues to evolve for $\sim8$ Myr due to the expansion of
\textsc{Hii} regions and the respective creation of cavities, filaments, and
ridges. Modeling synthetic \textit{Herschel} fluxes with 1- or 2-component
modified black bodies underestimates total dust masses by a factor of $\sim2$.
Spatially-resolved fitting recovers up to about $70\%$ of the intrinsic value.
This ``missing mass'' is located in a very cold dust component with
temperatures below $10$ K, which does not contribute appreciably to the
far-infrared flux. This effect could bias real observations if such dust exists
in large amounts. Finally, we tested observational calibrations of the SFR
based on infrared fluxes and concluded that they are in agreement when compared

lunar recession than previously thought, and that the Moon was probably still
at the distance of $\sim$7-9 Earth radii at the end of solidification. This
limited early recession aggravates the often overlooked difficulty of modeling
tidal dissipation in Earth's first billion years, but it also offers a new
possibility of resolving the lunar inclination problem by allowing the
operation of multiple excitation mechanisms.

on multileg attractive-$U$ Hubbard ladders. Using exact diagonalization and
density matrix renormalization group method simulations, we construct grand
canonical phase diagrams for ladder widths of up to $W=5$ and varying
perpendicular geometries, characterizing the quasi-one-dimensional regime of
the dimensional crossover. We unveil a multicritical point marking the onset of
partial polarization in those phase diagrams, a candidate regime of
finite-momentum pairing. We compare our findings with recent experimental and
theoretical studies of quasi-one-dimensional polarized Fermi gases.

"2304.04868","Chao Cheng","Chao Cheng, Donna Spiegelman, Fan Li","Causal mediation analysis with a failure time outcome in the presence of
  exposure measurement error",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Causal mediation analysis is widely used in health science research to
evaluate the extent to which an intermediate variable explains an observed
exposure-outcome relationship. However, the validity of analysis can be
compromised when the exposure is measured with error, which is common in health
science studies. This article investigates the impact of exposure measurement
error on assessing mediation with a failure time outcome, where a Cox
proportional hazard model is considered for the outcome. When the outcome is
rare with no exposure-mediator interaction, we show that the unadjusted
estimators of the natural indirect and direct effects can be biased into either
direction, but the unadjusted estimator of the mediation proportion is
approximately unbiased as long as measurement error is not large or the
mediator-exposure association is not strong. We propose ordinary regression
calibration and risk set regression calibration approaches to correct the
exposure measurement error-induced bias in estimating mediation effects and to
allow for an exposure-mediator interaction in the Cox outcome model. The
proposed approaches require a validation study to characterize the measurement
error process between the true exposure and its error-prone counterpart. We
apply the proposed approaches to the Health Professionals Follow-up study to
evaluate extent to which body mass index mediates the effect of vigorous
physical activity on the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and assess the
finite-sample properties of the proposed estimators via simulations.

for an infrared-optimized space telescope with an aperture of at least $4m$.
With the support of their governments in the US, Europe, and Canada, 20,000
people realized that vision as the $6.5m$ James Webb Space Telescope. A
generation of astronomers will celebrate their accomplishments for the life of
the mission, potentially as long as 20 years, and beyond. This report and the
scientific discoveries that follow are extended thank-you notes to the 20,000
team members. The telescope is working perfectly, with much better image

history, describe the observatory, outline its objectives and current observing
program, and discuss the inventions and people who made it possible. We cite
detailed reports on the design and the measured performance on orbit.

tropicalization of algebraic varieties defined over a non-Archimedean field, we
introduce an algebraic process for the tropicalization of schemes and Zariski
sheaves of rings and of modules over them. For us, tropicalization is
understood in the broader sense of a process that associates idempotent
algebraic objects to the usual ones from algebraic geometry.
  This goal is achieved by first building the affine case and then globalizing
the construction in a functorial way for a fixed affine open covering of a
given scheme. Our constructions are possible thanks to the algebraic
interpretation of order-theoretic structures through the theory of commutative
algebra for idempotent semirings.
  We define the notions of realizable semirings and realizable semimodules, and
we show that they are suitable for our formalism due to the fact that their
lattices of subobjects are, in a precise way, a combinatorial reflection of

  Amplification Assessment",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Most pre-trained learning systems are known to suffer from bias, which
typically emerges from the data, the model, or both. Measuring and quantifying
bias and its sources is a challenging task and has been extensively studied in
image captioning. Despite the significant effort in this direction, we observed
that existing metrics lack consistency in the inclusion of the visual signal.
In this paper, we introduce a new bias assessment metric, dubbed
$ImageCaptioner^2$, for image captioning. Instead of measuring the absolute
bias in the model or the data, $ImageCaptioner^2$ pay more attention to the
bias introduced by the model w.r.t the data bias, termed bias amplification.
Unlike the existing methods, which only evaluate the image captioning
algorithms based on the generated captions only, $ImageCaptioner^2$
incorporates the image while measuring the bias. In addition, we design a
formulation for measuring the bias of generated captions as prompt-based image
captioning instead of using language classifiers. Finally, we apply our
$ImageCaptioner^2$ metric across 11 different image captioning architectures on
three different datasets, i.e., MS-COCO caption dataset, Artemis V1, and
Artemis V2, and on three different protected attributes, i.e., gender, race,
and emotions. Consequently, we verify the effectiveness of our
$ImageCaptioner^2$ metric by proposing AnonymousBench, which is a novel human
evaluation paradigm for bias metrics. Our metric shows significant superiority
over the recent bias metric; LIC, in terms of human alignment, where the
correlation scores are 80% and 54% for our metric and LIC, respectively. The

that only 2D-based weak supervision is allowed when obtaining the 3D

overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition (DD) preconditioner that couples a
classical one-level overlapping Schwarz preconditioner with an
energy-minimizing coarse space. When used to accelerate the convergence rate of
Krylov subspace iterative methods, the GDSW preconditioner provides robustness
and scalability for the solution of sparse linear systems arising from the
discretization of a wide range of partial different equations. In this paper,
we present FROSch (Fast and Robust Schwarz), a domain decomposition solver
package which implements GDSW-type preconditioners for both CPU and GPU
clusters. To improve the solver performance on GPUs, we use a novel
decomposition to run multiple MPI processes on each GPU, reducing both solver's
computational and storage costs and potentially improving the convergence rate.
This allowed us to obtain competitive or faster performance using GPUs compared
to using CPUs alone. We demonstrate the performance of FROSch on the Summit
supercomputer with NVIDIA V100 GPUs, where we used NVIDIA Multi-Process Service
(MPS) to implement our decomposition strategy.
  The solver has a wide variety of algorithmic and implementation choices,
which poses both opportunities and challenges for its GPU implementation. We
conduct a thorough experimental study with different solver options including
the exact or inexact solution of the local overlapping subdomain problems on a
GPU. We also discuss the effect of using the iterative variant of the
incomplete LU factorization and sparse-triangular solve as the approximate
local solver, and using lower precision for computing the whole FROSch
preconditioner. Overall, the solve time was reduced by factors of about
$2\times$ using GPUs, while the GPU acceleration of the numerical setup time
depend on the solver options and the local matrix sizes.

Unfortunately, their performance dramatically drops on the real scan data since
they are supervised only on synthetic datasets. The point-wise annotation of
ground truth normals is vulnerable to inefficiency and inaccuracies, which
totally makes it impossible to build perfect real datasets for supervised deep
learning. To overcome the challenge, we propose a multi-sample consensus
paradigm for unsupervised normal estimation. The paradigm consists of
multi-candidate sampling, candidate rejection, and mode determination. The
latter two are driven by neighbor point consensus and candidate consensus
respectively. Two primary implementations of the paradigm, MSUNE and MSUNE-Net,
are proposed. MSUNE minimizes a candidate consensus loss in mode determination.
As a robust optimization method, it outperforms the cutting-edge supervised
deep learning methods on real data at the cost of longer runtime for sampling
enough candidate normals for each query point. MSUNE-Net, the first
unsupervised deep normal estimator as far as we know, significantly promotes
the multi-sample consensus further. It transfers the three online stages of
MSUNE to offline training. Thereby its inference time is 100 times faster.
Besides that, more accurate inference is achieved, since the candidates of
query points from similar patches can form a sufficiently large candidate set
implicitly in MSUNE-Net. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the two
proposed unsupervised methods are noticeably superior to some supervised deep
normal estimators on the most common synthetic dataset. More importantly, they
show better generalization ability and outperform all the SOTA conventional and
deep methods on three real datasets: NYUV2, KITTI, and a dataset from PCV [1].

study two methods to achieve a probabilistic entanglement concentration for

reasonably good probability of success at the expense of having a non-maximal

considering a tradeoff between the amount of entanglement (quantified by the
I-Concurrence) of the final state after the concentration procedure and its
success probability, which leads to solving a quadratic optimization problem.
We found an analytical solution, ensuring that an optimal scheme for
entanglement concentration can always be found in terms of $\mathcal{Q}$.
Finally, a second method was explored, which is based on fixing the success

[R. O. Vallejos, F. de Melo, and G. G. Carlo, Phys. Rev. A 104, 012602 (2021)]
as a way to benchmark the complexity within reach of quantum processors. By
considering specific architectures and native gate sets of currently available
technologies, we numerically simulate and characterize the operation of various
quantum processors. We characterize their complexity for different native gate
sets, qubit connectivity and increasing number of gates. We identify and assess
quantum complexity by comparing the performance of each device against
benchmark lines provided by randomized Clifford circuits and Haar-random pure
states. In this way, we are able to specify, for each specific processor, the
number of native quantum gates which are necessary, on average, for achieving
those levels of complexity. Lastly, we study the performance of the
majorization-based characterization in the presence of distinct types of noise.
We find that the majorization-based benchmark holds as long as the circuits'
output states have, on average, high purity ($\gtrsim 0.9$). In such cases, the
indicator showed no significant differences from the noiseless case.

nonrigidly? We used rotating rigid objects that can appear rigid or non-rigid
to test whether shape features contribute to rigidity perception. When two
circular rings were rigidly linked at an angle and jointly rotated at moderate
speeds, observers reported that the rings wobbled and were not linked rigidly
but rigid rotation was reported at slow speeds. When gaps, paint or vertices
were added, the rings appeared rigidly rotating even at moderate speeds. At
high speeds, all configurations appeared non-rigid. Salient features thus
contribute to rigidity at slow and moderate speeds, but not at high speeds.
Simulated responses of arrays of motion-energy cells showed that motion flow
vectors are predominantly orthogonal to the contours of the rings, not parallel
to the rotation direction. A convolutional neural network trained to
distinguish flow patterns for wobbling versus rotation, gave a high probability
of wobbling for the motion-energy flows. However, the CNN gave high
probabilities of rotation for motion flows generated by tracking features with
arrays of MT pattern-motion cells and corner detectors. In addition, circular
rings can appear to spin and roll despite the absence of any sensory evidence,
and this illusion is prevented by vertices, gaps, and painted segments, showing
the effects of rotational symmetry and shape. Combining CNN outputs that give
greater weight to motion energy at fast speeds and to feature tracking at slow,
with the shape-based priors for wobbling and rolling, explained rigid and
nonrigid percepts across shapes and speeds (R2=0.95). The results demonstrate
how cooperation and competition between different neuronal classes lead to
specific states of visual perception and to transitions between the states.

navigate through the environment based on natural language instructions. At
each step, the agent takes the next action by selecting from a set of navigable
locations. In this paper, we aim to take one step further and explore whether
the agent can benefit from generating the potential future view during
navigation. Intuitively, humans will have an expectation of how the future
environment will look like, based on the natural language instructions and
surrounding views, which will aid correct navigation. Hence, to equip the agent
with this ability to generate the semantics of future navigation views, we
first propose three proxy tasks during the agent's in-domain pre-training:
Masked Panorama Modeling (MPM), Masked Trajectory Modeling (MTM), and Action
Prediction with Image Generation (APIG). These three objectives teach the model
to predict missing views in a panorama (MPM), predict missing steps in the full
trajectory (MTM), and generate the next view based on the full instruction and
navigation history (APIG), respectively. We then fine-tune the agent on the VLN
task with an auxiliary loss that minimizes the difference between the view
semantics generated by the agent and the ground truth view semantics of the
next step. Empirically, our VLN-SIG achieves the new state-of-the-art on both
the Room-to-Room dataset and the CVDN dataset. We further show that our agent
learns to fill in missing patches in future views qualitatively, which brings
more interpretability over agents' predicted actions. Lastly, we demonstrate
that learning to predict future view semantics also enables the agent to have
better performance on longer paths.

probabilistic system architecture, describing the main aspects of the system

was conducted to validate the ability of the system to reliably convey target
emotions to listeners. The findings indicate that AffectMachine-Classical is
very effective in communicating various levels of Arousal ($R^2 = .96$) to
listeners, and is also quite convincing in terms of Valence (R^2 = .90). Future
work will embed AffectMachine-Classical into biofeedback systems, to leverage
the efficacy of the affective music for emotional well-being in listeners.

involves estimating parameters of agent reward functions (also known as
""structural"" parameters), using agent behavioral data. Maximum likelihood
estimation for such models requires dynamic programming, which is limited by
the curse of dimensionality. In this work, we present a novel algorithm that
provides a data-driven method for selecting and aggregating states, which
lowers the computational and sample complexity of estimation. Our method works
in two stages. In the first stage, we use a flexible inverse reinforcement
learning approach to estimate agent Q-functions. We use these estimated
Q-functions, along with a clustering algorithm, to select a subset of states
that are the most pivotal for driving changes in Q-functions. In the second
stage, with these selected ""aggregated"" states, we conduct maximum likelihood
estimation using a commonly used nested fixed-point algorithm. The proposed
two-stage approach mitigates the curse of dimensionality by reducing the
problem dimension. Theoretically, we derive finite-sample bounds on the
associated estimation error, which also characterize the trade-off of
computational complexity, estimation error, and sample complexity. We
demonstrate the empirical performance of the algorithm in two classic dynamic
discrete choice estimation applications.

main (wide) and ultra-wide cameras. The goal is to recover sharp details from
defocused regions in the main-camera photo with the help of the
ultra-wide-camera one. The camera setting poses new challenges such as
parallax-induced occlusions and inconsistent color between cameras. To overcome
the challenges, we introduce a predict-and-refine network to mitigate
occlusions and propose dynamic frequency-domain alignment for color correction.
To enable effective training and evaluation, we also build an AIF dataset with
2686 unique scenes. Each scene includes two photos captured by the main camera,
one photo captured by the ultrawide camera, and a synthesized AIF photo.

essential field operations such as training, pruning, blossom and green fruit

available for large-scale blossom thinning such approaches often yield
unpredictable thinning results and may cause damage the canopy, spurs, and leaf

manual hand blossom thinning for desired thinning outcomes. This research
presents a robotic solution for blossom thinning in apple orchards using a
computer vision system with artificial intelligence, a six degrees of freedom
robotic manipulator, and an electrically actuated miniature end-effector for
robotic blossom thinning. The integrated robotic system was evaluated in a
commercial apple orchard which showed promising results for targeted and
selective blossom thinning. Two thinning approaches, center and boundary
thinning, were investigated to evaluate the system ability to remove varying
proportion of flowers from apple flower clusters. During boundary thinning the
end effector was actuated around the cluster boundary while center thinning
involved end-effector actuation only at the cluster centroid for a fixed
duration of 2 seconds. The boundary thinning approach thinned 67.2% of flowers
from the targeted clusters with a cycle time of 9.0 seconds per cluster,
whereas center thinning approach thinned 59.4% of flowers with a cycle time of
7.2 seconds per cluster. When commercially adopted, the proposed system could

from the formation of nearly flat dispersions close to the Fermi level, where
electron correlations induce strong orbital-selective renormalization and
manifestation of the kagome-frustrated bands. In addition, a significant
negative magnetoresistance signal is observed, which can be attributed to the
suppression of flat-band-induced ferromagnetic fluctuation, which further
supports the formation of flat bands in this compound. These findings broaden a

has emerged as a critical process to remove the influence of specific examples
from a given model. Although exact unlearning can be achieved through complete
model retraining using the remaining dataset, the associated computational
costs have driven the development of efficient, approximate unlearning
techniques. Moving beyond data-centric MU approaches, our study introduces a
novel model-based perspective: model sparsification via weight pruning, which
is capable of reducing the gap between exact unlearning and approximate
unlearning. We show in both theory and practice that model sparsity can boost
the multi-criteria unlearning performance of an approximate unlearner, closing
the approximation gap, while continuing to be efficient. This leads to a new MU
paradigm, termed prune first, then unlearn, which infuses a sparse model prior
into the unlearning process. Building on this insight, we also develop a
sparsity-aware unlearning method that utilizes sparsity regularization to
enhance the training process of approximate unlearning. Extensive experiments
show that our proposals consistently benefit MU in various unlearning
scenarios. A notable highlight is the 77% unlearning efficacy gain of
fine-tuning (one of the simplest unlearning methods) when using sparsity-aware

  Reconstruction","Accepted review paper for Chinese Physics B",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Wavefunction is a fundamental concept of quantum theory. Recent studies have
shown surprisingly that wavefunction can be directly reconstructed via the
measurement of weak value. The weak value based direct wavefunction
reconstruction not only gives the operational meaning of wavefunction, but also
provides the possibility of realizing holographic imaging with a totally new
quantum approach. Here, we review the basic background knowledge of weak value
based direct wavefunction reconstruction combined with recent experimental
demonstrations. The main purpose of this work focuses on the idea of
holographic imaging via direct wavefunction reconstruction. Since research on
this topic is still in its early stage, we hope that this work can attract
interest in the field of traditional holographic imaging. In addition, the
wavefunction holographic imaging may find important applications in quantum

given an ellipsoid $E_{A,\rho}=\{Ax: \Vert x \Vert \leq \rho\}$, in each
iteration it either computes successively improving approximation $b_k=Ax_k \in
E_{A,\rho}$, or proves $b \not \in E_{A, \rho}$. We then extend TA for

$F_1(r)=r-(r^THr/r^TH^2r)Hr$, where $H=A$ when $A$ is symmetric PSD, otherwise
$H=AA^T$ but need not be computed explicitly. More generally, CTA extends to a
family of iteration function, $F_t( r)$, $t=1, \dots, m$ satisfying: On the one

element method on quadrilateral meshes for linear elasticity that is based on
the stress-hybrid principle. We refer to this approach as the Stress-Hybrid
Virtual Element Method (SH-VEM). In this method, the Hellinger$-$Reissner
variational principle is adopted, wherein both the equilibrium equations and
the strain-displacement relations are variationally enforced. We consider
small-strain deformations of linear elastic solids in the compressible and
near-incompressible regimes over quadrilateral (convex and nonconvex) meshes.
Within an element, the displacement field is approximated as a linear
combination of canonical shape functions that are $\textit{virtual}$. The
stress field, similar to the stress-hybrid finite element method of Pian and
Sumihara, is represented using a linear combination of symmetric tensor
polynomials. A 5-parameter expansion of the stress field is used in each
element, with stress transformation equations applied on distorted
quadrilaterals. In the variational statement of the strain-displacement
relations, the divergence theorem is invoked to express the stress coefficients
in terms of the nodal displacements. This results in a formulation with solely
the nodal displacements as unknowns. Numerical results are presented for
several benchmark problems from linear elasticity. We show that SH-VEM is free
of volumetric and shear locking, and it converges optimally in the $L^2$ norm
and energy seminorm of the displacement field, and in the $L^2$ norm of the
hydrostatic stress.

slow reconstruction and low coverage. Cluster UAV systems offer greater
flexibility and wider coverage for map building. Existing methods of cluster
UAVs face challenges with accurate relative positioning, scale drift, and
high-speed dense point cloud map generation. To address these issues, we
propose a cluster framework for large-scale dense reconstruction and real-time
collaborative localization. The front-end of the framework is an improved
visual odometry which can effectively handle large-scale scenes. Collaborative
localization between UAVs is enabled through a two-stage joint optimization
algorithm and a relative pose optimization algorithm, effectively achieving
accurate relative positioning of UAVs and mitigating scale drift. Estimated
poses are used to achieve real-time dense reconstruction and fusion of point
cloud maps. To evaluate the performance of our proposed method, we conduct
qualitative and quantitative experiments on real-world data. The results
demonstrate that our framework can effectively suppress scale drift and
generate large-scale dense point cloud maps in real-time, with the

small memory QL is applicable to large-scale systems. Meanwhile, we present a

disjoint sets of size $\alpha$, and each item can only be cached in one set,
typically selected via a hash function. Set-associative caches are widely used
and have many benefits, e.g., in terms of latency or concurrency, over fully
associative caches, but they often incur more cache misses. As the set size
$\alpha$ decreases, the benefits increase, but the paging costs worsen.
  In this paper we characterize the performance of an $\alpha$-way
set-associative LRU cache of total size $k$, as a function of $\alpha =
\alpha(k)$. We prove the following, assuming that sets are selected using a
fully random hash function:
  - For $\alpha = \omega(\log k)$, the paging cost of an $\alpha$-way
set-associative LRU cache is within additive $O(1)$ of that a fully-associative
LRU cache of size $(1-o(1))k$, with probability $1 - 1/\operatorname{poly}(k)$,
for all request sequences of length $\operatorname{poly}(k)$.
  - For $\alpha = o(\log k)$, and for all $c = O(1)$ and $r = O(1)$, the paging
cost of an $\alpha$-way set-associative LRU cache is not within a factor $c$ of
that a fully-associative LRU cache of size $k/r$, for some request sequence of
length $O(k^{1.01})$.
  - For $\alpha = \omega(\log k)$, if the hash function can be occasionally
changed, the paging cost of an $\alpha$-way set-associative LRU cache is within
a factor $1 + o(1)$ of that a fully-associative LRU cache of size $(1-o(1))k$,
with probability $1 - 1/\operatorname{poly}(k)$, for request sequences of
arbitrary (e.g., super-polynomial) length.
  Some of our results generalize to other paging algorithms besides LRU, such

involves forecasting future body poses based on observed pose sequences. This
task is complex due to modeling spatial and temporal relationships. The most
commonly used models for this task are autoregressive models, such as recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) or variants, and Transformer Networks. However, RNNs
have several drawbacks, such as vanishing or exploding gradients. Other
researchers have attempted to solve the communication problem in the spatial
dimension by integrating Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) models. These works deal with temporal and spatial information
separately, which limits the effectiveness. To fix this problem, we propose a
novel approach called the multi-graph convolution network (MGCN) for 3D human
pose forecasting. This model simultaneously captures spatial and temporal
information by introducing an augmented graph for pose sequences. Multiple
frames give multiple parts, joined together in a single graph instance.
Furthermore, we also explore the influence of natural structure and
sequence-aware attention to our model. In our experimental evaluation of the
large-scale benchmark datasets, Human3.6M, AMSS and 3DPW, MGCN outperforms the
state-of-the-art in pose prediction.

is considered highly significant since it can utilize Vehicle-to-Everything
(V2X) communication among Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). CAVs can
transceive basic and/or advanced safety information, thereby improving
situational awareness at intersections. Although numerous studies have been

intersection crossing priorities. In the absence of RSU, there are some
distributed CIM methods that only rely on communication among CAVs for

the structure of the panoramic images while consistently translating their

in naive 360 panorama translation, we adopt spherical positional embedding to
our transformer encoders, introduce a distortion-free discriminator, and apply
sphere-based rotation for augmentation and its ensemble. We also design a
content encoder and a style encoder to be deformation-aware to deal with a
large domain gap between panoramas and pinhole images, enabling us to work on
diverse conditions of pinhole images. In addition, considering the large
discrepancy between panoramas and pinhole images, our framework decouples the
learning procedure of the panoramic reconstruction stage from the translation
stage. We show distinct improvements over existing I2I models in translating
the StreetLearn dataset in the daytime into diverse conditions. The code will

recent advances of deep learning, but it usually degrades significantly under
real-world noisy conditions. Recent works introduce speech enhancement (SE) as
front-end to improve speech quality, which is proved effective but may not be
optimal for downstream ASR due to speech distortion problem. Based on that,
latest works combine SE and currently popular self-supervised learning (SSL) to
alleviate distortion and improve noise robustness. Despite the effectiveness,
the speech distortion caused by conventional SE still cannot be completely
eliminated. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework named
Wav2code to implement a generalized SE without distortions for noise-robust
ASR. First, in pre-training stage the clean speech representations from SSL
model are sent to lookup a discrete codebook via nearest-neighbor feature
matching, the resulted code sequence are then exploited to reconstruct the
original clean representations, in order to store them in codebook as prior.
Second, during finetuning we propose a Transformer-based code predictor to
accurately predict clean codes by modeling the global dependency of input noisy
representations, which enables discovery and restoration of high-quality clean
representations without distortions. Furthermore, we propose an interactive
feature fusion network to combine original noisy and the restored clean
representations to consider both fidelity and quality, resulting in even more
informative features for downstream ASR. Finally, experiments on both synthetic
and real noisy datasets demonstrate that Wav2code can solve the speech
distortion and improve ASR performance under various noisy conditions,
resulting in stronger robustness.

hole and is based upon the idea that regularizing the singularity requires
deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry which extend over horizon-sized
scales, as well as maximally negative radial pressure as an equation of state.
The frozen star has also been shown to be ultra-stable against perturbations; a
feature that can be attributed to the equation of state and corresponds to this
model mimicking a black hole in the limit $\hbar\to 0$ or, equivalently, the
limit of infinite Newton's constant. Here, we ``defrost'' the frozen star by
allowing its radial pressure to be perturbatively less negative than maximal.
This modification to the equation of state is implemented by appropriately
deforming the background metric so as to allow the frozen star to mimic a
quantum black hole at finite $\hbar$ and Newton's constant. As a consequence,
the defrosted star acquires a non-trivial spectrum of oscillatory
perturbations. To show this, we first use the Cowling approximation to obtain
generic equations for the energy density and pressure perturbations of a
static, spherically symmetric background with an anisotropic fluid. The
particular setting of a deformed frozen star is then considered, for which the
dispersion relation is obtained to leading order in terms of the deviation from
maximal pressure. The current results compare favorably with those obtained
earlier for the collapsed polymer model, whose strongly non-classical interior
is argued to provide a microscopic description of the frozen and defrosted star
geometries.

hard to explain, and difficult to scale cost-effectively. The IETF recent
standard called Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) seems promising to limit
the attack surface on IoT devices by formally specifying their intended network
behavior. In this paper, we use SDN to enforce and monitor the expected
behaviors of each IoT device, and train one-class classifier models to detect
volumetric attacks.
  Our specific contributions are fourfold. (1) We develop a multi-level
inferencing model to dynamically detect anomalous patterns in network activity
of MUD-compliant traffic flows via SDN telemetry, followed by packet inspection
of anomalous flows. This provides enhanced fine-grained visibility into
distributed and direct attacks, allowing us to precisely isolate volumetric
attacks with microflow (5-tuple) resolution. (2) We collect traffic traces
(benign and a variety of volumetric attacks) from network behavior of IoT
devices in our lab, generate labeled datasets, and make them available to the
public. (3) We prototype a full working system (modules are released as
open-source), demonstrates its efficacy in detecting volumetric attacks on
several consumer IoT devices with high accuracy while maintaining low false
positives, and provides insights into cost and performance of our system. (4)
We demonstrate how our models scale in environments with a large number of
connected IoTs (with datasets collected from a network of IP cameras in our
university campus) by considering various training strategies (per device unit
versus per device type), and balancing the accuracy of prediction against the
cost of models in terms of size and training time.

PBHs have been ruled out. However, they are still poorly constrained in the
mass ranges of $10^{-16} - 100 M_{\odot}$ (Belotsky et al. 2019). Fast radio
bursts (FRBs) are millisecond flashes of radio light of unknown origin mostly
from outside the Milky Way. Due to their short timescales, gravitationally
lensed FRBs, which are yet to be detected, have been proposed as a useful probe
for constraining the presence of PBHs in the mass window of $< 100M_{\odot}$
(Mu\~noz et al. 2016). Up to now, the most successful project in finding FRBs
has been CHIME. Due to its large field of view (FoV), CHIME is detecting at
least 600 FRBs since 2018. However, none of them is confirmed to be
gravitationally lensed (Leung et al. 2022). Taiwan plans to build a new
telescope, BURSTT dedicated to detecting FRBs. Its survey area will be 25 times
greater than CHIME. BURSTT can localize all of these FRBs through
very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). We estimate the probability to find
gravitationally lensed FRBs, based on the scaled redshift distribution from the
latest CHIME catalog and the lensing probability function from Mu\~noz et al.
(2016). BURSTT-2048 can detect ~ 24 lensed FRBs out of ~ 1,700 FRBs per annum.
With BURSTT's ability to detect nanosecond FRBs, we can constrain PBHs to form
a part of dark matter down to $10^{-4}M_{\odot}$.

fundamental models of games with incomplete information. We aim at three
desirable properties of equilibria. First, equilibria can be naturally realized
by introducing a mediator into games. Second, an equilibrium can be computed
efficiently in a distributed fashion. Third, any equilibrium in that class
approximately maximizes social welfare, as measured by the price of anarchy,
for a broad class of games. These three properties allow players to compute an
equilibrium and realize it via a mediator, thereby settling into a stable state
with approximately optimal social welfare. Our main result is the existence of
an equilibrium concept that satisfies these three properties.
  Toward this goal, we characterize various (non-equivalent) extensions of
correlated equilibria, collectively known as Bayes correlated equilibria. In
particular, we focus on communication equilibria (also known as coordination
mechanisms), which can be realized by a mediator who gathers each player's
private information and then sends correlated recommendations to the players.
We show that if each player minimizes a variant of regret called untruthful
swap regret in repeated play of Bayesian games, the empirical distribution of
these dynamics converges to a communication equilibrium. We present an
efficient algorithm for minimizing untruthful swap regret with a sublinear
upper bound, which we prove to be tight up to a multiplicative constant. As a
result, by simulating the dynamics with our algorithm, we can efficiently
compute an approximate communication equilibrium. Furthermore, we extend
existing lower bounds on the price of anarchy based on the smoothness arguments
from Bayes Nash equilibria to equilibria obtained by the proposed dynamics.

will be used. The NBI's core component is a negative hydrogen ion source, which
is based on a modular concept. Eight cylindrical drivers, each having a volume
of several liters, are attached to one common expansion and extraction region.
Within the drivers an inductively coupled plasma is sustained by an external
cylindrical coil at filling pressures not larger than 0.3 Pa. Radio frequency
(RF) generators operating at a driving frequency of 1 MHz feed the coils via a
matching network with powers of up to 100 kW per driver. These high powers
entail high voltages, which make the ion source prone to electrical breakdowns
and arcing, wherefore its reliability is reduced. Moreover, at the ITER
prototype RF ion source not more than 60% of the power is absorbed by the
plasma, whereas the rest is lost for heating the RF coil and conducting
structures of the driver. To optimize the power coupling in the prototype
source, a previously validated self-consistent fluid-electromagnetic model is
applied. The optimization studies reveal a complex interplay between network
losses (mainly caused by the skin effect and eddy currents), and nonlinear
plasma phenomena, such as the RF Lorentz force. The model demonstrates
promising optimization concepts for the RF coupling in future NBI ion sources.
In particular, by increasing the axial driver length and the driving frequency
it is possible to enhance the fraction of absorbed power to values around 90%.

variation-ratio reduction as a unified framework for privacy amplification
analyses in the shuffle model. This framework utilizes total variation bounds
of local messages and probability ratio bounds of other users' blanket
messages, converting them to indistinguishable levels. Our results indicate
that the framework yields tighter bounds for both single-message and
multi-message encoders (e.g., with local DP, local metric DP, or multi-message
randomizers). Specifically, for a broad range of local randomizers having
extremal probability design, our amplification bounds are precisely tight. We
also demonstrate that variation-ratio reduction is well-suited for parallel
composition in the shuffle model and results in stricter privacy accounting for
common sampling-based local randomizers. Our experimental findings show that,
compared to existing amplification bounds, our numerical amplification bounds
can save up to $30\%$ of the budget for single-message protocols, $75\%$ of the
budget for multi-message protocols, and $75\%$-$95\%$ of the budget for

with standard stellar evolution and supernovae enrichment. We present

decomposition-based methods are preferred or not in practice on some
non-separable large-scale problems, which have not been clearly pointed out in
many previous CC papers. Then, we formalize CC to a continuous game model via
simplification, but without losing its essential property. Different from
previous evolutionary game theory for CC, our new model provides a much simpler
but useful viewpoint to analyze its convergence, since only the pure Nash
equilibrium concept is needed and more general fitness landscapes can be
explicitly considered. Based on convergence analyses, we propose a hierarchical
decomposition strategy for better generalization, as for any decomposition

spin-wave and localized ""bullet"" modes are achieved and controlled by varying
the applied in-plane magnetic field and driving current. The minimum linewidth
shows a linear dependence on the actual temperature of the active area,
confirming single-mode dynamics based on the nonlinear theory of spin-torque
nano-oscillation with a single mode. The observed electrostatic gating tuning
oscillation frequency arises from voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy and
threshold current of SHNO via modification of the nonlinear damping and/or the
interfacial spin-orbit coupling of the magnetic multilayer. In contrast to
previously observed two-mode coexistence degrading the spectral purity in
Py/Pt-based SHNOs with a negligible IPMA, a single coherent spin-wave mode with
a low driven current can be achieved by selecting the ferromagnet layer with a
suitable IPMA because the nonlinear mode coupling can be diminished by bringing
in the PMA field to compensate the easy-plane shape anisotropy. Moreover, the
simulations demonstrate that the experimentally observed current and
gate-voltage modulation of auto-oscillation modes are also closely associated
with the nonlinear damping and mode coupling, which are determined by the
ellipticity of magnetization precession. The demonstrated nonlinear mode
coupling mechanism and electrical control approach of spin-wave modes could

jointly models the source, target, and mixed behavior sequences to highlight
the global and target preference and precisely model the triple correlation in

This study makes use of the new, full-depth Spitzer/IRAC [3.6] and [4.5]
imaging from the GOODS Re-ionization Era wide-Area Treasury from the Spitzer

flux estimated from the best-fit spectral energy distribution, and the observed
photometry in IRAC [3.6]. From these measurements, we build the H{\alpha} LF
and study its evolution providing the best constraints of this property at high
redshift, where spectroscopy of H{\alpha} is not yet available. Schechter
parameterizations of the H{\alpha} LF show a decreasing evolution of
{\Phi^\star} with redshift, increasing evolution in L{^\star}, and no
significant evolution in the faint-end slope at high z. We find that star
formation rates (SFRs) derived from H{\alpha} are higher than those derived
from the rest-frame UV for low SFR galaxies but the opposite happens for the
highest SFRs. This can be explained by lower mass galaxies (also lower SFR)
having, on average, rising star formation histories (SFHs), while at the
highest masses the SFHs may be declining. The SFR function is steeper, and
because of the excess SFR(H{\alpha}) compared to SFR(UV) at low SFRs, the SFR
density estimated from H{\alpha} is higher than the previous estimates based on
UV luminosities.

identifying when samples presented to a deployed model differ from those
observed at training time. Detecting so-called out-of-distribution (OoD)
samples is crucial in safety-critical applications such as robotically guided
retinal microsurgery, where distances between the instrument and the retina are
derived from sequences of 1D images that are acquired by an
instrument-integrated optical coherence tomography (iiOCT) probe.
  Methods: This work investigates the feasibility of using an OoD detector to
identify when images from the iiOCT probe are inappropriate for subsequent
machine learning-based distance estimation. We show how a simple OoD detector
based on the Mahalanobis distance can successfully reject corrupted samples
coming from real-world ex vivo porcine eyes.
  Results: Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach can successfully
detect OoD samples and help maintain the performance of the downstream task
within reasonable levels. MahaAD outperformed a supervised approach trained on
the same kind of corruptions and achieved the best performance in detecting OoD
cases from a collection of iiOCT samples with real-world corruptions.
  Conclusion: The results indicate that detecting corrupted iiOCT data through
OoD detection is feasible and does not need prior knowledge of possible
corruptions. Consequently, MahaAD could aid in ensuring patient safety during
robotically guided microsurgery by preventing deployed prediction models from
estimating distances that put the patient at risk.

Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been shown to be a suitable

along each neutrino trajectory and (2) conservation law associated with angular
moments, depending on boundary conditions, for each flavor of neutrinos. We

leads to poor quality force fields. We show that the HSIC correctly and quickly
identifies the most sensitive parameters, and that optimizations done using a
small number of sensitive parameters outperform those done using a higher
dimensional reasonable-user parameter selection. Optimizations using only
sensitive parameters: 1) converge faster, 2) have loss values comparable to
those found with the naive selection, 3) have similar accuracy in validation

an HSIC global sensitivity is a cheap optimization pre-processing step that has
both qualitative and quantitative benefits which can substantially simplify and

However, as the number of cascades increases, the improvements in
reconstruction tend to become marginal, indicating possible excess model
capacity. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an emerging technique to compress
these models, in which a trained deep teacher network is used to distill
knowledge to a smaller student network such that the student learns to mimic
the behavior of the teacher. Most KD methods focus on effectively training the
student with a pre-trained teacher unaware of the student model. We propose
SFT-KD-Recon, a student-friendly teacher training approach along with the
student as a prior step to KD to make the teacher aware of the structure and
capacity of the student and enable aligning the representations of the teacher
with the student. In SFT, the teacher is jointly trained with the unfolded
branch configurations of the student blocks using three loss terms -
teacher-reconstruction loss, student-reconstruction loss, and teacher-student
imitation loss, followed by KD of the student. We perform extensive experiments
for MRI acceleration in 4x and 5x under-sampling on the brain and cardiac
datasets on five KD methods using the proposed approach as a prior step. We
consider the DC-CNN architecture and setup teacher as D5C5 (141765 parameters),

Results show that (i) our approach consistently improves the KD methods with
improved reconstruction performance and image quality, and (ii) the student

has become a more remarkable and important topic. For the graph, a significant
challenge is that the topological properties of the nodes (e.g., locations,
roles) are unbalanced (topology-imbalance), other than the number of training
labeled nodes (quantity-imbalance). Existing studies on topology-imbalance
focus on the location or the local neighborhood structure of nodes, ignoring
the global underlying hierarchical properties of the graph, i.e., hierarchy. In
the real-world scenario, the hierarchical structure of graph data reveals
important topological properties of graphs and is relevant to a wide range of
applications. We find that training labeled nodes with different hierarchical
properties have a significant impact on the node classification tasks and
confirm it in our experiments. It is well known that hyperbolic geometry has a
unique advantage in representing the hierarchical structure of graphs.
Therefore, we attempt to explore the hierarchy-imbalance issue for node
classification of graph neural networks with a novelty perspective of
hyperbolic geometry, including its characteristics and causes. Then, we propose
a novel hyperbolic geometric hierarchy-imbalance learning framework, named

self-consistent term in SPIRiT is utilized to design a novel stochastic
differential equation (SDE) for diffusion process. Then $\textit{k}$-space data
can be interpolated directly during the reverse diffusion process, instead of
using CSM to separate and combine individual coil images. This method indicates
that the optimization model can be used to design SDE in diffusion models,
driving the diffusion process strongly conforming with the physics involved in
the optimization model, dubbed model-driven diffusion. The proposed
SPIRiT-Diffusion method was evaluated on a 3D joint Intracranial and Carotid

that conformational changes were detected but all factors contributing to the
SPR signal were not carefully considered, in addition to often using no or
improper controls. In the present work we used a very well-characterized

potassium ions folds into a two G-tetrad antiparallel G-quadruplex structure.
All terms contributing to the maximal expected SPR response, Rmax, in
particular the refractive index increment, RII, of both partners and the
fraction of immobilized TBA target available, ca, were experimentally assessed.
The resulting Rmax was then compared to the maximal experimental SPR response
for potassium ions binding to TBA using appropriate controls. Regardless how
the RIIs were measured, by SPR or refractometry, and how much TBA available for
interacting with potassium ions was considered, the theoretical and the
experimental SPR responses never matched, the former being always lower than
the latter. Using a straightforward experimental model system and by thoroughly

cannot be learned due to the limitation of GNNs. Thus, we also design a
temporal graph pooling layer to obtain a global graph-level representation for

information propagation, and temporal convolution are jointly learned in an

multi-modal networks may rely on just one modality due to the greedy nature of
learning. In turn, the imbalanced utilization of modalities can negatively
affect the generalization ability of a network. In this paper, we investigate
the utilization of SAR and optical data for urban mapping. To that end, a
dual-branch network architecture using intermediate fusion modules to share
information between the uni-modal branches is utilized. A cut-off mechanism in
the fusion modules enables the stopping of information flow between the
branches, which is used to estimate the network's dependence on SAR and optical

good performance can be achieved with conventional SAR-optical data fusion (F1

at high volume concentration, and a gas. One of the motivations of this work
concerns geophysics and more particularly the pyroclastic density currents
which are precisely mixtures of pyroclast and lithic fragments and air. They
are extremely destructive phenomena, capable of devastating urbanised areas,
and are known to propagate over long distances, even over almost flat
topography. Fluidisation of these dense granular flows by pore gas pressure is
one response that could explain this behaviour and must therefore be taken into
account in the models. Starting from a gas-solid mixing model and invoking the
compressibility of the gas, through a law of state, we rewrite the conservation
of mass equation of the gas phase into an equation on the pore gas pressure
whose net effect is to reduce the friction between the particles. The momentum
equation of the solid phase is completed by generic constitutive laws,
specified as in Schaeffer et al (2019, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 874,
926-951) by a yield function and a dilatancy function. Therefore, the
divergence of the velocity field, which reflects the ability of the granular
flow to expand or compress, depends on the volume fraction, pressure, strain
rate and inertial number. In addition, we require the dilatancy function to
describe the rate of volume change of the granular material near an isochoric
equilibrium state, i.e. at constant volume. This property ensures that the
volume fraction, which is the solution to the conservation of mass equation, is
positive and finite at all times. We also require that the non-isochoric
fluidised model is linearly stable and dissipates energy (over time). In this
theoretical framework, we derive the dilatancy models corresponding to
classical rheologies such as Drucker-Prager and $\mu$(I) (with or without
expansion effects). The main result of this work is to show that it is possible
to obtain non-isochoric and fluidised granular models satisfying all the
properties necessary to correctly account for the physics of granular flows and
being well-posed, at least linearly stable.

usually work in the partial SOC range under shallow-cycle conditions and follow
different degradation profiles with no labeled data available, thus making SOH
estimation challenging. To estimate shallow-cycle battery SOH, a novel
unsupervised deep transfer learning method is proposed to bridge different
domains using self-attention distillation module and multi-kernel maximum mean
discrepancy technique. The proposed method automatically extracts
domain-variant features from charge curves to transfer knowledge from the
large-scale labeled full cycles to the unlabeled shallow cycles. The CALCE and
SNL battery datasets are employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method to estimate the battery SOH for different SOC ranges, temperatures, and
discharge rates. The proposed method achieves a root-mean-square error within
2\% and outperforms other transfer learning methods for different SOC ranges.
When applied to batteries with different operating conditions and from
different manufacturers, the proposed method still exhibits superior SOH
estimation performance. The proposed method is the first attempt at accurately
estimating battery SOH under shallow-cycle conditions without needing a
full-cycle characteristic test.

Things (IoT) networks, which is used to infer event(s) and initiate actions to
affect an environment. This gives rise to concerns relating to data integrity
and provenance. One possible solution to address these concerns is to employ
blockchain. However, blockchain has high resource requirements, thereby making
it unsuitable for use on resource-constrained IoT devices. To this end, this
paper proposes a novel approach, called two-layer directed acyclic graph
(2LDAG), whereby IoT devices only store a digital fingerprint of data generated
by their neighbors. Further, it proposes a novel proof-of-path (PoP) protocol
that allows an operator or digital twin to verify data in an on-demand manner.
The simulation results show 2LDAG has storage and communication cost that is
respectively two and three orders of magnitude lower than traditional
blockchain and also blockchains that use a DAG structure. Moreover, 2LDAG
achieves consensus even when 49\% of nodes are malicious.

be used to study the properties of radio galaxies. However, with this rapid
increase in data volume, it has become unrealistic to manually process all of
the incoming data, which in turn led to the development of automated approaches
for data processing tasks, such as morphological classification. Deep learning
plays a crucial role in this automation process and it has been shown that
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can deliver good performance in the
morphological classification of radio galaxies. This paper investigates two
adaptations to the application of these CNNs for radio galaxy classification.
The first adaptation consists of using principal component analysis (PCA)
during preprocessing to align the galaxies' principal components with the axes
of the coordinate system, which will normalize the orientation of the galaxies.
This adaptation led to a significant improvement in the classification accuracy
of the CNNs and decreased the average time required to train the models. The
second adaptation consists of guiding the CNN to look for specific features
within the samples in an attempt to utilize domain knowledge to improve the
training process. It was found that this adaptation generally leads to a
stabler training process and in certain instances reduced overfitting within
the network, as well as the number of epochs required for training.

  Object Detection","Accepted to CVPR 23",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Two-stage object detectors generate object proposals and classify them to
detect objects in images. These proposals often do not contain the objects
perfectly but overlap with them in many possible ways, exhibiting great
variability in the difficulty levels of the proposals. Training a robust
classifier against this crop-related variability requires abundant training
data, which is not available in few-shot settings. To mitigate this issue, we
propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) based data generation model,
which is capable of generating data with increased crop-related diversity. The
main idea is to transform the latent space such latent codes with different
norms represent different crop-related variations. This allows us to generate
features with increased crop-related diversity in difficulty levels by simply
varying the latent norm. In particular, each latent code is rescaled such that
its norm linearly correlates with the IoU score of the input crop w.r.t. the
ground-truth box. Here the IoU score is a proxy that represents the difficulty
level of the crop. We train this VAE model on base classes conditioned on the
semantic code of each class and then use the trained model to generate features
for novel classes. In our experiments our generated features consistently
improve state-of-the-art few-shot object detection methods on the PASCAL VOC

information of the source image and imitate the motion of the driving image.
Most pioneering methods rely primarily on 2D representations and thus will
inevitably suffer from face distortion when large head rotations are
encountered. Recent works instead employ explicit 3D structural representations
or implicit neural rendering to improve performance under large pose changes.
Nevertheless, the fidelity of identity and expression is not so desirable,
especially for novel-view synthesis. In this paper, we propose HiDe-NeRF, which
achieves high-fidelity and free-view talking-head synthesis. Drawing on the
recently proposed Deformable Neural Radiance Fields, HiDe-NeRF represents the
3D dynamic scene into a canonical appearance field and an implicit deformation
field, where the former comprises the canonical source face and the latter
models the driving pose and expression. In particular, we improve fidelity from
two aspects: (i) to enhance identity expressiveness, we design a generalized
appearance module that leverages multi-scale volume features to preserve face
shape and details; (ii) to improve expression preciseness, we propose a
lightweight deformation module that explicitly decouples the pose and
expression to enable precise expression modeling. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed approach can generate better results than

recent literature, message passing can create bottlenecks in information
propagation and hinder global coordination. This drawback can become even more
problematic in tasks where high-level planning is crucial. In fact, in similar
scenarios, each modular policy - e.g., controlling a joint of a robot - would
request to coordinate not only for basic locomotion but also achieve high-level
goals, such as navigating a maze. A classical solution to avoid similar
pitfalls is to resort to hierarchical decision-making. In this work, we adopt
the Feudal Reinforcement Learning paradigm to develop agents where control
actions are the outcome of a hierarchical (pyramidal) message-passing process.
In the proposed Feudal Graph Reinforcement Learning (FGRL) framework,
high-level decisions at the top level of the hierarchy are propagated through a
layered graph representing a hierarchy of policies. Lower layers mimic the

response to this discovery, a new RMF model, ""NITR"" has been developed. The
NITR model's naturalness has been confirmed by assessing its validity for
various finite nuclei and nuclear matter (NM) properties, including
incompressibility, symmetry energy, and slope parameter values of 225.11,
31.69, and 43.86 MeV, respectively. These values satisfy the
empirical/experimental limits currently available. The maximum mass and
canonical radius of a neutron star (NS) calculated using the NITR model
parameters are 2.35 $M_\odot$ and 12.73 km, respectively, which fall within the
range of PSR J0952-0607 and the latest NICER limit. This study aims to test the
NITR model consistency by applying it to different systems and, consequently,
calibrate its validity extensively. Subsequently, the NITR model equation of
state (EOS) is employed to obtain the properties of a dark matter admixed
neutron star using two approaches: non-gravitational (single fluid) and
two-fluid. In the two-fluid model, the dark matter (DM) particles only interact
with each other via gravity rather than the nucleons. In both cases, the
equation of state becomes softer due to DM interactions, which reduces various
macroscopic properties such as maximum mass, radius, tidal deformability, etc.
Additionally, through the use of various observational data, efforts are made
to constraint the quantity of DM within the NS.

This is caused by temperature variations, and fits with several temperature
components could lead to smaller errors. We want to quantify the performance of
the standard model of a single MBB in comparison with some multi-component
models. We are interested in both the accuracy and computational cost. We
examine some cloud models relevant for interstellar medium studies. Synthetic
spectra are fitted with a single MBB, a sum of several MBBs, and a sum of fixed
spectral templates, but keeping the dust opacity spectral index fixed. When
observations are used at their native resolution, the beam convolution becomes
part of the fitting procedure. This increases the computational cost, but the
analysis of large maps is still feasible with direct optimisation or even with
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Compared to the single MBB fits,
multi-component models can show significantly smaller systematic errors, at the
cost of more statistical noise. The $\chi^2$ values of the fits are not a good
indicator of the accuracy of the $\tau$ estimates, due to the potentially
dominant role of the model errors. The single-MBB model also remains a valid
alternative if combined with empirical corrections to reduce its bias. It is
technically feasible to fit multi-component models to maps of millions of
pixels. However, the SED model and the priors need to be selected carefully,
and the model errors can only be estimated by comparing alternative models.

More and more heterogeneous trajectories with different representation forms,

high-dimensional human skeletons, need to be analyzed and forecasted. Among
these heterogeneous trajectories, interactions between different elements
within a frame of trajectory, which we call the ``Dimension-Wise
Interactions'', would be more complex and challenging. However, most previous
approaches focus mainly on a specific form of trajectories, which means these
methods could not be used to forecast heterogeneous trajectories, not to
mention the dimension-wise interaction. Besides, previous methods mostly treat
trajectory prediction as a normal time sequence generation task, indicating
that these methods may require more work to directly analyze agents' behaviors

new ``view'' for trajectory prediction to model and forecast trajectories
hierarchically according to different frequency portions from the spectral
domain to learn to forecast trajectories by considering their frequency
responses. Moreover, we try to expand the current trajectory prediction task by
introducing the dimension $M$ from ``another view'', thus extending its
application scenarios to heterogeneous trajectories vertically. Finally, we
adopt the bilinear structure to fuse two factors, including the frequency

transition-metal tetrachalcogenides, has drawn significant attention due to a
recent report on possible coexistence of two antagonistic phenomena,
superconductivity and magnetism below 2.5~K (Bera et. al, arXiv:2111.14525).
Here, we report a structural phase transition of the trimerized phase at
temperature, $T~\simeq$~145~K using Raman scattering, specific heat, and
electrical transport measurements. The temperature-dependent single-crystal
X-ray diffraction experiments establish the phase transition from a
high-temperature centrosymmetric to a low-temperature non-centrosymmetric
structure, belonging to the same tetragonal crystal family. The first-principle
calculation finds the aforementioned inversion symmetry-breaking structural
transition to be driven by the hybridization energy gain due to the off-centric
movement of the Ta atoms, which wins over the elastic energy loss.

dependent on the dimensions of NCs, with the blue shift up to 9 nm for the
smallest analyzed NCs. The magnitude of the blueshift is smaller than the

comparing the emission wavelengths obtained from the experiment and a rigorous
effective mass model we can fully attribute the observed variations to the

each 5-min time bin to one of two specific liquidity modes. One represents the

describes the regime driven by some exogenous events. Then we focus on the
moments where the liquidity mode switches from the former to the latter and
consider the news articles published nearby impactful. We apply naive Bayes on

produce sparse representations of a scene. However, as the number of camera
poses and features grows, refinement through bundle adjustment becomes
inefficient. Inspired by global motion averaging methods, we propose a new
bundle adjustment objective which does not rely on image features' reprojection
errors yet maintains precision on par with classical BA. Our method averages
over relative motions while implicitly incorporating the contribution of the
structure in the adjustment. To that end, we weight the objective function by
local hessian matrices - a by-product of local bundle adjustments performed on
relative motions (e.g., pairs or triplets) during the pose initialisation step.
Such hessians are extremely rich as they encapsulate both the features' random
errors and the geometric configuration between the cameras. These pieces of
information propagated to the global frame help to guide the final optimisation
in a more rigorous way. We argue that this approach is an upgraded version of
the motion averaging approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on both
photogrammetric datasets and computer vision benchmarks.

  Protocol","Submitted to IEEE for possible publication",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper investigates the effect of low-resolution analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) on device activity detection in massive machine-type
communications (mMTC). The low-resolution ADCs induce two challenges on the
device activity detection compared with the traditional setup with the
assumption of infinite ADC resolution. First, the codebook design for signal
quantization by the low-resolution ADC is particularly important since a good
design of the codebook can lead to small quantization error on the received
signal, which in turn has significant influence on the activity detector
performance. To this end, prior information about the received signal power is
needed, which depends on the number of active devices $K$. This is sharply
different from the activity detection problem in traditional setups, in which
the knowledge of $K$ is not required by the BS as a prerequisite. Second, the
covariance-based approach achieves good activity detection performance in
traditional setups while it is not clear if it can still achieve good
performance in this paper. To solve the above challenges, we propose a
communication protocol that consists of an estimator for $K$ and a detector for
active device identities: 1) For the estimator, the technical difficulty is
that the design of the ADC quantizer and the estimation of $K$ are closely
intertwined and doing one needs the information/execution from the other. We
propose a progressive estimator which iteratively performs the estimation of
$K$ and the design of the ADC quantizer; 2) For the activity detector, we
propose a custom-designed stochastic gradient descent algorithm to estimate the
active device identities. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the communication protocol.

MOND program into a robust theoretical framework. While many such theories can
explain the profile of galactic rotation curves, they usually cannot explain
the evolution 15 the primordial fluctuations and the formation of
large-scale-structures in the Universe. The Aether Scalar Tensor (AeST) theory
seems to have overcome this difficulty, thereby providing the first compelling
example of an extension of general relativity able to successfully challenge
the particle dark matter hypothesis. Here we study the phenomenology of this
theory in the quasistatic weak-field regime and specifically for the idealised
case of spherical isolated sources.
  We find the existence of three distinct gravitational regimes, that is,
Newtonian, MOND and a third regime characterised by the presence of
oscillations in the gravitational potential which do not exist in the
traditional MOND paradigm. We identify the transition scales between these
three regimes and discuss their dependence on the boundary conditions and other
parameters in the theory. Aided by analytical and numerical solutions, we
explore the dependence of these solutions on the theory parameters. Our results
could help in searching for interesting observable phenomena at low redshift

  User-configurable Privacy Defense",,,"10.1145/3579856.3582819",,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Federated learning (FL) provides a variety of privacy advantages by allowing
clients to collaboratively train a model without sharing their private data.
However, recent studies have shown that private information can still be leaked
through shared gradients. To further minimize the risk of privacy leakage,
existing defenses usually require clients to locally modify their gradients
(e.g., differential privacy) prior to sharing with the server. While these
approaches are effective in certain cases, they regard the entire data as a
single entity to protect, which usually comes at a large cost in model utility.
In this paper, we seek to reconcile utility and privacy in FL by proposing a
user-configurable privacy defense, RecUP-FL, that can better focus on the
user-specified sensitive attributes while obtaining significant improvements in
utility over traditional defenses. Moreover, we observe that existing inference
attacks often rely on a machine learning model to extract the private
information (e.g., attributes). We thus formulate such a privacy defense as an
adversarial learning problem, where RecUP-FL generates slight perturbations
that can be added to the gradients before sharing to fool adversary models. To
improve the transferability to un-queryable black-box adversary models,
inspired by the idea of meta-learning, RecUP-FL forms a model zoo containing a
set of substitute models and iteratively alternates between simulations of the
white-box and the black-box adversarial attack scenarios to generate
perturbations. Extensive experiments on four datasets under various adversarial
settings (both attribute inference attack and data reconstruction attack) show
that RecUP-FL can meet user-specified privacy constraints over the sensitive
attributes while significantly improving the model utility compared with
state-of-the-art privacy defenses.

inductive representation sampling of large experimentally determined spider web

First, by following a novice-expert paradigm (2 novice teachers & 2 experienced

expertise. As hypothesized, experienced teachers' GRI was lower, suggesting
that their more fine-graded organization of domain-specific knowledge allows
them to fixate more rapidly and frequently in the classroom. Second, we found
that the selected velocity threshold parameter alter and, in the worst case,

increasingly often a design goal of engineered computational systems--motivated

However, there is still a lot of fragmentation in the research panorama of the

adapt them for mobile devices, but their performance remains unsatisfactory in
some real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose PP-MobileSeg, a
semantic segmentation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on
mobile devices. PP-MobileSeg comprises three novel parts: the StrideFormer
backbone, the Aggregated Attention Module (AAM), and the Valid Interpolate
Module (VIM). The four-stage StrideFormer backbone is built with MV3 blocks and
strided SEA attention, and it is able to extract rich semantic and detailed
features with minimal parameter overhead. The AAM first filters the detailed
features through semantic feature ensemble voting and then combines them with
semantic features to enhance the semantic information. Furthermore, we proposed
VIM to upsample the downsampled feature to the resolution of the input image.
It significantly reduces model latency by only interpolating classes present in
the final prediction, which is the most significant contributor to overall
model latency. Extensive experiments show that PP-MobileSeg achieves a superior
tradeoff between accuracy, model size, and latency compared to other methods.
On the ADE20K dataset, PP-MobileSeg achieves 1.57% higher accuracy in mIoU than
SeaFormer-Base with 32.9% fewer parameters and 42.3% faster acceleration on
Qualcomm Snapdragon 855. Source codes are available at

classification-based DL. Therefore, we developed and evaluated a new
self-supervised attention-based weakly supervised regression method that
predicts continuous biomarkers directly from images in 11,671 patients across
nine cancer types. We tested our method for multiple clinically and
biologically relevant biomarkers: homologous repair deficiency (HRD) score, a
clinically used pan-cancer biomarker, as well as markers of key biological
processes in the tumor microenvironment. Using regression significantly
enhances the accuracy of biomarker prediction, while also improving the
interpretability of the results over classification. In a large cohort of
colorectal cancer patients, regression-based prediction scores provide a higher
prognostic value than classification-based scores. Our open-source regression
approach offers a promising alternative for continuous biomarker analysis in
computational pathology.

role for electromagnetic communication and sensing. Here, we propose a quantum
sensor to sensitively detect the electric field of the millimeter (mm) wave.
The quantum sensor consists of many surface-state electrons trapped
individually on liquid helium by a scalable electrode-network at the bottom of
the helium film. On such a chip, each of the trapped electrons can be
manipulated by the biased dc-current to deliver the strong spin-orbit
couplings. The mm wave signal to be detected is applied to non-dispersively
drive the orbital states of the trapped electrons, just resulting in the Stark
shifts of the dressed spin-orbital states. As a consequence, the electric field
of the applied mm wave could be detected sensitively by using the spin-echo
interferometry of the long-lived spin states of the electrons trapped on liquid
helium. The reasonable accuracy of the detection and also the feasibility of
the proposal are discussed.

ability of retrieving the globally optimal solution to outlier-affected
geometric problems. However, while the discovery of such solutions caries high
scientific value, its application in practical scenarios is often prohibited by
its computational complexity growing exponentially as a function of the
dimensionality of the problem at hand. In this work, we convey a novel, general
technique that allows us to branch over an $n-1$ dimensional space for an
n-dimensional problem. The remaining degree of freedom can be solved globally
optimally within each bound calculation by applying the efficient interval
stabbing technique. While each individual bound derivation is harder to compute
owing to the additional need for solving a sorting problem, the reduced number
of intervals and tighter bounds in practice lead to a significant reduction in
the overall number of required iterations. Besides an abstract introduction of
the approach, we present applications to three fundamental geometric computer
vision problems: camera resectioning, relative camera pose estimation, and
point set registration. Through our exhaustive tests, we demonstrate
significant speed-up factors at times exceeding two orders of magnitude,

humid air, leading to higher breakdown electric field and threshold field for

a faster decay of the conductivity in the streamer channel, which hinders the
accumulation of charge in the streamer head. In some cases a propagating
streamer solution still exists at the expense of a smaller radius and lower

streamer. We finally discuss how all these statements may affect streamer

missing widely exists in real-world applications. Although great progress has

is not reasonable to provide a single deterministic imputation. Second, the
quality of the imputed data itself is of high uncertainty. To explore and

controllable fusion. Specifically, we model each missing data with a
distribution conditioning on the available views and thus introducing
uncertainty. Then an evidence-based fusion strategy is employed to guarantee
the trustworthy integration of the imputed views. Extensive experiments are
conducted on multiple benchmark data sets and our method establishes a
state-of-the-art performance in terms of both performance and trustworthiness.

hard to specify a good fusion architecture, and consequently, the design of
fusion networks is still a black art, rather than science. To address this
problem, we formulate the fusion task mathematically, and establish a
connection between its optimal solution and the network architecture that can
implement it. This approach leads to a novel method proposed in the paper of
constructing a lightweight fusion network. It avoids the time-consuming
empirical network design by a trial-and-test strategy. In particular we adopt a
learnable representation approach to the fusion task, in which the construction
of the fusion network architecture is guided by the optimisation algorithm
producing the learnable model. The low-rank representation (LRR) objective is
the foundation of our learnable model. The matrix multiplications, which are at
the heart of the solution are transformed into convolutional operations, and
the iterative process of optimisation is replaced by a special feed-forward
network. Based on this novel network architecture, an end-to-end lightweight
fusion network is constructed to fuse infrared and visible light images. Its
successful training is facilitated by a detail-to-semantic information loss
function proposed to preserve the image details and to enhance the salient
features of the source images. Our experiments show that the proposed fusion
network exhibits better fusion performance than the state-of-the-art fusion

of electricity consumption. The long-term yearly trend is evaluated using
macroeconomic regression analysis. The mid-term model integrates temperature
and calendar regressors to describe the underlying structure, and combines
ARIMA and LSTM ``black-box'' pattern-based approaches to describe the error
term. The short-term model captures the hourly seasonality through calendar
regressors and multiple ARMA models for the residual. Results show that the
best forecasting model is composed by combining multiple regression models and
a LSTM hybrid model for residual prediction. Our hybrid model is very effective
at forecasting long-term electricity consumption on an hourly resolution. In
two years of out-of-sample forecasts with 17520 timesteps, it is shown to be
within 96.83 \% accuracy.

  self-supervised learning for anomaly detection on attributed graph",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anomaly detection on attributed graphs is a crucial topic for its practical
application. Existing methods suffer from semantic mixture and imbalance issue
because they mainly focus on anomaly discrimination, ignoring representation
learning. It conflicts with the assortativity assumption that anomalous nodes
commonly connect with normal nodes directly. Additionally, there are far fewer
anomalous nodes than normal nodes, indicating a long-tailed data distribution.
To address these challenges, a unique algorithm,Decoupled Self-supervised
Learning forAnomalyDetection (DSLAD), is proposed in this paper. DSLAD is a
self-supervised method with anomaly discrimination and representation learning
decoupled for anomaly detection. DSLAD employs bilinear pooling and masked
autoencoder as the anomaly discriminators. By decoupling anomaly discrimination
and representation learning, a balanced feature space is constructed, in which
nodes are more semantically discriminative, as well as imbalance issue can be
resolved. Experiments conducted on various six benchmark datasets reveal the
effectiveness of DSLAD.

pairwise summation using stochastic rounding (SR) in variance computation
algorithms. We estimate the forward error of computations under SR through two
methods: the first is based on a bound of the variance and
Bienaym{\'e}-Chebyshev inequality, while the second is based on martingales and
Azuma-Hoeffding inequality. The study shows that for pairwise summation, using
SR results in a probabilistic bound of the forward error proportional to
log(n)u rather than the deterministic bound in O(log(n)u) when using the
default rounding mode. We examine two algorithms that compute the variance,
called ''textbook'' and ''two-pass'', which both exhibit non-linear errors.
Using the two methods mentioned above, we show that these algorithms' forward
errors have probabilistic bounds under SR in O($\sqrt$ nu) instead of nu for
the deterministic bounds. We show that this advantage holds using pairwise
summation for both textbook and two-pass, with probabilistic bounds of the
forward error proportional to log(n)u.

results in a complexity at the receivers due to successive interference

SIC overhead and rely on simplistic power consumption models (PCM). To fill
this gap, we first introduce PCM-$\kappa$ that accounts for SIC-related power
expenditure, where $\kappa$ represents the average power consumption per SIC
layer. Then, to investigate the energy efficiency of NOMA and joint
transmission (JT)-CoMP NOMA, we formulate a power allocation problem for
maximizing the energy efficiency and consequently propose a global approach
running at a centralized entity and a local algorithm running at a base
station. We evaluate the energy efficiency using PCM-$\kappa$ and two PCMs
commonly used in the literature. Numerical analysis suggests that using
simplistic PCMs leads to a few orders of magnitude overestimation of energy
efficiency, especially when the receivers have low rate requirements. Despite
the superiority of JT-CoMP NOMA over conventional NOMA in finding a feasible
power allocation, the difference in their energy efficiency is only marginal.
Moreover, when conventional NOMA is feasible, the optimal solution for JT-CoMP
NOMA converges to conventional NOMA and NOMA schemes favour the users with the

attains local minimum at only finitely many pairs of points, we prove that each

Rips complexes, which represents a local minimum of $d$. We use this fact to
develop a theory (including interpretation) of critical edges of persistence.

computational interest is a simple geometric criterion recognizing local minima
of $d$ that induce a change in persistence. We conclude with a proof that each

dressing effectively moves the Dirac nodes away from their original position by
up to ~10% of the Brillouin zone (opening a large pseudo-gap in their original
position). The direction of the movement can be fully controlled by rotating
the laser polarization axis. We prove that this effect originates from band
nonlinearities away from the Dirac nodes (without which the effect completely
vanishes, and which are often neglected). We demonstrate that this physical
mechanism is applicable beyond two-dimensional Dirac semimetals, and can move
the positions of the valley minima in hexagonal materials to tune valley
selectivity, split and move Weyl cones in higher-order Weyl semimetals, and
merge Dirac nodes in three-dimensional topological Dirac semimetals. The model
results are validated with ab-initio time-dependent density functional theory

in practice, Adam, is based on heuristics. This paper builds a new framework
for deriving optimisation algorithms that explicitly leverage neural

details for deep fully-connected networks yields automatic gradient descent: a
first-order optimiser without any hyperparameters. Automatic gradient descent
trains both fully-connected and convolutional networks out-of-the-box and at

which Visorsat reduces its reflected light. Our results are as follows: (1) in

(2) the magnitude at 550 km altitude (normalized magnitude) of both satellites
often reaches the naked-eye limiting magnitude ($<$ 6.0); (3) from a blackbody
radiation model of the reflected flux, the peak of the reflected components of
both satellites is around the $z$ band; and (4) the albedo of the near infrared
range is larger than that of the optical range. Under the assumption that
Visorsat and STARLINK-1113 have the same reflectivity, we estimate the covering
factor, $C_{\rm f}$, of the sunshade on Visorsat, using the blackbody radiation
model: the covering factor ranges from $0.18 \leq C_{\rm f} \leq 0.92$. From
the multivariable analysis of the solar phase angle (Sun-target-observer), the
normalized magnitude, and the covering factor, the phase angle versus covering
factor distribution presents a moderate anti-correlation between them,
suggesting that the magnitudes of Visorsat depend not only on the phase angle
but also on the orientation of the sunshade along our line of sight. However,
the impact on astronomical observations from Visorsat-designed satellites
remains serious. Thus, new countermeasures are necessary for the Starlink
satellites to further reduce reflected sunlight.

privacy. To overcome them, we propose learning a

encoding to decide personalized hyperparameters. The client encoding is
calculated with a random projection-based procedure to protect each client's

CMB lensing power spectrum analysis of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data
release 6 (DR6) data. Two independent microwave sky simulations are used to
test a range of mitigation strategies. We demonstrate that finding and then
subtracting point sources, finding and then subtracting models of clusters, and
using a profile bias-hardened lensing estimator, together reduce the fractional
biases to well below statistical uncertainties, with the inferred lensing
amplitude, $A_{\mathrm{lens}}$, biased by less than $0.2\sigma$. We also show
that another method where a model for the cosmic infrared background (CIB)
contribution is deprojected and high frequency data from Planck is included has
similar performance. Other frequency-cleaned options do not perform as well,
incurring either a large noise cost, or resulting in biased recovery of the
lensing spectrum. In addition to these simulation-based tests, we also present
null tests performed on the ACT DR6 data which test for sensitivity of our
lensing spectrum estimation to differences in foreground levels between the two
ACT frequencies used, while nulling the CMB lensing signal. These tests pass
whether the nulling is performed at the map or bandpower level. The
CIB-deprojected measurement performed on the DR6 data is consistent with our
baseline measurement, implying contamination from the CIB is unlikely to
significantly bias the DR6 lensing spectrum. This collection of tests gives
confidence that the ACT DR6 lensing measurements and cosmological constraints
presented in companion papers to this work are robust to extragalactic
foregrounds.

strongest abnormalities determined by MEG and iEEG explained surgical outcome.
  Intracranial electrodes were implanted in brain tissue with the most abnormal
MEG findings in individuals that were seizure-free post-resection (T=3.9,

distinguished outcome groups moderately well (AUC=0.68). In isolation, the
resection of the strongest MEG and iEEG abnormalities separated surgical

  Intracranial EEG is a key tool to delineate the EZ and help render patients

Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized agents to jointly learn a global

not work for all devices due to the complexity of the actual deployment
environment and the heterogeneity of the data available on each device. In
addition, the deployment of TinyML hardware has significant computational and

TinyReptile on Raspberry Pi 4 and Cortex-M4 MCU with only 256-KB RAM. The

$9400$ sq. deg. of the sky. These lensing measurements are derived from the
Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) CMB dataset, which
consists of five seasons of ACT CMB temperature and polarization observations.
We determine the amplitude of the CMB lensing power spectrum at $2.3\%$
precision ($43\sigma$ significance) using a novel pipeline that minimizes
sensitivity to foregrounds and to noise properties. To ensure our results are
robust, we analyze an extensive set of null tests, consistency tests, and
systematic error estimates and employ a blinded analysis framework. The
baseline spectrum is well fit by a lensing amplitude of
$A_{\mathrm{lens}}=1.013\pm0.023$ relative to the Planck 2018 CMB power spectra
best-fit $\Lambda$CDM model and $A_{\mathrm{lens}}=1.005\pm0.023$ relative to
the $\text{ACT DR4} + \text{WMAP}$ best-fit model. From our lensing power
spectrum measurement, we derive constraints on the parameter combination
$S^{\mathrm{CMBL}}_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \left({\Omega_m}/{0.3}\right)^{0.25}$ of
$S^{\mathrm{CMBL}}_8= 0.818\pm0.022$ from ACT DR6 CMB lensing alone and
$S^{\mathrm{CMBL}}_8= 0.813\pm0.018$ when combining ACT DR6 and Planck NPIPE
CMB lensing power spectra. These results are in excellent agreement with
$\Lambda$CDM model constraints from Planck or $\text{ACT DR4} + \text{WMAP}$

$z\sim0.5$--$5$ are thus fully consistent with $\Lambda$CDM structure growth
predictions based on CMB anisotropies probing primarily $z\sim1100$. We find no
evidence for a suppression of the amplitude of cosmic structure at low
redshifts

fluctuations $\sigma_8 = 0.819 \pm 0.015$ at 1.8% precision,
$S_8\equiv\sigma_8({\Omega_{\rm m}}/0.3)^{0.5}=0.840\pm0.028$ and the Hubble
constant $H_0= (68.3 \pm 1.1)\, \text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ at

satellite yields even more precise values: $\sigma_8 = 0.812 \pm 0.013$,
$S_8\equiv\sigma_8({\Omega_{\rm m}}/0.3)^{0.5}=0.831\pm0.023$ and $H_0= (68.1

well with $\Lambda$CDM-model extrapolations from the CMB anisotropies measured
by Planck. To compare these constraints to those from the KiDS, DES, and HSC
galaxy surveys, we revisit those data sets with a uniform set of assumptions,
and find $S_8$ from all three surveys are lower than that from ACT+Planck
lensing by varying levels ranging from 1.7-2.1$\sigma$. These results motivate
further measurements and comparison, not just between the CMB anisotropies and
galaxy lensing, but also between CMB lensing probing $z\sim 0.5-5$ on
mostly-linear scales and galaxy lensing at $z\sim 0.5$ on smaller scales. We
combine our CMB lensing measurements with CMB anisotropies to constrain
extensions of $\Lambda$CDM, limiting the sum of the neutrino masses to $\sum
m_{\nu} < 0.12$ eV (95% c.l.), for example. Our results provide independent
confirmation that the universe is spatially flat, conforms with general
relativity, and is described remarkably well by the $\Lambda$CDM model, while
paving a promising path for neutrino physics with gravitational lensing from
upcoming ground-based CMB surveys.

multivariate forecasting models need to capture the relationship between the
channels to accurately predict future values. However, recently, there has been
an emergence of methods that employ the Channel Independent (CI) strategy.
These methods view multivariate time series data as separate univariate time
series and disregard the correlation between channels. Surprisingly, our
empirical results have shown that models trained with the CI strategy
outperform those trained with the Channel Dependent (CD) strategy, usually by a
significant margin. Nevertheless, the reasons behind this phenomenon have not
yet been thoroughly explored in the literature. This paper provides
comprehensive empirical and theoretical analyses of the characteristics of
multivariate time series datasets and the CI/CD strategy. Our results conclude
that the CD approach has higher capacity but often lacks robustness to
accurately predict distributionally drifted time series. In contrast, the CI
approach trades capacity for robust prediction. Practical measures inspired by
these analyses are proposed to address the capacity and robustness dilemma,
including a modified CD method called Predict Residuals with Regularization
(PRReg) that can surpass the CI strategy. We hope our findings can raise
awareness among researchers about the characteristics of multivariate time
series and inspire the construction of better forecasting models.

decompositional methods, which are those that consider the DNN's latent space
to extract more exact rule sets, manage to derive rule sets at high accuracy.
However, they a) do not guarantee that the surrogate model has learned from the

objective, such as accuracy, which can result in excessively large rule sets
(complexity), and c) use decision tree algorithms as intermediate models, which

introduces the CGX (Column Generation eXplainer) to address these limitations -
a decompositional method using dual linear programming to extract rules from

significant attention, pretraining these models before downstream tasks has
become a crucial step. The three key factors in pretraining foundation models
are the pretraining method, the size of the pretraining dataset, and the number
of model parameters. Recently, research in the remote sensing field has focused
primarily on the pretraining method and the size of the dataset, with limited
emphasis on the number of model parameters. This paper addresses this gap by
examining the effect of increasing the number of model parameters on the
performance of foundation models in downstream tasks such as rotated object
detection and semantic segmentation. We pretrained foundation models with
varying numbers of parameters, including 86M, 605.26M, 1.3B, and 2.4B, to
determine whether performance in downstream tasks improved with an increase in
parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first billion-scale
foundation model in the remote sensing field. Furthermore, we propose an
effective method for scaling up and fine-tuning a vision transformer in the
remote sensing field. To evaluate general performance in downstream tasks, we
employed the DOTA v2.0 and DIOR-R benchmark datasets for rotated object
detection, and the Potsdam and LoveDA datasets for semantic segmentation.
Experimental results demonstrated that, across all benchmark datasets and
downstream tasks, the performance of the foundation models and data efficiency
improved as the number of parameters increased. Moreover, our models achieve
the state-of-the-art performance on several datasets including DIOR-R, Postdam,

study to explore what happens to layer-wise pre-trained representations and
their encoded code knowledge during fine-tuning. We then propose efficient
alternatives to fine-tune the large pre-trained code model based on the above
findings. Our experimental study shows that (1) lexical, syntactic and
structural properties of source code are encoded in the lower, intermediate,
and higher layers, respectively, while the semantic property spans across the
entire model. (2) The process of fine-tuning preserves most of the code
properties. Specifically, the basic code properties captured by lower and
intermediate layers are still preserved during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we
find that only the representations of the top two layers change most during
fine-tuning for various downstream tasks. (3) Based on the above findings, we
propose Telly to efficiently fine-tune pre-trained code models via layer
freezing. The extensive experimental results on five various downstream tasks
demonstrate that training parameters and the corresponding time cost are
greatly reduced, while performances are similar or better. Replication package

dramatically given sparse input due to the implicitly reconstructed inaccurate

the epipolar, photometric consistency, depth smoothness, and
position-of-matches constraints to explicitly reconstruct the 3D-scene

NeRF, our method improves the view synthesis as well as the 3D-scene geometry

their very objective of playing the most rewarding arm as many times as
possible while ignoring the less rewarding ones among $N$ arms. In this paper,
we consider a fair prediction problem in the stochastic setting with hard lower
bounds on the rate of accrual of rewards for a set of arms. We study the
problem in both full and bandit feedback settings. Using queueing-theoretic
techniques in conjunction with adversarial learning, we propose a new online
prediction policy called $\texttt{BanditQ}$ that achieves the target reward
rates while achieving a regret and target rate violation penalty of
$O(T^{\frac{3}{4}}).$ In the full-information setting, the regret bound can be
further improved to $O(\sqrt{T})$ when considering the average regret over the
entire horizon of length $T$. The proposed policy is efficient and admits a
black-box reduction from the fair prediction problem to the standard MAB
problem with a carefully defined sequence of rewards. The design and analysis
of the $\texttt{BanditQ}$ policy involve a novel use of the potential function
method in conjunction with scale-free second-order regret bounds and a new
self-bounding inequality for the reward gradients, which are of independent

diffuses in a harmonic potential (with strength $k$) which is centered around
the origin. The center also serves as an absorbing boundary for the particle
and we denote the first passage time of the particle to the center as $t_f$. In
this set-up, we investigate the following functionals: (i) local time $T_{loc}

$x_R$ until the first passage, (ii) occupation or residence time $T_{res} =

investigation in space science and often requires very specialized equipment
for testing. In this work, we present the design, operational analysis and
application of a low-velocity ($\sim 100$ m/s) projectile impact framework for
evaluating the deformation and failure of space-grade materials. The system is
designed to be modular and easily adaptable to various test geometries, while
enabling accurate quantitative evaluation of plastic flow. Using coupled
numerical methods and experimental techniques, we first establish an operating
procedure for the system. Following this, its performance in two complementary
impact configurations is demonstrated using numerical and experimental
analysis. In the first, a Taylor impact test is performed for predicting the
deformed shape of a cylindrical projectile impinging on a rigid substrate. In
the second, deformation of a plate struck by a rigid projectile is evaluated.
In both cases, physics-based models are used to interpret the resulting fields.
We present a discussion of how the system may be used both for material
property estimation (e.g., dynamic yield strength) as well as for failure
evaluation (e.g., perforation and fracture) in the same projectile impact
configuration.

from their feedback, but still often suffer from model misalignment due to
missing or incorrectly learned features. When the features the robot needs to
learn to perform its task are missing or do not generalize well to new
settings, the robot will not be able to learn the task the human wants and,
even worse, may learn a completely different and undesired behavior. Prior work
shows how the robot can detect when its representation is missing some feature
and can, thus, ask the human to be taught about the new feature; however, these
works do not differentiate between features that are completely missing and
those that exist but do not generalize to new environments. In the latter case,
the robot would detect misalignment and simply learn a new feature, leading to
an arbitrarily growing feature representation that can, in turn, lead to
spurious correlations and incorrect learning down the line. In this work, we
propose separating the two sources of misalignment: we propose a framework for
determining whether a feature the robot needs is incorrectly learned and does
not generalize to new environment setups vs. is entirely missing from the
robot's representation. Once we detect the source of error, we show how the
human can initiate the realignment process for the model: if the feature is
missing, we follow prior work for learning new features; however, if the
feature exists but does not generalize, we use data augmentation to expand its
training and, thus, complete the correction. We demonstrate the proposed
approach in experiments with a simulated 7DoF robot manipulator and physical
human corrections.

heat source in the flow domain and, hence, a temperature gradient. The
nonuniform temperature distribution causes, in turn, a buoyancy force and a
combined forced and free flow regime. Dual mixed convection flows occur for a
given velocity difference. Their structure is analysed where, in general, only
one branch of the dual flows is compatible with the Oberbeck-Boussinesq
approximation, for realistic values of the Gebhart number. A linear stability
analysis of the basic stationary flows with viscous dissipation is carried out.
The stability eigenvalue problem is solved numerically, leading to the

audience, users started actively engaging in social interactions with this
technology. Such unprecedented interaction experiences may pose considerable
social and psychological risks to the users unless the technology is properly
controlled. This creates an urgent need for scalable and robust evaluation
metrics for conversational chatbots. Existing automatic evaluation metrics
usually focus on objective quality measures and disregard subjective
perceptions of social dimensions. Moreover, most of these approaches operate on
pre-produced dialogs from available benchmark corpora, which implies human
involvement for preparing the material for evaluation and, thus, impeded
scalability of the metrics. To address this limitation, we propose to make use
of the emerging large language models (LLMs) from the GPT-family and describe a
new framework allowing to conduct dialog system evaluation with prompting. With
this framework, we are able to achieve full automation of the evaluation
pipeline and reach impressive correlation with the human judgement (up to
Pearson r=0.95 on system level). The underlying concept is to collect synthetic
chat logs of evaluated bots with a LLM in the other-play setting, where LLM is
carefully conditioned to follow a specific scenario. We further explore
different prompting approaches to produce evaluation scores with the same LLM.
The best-performing prompts, containing few-show demonstrations and
instructions, show outstanding performance on the tested dataset and
demonstrate the ability to generalize to other dialog corpora.

  interfering genomes-RNA satellite","22 pages, 9 figures",,,,"math.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Almost all viruses, regardless of their genomic material, produce defective
viral genomes (DVG) as an unavoidable byproduct of their error-prone
replication. Defective interfering (DI) elements are a subgroup of DVGs that
have been shown to interfere with the replication of the wild-type (WT) virus.
Along with DIs, other genetic elements known as satellite RNAs (satRNAs), that
show no genetic relatedness with the WT virus, can co-infect cells with WT
helper viruses and take advantage of viral proteins for their own benefit.
These satRNAs have effects that range from reduced symptom severity to enhanced
virulence. The interference dynamics of DIs over WT viruses has been thoroughly
modelled at within-cell, within-host, and population levels. However, nothing
is known about the dynamics resulting from the nonlinear interactions between
WT viruses and DIs in the presence of satellites, a process that is frequently
seen in plant RNA viruses and in biomedically relevant pathosystems like
hepatitis B virus and its $\delta$ satellite. Here, we look into a
phenomenological mathematical model that describes how a WT virus replicates
and produces DIs in presence of a satRNA at the intra-host level. The WT virus
is subject to mechanisms of complementation, competition, and various levels of
interference from DIs and the satRNA. Examining the dynamics analytically and
numerically reveals three possible stable states: (i) full extinction, (ii)
satellite extinction and virus-DIs coexistence and (iii) full coexistence.
Assuming DIs replicate faster than the satRNA owed to their smaller size drives
to scenario (ii), which implies that DIs could wipe out the satRNA. In
addition, a small region of the parameter space exists wherein the system is
bistable (either scenarios (ii) or (iii) are concurrently stable).

control capabilities, H-MIMO opens up the opportunity for signal processing in
a more fundamental EM-domain, paving the way for realizing holographic imaging
level communications in supporting the extremely high spectral efficiency and
energy efficiency in future networks. In this article, we try to implement a
generalized EM-domain near-field channel modeling and study its capacity limit
of point-to-point H-MIMO systems that equips arbitrarily placed surfaces in a
line-of-sight (LoS) environment. Two effective and computational-efficient
channel models are established from their integral counterpart, where one is
with a sophisticated formula but showcases more accurate, and another is
concise with a slight precision sacrifice. Furthermore, we unveil the capacity
limit using our channel model, and derive a tight upper bound based upon an
elaborately built analytical framework. Our result reveals that the capacity
limit grows logarithmically with the product of transmit element area, receive
element area, and the combined effects of $1/{{d}_{mn}^2}$, $1/{{d}_{mn}^4}$,
and $1/{{d}_{mn}^6}$ over all transmit and receive antenna elements, where
$d_{mn}$ indicates the distance between each transmit and receive elements.
Numerical evaluations validate the effectiveness of our channel models, and
showcase the slight disparity between the upper bound and the exact capacity,
which is beneficial for predicting practical system performance.

(ii) the covariance matrix is an unknown scalar multiple of a known matrix -
and prove that in each of these settings a BH-type stepup method based on some

Analysis reveals inconsistencies in the identification of a number of
potentially Earth-directed CMEs. The catalogues reflect our ability to identify
and characterise CMEs, so any discrepancies can impact our prediction of
Earth-directed CMEs. We show that 15 CMEs, which were observed by STEREO, that

However, their study has two limitations: First, it relies on gold-annotated

they represent claim entities with the original tokens. This constitutes a
terminology mismatch which potentially limits the fact-checking performance. To

tasks remain prohibitively expensive and impractical to learn. Recently,
approaches that automatically generate reward functions from logical task
specifications have been proposed to mitigate this issue; however, they scale
poorly on long-horizon tasks (i.e., tasks where the agent needs to perform a
series of correct actions to reach the goal state, considering future
transitions while choosing an action). Employing a curriculum (a sequence of
increasingly complex tasks) further improves the learning speed of the agent by
sequencing intermediate tasks suited to the learning capacity of the agent.
However, generating curricula from the logical specification still remains an
unsolved problem. To this end, we propose AGCL, Automaton-guided Curriculum
Learning, a novel method for automatically generating curricula for the target
task in the form of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). AGCL encodes the
specification in the form of a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and then
uses the DFA along with the Object-Oriented MDP (OOMDP) representation to
generate a curriculum as a DAG, where the vertices correspond to tasks, and
edges correspond to the direction of knowledge transfer. Experiments in
gridworld and physics-based simulated robotics domains show that the curricula
produced by AGCL achieve improved time-to-threshold performance on a complex
sequential decision-making problem relative to state-of-the-art curriculum
learning (e.g, teacher-student, self-play) and automaton-guided reinforcement
learning baselines (e.g, Q-Learning for Reward Machines). Further, we
demonstrate that AGCL performs well even in the presence of noise in the task's
OOMDP description, and also when distractor objects are present that are not
modeled in the logical specification of the tasks' objectives.

three-body recombination has been the subject of extensive work during the last

  We identify the invariant geometric objects of the problem, namely a polytope
$P$ arising from the coefficients and two subspaces representing monomial
differences and dependencies. The dimension of the latter subspace (the
monomial dependency $d$) is crucial. Indeed, we rewrite the problem in terms of
$d$ (monomial) conditions on the coefficient polytope $P$ (which depend on the
parameters via $d$ monomials).
  We obtain the following classification: If $d=0$, solutions exist (for all
$c>0$) and can be parametrized explicitly (thereby generalizing monomial
parametrizations of ``toric'' solutions). If $d>0$, the treatment of the $d$
conditions on $P$ requires additional objects and methods such as
sign-characteristic functions, Descartes' rule of signs for functions, and
Wronskians.

improve previous upper bounds for the number of positive solutions to (i) $n$
trinomials involving $n+2$ monomials in $n$ variables and (ii) one trinomial

naturally by taking into account the weak dependence of the disc aspect ratio,
$h/r$, on the disc mass-flow rate, $\dot{M}_\mathrm{in}$, in the X-ray
irradiation flux calculation. This $\dot{M}_\mathrm{in}$ dependence of $h/r$
only slightly modifies the irradiation temperature profile along the hot disc
in comparison to that obtained with constant $h/r$. Nevertheless, this small
difference has a significant cumulative effect on the hot disc radius leading
to a much faster decrease in the size of the hot disc, and thereby to a sharper
decay in the X-ray outburst light curve. The same model also produces the
long-term evolution of the source consistently with its observed outburst
recurrence times and typical light curves of Aql X-1. Our results imply that
the source accretes matter from the disc in the quiescent state as well. We

without invoking external magnetism remain one of the challenges in
spintronics. The spin Hall effect (SHE) and Rashba-Edelstein effect (REE) are
well-known mechanisms to electrically generate spin accumulation in materials
with strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC), but the exact role of the strength and
type of SOC, especially in crystals with low symmetry, has yet to be explained.
In this study, we investigate REE in two different families of non-magnetic
chiral materials, elemental semiconductors (Te and Se) and semimetallic
disilicides (TaSi$_2$ and NbSi$_2$), using an approach based on density
functional theory (DFT). By analyzing spin textures across the full Brillouin
zones and comparing them with REE magnitudes calculated as a function of
chemical potential, we link specific features in the electronic structure with
the efficiency of the induced spin accumulation. Our findings show that
magnitudes of REE can be increased by: (i) the presence of purely radial
(Weyl-type) spin texture manifesting as the parallel spin-momentum locking,
(ii) high spin polarization of bands along one specific crystallographic
direction, (iii) low band velocities. By comparing materials possessing the
same crystal structures, but different strengths of SOC, we conclude that
larger SOC may indirectly contribute to the enhancement of REE. It yields
greater spin-splitting of bands along specific crystallographic directions,
which prevents canceling the contributions from the oppositely spin-polarized
bands over wider energy regions and helps maintain larger REE magnitudes. We
believe that these results will be useful for designing spintronics devices and
may aid further computational studies searching for efficient REE in materials
with different symmetries and SOC strengths.

of non-Markovian open quantum systems, most struggle with simulations for very
long memory and propagation times, e.g., due to superlinear scaling with the
number of time steps $n$. Here, we introduce a numerically exact algorithm to
calculate process tensors -- compact representations of environmental
influences -- which provides a scaling advantage over previous algorithms by
leveraging self-similarity of the tensor networks that represent Gaussian
environments. Based on a divide-and-conquer strategy, our approach requires
only $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ singular value decompositions for environments with
infinite memory. Where the memory can be truncated after $n_c$ time steps, a
scaling $\mathcal{O}(n_c\log n_c)$ is found, which is independent of $n$. This
improved scaling is enabled by identifying process tensors with repeatable
blocks. To demonstrate the power and utility of our approach we provide three
examples. (1) We calculate the fluorescence spectra of a quantum dot under both
strong driving and strong dot-phonon couplings, a task requiring simulations
over millions of time steps, which we are able to perform in minutes. (2) We
efficiently find process tensors describing superradiance of multiple emitters.
(3) We explore the limits of our algorithm by considering coherence decay with
a very strongly coupled environment. The algorithm we present here not only
significantly extends the scope of numerically exact techniques to open quantum

These algorithms utilize conditional independence tests to infer parts of the

causally-spurious links before passing the remaining causal features as inputs
to ML models (Multiple linear regression, Random Forest) that predict the
targets. We apply our framework to the statistical intensity prediction of
Western Pacific Tropical Cyclones (TC), for which it is often difficult to
accurately choose drivers and their dimensionality reduction (time lags,
vertical levels, and area-averaging). Using more stringent significance
thresholds in the conditional independence tests helps eliminate spurious
causal relationships, thus helping the ML model generalize better to unseen TC
cases. M-PC1 with a reduced number of features outperforms M-PCMCI, non-causal
ML, and other feature selection methods (lagged correlation, random), even

which can be solved exactly to obtain the distribution of mature RNA numbers

of the nascent RNA numbers. These solutions are routinely used for the analysis
of single-cell data, including the inference of transcriptional parameters.
However, these models neglect important mechanistic features of transcription
elongation, such as the stochastic movement of RNA polymerases and their steric
interactions. Here we construct a model of gene expression describing promoter
switching between inactive and active states, binding of RNA polymerases in the
active state, their stochastic movement including steric interactions along the
gene, and their unbinding leading to a mature transcript that subsequently
decays. We derive the steady-state distributions of the nascent and mature RNA
numbers in two important limiting cases: constitutive expression and slow
promoter switching. We show that RNA fluctuations are suppressed by steric
interactions between RNA polymerases, and that this suppression can even lead
to sub-Poissonian fluctuations; these effects are most pronounced for nascent
RNA and less prominent for mature RNA, since the latter is not a direct sensor
of transcription. We find a relationship between the parameters of our
microscopic mechanistic model and those of the standard models that ensures
excellent consistency in their prediction of the first and second RNA number
moments over vast regions of parameter space, encompassing slow, intermediate,
and rapid promoter switching, provided the RNA number distributions are
Poissonian or super-Poissonian. Furthermore, we identify the limitations of
inference from mature RNA data, specifically showing that it cannot

server may be able to collect a small amount of data that approximately mimics
the population distribution and has stronger computational ability to perform
the learning process. To address this, we focus on the hybrid FL framework in

training of clients and server can increase convergence speed, it has focused
on the scenario where clients fully participate and ignores the negative effect

sea ice loss, looming climate change impacts, and more. A key feature in Arctic
sea ice is the formation of melt ponds. Each year melt ponds develop on the
surface of the ice and primarily via affecting the albedo, they have an
enormous effect on the energy budget and climate of the Arctic. As melt ponds
are subgrid scale and their evolution occurs due to a number of competing,
poorly understood factors, their representation in models is parametrised.
  Sobol sensitivity analysis, a form of variance based global sensitivity
analysis is performed on an advanced melt pond parametrisation (MPP), in
Icepack, a state-of-the-art thermodynamic column sea ice model. Results show
that the model is very sensitive to changing its uncertain MPP parameter
values, and that these have varying influences over model predictions both
spatially and temporally. Such extreme sensitivity to parameters makes MPPs a
potential source of prediction error in sea-ice model, given that the (often
many) parameters in MPPs are usually poorly known.
  Machine learning (ML) techniques have shown great potential in learning and
replacing subgrid scale processes in models. Given the complexity of melt pond
physics and the need for accurate parameter values in MPPs, we propose an
alternative data-driven MPPs that would prioritise the accuracy of albedo
predictions. In particular, we constructed MPPs based either on linear
regression or on nonlinear neural networks, and investigate if they could
substitute the original physics-based MPP in Icepack.
  Our results shown that linear regression are insufficient as emulators,
whilst neural networks can learn and emulate the MPP in Icepack very reliably.
Icepack with the MPPs based on neural networks only slightly deviates from the
original Icepack and overall offers the same long term model behaviour.

considerable synergistic in biological media reactivity. In the present paper,
using a 420 mT N42 magnet, the effect of the perpendicular external static

based on the optical emission spectroscopy, utilizing the Boltzmann plot

that the rotational and electronic excitational temperature experienced 100 K

temperature estimated as 1.04 eV in the absence of SMF and increased up to 1.24

that the electron density increased in presence of the additional SMF. The
results of the present study indicated that the magnetic field could be an
assistant to the cold plasma effect, beneficial in medical applications due to
modifications in plasma temperature and electron density.

framework, we analyze the optimal strategies of defenders and attackers.

augmented with additional actions that gather information about the features,
equivalent to building a DT. By appropriately penalizing these actions, the RL
agent learns to optimally trade-off size and performance of a DT. However, to
do so, this RL agent has to solve a partially observable MDP. The main
contribution of this paper is to prove that it is sufficient to solve a fully

some quantum models to show the quantum decoherence in neurons. Assuming a
quantum superposition of dimers in microtubules we have separately presented
two types of interaction with its environment. For interaction with bosonic
environment we have shown that the decoherence time scale depends on a constant
factor which depends on the interaction coefficients and amplitude of spectral
density. For interaction with spin environment we have pointed out one case
where the coherent superposition state of dimer is strong enough to survive
against the environmental induced decoherence.

secure grid operation. We propose to extend contingency analysis (CA) that is
currently used to secure the grid against natural threats to protect against
cyberthreats. However, unlike traditional N-1 or N-2 contingencies,
cyberthreats (e.g., MadIoT) require CA to solve harder N-k (with k >> 2)
contingencies in a practical amount of time. Purely physics-based solvers,
while robust, are slow and may not solve N-k contingencies in a timely manner,
whereas the emerging data-driven alternatives to power grid analytics are fast
but not sufficiently generalizable, interpretable, or scalable. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel conditional Gaussian Random Field-based
data-driven method that is bothfast and robust. It achieves speedup by
improving starting points for the physical solvers. To improve the physical
interpretability and generalizability, the proposed method incorporates domain
knowledge by considering the graphical nature of the grid topology. To improve
scalability, the method applies physics-informed regularization that reduces
the model size and complexity. Experiments validate that simulating
MadIoT-induced N-k contingencies with our warm starter requires 5x fewer
iterations for a realistic 2000-bus system.

many different fields of science, technology and industry to investigate
material properties or for identification of concentrations of substances.
Usually the color information is used as a global parameter in a macro scale.
To quantitatively measure color information in micro scale one needs to use
dedicated microscope spectrophotometers or specialized micro-reflectance
setups. Here, the Colorimetric Microscopy (C-Microscopy) approach based on
digital optical microscopy and a free software is presented. The C-Microscopy
approach uses color calibrated image and colorimetric calculations to obtain
physically meaningful quantities i.e. dominant wavelength and excitation purity
maps at micro level scale. This allows for the discovery of the local color
details of samples surfaces. Later, to fully characterize the optical
properties, the hyperspectral reflectance data at micro scale (reflectance as a
function of wavelength for a each point) are colorimetrically recovered. The
C-Microscopy approach was successfully applied to various types of samples i.e.
two metamorphic rocks unakite and lapis lazuli, which are mixtures of different
minerals; and to the surface of gold 99.999% pellet, which exhibits different
types of surface features. The C-Microscopy approach could be used to quantify
the local optical properties changes of various materials at microscale in an
accessible way. The approach is freely available as a set of python jupyter

work well when reentry to Earth is not an issue. The typical strategy is to
have a controlled descent of the spacecraft or to have extremely limited
shielding, if any, due to the NASA requirement that all impacting parts must
impact with no greater than 15J of energy. Given the nature of this mission
neither a controlled descent nor having no shielding was not an option. This is
the issue Wichita State University nuSOL team is facing for its 3U CubeSat

  The CubeSat will be equipped with scientific equipment with the purpose of
detecting solar neutrinos, and the less background noise from Cosmic Rays the
better the study will be. Through simulations, density tests, and burn tests,
WSU was able to develop an epoxy based shield doped with either iron or
tungsten powder. The simulations were conducted by firing electrons, protons,
alpha particles, and oxygen and iron nuclei into the shield material with
energies ranging from 1MeV until consistent failure rate using Geant4. The
standards for these simulations are the base epoxy at 1.15g per cc to solid
steel at 8g per cc . Mixing tests have determined for iron, a density of 4g per
cc is achievable, which is 53 percent iron by volume. Tungsten epoxy with a
density of 7.5g per cc is more easily achieved, and results in 40 percent
tungsten by volume. These ratios are concrete in texture, pourable, and
homogeneous.

The high-grade
brain tumors are easier to recurrent even after standard treatment. Therefore,
developing a method to predict brain tumor recurrence location plays an
important role in the treatment planning and it can potentially prolong
patient's survival time. There is still little work to deal with this issue. In
this paper, we present a deep learning-based brain tumor recurrence location
prediction network. Since the dataset is usually small, we propose to use
transfer learning to improve the prediction. We first train a multi-modal brain
tumor segmentation network on the public dataset BraTS 2021. Then, the
pre-trained encoder is transferred to our private dataset for extracting the
rich semantic features. Following that, a multi-scale multi-channel feature
fusion model and a nonlinear correlation learning module are developed to learn
the effective features. The correlation between multi-channel features is
modeled by a nonlinear equation. To measure the similarity between the
distributions of original features of one modality and the estimated correlated
features of another modality, we propose to use Kullback-Leibler divergence.
Based on this divergence, a correlation loss function is designed to maximize
the similarity between the two feature distributions. Finally, two decoders are
constructed to jointly segment the present brain tumor and predict its future
tumor recurrence location. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that can segment the present tumor and at the same time predict future tumor
recurrence location, making the treatment planning more efficient and precise.
The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method
to predict the brain tumor recurrence location from the limited dataset.

versatile IoT node bridging this gap in processing and in energy by leveraging
two on-chip sub-systems: a low power, clock-less, event-driven

However, regression has its own limitations. For example, in a regression

multicollinearity issue and instability in the results. A regression model
cannot also consider the cost of hedging in the hedge ratios estimation. We
have introduced several methods that address the linear regression limitation
while achieving better performance. These models, in general, fall into two
categories: Regularization Techniques and Common Factor Analyses. In
regularization techniques, we minimize the variance of hedged portfolio profit
and loss (PnL) and the hedge ratio sizes, which helps reduce the cost of
hedging. The regularization techniques methods could also consider the cost of
hedging as a function of the cost of funding, market condition, and liquidity.
In common factor analyses, we first map variables into common factors and then
find the hedge ratios so that the hedged portfolio doesn't have any exposure to
the factors. We can use linear or nonlinear factors construction. We are
introducing a modified beta variational autoencoder that constructs common
factors nonlinearly to compute hedges. Finally, we introduce a comparison

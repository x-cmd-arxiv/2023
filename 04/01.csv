  Tables",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural-network-based single image depth prediction (SIDP) is a challenging
task where the goal is to predict the scene's per-pixel depth at test time.
Since the problem, by definition, is ill-posed, the fundamental goal is to come
up with an approach that can reliably model the scene depth from a set of
training examples. In the pursuit of perfect depth estimation, most existing
state-of-the-art learning techniques predict a single scalar depth value
per-pixel. Yet, it is well-known that the trained model has accuracy limits and
can predict imprecise depth. Therefore, an SIDP approach must be mindful of the
expected depth variations in the model's prediction at test time. Accordingly,
we introduce an approach that performs continuous modeling of per-pixel depth,
where we can predict and reason about the per-pixel depth and its distribution.
To this end, we model per-pixel scene depth using a multivariate Gaussian
distribution. Moreover, contrary to the existing uncertainty modeling methods
-- in the same spirit, where per-pixel depth is assumed to be independent, we
introduce per-pixel covariance modeling that encodes its depth dependency w.r.t
all the scene points. Unfortunately, per-pixel depth covariance modeling leads
to a computationally expensive continuous loss function, which we solve
efficiently using the learned low-rank approximation of the overall covariance
matrix. Notably, when tested on benchmark datasets such as KITTI, NYU, and
SUN-RGB-D, the SIDP model obtained by optimizing our loss function shows
state-of-the-art results. Our method's accuracy (named MG) is among the top on
the KITTI depth-prediction benchmark leaderboard.

levels of automation (SAE level 3+), the need for safety systems that are
capable to monitor system health and maintain safe operations in faulty
scenarios is increasing. A variety of faults or failures could occur, and there
exists a high variety of ways to respond to such events. Once a fault or
failure is detected, there is a need to classify its severity and decide on
appropriate and safe mitigating actions. To provide a solution to this
mitigation challenge, in this paper a functional-safety architecture is
proposed and an optimization-based mitigation algorithm is introduced. This
algorithm uses nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to bring a vehicle,
suffering from a severe fault, such as a power steering failure, to a
safe-state. The internal model of the NMPC uses the information from the fault
detection, isolation and identification to optimize the tracking performance of
the controller, showcasing the need of the proposed architecture. Given a
string of ACC vehicles, our results demonstrate a variety of tactical
decision-making approaches that a fault-affected vehicle could employ to manage
any faults. Furthermore, we show the potential for improving the safety of the
affected vehicle as well as the effect of these approaches on the duration of
the manoeuvre.

simultaneously an isolated 3D object from different sides, generating
independent coherent diffraction patterns, resulting in two distinct

obtain a 3D reconstruction using a ray tracing algorithm. This EUV stereoscopic

wide range of domains from engineering to physics. Devices that perform these
measurements therefore need to be extremely precise to obtain correct system
diagnostics and accurate predictions, consequently requiring a rigorous
calibration procedure which models their errors before being employed. While
the deterministic components of these errors do not represent a major modelling
challenge, most of the research over the past years has focused on delivering
methods that can explain and estimate the complex stochastic components of
these errors. This effort has allowed to greatly improve the precision and
uncertainty quantification of measurement devices but has this far not
accounted for a significant stochastic noise that arises for many of these
devices: vibration noise. Indeed, having filtered out physical explanations for
this noise, a residual stochastic component often carries over which can
drastically affect measurement precision. This component can originate from
different sources, including the internal mechanics of the measurement devices
as well as the movement of these devices when placed on moving objects or
vehicles. To remove this disturbance from signals, this work puts forward a
modelling framework for this specific type of noise and adapts the Generalized
Method of Wavelet Moments to estimate these models. We deliver the asymptotic
properties of this method when applied to processes that include vibration
noise and show the considerable practical advantages of this approach in
simulation and applied case studies.

changing the stationary distribution) and obtain quantitative estimates on the
mixing time. We show that an exponentially mixing drift can be rescaled to make
the mixing time of the Langevin system arbitrarily small. For numerical
purposes, it is useful to keep the size of the imposed drift small, and we show
that the smallest allowable rescaling ensures that the mixing time is $O(
d/\kappa^3)$, which is an order of magnitude smaller than $e^{O(1/\kappa)}.$
  We provide one construction of an exponentially mixing drift, although with
rate constants whose $\kappa$-dependence is unknown. Heuristics (from discrete

that higher-order interactions always hamper the appearance of rare events,

differ significantly from the training data and settings of these models. Thus,
there is a need to deepen our understanding of how AC solutions can be best

critiquing the existing practices, presents four critical lessons to be noted
by the hitchhiker when applying AC for HRI research. These lessons conclude
that: (i) The six basic emotions categories are irrelevant in situated
interactions, (ii) Affect recognition accuracy (%) improvements are
unimportant, (iii) Affect recognition does not generalise across contexts, and
(iv) Affect recognition alone is insufficient for adaptation and
personalisation. By describing the background and the context for each lesson,
and demonstrating how these lessons have been learnt, this paper aims to enable
the hitchhiker to successfully and insightfully leverage AC solutions for

issue. First, a modified adaptive RBF neural network (RBFNN) is proposed to
represent all uncertainties in kinodynamics. Then the Lyapunov function is
utilized to design its adaptive law, and a variable step-size algorithm is
employed in the weights update procedure to accelerate convergence and improve
stability. Hence, a new adaptive model prediction control-based instruction
planner (VAN-MPC) is proposed. Without modifying the bottom controllers, we
finally develop the multi-terrain trajectory tracking framework by employing
the new instruction planner VAN-MPC. The practical experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness and robustness.

documentation of risks associated with an application of language models. As
with all language, text generated by language models can be harmful, or used to
bring about harm. Automating language generation adds both an element of scale
and also more subtle or emergent undesirable tendencies to the generated text.
Prior work establishes a wide variety of language model harms to many different
actors: existing taxonomies identify categories of harms posed by language
models; benchmarks establish automated tests of these harms; and documentation
standards for models, tasks and datasets encourage transparent reporting.
However, there is no risk-centric framework for documenting the complexity of a
landscape in which some risks are shared across models and contexts, while
others are specific, and where certain conditions may be required for risks to
manifest as harms. RiskCards address this methodological gap by providing a
generic framework for assessing the use of a given language model in a given
scenario. Each RiskCard makes clear the routes for the risk to manifest harm,
their placement in harm taxonomies, and example prompt-output pairs. While
RiskCards are designed to be open-source, dynamic and participatory, we present
a ""starter set"" of RiskCards taken from a broad literature survey, each of
which details a concrete risk presentation. Language model RiskCards initiate a
community knowledge base which permits the mapping of risks and harms to a
specific model or its application scenario, ultimately contributing to a
better, safer and shared understanding of the risk landscape.

safety and preventing unexpected failure in manufacturing and diagnostic
processes. Long-term capacity trajectory predictions can fail due to cumulative
errors and noise. To address this issue, this study proposes a data-centric
method that uses early single-cycle data to predict the capacity degradation
trajectory of lithium-ion cells. The method involves predicting a few knots at
specific retention levels using a deep learning-based model and interpolating
them to reconstruct the trajectory. Two approaches are used to identify the
retention levels of two to four knots: uniformly dividing the retention up to
the end of life and finding optimal locations using Bayesian optimization. The
proposed model is validated with experimental data from 169 cells using
five-fold cross-validation. The results show that mean absolute percentage
errors in trajectory prediction are less than 1.60% for all cases of knots. By
predicting only the cycle numbers of at least two knots based on early
single-cycle charge and discharge data, the model can directly estimate the
overall capacity degradation trajectory. Further experiments suggest using
three-cycle input data to achieve robust and efficient predictions, even in the
presence of noise. The method is then applied to predict various shapes of
capacity degradation patterns using additional experimental data from 82 cells.
The study demonstrates that collecting only the cycle information of a few
knots during model training and a few early cycle data points for predictions
is sufficient for predicting capacity degradation. This can help establish
appropriate warranties or replacement cycles in battery manufacturing and
diagnosis processes.

reconfiguration of the initial state to an explosive one, and a non-disruptive
outcome in between can nevertheless still be a route to turbulence. The
literature on thermal instability (TI) reveals that even for a simple
homogeneous plasma, all these possibilities can occur, depending on whether the
condensations that form evolve in an isobaric or nonisobaric manner. Here we
derive several general identities from the evolution equation for entropy that
reveals the mechanism by which TI saturates: whenever the boundary of the
instability region (the Balbus contour) is crossed, a dynamical change is
triggered that causes the comoving time derivative of the pressure to change
sign. This temporal event implies that the gas pressure force reverses
direction, slowing the continued growth of the condensation. For isobaric
evolution, this `pressure reversal' occurs nearly simultaneously for every
fluid element in the condensation and a steady state is quickly reached. For
nonisobaric evolution, the condensation is no longer in mechanical equilibrium
and the contracting gas rebounds with greater force during the expansion phase
that accompanies gas reaching the equilibrium curve. The cloud then pulsates
because the return to mechanical equilibrium becomes wave-mediated as a result
of the pressure reversal occurring at different times for different locations
in the cloud core. We show that both the contraction rebound event and the
subsequent pulsation behavior follow analytically from an analysis of the new
identities.

surprisingly, the quantum illumination protocol has demonstrated that its

this advantage is challenging since the information is hidden in the weak

correlation-to-displacement conversion module provides a route towards an
optimal protocol for practical microwave quantum illumination. In this work, we
extend the conversion module to accommodate experimental imperfections that are
ubiquitous in microwave systems. To mitigate loss, we propose amplification of
the return signals. In the case of ideal amplification, the entire six-decibel
error-exponent advantage in target detection error can be maintained. However,
in the case of noisy amplification, this advantage is reduced to three-decibel.
We analyze the quantum advantage under different scenarios with a Kennedy
receiver in the final measurement. In the ideal case, the performance still
achieves the optimal one over a fairly large range with only on-off detection.
Empowered by photon number resolving detectors, the performance is further
improved and also analyzed in terms of receiver operating characteristic

common simulation parameters, a variable ordering by increasing variance is
closely aligned with a causal order and introduce var-sortability to quantify
the alignment. Here, we show that not only variance, but also the fraction of a
variable's variance explained by all others, as captured by the coefficient of
determination $R^2$, tends to increase along the causal order. Simple baseline
algorithms can use $R^2$-sortability to match the performance of established
methods. Since $R^2$-sortability is invariant under data rescaling, these
algorithms perform equally well on standardized or rescaled data, addressing a
key limitation of algorithms exploiting var-sortability. We characterize and
empirically assess $R^2$-sortability for different simulation parameters. We
show that all simulation parameters can affect $R^2$-sortability and must be

models to neural language models. Recently, pre-trained language models (PLMs)
have been proposed by pre-training Transformer models over large-scale corpora,
showing strong capabilities in solving various NLP tasks. Since researchers
have found that model scaling can lead to performance improvement, they further
study the scaling effect by increasing the model size to an even larger size.
Interestingly, when the parameter scale exceeds a certain level, these enlarged
language models not only achieve a significant performance improvement but also
show some special abilities that are not present in small-scale language
models. To discriminate the difference in parameter scale, the research
community has coined the term large language models (LLM) for the PLMs of

both academia and industry, and a remarkable progress is the launch of ChatGPT,
which has attracted widespread attention from society. The technical evolution
of LLMs has been making an important impact on the entire AI community, which

quantum Gibbs samplers have emerged as an alternative, but prior proposals have
been unsatisfactory due to technical obstacles related to energy-time
uncertainty. We introduce simple continuous-time quantum Gibbs samplers that
overcome these obstacles by efficiently simulating Nature-inspired quantum
Master Equations (Liouvillians) utilizing the operator Fourier transform. In
addition, we construct the first provably accurate and efficient algorithm for
preparing certain purified Gibbs states (called thermal field double states in
high-energy physics) of rapidly thermalizing systems; this algorithm also
benefits from a Szegedy-type quadratic improvement with respect to the mixing
time. Our algorithms' cost has a favorable dependence on temperature, accuracy,
and the mixing time (or spectral gap) of the relevant Liouvillians. We
contribute to the theory of thermalization by developing a general analytic
framework that handles energy uncertainty through non-asymptotic secular
approximation and approximate detailed balance, establishing our approximation
guarantees and, as a byproduct yielding the first rigorous proof of finite-time
thermalization for physically derived Liouvillians. Given the success of the
classical Metropolis algorithm and the ubiquity of thermodynamics, we
anticipate that quantum Gibbs sampling will become an indispensable tool in

We also use the spectrally-extracted AGN as a reference to accurately determine
the observed MUSE and OASIS AO PSF. We then perform Jeans Anisotropic Modelling
(JAM), with a new flexible spatially-variable anisotropy, and measure the
anisotropy profile, stellar mass-to-light variations, inner dark matter
fraction, and black hole mass. Our preferred black hole mass is $M_{\rm

density from previous studies, we find a preferred black hole mass of $M_{\rm

be well represented by a Procedural Knowledge Graph (PKG), where nodes are
discrete steps and edges connect steps that occur sequentially in the
instructional activities. This graph can then be used to generate pseudo labels

considered type of incidence functions, by virtue of semi-group theory, a
truncation technique and Banach fixed point theorem, we prove the existence and
pathwise uniqueness of mild solutions, depending continuously on the initial

useful for low-luminosity AGN since they are excluded by the criterion of large
equivalent width of the $H\alpha$ emission line when applied to optical

computer (NISQ) era, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm offers
a promising approach to efficiently estimate the stable energy state of a given
molecule. This study is focused on predicting the ground state and single
electron detachment energy of the hydride ion because of its high electron
electron correlation and numerous applications in astrophysics and quantum
chemistry. The hydride ion is the first three body quantum problem for which
the ground state energy has been calculated theoretically using the
Chandrasekhar Wavefunction, which takes high electron-electron correlation into
account. For the calculation of hydride ion, we used the VQE algorithm with two
types of quantum computational ansatz, (i) chemistry inspired ansatz based on
unitary CC (UCC) and (ii) hardware efficient based ansatz (HEA). To check the
versatility of the algorithm, we analyzed two proton transfer reactions
involving the hydride ion and finds the energy to be exothermic with a much
improved result compared to previous studies. Overall, the VQE algorithm with a
quantum computational approach is found to be reliable in calculating stable
state energy, single electron detachment energy, and reaction energy for proton

percentage error.

some primes $p$ and $q$. GGC is checked up to $10^{12}d$ for all (up to

m_2)}$ and $m_1/d, m_2/d \leq 40$. The largest counterexamples found that
cannot be obtained in this form are presented. Their relatively small sizes
support the plausibility of GGC. Lemoine's conjecture is verified up to a new
record of $10^{13}$. Four naturally arising verifying algorithms are described
and their running times compared for every $m_1\leq m_2\leq 40$ relatively
prime. These seek to find either the $p$- or the $q$-minimal $(m_1,
m_2)$-partitions of all numbers tested, by either descending or ascending
search for the prime to be maximised or minimised, respectively, in the
partitions. For all $m_1, m_2$ descending searches were faster than ascending
ones. A heuristic explanation is provided. The relative speed of ascending
[descending] searches for the $p$- and for the $q$-minimal partitions,
respectively, varied by $m_1, m_2$. Using the average of $p^*_{m_1, m_2}(n)$ -
the minimal $p$ in all $(m_1, m_2)$-partitions of $n$ - up to a sufficiently
large threshold, two functions of $m_1, m_2$ are introduced, which may help
predict these rankings. Our predictions correspond well with actual rankings.
These could be further improved by developing approximations to $p^*_{m_1,
m_2}(n)$. Numerical data are presented, including average and maximum values of
$p^*_{m_1, m_2}(n)$ up to $10^9$. An extension of GGC is proposed, generalising
the Twin prime conjecture and the assertion that there are infinitely many

show that this cancellation is avoided in chiral semimetals, in which Weyl
nodes of opposite chirality occur at different energies due to broken mirror
symmetry. We find that the spin accumulation is maximized when the Fermi energy
coincides with one of the nodes in a pair and reaches the same value as for an
isolated node in this case. Moreover, we demonstrate the existence of a
distinct magnetoresistance mechanism, closely related to this current-induced
spin accumulation.

Generalized Cowling Nomenclature (GCN), and a Classification Based on Modal
Properties (CBMP). Using PNS models from $3$D simulations of core-collapse
supernovae, we find that in the early stages of the PNS evolution, typically
before $0.4$ seconds after the bounce, the Cowling classification is
inconsistent, but the GCN and the CBMP provide complementary information that
helps to understand the evolution of the modes. In the GCN, we note several
avoided crossings as the mode frequencies evolve at early times, while the CBMP
tracks the modes across the avoided crossings. We verify that the strongest
emission of GWs by the PNS corresponds to the $f$-mode in the GCN, indicating
that the mode trapping region alternates between the core and the envelope at
each avoided crossing. At later times, approximately $0.4$ seconds after the
bounce, the three classification methods present a similar description of the

instabilities. However, this scenario has recently been questioned by the
observational evidence of a few galaxies at z~4-5 with a gas velocity
dispersion similar to what is observed in the local population. Our goal is to
determine whether galaxies in the first Gyrs of the Universe have already
formed a dynamically cold rotating disk similar to the local counterparts. We
studied the gas kinematic of 22 main-sequence star-forming galaxies at z > 5
and determined their dynamical state by estimating the ratio of the rotational
velocity and of the gas velocity dispersion. We mined the ALMA archive and
exploited the [CII] and [OIII] observations to perform a kinematic analysis of
the cold and warm gas of z>5 main-sequence galaxies. The gas kinematics of the
high-z galaxies is consistent within the errors with rotating but turbulent
disks. We infer a velocity dispersion that is systematically higher by 4 times
than the local galaxy population and the z~5 dust-obscured galaxies reported in
the literature. The difference between our results and those reported at
similar redshift can be ascribed to the systematic difference in the galaxy
properties in the two samples: the disks of massive dusty galaxies are
dynamically colder than the disks of dust-poor galaxies. The comparison with
the theoretical predictions suggests that the main driver of the velocity
dispersion in high-z galaxies is the gravitational energy that is released by
the transport of mass within the disk. Finally, we stress that future deeper
ALMA high-angular resolution observations are crucial to constrain the
kinematic properties of high-z galaxies and to distinguish rotating disks from
kpc-scale mergers.

paper thus develops a robust method for damage identification that considers
the missing data occasions, based on long-short term memory (LSTM) model and
dropout mechanism in the autoencoder (AE) framework. Inputs channels are
randomly dropped to simulate the missing data in training, and reconstruction
errors are used as the loss function and the damage indicator. Quasi-static

finding analytic solutions for the chemical enrichment models of galactic
systems, including the Milky Way. Some of these solutions, however, cannot
account for the enrichment produced by Type Ia SNe due to the presence of the
delay time distributions (DTDs) in the models.
  Aims: We present a new analytic solution for the chemical evolution model of
the Galaxy. This solution can be used with different prescriptions of the DTD,
including the single and double degenerate scenarios, and allows the inclusion
of an arbitrary number of pristine gas infalls.
  Methods: We integrate the chemical evolution model by extending the
instantaneous recycling approximation with the contribution of Type Ia SNe. For
those DTDs that lead to non-analytic integrals, we describe them as a
superposition of Gaussian, exponential and 1/t functions using a restricted
least-squares fitting method.
  Results: We obtain the exact solution for a chemical model with Type Ia SNe
widely used in previous works. This solution can reproduce the expected
chemical evolution of the alpha and iron-peak elements in less computing time
than numerical integration methods. We compare the pattern in the [Si/Fe] vs.
[Fe/H] plane observed by APOGEE DR17 with that predicted by the model. We find
the low alpha sequence can be explained by a delayed gas infall. We exploit the
applicability of our solution by modelling the chemical evolution of a
simulated Milky Way-like galaxy from its star formation history. The
implementation of our solution is released as a python package.
  Conclusions: Our solution constitutes a promising tool for the Galactic
Archaeology and is able to model the observed trends in alpha element

binaries display a cutoff period, $P_{\rm cut}$, such that almost all binaries
with periods shorter than $P_{\rm cut}$ have circular orbits. This feature is
probably due to long-term circularization processes induced by tidal
interaction between the two stars of each binary. It seemed as if coeval
main-sequence (MS) samples of open clusters display $P_{\rm cut}$ that depends
on the sample age. Using the unprecedentedly large sample of MS spectroscopic
orbits recently released by $\textit{Gaia}$ we have found that the $P_{\rm
cut}$ does not depend on the stellar age but, instead, varies with stellar
temperature, decreasing linearly from $6.5$ day at $T_{\rm eff}\sim 5700$ K to
$\sim 2.5$ day at $6800$ K. $P_{\rm cut}$ was derived by a new algorithm that
relied on clear upper envelopes displayed in the period-eccentricity diagrams.
Our $P_{\rm cut}$ determines both the border between the circular and eccentric
binaries and the location of the upper envelope. The results are inconsistent
with the theory which assumes circularization occurs during the stellar MS
phase, a theory that was adopted by many studies. The circularization has
probably taken place at the pre-main-sequence phase, as suggested already in
1989 by Zahn and Bouchet, and later by Khaluillin and Khaluillina in 2011. Our
results suggest that the weak dependence of $P_{\rm cut}$ on the cluster age is
not significant, and/or might be due to the different temperatures of the
samples. If indeed true, this has far-reaching implications for the theory of
binary and exoplanet circularization, synchronization, and alignment.

tolerating high false positives. In this paper, we present a novel approach to
address the challenge of minimizing false positives for systems that need to
operate at a high true positive rate. We propose a ranking-based regularization
(RankReg) approach that is easy to implement, and show empirically that it not
only effectively reduces false positives, but also complements conventional
imbalanced learning losses. With this novel technique in hand, we conduct a
series of experiments on three broadly explored datasets (CIFAR-10&100 and
Melanoma) and show that our approach lifts the previous state-of-the-art
performance by notable margins.

  cloud registration","28 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we present a residual neural network-based method for point
set registration. Given a target and a reference point cloud, the goal is to
learn a minimal transformation that aligns the target to the reference under
the constraint that the topological structure of the target point cloud is
preserved. Similar to coherent point drift (CPD), the registration (alignment)
problem is viewed as the movement of data points sampled from a target
distribution along a regularized displacement vector field. While the coherence
constraint in CPD is stated in terms of local motion coherence, the proposed
regularization term relies on a global smoothness constraint as a proxy for
preserving local topology. This makes CPD less flexible when the deformation is
locally rigid but globally non-rigid as in the case of multiple objects and
articulate pose registration. To mitigate these issues, a Jacobian-based cost
function along with geometric-aware statistical distances is proposed. The
latter allows for measuring misalignment between the target and the reference.
The justification for the kNN-graph preservation of target data, when the
Jacobian cost is used, is also provided. Further, a stochastic approximation
for high dimensional registration is introduced to make a high-dimensional
alignment feasible. The proposed method is tested on high-dimensional Flow
Cytometry to align two data distributions whilst preserving the kNN-graph of
the data. The implementation of the proposed approach is available at

sketching dimension is near-linear and improves previous work which either
required $\Omega(\log d)$-approximation with this sketching dimension, or
required a larger $\operatorname{poly}(d)$ number of rows. Similarly, for
logistic regression previous work had worse $\operatorname{poly}(\mu d)$

thermal modification at 167C slightly improves the flexural modulus and

more pronounced brittleness of the thermally modified samples. In fact, the
total mode I fracture energy of modified Single Edge Notch Bending (SENB)
samples was about 47% lower for radial-longitudinal systems and 60% lower for
tangential-longitudinal systems. Similarly, the average Janka hardness in the
tangential, radial, and transverse planes was 8.5%, 3.9%, and 9.4% lower in the

thermal modification can have a significant effect on the fracturing behavior
of western hemlock and its energy dissipation capabilities. For design, this

de-integrating past views and re-integrating them with updated poses, but it
remains largely untreated in the RGB-only setting. We formalize this problem to
define the new task of online reconstruction from dynamically-posed images. To
support further research, we introduce a dataset called LivePose containing the
dynamic poses from a SLAM system running on ScanNet. We select three recent

applications in home surveillance, remote healthcare, road safety, and home

activity classification of a single human subject at a given time. Conversely,
a more realistic scenario is to achieve simultaneous, multi-subject activity
classification. The first key challenge in that context is that the number of
classes grows exponentially with the number of subjects and activities.
Moreover, it is known that Wi-Fi sensing systems struggle to adapt to new
environments and subjects. To address both issues, we propose SiMWiSense, the
first framework for simultaneous multi-subject activity classification based on
Wi-Fi that generalizes to multiple environments and subjects. We address the
scalability issue by using the Channel State Information (CSI) computed from
the device positioned closest to the subject. We experimentally prove this
intuition by confirming that the best accuracy is experienced when the CSI
computed by the transceiver positioned closest to the subject is used for
classification. To address the generalization issue, we develop a brand-new
few-shot learning algorithm named Feature Reusable Embedding Learning (FREL).
Through an extensive data collection campaign in 3 different environments and 3
subjects performing 20 different activities simultaneously, we demonstrate that
SiMWiSense achieves classification accuracy of up to 97%, while FREL improves
the accuracy by 85% in comparison to a traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) and up to 20% when compared to the state-of-the-art few-shot embedding

coarse-grained information provided in some datasets, which can provide
high-level semantic information about the image sequences but is often
neglected in previous studies. More specifically, we introduce a two-stage
Contrastive Learning with Text-Embeded framework for Facial behavior
understanding (CLEF). The first stage is a weakly-supervised contrastive
learning method that learns representations from positive-negative pairs
constructed using coarse-grained activity information. The second stage aims to
train the recognition of facial expressions or facial action units by
maximizing the similarity between image and the corresponding text label names.
The proposed CLEF achieves state-of-the-art performance on three in-the-lab

of an evaluation metric to discriminate between models of similar quality. This
capacity depends on two attributes: 1. The metric's response to improvements in
model quality (its signal), and 2. The metric's sampling variability (its
noise). The paper defines resolving power as a metric's sampling uncertainty
scaled by its signal. Resolving power's primary application is to compare the
discriminating capacity of threshold-free evaluation metrics, such as the area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under
the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). A simulation study compares the AUROC and
the AUPRC in a variety of contexts. The analysis suggests that the AUROC
generally has greater resolving power, but that the AUPRC is superior in some
conditions, such as those where high-quality models are applied to low
prevalence outcomes. The paper concludes by proposing an empirical method to
estimate resolving power that can be applied to any dataset and any initial

well-studied in the literature, but it is unclear how similar they are to the
possibilities from many-field inflation. In this work, we study stochastic

find an analytic expression for the enhancement in the power spectrum as a

habitability, there has not yet been a comprehensive observational study of how
giant exoplanets correlate with the architectural properties of close-in,
sub-Neptune sized exoplanets. This is largely because transit surveys are
particularly insensitive to planets at orbital separations > 1 AU, and so their
census of Jupiter-like planets is incomplete, inhibiting our study of the
relationship between Jupiter-like planets and the small planets that do
transit. To establish the relationship between small and giant planets, we
conducted the Kepler Giant Planet Survey (KGPS). Using W. M. Keck Observatory
HIRES, we spent over a decade collecting 2858 RVs (2181 of which are presented
here for the first time) of 63 sun-like stars that host 157 transiting planets.
We had no prior knowledge of which systems would contain giant planets beyond 1
AU, making this survey unbiased in detected Jovians. In this paper, we announce
RV-detected companions to 20 stars from our sample. These include 13 Jovians
(0.3 MJ < M sin i < 13 MJ, 1 < a < 10 AU), 7 non-transiting sub-Saturns, and 3
stellar-mass companions. We also present updated masses and densities of 84
transiting planets. The KGPS project leverages the longest-running and most
data-rich collection of RVs of the NASA Kepler systems yet, and will provide a
basis for addressing whether giant planets help or hinder the growth of
sub-Neptune sized and terrestrial planets. Future KGPS papers will examine the
relationship between small, transiting planets and their companions.

Yet, many chemistry codes that model more complex processes like photochemistry

we compare thermochemical equilibrium approximation methods based on their

interpreted as a different cluster. After defining a prior for the component
parameters and weights, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are commonly
used to produce samples from the posterior distribution of the component
labels. The data are then clustered by minimizing the expectation of a
clustering loss function that favours similarity to the component labels.
Unfortunately, although these approaches are routinely implemented, clustering
results are highly sensitive to kernel misspecification. For example, if
Gaussian kernels are used but the true density of data within a cluster is even
slightly non-Gaussian, then clusters will be broken into multiple Gaussian
components. To address this problem, we develop Fusing of Localized Densities
(FOLD), a novel clustering method that melds components together using the
posterior of the kernels. FOLD has a fully Bayesian decision theoretic
justification, naturally leads to uncertainty quantification, can be easily
implemented as an add-on to MCMC algorithms for mixtures, and favours a small
number of distinct clusters. We provide theoretical support for FOLD including
clustering optimality under kernel misspecification. In simulated experiments
and real data, FOLD outperforms competitors by minimizing the number of
clusters while inferring meaningful group structure.

without moving parts by interacting with ionized and neutral molecules in an
electric field. The coupling between electrohydrodynamic (EHD), turbulence,
inertial and viscous effects in the flow boundary layer remains poorly
understood and requires investigation. We present an experimental investigation
of momentum injection by DBD actuators into the free stream flow with Re =
35,000 and 75,000 in co-flow and counter-flow scenarios over a range of VAC =
12 kV - 19.5 kV peak-to-peak at a frequency of 2 kHz. In the co-flow
configuration, the DBD actuator injects momentum into the boundary layer. In
co-flow, the momentum injection results in the thinning boundary layer, while
in the counter-flow configuration, flow separation can occur. For the tested
condition, a separation bubble is observed at Re = 35,000. The momentum
displacement in the counter-flow configuration is six times greater than the
EHD jet momentum in a quiescent environment. Both co-flow and counter-flow
momentum injections show diminishing effects with increasing external
velocities. This work highlights that the resulting flow pattern is not a
simple superposition of the EHD jet and the free stream but is determined by
the coupling of inertial, viscous, and Coulombic effects in the EHD-driven wall
jet and the external flow. The velocity profiles and momentum measurements
presented here can be used to validate numerical models and inform the design
of DBD actuators for active flow control.

proper motions that are similar to those of the binaries. While some of the

of stars within the search area, there is still a tendency for W Ser stars to
be accompanied by companions with separations on parsec or larger scales. At
least three candidate companions are identified within the search area for each
system, although in the majority of cases the numbers are much higher. Evidence
is presented that SX Cas is near the center of a diffuse cluster.
Color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the groupings associated with the binaries

  In the first chapter, we give a complete description of Witt and

invariants behaving like divided powers, whose construction relies crucially on
lambda operations in the Grothendieck-Witt ring. We also study the behaviour of
these invariants with respect to various operations such as products or
similitudes.
  The second chapter is dedicated to the construction of a ""mixed"" Witt ring
associated to an algebra with involution : the fundamental idea is to define
the product of two $\epsilon$-hermitian forms using a Morita equivalence given
by the involution trace form of the algebra. We also define lambda operations
on the mixed Grothendieck-Witt ring, as well as a fundamental filtration
imitating the split case. A particular attention is given to explicit
calculations in the case of algebras of index 2.

1 in the framework of hermitian forms, and thus construct cohomological

challenges in the field of topological superconductivity has been the scarcity
of potential materials, in contrast to the many exciting, theoretical
predictions of properties that could be unraveled by such a discovery.
Currently, it should be far to say that a material that convincingly displays
intrinsic topological superconductivity, and Majorana zero modes, has so far
not been discovered. This perspective aims at summarizing the results of the
most actively discussed potential topological superconductors for chemists.
But, I will also compile the essential physical and chemical design principles
of these materials from a chemists' perspective in order to motivate synthetic
chemists to join the quest for the discovery of the first intrinsic topological
superconductor.

measurement units referred to as $\mu$PMU which report high-resolution phasor
measurements comprising various event signatures which provide situational
awareness and enable a level of visibility into the distribution system. These
events are infrequent, unschedule, and uncertain; it is a challenge to
scrutinize, detect and predict the occurrence of such events. For electrical
distribution systems, it is challenging to explicitly identify evolution
functions that describe the complex, non-linear, and non-stationary signature
patterns of events. In this paper, we seek to address this problem by
developing a physics dynamics-based approach to detect anomalies in the
$\mu$PMU streaming data and simultaneously predict the events using governing
equations. We propose a data-driven approach based on the Hankel alternative
view of the Koopman (HAVOK) operator, called DynamoPMU, to analyze the
underlying dynamics of the distribution system by representing them in a linear
intrinsic space. The key technical idea is that the proposed method separates
out the linear dynamical behaviour pattern and intermittent forcing (anomalous
events) in sequential data which turns out to be very useful for anomaly
detection and simultaneous data prediction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
proposed framework through analysis of real $\mu$PMU data taken from the LBNL
distribution grid. DynamoPMU is suitable for real-time event detection as well
as prediction in an unsupervised way and adapts to varying statistics.

Dicke superradiance, a form of many-body decay that results in a rapid release
of energy as a photon burst. While originally studied in point-like ensembles,
this phenomenon persists in extended ordered systems if the inter-particle
distance is below a certain bound. Here, we investigate Dicke superradiance in
a realistic experimental setting using ordered arrays of alkaline earth(-like)
atoms, such as strontium and ytterbium. Such atoms offer exciting new
opportunities for light-matter interaction as their internal structure offers
the possibility of trapping at short interatomic distances compared to their
strong long-wavelength transitions, providing the potential for strong
collectively modified interactions. Despite their intricate electronic
structure, we show that two-dimensional arrays of these atomic species should
exhibit many-body superradiance for achievable lattice constants. Moreover,
superradiance effectively ''closes'' transitions, such that multilevel atoms
become more two-level like. This occurs because the avalanche-like decay
funnels the emission of most photons into the dominant transition, overcoming
the single-atom decay ratios dictated by their fine structure and Zeeman
branching. Our work represents an important step in harnessing alkaline-earth
atoms as quantum optical sources and as dissipative generators of entanglement.

shown to yield convergent approximations in two dimensions, whereas the other
two are stabilized formulations that can be motivated by a variational
multiscale approach. For the latter, a mixed formulation equivalent to the
original problem is used, in which the operator has a saddle point structure.
The Lagrange multiplier introduced to enforce the divergence constraint
vanishes in an appropriate functional setting. The first stabilized method we

divergence constraint. The second formulation is based on orthogonal
projections, which can be recast as a residual based stabilization technique.
We rely on the classical spectral theory to analyze the approximating methods

the associated source problems. We investigate the numerical performance of the
proposed formulations and provide some convergence results validating the
theoretical ones for several benchmark tests, including ones with smooth and

instrumental component of effective governance, accountability, and ethical
behavior in any organization or system. However, a natural question follows:
\emph{what is the cost or benefit of being transparent}, as one may suspect
that transparency imposes additional constraints on the information structure,
decreasing the maneuverability of the information provider. This work proposes
and quantitatively investigates the \emph{price of transparency} (PoT) in
strategic information disclosure by comparing the perfect Bayesian equilibrium
payoffs under two representative information structures: overt persuasion and
covert signaling models. PoT is defined as the ratio between the payoff
outcomes in covert and overt interactions. As the main contribution, this work
develops a bilevel-bilinear programming approach, called $Z$-programming, to
solve for non-degenerate perfect Bayesian equilibria of dynamic incomplete
information games with finite states and actions. Using $Z$-programming, we
show that it is always in the information provider's interest to choose the
transparent information structure, as $0\leq \textrm{PoT}\leq 1$. The upper
bound is attainable for any strictly Bayesian-posterior competitive games, of
which zero-sum games are a particular case. For continuous games, the PoT,
still upper-bounded by $1$, can be arbitrarily close to $0$, indicating the
tightness of the lower bound. This tight lower bound suggests that the lack of
transparency can result in significant loss for the provider. We corroborate
our findings using quadratic games and numerical examples.

band are due to the photoelectric absorption in the accretion flow. However,
the complex absorbers may be responsible to produce low amplitude spin
modulations via Compton scattering in the hard ( > 10 keV) energy band and
indicate that the height of the X-ray emitting region may be negligible. The

effortlessly handle the long-tailed recognition challenge, since they can learn

making the learned tail features more discriminative. This phenomenon motivated
us to propose SuperDisco, an algorithm that discovers super-class

construct the super-class graph to guide the representation learning to deal
with long-tailed distributions. Through message passing on the super-class
graph, image representations are rectified and refined by attending to the most
relevant entities based on the semantic similarity among their super-classes.
Moreover, we propose to meta-learn the super-class graph under the supervision
of a prototype graph constructed from a small amount of imbalanced data. By
doing so, we obtain a more robust super-class graph that further improves the
long-tailed recognition performance. The consistent state-of-the-art

similar burst observed with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer in 2005 June. These
bursts occurred soon after outburst onset, $2.9$ and $1.1$ days, after the
first indications of fresh accretion. We measure peak burst bolometric fluxes
of $6.98 \pm 0.50 \times 10^{-9}$ and $1.54 \pm 0.10 \times 10^{-8}$ erg
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively, which are factors of $\approx 30$ and $15$
less than the peak flux of the brightest, helium-powered bursts observed from
this source. From spectral modeling we estimate accretion rates and accreted
columns at the time of each burst. For the 2019 burst we estimate an accretion
rate of $\dot M \approx 1.4-1.6 \times 10^{-10}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and a
column in the range $3.9-5.1 \times 10^7$ g cm$^{-2}$. For the 2005 event the
accretion rate was similar, but the accreted column was half of that estimated
for the 2019 burst. The low accretion rates, modest columns, and evidence for a
cool neutron star in quiescence, suggest these bursts are triggered by
thermally unstable CNO cycle hydrogen-burning. The post-burst flux level in the
2019 event appears offset from the pre-burst level by an amount consistent with
quasi-stable hydrogen-burning due to the temperature-insensitive, hot-CNO
cycle, further suggesting hydrogen-burning as the primary fuel source. This
provides strong observational evidence for hydrogen-triggered bursts. We
discuss our results in the context of previous theoretical modeling.

of circuits of biological neurons and help engineer neuro-inspired solutions
across fields. Most dynamical systems' models of spiking neural networks
typically exhibit one of two major types of interactions: First, the response
of a neuron's state variable to incoming pulse signals (spikes) may be additive
and independent of its current state. Second, the response may depend on the
current neuron's state and multiply a function of the state variable. Here we
reveal that spiking neural network models with additive coupling are equivalent
to models with multiplicative coupling for simultaneously modified intrinsic
neuron time evolution. As a consequence, the same collective dynamics can be
attained by state-dependent multiplicative and constant (state-independent)
additive coupling. Such a mapping enables the transfer of theoretical insights
between spiking neural network models with different types of interaction
mechanisms as well as simpler and more effective engineering applications.

environments, classical approaches are inefficient in high-dimensional
environments in terms of planning time and optimality. Collision checking poses
another challenge in obtaining a real-time solution for path planning in
complex environments. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end
learning-based framework viz., Path Planning and Collision checking Network
(PPCNet). The PPCNet generates the path by computing waypoints sequentially
using two networks: the first network generates a waypoint, and the second one
determines whether the waypoint is on a collision-free segment of the path. The
end-to-end training process is based on imitation learning that uses data
aggregation from the experience of an expert planner to train the two networks,
simultaneously. We utilize two approaches for training a network that
efficiently approximates the exact geometrical collision checking function.
Finally, the PPCNet is evaluated in two different simulation environments and a
practical implementation on a robotic arm for a bin-picking application.
Compared to the state-of-the-art path planning methods, our results show
significant improvement in performance by greatly reducing the planning time

users to explore the complexity vs fidelity trade-off by incrementally
generating more stumps, creating attribute-based explanations with weighted

dementia, affecting 6.2 million people aged 65 or older according to CDC data.
It is commonly agreed that discovering an effective AD diagnosis biomarker
could have enormous public health benefits, potentially preventing or delaying
up to 40% of dementia cases. Tau neurofibrillary tangles are the primary driver
of downstream neurodegeneration and subsequent cognitive impairment in AD,
resulting in structural deformations such as hippocampal atrophy that can be
observed in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Objective: To build a
surface-based model to 1) detect differences between APOE subgroups in patterns
of tau deposition and hippocampal atrophy, and 2) use the extracted
surface-based features to predict cognitive decline. Methods: Using data
obtained from different institutions, we develop a surface-based federated Chow
test model to study the synergistic effects of APOE, a previously reported
significant risk factor of AD, and tau on hippocampal surface morphometry.
Results: We illustrate that the APOE-specific morphometry features correlate
with AD progression and better predict future AD conversion than other MRI
biomarkers. For example, a strong association between atrophy and abnormal tau
was identified in hippocampal subregion cornu ammonis 1 (CA1 subfield) and
subiculum in e4 homozygote cohort. Conclusion: Our model allows for identifying
MRI biomarkers for AD and cognitive decline prediction and may uncover a corner
of the neural mechanism of the influence of APOE and tau deposition on
hippocampal morphology.

speaking, a Polish group $G$ has stronger classification strength than $H$ if
every orbit equivalence relation induced by a continuous action of $H$ on a
Polish space can be ""emulated"" by such an action of $G$ in the sense of Borel

  Among the non-Archimedean Polish groups, the groups with the highest

weakening of the existence of an absolute set of generating indiscernibles, and
not having ordinal rank for a particular coanalytic rank function, are all
equivalent to a non-Archimedean Polish group involving $S_\infty$. Furthermore,

equivalence relation in the theory of Borel reducibility, can only be

individual sources is too time-consuming, while hardness ratios often lack
accuracy, and can be difficult to use effectively. These methods fail to use
the power of X-ray CCD detectors to identify X-ray emission lines and
distinguish line-dominated spectra (from chromospherically active stars,
supernova remnants, etc.) from continuum-dominated ones (e.g., compact objects
or active galactic nuclei [AGN]). In this paper, we probe the use of artificial
neural networks (ANN) in differentiating Chandra spectra of young stars in the
Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP) survey from AGN in the Chandra Deep
Field South (CDFS) survey. We use these surveys to generate 100,000 artificial
spectra of stars and AGN and train our ANN models to separate the two kinds of
spectra. We find that our methods reach an accuracy of approx. 92% in
classifying simulated spectra of moderate-brightness objects in typical
exposures, but their performance slightly decreases on the observed COUP and
CDFS spectra (approx. 91%), due in large part to the relatively high background
of these long-exposure datasets. We also investigate the performance of our
methods with changing properties of the spectra such as the net source counts,
the relative contribution of background, the absorption column of the sources,

large X-ray surveys.

extensively studied due to their proximity to the Sun. The Gaia data brings the
opportunity to investigate these clusters, since it contains valuable
astrometric and photometric information which can be used to update their
kinematic and stellar properties. Aims. Our goal is to carry out a star
membership study in these nearby open clusters employing an astrometric model
with proper motions and an unsupervised clustering machine learning algorithm
using positions, proper motions and parallaxes. The star members are selected
from the cross-matching between both methods. Methods. We use the Gaia DR3
catalogue to determine star members using two approaches: a classical Bayesian
model and the unsupervised machine learning algorithm DBSCAN. For star members
we build the radial density profiles, the spatial distributions and compute the
King parameters. The ages and metallicities were estimated using the BASE-9
Bayesian software. Results. We identified 958, 744 and 488 star members for the
Pleiades, Praesepe and Blanco 1 respectively. We corrected the distances and
built the spatial distributions, finding that Praesepe and Blanco 1 have
elongated shape structures. The distances, ages and metallicities obtained were
consistent with the reported in the literature. Conclusions. We obtained
catalogues of star members, updated kinematic and stellar parameters for these
open clusters. We found that the proper motions model can find a similar number
of members as the unsupervised clustering algorithm does when the cluster
population form an overdensity in the vector point diagram. It allows to select
an adequate size of the proper motions region to run these methods. Our
analysis found stars that are being directed towards the outskirts of the

we systematically examine the phonon drag effect, namely the momentum exchange
between nonequilibrium phonons and electrons, and its impact on charge mobility
and Seebeck coefficient in GaN and AlN by solving the fully coupled electron
and phonon Boltzmann transport equations with ab initio scattering parameters.
We find that, even at room temperature, the phonon drag effect can
significantly enhance mobility and Seebeck coefficient in GaN and AlN,
especially at higher carrier concentrations. Furthermore, we show that the
phonon drag contribution to mobility and Seebeck coefficient scale differently
with the carrier concentration and we highlight a surprisingly important

attribute both findings to the distinct mechanisms the phonon drag affects
mobility and Seebeck coefficient. Our study advances the understanding of the
strong phonon drag effect on carrier transport in wide bandgap GaN and AlN and

first analyze the theoretical performance of discrete-aperture XL-MIMO using an
electromagnetic (EM) channel model based on the near-field spherical

polarization mismatch on the received power. We also review the amplitude-aware
Fraunhofer distance based on the considered EM channel model. Our analytical
results indicate that a limited part of the XL-array receives the majority of

the acquired VR information to design a low-complexity symbol detection scheme.
Furthermore, we propose a graph theory-based user partition algorithm, relying
on the VR overlap ratio between different users. Partial zero-forcing (PZF) is
utilized to eliminate only the interference from users allocated to the same

Numerical results confirm the correctness of the analytical results and the

can be stitched together in a zero-shot manner without further fine-tuning.
While previous research only addresses full-context speech models, we explore
the problem in a streaming setting as well. Our framework builds on top of
existing encoded representations, converting them to modular features, dubbed
as Lego-Features, without modifying the pre-trained model. The features remain
interchangeable when the model is retrained with distinct initializations.
Though sparse, we show that the Lego-Features are powerful when tested with
RNN-T or LAS decoders, maintaining high-quality downstream performance. They
are also rich enough to represent the first-pass prediction during two-pass
deliberation. In this scenario, they outperform the N-best hypotheses, since
they do not need to be supplemented with acoustic features to deliver the best

along axonal connections, especially through the myelin sheath as a waveguide,
due to its high refractive index. There is already a good deal of theoretical
and experimental evidence for light guidance in the myelin sheath; however, the
question of how the polarization of light is transmitted remains largely
unexplored. It is presently unclear whether polarization-encoded information
could be preserved within the myelin sheath. We simulate guided mode
propagation through a myelinated axon structure with multiple Ranvier nodes.
This allows both to observe polarization change and to test the assumption of
exponentiated transmission loss through multiple Ranvier nodes for guided light
in myelin sheath waveguides. We find that the polarization can be well
preserved through multiple nodes and that transmission losses through multiple
nodes are approximately multiplicative. These results provide an important

biophotons, strengthening the possibility of both classical and quantum

explicitly quantify the desired intensity of a visual attribute. A limitation
of this method is that many attributes, like how ""angry"" a human face looks,
are difficult for a user to precisely quantify. However, a user would be able
to reliably say which of two faces seems ""angrier"". Following this premise, we
develop the $\textit{PrefGen}$ system, which allows users to control the
relative attributes of generated images by presenting them with simple paired
comparison queries of the form ""do you prefer image $a$ or image $b$?"" Using
information from a sequence of query responses, we can estimate user
preferences over a set of image attributes and perform preference-guided image
editing and generation. Furthermore, to make preference localization feasible

in-context learning. Given a few demonstrations of a new subject, SuTI can
instantly generate novel renditions of the subject in different scenes, without
any subject-specific optimization. SuTI is powered by apprenticeship learning,
where a single apprentice model is learned from data generated by a massive
number of subject-specific expert models. Specifically, we mine millions of
image clusters from the Internet, each centered around a specific visual
subject. We adopt these clusters to train a massive number of expert models,

to 3-D projective geometry. It structures information integration and action
planning within an internal representation space. The way different first
person perspectives of an agent relate to each other, through transformations
of a world model, defines a specific perception scheme for the agent. In
mathematics, this collection of transformations is called a `group' and it
characterizes a geometric space by acting on it. We propose that imbuing world
models with a `geometric' structure, given by a group, is one way to capture
different perception schemes of agents. We explore how changing the geometric
structure of a world model impacts the behavior of an agent.
  In particular, we focus on how such geometrical operations transform the
formal expression of epistemic value in active inference as driving an agent's
curiosity about its environment, and impact exploration behaviors accordingly.
We used group action as a special class of policies for perspective-dependent
control. We compared the Euclidean versus projective groups. We formally
demonstrate that the groups induce distinct behaviors. The projective group
induces nonlinear contraction and dilatation that transform entropy and
epistemic value as a function of the choice of frame, which fosters exploration
behaviors. This contribution opens research avenues in which a geometry

Recently, there has been a surge in applying transportation-based distances and

Indeed, comparing intensities at fixed locations often does not reveal the data

translation (respectively dilation) vectors equipped with a Euclidean distance.
Furthermore, we prove that no-collision transportation maps, as well as OT and

numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings and show that
no-collision distances achieve similar or better performance on several

properties that its gravity and the centrifugal force largely balance, creating
a relaxation environment where low-energy events such as mass shedding may
trigger subsequent long complex motion of an asteroid's regolith grains.
Exploring such an evolution process may provide key clues for understanding the
early formation of multi-asteroid systems. This paper investigates the complex
evolution process of loose particles becoming triggered by shedding events and
the dependency of their dynamical propagation on the contact mechanical
properties of the asteroid surface. We present a numerical model for tracking
the trajectory of a shed particle that considers the collision between the
particle and the surface of an asteroid. Monte Carlo simulations are performed
to reflect the statistical behavior of shed particles. We also introduce
zero-velocity surfaces to our data-based analysis in order to reveal the
intrinsic invariance of the evolutionary processes. We used the average
mechanical energy of the particle cloud to check the connection between contact
property and the temporal-spatial distribution of the shed particles. We sketch
a common evolutionary path of the particle in the vicinity of a fast-rotating
asteroid, that is, particles dislodged from the unstable region will eventually
enter, through several collisions with the surface, non-return orbits that
launch from the minimum geopotential area of the unstable region. The common
trend is independent of any particular asteroid morphology, and all shed
particles enter the same evolutionary path. We also find that the orbital
energy of the particle cloud is statistically independent of the surface
contact property, meaning that the collision coefficient of restitution is a
nonsensitive parameter in the outward spreading process of the shed particles.

work we test another hypothesis, namely that different assumptions on yield
modeling may be at play simultaneously. We compare whether the abundance
patterns spanned by the models are consistent with those observed in Galactic
data. First, we test the performance of recent yield tabulations, and we show
which of these tabulations best fit Galactic stellar abundances. We then group
the models and test if yield combinations match data scatter and standard
deviation. On a fixed Milky-Way-like parametrization of NuPyCEE, we test a
selection of yields for the three dominant yield sets: low-to-intermediate mass
stars, massive stars, and Type Ia supernovae. We also include the production of
r-process elements by neutron star mergers. We explore the statistical
properties spanned by such yields. We identify the differences and
commonalities among yield sets. We define criteria that estimate whether an
element is in agreement with the data, or if the model overestimates or
underestimates it in various redshift bins. While it is true that yields are a
major source of uncertainty in GCE models, the scatter of abundances in stellar

accurate reconstruction of four-dimensional (4D)-spectral-spatial (SS) images

Basing on a discrete-to-discrete data model devised in CW EPRI employing the
Zeeman-modulation (ZM) scheme for data acquisition, we first formulate the
image reconstruction problem as a convex, constrained optimization program that
includes a data fidelity term and also constraints on the individual
directional total variations (DTVs) of the 4D-SS image. Subsequently, we
develop a primal-dual-based DTV algorithm, simply referred to as the DTV
algorithm, to solve the constrained optimization program for achieving image
reconstruction from data collected in LAR scans in CW-ZM EPRI. Results: We
evaluate the DTV algorithm in simulated- and real-data studies for a variety of
LAR scans of interest in CW-ZM EPRI, and visual and quantitative results of the
studies reveal that 4D-SS images can be reconstructed directly from LAR data,
which are visually and quantitatively comparable to those obtained from data
acquired in the standard, full-angular-range (FAR) scan in CW-ZM EPRI.
Conclusion: An optimization-based DTV algorithm is developed for accurately
reconstructing 4D-SS images directly from LAR data in CW-ZM EPRI. Future work
includes the development and application of the optimization-based DTV
algorithm for reconstructions of 4D-SS images from FAR and LAR data acquired in
CW EPRI employing schemes other than the ZM scheme. Significance: The DTV
algorithm developed may be exploited potentially for enabling and optimizing CW
EPRI with minimized imaging time and artifacts by acquiring data in LAR scans.

cluster centers of inliers during training. Therefore, when performing
inference on a medical image in real-world scenarios, the similarity between
pixels and the queries detects and localizes OOD regions. We term this OOD
localization as MaxQuery. Furthermore, the foregrounds of real-world medical
images, whether OOD objects or inliers, are lesions. The difference between
them is less than that between the foreground and background, possibly
misleading the object queries to focus redundantly on the background. Thus, we
propose a query-distribution (QD) loss to enforce clear boundaries between
segmentation targets and other regions at the query level, improving the inlier
segmentation and OOD indication. Our proposed framework is tested on two

images (B0) acquired with different phase-encoding directions, and they can
take hours to process per subject. Since a great amount of diffusion data are
only acquired with a single phase-encoding direction, the application of
existing approaches is limited. We propose a deep learning-based registration
approach to correct distortion using only the B0 acquired from a single
phase-encoding direction. Specifically, we register undistorted T1-weighted
images and distorted B0 to remove the distortion through a deep learning model.
We apply a differentiable mutual information loss during training to improve
inter-modality alignment. Experiments on the Human Connectome Project dataset
show the proposed method outperforms SyN and VoxelMorph on several metrics, and
only takes a few seconds to process one subject.

high semantic image representation. The intuition of MaskDeep lies in the fact
that models can reason from sparse visible patches semantic to the global
semantic of the image. We further propose three designs in our framework: 1) a
Hierarchical Deep-Masking module to concern the hierarchical property of patch
representations, 2) a multi-group strategy to improve the efficiency without
any extra computing consumption of the encoder and 3) a multi-target strategy
to provide more description of the global semantic. Our MaskDeep brings decent

time-consuming training processes. Broad Learning System (BLS) and its
convolutional variants have been proposed to mitigate these issues and have
achieved superb performance in image classification. However, the existing
convolutional-based broad learning system (C-BLS) either lacks an efficient
training method and incremental learning capability or suffers from poor
performance. To this end, we propose a convolutional broad learning system
(ConvBLS) based on the spherical K-means (SKM) algorithm and two-stage
multi-scale (TSMS) feature fusion, which consists of the convolutional feature
(CF) layer, convolutional enhancement (CE) layer, TSMS feature fusion layer,
and output layer. First, unlike the current C-BLS, the simple yet efficient SKM
algorithm is utilized to learn the weights of CF layers. Compared with random
filters, the SKM algorithm makes the CF layer learn more comprehensive spatial
features. Second, similar to the vanilla BLS, CE layers are established to
expand the feature space. Third, the TSMS feature fusion layer is proposed to
extract more effective multi-scale features through the integration of CF
layers and CE layers. Thanks to the above design and the pseudo-inverse
calculation of the output layer weights, our proposed ConvBLS method is
unprecedentedly efficient and effective. Finally, the corresponding incremental
learning algorithms are presented for rapid remodeling if the model deems to
expand. Experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of our method.

propagation characteristics of electromagnetic channels and boost the channel
capacity. Unfortunately, the application of the electromagnetic theory to the
electromagnetically large (compared to the wave-length) antenna arrays leads to
a non-separable correlation structure for the small-scale fading due to the
coupling effect between the transmit and receive antennas. Such a non-separable
correlation structure poses challenging issues for characterizing the
fundamental limits of holographic MIMO channels, which has not been tackled in
the literature. In this paper, we investigate the distribution for the mutual
information (MI) of holographic MIMO systems with the non-separable channel
correlation, where both the line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight components are
considered. We set up a central limit theorem for the MI by random matrix
theory (RMT) and give the closed-form expressions for the mean and variance.
The derived results are used to approximate the outage probability and reveal
interesting physical insights regarding the impact of antenna spacing. It is
shown that reducing antenna spacing will improve the ergodic MI and decrease
the outage probability of holographic MIMO systems. The scaling law of the
ergodic MI with respect to the antenna spacing is also derived. Numerical

interferometric angular diameters to calculate the effective temperature, as
well as six M dwarfs that are common proper motion companions to FGK-type
primaries with known metallicity. After training a deep learning (DL) neural
network model on synthetic PHOENIX-ACES spectra, we used the internal feature
representations together with those 14+6 stars with independent parameter
measurements as a new input for the transfer process. We compare the derived
stellar parameters of a small sample of M dwarfs kept out of the training phase
with results from other methods in the literature. Assuming that temperatures
from bolometric luminosities and interferometric radii and metallicities from
FGK+M binaries are sufficiently accurate, DTL provides a higher accuracy than
our previous state-of-the-art DL method (mean absolute differences improve by
20 K for temperature and 0.2 dex for metallicity from DL to DTL when compared
with reference values from interferometry and FGK+M binaries). Furthermore, the
machine learning (internal) precision of DTL also improves as uncertainties are
five times smaller on average. These results indicate that DTL is a robust tool
for obtaining M-dwarf stellar parameters comparable to those obtained from
independent estimations for well-known stars.

aspect of leader-follower formation control. In this architecture, the leader
moves toward the target by taking optimal actions, and followers should also
avoid obstacles while maintaining their desired formation shape. Most of the
studies in this field have inspected formation control and obstacle avoidance
separately. The present study proposes a new approach based on deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) for end-to-end motion planning and control of
under-actuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The aim is to design
optimal adaptive distributed controllers based on actor-critic structure for
AUVs formation motion planning. This is accomplished by controlling the speed
and heading of AUVs. In obstacle avoidance, two approaches have been deployed.
In the first approach, the goal is to design control policies for the leader
and followers such that each learns its own collision-free path. Moreover, the
followers adhere to an overall formation maintenance policy. In the second
approach, the leader solely learns the control policy, and safely leads the
whole group towards the target. Here, the control policy of the followers is to
maintain the predetermined distance and angle. In the presence of ocean
currents, communication delays, and sensing errors, the robustness of the
proposed method under realistically perturbed circumstances is shown. The
efficiency of the algorithms has been evaluated and approved using a number of
computer-based simulations.

problem of a human finger attached with thin McKibben muscles. To achieve
precise control with thin McKibben muscles, there are two problems: one is the
complex characteristics of the muscles, for example, non-linearity, hysteresis,
uncertainties in the real world, and the other is the difficulty in accessing a
precise model of the muscles and human fingers. To solve these problems, we
adopted DreamerV2, which is a model-based reinforcement learning method, but
the target trajectory cannot be generated by the learned model. Therefore, we
propose Tracker, which is an extension of DreamerV2 for the tracking control
problem. In the experiment, we showed that Tracker can achieve an approximately

imitates a part of human index finger from the metacarpal bone to the proximal

demonstrates Fano profiles, in the output field, which is well-tuned by
adjusting the system parameters, like effective magnomechanical coupling,
magnon detuning, and cavity detuning. It is found that the magnetoelastic

applications, e.g., online recommendation, database retrieval, and
query-document searching. Given a query node, the conventional approaches rely
on the similarity matching with the vectorized node embeddings in the
continuous Euclidean space. To efficiently manage intensive similarity
computation, developing hashing techniques for graph structured data has
recently become an emerging research direction. Despite the retrieval
efficiency in Hamming space, prior work is however confronted with catastrophic
performance decay. In this work, we investigate the problem of hashing with
Graph Convolutional Network on bipartite graphs for effective Top-N search. We
propose an end-to-end Bipartite Graph Convolutional Hashing approach, namely
BGCH, which consists of three novel and effective modules: (1) adaptive graph
convolutional hashing, (2) latent feature dispersion, and (3) Fourier
serialized gradient estimation. Specifically, the former two modules achieve
the substantial retention of the structural information against the inevitable
information loss in hash encoding; the last module develops Fourier Series
decomposition to the hashing function in the frequency domain mainly for more
accurate gradient estimation. The extensive experiments on six real-world
datasets not only show the performance superiority over the competing
hashing-based counterparts, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of all
proposed model components contained therein.

  Loss","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2211.10927",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Siamese trackers based on 3D region proposal network (RPN) have shown
remarkable success with deep Hough voting. However, using a single seed point
feature as the cue for voting fails to produce high-quality 3D proposals.
Additionally, the equal treatment of seed points in the voting process,
regardless of their significance, exacerbates this limitation. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel transformer-based voting scheme to generate
better proposals. Specifically, a global-local transformer (GLT) module is
devised to integrate object- and patch-aware geometric priors into seed point
features, resulting in robust and accurate cues for offset learning of seed
points. To train the GLT module, we introduce an importance prediction branch
that learns the potential importance weights of seed points as a training
constraint. Incorporating this transformer-based voting scheme into 3D RPN, a
novel Siamese method dubbed GLT-T is developed for 3D single object tracking on
point clouds. Moreover, we identify that the highest-scored proposal in the
Siamese paradigm may not be the most accurate proposal, which limits tracking
performance. Towards this concern, we approach the binary score prediction task
as a ranking problem, and design a target-aware ranking loss and a
localization-aware ranking loss to produce accurate ranking of proposals. With
the ranking losses, we further present GLT-T++, an enhanced version of GLT-T.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our GLT-T and
GLT-T++ outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of tracking accuracy while
maintaining a real-time inference speed. The source code will be made available

in today's software development, is often costly in terms of computational
resources and time. With the inspiration of software reuse, building DNN models
through reusing existing ones has gained increasing attention recently. Prior
approaches to DNN model reuse have two main limitations: 1) reusing the entire
model, while only a small part of the model's functionalities (labels) are
required, would cause much overhead (e.g., computational and time costs for
inference), and 2) model reuse would inherit the defects and weaknesses of the
reused model, and hence put the new system under threats of security attack. To
solve the above problem, we propose SeaM, a tool that re-engineers a trained
DNN model to improve its reusability. Specifically, given a target problem and
a trained model, SeaM utilizes a gradient-based search method to search for the
model's weights that are relevant to the target problem. The re-engineered
model that only retains the relevant weights is then reused to solve the target
problem. Evaluation results on widely-used models show that the re-engineered
models produced by SeaM only contain 10.11% weights of the original models,
resulting 42.41% reduction in terms of inference time. For the target problem,
the re-engineered models even outperform the original models in classification
accuracy by 5.85%. Moreover, reusing the re-engineered models inherits an
average of 57% fewer defects than reusing the entire model. We believe our
approach to reducing reuse overhead and defect inheritance is one important
step forward for practical model reuse.

non-compliance with routing instructions. In this article we model the

control. We consider traffic routing for two parallel links. Particularly, we
consider two scenarios: one ignores congestion spillback while the other one
considers it. We formulate the problem as a non-linear Markov chain, given
random compliance rates. Then we propose the stability and instability
conditions to reveal when the routing is able or unable to stabilize the
traffic. We show that for links without congestion spillback there exists a
sufficient and necessary stability criterion. For links admiting congestion

and memory resources. Quantization stands out as a solution by representing the
network in low-bit parameters and operations. However, there is a significant
performance drop when performing low-bit quantized DETR (Q-DETR) with existing
quantization methods. We find that the bottlenecks of Q-DETR come from the
query information distortion through our empirical analyses. This paper
addresses this problem based on a distribution rectification distillation
(DRD). We formulate our DRD as a bi-level optimization problem, which can be
derived by generalizing the information bottleneck (IB) principle to the
learning of Q-DETR. At the inner level, we conduct a distribution alignment for
the queries to maximize the self-information entropy. At the upper level, we
introduce a new foreground-aware query matching scheme to effectively transfer
the teacher information to distillation-desired features to minimize the
conditional information entropy. Extensive experimental results show that our
method performs much better than prior arts. For example, the 4-bit Q-DETR can

the independent testing set consisting of 1,749 women, our approach achieved
superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art models with area under
the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.905, 0.872 and 0.866

study highlights the importance of incorporating various deep learning
mechanisms, such as image attention, radiomic features, gating mechanism, and
bilateral asymmetry-based fine-tuning, to improve the accuracy of breast cancer
risk assessment. We also demonstrate that our model's performance was enhanced
by leveraging spatiotemporal information from sequential mammograms. Our
findings suggest that RADIFUSION can provide clinicians with a powerful tool
for breast cancer risk assessment.

density functional theory calculations giving access to simulations of the FE
domain wall (DW) topology. This allows us to estimate the energetic hierarchy

the values of \b{eta} suggest a regional dependence which could be a
manifestation of different seismic dynamics in various regions. This new

network compression. In the realization, the salience mechanism is used as a
metric of channel salience to guide pruning. Therefore, salience-based channel
pruning can dynamically adjust the channel width at run-time, which provides a
flexible pruning scheme. However, there are two problems emerging: a gating
function is often needed to truncate the specific salience entries to zero,
which destabilizes the forward propagation; dynamic architecture brings more
cost for indexing in inference which bottlenecks the inference speed. In this
paper, we propose a Progressive Channel-Shrinking (PCS) method to compress the
selected salience entries at run-time instead of roughly approximating them to
zero. We also propose a Running Shrinking Policy to provide a testing-static
pruning scheme that can reduce the memory access cost for filter indexing. We
evaluate our method on ImageNet and CIFAR10 datasets over two prevalent
networks: ResNet and VGG, and demonstrate that our PCS outperforms all
baselines and achieves state-of-the-art in terms of compression-performance
tradeoff. Moreover, we observe a significant and practical acceleration of

efficient and useful alternative for several machine learning (ML) tasks such
as sequence classification. Three challenges with kernel methods are (i) the
computation time, (ii) the memory usage (storing an $n\times n$ matrix), and
(iii) the usage of kernel matrices limited to kernel-based ML methods
(difficult to generalize on non-kernel classifiers). While (i) can be solved
using approximate methods, challenge (ii) remains for typical kernel methods.
Similarly, although non-kernel-based ML methods can be applied to kernel
matrices by extracting principal components (kernel PCA), it may result in
information loss, while being computationally expensive. In this paper, we
propose a general-purpose representation learning approach that embodies kernel
methods' qualities while avoiding computation, memory, and generalizability
challenges. This involves computing a low-dimensional embedding of each

significantly reducing the computation needed to compute the dot product and
the memory needed to store the resulting representation. Our proposed fast and

physical forces generated by the actin cytoskeleton. We have recently shown
that coupling curved membrane complexes to protrusive forces, exerted by the
actin polymerization that they recruit, provides a mechanism that can give rise
to spontaneous membrane shapes and patterns. In the presence of an adhesive
substrate, this model was shown to give rise to an emergent motile phenotype,
resembling a motile cell. Here, we utilize this ``minimal-cell"" model to
explore the impact of external shear flow on the cell shape and migration on a
uniform adhesive flat substrate. We find that in the presence of shear the
motile cell reorients such that its leading edge, where the curved active
proteins aggregate, faces the shear flow. The flow-facing configuration is
found to minimize the adhesion energy by allowing the cell to spread more
efficiently over the substrate. For the non-motile vesicle shapes, we find that
they mostly slide and roll with the shear flow. We compare these theoretical
results with experimental observations, and suggest that the tendency of many
cell types to move against the flow may arise from the very general, and

the local wavefunction of the resulting dark state yields a spatially uniform
Born-Oppenheimer potential augmented by geometric scalar and vector potentials
appearing due to spatially rapid changes of the wavefunction. Depending on

from a 2D analogue of the Kronig-Penney lattice, to an array of tubes with a
zig-zag shaped barrier. The geometric vector potential induces a spatially
periodic effective magnetic field (the Berry's curvature) that can be tuned to
cause destructive interference between neighboring tubes, thereby decoupling
them at a critical point in parameter space. We numerically investigate the
energy spectrum including decay from the excited state, and find that the
adiabatic approximation is sound for strong coupling strengths, leading to
negligible loss in the dark state manifold. Furthermore, the spectrum is
well-described by a non-Hermitian tight binding model with on-site losses, and

a scalar field in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in maximally symmetric
space-time. This study is useful for giving meaning to the presence of two
Gauss-Bonnet vacua, instead of using the spherically symmetric bubbles of the
""true"" vacuum expand in the ""false"" vacuum. The theory admits two possible
effective cosmological constants, which lead to two maximally symmetric vacuum
solutions. The first solution corresponds to the dynamics of dark energy. When
there is matter, the second solution describes dark matter. In
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we establish the expression of the topological
mass spectrum which depends on the golden ratio and its inverse. In the
Schwarzschild limit, the topological density corresponds to the standard model
radiation energy density. We find the mass loss rate which gives the evolution
of mass over time.

well, and we conclude that this is likely because much of England's wealth is
concentrated in London, as are most of England's Pret-a-Manger shops. Further
studies were conducted based on the relative geographical distributions of
popular supermarkets Morrisons and Waitrose, which are also considered to have

interstellar medium, where they play a central role in determining the gas
chemical composition and drastically influence the formation of stars and
planets. Over the last few decades, H$_3^+$ absorption lines observations in
diffuse clouds have provided reliable estimates of the cosmic ray ionisation
rate relative to H$_2$ ($\zeta^{\rm ion}_{{\rm H}_2}$). However, in denser
clouds, where stars and planets form, this method is often inefficient due to
the lack of H$_3^+$ rotational transitions. The $\zeta^{\rm ion}_{{\rm H}_2}$
estimates are, therefore, still provisional in this context and represent one
of the least understood components when it comes to defining general models of
star and planet formation. In this Letter, we present the first high-resolution
maps of the $\zeta^{\rm ion}_{{\rm H}_2}$ in two high-mass clumps obtained with
a new analytical approach recently proposed to estimate the $\zeta^{\rm

games that makes time seem to slow down or stop while still preserving dynamic
details in the scene. It usually requires multiple sets of cameras to move
slowly with the subject and is synthesized using post-production techniques,
which is costly and one-time. The dynamic scene perspective reconstruction
technology based on neural rendering field can be used to solve this
requirement, but most of the current methods are poor in reconstruction
accuracy due to the blurred input image and overfitting of dynamic and static
regions. Based on the NSFF algorithm, this paper reconstructed the common time
special effects scenes in movies and television from a new perspective. To
improve the accuracy of the reconstructed images, fuzzy kernel was added to the
network for reconstruction and analysis of the fuzzy process, and the clear
perspective after analysis was input into the NSFF to improve the accuracy. By
using the optical flow prediction information to suppress the dynamic network
timely, the network is forced to improve the reconstruction effect of dynamic
and static networks independently, and the ability to understand and
reconstruct dynamic and static scenes is improved. To solve the overfitting
problem of dynamic and static scenes, a new dynamic and static cross entropy
loss is designed. Experimental results show that compared with original NSFF
and other new perspective reconstruction algorithms of dynamic scenes, the
improved NSFF-RFCT improves the reconstruction accuracy and enhances the
understanding ability of dynamic and static scenes.

natural language descriptions to the CLIP text embedding space and then aligns
the textual embeddings to the representations of speaking styles. As extensive

next-generation communications due to some inherent constraints. In this
regard, OFDMA technology could be adopted to design an efficient MAC protocol

  The purpose of this research is to provide a high-speed network for Wi-Fi
users. The thesis presents three MAC protocols, namely, HTFA (High Throughput
and Fair Access), ERA (Efficient Resource Allocation), and PRS (Proportional
Resource Scheduling), by employing the OFDMA technology. The novel protocols
improve Wi-Fi communication using the latest IEEE 802.11ax standard, i.e.,
Wi-Fi 6. In particular, the protocols improve several performance parameters of
the MAC protocol, such as increasing the throughput, goodput, fairness index,
and reducing the packet retransmissions, collisions, etc. Simulation results
validate that the new protocols are far better than the existing protocols.
  The protocols designed in this thesis are compliant with the latest IEEE
802.11ax standard that promises to enhance the throughput at least four times
per user and support ten times users. Thus, the new protocols can ensure
uninterrupted and smooth communication in highly dense environments. The thesis
contains a lot of resources such as the state of the art of MAC protocols,
analysis of contemporary protocols and their performance matrix; architecture
of Wi-Fi system, OFDMA constraints and regulations; framework of protocols;
analytical models; relevant data, theory, and methods; etc. that would be the

to this second-order information, we can shape a NeRF to express semantically
meaningful synergies when the network weights are changed by a delta along the

scene entities that emerges from our shaping to perform label propagation for
semantic and instance segmentation. Our experiments show that a JacobiNeRF is

approach can reduce the growth in dimensionality of the search space from
exponential to linear in the number of agents. On average, fewer samples are
needed to find high-quality solutions while preserving the optimality,
completeness, and anytime properties of SBAs. We present a general
implementation of a factorized SBA, derive an analytical gain in terms of
sample complexity for PRM*, and showcase empirical results for RRG.

Meanwhile, these transitions can have instantaneous, unbounded effects on

argue that in the high temperature limit the thermofield double state is the

correspond to a black hole at one time connected behind the horizon to the same

modern intelligent services. However, not Independent and Identically
Distributed (non-IID) distribution among edge clients can impair the local
model performance. The existing single prototype-based strategy represents a
sample by using the mean of the feature space. However, feature spaces are
usually not clustered, and a single prototype may not represent a sample well.
Motivated by this, this paper proposes a multi-prototype federated contrastive
learning approach (MP-FedCL) which demonstrates the effectiveness of using a
multi-prototype strategy over a single-prototype under non-IID settings,
including both label and feature skewness. Specifically, a multi-prototype
computation strategy based on \textit{k-means} is first proposed to capture
different embedding representations for each class space, using multiple
prototypes ($k$ centroids) to represent a class in the embedding space. In each
global round, the computed multiple prototypes and their respective model
parameters are sent to the edge server for aggregation into a global prototype
pool, which is then sent back to all clients to guide their local training.
Finally, local training for each client minimizes their own supervised learning
tasks and learns from shared prototypes in the global prototype pool through
supervised contrastive learning, which encourages them to learn knowledge
related to their own class from others and reduces the absorption of unrelated
knowledge in each global iteration. Experimental results on MNIST, Digit-5,
Office-10, and DomainNet show that our method outperforms multiple baselines,
with an average test accuracy improvement of about 4.6\% and 10.4\% under
feature and label non-IID distributions, respectively.

impediment for novice users is that Isabelle/HOL requires all definitions to be
declared before they are used, where (mutually) recursive definitions must be
defined in tandem. In this paper, we describe a solution to this problem, which
will enable wider access to the translator plugin for novice users as well as
real models.

"2305.04838","Kai Ren","Kai Ren","An Empirical Study of Capital Asset Pricing Model based on Chinese
  A-share Trading Data","28 pages, in Chinese language, 3 figures, 12 tables",,,,"q-fin.ST","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  This paper presents an empirical analysis of the capital asset pricing model
using trading data for the Chinese A-share market from 2000 to 2019. Firstly,
the standard CAPM is tested using a Fama-MacBetch regression and although the
results successfully test the three core hypotheses, the resulting beta risk
does not have a significant impact on returns. Secondly, the Fama-French
three-factor model, which uses a combination of market, size and value factors
to price capital assets, is analysed, showing that it is able to capture most
of the variation in A-share market returns, with an adjusted R-squared greater
than 0.88 for the 25 portfolios constructed. Finally, the paper takes into
account the ""shell value contamination"" problem caused by IPO regulation in the
Chinese stock market, and minimises its impact by excluding stocks in the
lowest 30% of the market capitalisation, which allows some of the anomalous
results in the three-factor model to be effectively corrected. Although this
paper does not present a more innovative approach, it is unique in its data
selection and presents a detailed presentation of the data processing and
regression analysis process, which 1) illustrates the applicability of capital
asset pricing models in the Chinese market; and 2) provides a set of open
source materials for the basic learning of capital asset pricing models.

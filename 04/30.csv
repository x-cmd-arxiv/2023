Automatic segmentation of colon polyps can significantly reduce the
misdiagnosis of colon cancer and improve physician annotation efficiency. While
many methods have been proposed for polyp segmentation, training large-scale
segmentation networks with limited colonoscopy data remains a challenge.
Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has recently gained much attention
in both natural and medical image segmentation. SAM demonstrates superior
performance in several image benchmarks and therefore shows great potential for
medical image segmentation. In this study, we propose Poly-SAM, a finetuned SAM
model for polyp segmentation, and compare its performance to several
state-of-the-art polyp segmentation models. We also compare two transfer
learning strategies of SAM with and without finetuning its encoders. Evaluated
on five public datasets, our Polyp-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on
two datasets and impressive performance on three datasets, with dice scores all
above 88%. This study demonstrates the great potential of adapting SAM to
medical image segmentation tasks. We plan to release the code and model weights

bifurcations, and the possibility for chaotic dynamics. On the other hand,
toric dynamical systems are polynomial dynamical systems that appear naturally
as models of reaction networks, and have very robust and stable properties. A

a reaction network $\mathcal N$ and some choice of positive parameters, such

assimilating noisy observations into a deterministic model has been the
workhorse of forecasting centers for over three decades. While this method
provides a computationally efficient framework for dynamic data assimilation,
it is largely silent on the important question concerning the minimum number
and placement of observations. To answer this question, we demonstrate the dual
advantage of placing the observations where the square of the sensitivity of
the model solution with respect to the unknown control variables, called
forward sensitivities, attains its maximum. Therefore, we can force the
observability Gramian to be of full rank, which in turn guarantees efficient
recovery of the optimal values of the control variables, which is the first of
the two advantages of this strategy. We further show that the proposed strategy
of placing observations has another inherent optimality: the square of the
sensitivity of the optimal estimates of the control with respect to the
observations (used to obtain these estimates) attains its minimum value, a
second advantage that is a direct consequence of the above strategy for placing
observations. Our analytical framework and numerical experiments on linear and
nonlinear systems confirm the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.

Using sound event labels is expected to control the sound event class of the

However, the lack of a holistic study of a statistically significant and
unbiased sample of these objects makes several long-standing questions about
their nature to remain unsolved. The present and other upcoming papers of the
IACOB series are focused in studying - from a pure empirical point of view - a
sample of 500 Galactic O9 - B9 stars with luminosity classes I and II (plus 250
late O- and early B-type stars with luminosity classes III, IV and V) and
covering distances up to 4 kpc from the Sun. We compile an initial set of 11000
high-resolution spectra of 1600 Galactic late O- and B-type stars. We use a new
novel spectroscopic strategy based on a simple fitting of the Hbeta line to
select stars in a specific region of the spectroscopic HR diagram. We evaluate
the completeness of our sample using the Alma Luminous Star catalog (ALS III)
and Gaia-DR3 data. We show the benefits of the proposed strategy for
identifying BSGs descending from stellar objects born as O-type stars, in the
context of single star evolution. The resulting sample reaches a high level of
completeness with respect to the ALS III catalog, gathering the 80% for all-sky
targets brighter than Bmag < 9 located within 2 kpc. However, we identify the
need for new observations in specific regions of the Southern hemisphere. In
conclusion, we have explored a very fast and robust method to select BSGs,
providing a valuable tool for large spectroscopic surveys like WEAVE-SCIP or
4MIDABLE-LR, and highlighting the risk of using spectral classifications from
the literature. Upcoming works will make use of this large and homogeneous

We conduct the molecular dynamics (MD) modeling of clay samples consisting of
hexagonal particles under compression and shear. The MD simulations include
oedometer creep, shear creep, direct shear tests, and stress relaxation. The
numerical results show that the nanoscale creep mechanism of clay is related to
particle rotation, translation, and stacking under different loading
conditions. The clay sample under creep shows two types of particle
arrangements, i.e., the shifted face-to-face configuration and the face-to-edge
configuration. The orientation angle of clay particles is computed to track the
rotation of individual particles due to creep. The fabric variation of the clay
under creep is characterized by the dihedral angle between the basal particle
plane and the x-y plane and the order parameter. It is found that the factors
affecting the microstructure variation of the clay aggregate include stress
levels, loading rates, and particle sizes. In the nanoscale shear creep test,
the creep process comprises three stages, i.e., primary, secondary, and
tertiary. The microstructure change during creep depends on the initial
alignment of clay particles. The clay creep under a more significant stress
level results in a more considerable order parameter and a more orientated clay
structure.

learning tasks which are presented sequentially to the learner. A key challenge
in this setting is that the learner may forget how to solve a previous task

address this challenge, many practical methods have been proposed, including
memory-based, regularization-based, and expansion-based methods. However, a
rigorous theoretical understanding of these methods remains elusive. This paper
aims to bridge this gap between theory and practice by proposing a new
continual learning framework called Ideal Continual Learner (ICL), which is
guaranteed to avoid catastrophic forgetting by construction. We show that ICL
unifies multiple well-established continual learning methods and gives new
theoretical insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. We
also derive generalization bounds for ICL which allow us to theoretically
quantify how rehearsal affects generalization. Finally, we connect ICL to
several classic subjects and research topics of modern interest, which allows
us to make historical remarks and inspire future directions.

policies, encoded as Doubly-Stochastic (DS) matrices, that satisfy desired
ranking constraints in expectation, e.g., Fairness of Exposure (FOE). These
strategies are generally two-stage pipelines: \emph{i)} an offline re-ranking
policy construction step and \emph{ii)} an online sampling of rankings step.
Building a re-ranking policy requires repeatedly solving a constrained
optimization problem, one for each issued query. Thus, it is necessary to
recompute the optimization procedure for any new/unseen query. Regarding
sampling, the Birkhoff-von-Neumann decomposition (BvND) is the favored approach
to draw rankings from any DS-based policy. However, the BvND is too costly to
compute online. Hence, the BvND as a sampling solution is memory-consuming as
it can grow as $\gO(N\, n^2)$ for $N$ queries and $n$ documents.
  This paper offers a novel, fast, lightweight way to predict fair stochastic
re-ranking policies: Constrained Meta-Optimal Transport (CoMOT). This method
fits a neural network shared across queries like a learning-to-rank system. We
also introduce Gumbel-Matching Sampling (GumMS), an online sampling approach
from DS-based policies. Our proposed pipeline, CoMOT + GumMS, only needs to
store the parameters of a single model, and it generalizes to unseen queries.
We empirically evaluated our pipeline on the TREC 2019 and 2020 datasets under
FOE constraints. Our experiments show that CoMOT rapidly predicts fair
re-ranking policies on held-out data, with a speed-up proportional to the
average number of documents per query. It also displays fairness and ranking
performance similar to the original optimization-based policy. Furthermore, we
empirically validate the effectiveness of GumMS to approximate DS-based
policies in expectation.

individuals captured over a distributed network of RGB and IR cameras. The task
is challenging due to the significant differences between V and I modalities,
especially under real-world conditions, where images are corrupted by, e.g,
blur, noise, and weather. Indeed, state-of-art V-I ReID models cannot leverage
corrupted modality information to sustain a high level of accuracy. In this
paper, we propose an efficient model for multimodal V-I ReID -- named
Multimodal Middle Stream Fusion (MMSF) -- that preserves modality-specific
knowledge for improved robustness to corrupted multimodal images. In addition,
three state-of-art attention-based multimodal fusion models are adapted to
address corrupted multimodal data in V-I ReID, allowing to dynamically balance
each modality importance. Recently, evaluation protocols have been proposed to
assess the robustness of ReID models under challenging real-world scenarios.
However, these protocols are limited to unimodal V settings. For realistic
evaluation of multimodal (and cross-modal) V-I person ReID models, we propose
new challenging corrupted datasets for scenarios where V and I cameras are
co-located (CL) and not co-located (NCL). Finally, the benefits of our Masking

improve the robustness of ReID models to multimodal corruption. Our experiments
on clean and corrupted versions of the SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and ThermalWORLD
datasets indicate the multimodal V-I ReID models that are more likely to
perform well in real-world operational conditions. In particular, our ML-MDA is
an important strategy for a V-I person ReID system to sustain high accuracy and
robustness when processing corrupted multimodal images. Also, our multimodal
ReID model MMSF outperforms every method under CL and NCL camera scenarios.

in terms of performance (Precision, Recall and F-measure) and execution time.
Results: Our findings provide empirical evidence that while some Frequent

some cases, the results are not consistent throughout all the software

However, generalizing these algorithms to efficiently compute the posterior

significantly reduce the time complexity of computing the acquisition function

micron-scale imaging using nearly monochromatic X-rays at synchrotron
beamlines. XPCT enables an order of magnitude improvement in image contrast of
the reconstructed material interfaces with low X-ray absorption contrast. The
dominant approaches to 3D reconstruction using XPCT relies on the use of
phase-retrieval algorithms that make one or more limiting approximations for
the experimental configuration and material properties. Since many experimental
scenarios violate such approximations, the resulting reconstructions contain
blur, artifacts, or other quantitative inaccuracies. Our solution to this
problem is to formulate new iterative non-linear phase-retrieval (NLPR)
algorithms that avoid such limiting approximations. Compared to the widely used
state-of-the-art approaches, we show that our proposed algorithms result in
sharp and quantitatively accurate reconstruction with reduced artifacts. Unlike
existing NLPR algorithms, our approaches avoid the laborious manual tuning of
regularization hyper-parameters while still achieving the stated goals. As an
alternative to regularization, we propose explicit constraints on the material
properties to constrain the solution space and solve the phase-retrieval
problem. These constraints are easily user-configurable since they follow
directly from the imaged object's dimensions and material properties.

The large number of different settings, and also the presence of uncertainties

scheme due to its easy adaptation to the OAT problem. Numerical experiments are
conducted showing that, when out-of-distribution generalization (against
variations in parameters such as the location of the sensors) is imposed, there
is no degradation of the performance and, in some cases, it is even possible to
achieve improvements with respect to standard deep learning approaches where

underestimate or overestimate the price. In this paper, we demonstrate how
Gaussian process models can predict the distribution of the minimum price in an

because these processes account for time correlations between blocks. We
performed an empirical analysis using the Gaussian process model on historical

greatly, the Gaussian process model offers a better estimation. Further, we
demonstrated that GasStation-Express and Geth can be improved upon by using a
smaller training sample size which is properly pre-processed. Based on the
results of empirical analysis, we recommended a gas price oracle made up of a
hybrid model consisting of both the Gaussian process and GasStation-Express.

for over a century. However, the inherent complexity of ecological systems
makes simple models subject to modeling bias due to simplifying assumptions or

communities. Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) have surged
recently as a machine-learning algorithm that preserves the dynamic nature of
the data. NODEs consist of dynamical models where populations are modeled using
a neural network instead of a parametric function. This preservation of the
data dynamics is an advantage for modeling ecological time series in comparison
to other state-of-the-art methods. However, the question of how NODEs perform
as a forecasting tool of ecological communities is still unanswered. Here we
explore this question using simulated time series of population densities of
multiple competing species in a time-varying environment. We explore the
performance of NODEs by fitting them using time series of different community
sizes and different training data sizes. We find that NODEs provide less
uncertain forecasts than the standard ARIMA models. In addition, we find that
combining NODEs with parametric models can recover the final community size of
our simulated time series better than ARIMA or NODE models. We also discuss
ways to improve the forecasting performance of NODEs. The power of a
forecasting tool such as NODEs is that it can provide insights into population
dynamics and should thus broaden the approaches to studying time series of
ecological communities.

(multiple) discrete delays, supporting both systems of retarded and neutral
type. TDS-CONTROL is based on a state-space representations for these TDSs,
although functionality is provided to obtain such a formulation from a
frequency-domain description of the system. Firstly, the package offers various
functionality for analyzing such systems, like methods for computing the
spectral abscissa, the H-infinity norm, the pseudospectral abscissa, and the
distance to instability. Furthermore, as TDS-CONTROL is designed with neutral
time-delay systems in mind, it has the appealing feature that the sensitivity
of certain quantities (such as the spectral abscissa) with respect to
infinitesimal delay perturbations can explicitly be taken into account.
Secondly, TDS-CONTROL also allows to design fixed-order dynamic output feedback
controllers. The corresponding controller-design algorithms are based on
minimizing the spectral abscissa, the H-infinity norm, or a combination of both
with respect to the free controller parameters by solving a non-smooth,
non-convex optimization problem. As a strictly negative spectral abscissa is a
necessary and sufficient condition for stability, the presented design methods
are thus not conservative. It is also possible to impose structure on the
controller, enabling the design of decentralized and
proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers. Furthermore, by allowing
the plant to be described in delay descriptor form (i.e., the system's dynamics
are given in terms of delay differential algebraic equations), acceleration
feedback and Pyragas-type and delay-based controllers can also be considered.

limit analysis of a generalised stochastic differential equation (SDE) model,
motivated by and encompassing the physical Brownian motion. We show that the
expected signature of the solution $\left\{P_t\right\}_{t \geq 0}$ for the

each degree of tensors and on each compact time interval $[0,T]$. The solution
$\left\{P_t\right\}_{t \geq 0}$, viewed as a rough path, generalises the
momentum of particle in classical physical Brownian motion. This singular limit
is identified through a delicate convergence analysis based on the graded PDE
system for the expected signature of It\^{o} diffusion processes. Explicit
closed-form solutions exhibiting intriguing combinatorial patterns are obtained
when the coefficient matrix $\mathbf{M}$ in our SDE, which generalises the
stress tensor in physical Brownian motion, is diagonalisable. Our work appears

  Transformer",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the increasing demand for video understanding, video moment and
highlight detection (MHD) has emerged as a critical research topic. MHD aims to
localize all moments and predict clip-wise saliency scores simultaneously.
Despite progress made by existing DETR-based methods, we observe that these
methods coarsely fuse features from different modalities, which weakens the
temporal intra-modal context and results in insufficient cross-modal
interaction. To address this issue, we propose MH-DETR (Moment and Highlight
Detection Transformer) tailored for MHD. Specifically, we introduce a simple
yet efficient pooling operator within the uni-modal encoder to capture global
intra-modal context. Moreover, to obtain temporally aligned cross-modal
features, we design a plug-and-play cross-modal interaction module between the
encoder and decoder, seamlessly integrating visual and textual features.
Comprehensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, Activity-Net, and
TVSum datasets show that MH-DETR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority. Our code is available at

state among a set of parties so that certain subsets can reconstruct the
secret, while unauthorized subsets obtain no information. While QSS was
introduced over twenty years ago, previous works focused only on existence of
perfectly secure schemes, and the share size of the known schemes is
exponential even for access structures computed by polynomial size monotone
circuits. This stands in contrast to the classical case, where efficient
computationally-secure schemes have been long known for all access structures
in $\mathsf{monotone~P}$, and one can even obtain shares which are much shorter
than the secret which is impossible with perfect security.
  In this work, we initiate the study of computationally-secure QSS and show
that computational assumptions help significantly in building QSS schemes. We
present a simple compiler and use it to obtain a large variety results: We
construct polynomial-time QSS schemes under standard assumptions for a rich
class of access structures. This includes many access structures for which
previous results in QSS required exponential share size. We also construct QSS
schemes for which the size of the shares is significantly smaller than the size
of the secret. As in the classical case, this is impossible with perfect
security.
  We also use our compiler to obtain results beyond computational QSS. In the
information-theoretic setting, we improve the share size of perfect QSS schemes
for a large class of access structures to $1.5^{n+o(n)}$, improving upon best
known schemes and matching the best known result for general access structures
in the classical case. Finally, we show construct efficient schemes for all
access structures in $\mathsf{P}$ and $\mathsf{NP}$ when the quantum secret
sharing scheme is given multiple of copies of the secret.

a decision-focused electricity price prediction approach for ESS arbitrage to
bridge the gap from the downstream optimization model to the prediction model.
The decision-focused approach aims at utilizing the downstream arbitrage model
for training prediction models. It measures the difference between actual
decisions under the predicted price and oracle decisions under the true price,
i.e., decision error, by regret, transforms it into the tractable surrogate
regret, and then derives the gradients to predicted price for training
prediction models. Based on the prediction and decision errors, this paper
proposes the hybrid loss and corresponding stochastic gradient descent learning

economic benefits and reduce decision errors by flattening the time
distribution of prediction errors, compared to prediction models for only
minimizing prediction errors.

indexes in particle and hole pairs in the ppRPA matrix, which only selects
frontier orbitals with dominant contributions to low-lying excitation energies.
It employs the truncation in both orbital indexes in the particle-particle and
the hole-hole spaces. The resulting matrix, the eigenvalues of which are
excitation energies, has a dimension that is independent of the size of the
systems. The computational effort for the excitation energy calculation,
therefore, scales linearly with system size and is negligible compared with the
ground-state calculation of the (N-2)-electron system, where N is the electron
number of the molecule. With the active space consisting of 30 occupied and 30
virtual orbitals, the active-space ppRPA approach predicts excitation energies
of valence, charge-transfer, Rydberg, double and diradical excitations with the
mean absolute errors (MAEs) smaller than 0.03 eV compared with the full-space

$(\eta,\phi_{\partial},\Sigma)$ and $(\omega,\phi_{\partial},\Sigma)$, with $v$
the velocity, $\eta$ the solenoidal velocity, $\phi_{\partial}$ a potential,
$\omega$ the vorticity, and $\Sigma$ the free surface, resulting in the
incompressible Euler equations in primitive variables and the vorticity
equation. First, the Hamiltonian formulation for the incompressible Euler
equations in a domain with a free surface combined with a fixed boundary
surface with a homogeneous boundary condition will be derived in the proper
Sobolev spaces of differential forms. Next, these results will be extended to
port-Hamiltonian formulations allowing inhomogeneous boundary conditions and a
non-zero energy flow through the boundaries. Our main results are the
construction and proof of Dirac structures in suitable Sobolev spaces of
differential forms for each variable set, which provides the core of any
port-Hamiltonian formulation. Finally, it is proven that the state dependent
Dirac structures are related to Poisson brackets that are linear,
skew-symmetric and satisfy the Jacobi identity.

takes a different view, what we call the open systems view, of the formalism;

specified by an in general non-unitary dynamical map. This includes, in
principle, the dynamics of the universe as a whole. We argue that the more
general dynamics describable in GT can be physically motivated, that there is
as much prima facie empirical support for GT as there is for ST, and that GT

in short, be little reason for an Everettian not to embrace the more general

approximated target location, in which the worst-case positioning error is
minimized via robust sensor selection. We derive expressions for the
Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) as a performance metric to quantify the
positioning accuracy resulted from selected sensors. For dynamic sensor
selection, two greedy selection strategies are proposed, each of which exploits
properties revealed in the derived CRLB expressions. These selection strategies
are shown to strike an efficient balance between computational complexity and
performance suboptimality. For robust sensor selection, we show that the
conventional convex relaxation approach leads to instability, and then develop
three algorithms based on (i) iterative convex optimization (ICO), (ii)

activation in hydrides, carbides, nitrides, and sulfides. The work functions
(WFs) of known hydrides, carbides, nitrides, oxides, and sulfides with group 3,
4, or 5 cations (Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, and Ta) were calculated. The WFs
of most hydrides, carbides, and nitrides are smaller than the WF of Ag,
implying that the electron scavenger effect may occur when late transition
metal nanoparticles are adsorbed on the surface. The WF of oxides and sulfides
decrease when reduced. The surface anion vacancy formation energy correlates
well with the bulk formation energy in carbides and nitrides, while almost no
correlation is found in hydrides because of the small range of surface hydrogen
vacancy formation energy values. The electron scavenger effect is explicitly
observed in nanorods adsorbed on TiH2 and Ti2O3; the surface vacancy formation
energy decreases at anion sites near the nanorod, and charge transfer to the

triality of questions offered by issues of basis building, unitarity and
non-polylogarithmicity in quantum field theory, specifically for planar two
loops. The interplay between the dual questions of setting up bases of
integrands and accurately preparing a complete set of cuts to secure correct
\emph{ans\""atze} of loop integrands expanded thereby is enriched by the
appearance of non-polylogarithmic structures, first seen in planar two loops in
the form of elliptic polylogarithms. We strengthen this by presenting an
extended discussion of a new method of building bases, classifying loop
integrands by power counting, or their behaviour in the ultraviolet and
studying a convenient, albeit manifestly non-canonical set of cuts of full
rank. By studying cut equations derived from poorly chosen contours in loop
momentum space, the question of finding morally good sets of cuts to
accommodate ellipticity at two loops is forced upon us. We discuss a
generalization of the notion of a leading singularity in this case -- something
we call an elliptic leading singularity -- a concept which only makes reference
to the underlying geometry of the elliptic curve. We also expand upon the task
of constructing master integrand bases that neatly distinguish between elliptic
and ordinary polylogs. This stratification of the basis -- where each master is
either pure elliptic or polylog -- is carried out by drawing on an expanded
basis at two loops, the so-called triangle power counting basis. In the course
of developing such a master integrand basis, we emphasize the importance of
choosing, intelligently, spanning sets of cuts, and writing down integrand
numerators dual to these cuts that are diagonal -- or prescriptive -- with
regard to these choices, to highlight the conceptual and technical
simplifications arising therefrom.

surface of metal oxide catalysts often acts as reaction sites, for example, in
the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, experimental evaluation of EOvac is
very challenging. We obtained the EOvac for (100), (110), and (111) surfaces of
normal zinc-based spinel oxides ZnAl2O4, ZnGa2O4, ZnIn2O4, ZnV2O4, ZnCr2O4,
ZnMn2O4, ZnFe2O4, and ZnCo2O4. The most stable surface is (100) for all
compounds. The smallest EOvac for a surface is the largest in the (100) surface
except for ZnCo2O4. For (100) and (110) surfaces, there is a good correlation,
over all spinels, between the smallest EOvac for the surface and bulk formation
energy, while the ionization potential correlates well in (111) surfaces.
Machine learning over EOvac of all surface sites in all orientations and all
compounds to find the important factors, or descriptors, that decide the EOvac
revealed that bulk and surface-dependent descriptors are the most important,
namely the bulk formation energy, a Boolean descriptor on whether the surface
is (111), and the ionization potential, followed by geometrical descriptors
that are different in each O site.

object detection, most existing works focus on LiDAR and camera fusion. In this
paper, we propose TransCAR, a Transformer-based Camera-And-Radar fusion
solution for 3D object detection. Our TransCAR consists of two modules. The
first module learns 2D features from surround-view camera images and then uses
a sparse set of 3D object queries to index into these 2D features. The
vision-updated queries then interact with each other via transformer
self-attention layer. The second module learns radar features from multiple
radar scans and then applies transformer decoder to learn the interactions
between radar features and vision-updated queries. The cross-attention layer
within the transformer decoder can adaptively learn the soft-association
between the radar features and vision-updated queries instead of
hard-association based on sensor calibration only. Finally, our model estimates
a bounding box per query using set-to-set Hungarian loss, which enables the
method to avoid non-maximum suppression. TransCAR improves the velocity
estimation using the radar scans without temporal information. The superior
experimental results of our TransCAR on the challenging nuScenes datasets
illustrate that our TransCAR outperforms state-of-the-art Camera-Radar

  Embeddings and One-Class Classification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Industrial image anomaly detection under the setting of one-class
classification has significant practical value. However, most existing models
struggle to extract separable feature representations when performing feature
embedding and struggle to build compact descriptions of normal features when
performing one-class classification. One direct consequence of this is that
most models perform poorly in detecting logical anomalies which violate
contextual relationships. Focusing on more effective and comprehensive anomaly
detection, we propose a network based on self-supervised learning and
self-attentive graph convolution (SLSG) for anomaly detection. SLSG uses a
generative pre-training network to assist the encoder in learning the embedding
of normal patterns and the reasoning of position relationships. Subsequently,
SLSG introduces the pseudo-prior knowledge of anomaly through simulated
abnormal samples. By comparing the simulated anomalies, SLSG can better
summarize the normal features and narrow down the hypersphere used for
one-class classification. In addition, with the construction of a more general
graph structure, SLSG comprehensively models the dense and sparse relationships
among elements in the image, which further strengthens the detection of logical
anomalies. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that SLSG achieves
superior anomaly detection performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
method.

against adversarial attacks in the inference phase and mitigate the side

indispensable component of many artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However,
in high-stake AI applications, it is crucial to understand AT's vulnerabilities

susceptibility to poisoning attacks, a type of malicious attack that
manipulates training data to compromise the performance of the trained model.
Previous work has focused on poisoning attacks against standard training, but
little research has been done on their effectiveness against AT. To fill this
gap, we design and test effective poisoning attacks against AT. Specifically,
we investigate and design clean-label poisoning attacks, allowing attackers to
imperceptibly modify a small fraction of training data to control the
algorithm's behavior on a specific target data point. Additionally, we propose
the clean-label untargeted attack, enabling attackers can attach tiny stickers
on training data to degrade the algorithm's performance on all test data, where
the stickers could serve as a signal against unauthorized data collection. Our
experiments demonstrate that AT can still be poisoned, highlighting the need
for caution when using vanilla AT algorithms in security-related applications.

are popular dark matter candidates. The black hole superradiance mechanism
allows for these particles to be probed using only their gravitational
interaction. In this scenario, an ultralight boson cloud may form spontaneously
around a spinning black hole and extract a non-negligible fraction of the black
hole's mass. These oscillating clouds produce quasi-monochromatic,
long-duration gravitational waves that may be detectable by ground-based or
space-based gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the capability of a new
long-duration signal tracking method, based on a hidden Markov model, to detect
gravitational wave signals generated by ultralight vector boson clouds,
including cases where the signal frequency evolution timescale is much shorter
than that of a typical continuous wave signal. We quantify the detection
horizon distances for vector boson clouds with current- and next-generation
ground-based detectors. We demonstrate that vector clouds hosted by black holes
with mass $\gtrsim 60 M_{\odot}$ and spin $\gtrsim 0.6$ are within the reach of
current-generation detectors up to a luminosity distance of $\sim 1$ Gpc. This
search method enables one to target vector boson clouds around remnant black
holes from compact binary mergers detected by gravitational-wave detectors. We
discuss the impact of the sky localization of the merger events and demonstrate
that a typical remnant black hole reasonably well-localized by the current
generation detector network is accessible in a follow-up search.

projecting direction that is used to project the two input measures to one
dimension. Due to the intractability of the expectation, Monte Carlo
integration is performed to estimate the value of the SW distance. Despite
having various variants, there has been no prior work that improves the Monte
Carlo estimation scheme for the SW distance in terms of controlling its
variance. To bridge the literature on variance reduction and the literature on
the SW distance, we propose computationally efficient control variates to
reduce the variance of the empirical estimation of the SW distance. The key
idea is to first find Gaussian approximations of projected one-dimensional
measures, then we utilize the closed-form of the Wasserstein-2 distance between
two Gaussian distributions to design the control variates. In particular, we
propose using a lower bound and an upper bound of the Wasserstein-2 distance
between two fitted Gaussians as two computationally efficient control variates.
We empirically show that the proposed control variate estimators can help to
reduce the variance considerably when comparing measures over images and
point-clouds. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of the proposed
control variate estimators in gradient flows to interpolate between two

the development of optimal tests for sequential experiments by analyzing their
asymptotic properties. Our key finding is that the asymptotic power function of
any test can be matched by a test in a limit experiment where a Gaussian
process is observed for each treatment, and inference is made for the drifts of
these processes. This result has important implications, including a powerful
sufficiency result: any candidate test only needs to rely on a fixed set of

are the number of times each treatment has been sampled by the end of the
experiment, along with final value of the score (for parametric models) or
efficient influence function (for non-parametric models) process for each

satellites is crucial. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs)
have shown superior performance in object detection when large-scale datasets
are available. However, collecting rich data of RSOs is difficult due to very
few occurrences in the space images. Without sufficient data, it is challenging
to comprehensively train DCNN detectors and make them effective for detecting
RSOs in space images, let alone to estimate whether a detector is sufficiently
robust. The lack of meaningful evaluation of different detectors could further
affect the design and application of detection methods. To tackle this issue,
we propose that the space images containing RSOs can be simulated to complement
the shortage of raw data for better benchmarking. Accordingly, we introduce a
novel simulation-augmented benchmarking framework for RSO detection (SAB-RSOD).
In our framework, by making the best use of the hardware parameters of the
sensor that captures real-world space images, we first develop a high-fidelity
RSO simulator that can generate various realistic space images. Then, we use
this simulator to generate images that contain diversified RSOs in space and
annotate them automatically. Later, we mix the synthetic images with the
real-world images, obtaining around 500 images for training with only the
real-world images for evaluation. Under SAB-RSOD, we can train different
popular object detectors like Yolo and Faster RCNN effectively, enabling us to
evaluate their performance thoroughly. The evaluation results have shown that
the amount of available data and image resolution are two key factors for
robust RSO detection. Moreover, if using a lower resolution for higher
efficiency, we demonstrated that a simple UNet-based detection method can

  Neural Network for Color Image Inpainting",,,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The use of quaternions as a novel tool for color image representation has
yielded impressive results in color image processing. By considering the color
image as a unified entity rather than separate color space components,
quaternions can effectively exploit the strong correlation among the RGB
channels, leading to enhanced performance. Especially, color image inpainting
tasks are highly beneficial from the application of quaternion matrix
completion techniques, in recent years. However, existing quaternion matrix
completion methods suffer from two major drawbacks. First, it can be difficult
to choose a regularizer that captures the common characteristics of natural
images, and sometimes the regularizer that is chosen based on empirical
evidence may not be the optimal or efficient option. Second, the optimization
process of quaternion matrix completion models is quite challenging because of
the non-commutativity of quaternion multiplication. To address the two
drawbacks of the existing quaternion matrix completion approaches mentioned
above, this paper tends to use an untrained quaternion convolutional neural
network (QCNN) to directly generate the completed quaternion matrix. This
approach replaces the explicit regularization term in the quaternion matrix
completion model with an implicit prior that is learned by the QCNN. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed method for color image inpainting compared with some existing
quaternion-based and tensor-based methods.

position of the droplet is determined and its velocity is inferred by numerical
differentiation. The edge-detected image is also used to determine the
advancing and receding contact angles of the moving drop relative to the
substrate. Motion of 2, 6, and 10 microliter water droplets for voltages in the
range of 170-270 VDC is examined to investigate the effect of drop volume and
voltage on drop deformation and velocity. Simulations have been carried out
using COMSOL Multiphysics with full coupling between the electric field and
hydrodynamics. The motion of the droplet is initiated by Young-Lippmann
spreading at the three-phase contact line, followed by a nonuniform electric
force field distributed between the active electrode and the ground wire
localized at the droplet-air interface. The solver evaluates the Maxwell's
stress tensor and introduces it as a volumetric electrostatic force in the
Navier-Stokes equations. The fully coupled numerical solution shows a good
match with experimentally determined drop movement over a silicone oil-coated
PDMS layer for which contact line friction is absent. A contact angle model
with friction leads to close agreement between simulations and drop motion over
a bare PDMS layer. Over both surfaces, continuous motion of the water droplet
is seen to be achieved in three stages, namely, initial spreading,
acceleration, and attainment of constant speed. Numerical modeling that
includes electric field-fluid flow coupling is shown to yield data in

seminal work of Tamassia (SIAM Journal on Computing 1987), a simple
combinatorial characterization of angle assignments that can be realized as
bend-free orthogonal drawings was established, thereby allowing an orthogonal
drawing to be described combinatorially by listing the angles of all corners.
The characterization reduces the need to consider certain geometric aspects,
such as edge lengths and vertex coordinates, and simplifies the task of graph
drawing algorithm design.
  Barth, Niedermann, Rutter, and Wolf (SoCG 2017) established an analogous
combinatorial characterization for ortho-radial drawings, which are a
generalization of orthogonal drawings to cylindrical grids. The proof of the
characterization is existential and does not result in an efficient algorithm.

developing quadratic-time algorithms for both testing the realizability of a

constructing such a drawing.

near-linear time. We establish a new characterization for ortho-radial drawings

formulates a computation rate maximization problem via the joint design of the

unified evaluation methodology and introduces an open-source framework called
EVREAL to comprehensively benchmark and analyze various event-based video

research on the competencies and skills required by IT professionals to develop
such systems. This study aims to identify the industrial sustainability needs
for education and training from software engineers' perspective. We conducted
interviews and focus groups with experts from twenty-eight organisations with
an IT division from nine countries to understand their interests, goals and
achievements related to sustainability, and the skills and competencies needed
to achieve their goals. Our findings show that organisations are interested in
sustainability, both idealistically and increasingly for core business reasons.
They seek to improve the sustainability of processes and products but encounter
difficulties, like the trade-off between short-term financial profitability and
long-term sustainability goals. To fill the gaps, they have promoted in-house
training courses, collaborated with universities, and sent employees to
external training. The acquired competencies make sustainability an integral
part of software development. We conclude that educational programs should
include knowledge and skills on core sustainability concepts, system thinking,
soft skills, technical sustainability, sustainability impact and measurements,
values and ethics, standards and legal aspects, and advocacy and lobbying.

asymmetries this may lead to inaccurate gravity darkening parameters. Here we
investigate the case of non-radial pulsations as possible sources of asymmetry
and likely source of misinterpreted parameters through simulations. We obtained
a series of simulated transit light curves of a hypothetical exoplanet-star
system: a host star with no gravity darkening exhibiting small amplitude
pulsations, and a typical hot Jupiter in a circular, edge-on orbit. A number of
scenarios of pulsations of various amplitudes were considered, and a proper
account of the obscuring effect of transits on all the surface intensity
components was made. The magnitude of amplitude and phase modulations of
nonradial pulsations during transits was also also investigated. We then fitted
both a non-gravity-darkened, and a gravity-darkened, free spin-orbit axis model
on the data. The Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria were used for an
objective selection of the most plausible model. We then explored the
dependence of the parameter deviations on the pulsation properties, in order to
identify configurations that can lead to falsely misaligned solutions.
Low-amplitude pulsations in general do not affect the determination of the
system parameters beyond their noise nature. However, frequencies close to
multiples of the orbital frequency are found to cause distortions leading to
solutions with a side tilted stellar rotational axis, they are therefore
preferable to clean beforehand for the sake of a correct analysis.
Additionally, for cases with higher-amplitude pulsations, it is recommended to
pre-process and clean the pulsations before analysis.

For example in forensics, the quality of the generated video summary will
affect an investigator's judgment while in journalism it might yield undesired
bias. Because of this, modeling explainability is a key concern. One of the
best ways to address the explainability challenge is to uncover the causal
relations that steer the process and lead to the result. Current machine
learning-based video summarization algorithms learn optimal parameters but do
not uncover causal relationships. Hence, they suffer from a relative lack of
explainability. In this work, a Causal Explainer, dubbed Causalainer, is
proposed to address this issue. Multiple meaningful random variables and their
joint distributions are introduced to characterize the behaviors of key
components in the problem of video summarization. In addition, helper
distributions are introduced to enhance the effectiveness of model training. In
visual-textual input scenarios, the extra input can decrease the model
performance. A causal semantics extractor is designed to tackle this issue by
effectively distilling the mutual information from the visual and textual

This study addresses the problem of detecting fake news on social media, which
poses a significant challenge to society. This study proposes a new approach
named GANM for fake news detection that employs NLP techniques to encode nodes
for news context and user content and uses three graph convolutional networks
to extract features and aggregate users' endogenous and exogenous information.
The GANM employs a unique global attention mechanism with memory to learn the

structures requires a huge amount of computational overhead for directly
simulating their mechanical problems. In this paper, a unified high-order
multi-scale method, which can effectively simulate the mechanical behavior and
predict yield strength of composite plates and shells, is developed. Firstly,
through the multiscale asymptotic analysis of multi-scale elastic equations in
the orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system, a high-order multi-scale model is
established, which can uniformly and effectively analyze the mechanical
behavior of composite plate and shell structures. Moreover, the error
estimation of the high-order multi-scale solutions is derived. Then, combining
with the material strength theory, a high-order multi-scale model for the
strength prediction of composite plate and shell structures is established.
Next, based on the established high-order multi-scale model, a multi-scale
algorithm is developed which can not only efficiently and accurately simulate
the mechanical behaviors of composite plate and shell structures, but also
predict their yield strength. Finally, the effectiveness of the established
high-order multi-scale method is verified by extensive numerical experiments.
The numerical experimental results indicate that the high-order multi-scale

composite plate and shell structures. The unified high-order multi-scale method
established in this paper is not only suitable for the prediction of mechanical

In the presence of nonlinearity, the Galerkin reduced basis approximation
remains computationally expensive due to the high complexity of evaluating the
nonlinear terms, which depends on the dimension of the truth approximation. The
empirical interpolation method (EIM) was proposed as a nonlinear model
reduction technique to render the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear terms
independent of the dimension of the truth approximation. The main idea is to
replace any nonlinear term with a reduced basis expansion expressed as a linear
combination of pre-computed basis functions and parameter-dependent
coefficients. The coefficients are determined efficiently by an inexpensive and
stable interpolation procedure. In order to improve the approximation accuracy,
we propose a first-order empirical interpolation method (FOEIM) that employs
both the nonlinear function and its partial derivatives at selected parameter

find out and pursue the best action rapidly. We explore these issues using a
model of (Bayesian) learning over a social network. Agents learn rapidly from
and may also have incentives to coordinate with others to whom they are
connected via strong links. We show, however, that when the underlying
environment changes sufficiently rapidly, any network consisting of just strong
links will do only a little better than random choice in the long run. In
contrast, networks combining strong and weak links, whereby the latter type of
links transmit information only slowly, can achieve much higher long-run

that vacuum resonances can significantly alter the emission from the poles of

atmospheres of isolated neutron stars and can result in suppression of the
continuum and the cyclotron lines. It is enhanced by magnetic Comptonization in
the hot plasma and proximity to the electron cyclotron resonance. We present
several models to illustrate the vacuum polarization effect for various

the properties of the emergent radiation by simulating polarized energy- and
angle-dependent radiative transfer. Polarization effects, including vacuum
polarization, crucially alter the emission properties. Together with strongly
angle- and energy- dependent magnetic Comptonization, they result in a complex
spectral shape, which can be described by dips and humps on top of a
power-law-like continuum with high-energy cutoff. These effects provide a
possible explanation for the common necessity of additional broad Gaussian
components and two-component Comptonization models that are used to describe
spectra of accreting X-ray pulsars. We also demonstrate the character of

irregular geometries as well as topology changes, we introduce domain agnostic
Fourier neural operator (DAFNO), a novel neural operator architecture for
learning surrogates with irregular geometries and evolving domains. The key
idea is to incorporate a smoothed characteristic function in the integral layer
architecture of FNOs, and leverage FFT to achieve rapid computations, in such a
way that the geometric information is explicitly encoded in the architecture.
In our empirical evaluation, DAFNO has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy as
compared to baseline neural operator models on two benchmark datasets of
material modeling and airfoil simulation. To further demonstrate the capability
and generalizability of DAFNO in handling complex domains with topology
changes, we consider a brittle material fracture evolution problem. With only
one training crack simulation sample, DAFNO has achieved generalizability to
unseen loading scenarios and substantially different crack patterns from the
trained scenario.

microstructure of the samples was studied by means of Scanning Electron
Microscopy, Electron Backscatter Diffraction, and Transmission Electron
Microscopy. The aging treatment leads to the formation of an ordered
face-centered cubic L12 phase named k-carbide. This study aims to characterize
the formation and growth of these k-carbides qualitatively and quantitatively
under different aging conditions. Then, an effort is made to relate the
fraction and size of this phase with the tensile properties of the steel to
determine the optimal aging conditions that will lead to a good combination of
strength and ductility. It has been found that the k-carbides start to form
intragranularly through concentration fluctuations of aluminum and manganese
inside the austenite grain. Then, with the process of spinodal decomposition,
they grow in size coherently with the matrix. During this process, the strength
and hardness of the steel increase while maintaining a relatively high
elongation. The best combination of high strength and ductility was achieved at
the aging condition of 8 h at 550 degrees Celsius with an ultimate tensile
strength up to 1157 MPa and total elongation of 51%. Increasing the aging
temperature and time, k-carbides start to form intergranularly, lose their
coherency with the matrix and severely compromise the hardness and strength.
The shearing of the carbides during deformation is also studied.

the intrinsically bright M giants observed in the NIR is an optimal option to
determine their stellar abundances. Due to uncertainties in photometric
methods, a method to determine the stellar parameters for M giants from the NIR
spectra themselves is needed.
  We have carried out new observations of 44 M giant stars (also in APOGEE
DR17) with IGRINS (R=45,000) mounted on the Gemini South telescope. We also
obtained HK band IGRINS spectra of six nearby well-studied M giants from the

determine the stellar parameters for M giants from the NIR spectra by spectral
synthesis using SME. The method is validated using the six nearby well-studied

neighbourhood M giants.
  The effective temperatures that we derive (tested for 3400$\lesssim$ Teff
$\lesssim$4000\,K) agree excellently with the six nearby M giants which
indicates that the accuracy is indeed high. For the 43 solar neighborhood M
giants, our Teff, logg, [Fe/H], $\xi_\mathrm{micro}$, [C/Fe], [N/Fe], and

leading to the generation of robust dissipative solitons in the positive
detuning regime, and of higher-order solitons in the negative detuning regime.
In order to understand the underlying mechanisms which are responsible for
these high-order states, we decompose the field on the basis of linear
eigenmodes of the system. This permits to investigate the resulting nonlinear
mode coupling processes. By increasing the external pumping, one observes the
emergence of high-order breathers and chaoticons. Our modal content analysis
reveals that breathers are dominated by modes of corresponding orders, while
chaoticons exhibit proper chaotic dynamics. We characterize the evolution of
dissipative structures by using bifurcation diagrams, and confirm their
stability by combining linear stability analysis results with numerical
simulations. Finally, we draw phase diagrams that summarize the complex

First, a data preprocessing scheme is designed according to the imaging

light field and align the microimages to the rectangular grid. Then, the global
attention module with large receptive field is proposed to capture the global
correlation among the feature maps using pixel-wise vector attention computed
in the resampling process. Also, a new image dataset consisting of 1910 focused
plenoptic images with content and depth diversity is built to benefit training

of the proposed approach. It outperforms intra coding of HEVC and VVC by an
average of 62.57% and 51.67% bitrate reduction on the 20 preprocessed focused

evolutionary strategies Lamarckian, Darwinian, and Baldwinian are implemented
and compared in an agent-based simulation. The dynamics of optimization and
learning are studied in constant as well as in dynamic environments, both as
single evolutionary strategy populations and as mixed evolutionary strategy
populations. The three different agent types are implemented as simple objects
that need to gather resources to replicate. The agent fitness is defined
through a bitstring match between the agent and the environment and to
replicate each agent needs to gather sufficient resources. To make a fair
comparison between the three different evolutionary methods, we can assume that
both the ability to learn within an individual's lifetime and the learning
process itself require additional resources compared to an evolutionary process
without lifetime learning. When all three strategies coexist and we vary the
replication costs for the different strategies we find the following general
pattern: The evolutionary advantage decreases for Lamarckian and Baldwinian
strategies as their learning costs increase and/or as their relative
replication costs increase compared to the Darwinian strategies, and in most
situations the Baldwinian strategy performs in between the Darwinian and
Lamarckian strategies. Finally, as our investigations emphasize the superiority
of the Lamarckian strategy in most cases with low learning cost, it is
interesting to note that a corresponding biological inheritance mechanism did

a local FL model and transmits the quantized model parameter to the remote
radio heads (RRHs). Each RRH receives the signals from devices over the
wireless link and forwards the signals to the server via the fronthaul link. We
rigorously develop an energy consumption model for the local training at
devices through the use of QNNs and communication models over Cloud-RAN. Based
on the proposed energy consumption model, we formulate an energy minimization
problem that optimizes the fronthaul rate allocation, user transmit power
allocation, and QNN precision levels while satisfying the limited fronthaul
capacity constraint and ensuring the convergence of the proposed FL model to a
target accuracy. To solve this problem, we analyze the convergence rate and
propose efficient algorithms based on the alternative optimization technique.
Simulation results show that the proposed FL framework can significantly reduce
energy consumption compared to other conventional approaches. We draw the
conclusion that the proposed framework holds great potential for achieving a
sustainable and environmentally-friendly FL in Cloud-RAN.

the price-competition between two reinsurers. We assume that one of the
reinsurers adopts the variance premium principle and the other adopts the

maximize their respective mean-variance cost functions which lead to a

dramatically impacting computer science education. This paper aims to explore
how well ChatGPT can perform in an introductory-level functional language
programming course. In our systematic evaluation, we treated ChatGPT as one of
our students and demonstrated that it can achieve a grade B- and its rank in
the class is 155 out of 314 students overall. Our comprehensive evaluation
provides valuable insights into ChatGPT's impact from both student and
instructor perspectives. Additionally, we identify several potential benefits
that ChatGPT can offer to both groups. Overall, we believe that this study
significantly clarifies and advances our understanding of ChatGPT's
capabilities and potential impact on computer science education.

  Behaviour","To be published in the proceedings of EAI TRIDENTCOM 2022",,,,"cs.CR cs.AI cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Since 2010, multiple cyber incidents on industrial infrastructure, such as
Stuxnet and CrashOverride, have exposed the vulnerability of Industrial Control
Systems (ICS) to cyber threats. The industrial systems are commissioned for
longer duration amounting to decades, often resulting in non-compliance to
technological advancements in industrial cybersecurity mechanisms. The
unavailability of network infrastructure information makes designing the
security policies or configuring the cybersecurity countermeasures such as
Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) challenging. An empirical solution
is to self-learn the network infrastructure information of an industrial system
from its monitored network traffic to make the network transparent for
downstream analyses tasks such as anomaly detection. In this work, a
Python-based industrial communication paradigm-aware framework, named PROFINET
Operations Enumeration and Tracking (POET), that enumerates different
industrial operations executed in a deterministic order of a PROFINET-based
industrial system is reported. The operation-driving industrial network
protocol frames are dissected for enumeration of the operations. For the
requirements of capturing the transitions between industrial operations
triggered by the communication events, the Finite State Machines (FSM) are
modelled to enumerate the PROFINET operations of the device, connection and
system. POET extracts the network information from network traffic to
instantiate appropriate FSM models (Device, Connection or System) and track the
industrial operations. It successfully detects and reports the anomalies
triggered by a network attack in a miniaturized PROFINET-based industrial
system, executed through valid network protocol exchanges and resulting in
invalid PROFINET operation transition for the device.

  Networks","15 pages, 9 figures",,,,"physics.bio-ph cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.soft physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Heterogeneous dynamics commonly emerges in anomalous diffusion with
intermittent transitions of diffusion states but proves challenging to identify
using conventional statistical methods. To capture these transient changes of
dynamics more effectively, we propose a data-driven approach and design a deep
learning model (U-AnDi) based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) for the
semantic segmentation of anomalous diffusion trajectories. This model is
developed within the framework of the 1D CNN and U-Net, incorporating a network
encoder derived from our previous work, known as WADNet. Two subtasks with
respect to the segmentation of trajectories are addressed in this work,
focusing on those with varying diffusion exponents and dynamics models,
respectively. Without requiring any prior knowledge of anomalous diffusion, our
method achieves an excellent performance for both tasks on simulated
trajectories. The validation results show a mean absolute error (MAE) of the
order of 0.01 in predicting diffusion exponents, and an mDice coefficient
approaching 1 in segmenting dynamics models. In contrast, other methods such as
recurrent neural networks or Transformers are unable to achieve similar
performance levels. In particular, our model is also examined using real-world
anomalous diffusion data: the diffusion of transmembrane proteins on cell
membrane surfaces, and the segmentation results are highly consistent with
experimental observations. Our findings could offer a heuristic deep learning
solution for the detection of heterogeneous dynamics in
single-molecule/particle tracking experiments, and have the potential to be
generalized as a universal scheme for time-series segmentation.

  Coupling",,,,,"cs.IT cs.LG eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning (DL)-based channel state information (CSI) feedback methods
compressed the CSI matrix by exploiting its delay and angle features
straightforwardly, while the measure in terms of information contained in the
CSI matrix has rarely been considered. Based on this observation, we introduce
self-information as an informative CSI representation from the perspective of
information theory, which reflects the amount of information of the original
CSI matrix in an explicit way. Then, a novel DL-based network is proposed for
temporal CSI compression in the self-information domain, namely SD-CsiNet. The
proposed SD-CsiNet projects the raw CSI onto a self-information matrix in the
newly-defined self-information domain, extracts both temporal and spatial
features of the self-information matrix, and then couples these two features
for effective compression. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the
proposed SD-CsiNet by exploiting the self-information of CSI. Particularly for
compression ratios 1/8 and 1/16, the SD-CsiNet respectively achieves 7.17 dB
and 3.68 dB performance gains compared to state-of-the-art methods.

vision excels in performance, while remaining opaque. But due to safety
regulations for safety-critical applications, like perception for automated
driving, the choice of model should also take into account how candidate models
represent semantic information for model transparency reasons. To tackle this
yet unsolved problem, our work proposes two methods for quantifying the
similarity between semantic information in CNN latent spaces. These allow
insights into both the flow and similarity of semantic information within CNN
layers, and into the degree of their similitude between different networks. As
a basis, we use renown techniques from the field of explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI), which are used to obtain global vector representations of
semantic concepts in each latent space. These are compared with respect to
their activation on test inputs. When applied to three diverse object detectors
and two datasets, our methods reveal the findings that (1) similar semantic
concepts are learned \emph{regardless of the CNN architecture}, and (2) similar
concepts emerge in similar \emph{relative} layer depth, independent of the
total number of layers. Finally, our approach poses a promising step towards
informed model selection and comprehension of how CNNs process semantic
information.

obtained from medical devices. As a consequence, there is also a need to
improve medical image resolution and analysis. Another issue in this field is
the large amount of stored medical data [16]. Human brain databases at medical
institutes, for example, can accumulate tens of Terabytes of data per year. In
this paper, we propose a novel medical image format representation based on
multiple data structures that improve the information maintained in the medical
images. The new representation keeps additional metadata information, such as
the image class or tags for the objects found in the image. We defined our own
ontology to help us classify the objects found in medical images using a
multilayer neural network. As we generally deal with large data sets, we used
the MapReduce paradigm in the Cloud environment to speed up the image
processing. To optimize the transfer between Cloud nodes and to reduce the
preprocessing time, we also propose a data compression method based on
deduplication. We test our solution for image representation and efficient data
transfer in a multisite cloud environment. Our proposed solution optimizes the
data transfer with a time improvement of 27% on average.

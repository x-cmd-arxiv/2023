are partitioned into mutually exclusive groups to maximize their social
welfare. In this work, we propose QuACS, a novel hybrid quantum classical
algorithm for Coalition Structure Generation in Induced Subgraph Games (ISGs).
Starting from a coalition structure where all the agents belong to a single
coalition, QuACS recursively identifies the optimal partition into two disjoint
subsets. This problem is reformulated as a QUBO and then solved using QAOA.
Given an $n$-agent ISG, we show that the proposed algorithm outperforms
existing approximate classical solvers with a runtime of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ and
an expected approximation ratio of $92\%$. Furthermore, it requires a
significantly lower number of qubits and allows experiments on medium-sized
problems compared to existing quantum solutions. To show the effectiveness of
QuACS we perform experiments on standard benchmark datasets using quantum
simulation.

model-free or model-based learning methods that would make one obsolete
relative to the other. In most cases, the used technique is heavily dependent
on the use case scenario or other attributes, e.g. the environment. Both
approaches have their own advantages, for example, sample efficiency or
computational efficiency. However, when combining the two, the advantages of
each can be combined and hence achieve better performance. The TD-MPC framework
is an example of this approach. On the one hand, a world model in combination
with model predictive control is used to get a good initial estimate of the
value function. On the other hand, a Q function is used to provide a good
long-term estimate. Similar to algorithms like MuZero a latent state
representation is used, where only task-relevant information is encoded to
reduce the complexity. In this paper, we propose the use of a reconstruction
function within the TD-MPC framework, so that the agent can reconstruct the
original observation given the internal state representation. This allows our
agent to have a more stable learning signal during training and also improves
sample efficiency. Our proposed addition of another loss term leads to improved
performance on both state- and image-based tasks from the DeepMind-Control
suite.

downstream tasks like object classification. However, these tasks often require
{full fine-tuning} of models and lead to storage-intensive procedures, thus
limiting the real applications of pre-trained models. Inspired by the great
success of visual prompt tuning (VPT) in vision, we attempt to explore prompt
tuning, which serves as an efficient alternative to full fine-tuning for
large-scale models, to point cloud pre-trained models to reduce storage costs.
However, it is non-trivial to apply the traditional static VPT to point clouds,
owing to the distribution diversity of point cloud data. For instance, the
scanned point clouds exhibit various types of missing or noisy points. To
address this issue, we propose an Instance-aware Dynamic Prompt Tuning (IDPT)
for point cloud pre-trained models, which utilizes a prompt module to perceive
the semantic prior features of each instance. This semantic prior facilitates
the learning of unique prompts for each instance, thus enabling downstream
tasks to robustly adapt to pre-trained point cloud models. Notably, extensive
experiments conducted on downstream tasks demonstrate that IDPT outperforms
full fine-tuning in most tasks with a mere 7\% of the trainable parameters,
thus significantly reducing the storage pressure. Code is available at

Here, we show that $j=3/2$ electrons in spin-orbit coupled materials on
honeycomb lattice can give rise to SU(8) symmetric Dirac semimetals with
symmetry implementation very different from that of graphene. This non-trivial
embedding of the microscopic symmetries in the low energy is reflected in the
nature of phases proximate to the Dirac semimetal. Such phases can arise from
finite short-range electron-electron interactions. In particular, we identify
24 such phases - divided into three classes - and their low energy properties
obtained by condensing particle-number conserving fermion bilinears that break
very different microscopic symmetries and/or are topologically protected by
symmetries. The latter includes interesting generalisations of quantum
spin-Hall phases. Remarkably some of the resultant phases still support a
sub-set of gapless fermions - protected by a sub-group of SU(8) - resulting in
interesting density wave semimetals. Near the phase transitions to such density
wave semimetals, the surviving gapless fermions strongly interact with the
bosonic order parameter field and give rise to novel quantum critical points.
Our study is applicable to a wide class of $d^1$ and $d^3$ transition metals
with strong spin-orbit coupling and predicts that such materials can harbour a
very rich interplay of symmetries and competing interactions in the
intermediate correlation regime.

The signal of interest is the impulse response of an ARMA (auto-regressive

which is fed white Gaussian noise. For this extended problem setup, which can
prompt novel behaviour, we propose a comprehensive solution. First, we extend
the well-known running consensus detector (RCD) to this correlated setup; then,
we design an efficient implementation of the RCD by exploiting the underlying
ARMA structures; and, finally, we derive the theoretical asymptotic performance
of the RCD in this ARMA setup. It turns out that the error probability at each
agent exhibits one of two regimes: either (a) the error probability decays
exponentially fast to zero or (b) it converges to a strictly positive error
floor. While regime (a) spans staple results in large deviation theory, regime
(b) is new in distributed detection and is elicited by the ARMA setup. We fully
characterize these two scenarios: we give necessary and sufficient conditions,
phrased in terms of the zero and poles of the underlying ARMA models, for the
emergence of each regime, and provide closed-form expressions for both the
decay rates of regime (a) and the positive error floors of regime (b). Our
analysis also shows that the ARMA setup leads to two novel features: (1) the
threshold level used in RCD can influence the asymptotics of the error
probabilities and (2) some agents might be weakly informative, in the sense
that their observations do not improve the asymptotic performance of RCD and,
as such, can be safely muted to save sensing resources. Numerical simulations
illustrate and confirm the theoretical findings.

Extracting robust feature representation is one of the key challenges in this

on small discriminative regions while ignoring the global perspective. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a pure transformer-based multi-task PAR
network named PARFormer, which includes four modules. In the feature extraction
module, we build a transformer-based strong baseline for feature extraction,
which achieves competitive results on several PAR benchmarks compared with the
existing CNN-based baseline methods. In the feature processing module, we
propose an effective data augmentation strategy named batch random mask (BRM)
block to reinforce the attentive feature learning of random patches.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-attribute center loss (MACL) to enhance the
inter-attribute discriminability in the feature representations. In the
viewpoint perception module, we explore the impact of viewpoints on pedestrian
attributes, and propose a multi-view contrastive loss (MCVL) that enables the
network to exploit the viewpoint information. In the attribute recognition
module, we alleviate the negative-positive imbalance problem to generate the
attribute predictions. The above modules interact and jointly learn a highly
discriminative feature space, and supervise the generation of the final
features. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed PARFormer

four community detection algorithms, Infomap, Label Propagation, Leiden, and
Louvain, and demonstrate the results in community similarity metrics. The
experiments on synthetic networks show that communities are more robust when
the initial partition is stronger or the edge addition is random, and the
experiments on empirical data also indicate that robustness performance can be
affected by the community similarity metric. Overall, our results suggest that
the communities identified by the different types of community detection
algorithms exhibit different levels of robustness, and so the robustness of

be formed from collision with another galaxy. Several star forming complexes
and tidal dwarf galaxies are distributed along the collisional ring which are
sites of star formation in environments where extreme dynamical effects are
involved. Dynamical effects can affect the star formation properties and the
spatial distribution of star forming complexes along the tidal features. To
study and quantify the star formation activity in the main body and in the ring
structure of the NGC 5291 system, we use high spatial resolution FUV and NUV
imaging observations from the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope onboard AstroSat. A
total of 57 star-forming knots are identified to be part of this interacting
system out of which 12 are new detections (star forming complexes that lie
inside the HI contour) compared to the previous measurements from lower
resolution UV imaging. We estimate the attenuation in UV for each of the
resolved star-forming knots using the UV spectral slope $\beta$, derived from
the FUV-NUV colour. Using the extinction corrected UV fluxes, we derive the
star formation rate of the resolved star forming complexes. The extinction
corrected total star formation rate of this system is estimated as 1.75 $\pm$
0.04 $M_{\odot}/yr$. The comparison with dwarf galaxy populations (BCD, Sm and
dIm galaxies) in the nearby Universe shows that many of the knots in the NGC
5291 system have SFR values comparable to the SFR of BCD galaxies.

robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and the transportation of goods in
warehouses. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the localization
using monocular visual cameras. While structure from motion (SfM) predicts the
absolute pose from a point cloud, absolute pose regression (APR) methods learn
a semantic understanding of the environment through neural networks. However,
both fields face challenges caused by the environment such as motion blur,
lighting changes, repetitive patterns, and feature-less structures. This study
aims to address these challenges by incorporating additional information and
regularizing the absolute pose using relative pose regression (RPR) methods.
The optical flow between consecutive images is computed using the Lucas-Kanade
algorithm, and the relative pose is predicted using an auxiliary small
recurrent convolutional network. The fusion of absolute and relative poses is a
complex task due to the mismatch between the global and local coordinate
systems. State-of-the-art methods fusing absolute and relative poses use pose
graph optimization (PGO) to regularize the absolute pose predictions using
relative poses. In this work, we propose recurrent fusion networks to optimally
align absolute and relative pose predictions to improve the absolute pose
prediction. We evaluate eight different recurrent units and construct a
simulation environment to pre-train the APR and RPR networks for better
generalized training. Additionally, we record a large database of different
scenarios in a challenging large-scale indoor environment that mimics a
warehouse with transportation robots. We conduct hyperparameter searches and
experiments to show the effectiveness of our recurrent fusion method compared
to PGO.

introduction of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Object detection is a
multi-task learning problem where both the position of the objects in the
images as well as their classes needs to be correctly identified. The idea here
is to maximize the overlap between the ground-truth bounding boxes and the
predictions i.e. the Intersection over Union (IoU). In the scope of work seen
currently in this domain, IoU is approximated by using the Huber loss as a
proxy but this indirect method does not leverage the IoU information and treats
the bounding box as four independent, unrelated terms of regression. This is
not true for a bounding box where the four coordinates are highly correlated
and hold a semantic meaning when taken together. The direct optimization of the
IoU is not possible due to its non-convex and non-differentiable nature. In
this paper, we have formulated a novel loss namely, the Smooth IoU, which
directly optimizes the IoUs for the bounding boxes. This loss has been
evaluated on the Oxford IIIT Pets, Udacity self-driving car, PASCAL VOC, and
VWFS Car Damage datasets and has shown performance gains over the standard

there are many valid responses for a given context. However, only some of these
responses will be desirable in our downstream task. This raises the question of
how we should train the model such that it can emulate the desirable

one-to-one setup--only a single target response is given for a single dialogue

ignoring the full range of possible responses. Using text-based games as a
testbed, our approach, PASA, uses discrete latent variables to capture the
range of different behaviours represented in our larger pre-training dataset.
We then use knowledge distillation to distil the posterior probability
distribution into a student model. This probability distribution is far richer
than learning from only the hard targets of the dataset, and thus allows the
student model to benefit from the richer range of actions the teacher model has
learned. Results show up to 49% empirical improvement over the previous

paper, it is determined that the domain invariant features could be contained
in the single source domain training samples, then the task is to find proper
ways to extract such domain invariant features from the single source domain
samples. An assumption is made that the domain invariant features are closely
related to the frequency. Then, a new method that learns through multiple
frequency domains is proposed. The key idea is, dividing the frequency domain
of each original image into multiple subdomains, and learning features in the
subdomain by a designed two branches network. In this way, the model is
enforced to learn features from more samples of the specifically limited

range of temperature measured during the study was within 1.50C. The
off-resonance maps acquired before and after the 3D TSE showed similar hotspots
and changed mainly by a global constant. The SNR measurements were highly
repeatable across sessions and over the ten days, quantified by a CV of 4.9%.
The magnetic field inhomogeneity effects quantified by eccentricity showed a CV
of 13.7% but less than 5.1% in two of the three sessions over ten days. The use
of conjugate phase reconstruction mitigated geometrical distortion artifacts.
The repeatability of image uniformity was moderate at 10.6%, with two of three
sessions resulting in a CV of less than 7.8%. Temperature and humidity did not
significantly affect SNR and mean frequency drift within the ranges of these
environmental factors investigated. We found that humidity and temperature in
the range investigated did not impact SNR and frequency. Our findings indicate
high repeatability for SNR and magnetic field homogeneity; and moderate
repeatability for image uniformity.

facilitate the resolution of challenging and large-scale mathematical
optimization problems has recently become an avenue of prolific and promising
research. In this paper, we propose a novel learning procedure to assist in the
solution of a well-known computationally difficult optimization problem in
power systems: The Direct Current Optimal Transmission Switching (DC-OTS). This
model consists in finding the configuration of the power network that results
in the cheapest dispatch of the power generating units. For this, the model
includes a set of binaries that determine the on/off status of the switchable
transmission lines. Therefore, the DC-OTS problem takes the form of a
mixed-integer program, which is NP-hard in general. Its solution has been
approached by way of exact and heuristic methods. The former employ techniques
from mixed-integer programming to solve the problem to certified global
optimality, while the latter seek to identify good solutions quickly. While the
heuristic methods tend to be comparatively much faster, they may suggest
suboptimal or even infeasible networks topologies. The proposed approach in
this paper leverages known solutions to past instances of the DC-OTS problem to
speed up the mixed-integer optimization of a new unseen model. Although it does
not offer optimality guarantees, a series of numerical experiments run on a
real-life power system dataset show that it features a very high success rate
in identifying the optimal grid topology (especially when compared to
alternative competing heuristics), while rendering remarkable speed-up factors.

perturbing mass comprises two distinct contributions. Most famously, the system
will respond by forming a polarization `wake' around the perturber. At the same
time, the perturber may also excite one or more `normal modes', i.e. coherent
oscillations of the entire stellar system which are either stable or unstable
depending on the system parameters. The amplitude of the first (wake)

this paper we consider the linear response of a homogeneous stellar system to a

divergence of the wake response is in fact cancelled by a corresponding
divergence in the normal mode response, rendering the total response finite. We
demonstrate this cancellation explicitly for a box of stars with Maxwellian

two classification tasks: firstly, identifying patients who require further

on the degree of stenosis, according to commonly used CAD-RADS thresholds. The
pipeline pre-processes multiplanar projections of the coronary arteries,
extracted from the original CCTAs, and classifies them using a fine-tuned
Multi-Axis Vision Transformer architecture. With the aim of emulating the
current clinical practice, the model is trained to assign a per-patient score
by stacking the bi-dimensional longitudinal cross-sections of the three main
coronary arteries along channel dimension. Furthermore, it generates visually
interpretable maps to assess the reliability of the predictions. When run on a
database of 1873 three-channel images of 253 patients collected at the Monzino
Cardiology Center in Milan, the pipeline obtained an AUC of 0.87 and 0.93 for

Papaloizou-Pringle Instability (PPI). PPI-saturated accretion tori have been
shown to produce gravitational waves, detectable to cosmological distances by
third-generation gravitational wave (GW) observatories. While the PPI operates
strongly for purely hydrodynamic disks, the situation can be different for
disks hosting initially small magnetic fields. Evolutions of disks without
self-gravity in fixed BH spacetimes have shown that small seed fields can
initiate the rapid growth of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), which
then strongly suppresses the PPI. Since realistic astrophysical disks are
expected to be magnetized, PPI-generated GW signals may be suppressed as well.
However, it is unclear what happens when the disk self-gravity is restored.
Here, we study the impact of magnetic fields on the PPI-saturated state of a
self-gravitating accretion disk around a spinning BH ($\chi = 0.7$) aligned
with the disk angular momentum, as well as one around a non-spinning BH. We
find the MRI is effective at reducing the amplitude of PPI modes and their
associated GWs, but the systems still generate GWs. Estimating the
detectability of these systems accross a wide range of masses, we show that
magnetic fields reduce the maximum detection distance by Cosmic Explorer from
300Mpc (in the pure hydrodynamic case) to 45Mpc for a $10 M_{\odot}$ system, by
LISA from 11500Mpc to 2700Mpc for a $2 \times 10^{5} M_{\odot}$ system, and by

we first quantify the non-Gaussianity of the CIB, revealing additional detail
on top of its well-measured power spectrum. To achieve this, we use
needlet-like multipole-band-filters to calculate the variance and higher-point
correlations. We show the 3-point and 4-point spectra, and compare our
calculated bispectra to Planck values. We then lens the CIB, shell-by-shell
with corresponding convergence maps, to capture the broad redshift extent of
both the CIB and its lensing convergence. Using our simulations, we show that
the lensed CIB power spectrum and bispectrum agree with observations: the
lensing of the CIB changes the 3-point and 4-point functions by a few tens of
percent at large scales, unlike with the power spectrum, which changes by less
than two percent. We expand our analyses to encompass the full intensity
probability distribution functions (PDFs) involving all n-point correlations as
a function of scale. In particular we use the relative entropy between lensed
and unlensed PDFs to create a spectrum of templates that can allow estimation
of lensing. The underlying CIB model has uncertainties, in particular missing
the important role of star-bursting, which has a larger effect on higher point
correlations than on the variance. We test this by adding a stochastic
log-normal term to the intensity distributions. The novel aspects of our

applications, but for any radiant background, including line intensity maps.

prompt emission mechanism is still not well understood. Theoretical modeling of
the prompt emission has advanced considerably due to new computational tools
and techniques. One such tool is the PLUTO hydrodynamics code, which is used to
numerically simulate GRB outflows. PLUTO uses Adaptive Mesh Refinement to focus
computational efforts on the portion of the grid that contains the simulated
jet. Another tool is the Monte Carlo Radiation Transfer (MCRaT) code, which
predicts electromagnetic signatures of GRBs by conducting photon scatterings
within a jet using PLUTO. The effects of the underlying resolution of a PLUTO
simulation with respect to MCRaT post-processing radiative transfer results
have not yet been quantified. We analyze an analytic spherical outflow and a
hydrodynamically simulated GRB jet with MCRaT at varying spatial and temporal
resolutions and quantify how decreasing both resolutions affect the resulting
mock observations. We find that changing the spatial resolution changes the
hydrodynamic properties of the jet, which directly affect the MCRaT mock
observable peak energies. We also find that decreasing the temporal resolution
artificially decreases the high energy slope of the mock observed spectrum,
which increases both the spectral peak energy and the luminosity. We show that
the effects are additive when both spatial and temporal resolutions are
modified. Our results allow us to understand how decreased hydrodynamic
temporal and spatial resolutions affect the results of post-processing
radiative transfer calculations, allowing for the optimization of hydrodynamic
simulations for radiative transfer codes.

with the logistic loss applied to the outputs of a neural network, when the
softmax is used. But, what guarantees can we rely on when using cross-entropy
as a surrogate loss? We present a theoretical analysis of a broad family of
losses, comp-sum losses, that includes cross-entropy (or logistic loss),
generalized cross-entropy, the mean absolute error and other loss
cross-entropy-like functions. We give the first $H$-consistency bounds for
these loss functions. These are non-asymptotic guarantees that upper bound the
zero-one loss estimation error in terms of the estimation error of a surrogate
loss, for the specific hypothesis set $H$ used. We further show that our bounds
are tight. These bounds depend on quantities called minimizability gaps, which
only depend on the loss function and the hypothesis set. To make them more
explicit, we give a specific analysis of these gaps for comp-sum losses. We
also introduce a new family of loss functions, smooth adversarial comp-sum
losses, derived from their comp-sum counterparts by adding in a related smooth
term. We show that these loss functions are beneficial in the adversarial
setting by proving that they admit $H$-consistency bounds. This leads to new
adversarial robustness algorithms that consist of minimizing a regularized
smooth adversarial comp-sum loss. While our main purpose is a theoretical
analysis, we also present an extensive empirical analysis comparing comp-sum
losses. We further report the results of a series of experiments demonstrating
that our adversarial robustness algorithms outperform the current

several theoretical studies hint at the existence of a subdominant proton
component up to the highest energies. Motivated by the exciting prospect of
performing charged-particle astronomy with ultra-high-energy (UHE) protons we
quantify the level of UHE-proton flux that is compatible with present
multimessenger observations and the associated fluxes of neutral messengers
produced in the interactions of the protons. We study this scenario with
numerical simulations of two independent populations of extragalactic sources
and perform a fit to the combined UHECR energy spectrum and composition
observables, constrained by diffuse gamma-ray and neutrino observations. We
find that up to of order $10\%$ of the cosmic rays at the highest energies can

interaction model for the air showers. Depending on the maximum proton energy
($E_\text{max}^\text{p}$) and the redshift evolution of sources, the associated
flux of cosmogenic neutrinos and UHE gamma rays can significantly exceed the
multimessenger signal of the mixed-mass cosmic rays. Moreover, if

acceleration scale of MOND. Such experiments test the degree of generality of
these anomalies, by exploring the same acceleration regime using independent
astronomical systems of vastly smaller mass and size. A signal above Newtonian
expectations has been observed when $a<a_{0}$, alternatively interpreted as
evidence of a modification in the relevant fundamental physics, or as being due
to kinematic contaminants affecting the experiment; the presence of undetected
stellar components, unbound encounters and spurious projection effects. Here I
take advantage of the enhanced DR3 {\it Gaia} catalogue to perform a more

contributes negligible light -- suggest that the companions are compact
objects. From the likely BH/NS candidates identified in recent work
accompanying Gaia DR3, we select 14 of the most promising targets for
follow-up. We obtained spectra for each object at 2-10 epochs, strategically
observing near conjunction to best-constrain the radial velocity
semi-amplitude. From the measured semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity
curves, we derive minimum companion masses of $M_{2,\min} \leq 0.5 ~ M_{\odot}$
in all cases. Assuming random inclinations, the typical inferred companion mass
is $M_2 \sim 0.15 ~ M_{\odot}$. This makes it unlikely that any of these

observed variability. We can best reproduce the observed light curves and
radial velocities with models for unequal-mass contact binaries with starspots.
Some of the objects in our sample may also be detached main-sequence binaries,

to the Wilson coefficient of the semileptonic $\mathcal{O}_{9\ell}$ operators

clearly reinforced. We also discuss the possibility of a long-distance
charm-loop contribution through a mode-by-mode analysis and we find that the

significant evidence of a non-constant $q^2$ dependencies, which would indicate
the presence of a long-distance charm-loop contribution.

ChatGPT was asked to answer the questions posed by the political compass test
as well as similar questionnaires that are specific to the respective politics
of the G7 member states. These eight tests were repeated ten times each and
revealed that ChatGPT seems to hold a bias towards progressive views. The
political compass test revealed a bias towards progressive and libertarian
views, with the average coordinates on the political compass being (-6.48,
-5.99) (with (0, 0) the center of the compass, i.e., centrism and the axes
ranging from -10 to 10), supporting the claims of prior research. The political
questionnaires for the G7 member states indicated a bias towards progressive
views but no significant bias between authoritarian and libertarian views,
contradicting the findings of prior reports, with the average coordinates being
(-3.27, 0.58). In addition, ChatGPT's Big Five personality traits were tested
using the OCEAN test and its personality type was queried using the
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test. Finally, the maliciousness of ChatGPT
was evaluated using the Dark Factor test. These three tests were also repeated
ten times each, revealing that ChatGPT perceives itself as highly open and
agreeable, has the Myers-Briggs personality type ENFJ, and is among the 15% of

enables the multi-level caching and multi-threading capabilities of modern

embedding matrix to increase data locality and reduce cache misses (thus
reduces read latency); (2) It optimizes stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with
sampling by parallelizing vector products instead of matrix-matrix
multiplications, in particular the similarity computation therein, to avoid
memory copies for matrix data preparation; and (3) It aggressively reuses
intermediate results from the forward phase in the backward phase to alleviate
redundant computation. Evaluation on five widely used datasets with both x86-

highly efficient LZSS compression on modern GPUs for multi-byte data. The
contribution of our work is fourfold: First, we perform an in-depth analysis of

prefix sum from one pass to two passes and fuse multiple kernels to reduce data
movement between shared memory and global memory, and (2) optimize existing
pattern-matching approach for multi-byte symbols to reduce computation
complexity and explore longer repeated patterns. Third, we perform

utilization by adapting data partitions to different GPU architectures.

the Zeeman effect on the (polarized) radiative transfer of emission from
paramagnetic molecules excited in protoplanetary disks. While the effects of
the Zeeman effect are commonly studied in the circular polarization of spectral
lines, we perform a comprehensive modeling also of the Zeeman-induced
broadening of spectral lines and their linear polarization. We develop
simplified radiative transfer models adapted to protoplanetary disks, which we
compare to full three-dimensional polarized radiative transfer simulations. We
find that the radiative transfer of circular polarization is heavily affected
by the expected polarity-change of the magnetic field between opposite sides of
the disk. In contrast, Zeeman broadening and linear polarization are relatively
unaffected by this sign change due to their quadratic dependence on the
magnetic field. We can match our simplified radiative transfer models to full
polarization modeling with high fidelity, which in turn allows us to prescribe
straight-forward methods to extract magnetic field information from Zeeman
broadening and linear polarization observations. We find that Zeeman broadening
and linear polarization observations are highly advantageous methods to
characterize protoplanetary disk magnetic fields as they are both sensitive
probes of the magnetic field and are marginally affected by any sign change of

The programmer specifies type information for each remote procedure, and a

the flow of RPCs between services, leading many installations to use sidecars
or service mesh proxies for manageability and policy flexibility. These
sidecars typically involve inspection and modification of RPC data that the
stub compiler had just carefully assembled, adding needless overhead. Further,
upgrading diverse application RPC stubs to use advanced hardware capabilities
such as RDMA or DPDK is a long and involved process, and often incompatible
with sidecar policy control.
  In this paper, we propose, implement, and evaluate a novel approach, where

engines and arbitrates resource use, and then marshals data customized to the

diagrams (GFD) to compute color-dressed generalized biadjoint amplitudes. In
this work we study the Cachazo-Early-Guevara-Mizera (CEGM) representation of
generalized partial amplitudes and ``decoupling"" identities. This
representation is a generalization of the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formulation as
an integral over the configuration space $X(k,n)$ of $n$ points on
$\mathbb{CP}^{k-1}$ in generic position.
  Unlike the $k=2$ case, Parke-Taylor-like integrands are not enough to compute
all partial amplitudes for $k>2$. Here we give a set of constraints that
integrands associated to GCOs must satisfy and use them to construct all
$(3,n<9)$ integrands, all $(3,9)$ integrands up to four undetermined constants,
and $95 \%$ of $(4,8)$ integrands up to 24 undetermined constants.
  $k=2$ partial amplitudes are known to satisfy identities. Among them, the
so-called $U(1)$ decoupling identities are the simplest ones. These are
characterized by a label $i$ and a color ordering in $X(2,|[n]\setminus
\{i\}|)$. Here we introduce decoupling identities for $k>2$ determined
combinatorially using GCOs. Moreover, we identify the natural analog of $U(1)$
identities as those characterized by a pair of labels $i\neq j$, and a pair of
GCOs, one in $X(k,|[n]\setminus \{i\}|)$ and the other in $X(k-1,|[n]\setminus
\{j\}|)$. We call them {\it double extension} identities.
  We also provide explicit connections among different ways of representing
GCOs, such as configurations of lines, configurations of points, and
reorientation classes of uniform oriented matroids (chirotopes).

these atomic signatures can directly trace the escaping atmosphere and
constrain the energy balance of the upper atmosphere. To understand these

a one-dimensional model of the upper atmosphere and hydrodynamic escape to
include important processes of atomic metal species. The hydrodynamic model is
coupled to a Ly$\alpha$ Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculation to simulate
the excited hydrogen population and associated heating/ionization effects.
Using this model, we interpret the detected atomic features in the transmission
spectrum of WASP-121b and explore the impact of metals and excited hydrogen on
its upper atmosphere. We demonstrate the use of multiple absorption lines to
impose stronger constraints on the properties of the upper atmosphere than the
analysis of a single transmission feature can provide. In addition, the model
shows that line broadening due to atmospheric outflow driven by the Roche lobe
overflow is necessary to explain the observed line widths and highlights the
importance of the high mass-loss rate caused by the Roche lobe overflow that
requires careful consideration of the structure of the lower and middle
atmosphere. We also show that metal species and excited state hydrogen can play
an important role in the thermal and ionization balance of ultra-hot Jupiter

paramount importance. Typically, a cyberattack in ICS aims to impose physical
damage on the ICSs by exploiting a sequence of vulnerabilities that leads to
compromising the system's sensors and/or controllers. Due to the physics of the
ICSs operation, maliciously accessing different sensors or components may cause
varying levels of risk. Therefore, identifying cyberattacks with the highest
risks is essential for effectively designing detection schemes and mitigation
strategies. In this paper, we develop an optimization-based holistic
cybersecurity risk assessment framework by integrating the cyber and physical
systems of ICSs to understand 1) the vulnerabilities of the ICS network with
holistic consideration of cyber and physical components and their interactions,
and 2) the attack strategies that can lead to significant physical damage to
the critical assets in ICS. We formulate a novel optimization problem that
accounts for the attacker's objective and limitation in both the physical and

masses already at high redshifts. Observations of high-redshift SMBH
progenitors or lower-mass AGN will thus help characterize the evolution of
SMBHs and their impact on the surroundings. With the launch of the JWST,
fainter objects at high redshifts can now be detected, including lower-mass
AGN. We assess the observability of such low luminosity AGN, using the
cosmological simulation code GIZMO to provide a realistic environment for black
hole growth in the early Universe. Soon after the first stars are born in the
simulation run, we insert stellar-remnant black hole seeds of various initial
masses, between $300$ and $10^4 {\rm \ M}_{\odot}$, at the center of a dark
matter halo and follow their growth until $z\sim6$. Such stellar black hole
seeds placed in a typical high-$z$ environment do not significantly accrete and
grow to reach masses that can be observed with the JWST under conditions of
standard Bondi-Hoyle accretion, as energy input from stellar feedback and
chaotic dynamics prevent efficient gas accretion onto the black holes. To be
observed with the JWST, rarer but still physically feasible growth regimes,
involving Eddington or super-Eddington accretion, would be required.
Alternatively, AGN observability may be boosted under even rarer conditions of
extreme gravitational lensing.

inclined debris disks imaged at visible wavelengths, the cold disk around HD
53143 appears as disconnected ""arcs"" of material, with no forward scattering
side detected to date. We present new, deeper Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) coronagraphic observations of the
HD 53143 debris disk and show that the forward scattering side of the disk
remains undetected. By fitting our KLIP-reduced observations via forward
modeling with an optically thin disk model, we show that fitting the visible
wavelength images with an azimuthally symmetric disk with unconstrained
orientation results in an unphysical edge-on orientation that is at odds with
recent ALMA observations, while constraining the orientation to that observed
by ALMA results in nearly isotropically scattering dust. We show that the
HD53143 host star exhibits significant stellar variations due to spot rotation
and revisit age estimates for this system.

to the formation of a localized normal mode. For lower values of the

with time) when the frequency of the external force coincides with the
frequency of the localized mode. An unusual resonance (``quasi-resonance"")
occurs for the oscillator with the critical value of the natural frequency
$\omega=\omega_c$, which separates thermalizing (ergodic) and non-thermalizing

  Adaptation in Long-tail Semantic Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The research in self-supervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation
has recently received considerable attention. Although GAN-based methods have
become one of the most popular approaches to domain adaptation, they have
suffered from some limitations. They are insufficient to model both global and
local structures of a given image, especially in small regions of tail classes.
Moreover, they perform bad on the tail classes containing limited number of
pixels or less training samples. In order to address these issues, we present a
new self-supervised domain adaptation approach to tackle long-tail semantic
segmentation in this paper. Firstly, a new metric is introduced to formulate
long-tail domain adaptation in the segmentation problem. Secondly, a new
Conditional Maximum Likelihood (CoMaL) approach in an autoregressive framework
is presented to solve the problem of long-tail domain adaptation. Although
other segmentation methods work under the pixel independence assumption, the
long-tailed pixel distributions in CoMaL are generally solved in the context of
structural dependency, as that is more realistic. Finally, the proposed method
is evaluated on popular large-scale semantic segmentation benchmarks, i.e.,
""SYNTHIA to Cityscapes"" and ""GTA to Cityscapes"", and outperforms the prior
methods by a large margin in both the standard and the proposed evaluation
protocols.

cross-domain food image-to-recipe retrieval, i.e., source data selector and
weighted cross-modal adversarial learning. The former aims to select source
samples similar to the target data and filter out distinctive ones for

more similar to the target data and lower weights to suppress the distinctive
ones for both cross-modal and adversarial learning. The weights are computed
from the recipe features extracted from a pre-trained source model. Experiments

methodology to generate bid prices using historical booking data only. Our
approach is an ex-post greedy heuristic to estimate proxies for marginal
opportunity costs as a function of remaining capacity and time-to-departure
solely based on historical booking data. We utilize a neural network algorithm
to project bid price estimations into the future. We conduct an extensive
simulation study where we measure performance of our methodology compared to
that of an optimally generated bid price using dynamic programming (DP). We
also extend our simulations to measure performance of both data-driven and DP
generated bid prices under the presence of demand misspecification. Our results
show that our data-driven methodology stays near a theoretical optimum (<1%
revenue gap) for a wide-range of settings, whereas DP deviates more
significantly from the optimal as the magnitude of misspecification is
increased. This highlights the robustness of our data-driven approach.

physicians in determining eligibility for clinical trials based on a patient's
summarised medical profile. Using a prompting strategy combining one-shot,
selection-inference and chain-of-thought techniques, we investigate the
performance of LLMs on 10 synthetically created patient profiles. Performance
is evaluated at four levels: ability to identify screenable eligibility
criteria from a trial given a medical profile; ability to classify for each
individual criterion whether the patient qualifies; the overall classification
whether a patient is eligible for a clinical trial and the percentage of
criteria to be screened by physician. We evaluated against 146 clinical trials
and a total of 4,135 eligibility criteria. The LLM was able to correctly
identify the screenability of 72% (2,994/4,135) of the criteria. Additionally,
72% (341/471) of the screenable criteria were evaluated correctly. The
resulting trial level classification as eligible or ineligible resulted in a
recall of 0.5. By leveraging LLMs with a physician-in-the-loop, a recall of 1.0
and precision of 0.71 on clinical trial level can be achieved while reducing
the amount of criteria to be checked by an estimated 90%. LLMs can be used to
assist physicians with pre-screening of patients for clinical trials. By
forcing instruction-tuned LLMs to produce chain-of-thought responses, the
reasoning can be made transparent to and the decision process becomes amenable
by physicians, thereby making such a system feasible for use in real-world

measured masses $M_1 =2.64 \pm 0.07 M_\odot$ and $M_2 =2.10 \pm 0.03 M_\odot$.
Interferometry also allows us to resolve the giant, and measure its size as

in fully dynamic graphs in subquadratic time. However, these dynamic algebraic
algorithms generally cannot maintain the shortest paths, especially against
adaptive adversaries. We present the first fully dynamic algorithm that
maintains the shortest paths against an adaptive adversary in subquadratic
update time. This is obtained via a combinatorial reduction that allows
reconstructing the shortest paths with only a few distance estimates. Using
this reduction, we obtain the following:
  On weighted directed graphs with real edge weights in $[1,W]$, we can
maintain $(1+\epsilon)$ approximate shortest paths in
$\tilde{O}(n^{1.816}\epsilon^{-2} \log W)$ update and $\tilde{O}(n^{1.741}
\epsilon^{-2} \log W)$ query time. This improves upon the approximate distance
data structures from [v.d.Brand, Nanongkai, FOCS'19], which only returned a
distance estimate, by matching their complexity and returning an approximate
shortest path.
  On unweighted directed graphs, we can maintain exact shortest paths in
$\tilde{O}(n^{1.823})$ update and $\tilde{O}(n^{1.747})$ query time. This
improves upon [Bergamaschi, Henzinger, P.Gutenberg, V.Williams, Wein, SODA'21]
who could report the path only against oblivious adversaries. We improve both
their update and query time while also handling adaptive adversaries.
  On unweighted undirected graphs, our reduction holds not just against
adaptive adversaries but is also deterministic. We maintain a
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate $st$-shortest path in $O(n^{1.529} / \epsilon^2)$
time per update, and $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate single source shortest paths in

and sustainable transportation, in this paper we study a scenario of repeated
principal-agent games within a multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework, where: the
principal gives a different incentive for each bandit arm, the agent picks a
bandit arm to maximize its own expected reward plus incentive, and the
principal observes which arm is chosen and receives a reward (different than
that of the agent) for the chosen arm. Designing policies for the principal is
challenging because the principal cannot directly observe the reward that the
agent receives for their chosen actions, and so the principal cannot directly
learn the expected reward using existing estimation techniques. As a result,
the problem of designing policies for this scenario, as well as similar ones,
remains mostly unexplored. In this paper, we construct a policy that achieves a
low regret (i.e., square-root regret up to a log factor) in this scenario for
the case where the agent has perfect-knowledge about its own expected rewards
for each bandit arm. We design our policy by first constructing an estimator
for the agent's expected reward for each bandit arm. Since our estimator uses
as data the sequence of incentives offered and subsequently chosen arms, the
principal's estimation can be regarded as an analogy of online inverse
optimization in MAB's. Next we construct a policy that we prove achieves a low
regret by deriving finite-sample concentration bounds for our estimator. We
conclude with numerical simulations demonstrating the applicability of our
policy to real-life setting from collaborative transportation planning.

measured by the ratio of positive samples within a cluster to their correlation
degree. This measurement is adopted as an indication of demographic bias. Then,
a novel loss function is introduced to encourage a purity consistency for all

Moreover, we present a novel attention mechanism, Cross-attention, to measure

unneglectable since they may distort mobility patterns and lead to wrongly or
biased conclusions. For transportation studies driven by GPS data, assuring the
data quality by removing noises caused by data oscillations is undoubtedly
important. Most GPS-based studies simply remove oscillations by checking the
high speed. However, this method can mistakenly identify normal points as
oscillations. Some other studies specifically discuss the removal of outliers
in GPS data, but they all have limitations and do not fit passively collected
GPS data. Many studies are well developed for addressing the ping-pong
phenomenon in cellular data, or cellular tower data, but the oscillations in
passively collected GPS data are very different for having much more various

insufficient and inapplicable to passively collected GPS data. This paper aims
to address the oscillated points in passively collected GPS data. A set of
heuristics are proposed by identifying the abnormal movement patterns of
oscillations. The proposed heuristics well fit the features of passively
collected GPS data and are adaptable to studies of different scales, which are
also computationally cost-effective in comparison to current methods.

quality of service, particularly for low-latency services, by enabling
computing offloading to edge servers (ESs) in close proximity. To avoid network
congestion, collaborative edge computing has become an emerging paradigm to
enable different ESs to collaboratively share their data and computation
resources. However, most papers in collaborative edge computing only allow
one-hop offloading, which may limit computing resource sharing due to either
poor channel conditions or computing workload at ESs one-hop away. By allowing
ESs multi-hop away to also share the computing workload, a multi-hop MEC
enables more ESs to share their computing resources. Inspired by this
observation, in this paper, we propose to leverage omnipresent vehicles in a
city to form a data transportation network for task delivery in a multi-hop
fashion. Here, we propose a general multi-hop task offloading framework for
vehicle-assisted MEC where tasks from users can be offloaded to powerful ESs

develop a reinforcement learning based task offloading approach to address the

each portion subsequently following semi-classical trajectories. We can model

these challenges, we propose an encoder-based approach for personalization. We
learn an identity encoder which can extract an identity representation from a

large and impactful marine heat waves and by theoretical expectation that the
dominant heating processes coherently affect large regions of the ocean, we
introduce a methodology from computer vision to construct marine heat wave
systems (MWHSs) -- the collation of SST extrema in dimensions of area and time.
We identify 649,475 MHWSs in the 37 year period (1983-2019) of daily SST
records and find that the duration t_dur (days), maximum area A_max (km$^2$),
and total ``volume'' N_vox (days km$^2$) for the majority of MHWSs are
well-described by power-law distributions: t_dur^(-3), A_max^(-2) and
N_vox^(-2). These characteristics confirm SST extrema exhibit strong spatial
coherence that define the formation and evolution of marine heat waves.
Furthermore, the most severe MHWSs deviate from these power-laws and are the
dominant manifestation of marine heat waves: extrema in ocean heating are
driven by the ~200 systems with largest area and duration. We further
demonstrate that the previously purported rise in the incidence of marine heat
wave events over the past decade is only significant in these severe systems. A
change point analysis reveals a rapid increase in days under a severe MHW in
most regions of the global ocean over the period of 2000-2005. Understanding
the origin and impacts of marine heat waves in the current and future ocean,
therefore, should focus on the production and evolution of the largest-scale

summarization is very challenging due to obvious distinctions in health trouble
descriptions from patients and doctors. Although existing works have attempted
to utilize Seq2Seq, reinforcement learning, or contrastive learning to solve
the problem, two challenges remain: how to correctly capture question focus to
model its semantic intention, and how to obtain reliable datasets to fairly
evaluate performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel
medical question summarization framework using entity-driven contrastive
learning (ECL). ECL employs medical entities in frequently asked questions
(FAQs) as focuses and devises an effective mechanism to generate hard negative
samples. This approach forces models to pay attention to the crucial focus

find that some MQA datasets suffer from serious data leakage problems, such as
the iCliniq dataset's 33% duplicate rate. To evaluate the related methods

of the communication channel which requires only the scattering parameters of

multi-antenna single-carrier systems under frequency-flat channels, we show
that neglecting the mutual coupling effects leads to inaccurate
characterization of the channel and noise correlations. We also extend the
analysis to frequency-selective multicarrier channels wherein we further
demonstrate that the coupling between the antenna elements within each array
increases the number of resolvable channel taps. Standard LMMSE estimators
based on existing inaccurate channel models become sub-optimal when applied to
the new physically consistent model. We hence develop a new LMMSE estimator
that calibrates the coupling and optimally estimates the MIMO channel. It is
shown that appropriately accounting for mutual coupling through the developed
physically consistent model leads to remarkable performance improvements both
in terms of channel estimation accuracy and achievable rate. We demonstrate
those gains in a rich-scattering environment using a connected array of slot

theoretical abstraction of large-scale parallel processing models such as
MapReduce. In this model, assuming the widely believed 1-vs-2-cycles
conjecture, it is not possible to solve many basic graph problems in constant
rounds with strongly sublinear memory size per machine.
  Recently, Holm and T\v{e}tek [SODA 2023] showed that it is possible to get
around this barrier for planar graphs when a planar straight-line embedding of
the graph is given. For such inputs on $n$ vertices, they obtained
constant-round MPC algorithms for connected components, minimum spanning tree
(MST), and $O(1)$-approximation of $st$-shortest path, diameter, and radius, as
long as the memory size per machine is $\mathcal{S} = n^{2/3 + \Omega(1)}$.
  In this work, we provide an improved recursive framework to obtain
constant-round algorithms in the more challenging \emph{fully scalable} regime
where memory size per machine can be $\mathcal{S} = n^\delta$ for any given
constant $\delta > 0$. This gives the first constant-round algorithms in this
regime for fundamental problems such as connected components, MST, and EMST.
  Moreover, we show that $\varepsilon$-emulators can be incorporated into our
recursive framework to obtain constant-round $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation
algorithms for single source shortest path (SSSP) and shortest cycle in
embedded planar graphs. We show that it is possible to construct a dual graph
of the given embedded planar graph in constant rounds, which allows us to solve
the $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate $st$-maximum flow and minimum cut problem as
both reduce to a shortest cycle problem in the dual graph. Using $O(n^2)$ total

long-ranged orientational order featuring a quasi-layered periodicity imparted
by a helical configuration but lacking positional order. Doping molecular
cholesteric LCs with thin colloidal rods with a large length-to-width ratio or
disks with a large diameter-to-thickness ratio adds another level of complexity
to the system because of the interplay between weak surface boundary conditions
and bulk-based elastic distortions around the particle-LC interface. By using
colloidal disks and rods with different geometric shapes and boundary
conditions, we demonstrate that these anisotropic colloidal inclusions exhibit
biaxial orientational probability distributions, where they tend to orient with
the long rod axes and disk normals perpendicular to the helix axis, thus
imparting strong local biaxiality on the hybrid cholesteric LC structure.
Unlike the situation in achiral hybrid molecular-colloidal LCs, where biaxial
order emerges only at modest to high volume fractions of the anisotropic
colloidal particles, the orientational probability distribution of colloidal
inclusions immersed in chiral nematic hosts are unavoidably biaxial even at
vanishingly low particle volume fractions. In addition, the colloidal
inclusions induce local biaxiality in the molecular orientational order of the
LC host medium, which enhances the weak biaxiality of the LC in a chiral
nematic phase coming from the symmetry breaking caused by the presence of the
helical axis. With analytical modeling and computer simulations based on
minimizing the Landau de Gennes free energy of the host LC around the
colloidals, we explain our experimental findings and conclude that the biaxial
order of chiral molecular-colloidal LCs is strongly enhanced as compared to
both achiral molecular-colloidal LCs and molecular cholesteric LCs and is
rather unavoidable.

Specifically, we propose a novel superclass approach that automatically creates

we design a novel framework called Soft Multiple Superclass (SMS) to extract
relevant features or characteristics of classes in the same superclass. A new
class assigned to the superclass is easier to classify by leveraging these

characterized by similar electron temperatures of 0.1 -- 0.3 keV and similar
photon indices around 2.2 -- 3. It remains a puzzle why both values are not
sensitive to the black hole mass nor accretion rate. Supposing that the
scattering-dominated surface layer of an accretion disk can act as a warm
corona, we construct a vertically one-zone model to understand what determines
its temperature. By solving the equations of (1) the condition for the
effective optical depth, (2) the energy balance, and (3) dominance of the
Compton cooling over the bound-free cooling, we could reproduce the basic
observational features of the soft excess, provided that anomalous heating
takes place in the warm corona. The similar temperatures can be understood,
since both of the anomalous heating and Compton cooling rates are proportional
to the dissipation rate of the accretion energy, while similar photon indices
are a natural consequence of the fact that observed photons are finally emitted
from the layer of Compton $y\sim 1$. The warm corona solutions only exist at
smaller radii, indicating the structure of a warm corona inside and a hot
corona outside. The soft excess is not observed in black hole binaries, since
disk temperatures are too high for the Compton scattering to work as cooling.
The derived temperatures are somewhat underestimation, however. This may
indicate a necessity of multi-zone corona structure. The stability of the warm
corona and its consequences are briefly discussed.

structure-property relationships concerning nanomaterial surface science is
systematically illustrated, based on a chemisorption model through competitive
orbital redistribution from bulk energy bands into surface chemisorption bonds.
The physical nature of enhanced surface reactivity by size reduction lies in
weakening lattice confinement on surface atomic orbitals and amplifying the
effects of other structural factors such as defects. Nanoscale cooperative
chemisorption (NCC) model reveals the general physical principles driving size-
and coverage-dependent ligand-nanomaterial interactions owing to orbital
competitions between bulk energy bands and surface adsorption bonds. NCC theory
can interpret the impacts and trends of ligand-induced surface effects on

Unlike the conventional PT-symmetric systems which typically require two or
more modes, here the PT-symmetric feedback system contains only a single
resonance mode, which greatly extends the scope of applications. The method
enables remarkable linewidth narrowing and enhancement of measurement

achieving a 48-fold narrowing of the magnetic resonance linewidth. By applying
the method in magnetometry, we realize a 22-times improvement of the

incomes, talents, resources, and citations, amongst many others. Its intensity
varies across different environments: from relatively evenly distributed ones,
to where a small group of stakeholders controls the majority of the available
resources. We would like to understand why inequality naturally arises as a
consequence of the natural evolution of any system. Studying simple
mathematical models governed by intuitive assumptions can bring many insights
into this problem. In particular, we recently observed (Siudem et al., PNAS
117:13896-13900, 2020) that impact distribution might be modelled accurately by
a time-dependent agent-based model involving a mixture of the rich-get-richer

process that generates rank distributions of any length and a predefined level
of inequality, as measured by the Gini index.
  Many indices quantifying the degree of inequality have been proposed. Which
of them is the most informative? We show that, under our model, indices such as
the Bonferroni, De Vergottini, and Hoover ones are equivalent. Given one of
them, we can recreate the value of any other measure using the derived
functional relationships. Also, thanks to the obtained formulae, we can
understand how they depend on the sample size. An empirical analysis of a large

we systematically selected a pool of 74 studies using particular inclusion and

primary vital factors to add to agile documentation from our pool of studies.
Our analysis shows that agile practitioners have primarily developed their

that the tools and techniques in agile documentation are not in sync, and they
separately solve different challenges. Conclusions: Based on our results and
discussion, researchers and practitioners will better understand how current
agile documentation tools and practices perform. In addition, investigation of

needed for effective learning of its governing laws and accurate prediction of
its future evolution behavior, and how to select these critical samples? In
this work, we propose to explore this problem based on a design approach.
Starting from a small initial set of samples, we adaptively discover critical
samples to achieve increasingly accurate learning of the system evolution. One
central challenge here is that we do not know the network modeling error since
the ground-truth system state is unknown, which is however needed for critical
sampling. To address this challenge, we introduce a multi-step reciprocal
prediction network where forward and backward evolution networks are designed
to learn the temporal evolution behavior in the forward and backward time
directions, respectively. Very interestingly, we find that the desired network
modeling error is highly correlated with the multi-step reciprocal prediction
error, which can be directly computed from the current system state. This
allows us to perform a dynamic selection of critical samples from regions with
high network modeling errors for dynamical systems. Additionally, a joint
spatial-temporal evolution network is introduced which incorporates spatial
dynamics modeling into the temporal evolution prediction for robust learning of
the system evolution operator with few samples. Our extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method is able to dramatically reduce the
number of samples needed for effective learning and accurate prediction of
evolution behaviors of unknown dynamical systems by up to hundreds of times.

representation of point clouds instead of fine-grained points or voxels to
reduce the computational burden. We introduce a novel Region-Enhanced Feature

stage and a Region Dependency Modeling (RDM) stage. In the SSRE stage, we group
the input points into a set of regions according to the point distances in both

fuse point features with the region features to obtain more discriminative

integrated with common semantic segmentation backbones. We conduct extensive

this unit can be formulated as a moving-boundary problem for a degenerating
system of convection-diffusion reaction equations whose unknowns are the
concentrations of the components forming the solid and liquid phases,
respectively. This model is transformed to a fixed computational domain and is
discretized by an explicit monotone scheme along with an alternative
semi-implicit variant. The semi-implicit variant is based on solving, during
each time step, a system of nonlinear equations for the total solids
concentration followed by the solution of linear systems for the solid
component percentages and liquid component concentrations. It is demonstrated
that the semi-implicit scheme is well posed and that both variants produce
approximations that satisfy an invariant region principle: solids
concentrations are nonnegative and less or equal to a set maximal one,
percentages are nonnegative and sum up to one, and substrate concentrations are
nonnegative. These properties are achieved undera Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)
condition that is less restrictive for the semi-implicit than the explicit
variant. Numerical examples with realistic parameters illustrate that as a
consequence, the semi-implicit variant is more efficient than the explicit one.

(D2D) communications have emerged to improve spectrum utilization by reusing
the frequency spectrum of the cellular frequency band. In the general
environment, Heterogeneous Cellular Networks (HCNs) including millimeter wave

resources with the cellular user, it will bring potential interference to the
cellular user. Fortunately, an emerging technology called Reconfigurable
Intelligent Surface (RIS) can mitigate the severe interference caused by D2D
links by shaping the incident beam and improving the multipath phase shift. In
this paper, we study the resource allocation scheme to maximize the system sum
rate, in the RISassisted single-cell heterogeneous D2D communication scenario.
To solve the Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) problem, the problem of maximizing
the sum rate is decomposed into three sub-problems. The resource allocation
sub-problem is solved by a coalitional game method based on the game theory.
The power allocation problem of the coalition converts the concave function
into a convex optimization by mathematical transformation. The problem is
solved by the gradient descent method. The local search method is adopted to
find the optimum for the phase conversion problem. Then iterate until the
difference of sum rate is less than the threshold. The simulation results show
that the designed algorithm is superior to other benchmark schemes in the

with the growing model size. LLMs' size grows by $240\times$ every two years,
which outpaces the hardware progress and makes model inference increasingly
costly. Model quantization is a promising approach to mitigate the widening gap
between LLM size and hardware capacity. However, the existence of outliers,
values with significant magnitudes, in LLMs makes existing quantization methods
less effective. Prior outlier-aware quantization schemes adopt sparsity
encoding techniques to separate outliers from normal values where the process
requires global coordination (e.g., a global sparsity coordination list). This
incurs complex encoding/decoding hardware logics and an extra orchestration
controller for the computation between outlier and normal values. As such, it
is not hardware-efficient and hence only achieves sub-optimal quantization
benefits.
  We propose OliVe, an algorithm/architecture co-designed solution that adopts
an outlier-victim pair (OVP) quantization and handles outlier values locally
with low hardware overheads and high performance gains. The key insight of
OliVe is that outliers are important while the normal values next to them are
not. Thus those normal values (called victims) can be sacrificed to accommodate
outliers. This enables a memory-aligned OVP encoding scheme, which can be
efficiently integrated to the existing hardware accelerators like systolic
array and tensor core. As a result, OliVe-based accelerator surpasses the
existing outlier-aware accelerator, GOBO, by 4.5$\times$ speedup and

tools, but also extend its range to perceive the environment when making
decisions. However, most existing works over-simplified the interaction between
human agents and robots, ignoring the differences between individuals,
resulting in poor experiences for different users. To solve the problem, we
propose a data-driven guiding system to cope with the effect brighten by
individual differences. In our guiding system, we design a Human Motion
Predictor (HMP) and a Robot Dynamics Model (RDM) based on deep neural network,
the time convolutional network (TCN) is verified to have the best performance,
to predict differences in interaction between different human agents and
robots. To train our models, we collected datasets that records the
interactions from different human agents. Moreover, given the predictive
information of the specific user, we propose a waypoints selector that allows
the robot to naturally adapt to the user's state changes, which are mainly
reflected in the walking speed. We compare the performance of our models with
previous works and achieve significant performance improvements. On this basis,
our guiding system demonstrated good adaptability to different human agents.
Our guiding system is deployed on a real quadruped robot to verify the
practicability.

  Hadamard patterns","14 pages, 7 figures",,,,"physics.optics eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Illumination patterns of computational ghost imaging (CGI) systems suffer
from reduced contrast when passing through a scattering medium, which causes
the effective information in the reconstruction result to be drowned out by
noise. A two-dimensional (2D) Gaussian filter performs linear smoothing
operation on the whole image for image denoising. It can be combined with
linear reconstruction algorithms of CGI to obtain the noise-reduced results
directly, without post-processing. However, it results in blurred image edges
while performing denoising and, in addition, a suitable standard deviation is
difficult to choose in advance, especially in an unknown scattering
environment. In this work, we subtly exploit the characteristics of CGI to
solve these two problems very well. A kind of modified Hadamard pattern based
on the 2D Gaussian filter and the differential operation features of
Hadamard-based CGI is developed. We analyze and demonstrate that using Hadamard
patterns for illumination but using our developed modified Hadamard patterns
for reconstruction (MHCGI) can enhance the robustness of CGI against turbid
scattering medium. Our method not only helps directly obtain noise-reduced
results without blurred edges but also requires only an approximate standard
deviation, i.e., it can be set in advance. The experimental results on
transmitted and reflected targets demonstrate the feasibility of our method.
Our method helps to promote the practical application of CGI in the scattering
environment.

acceptability, system usability, and user experience. Significant correlations
were observed between performance in social scenarios, self-reports, and

the capability of the classifier on learning the patterns from different class

employ cross entropy (CE) loss to optimize DA classifiers on low-resource data
with imbalanced DA distribution. The DA classifiers in these studies tend to
prioritize accuracy on the majority class at the expense of the minority class

maximizing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) score (i.e., AUC maximization).
Through extensive experiments, our study provides evidence that (i) by

performance improvement compared to the CE approach under low-resource data,

  Inspired by recently powerful graph mining methods like skip-gram models and
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), existing approaches focus on generating temporal

  However, the sequential modeling of previous approaches cannot handle the
transition structure between nodes' neighbors with limited memorization

interactions can also be constructed as a transition graph.
  Based on the bilevel graph, TIP-GNN further encodes transition structures by
multi-step transition propagation and distills information from neighborhoods
by a bilevel graph convolution.
  Experimental results over various temporal networks reveal the efficiency of
our TIP-GNN, with at most 7.2\% improvements of accuracy on temporal link

cause ethical and data privacy violation issues. Lately, federated learning has
served as a promising solution to exploit multi-center data while getting rid
of the data transfer between institutions. However, high heterogeneity exists
in the data from different centers, and existing federated learning methods
tend to use average aggregation methods to combine the client's information,
which limits the performance and generalization capability of the trained
models. In this paper, we propose a Model-based Federated learning framework
(ModFed). ModFed has three major contributions: 1) Different from the existing
data-driven federated learning methods, model-driven neural networks are
designed to relieve each client's dependency on large data; 2) An adaptive
dynamic aggregation scheme is proposed to address the data heterogeneity issue
and improve the generalization capability and robustness the trained neural
network models; 3) A spatial Laplacian attention mechanism and a personalized
client-side loss regularization are introduced to capture the detailed
information for accurate image reconstruction. ModFed is evaluated on three
in-vivo datasets. Experimental results show that ModFed has strong capability

  The final TAP-GNN supports online inference in the graph stream scenario,
which incorporates the temporal information into node embeddings with a

the well-known over-smoothing issue. To relieve this issue, we propose a

exponential expansion of neighbors, we propose a hierarchical message
aggregation mechanism to interact separately with low-order neighbors and

However, the local areas are encoded by one-hot code, which may lose the

we propose a new soft label coding method, named label smoothing, for the

Methods to estimate correspondences for SSMs typically learn with such labels

unsupervised method that leverages deep geometric features and functional
correspondences to learn local and global shape structures across complex
anatomies simultaneously. Our pipeline significantly improves unsupervised
correspondence estimation for SSMs compared to baseline methods, even on highly

  Approximating the Parameterized $k$-Clique","22 pages, 1 figure",,,,"cs.CC cs.DM cs.DS math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the parameterized $k$-clique problem, or $k$-Clique for short, we are
given a graph $G$ and a parameter $k\ge 1$. The goal is to decide whether there
exist $k$ vertices in $G$ that induce a complete subgraph (i.e., a $k$-clique).
This problem plays a central role in the theory of parameterized intractability
as one of the first W[1]-complete problems. Existing research has shown that
even an FPT-approximation algorithm for $k$-Clique with arbitrary ratio does
not exist, assuming the Gap-Exponential-Time Hypothesis (Gap-ETH) [Chalermsook
et al., FOCS'17 and SICOMP]. However, whether this inapproximability result can
be based on the standard assumption of $\mathrm{W} 1\ne \mathrm{FPT}$ remains
unclear. The recent breakthrough of Bingkai Lin [STOC'21] and subsequent works
by Karthik C.S. and Khot [CCC'22], and by Lin, Ren, Sun Wang [ICALP'22] give a
technique that bypasses Gap-ETH, thus leading to the inapproximability ratio of
$O(1)$ and $k^{o(1)}$ under $\mathrm{W}[1]$-hardness (the first two) and ETH
(for the latter one). All the work along this line follows the framework
developed by Lin, which starts from the $k$-vector-sum problem and requires
some involved algebraic techniques.
  This paper presents an alternative framework for proving the W[1]-hardness of
the $k^{o(1)}$-FPT-inapproximability of $k$-Clique. Using this framework, we
obtain a gap-producing self-reduction of $k$-Clique without any intermediate
algebraic problem. More precisely, we reduce from $(k,k-1)$-Gap Clique to
$(q^k, q^{k-1})$-Gap Clique, for any function $q$ depending only on the
parameter $k$, thus implying the $k^{o(1)}$-inapproximability result when $q$
is sufficiently large. Our proof is relatively simple and mostly combinatorial.
At the core of our construction is a novel encoding of $k$-element subset
stemming from the theory of ""network coding"" and a ""Sidon set"" representation
of a graph.

be an effective paradigm in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning

credit agents by their contributions. Prior studies focus on either implicitly
decomposing the joint value function or explicitly computing the payoff
distribution of all agents. However, in episodic reinforcement learning
settings where global rewards can only be revealed at the end of the episode,
existing methods usually fail to work. They lack the functionality of modeling
complicated relations of the delayed global reward in the temporal dimension
and suffer from large variance and bias. We propose a novel method named
Spatial-Temporal Attention with Shapley (STAS) for return decomposition; STAS
learns credit assignment in both the temporal and the spatial dimension. It
first decomposes the global return back to each time step, then utilizes
Shapley Value to redistribute the individual payoff from the decomposed global
reward. To mitigate the computational complexity of Shapley Value, we introduce
an approximation of marginal contribution and utilize Monte Carlo sampling to
estimate Shapley Value. We evaluate our method on the classical Alice & Bob
example and Multi-agent Particle Environments benchmarks across different

  Objective: This study aims to provide empirical evidence of cost awareness by
mining open source repositories of cloud-based applications. The focus is on
Infrastructure as Code artifacts that automate software (re)deployment on the
cloud.
  Methods: A systematic search through 152,735 repositories resulted in the
selection of 2,010 relevant ones. We then analyzed 538 relevant commits and 208
relevant issues using a combination of inductive and deductive coding.
  Results: The findings indicate that developers are not only concerned with
the cost of their application deployments but also take actions to reduce these
costs beyond selecting cheaper cloud services. We also identify research areas
for future consideration.
  Conclusion: Although we focus on a particular Infrastructure as Code

incorporate progressively more details to represent potential long-term system
developments and the operation of power grids with intermittent renewable
generation. However, the increased modeling complexities of TEP exercises can
easily lead to computationally intractable optimization problems. Currently,
most techniques that address computational intractability alter the original
problem, thus neglecting critical modeling aspects or affecting the structure
of the optimal solution. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to
significantly alleviate the computational burden of large-scale TEP problems.
Our approach integrates machine learning (ML) with the well-established Benders

computational efficiency by identifying effective and ineffective optimality
cuts via supervised learning techniques. We illustrate the benefits of the

They are automated accounts, commonly called bots. Focusing on Twitter
accounts, we propose a novel approach to bot detection: we first propose a new
algorithm that transforms the sequence of actions that an account performs into
an image; then, we leverage the strength of Convolutional Neural Networks to
proceed with image classification. We compare our performances with
state-of-the-art results for bot detection on genuine accounts / bot accounts

  scattering from large-scale MD simulations",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The application of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to the interpretation
of Raman scattering spectra is hindered by inability of atomistic simulations
to account for the dynamic evolution of electronic polarizability, requiring
the use of either ab initio method or parameterization of machine learning
models. More broadly, the dynamic evolution of electronic-structure-derived
properties cannot be treated by the current atomistic models. Here, we report a
simple, physically-based atomistic model with few (maximum 10 parameters for
the systems considered here) adjustable parameters that can accurately
represent the changes in the electronic polarizability tensor for molecules and
solid-state systems. Due to its compactness, the model can be applied for
simulations of Raman spectra of large (~ 1,000,000-atom) systems with modest
computational cost. To demonstrate its accuracy, the model is applied to the
CO2 molecule, water clusters, and BaTiO3 and CsPbBr3 perovskites and shows good
agreement with ab-initio-derived and experimental polarizability tensor and
Raman data. The atomistic nature of the model enables local analysis of the
contributions to Raman spectra, paving the way for the application of MD
simulations for the interpretation of Raman spectroscopy results. Furthermore,
our successful atomistic representation of the evolution of electronic
polarizability suggests that the evolution of electronic structure and its
derivative properties can be represented by atomistic models, opening up the
possibility of studies of electronic-structure-dependent properties using
large-scale atomistic simulations.

address this scalability problem, this paper proposes RoboREIT, an interactive
Robotic tutor for Requirements Elicitation Interview Training. The humanoid
robotic component of RoboREIT responds to the questions of the interviewer,
which the interviewer chooses from a set of predefined alternatives for a
particular scenario. After the interview session, RoboREIT provides contextual
feedback to the interviewer on their performance and allows the student to
inspect their mistakes. RoboREIT is extensible with various scenarios.
[Results] We performed an exploratory user study to evaluate RoboREIT and
demonstrate its applicability in requirements elicitation interview training.
The quantitative and qualitative analyses of the users' responses reveal the
appreciation of RoboREIT and provide further suggestions about how to improve
it. [Contribution] Our study is the first in the literature that utilizes a

innovative design incorporates replaying faulty interview stages and allows the

equivalent semantics, it is possible to find `completions' to more expressive
syntaxes that are semantically invariant. Doctrine theory, in the sense of
Lawvere, is the natural categorical framework in which to express completions
for first-order logic. We study the suitability of a fibred generalisation of
the ideal completion of a preorder to act as a completion for doctrines to the
syntax of geometric logic. In contrast to other completions of doctrines
considered in the literature, our completion takes a Grothendieck topology as a
second argument. As a result, the geometric completion is idempotent, as well
as being `semantically invariant' for any doctrine whose models can be
expressed as a category of continuous flat functors, encompassing a wide class
of the most commonly considered doctrines.
  We also relate the geometric completion to other completions of doctrines
considered in the literature: first, by studying the behaviour of the geometric
completion when the second argument is omitted, and then by studying the
interaction with those completions of doctrines that complete to a fragment of
geometric logic. Throughout, we reference how these completions of doctrines
yield completions of categories via the syntactic category construction. We
demonstrate that it is equivalent to represent logical theories by either
doctrines or syntactic categories, in so far as they have equivalent
classifying toposes.

plattnerite (\b{eta}-PbO2). Chemical treatments were used but they can put the
pictorial layers supports at risks. Hereby we address the possibility of
thermally reconverting black plattnerite to white lead carbonates via a
massicot (\b{eta}-PbO) intermediate, with a view to developing a restoration
procedure using continuous wave laser heating. We first investigated the
conditions (temperature, time, and environment) in which pure powders react,
before studying mural painting samples. Experiments were made in ovens and TGA
and XRD and SEM characterization were achieved. Litharge ({\alpha}-PbO) and
massicot were obtained from plattnerite respectively between 564 and 567

plumbonacrite) formed from massicot in wet CO2 below 100 {\deg}C in a few
hours. Lastly, when heating plattnerite based mural painting samples, lead
species reacted with binders and mortar, yielding massicot, plumbonacrite but
also lead silicate and calcium lead oxides. This demonstrates the viability of
thermal reconversion of darkened lead in mural, while raising concerns about
the formation of several lead species by reaction with mural painting

Area-Under-Curve Receiver Operating Characteristic accuracy is nearly
indistinguishable from that of the floating point network. The FPGA MLPF

effect can be explained using the ideal Donnan theory, but for low grafting
densities the full shift is due to a combination of the Donnan effect and the
polyelectrolyte effect. The latter originates from electrostatic correlations
which are neglected in the Donnan picture and which are only approximately
included in the mean-field theory. Moreover, we demonstrate that the magnitude
of the polyelectrolyte effect is almost invariant with respect to salt
concentration but depends on the grafting density of the brush. This invariance
is due to a complex cancellation of multiple effects. Based on our results, we
show how the experimentally determined p$K_\mathrm{A}$ shifts may be used to
infer the grafting density of brushes, a parameter that is difficult to measure

domain-specific knowledge, which may not be generally available. This hinders
the widespread adoption of MT. Fortunately, we observe that developers often
embed such domain knowledge that encodes MRs in test cases, even without the
awareness of metamorphic testing. These encoded MRs might be generalized and
useful for testing the original programs (where these MRs are found) and other

  In this paper, we propose MR-Extractor, to automatically discover metamorphic
relations from existing test cases in open-source software (OSS) projects.
MR-Extractor firstly identifies MR-encoded test cases in OSS, and then
generalizes encoded MRs and codifies them into parameterized methods (called

aligned with the position angle of the radio jet in the plane of the sky. At
the same time, the observed high polarization degree could be obtained only for
a high inclination of the X-ray emitting flow, indicating a misalignment
between the binary axis and the black hole spin. The jet, in turn, is believed
to be directed by the spin axis, hence similar misalignment is expected between
the jet and binary axes. We test this hypothesis using very long (up to about
26 years) multi-band radio observations. We find the misalignment of
$20^\circ$-$30^\circ$; however, on the contrary to the earlier expectations,

of opinion dynamics that utilizes an environmental averaging protocol similar
to the DeGroot and Freidkin-Johnsen models. Indeed, the way opinions evolve is
complex and nonlinear effects ought to be considered when modelling. For this
model, the nonlinearity destroys the translation invariance of the equations,
as well as the convexity of the associated payout functions. The standard
theory for well-posedness and convergence no longer applies and we must utilize
the Brouwer topological degree and nonconvex analysis in order to achieve these

describe the motion of shallow water waves under the influence of gravity. This
is a highly nonlinear and strongly coupled system of partial differential
equations. A crucial issue in designing numerical schemes is to preserve
invariants as many as possible at the discrete level. In this paper, we present
a provable implicit nonlinear difference scheme which preserves at least three
discrete conservation invariants: energy, mass, and momentum, and prove the
existence of the difference solution via the Browder theorem. The error
analysis is based on novel and refined estimates of the bilinear operator in
the difference scheme. By skillfully using the energy method, we prove that the
difference scheme not only converges unconditionally when the rotational
parameter diminishes, but also converges without any step-ratio restriction for
the small energy case when the rotational parameter is nonzero. The convergence
orders in both settings (zero or nonzero rotation parameter) are $O(\tau^2 +
h^2)$ for the velocity in the $L^\infty$-norm and the surface elevation in the
$L^2$-norm, where $\tau$ denotes the temporal stepsize and $h$ the spatial
stepsize, respectively. The theoretical predictions are confirmed by a properly
designed two-level iteration scheme. Comparing with existing numerical methods
in the literature, the proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness for
long-time simulation over larger domains and superior resolution for both

search, in which the core idea is to learn the consistent visionlanguage
representations. Although the performance of cross-modal retrieval has greatly
improved with the development of deep models, we unfortunately find that
traditional hard consistency may destroy the original relationships among
single-modal instances, leading the performance degradation for single-modal
retrieval. To address this challenge, in this paper, we experimentally observe
that the vision-language divergence may cause the existence of strong and weak
modalities, and the hard cross-modal consistency cannot guarantee that strong
modal instances' relationships are not affected by weak modality, resulting in
the strong modal instances' relationships perturbed despite learned consistent
representations.To this end, we propose a novel and directly Coordinated
VisionLanguage Retrieval method (dubbed CoVLR), which aims to study and
alleviate the desynchrony problem between the cross-modal alignment and
single-modal cluster-preserving tasks. CoVLR addresses this challenge by
developing an effective meta-optimization based strategy, in which the
cross-modal consistency objective and the intra-modal relation preserving
objective are acted as the meta-train and meta-test tasks, thereby CoVLR
encourages both tasks to be optimized in a coordinated way. Consequently, we
can simultaneously insure cross-modal consistency and intra-modal structure.
Experiments on different datasets validate CoVLR can improve single-modal
retrieval accuracy whilst preserving crossmodal retrieval capacity compared
with the baselines.

the solution of non-linear hyperbolic partial differential equations on
unstructured polygonal meshes. The time discretization is based on a splitting
between explicit and implicit terms that may arise either from the multi-scale
nature of the governing equations, which involve both slow and fast scales, or
in the context of projection methods, where the numerical solution is projected
onto the physically meaningful solution manifold. We propose to use a high
order finite volume (FV) scheme for the explicit terms, ensuring conservation
property and robustness across shock waves, while the virtual element method
(VEM) is employed to deal with the discretization of the implicit terms, which
typically requires an elliptic problem to be solved. The numerical solution is
then transferred via suitable L2 projection operators from the FV to the VEM
solution space and vice-versa. High order time accuracy is achieved using the
semi-implicit IMEX Runge-Kutta schemes, and the novel schemes are proven to be
asymptotic preserving and well-balanced. As representative models, we choose
the shallow water equations (SWE), thus handling multiple time scales
characterized by a different Froude number, and the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations (INS), which are solved at the aid of a projection
method to satisfy the solenoidal constraint of the velocity field. Furthermore,
an implicit discretization for the viscous terms is devised for the INS model,
which is based on the VEM technique. Consequently, the CFL-type stability
condition on the maximum admissible time step is based only on the fluid
velocity and not on the celerity nor on the viscous eigenvalues. A large suite
of test cases demonstrates the accuracy and the capabilities of the new family
of schemes to solve relevant benchmarks in the field of incompressible fluids.

  Tasks: An Empirical Study",,,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Pre-trained models of code have gained widespread popularity in many code
intelligence tasks. Recently, with the scaling of the model and corpus size,
large language models have shown the ability of in-context learning. These
models employ task instructions and a few demonstration examples as prompts to
learn the semantics of the task and make predictions for test samples. This new
learning paradigm is training-free and has shown impressive performance in
various natural language processing and code intelligence tasks. However, the
performance of in-context learning heavily relies on the quality of
demonstration, and there has been no systematic investigation into how to
construct a good demonstration for code-related tasks with in-context learning.
  In this paper, by analyzing the design space of in-context demonstration, we
empirically explore the impact of three key factors on the performance of
in-context learning in code intelligence tasks: the selection of demonstration
examples, the order of demonstration examples, and the number of demonstration
examples. We conduct extensive experiments on three code intelligence tasks
including bug fixing, code summarization, and program synthesis. Our
experimental results demonstrate that all the above three factors dramatically
impact the performance of in-context learning in code intelligence tasks.
Additionally, we summarize our findings and provide takeaway suggestions on how
to construct effective demonstrations, taking into account these three
perspectives. We show that a well-constructed demonstration can lead to
significant improvements over simple demonstrations and previous fine-tuned
state-of-the-art models, e.g., improving EM, BLEU-4, and EM by at least 11.91%,
36.88%, and 37.18% on code summarization, bug fixing and program synthesis,

context, results of statistical inference rely on the bivariate extreme values
approach, disregarding the extremal dependence among a large number of
financial institutions that make up the market. In order to take it into
account we propose an inferential procedure based on the multivariate regular
variation theory. We derive an approximating formula for the extreme marginal
expected shortfall and obtain from it an estimator and its bias-corrected
version. Then, we show their asymptotic normality, which allows in turn the
confidence intervals derivation. Simulations show that the new estimators
greatly improve upon the performance of existing ones and confidence intervals
are very accurate. An application to financial returns shows the utility of the
proposed inferential procedure. Statistical results are extended to a general
$\beta$-mixing context that allows to work with popular time series models with
heavy-tailed innovations.

post-stall wake characteristics remains largely unexplored. To address this
issue, we conduct an extensive study using direct numerical simulations to
characterize the wing taper effect on laminar separated wakes. We analyze flows
behind NACA 0015 cross-sectional profile wings at post-stall angles of attack
$\alpha=14^\circ$--$22^\circ$ with taper ratios $\lambda=0.27$--$1$, leading
edge sweep angles $0^\circ$--$50^\circ$, and semi aspect ratios $sAR =1$ and
$2$ at a mean-chord-based Reynolds number of $600$ and a freestream Mach number
of $0.1$. Wing taper reduces the tip chord length, weakening the tip vortex,
and attenuates the inboard downwash over the wing. This results in unsteadiness
to develop over a large portion of the wingspan at high angles of attack.
Tapered wings with backward-swept leading edges develop unsteadiness near the
wing tip, while wings with forward-swept trailing edges concentrate wake
oscillations at the wing root. For highly swept untapered wings, the wake is
steady, while tapered wings with high leading edge sweep angles exhibit wake
shedding near the tip. Wake oscillations are larger towards the root for lower
taper ratios. Moreover, the effects of taper on the aerodynamic forces over
tapered wings are studied, revealing that the combined effect of taper and
sweep can improve the aerodynamic performance of the wing. The current findings
shed light on the fundamental effects of wing taper on the post-stall wake
dynamics.

applications, including image search in digital pathology. Despite the recent
progress in computer vision, significant issues remain for image searching in
histopathology archives. A well-known problem is AI bias and lack of
generalization. A more particular shortcoming of deep models is the ignorance
toward search functionality. The former affects every model, the latter only
search and matching. Due to the lack of ranking-based learning, researchers
must train models based on the classification error and then use the resultant
embedding for image search purposes. Moreover, deep models appear to be prone
to internal bias even if using a large image repository of various hospitals.
This paper proposes two novel ideas to improve image search performance. First,
we use a ranking loss function to guide feature extraction toward the
matching-oriented nature of the search. By forcing the model to learn the
ranking of matched outputs, the representation learning is customized toward
image search instead of learning a class label. Second, we introduce the
concept of sequestering learning to enhance the generalization of feature
extraction. By excluding the images of the input hospital from the matched
outputs, i.e., sequestering the input domain, the institutional bias is
reduced. The proposed ideas are implemented and validated through the largest
public dataset of whole slide images. The experiments demonstrate superior
results compare to the-state-of-art.

such phenomena (e.g., disasters) have clear spatial footprints and geographical

existing graph visualization tools, limiting their capability to reveal the
geospatial distribution patterns of the graph nodes. In addition, most graph
visualization techniques rely on 2D graph visualization, which constraints the
dimensions of information that can be presented and lacks support for graph

developed a novel 3D map-based graph visualization algorithm to enable

map, an additional geolocational force, and a force balancing variable that
allows for the dynamic adjustment of the 3D graph structure and layout. This
mechanism helps create a balanced graph view between the semantic forces among

consistently been reported as the most distracting, and causing performance
decrements for workers. Notwithstanding this generalization, the 'babble'
created by multiple simultaneously active talkers can sometimes provide
beneficial sound masking, but due to spatial release from masking (SRM), speech
may still be sufficiently intelligible up to a certain number of talkers
(estimated to be about four). This was explored within a highly-realistic
office simulation, where the cognitive performance, and subjective distraction
of participants were tested. The experimental design was a 4x2 factorial (4
talker numbers, 2 levels of broadband sound masking, as the factors). The
results indicated that within lower sound pressure level (SPL) of broadband
sound masking, multi-talker sound environments degraded cognitive tasks
performance more than those with a single talker, suggesting SRM effects. For
higher SPL broadband sound masking, the cognitive test scores were similar
within the different talker numbers. The subjective distraction increased
monotonically with the number of talkers, with higher distraction within lower
SPL broadband sound masking. Overall, the results call into question the single
talker assumption (being the most distracting) within the international
standard for measuring open-plan office acoustic environments (ISO

open-plan offices needs better characterization by incorporating some of the
complexity and psychoacoustics of multi-talker scenarios.

  oscillator via machine learning",,,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The master stability function (MSF) yields the stability of the globally
synchronized state of a network of identical oscillators in terms of the
eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. In order to compute the MSF, one must have
an accurate model of an uncoupled oscillator, but often such a model does not
exist. We present a machine learning technique for estimating the MSF given
only the time series of a single, uncoupled oscillator. We demonstrate the
generality of our technique by considering a variety of coupling configurations
of networks consisting of Lorenz oscillators or H{\'e}non maps.

centrality at the Cooling-Storage-Ring External-target Experiment (CEE) in the
Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL). A Boosted Decision Trees (BDT)
multi-classification algorithm is employed to classify the centrality of the
collision events based on the raw features from ZDC such as the number of fired
channels and deposited energy. The data from simulated $\rm ^{238}U$ + $\rm
^{238}U$ collisions at 500 $\rm MeV/u$, generated by the IQMD event generator
and subsequently modeled through the GEANT4 package, is employed to train and
test the BDT model. The results showed the high accuracy of the
multi-classification model adopted in ZDC for centrality determination, which
is robust against variations in different factors of detector geometry and
response. The study demonstrates a good performance of the CEE-ZDC for
determining the centrality in nucleus-nucleus collisions.

  historical perspectives",,,"10.1016/j.apacoust.2021.107943",,"eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Open-plan offices (OPOs) have been around for more than half a century now,
chronicling the vicissitudes of workplace topography amongst other factors.
This paper addresses one such factor - the sound environment in occupied OPOs
in relation to several objective workplace parameters, using measurements in
contemporary OPOs and comparisons with studies over the last 50 years.
Omnidirectional and binaural sound measurements were conducted in 43 offices
during typical working hours. The results describe variation in several
acoustic and psychoacoustic metrics, and present statistical models that
predict these metrics as a function of the number of workstations in offices.
LA,eq of 53.6 dB is typical for occupied OPOs, with spectral slope of
approximately -4 dB/octave. LA,eq values do not vary much over the workplace
parameters studied (e.g., floor plate area, work activity, etc), except for
-2.7 dB and -4.1 dB differences between offices with/without carpeting, and
offices with ceiling absorption but with/without carpeting, respectively; most
likely from reduced floor impact noise leading to speech level reduction. Sound
fluctuation, as characterised by the metric Noise Climate (NCl: LA10 - LA90)
and the psychoacoustic Fluctuation Strength (FS), decreases significantly with
increasing number of workstations in OPOs. This suggests lesser auditory
distraction in larger offices, which needs further investigation. In terms of
historical trends, OPOs have become quieter over the years, especially
background noise quantified as LA90, although there are several subtleties.
Overall, current findings can inform several OPO design perspectives including
policy documents, provide values for laboratory simulations of OPO acoustic
environments, help interpret subjective impressions of OPO occupants, etc.

spaces (TDS). Digital spaces are combinatorial models of continuous spaces. TDS
is one of alternative branches of digital topology that studies constructing
and modifying 2, 3 and n-dimensional digital image arrays in a computer and its
memory. Demands for mathematical theory of multidimensional spaces built of
finite number of points appeared in connection with the use of many dimensional
images in computer programs. This work presents, as examples, digital models of
n-dimensional Euclidean spaces, n-dimensional spheres, a torus, a projective
plane, etc. Methods of TMS can work successfully in such areas as biology,
chemistry, industry, medicine, etc. The book is organized as follows. Digital
models of continuous spaces are the intersection graphs of special locally
centered lamp covers of continuous spaces. Digital models are represented by
graphs, algebraic matrices and a set of unit cubes in n-dimensional Euclidean
space. The main mathematical characteristics of digital models of continuous
spaces, such as the dimension, the Euler characteristic, the homology groups
and others, are the same as those of their continuous counterparts.
Contractible transformations of digital spaces, that change the number of
elements, do not change the mathematical characteristics and properties of
digital spaces. The main goal is to construct digital models of continuous
spaces and to explain how to use the new methods to work with mathematical
objects. The emphasis is on introducing the readers to the basics and
conceptual understanding of what TDS is.

neighborhood area network (NAN) architecture. We explore the main features of
low-rate machine-type wireless networks, and also we describe a technology
characterization of wireless neighborhood area networks (WNAN) in medium-range
coverage applications. We propose a new-improved irregular repetition slotted
ALOHA, combing Raptor codes and irregular ALOHA, namely RapIRSA random access
protocol, to better respond to critical high-reliability QoS requirements under
a 5G network perspective. Then, we compare and comprehensively analyze the
proposed RapIRSA protocol with two existing RA protocols, the IRSA protocol,
and the classical Slotted Aloha. Finally, We summarize the potential challenges
in implementing the proposed RA protocol for SG critical applications

technique. However, implementation of FL over modern wireless networks faces
key challenges caused by (i) dynamics of the network conditions, (ii)
coexistence of multiple FL services/tasks in the system, and (iii) concurrent
execution of FL services with other network services, which are not jointly
considered in prior works. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce a
generic FL paradigm over next-generation (NextG) networks, called dynamic
multi-service FL (DMS-FL). We identify three unexplored design considerations
in DMS-FL: (i) FL service operator accumulation, (ii) wireless resource
fragmentation, and (iii) signal strength fluctuations. We take the first steps
towards addressing these design considerations through proposing a novel
distributed ML architecture called elastic virtualized FL (EV-FL). EV-FL
unleashes the full potential of Open RAN (O-RAN) systems and introduces an
elastic resource provisioning methodology to execute FL services. It further
constitutes a multi-time-scale FL management system that introduces three
dimensions into existing FL architectures: (i) virtualization, (ii)
scalability, and (iii) elasticity. Through investigating EV-FL, we reveal a
series of open research directions for future work. We finally simulate EV-FL
to demonstrate its potential to save wireless resources and increase fairness
among FL services.

for heat dissipation due to its outstanding thermal conductivity. However, the
accompanied high electrical conductivity makes it unfavorable for thermal
management of high power electronics since it runs a high risk of short
circuits. To eliminate the risk from the high electrical conductivity and
simultaneously maintain the excellent thermal performance, we introduce boron
nitride nanosheets (BNNS) that possess high thermal conductivity but electrical
insulation into the GNS paper. The hybrid paper has a much lower electrical
conductivity but similar thermal performance compared to the pristine GNS
paper. Besides, the flexible hybrid paper exhibits better thermal stability
than pure GNS paper. Our results show that the ability of BNNS to change the
electrical conductivity of paper without affecting its thermal conductivity is
potential for the application of heat management materials with tailored

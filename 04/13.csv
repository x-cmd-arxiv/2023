on the contribution of various non-pharmaceutical measures in breaking the 3rd
Corona wave in Germany. The main finding is that testing contributed more to
the containment of the pandemic in this phase than vaccination or contact
restrictions. The analysis is based on a new epidemiological cohort model that
represents testing, vaccination and contact restrictions by time-varying rates
of detection, vaccination and contacts, respectively.
  Only the effectiveness of different vaccines is taken from the literature.
All other parameters are automatically identified in such a way that the
simulated and the published incidences and death rates match. Among these
parameters are incubation time, mean duration of the infectious phase,
mortality rate, as well as two contact rates and one detection rate per week.
  Note that we can reconstruct such a high number of parameters only because we
assume that the weekly wave patterns in new infections follow real infection
dynamics, periodically driven by high contact rates on weekdays and lower ones
on weekends. Usually, people assume that the weekly wave patterns are just
reporting artefacts and that weekly mean values are the finest usable data.
  One focus of the paper is to quantify the increase in detection rate due to
the introduction of rapid testing in schools. For this purpose, we compare
federal states that differ in the start of school tests and Easter holidays.
There is a clear temporal correlation with the identified detection rates.
  Finally, we compare the effect of the individual non-pharmaceutical measures
by replacing one by one the fitted rates of detection, vaccination and contacts
by neutral ones. The increase in the simulated number of actually infected
persons measures the effect of the measure ignored.

however they suffer from blurry generated samples and reconstructions compared
to the images they have been trained on. Significant research effort has been
spent to increase the generative capabilities by creating more flexible models
but often flexibility comes at the cost of higher complexity and computational
cost. Several works have focused on altering the reconstruction term of the
evidence lower bound (ELBO), however, often at the expense of losing the
mathematical link to maximizing the likelihood of the samples under the modeled
distribution. Here we propose a new formulation of the reconstruction term for
the VAE that specifically penalizes the generation of blurry images while at
the same time still maximizing the ELBO under the modeled distribution. We show
the potential of the proposed loss on three different data sets, where it
outperforms several recently proposed reconstruction losses for VAEs.

of non-trivial dynamics of the inflaton field and its interactions with other
fields. Often when examining and constraining the scalar non-Gaussianity
arising from inflation, certain templates are adopted for the scalar
non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{_{\rm NL}}$, in classifying their behaviors in
terms of wavenumbers. The current constraints from cosmic microwave background
(CMB) on such templates of $f_{_{\rm NL}}$ are weak and provide rather large
bounds on their amplitudes. In this work, we explore a different method of
constraining $f_{_{\rm NL}}$ through their effect on the scalar power. We
compute the correction to the scalar power due to $f_{_{\rm NL}}$ while
accounting for its generic scale dependence. We then compute the angular power
spectrum of CMB arising from such non-Gaussian corrections to explore possible
imprints. We initially illustrate this method using the conventional templates
of $f_{_{\rm NL}}$ such as local, equilateral and orthogonal types, with and
without the running of the parameter. We further employ this method to an
oscillatory form of $f_{_{\rm NL}}$ and lastly on a realistic model of
inflation proposed by Starobinsky. Though this method does not improve much on
the constraints on the first three templates of $f_{_{\rm NL}}$, it provides
interesting insights on models that do not conform to these templates. We infer
that the non-Gaussian correction to the spectrum can be sensitive to model
parameters that are degenerate at the level of the original power spectrum.
Hence, this method of computing indirect imprints of $f_{_{\rm NL}}$ on angular
power spectrum of CMB provides a new avenue to explore primordial scalar
non-Gaussianity and possibly constrain them effectively.

underexplored, source of data for building scene representations are 3D models
that are readily available on the Internet, e.g., hand-drawn CAD models, 3D
models generated from building footprints, or from aerial images. These models
allow to perform visual localization right away without the time-consuming
scene capturing and model building steps. Yet, it also comes with challenges as
the available 3D models are often imperfect reflections of reality. E.g., the
models might only have generic or no textures at all, might only provide a
simple approximation of the scene geometry, or might be stretched. This paper
studies how the imperfections of these models affect localization accuracy. We
create a new benchmark for this task and provide a detailed experimental
evaluation based on multiple 3D models per scene. We show that 3D models from
the Internet show promise as an easy-to-obtain scene representation. At the

interesting targets because they host a rich population of terrestrial planets.
Here we present the JWST detection of abundant hydrocarbons in the disk of a
very low-mass star obtained as part of the MIRI mid-INfrared Disk Survey

lack of small silicate grains implies that we can look deep down into this

high C/O ratio in the inner 0.1 au of this disk, perhaps due to destruction of
carbonaceous grains. The exceptionally high C$_2$H$_2$/CO$_2$ and
C$_2$H$_2$/H$_2$O column density ratios suggest that oxygen is locked up in icy

significant consequences for the composition of forming exoplanets.

three finite modular groups. Assuming supersymmetry, consistent with the
holomorphicity requirement, we consider all 10d orbifolds of the form
$(\mathbb{T}^2)^3/(\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_M)$, and list those which have
fixed values of the moduli fields (up to an integer). The key advantage of such
10d orbifold models over 4d models is that the values of the moduli are not
completely free but are constrained by geometry and symmetry. To illustrate the

of remote sensing, and has a wide range of applications in Earth science. HSIs
contain hundreds of continuous bands, which are characterized by high dimension
and high correlation between adjacent bands. The high dimension and redundancy
of HSI data bring great difficulties to HSI classification. In recent years, a
large number of HSI feature extraction and classification methods based on deep
learning have been proposed. However, their ability to model the global
relationships among samples in both spatial and spectral domains is still
limited. In order to solve this problem, an HSI classification method with
spectral-spatial diffusion models is proposed. The proposed method realizes the
reconstruction of spectral-spatial distribution of the training samples with
the forward and reverse spectral-spatial diffusion process, thus modeling the
global spatial-spectral relationship between samples. Then, we use the
spectral-spatial denoising network of the reverse process to extract the
unsupervised diffusion features. Features extracted by the spectral-spatial
diffusion models can achieve cross-sample perception from the reconstructed
distribution of the training samples, thus obtaining better classification
performance. Experiments on three public HSI datasets show that the proposed
method can achieve better performance than the state-of-the-art methods. The

  ""Intelligent Information Technologies for Industry"" in St. Petersburg",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new approach called NAF (the Neural Attention Forest) for solving
regression and classification tasks under tabular training data is proposed.
The main idea behind the proposed NAF model is to introduce the attention
mechanism into the random forest by assigning attention weights calculated by
neural networks of a specific form to data in leaves of decision trees and to
the random forest itself in the framework of the Nadaraya-Watson kernel
regression. In contrast to the available models like the attention-based random
forest, the attention weights and the Nadaraya-Watson regression are
represented in the form of neural networks whose weights can be regarded as
trainable parameters. The first part of neural networks with shared weights is
trained for all trees and computes attention weights of data in leaves. The
second part aggregates outputs of the tree networks and aims to minimize the
difference between the random forest prediction and the truth target value from
a training set. The neural network is trained in an end-to-end manner. The
combination of the random forest and neural networks implementing the attention
mechanism forms a transformer for enhancing the forest predictions. Numerical
experiments with real datasets illustrate the proposed method. The code
implementing the approach is publicly available.

Universe to synthesize heavy elements is an endeavour pursued since the 1950s,
but that has proven elusive up to now due to the experimental difficulty of
generating the extreme neutron fluxes required. It has been evoked that
laser-driven (pulsed) neutron sources could produce neutron beams with
characteristics suitable to achieve nucleosynthesis in the laboratory. In this
scheme, the laser first generates an ultra-high-current, high-energy proton
beam, which is subsequently converted into a dense neutron beam. Here we model,
in a self-consistent manner, the transport of laser-accelerated protons through
the neutron converter, the subsequent neutron generation and propagation, and
finally the neutron capture reactions in a gold ($^{197}$Au) sample. Using the
parameters of present-day available lasers, as well as of those foreseeable in
the near future, we find that the final yield of the isotopes containing two
more neutrons than the seed $^{197}$Au nuclei is negligible. Our investigation
highlights that the areal density of the laser-driven neutron source is a
critical quantity and that it should be considerably increased over the current
state of the art in order to offer realistic prospects for laser-based
generation of neutron-rich isotopes.

built on a tight convex relaxation of the Maximum Likelihood position estimator
for a generic network. To serve positioning to mobile agents, a horizon-based
version is developed accounting for velocity measurements at each agent. To
solve the convex problem, a distributed gradient-based method is provided. This
constitutes an advantage over other centralized approaches, which usually
exhibit high latency for large networks and present a single point of failure.
Additionally, the algorithm estimates all required parameters and effectively
becomes parameter-free. Our solution to the dynamic network localization

parameter-free, outlier-robust and trajectory-agnostic algorithm, with nearly
constant positioning error regardless of the trajectories of agents and
anchors, achieving better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art

elastic flows, as much as monatomic gas mixtures with disparate masses and
single polyatomic gases, providing a unify approach for vector valued solutions
in weighted vector Banach spaces.
  Novel aspects of this work include developing the extension of a general ODE
theory in vector valued weighted Banach spaces, precise lower bounds for the
collision frequency in terms of the weighted Banach norm, energy identities and
the consequently angular or compact manifold averaging lemmas which provide
coerciveness resulting into global in time stability, a new combinatorics
estimate for $p$-binomial forms producing sharper estimates for the $k$-moments
of bi-linear collisional forms. These techniques enable the Cauchy problem
improvement that resolves the model with initial data corresponding to strictly
positive and bounded initial vector valued mass and total energy, in addition
to only $2^+$ moment determined by the hard potential rates discrepancy, a
result comparable in generality to the classical Cauchy theory of the scalar
homogeneous Boltzmann equation.

Casimir interaction between dielectric objects immersed in salted water at room

the sparsity, irregularity, and unordered nature of the data. Current methods
rely on complex local geometric extraction techniques such as convolution,

tasks. These approaches contradict the fundamental goal of few-shot learning,
which is to facilitate efficient learning. To address this issue, we propose
GPr-Net (Geometric Prototypical Network), a lightweight and computationally
efficient geometric prototypical network that captures the intrinsic topology
of point clouds and achieves superior performance. Our proposed method, IGI++
(Intrinsic Geometry Interpreter++) employs vector-based hand-crafted intrinsic
geometry interpreters and Laplace vectors to extract and evaluate point cloud
morphology, resulting in improved representations for FSL (Few-Shot Learning).
Additionally, Laplace vectors enable the extraction of valuable features from
point clouds with fewer points. To tackle the distribution drift challenge in
few-shot metric learning, we leverage hyperbolic space and demonstrate that our
approach handles intra and inter-class variance better than existing point
cloud few-shot learning methods. Experimental results on the ModelNet40 dataset
show that GPr-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot learning on

a subset of combinational modules in a design dependent on a secret key that is
withheld from untrusted parties. If an incorrect secret key is used, a set of
deterministic errors is produced in locked modules, restricting unauthorized
use. A common target for logic locking is neural accelerators, especially as
machine-learning-as-a-service becomes more prevalent. In this work, we explore
how logic locking can be used to compromise the security of a neural

caused by incorrect keys can be harnessed to produce neural-trojan-style
backdoors. To do so, we first outline a motivational attack scenario where a
carefully chosen incorrect key, which we call a trojan key, produces
misclassifications for an attacker-specified input class in a locked
accelerator. We then develop a theoretically-robust attack methodology to
automatically identify trojan keys. To evaluate this attack, we launch it on

identified a trojan key that caused a 74\% decrease in classification accuracy

sacrificing the realness of the data and introducing domain gaps. In this work,
we revisit the classic stereo setup for training data collection -- capturing
two images of the same scene with one UDC and one standard camera. The key idea
is to ""copy"" details from a high-quality reference image and ""paste"" them on
the UDC image. While being able to generate real training pairs, this setting
is susceptible to spatial misalignment due to perspective and depth of field
changes. The problem is further compounded by the large domain discrepancy
between the UDC and normal images, which is unique to UDC restoration. In this
paper, we mitigate the non-trivial domain discrepancy and spatial misalignment
through a novel Transformer-based framework that generates well-aligned yet
high-quality target data for the corresponding UDC input. This is made possible
through two carefully designed components, namely, the Domain Alignment Module
(DAM) and Geometric Alignment Module (GAM), which encourage robust and accurate
discovery of correspondence between the UDC and normal views. Extensive
experiments show that high-quality and well-aligned pseudo UDC training pairs

[Fe/H]=$-$2.3. We take advantage of synthetic spectra and isochrones that
account for the chemical composition of multiple populations to identify
photometric diagrams that separate the distinct stellar populations of GCs. We
derived high-precision photometry and proper motion for main-sequence stars in
the metal-poor GC M 92 from JWST and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. We
identified a first generation (1G) and two main groups of second-generation
stars (2G$_{\rm A}$ and 2G$_{\rm B}$) and investigated their kinematics and
chemical composition. We find isotropic motions with no differences among the
distinct populations. The comparison between the observed colors of M 92 stars
and the colors derived by synthetic spectra reveals that helium abundance of
2G$_{\rm A}$ and 2G$_{\rm B}$ stars are higher than that of the 1G by $\Delta Y
\sim 0.01$ and $0.04$, respectively. The $m_{\rm F090W}$ vs. $m_{\rm

concepts degrade. To circumvent this forgetting, we propose a new method,
C-LoRA, composed of a continually self-regularized low-rank adaptation in cross
attention layers of the popular Stable Diffusion model. Furthermore, we use
customization prompts which do not include the word of the customized object
(i.e., ""person"" for a human face dataset) and are initialized as completely
random embeddings. Importantly, our method induces only marginal additional
parameter costs and requires no storage of user data for replay. We show that
C-LoRA not only outperforms several baselines for our proposed setting of
text-to-image continual customization, which we refer to as Continual
Diffusion, but that we achieve a new state-of-the-art in the well-established
rehearsal-free continual learning setting for image classification. The high
achieving performance of C-LoRA in two separate domains positions it as a
compelling solution for a wide range of applications, and we believe it has
significant potential for practical impact.

that the cluster density gradient and the extended mass distribution of
subhalos are important in determining image properties. Both lead to an

For example, on the negative parity side, subhalos with cores larger than about
$50\,$pc do not generate any images with magnification above $\sim 100$ outside

hot, magnetically dominated corona surrounding a cold disc. Simulations with
net vertical flux (NF) magnetic fields launch powerful magnetocentrifugal winds

better converged with increasing box height than analogous isothermal

sufficiently strong to evaporate a thin disc and form a radiatively inefficient
accretion flow under some conditions. We find evidence for multiphase structure
in the corona, with broad density and temperature distributions, and we propose
criteria for the formation of a multiphase corona. The fraction of cooling in
the surface layers of the disc is substantially larger for NF fields compared
to zero net-flux configurations, with moderate NF simulations radiating
${\gtrsim}30$ per cent of the flow's total luminosity above two midplane
scale-heights. Our work shows that NF fields may efficiently power the coronae

intensity but not in polarimetry, and propose an explanation for the origin of
this arc. Assuming geometric parameters for the birth ring of planetesimals,
our model provides the positions of millions of particles of different sizes to
compute scattered light images. We demonstrate that if the grain size
distribution is truncated or strongly peaks at a size larger than the radiation
pressure blow-out size we are able to produce an arc quite similar to the
observed one. If the birth ring is radially narrow, given that particles of a
given size have similar eccentricities, they will have their apocenters at the
same distance from the star. Since this is where the particles will spend most
of their time, this results in a ""apocenter pile-up"" that can look like a ring.
Due to more efficient forward scattering this arc only appears in total
intensity observations and remains undetected in polarimetric data. This
scenario requires sharp variations either in the grain size distribution or for
the scattering efficiencies $Q_\mathrm{sca}$. Alternative possibilities such as
a wavy size distribution and a size-dependent phase function are interesting
candidates to strengthen the apocenter pile-up. We also discuss why such arcs

state during its outburst in 2021. In this paper, we focused our study on the
evolution of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) and noise components using
power-density spectra. In addition, we derived hardness ratios comparing count
rates above and below 2 keV. The evolution from the hard to the soft state was
a somewhat erratic process showing several transitions between states that are
dominated by top-flat noise and can show type-C QPOs; those that are dominated
by red noise and can show type-B QPOs. From the parameters that we studied, we
only found a strong correlation between the hardness ratio and the type of QPO
observed. This implies that the appearance of type-B QPOs is related to a
change in the accretion geometry of the system that also reflects in altered
spectral properties. We also observed that the type-B QPO forms from or
disintegrates into a broad peaked feature when the source comes out of or goes
to the hard-intermediate state, respectively. This implies some strong
decoherence in the process that creates this feature.

use of a distinct subgrid physics: Astrid. We find that also in this case,
neural networks are able to infer the value of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ with a
$\sim10\%$ precision from the properties of individual galaxies while
accounting for astrophysics uncertainties as modeled in CAMELS. This tight
relationship is present at all considered redshifts, $z\leq3$, and the stellar

most important galaxy properties behind the relation. In order to use this
method with real galaxies, one needs to quantify its robustness: the accuracy
of the model when tested on galaxies generated by codes different from the one

galaxies from four different codes: IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, Astrid, and

on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) can be tuned via the metal
composition in the TMDC layer. While Gr/MoSe$_2$, has a normal gap, proximity
to WSe$_2$ instead leads to valley-Zeeman-driven inverted bands. Although the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ index vanishes, these systems enable a concentration-dependent
topological crossover with band gap closure when graphene is stacked on a
composite or alloyed TMDC layer. This is due to a nonzero Berry curvature at
the individual valleys and a change of the valley Chern index at a critical
composition ratio. Therefore, inherently, we also expect that stacked
heterostructures of graphene on composite TMDC layers should host localised
boundary modes due to the presence of Gr/WSe$_2$- and Gr/MoSe$_2$-like domains
with opposite valley Chern indices. In this study, we show that a
Gr/(Mo-W)Se$_2$ heterostructure with a lateral interface in the TMDC layer can
indeed host topologically protected in-gap propagating modes, similar to those
at the border of commensurate AB and BA domains in biased minimally-twisted
bilayer graphene. However, the stability of these modes depends crucially on
the system size. We demonstrate that the electronic behaviour of
Gr/(Mo-W)Se$_2$ heterostructures evolves from a homogeneous effective medium to
a superposition of domain-localised bands and zero-energy branch crossings as
the domain size in the alloyed TMDC layer is increased.

non-computational states while simultaneously suppressing the static
controlled-phase entangling rate ($ZZ$) down to kHz levels, all without
requiring strict parameter matching. Here we implement FTF with a flux-tunable
transmon coupler and demonstrate a microwave-activated controlled-Z (CZ) gate
whose operation frequency can be tuned over a 2 GHz range, adding frequency
allocation freedom for FTF's in larger systems. Across this range,
state-of-the-art CZ gate fidelities were observed over many bias points and
reproduced across the two devices characterized in this work. After optimizing
both the operation frequency and the gate duration, we achieved peak CZ
fidelities in the 99.85-99.9\% range. Finally, we implemented model-free
reinforcement learning of the pulse parameters to boost the mean gate fidelity
up to $99.922\pm0.009\%$, averaged over roughly an hour between scheduled
training runs. Beyond the microwave-activated CZ gate we present here, FTF can
be applied to a variety of other fluxonium gate schemes to improve gate
fidelities and passively reduce unwanted $ZZ$ interactions.

The computational bottleneck of the classical algorithm -- symmetric matrix
inversion -- is addressed here using the variational quantum linear solver

Subaru Strategic Program. Control galaxies (without quasars) are selected by
matching the redshifts and stellar masses of the quasar hosts. A two-step
pipeline is run to decompose the PSF and \sersic\ components, and then measure
asymmetry indices ($A_{\rm CAS}$, $A_{\rm outer}$, and $A_{\rm shape}$) of each
quasar host and control galaxy. We find a mild correlation between host
asymmetry and AGN bolometric luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$) for the full sample
(spearman correlation of 0.37) while a stronger trend is evident at the highest
luminosities ($L_{\rm bol}>45$). This then manifests itself into quasar hosts
being more asymmetric, on average, when they harbor a more massive and highly
accreting black hole. The merger fraction also positively correlates with
$L_{\rm bol}$ and reaches up to 35\% for the most luminous. Compared to control
galaxies, quasar hosts are marginally more asymmetric (excess of 0.017 in
median at 9.4$\sigma$ level) and the merger fractions are similar ($\sim
16.5\%$). We quantify the dependence of asymmetry on optical band which
demonstrates that mergers are more likely to be identified with the bluer bands
and the correlation between $L_{\rm bol}$ and asymmetry is also stronger in
such bands. We stress that the band dependence, indicative of a changing
stellar population, is an important factor in considering the influence of

volunteers, but its practices have been adopted far beyond these initial
scenarios. For instance, the strategic use of OSS in industry is constantly
growing nowadays in different verticals, including energy, automotive, and
health. For the public sector, however, the adoption has lagged behind even if
benefits particularly salient in the public sector context such as improved
interoperability, transparency, and digital sovereignty have been pointed out.
When Public Sector Organisations (PSOs) seek to engage with OSS, this
introduces challenges as they often lack the necessary technical capabilities,
while also being bound and influenced by regulations and practices for public
procurement. Aim: We aim to shed light on how public sector OSS projects, i.e.,
projects initiated, developed and governed by public sector organizations, are
developed and structured. We conjecture, based on the challenges of PSOs, that
the way development is organized in these type of projects to a large extent
disalign with the commonly adopted bazaar model (popularized by Eric Raymond),
which implies that development is carried out collaboratively in a larger
community. Method: We plan to contrast public sector OSS projects with a set of
earlier reported case studies of bazaar OSS projects, including Mockus et al.'s
reporting of the Apache web server and Mozilla browser OSS projects, along with

in the re-ionization epoch of the Universe. Green Pea galaxies (GPs) postulate
as favorite local laboratories. However, at their typical redshift of
$z\sim0.2$, the most intimate interaction between stars and surrounding ISM
cannot be disentangled. Detailed studies of Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies (BCDs)
are necessary to anchor our investigations on them. We present here a study in
detail UM 462, a BCD with similar properties to GPs uisng high quality optical
IFS data with MUSE. Total oxygen abundance by means of the direct method is
12+$\log$(O/H)$\sim$8.02 and homogenous all over the galaxy, in stark contrast
with the metallicities derived from several strong line methods. The velocity
field for the ionised gas presents a velocity stratification in the area
towards the north with redder velocities in the high ionisation lines and bluer
velocities in the low ionisation lines. This is the only area with velocity
dispersions clearly above the MUSE instrumental width, and it is surrounded by
two $\sim$1 kpc-long structures nicknamed \emph{the horns}. We interpret the
observational evidence in that area as a fragmented super-bubble fruit of the
stellar feedback and it may constitute a preferred channel for LyC photons from
the youngest generation of stars to escape. The most recent SF seems to
propagate from the outer to the inner parts of the galaxy, and then from east
to west. We identified a supernova remnant and Wolf-Rayet stars - as traced by
the red bump - that support this picture. The direction of the propagation
implies the presence of younger Wolf-Rayet stars at the maximum in H$\alpha$.
The ensemble of results exemplifies the potential of 2D detailed spectroscopic
studies of dwarf star-forming galaxies at high spatial resolution as key

of a large black hole that ``gobbles'' a tiny, traversable wormhole. This
calculation has physical meaning in the extreme mass ratio limit. Two setups
are considered: a single-mouth wormhole connecting two otherwise independent
universes, and a double-mouth zero-length wormhole within the same universe. In
the first setting it turns out that, at early times, there exist two
disconnected horizons, one in each universe, which then merge as the wormhole
falls into the large black hole. In the second setup, we observe the appearance
of an `island', a region of spacetime that is spatially disconnected from the
exterior of the black hole, but in causal contact with future null infinity.
The island shrinks as time evolves and eventually disappears after sufficient
time has elapsed, as compared to the distance between the two mouths. This
provides a communication channel with the interior of the large black hole for
a certain time interval. We compute numerically the lifetime of the island and
verify that it depends linearly on the inter-mouth distance. Extending the
analysis to wormholes with finite length, we show that the achronal averaged
null energy condition prevents the appearance of islands.

it is possible to perform fast dark matter density field emulations with
competitive accuracy using simple machine-learning approaches. We build an
emulator based on dimensionality reduction and machine learning regression
combining simple Principal Component Analysis and supervised learning methods.
For the estimations with a single free parameter, we train on the dark matter
density parameter, $\Omega_m$, while for emulations with two free parameters,
we train on a range of $\Omega_m$ and redshift. The method first adopts a
projection of a grid of simulations on a given basis; then, a machine learning
regression is trained on this projected grid. Finally, new density cubes for
different cosmological parameters can be estimated without relying directly on
new N-body simulations by predicting and de-projecting the basis coefficients.
We show that the proposed emulator can generate density cubes at non-linear
cosmological scales with density distributions within a few percent compared to
the corresponding N-body simulations. The method enables gains of three orders
of magnitude in CPU run times compared to performing a full N-body simulation
while reproducing the power spectrum and bispectrum within $\sim 1\%$ and $\sim

us to distinguish between Noether charges and Page (or Komar) charges which
satisfy the Gauss law. We make use of the latter to compute corrections to the
angular momentum and electric charge of the supersymmetric black hole in
AdS$_5$ from its corrected near-horizon geometry. This also allows us to derive
the microcanonical form of the entropy as a function of the conserved charges
relying entirely on the near-horizon geometry. Finally, we comment on
four-derivative gauged supergravity in four dimensions, showing that field
redefinitions permit to simplify the action at linear order in the corrections,
so that the equations of motion are those of the two-derivative theory.

were recorded with conventional spectrometers using an AlK(alpha) X-ray source
for spectra collected up to 600 C, and an MgK(Alpha) X-rays source for
temperatures above 600 C. The effect of the thickness, composition, and thermal
stability of that oxide layer is relevant to understanding the functional
properties of superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) cavities used in particle
accelerators. There is a consensus that oxide plays a role in surface
resistance (Rs). The focus of this study is Nb3Sn, which is a promising
material that is used in the manufacturing of superconducting radiofrequency
(SRF) cavities as well as in quantum sensing, and pure Nb, which was included
in the study for comparison. The thermal evolution of the oxide layer in these
two materials is found to be quite different, which is ascribed to the
influence of the Sn atom on the reactivity of the Nb atom in Nb3Sn films. Nb
and Sn atoms in this intermetallic solid have different electronegativity, and
the Sn atom can reduce electron density around neighbouring Nb atoms in the
solid, thus reducing their reactivity for oxygen. This is shown in the
thickness, composition, and thermal stability of the oxide layer formed on
Nb3Sn. The XPS spectra were complemented by grazing incident XRD patterns
collected using the ESRF synchrotron radiation facility. The results discussed
herein shed light on oxide evolution in the Nb3Sn compound and guide its
processing for potential applications of the Nb3Sn-based SRF cavities in

world. In: Gani J. (ed.) A Celebration of Applied Probability, J. Appl.
Probab., vol. 25A, Applied Probability Trust, Sheffield, pp. 287-298, 1988)
where he introduced the index for restless bandits that is the starting point
of this work. Such an index, along with previously proposed indices and more
recent extensions, is shown to be unified through the intuitive concept of
``marginal productivity index'' (MPI), which measures the marginal productivity
of work on a project at each of its states. In a multi-project setting, MPI
policies are economically sound, as they dynamically allocate higher priority
to those projects where work appears to be currently more productive. Besides
being tractable and widely applicable, a growing body of computational evidence
indicates that such index policies typically achieve a near-optimal performance
and substantially outperform benchmark policies derived from conventional
approaches.

hole (SMBH) in three nearby early-type galaxies: NGC0612, NGC1574 and NGC4261.
Our analysis is based on Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)
Cycle 3-6 observations of the $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission line with spatial
resolutions of $14-58$ pc ($0.01''-0.26''$). We detect disc-like CO
distributions on scales from $\lesssim200$ pc (NGC1574 and NGC4261) to
$\approx10$ kpc (NGC0612). In NGC0612 and NGC1574 the bulk of the gas is
regularly rotating. The data also provide evidence for the presence of a
massive dark object at the centre of NGC1574, allowing us to obtain the first
measure of its mass, $M_{\rm BH}=(1.0\pm0.2)\times10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$
(1$\sigma$ uncertainty). In NGC4261, the CO kinematics is clearly dominated by
the SMBH gravitational influence, allowing us to determine an accurate black
hole mass of $(1.62{\pm 0.04})\times10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$ ($1\sigma$
uncertainty). This is fully consistent with a previous CO dynamical estimate
obtained using a different modelling technique. Signs of non-circular gas
motions (likely outflow) are also identified in the inner regions of NGC4261.
In NGC0612, we are only able to obtain a (conservative) upper limit of $M_{\rm
BH}\lesssim3.2\times10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$. This has likely to be ascribed to the
presence of a central CO hole (with a radius much larger than that of the SMBH
sphere of influence), combined with the inability of obtaining a robust
prediction for the CO velocity curve. The three SMBH mass estimates are overall
in agreement with predictions from the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_{\star}$ relation.

more acceptable to the public. Explainable face recognition (XFR) refers to the
problem of interpreting why the recognition model matches a probe face with one
identity over others. Recent studies have explored use of visual saliency maps
as an explanation, but they often lack a deeper analysis in the context of face
recognition. This paper starts by proposing a rigorous definition of
explainable face recognition (XFR) which focuses on the decision-making process
of the deep recognition model. Following the new definition, a similarity-based
RISE algorithm (S-RISE) is then introduced to produce high-quality visual
saliency maps. Furthermore, an evaluation approach is proposed to
systematically validate the reliability and accuracy of general visual
saliency-based XFR methods.

multiple-domain adaptive Legendre-Gauss-Radau collocation method. The method
consists of the following parts. First, a structure detection method is
developed to estimate switch times in the activation and deactivation of
state-variable inequality path constraints. Second, using the detected
structure, the domain is partitioned into multiple-domains where each domain
corresponds to either a constrained or an unconstrained segment. Furthermore,
additional decision variables are introduced in the multiple-domain
formulation, where these additional decision variables represent the switch
times of the detected active state-variable inequality path constraints. Within
a constrained domain, the path constraint is differentiated with respect to the
independent variable until the control appears explicitly, and this derivative
is set to zero along the constrained arc while all preceding derivatives are
set to zero at the start of the constrained arc. The time derivatives of the
active state-variable inequality path constraints are computed using automatic
differentiation and the properties of the chain rule. The method is
demonstrated on two problems, the first being a benchmark optimal control
problem which has a known analytical solution and the second being a
challenging problem from the field of aerospace engineering in which there is
no known analytical solution. When compared against previously developed
adaptive Legendre-Gauss-Radau methods, the results show that the method
developed in this paper is capable of computing accurate solutions to problems

on repeated interactions between the same individuals. But high levels of
cooperation evolve only if the benefit-to-cost ratio exceeds a certain
threshold that depends on memory length. For the best-explored case of
one-round memory, that threshold is two. Here we report that intermediate
mutation rates lead to high levels of cooperation, even if the benefit-to-cost
ratio is only marginally above one, and even if individuals only use a minimum
of past information. This surprising observation is caused by two effects.
First, mutation generates diversity which undermines the evolutionary stability
of defectors. Second, mutation leads to diverse communities of cooperators that
are more resilient than homogeneous ones. This finding is relevant because many
real world opportunities for cooperation have small benefit-to-cost ratios,
which are between one and two, and we describe how direct reciprocity can
attain cooperation in such settings. Our result can be interpreted as showing
that diversity, rather than uniformity, promotes evolution of cooperation.

requires performing many Monte Carlo integrals to marginalise over the
uncertainty in the properties of the individual binaries and the survey
selection bias. These Monte Carlo integrals are subject to fundamental
statistical uncertainties. Previous treatments of this statistical uncertainty
has focused on ensuring the precision of the inferred inference is unaffected,

verifying that astrophysical inferences made with the gravitational-wave

image. However, this native noise space does not possess a convenient
structure, and is thus challenging to work with in editing tasks. Here, we
propose an alternative latent noise space for DDPM that enables a wide range of
editing operations via simple means, and present an inversion method for
extracting these edit-friendly noise maps for any given image (real or
synthetically generated). As opposed to the native DDPM noise space, the
edit-friendly noise maps do not have a standard normal distribution and are not
statistically independent across timesteps. However, they allow perfect
reconstruction of any desired image, and simple transformations on them
translate into meaningful manipulations of the output image (e.g., shifting,
color edits). Moreover, in text-conditional models, fixing those noise maps
while changing the text prompt, modifies semantics while retaining structure.
We illustrate how this property enables text-based editing of real images via
the diverse DDPM sampling scheme (in contrast to the popular non-diverse DDIM
inversion). We also show how it can be used within existing diffusion-based
editing methods to improve their quality and diversity.

(QCE-RKPM) for modeling heterogeneous materials that makes use of techniques
not available to mesh-based methods such as the finite element method (FEM) and
avoids many of the drawbacks in current embedded and immersed formulations
which are based on meshed methods. The different material domains are
discretized independently thus avoiding time-consuming, conformal meshing. In
this approach, the superposition of foreground (inclusion) and background
(matrix) domain integration smoothing cells are corrected by a quasi-conforming
quadtree subdivision on the background integration smoothing cells. Due to the
non-conforming nature of the background integration smoothing cells near the
material interfaces, a variationally consistent (VC) correction for domain
integration is introduced to restore integration constraints and thus optimal
convergence rates at a minor computational cost. Additional interface
integration smoothing cells with area (volume) correction, while
non-conforming, can be easily introduced to further enhance the accuracy and
stability of the Galerkin solution using VC integration on non-conforming
cells. To properly approximate the weak discontinuity across the material
interface by a penalty-free Nitsche's method with enhanced coercivity, the
interface nodes on the surface of the foreground discretization are also shared
with the background discretization. As such, there are no tunable parameters,
such as those involved in the penalty type method, to enforce interface
compatibility in this approach. The advantage of this meshfree formulation is
that it avoids many of the instabilities in mesh-based immersed and embedded
methods. The effectiveness of QCE-RKPM is illustrated with several examples.

be expressed via regular operations when the domination partial order can
itself be expressed as a regular spanner, which covers several natural

agrees with all the existing fixed-order calculations (to three loops).
Notably, our anomalous dimension is different from that obtained in the
infrared evolution equation framework developed earlier by Bartels, Ermolaev,

previously reported agreement at two decimal points based on the numerical
solution of the same equations, the intercept of our large-$N_c$ helicity

intercept at large $N_c$ given by a different analytic expression from ours

widely viewed as a groundbreaking effort to change the $\textit{status quo}$ of
conventional dose-finding strategies in oncology. Unlike in other therapeutic
areas where multiple doses are evaluated thoroughly in dose ranging studies,
early-phase oncology dose-finding studies are characterized by the practice of
identifying a single dose, such as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the
recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Following the spirit of Project Optimus, we
propose an Multi-Arm Two-Stage (MATS) design for proof-of-concept (PoC) and
dose optimization that allows the evaluation of two selected doses from a
dose-escalation trial. The design assess the higher dose first across multiple
indications in the first stage, and adaptively enters the second stage for an
indication if the higher dose exhibits promising anti-tumor activities. In the
second stage, a randomized comparison between the higher and lower doses is
conducted to achieve proof-of-concept (PoC) and dose optimization. A Bayesian
hierarchical model governs the statistical inference and decision making by
borrowing information across doses, indications, and stages. Our simulation
studies show that the proposed MATS design yield desirable performance. An R

time series data has become increasingly significant. To help analyze time
series in data mining applications, many time series representation approaches
have been proposed to convert a raw time series into another series for
representing the original time series. However, existing approaches are not
designed for open-ended time series (which is a sequence of data points being
continuously collected at a fixed interval without any length limit) because
these approaches need to know the total length of the target time series in
advance and pre-process the entire time series using normalization methods.
Furthermore, many representation approaches require users to configure and tune
some parameters beforehand in order to achieve satisfactory representation
results. In this paper, we propose NP-Free, a real-time Normalization-free and
Parameter-tuning-free representation approach for open-ended time series.
Without needing to use any normalization method or tune any parameter, NP-Free
can generate a representation for a raw time series on the fly by converting
each data point of the time series into a root-mean-square error (RMSE) value
based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a Look-Back and Predict-Forward
strategy. To demonstrate the capability of NP-Free in representing time series,
we conducted several experiments based on real-world open-source time series

suggests local sampling algorithms for the size of, e.g., the giant connected
component, the $k$-core, the size and probability of an epidemic outbreak, etc.
In this paper, we study the question of when these algorithms are robust
against misspecification of the graph model, for the special case of the
2-core. We show that, for locally converging graphs with bounded average
degrees, under a weak notion of expansion, a local sampling algorithm provides
robust estimates for the size of both the 2-core and its largest component. Our
weak notion of expansion generalizes the classical definition of expansion,
while holding for many well-studied random graph models.
  Our method involves a two-step sprinkling argument. In the first step, we use
sprinkling to establish the existence of a non-empty $2$-core inside the giant,
while in the second, we use this non-empty $2$-core as seed for a second
sprinkling argument to establish that the giant contains a linear sized
$2$-core. The second step is based on a novel coloring scheme for the vertices
in the tree-part. Our algorithmic results follow from the structural properties
for the $2$-core established in the course of our sprinkling arguments.
  The run-time of our local algorithm is constant independent of the graph
size, with the value of the constant depending on the desired asymptotic
accuracy $\epsilon$. But given the existential nature of local limits, our
arguments do not give any bound on the functional dependence of this constant
on $\epsilon$, nor do they give a bound on how large the graph has to be for
the asymptotic additive error bound $\epsilon$ to hold.

into a dense volume. A superconductor is a macroscopic quantum state that is
protected from the metallic (resistive) state by an energy gap. Unfortunately,
YBCO has an anisotropic gap, known as D-wave because it has the shape of a
$\mathbf{d_{x^2-y^2}}$ chemical orbital. This D-wave gap means that
poly-crystalline wire cannot be made because a few degree misalignment between
grains in the wire leads to a drastic loss in its supercurrent carrying
ability, and thereby its magnetic field limit. The superconductor industry has
responded by growing nearly-single-crystal superconducting YBCO films on
carefully prepared substrate tapes kilometers in length. Heroic development
programs have made such tapes commercially available, but they are very
expensive and delicate. MRI magnet superconductors, such as $\mathbf{NbTi}$ and
$\mathbf{Nb_{3}Sn}$, are formed into poly-crystalline wires because they have
an isotropic gap in the shape of an s chemical orbital (called S-wave) that
makes them insensitive to grain misalignment. However, these materials are
limited to lower magnetic fields and liquid-He temperatures. Here, we modified
YBCO by doping the Y site with Ca and Ce atoms to form
$\mathbf{(Y_{1-x-y}Ca_{x}Ce_{y})Ba_{2}Cu_{3}O_{7-\delta}}$, and show evidence
that it changes to an S-wave gap. Its superconducting transition temperature,

dependence, must be performed for four-boson observables. While existing
four-boson calculations are limited below a threshold cutoff, $\Lambda_{t}$,
above which deeply bound trimers appear, the method used in this calculation
works at higher cutoffs by systematically incorporating the trimer poles in the
four-boson calculation. Tetramer binding energies for cold $^4$He atoms are
computed numerically and it is necessary to go above $\Lambda_{t}$ in order to
obtain convergence. No four-boson force is needed at LO, as argued by previous
studies, but more rigorously demonstrated here by the convergence at much
higher cutoffs. Tetramer binding energies for cold $^4$He atoms agree with
existing calculations. Tetramer binding energies and decay widths are also
computed near the unitary limit. These results in the unitary limit also agree
with existing calculations. The method used in this paper may be extended to
study four-nucleon systems and the cutoff dependence of four-nucleon

energy neutrinos, by measuring the radio signals that are emitted when those
neutrinos interact in the ice. Thanks to the large attenuation length at radio
frequencies, these signals can be detected over distances of several
kilometers. One experiment taking advantage of this is the Radio Neutrino
Observatory Greenland (RNO-G), currently under construction at Summit Station,
near the apex of the Greenland ice sheet. These experiments require a thorough
understanding of the dielectric properties of ice at radio frequencies. Towards
this goal, calibration campaigns have been undertaken at Summit, during which
we recorded radio reflections off internal layers in the ice sheet. Using data
from the nearby GISP2 and GRIP ice cores, we show that these reflectors can be
associated with features in the ice conductivity profiles; we use this
connection to determine the index of refraction of the bulk ice as n=1.778 +/-
0.006.

of methods aimed at uncovering unfairness in recommendation systems beyond
identifying biased user and item features. This paper proposes a new algorithm,
GNNUERS, which uses counterfactuals to pinpoint user unfairness explanations in
terms of user-item interactions within a bi-partite graph. By perturbing the
graph topology, GNNUERS reduces differences in utility between protected and
unprotected demographic groups. The paper evaluates the approach using four
real-world graphs from different domains and demonstrates its ability to
systematically explain user unfairness in three state-of-the-art GNN-based

natural language understanding. Humans show a remarkable aptitude for this, and
can solve many different types of tasks, given definitions in the form of
textual instructions and a small set of examples. Recent work with pre-trained
language models mimics this learning style: users can define and exemplify a
task for the model to attempt as a series of natural language prompts or
instructions. While prompting approaches have led to higher cross-task
generalization compared to traditional supervised learning, analyzing 'bias' in
the task instructions given to the model is a difficult problem, and has thus
been relatively unexplored. For instance, are we truly modeling a task, or are
we modeling a user's instructions? To help investigate this, we develop LINGO,
a novel visual analytics interface that supports an effective, task-driven
workflow to (1) help identify bias in natural language task instructions, (2)
alter (or create) task instructions to reduce bias, and (3) evaluate
pre-trained model performance on debiased task instructions. To robustly
evaluate LINGO, we conduct a user study with both novice and expert instruction
creators, over a dataset of 1,616 linguistic tasks and their natural language
instructions, spanning 55 different languages. For both user groups, LINGO
promotes the creation of more difficult tasks for pre-trained models, that
contain higher linguistic diversity and lower instruction bias. We additionally
discuss how the insights learned in developing and evaluating LINGO can aid in
the design of future dashboards that aim to minimize the effort involved in
prompt creation across multiple domains.

basic questions such as what the constituent particles are. We work here with
black hole thermodynamics (BHT), and the metric geometry of thermodynamics,
which connects to interparticle interactions via the invariant thermodynamic
Ricci scalar curvature $R$. $R$ may be calculated with BHT. In ordinary
thermodynamics (OT), $R$ is positive/negative for interparticle interactions
repulsive/attractive. Its magnitude is the correlation length. The basic
universality of thermodynamics leads us to expect similar relations for BHT.
Our contribution here is motivated by a physical simplification that frequently
occurs at low temperatures $T$ in OT: complicated interactions tend to freeze
out, leaving only basic quantum statistical interactions, those of ideal Fermi
or Bose gasses. Our hope is that similar simplification happens in black holes
in the extremal limit, where the BHT temperature $T \to 0$. We evaluate the
extremal $R$ for twelve BHT literature models, working with the independent
variables mass, angular momentum, charge, and the cosmological constant,
$\{M,J,Q,\Lambda\}$, respectively. We allowed only two of these variables to
fluctuate at a time, with the other two fixed. $M$ always fluctuated, either
$J$ or $Q$ fluctuated, and $\Lambda$ was always fixed. At constant average $M$,
$R$ has limiting divergence $R=c\,T^{-1}$, with the nonsingular constant $c$
depending only on $M$ and the two fixed parameters. $c$ is positive for $11/12$
of the models we examined, and negative only for the tidal charged model. The
positive sign for $R$ indicates a BHT microstructure composed of particles with
repulsive (fermionic) interactions. The limiting BHT expression for $R$
resembles that for 2D and 3D ideal Fermi gasses at constant volume, which also
have limiting divergence $R=c\,T^{-1}$, with positive $c$.

substantive citing may have underappreciated consequences on the allocation of
attention and dynamism in scientific literatures. We develop a novel
agent-based model in which agents cite substantively and rhetorically. Agents
first select papers to read based on their expected quality, read them and
observe their actual quality, become influenced by those that are sufficiently
good, and substantively cite them. Next, agents fill any remaining slots in the
reference lists by (rhetorically) citing papers that support their narrative,
regardless of whether they were actually influential. By turning rhetorical
citing on-and-off, we find that rhetorical citing increases the correlation
between quality and citations, increases citation churn, and reduces citation
inequality. This occurs because rhetorical citing redistributes some citations
from a stable set of elite-quality papers to a more dynamic set with
high-to-moderate quality and high rhetorical value. Increasing the size of
reference lists, often seen as an undesirable trend, amplifies the effects. In
sum, rhetorical citing helps deconcentrate attention and makes it easier to
displace incumbent ideas, so whether it is indeed undesirable depends on the
metrics used to judge desirability.

survey prompts more positively than their non-physics major peers who were in
the same introductory courses, with the largest differences in perceived
recognition, interest, and physics identity and somewhat smaller differences in
self-efficacy, perception of peer interaction, and sense of belonging. Further,
the average survey responses of physics majors for each belief remain largely
constant over time from their first-year of the undergraduate curriculum
through the last year and comparable to the Ph.D. students. This suggests that
students are adjusting their interpretation of the survey items to match the
current level of expertise expected of them. One exception occurs in the second
year, when peer interaction and sense of belonging reach a minimum. Moreover,
physics identity dips to the lowest value in the fourth year when many students
are contemplating continuing in physics beyond their undergraduate years or
switching fields. We also find that perceived recognition is the best predictor

$B_s^{0}\rightarrow\phi\phi$ is performed using $pp$ collision data collected
by the LHCb experiment at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, the center-of-mass energy of 13
TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6 fb^{-1}. The
$\it{CP}$-violating phase and direct $\it{CP}$-violation parameter are measured
to be $\phi_{s\bar{s}s} = -0.042 \pm 0.075 \pm 0.009 $ rad and
$|\lambda|=1.004\pm 0.030 \pm 0.009 $, respectively, assuming the same values
for all polarization states of the $\phi\phi$ system. In these results, the
first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. These parameters
are also determined separately for each polarization state, showing no evidence
for polarization dependence. The results are combined with previous LHCb
measurements using $pp$ collisions at center-of-mass energies of 7 and 8 TeV,
yielding $\phi_{s\bar{s}s} = -0.074 \pm 0.069 $ rad and $|\lambda|=1.009 \pm
0.030$. This is the most precise study of time-dependent $\it{CP} $ violation
in a penguin-dominated $B$ meson decay. The results are consistent with
$\it{CP} $ symmetry and with the Standard Model predictions.

condensates by using a Gaussian process learner to experimentally control the
stirring of the superfluid. The learner optimizes four different outcomes of
the stirring process: (O.I) targeting and (O.II) maximization of the persistent
current winding number; and (O.III) targeting and (O.IV) maximization with time
constraints. The learner optimizations are determined based on the achieved
winding number and the number of spurious vortices introduced by stirring. We
find that the learner is successful in optimizing the stirring protocols,
although the optimal stirring profiles vary significantly depending strongly on
the choice of cost function and scenario. These results suggest that stirring
is robust and persistent currents can be reliably generated through a variety
of stirring approaches.

  performance of GRAPE","14 pages, 6 figures, 1 table",,,,"quant-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) is a popular technique in quantum
optimal control, and can be combined with automatic differentiation (AD) to
facilitate on-the-fly evaluation of cost-function gradients. We illustrate that
the convenience of AD comes at a significant memory cost due to the cumulative
storage of a large number of states and propagators. For quantum systems of
increasing Hilbert space size, this imposes a significant bottleneck. We
revisit the strategy of hard-coding gradients in a scheme that fully avoids
propagator storage and significantly reduces memory requirements. Separately,
we present improvements to numerical state propagation to enhance runtime
performance. We benchmark runtime and memory usage and compare this approach to
AD-based implementations, with a focus on pushing towards larger Hilbert space
sizes. The results confirm that the AD-free approach facilitates the
application of optimal control for large quantum systems which would otherwise
be difficult to tackle.

  Reduction",,,"10.5705/ss.202022.0112",,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sliced inverse regression (SIR, Li 1991) is a pioneering work and the most
recognized method in sufficient dimension reduction. While promising progress
has been made in theory and methods of high-dimensional SIR, two remaining
challenges are still nagging high-dimensional multivariate applications. First,
choosing the number of slices in SIR is a difficult problem, and it depends on
the sample size, the distribution of variables, and other practical
considerations. Second, the extension of SIR from univariate response to
multivariate is not trivial. Targeting at the same dimension reduction subspace
as SIR, we propose a new slicing-free method that provides a unified solution
to sufficient dimension reduction with high-dimensional covariates and
univariate or multivariate response. We achieve this by adopting the recently
developed martingale difference divergence matrix (MDDM, Lee & Shao 2018) and
penalized eigen-decomposition algorithms. To establish the consistency of our
method with a high-dimensional predictor and a multivariate response, we
develop a new concentration inequality for sample MDDM around its population
counterpart using theories for U-statistics, which may be of independent
interest. Simulations and real data analysis demonstrate the favorable finite
sample performance of the proposed method.

  programmer",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Objective: Identifying study-eligible patients within clinical databases is a
critical step in clinical research. However, accurate query design typically
requires extensive technical and biomedical expertise. We sought to create a
system capable of generating data model-agnostic queries while also providing
novel logical reasoning capabilities for complex clinical trial eligibility
criteria.
  Materials and Methods: The task of query creation from eligibility criteria
requires solving several text-processing problems, including named entity
recognition and relation extraction, sequence-to-sequence transformation,
normalization, and reasoning. We incorporated hybrid deep learning and
rule-based modules for these, as well as a knowledge base of the Unified
Medical Language System (UMLS) and linked ontologies. To enable data-model
agnostic query creation, we introduce a novel method for tagging database
schema elements using UMLS concepts. To evaluate our system, called LeafAI, we
compared the capability of LeafAI to a human database programmer to identify
patients who had been enrolled in 8 clinical trials conducted at our
institution. We measured performance by the number of actual enrolled patients
matched by generated queries.
  Results: LeafAI matched a mean 43% of enrolled patients with 27,225 eligible
across 8 clinical trials, compared to 27% matched and 14,587 eligible in

collaborative robots that interact physically or cognitively with humans in
real unstructured environments. However, most existing sensors for use in
robotics are limited by: 1) their scope, measuring single parameters/events and
often requiring multiple types of sensors, 2) being expensive to manufacture,
limiting their use to where they are strictly necessary and often compromising
redundancy, and 3) have null or reduced physical flexibility, requiring further
costs with adaptation to a variety of robot structures. This paper presents a
novel mechanically flexible force and proximity hybrid sensor based on
piezoresistive and self-capacitive phenomena. The sensor is inexpensive and
easy to apply even on complex-shaped robot structures. The manufacturing
process is described, including controlling circuits, mechanical design, and
data acquisition. Experimental trials featuring the characterisation of the
sensor were conducted, focusing on both force-electrical resistance and
self-capacitive proximity response. The sensor's versatility, flexibility,
thinness (1 mm thickness), accuracy (reduced drift) and repeatability
demonstrated its applicability in several domains. Finally, the sensor was
successfully applied in two distinct situations: hand guiding a robot (by touch
commands), and human-robot collision avoidance (by proximity detection).

taken a central role in efforts to improve graduation rates in public schools
across the US. These systems assist in targeting interventions at individual
students by predicting which students are at risk of dropping out. Despite
significant investments and adoption, there remain significant gaps in our
understanding of the efficacy of EWS. In this work, we draw on nearly a
decade's worth of data from a system used throughout Wisconsin to provide the
first large-scale evaluation of the long-term impact of EWS on graduation
outcomes.
  We present evidence that risk assessments made by the prediction system are
highly accurate, including for students from marginalized backgrounds. Despite
the system's accuracy and widespread use, we find no evidence that it has led
to improved graduation rates. We surface a robust statistical pattern that can
explain why these seemingly contradictory insights hold. Namely, environmental
features, measured at the level of schools, contain significant signal about
dropout risk. Within each school, however, academic outcomes are essentially
independent of individual student performance. This empirical observation
indicates that assigning all students within the same school the same
probability of graduation is a nearly optimal prediction.
  Our work provides an empirical backbone for the robust, qualitative
understanding among education researchers and policy-makers that dropout is
structurally determined. The primary barrier to improving outcomes lies not in
identifying students at risk of dropping out within specific schools, but
rather in overcoming structural differences across different school districts.
Our findings indicate that we should carefully evaluate the decision to fund
early warning systems without also devoting resources to interventions tackling
structural barriers.

extend with a One-Way [CLS] token navigation from text to the visual branch

we use the [CLS] token output from the text branch, as an auxiliary semantic
prompt, to replace the [CLS] token in shallow layers of the ViT-based visual

thus promotes semantic segmentation. Furthermore, to better segment tiny

employs a region proposal pre-processing and we get ClsCLIP+. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed ZS3 method achieves a SOTA

predict the consensus value with the minimum number of observable historical
outputs of its own. Accordingly, compared to most existing algorithms only
yielding asymptotic convergence, the present method can attain deadbeat
consensus instead. Moreover, based on the consensus value prediction, instant
individual disagreement degree value of MASs can be calculated in advance as
well. Sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee both the minimal-time
deadbeat consensus and the instant individual disagreement degree prediction.
Finally, both the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed deadbeat

based on time-resolved back-scattered differential absorption Lidar (DIAL)
measurements. The obvious advantage of light-based remote sensing modalities is
their extended spatial range which makes them less sensitive to strictly local
perturbations/modelling errors or the distance to the plume source. In contrast
to other state-of-the-art DIAL methods, we do not make a single scattering
assumption but rather propose a new type modality which includes the collection
of multiply scattered photons from wider/multiple fields-of-view and argue that
this data, paired with a time dependent radiative transfer model, is beneficial
for the reconstruction of certain image features. The resulting inverse problem
is solved by means of a semi-parametric approach in which the image is reduced
to a small number of dispersion related parameters and high-dimensional but
computationally convenient nuisance component. This not only allows us to
effectively avoid a high-dimensional inverse problem but simultaneously
provides a natural regularisation mechanism along with parameters which are
directly related to the dispersion model. These can be associated with
meaningful physical units while spatial concentration profiles can be obtained
by means of forward evaluation of the dispersion process.

for small twist angles, which transits to a ferromagnetic spin polarization
beyond a critical twisting angle $\theta_c$. Our analysis shows that $\theta_c$
decreases as the dot size increases, obeying a criterion, according to which
once the maximum energy difference between electron and hole edge states (in
the single-particle picture) is less than $(U / \gamma_0)\, t_0$, the
spin-polarized energy levels are aligned ferromagnetically [$U$ is the Hubbard

Unlike AA-like dots, AB-like dots exhibit finite magnetization for any twist
angle. Furthermore, in the ferromagnetic polarization state, the ground net
spin for both dot configurations agrees with prediction from Lieb's theorem.

the size of the magnetic loops. The accretion flows never reach the

efficiency of magneto-rotational instability. The dependency on the wavelength
of the loops places a lower limit on the loop size. In the large loop cases,

formation of plasmoids strongly depends on the size of the magnetic loops. The
frequent magnetic reconnection between the magnetic loops is responsible for
the formation of most of the plasmoids. For some plasmoids, Kelvin-Helmholtz

  Data Analysis with Limited Computational Resources",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern statistical analysis often encounters datasets with large sizes. For
these datasets, conventional estimation methods can hardly be used immediately
because practitioners often suffer from limited computational resources. In
most cases, they do not have powerful computational resources (e.g., Hadoop or
Spark). How to practically analyze large datasets with limited computational
resources then becomes a problem of great importance. To solve this problem, we
propose here a novel subsampling-based method with jackknifing. The key idea is
to treat the whole sample data as if they were the population. Then, multiple
subsamples with greatly reduced sizes are obtained by the method of simple
random sampling with replacement. It is remarkable that we do not recommend
sampling methods without replacement because this would incur a significant
cost for data processing on the hard drive. Such cost does not exist if the
data are processed in memory. Because subsampled data have relatively small
sizes, they can be comfortably read into computer memory as a whole and then
processed easily. Based on subsampled datasets, jackknife-debiased estimators
can be obtained for the target parameter. The resulting estimators are
statistically consistent, with an extremely small bias. Finally, the
jackknife-debiased estimators from different subsamples are averaged together
to form the final estimator. We theoretically show that the final estimator is
consistent and asymptotically normal. Its asymptotic statistical efficiency can
be as good as that of the whole sample estimator under very mild conditions.
The proposed method is simple enough to be easily implemented on most practical
computer systems and thus should have very wide applicability.

We study their evaluation and containment problems, providing useful
characterizations for them, and we pinpoint the complexities of these problems.
Perhaps surprisingly, we show that containment for CRPQs becomes undecidable
for atom-injective semantics, and PSPACE-complete for query-injective
semantics, in contrast to the known EXPSPACE-completeness result for the
standard semantics. The techniques used differ significantly from the ones

adopting more powerful encoder networks and iterative encoding. We
theoretically formalize the intuition behind, and our experimental results
establish a new frontier in the trade-off between rate-distortion and decoding

unconstrained scenario, where the appearance of same identity may change
dramatically with extreme variances (e.g., illumination, pose, expression). We
argue that the two crucial issues in SFR, the face quality and burstiness, are
both identity-irrelevant and variance-relevant. The quality and burstiness
assessment are interfered with by the entanglement of identity, and the face
recognition is interfered with by the entanglement of variance. Thus we propose
to separate the identity features with the variance features in a
light-weighted set-based disentanglement framework. Beyond disentanglement, the
variance features are fully utilized to indicate face quality and burstiness in
a set, rather than being discarded after training. To suppress face burstiness
in the sets, we propose a vocabulary-based burst suppression (VBS) method which
quantizes faces with a reference vocabulary. With interword and intra-word
normalization operations on the assignment scores, the face burtisness degrees
are appropriately estimated. The extensive illustrations and experiments
demonstrate the effect of the disentanglement framework with VBS, which gets

RS-Win sample random image patches to compose the window, following a uniform

Active learning adaptively guides the surrogate model training toward the

property and activity prediction due to their capability to efficiently learn
complex molecular graph structures. However, two main limitations persist
including compound representation and model interpretability. While atom-level
molecular graph representations are commonly used because of their ability to
capture natural topology, they may not fully express important substructures or
functional groups which significantly influence molecular properties.
Consequently, recent research proposes alternative representations employing
reduction techniques to integrate higher-level information and leverages both
representations for model learning. However, there is still a lack of study
about different molecular graph representations on model learning and
interpretation. Interpretability is also crucial for drug discovery as it can
offer chemical insights and inspiration for optimization. Numerous studies
attempt to include model interpretation to explain the rationale behind
predictions, but most of them focus solely on individual prediction with little
analysis of the interpretation on different molecular graph representations.
This research introduces multiple molecular graph representations that
incorporate higher-level information and investigates their effects on model
learning and interpretation from diverse perspectives. The results indicate
that combining atom graph representation with reduced molecular graph
representation can yield promising model performance. Furthermore, the
interpretation results can provide significant features and potential
substructures consistently aligning with background knowledge. These multiple
molecular graph representations and interpretation analysis can bolster model

based on a color reference image, and the key is to establish accurate
pixel-level semantic correspondence between these two images. Previous methods
search for correspondence across the entire reference image, and this type of
global matching is easy to get mismatch. We summarize the difficulties in two
aspects: (1) When the reference image only contains a part of objects related
to target image, improper correspondence will be established in unrelated
regions. (2) It is prone to get mismatch in regions where the shape or texture
of the object is easily confused. To overcome these issues, we propose SPColor,
a semantic prior guided exemplar-based image colorization framework. Different
from previous methods, SPColor first coarsely classifies pixels of the
reference and target images to several pseudo-classes under the guidance of
semantic prior, then the correspondences are only established locally between
the pixels in the same class via the newly designed semantic prior guided
correspondence network. In this way, improper correspondence between different
semantic classes is explicitly excluded, and the mismatch is obviously
alleviated. Besides, to better reserve the color from reference, a similarity
masked perceptual loss is designed. Noting that the carefully designed SPColor
utilizes the semantic prior provided by an unsupervised segmentation model,
which is free for additional manual semantic annotations. Experiments
demonstrate that our model outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods both

renormalizable $SO(10)$ GUT model that contains a ${\bf 10}$ complex scalar
field and a ${\bf 126}$ scalar field whose Yukawa couplings with ${\bf 16}$
matter fields provide the quark and charged lepton Yukawa couplings, neutrino
Dirac Yukawa coupling and Majorana mass for the singlet neutrinos. The $SO(10)$
breaking is achieved in two steps by a ${\cal O}(10^{15})$ GeV VEV of a ${\bf
54}$ real scalar field and a ${\cal O}(10^{14})$ GeV VEV of the ${\bf 126}$
field. First, we analyze the gauge coupling unification conditions and
determine the VEV of the ${\bf 126}$ field. Next, we constrain the Yukawa
couplings of the ${\bf 10}$ and ${\bf 126}$ fields at the scale of the ${\bf
126}$ field's VEV from experimental data on quark and charged lepton masses and
quark flavor mixings. Then we express the active neutrino mass with the above
Yukawa couplings and the ${\bf 126}$ field's VEV based on the Type-1 seesaw
mechanism, and fit neutrino oscillation data, thereby deriving a prediction on
poorly or not measured neutrino observables. What distinguishes our work from
previous studies is that we do not assign Peccei-Quinn charges on visible
sector fields so that the ${\bf 10}$ scalar field and its complex conjugate
both have Yukawa couplings with ${\bf 16}$ matter fields. From the fitting of
neutrino oscillation data, we find that not only the normal neutrino mass
hierarchy, but also the inverted hierarchy can be realized. We also reveal that
in the normal hierarchy case, the Dirac CP phase of the neutrino mixing matrix
$\delta_{CP}$ is likely in the ranges of $-2.4<\delta_{\rm CP}<-1.2$ and
$1.2<\delta_{\rm CP}<2.4$, and not in the region with $\delta_{\rm CP}\sim\pi$,
and that in the normal hierarchy case, $\theta_{23}$ is likely in the upper
octant and in the range of $0.50\lesssim\sin^2\theta_{23}\lesssim0.55$.

  for Relative Monte-Carlo Multi-Robot Localization",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As mobile robots become more ubiquitous, their deployments grow across use
cases where GNSS positioning is either unavailable or unreliable. This has led
to increased interest in multi-modal relative localization methods.
Complementing onboard odometry, ranging allows for relative state estimation,
with ultra-wideband (UWB) ranging having gained widespread recognition due to
its low cost and centimeter-level out-of-box accuracy. Infrastructure-free
localization methods allow for more dynamic, ad-hoc, and flexible deployments,
yet they have received less attention from the research community. In this
work, we propose a cooperative relative multi-robot localization where we
leverage inter-robot ranging and simultaneous spatial detections of objects in
the environment. To achieve this, we equip robots with a single UWB transceiver
and a stereo camera. We propose a novel Monte-Carlo approach to estimate
relative states by either employing only UWB ranges or dynamically integrating
simultaneous spatial detections from the stereo cameras. We also address the
challenges for UWB ranging error mitigation, especially in non-line-of-sight,
with a study on different LSTM networks to estimate the ranging error. The
proposed approach has multiple benefits. First, we show that a single range is
enough to estimate the accurate relative states of two robots when fusing
odometry measurements. Second, our experiments also demonstrate that our
approach surpasses traditional methods such as multilateration in terms of
accuracy. Third, to increase accuracy even further, we allow for the
integration of cooperative spatial detections. Finally, we show how ROS 2 and
Zenoh can be integrated to build a scalable wireless communication solution for
multi-robot systems. The experimental validation includes real-time deployment
and autonomous navigation based on the relative positioning method.

graphene matrix and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MW-CNTs). Microstructural
changes directed by graphene substrate in KxSe cathode are contrasted with
graphene-free cathode. Graphene's binding affinity for long-chain polyselenides
(Se-Se-Se = -2.82 eV and Se-Se = -2.646 eV) and ability to induce reactivity
between Se and K are investigated. Furthermore, intercalation voltage for
graphene enclosed KxSe cathode reaction intermediates are calculated with K2Se
as the final discharged product. Our results indicate a single-step reaction
near a voltage of 1.55 V between K and Se cathode. Our findings suggest that
operating at higher voltages (~2V) could result in the formation of reaction
intermediates where intercalation/deintercalation of K could be a challenge,
and therefore cause irreversible capacity losses in the battery. Primary issues
are the high binding energy of long-chain polyselenides with graphene that
discourage K storage and Se-Se bond dissociation at low K concentrations. A
comparison with graphene-free cathode highlights the substantial changes a van

that provides both ride-sourcing services and intracity parcel delivery
services over a transportation network utilizing the idle time of ride-sourcing
drivers. Specifically, the integrated platform simultaneously offers on-demand
ride-sourcing services for passengers and multiple modes of parcel delivery
services for customers, including: (1) on-demand delivery, where drivers
immediately pick up and deliver parcels upon receiving a delivery request; and
(2) flexible delivery, where drivers can pick up (or drop off) parcels only
when they are idle and waiting for the next ride-sourcing request. A
continuous-time Markov Chain (CTMC) model is proposed to characterize the
status change of drivers under joint movement of passengers and parcels over
the transportation network with limited vehicle capacity, where the service
quality of ride-sourcing services, on-demand delivery services, and flexible
delivery services are rigorously quantified. Building on the CTMC model,
incentives for ride-sourcing passengers, delivery customers, drivers, and the
platform are captured through an economic equilibrium model, and the optimal
operational decisions of the platform are derived by solving a non-convex
profit-maximizing problem. We prove the well-posedness of the model and develop
a tailored algorithm to compute the optimal decisions of the platform at an
accelerated speed. Furthermore, we validate the proposed model in a
comprehensive case study for San Francisco, demonstrating that joint management
of ride-sourcing services and intracity package delivery services can lead to a
Pareto improvement that benefits all stakeholders in the integrated

content, network structure) to improve the detection of deceptive bots.
Furthermore, BotMoE incorporates a community-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
layer to improve domain generalization and adapt to different Twitter
communities. Specifically, BotMoE constructs modal-specific encoders for
metadata features, textual content, and graphical structure, which jointly
model Twitter users from three modal-specific perspectives. We then employ a
community-aware MoE layer to automatically assign users to different
communities and leverage the corresponding expert networks. Finally, user
representations from metadata, text, and graph perspectives are fused with an
expert fusion layer, combining all three modalities while measuring the
consistency of user information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BotMoE
significantly advances the state-of-the-art on three Twitter bot detection
benchmarks. Studies also confirm that BotMoE captures advanced and evasive
bots, alleviates the reliance on training data, and better generalizes to new
and previously unseen user communities.

formal method to ensure safety in single-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL), it
results in conservative behaviors when scaling to multi-agent scenarios.
Additionally, it poses computational challenges for synthesizing shields in
complex multi-agent environments. This work introduces Model-based Dynamic
Shielding (MBDS) to support MARL algorithm design. Our algorithm synthesizes
distributive shields, which are reactive systems running in parallel with each
MARL agent, to monitor and rectify unsafe behaviors. The shields can
dynamically split, merge, and recompute based on agents' states. This design
enables efficient synthesis of shields to monitor agents in complex
environments without coordination overheads. We also propose an algorithm to
synthesize shields without prior knowledge of the dynamics model. The proposed
algorithm obtains an approximate world model by interacting with the
environment during the early stage of exploration, making our MBDS enjoy formal
safety guarantees with high probability. We demonstrate in simulations that our
framework can surpass existing baselines in terms of safety guarantees and
learning performance.

the magnetic structures with different magnetic anisotropy, and a higher order
partial spectrum is required in general to characterize detailed magnetic

partial spectrum and evaluate the discrimination performance for different
magnetic structures, mainly focusing on the difference in magnetic symmetry.
The modified partial spectra that are defined not to reflect the difference of
magnetic anisotropy are also useful in evaluating magnetic structures obtained
from first-principles calculations without spin-orbit coupling. We apply the
present method to the symmetry-classified magnetic structures for the crystals

on the wind speed (= 5-25 m/s), particle diameter dp (= 0.025-0.9 mm) and angle

pressure difference between the suction/pressure sides of the blade-airfoil,
advancing the boundary layer separation, and strengthening the recirculation

vision-language learning paradigm to jointly learn vision-language alignment
between encoded ECG images and ECG diagnosis reports. Encoding ECG into images
can result in an efficient ECG retrieval system, which will be highly practical

polarization signal is coincident with a region of cold dust observed in the
southeastern shell and in the unshocked central ejecta. The highly polarized
far-IR emission implies the grains are large (greater than 0.14 microns) and
silicate-dominated. The polarization level varies across the SNR, with an
inverse correlation between the polarization degree and the intensity and
smaller polarization angle dispersion for brighter SNR emission. Stronger
polarization is detected between the bright structures. This may result from a
higher collision rate between the gas and dust producing a lower grain
alignment efficiency where the gas density is higher. We use the dust emission
to provide an estimate of the magnetic field strength in Cas A using the
Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method. The high polarization level is direct
evidence that grains are highly elongated and strongly aligned with the
magnetic field of the SNR. The dust mass from the polarized region is

investigate the robustness of the estimated age and convective core
overshooting for a system with both stars on the main sequence (MS). [...] We
adopt the SCEPtER pipeline, based on grids of stellar models computed for a
different initial chemical composition and convective core overshooting
efficiency. The base fit suggests a common age of $3.02 \pm 0.15$ Gyr, in
agreement with recent literature. This estimated convective core overshooting
parameter is $\beta = 0.09 \pm 0.01$, with a corresponding convective core mass
$M_c = 0.059^{+0.017}_{-0.021}$ $M_{\odot}$. The robustness of these estimates
were tested assuming a narrow constraint on the helium-to-metal enrichment
ratio. The chemical solution of the system changes, but the age and the
overshooting parameter are almost unchanged ($3.08^{+0.17}_{-0.14}$ Gyr and
$0.09 \pm 0.01$). In a further test, we halved the uncertainty as to the
effective temperature of both stars and again the estimated parameter shows
only small variations ($3.02 \pm 0.12$ Gyr and $0.09 \pm 0.01$). This low
variability suggests that the age of the system with both stars in the MS can
be reliably estimated at a 5\% level, but it also indicates that the power of
the investigation is probably low. [...] Despite the great increase in the
observational constraints' precision, the results support the conclusions of
previous theoretical works on the stellar parameter calibration with double MS
star binary systems.

characteristic class in the mathematical structure of fiber bundles associated
with the Bloch wavefunctions. For example, the celebrated Chern number and its
variants belong to the Chern class, characterizing topological charges for
complex Bloch wavefunctions. Nevertheless, under the space-time inversion
symmetry, Bloch wavefunctions can be purely real in the entire momentum space;
consequently, their topological classification does not fall into the Chern

class. Here, in a three-dimensional acoustic crystal, we demonstrate a
topological nodal-line semimetal that is characterized by a doublet of
topological charges, the first and second Stiefel-Whitney numbers,
simultaneously. Such a doubly charged nodal line gives rise to a doubled
bulk-boundary correspondence: while the first Stiefel-Whitney number induces
ordinary drumhead states of the nodal line, the second Stiefel-Whitney number
supports hinge Fermi arc states at odd inversion-related pairs of hinges. These

benefits from the learnability, the core of channel pruning, for constructing

introducing dark sector particles. In this work, we perform a Bayesian global
analysis that includes the latest cosmic shear measurement from the DES
three-year survey and the Planck CMB and BAO data. In the early Universe, the
mirror baryon and mirror radiation behave as dark matter and dark radiation,
and their presence modifies the Universe's expansion history. Additionally, the
scattering between mirror baryon and photon generates the dark acoustic
oscillation process, suppressing the matter power spectrum from the cosmic
shear measurement. We demonstrate how current data constrain these corrections
to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and find that for a viable solution to the little
hierarchy problem, the proportion of MTH dark matter cannot exceed about $30\%$
of the total dark matter density, unless the temperature of twin photon is less
than $30\%$ of that of the standard model photon. While the MTH model is
presently not a superior solution to the observed $H_0$ tension compared to the
$\Lambda$CDM+$\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ model, we demonstrate that it has the
potential to alleviate both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, especially if the
$S_8$ tension persists in the future and approaches the result reported by the
Planck SZ (2013) analysis. In this case, the MTH model can relax the tensions
while satisfying the DES power spectrum constraint up to $k \lesssim 10~h\rm
{Mpc}^{-1}$. If the MTH model is indeed accountable for the $S_8$ and $H_0$

limited data has emerged as a promising technique to achieve personalized user
experiences on edge devices. However, existing FSL methods primarily assume
independent and identically distributed (IID) data and utilize either
computational backpropagation updates for each task or a common model with
task-specific prototypes. Unfortunately, the former solution is infeasible for
edge devices that lack on-device backpropagation capabilities, while the latter
often struggles with limited generalization ability, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This paper proposes a lightweight,
plug-and-play FSL module called Task-aware Normalization (TANO) that enables
efficient and task-aware adaptation of a deep neural network without
backpropagation. TANO covers the properties of multiple user groups by
coordinating the updates of several groups of the normalization statistics
during meta-training and automatically identifies the appropriate normalization
group for a downstream few-shot task. Consequently, TANO provides stable but
task-specific estimations of the normalization statistics to close the
distribution gaps and achieve efficient model adaptation. Results on both
intra-domain and out-of-domain generalization experiments demonstrate that TANO
outperforms recent methods in terms of accuracy, inference speed, and model
size. Moreover, TANO achieves promising results on widely-used FSL benchmarks

a low cost. In oil and gas production, virtual flow metering (VFM) is a popular
soft-sensor that attempts to estimate multiphase flow rates in real time. VFMs
are based on models, and these models require calibration. The calibration is
highly dependent on the application, both due to the great diversity of the
models, and in the available measurements. The most accurate calibration is
achieved by careful tuning of the VFM parameters to well tests, but this can be
work intensive, and not all wells have frequent well test data available. This
paper presents a calibration method based on the measurement provided by the
production separator, and the assumption that the observed flow should be equal
to the sum of flow rates from each individual well. This allows us to jointly
calibrate the VFMs continuously. The method applies Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) to infer a tuning factor and the flow composition for each well. The
method is tested on a case with ten wells, using both synthetic and real data.
The results are promising and the method is able to provide reasonable
estimates of the parameters without relying on well tests. However, some
challenges are identified and discussed, particularly related to the process
noise and how to manage varying data quality.

parameterization depends on the planetary intrinsic temperature (T$_{int}$ ),
we thus evaluate how the increase of this parameter to values higher than those
typically used ($\sim$100K) impacts the atmospheric structure and composition.
Our investigation demonstrates that despite the strong impact of T$_{int}$ on
the chemical composition of the deep atmosphere, the upper atmosphere is not
affected for T$_{eq}$ $>$ 1300 K owing to high altitude quench levels at these
conditions. Below this threshold, however, the larger atmospheric temperatures
produced by increasing T$_{int}$ affect the quenched chemical composition. Our
parameterization depends on two parameters, the eddy magnitude at the
radiative-convective boundary (K$_0$) and the corresponding magnitude at the
homopause (K$_{top}$). We demonstrate that, when using common K$_0$ and
K$_{top}$ values among most of the different planet cases studied, we derive
transit spectra consistent with Hubble Space Telescope observations. Moreover,
our simulations show that increasing the eddy profile enhances the
photochemical production of haze particles and reduces their average radius,
thus providing a steeper UV-Visible slope. Finally, we demonstrate for WASP-39b

lower bounds for problems, meaning there is a family of pathological inputs on

solved much more efficiently, giving rise to the notion of universally optimal
algorithms, which run as fast as possible on every input. Questions on the
existence of universally optimal algorithms were first raised by Garay, Kutten,

series of works, including the influential work of Haeupler, Wajc, and Zuzic in
STOC '21, which resolves some of these decades-old questions in the supported
CONGEST model.
  We work in the HYBRID distributed model, which analyzes networks combining
both global and local communication. Much attention has recently been devoted
to solving distance related problems, such as All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP)
in HYBRID, culminating in a $\tilde \Theta(n^{1/2})$ round algorithm for exact
APSP. However, by definition, every problem in HYBRID is solvable in $D$
(diameter) rounds, showing that it is far from universally optimal.
  We show the first universally optimal algorithms in HYBRID, by presenting a
fundamental tool that solves any broadcasting problem in a universally optimal
number of rounds, deterministically. Specifically, we consider the problem in a
graph $G$ where a set of $k$ messages $M$ distributed arbitrarily across $G$,
requires every node to learn all of $M$. We show a universal lower bound and a
matching, deterministic upper bound, for any graph $G$, any value $k$, and any
distribution of $M$ across $G$.
  This broadcasting tool opens a new exciting direction of research into

the metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) capacitor. We measured two types of GSSCs,
one with thermal annealing treatments (w-a) and one without (wo-a). It was
found that the wo-a GSSC exhibits a two-step feature in the phase versus
forward bias voltage relationship, which may be attributed to the presence of
polymethyl methacrylate residues. By considering the capacitance of the MOS

Brain-computer interface (BCI) system for rehabilitation or prosthesis devices.
Surface electroencephalogram (EEG) signal has been widely utilized for MKD.
However, kinematic decoding from cortical sources is sparsely explored. In this
work, the feasibility of hand kinematics decoding using EEG cortical source
signals has been explored for grasp and lift task. In particular, pre-movement
EEG segment is utilized. A residual convolutional neural network (CNN) - long

utilizes motor neural information present in pre-movement brain activity.
Various EEG windows at 50 ms prior to movement onset, are utilized for hand
kinematics decoding. Correlation value (CV) between actual and predicted hand

performance of the proposed deep learning model is compared in sensor and

  (1) We construct a notion we term time-dependent signatures assuming one-way
functions. In this setting, the signature of a message depends on the time it
is signed and, as a result, the verification procedure depends on the time that
the signature is received. The keys are classical but the verification key

Our scheme can be made secure against adversaries with arbitrarily large
quantum memories by increasing the size of the transmissions sufficiently,

size of the plaintext quantum messages.

to a heating-cooling transition beyond a thermal magic twist angle, facilitated
by twist-induced photonic topological transitions. The underlying mechanism is
related to the spectrum match and mismatch caused by the cooperation between
the non-reciprocal nature of drifted plasmon polaritons and their topological

radiative energy flux under large twist angles. The near-field radiation
becomes thermal insulating when increasing to a critical distance, and
subsequently reverses the radiative flux to increase the cooling power as the
distance increases further. Our results indicate the promising future of
nonequilibrium drifted and twisted devices and pave the way towards tunable

high-value cryptocurrency accounts. There is a strong demand for automated,
efficient, and comprehensive methods to detect security vulnerabilities in a

for smart contracts, the existing proposals do not address the increasing
complexity of contracts. Existing analysis tools suffer from false alarms and
missed bugs in today's smart contracts that are increasingly defined by
complexity and interdependencies. To scale accurate analysis to modern smart
contracts, we introduce EF/CF, a high-performance fuzzer for Ethereum smart
contracts. In contrast to previous work, EF/CF efficiently and accurately
models complex smart contract interactions, such as reentrancy and
cross-contract interactions, at a very high fuzzing throughput rate. To achieve
this, EF/CF transpiles smart contract bytecode into native C++ code, thereby
enabling the reuse of existing, optimized fuzzing toolchains. Furthermore,
EF/CF increases fuzzing efficiency by employing a structure-aware mutation
engine for smart contract transaction sequences and using a contract's ABI to
generate valid transaction inputs. In a comprehensive evaluation, we show that
EF/CF scales better -- without compromising accuracy -- to complex contracts
compared to state-of-the-art approaches, including other fuzzers,
symbolic/concolic execution, and hybrid approaches. Moreover, we show that
EF/CF can automatically generate transaction sequences that exploit reentrancy
bugs to steal Ether.

a set of RGB images that capture a target 3D object in different articulated

category-agnostic manner and it consists of a motion-aware multi-view analysis
phase including pose, depth, and motion estimations, followed by interior plane
detection in images and 3D space, and finally multi-view plane fusion. In

and even extrapolate the captured motions on the target 3D object. We evaluate
our method by quantitative and qualitative comparisons to baselines and

The clouds' atomic hydrogen column densities, $N_{\mathrm{HI}}$, are less than
a $\mbox{few}\times 10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$, but the two clouds closest to the
Galactic Centre nonetheless have detectable CO emission. This implies the
presence of H$_{2}$ at levels of $N_{\mathrm{HI}}$ at least a factor of ten
lower than in the typical Galactic interstellar medium. For the cloud closest
to the Galactic Centre, there is little correlation between the
$N_{\mathrm{HI}}$ and the probability that it will harbour detectable CO
emissions. In contrast, for the intermediate cloud, detectable CO is heavily
biased toward the highest values of $N_{\mathrm{HI}}$. The cloud most distant
from the Galactic Centre has no detectable CO at similar $N_{\mathrm{HI}}$
values. Moreover, we find that the two clouds with detectable CO are too

Here, we provide a detailed study of the target search process for

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Traditional benchmarks, which rely on
artificial datasets, may not accurately represent human-level capabilities. In
this paper, we introduce AGIEval, a novel benchmark specifically designed to
assess foundation model in the context of human-centric standardized exams,
such as college entrance exams, law school admission tests, math competitions,
and lawyer qualification tests. We evaluate several state-of-the-art foundation
models, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and Text-Davinci-003, using this benchmark.
Impressively, GPT-4 surpasses average human performance on SAT, LSAT, and math
competitions, attaining a 95% accuracy rate on the SAT Math test and a 92.5%
accuracy on the English test of the Chinese national college entrance exam.
This demonstrates the extraordinary performance of contemporary foundation
models. In contrast, we also find that GPT-4 is less proficient in tasks that
require complex reasoning or specific domain knowledge. Our comprehensive
analyses of model capabilities (understanding, knowledge, reasoning, and
calculation) reveal these models' strengths and limitations, providing valuable
insights into future directions for enhancing their general capabilities. By
concentrating on tasks pertinent to human cognition and decision-making, our
benchmark delivers a more meaningful and robust evaluation of foundation
models' performance in real-world scenarios. The data, code, and all model
outputs are released in https://github.com/microsoft/AGIEval.

stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) they generate in the frequency
band of LISA. We account for the faint and distant binaries, which contribute
the most to the SGWB, by extending the merger rate at high redshift assuming it
tracks the star formation rate. We adopt different methods to compute the SGWB
signal: an analytical evaluation, Monte Carlo sums over SOBBH population
realisations, and a method that accounts for the role of the detector by
simulating LISA data and iteratively removing resolvable signals until only the
confusion noise is left, allowing for the extraction of both the expected SGWB
and the number of resolvable SOBBHs. Since the latter are few for SNR
thresholds larger than five, we confirm that the spectral shape of the SGWB in
the LISA band follows the analytical prediction of a power law. We infer the
probability distribution of the SGWB amplitude from the LVK GWTC-3 posterior of
the binary population model; its interquartile range of
$h^2\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(f=3\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{Hz}) \in
[5.65,\,11.5]\times10^{-13}$ is in agreement with most previous estimates. We
perform a MC analysis to assess LISA's capability to detect and characterise
this signal. Accounting for both the instrumental noise and the galactic
binaries foreground, with four years of data, LISA will be able to detect the
SOBBH SGWB with percent accuracy, narrowing down the uncertainty on the
amplitude by one order of magnitude with respect to the range of possible

are retrieved from memory. However, most current network approaches use
pairwise links to represent memory recall patterns. Pairwise connections
neglect higher-order associations, i.e. relationships between more than two
concepts at a time. These higher-order interactions might covariate with (and
thus contain information about) how similar concepts are along psycholinguistic
dimensions like arousal, valence, familiarity, gender and others. We overcome
these limits by introducing feature-rich cognitive hypergraphs as quantitative
models of human memory where: (i) concepts recalled together can all engage in
hyperlinks involving also more than two concepts at once (cognitive hypergraph
aspect), and (ii) each concept is endowed with a vector of psycholinguistic
features (feature-rich aspect). We build hypergraphs from word association data
and use evaluation methods from machine learning features to predict concept
concreteness. Since concepts with similar concreteness tend to cluster together
in human memory, we expect to be able to leverage this structure. Using word
association data from the Small World of Words dataset, we compared a pairwise
network and a hypergraph with N=3586 concepts/nodes. Interpretable artificial
intelligence models trained on (1) psycholinguistic features only, (2)

show significant differences between pairwise and hypergraph links.
Specifically, our results show that higher-order and feature-rich hypergraph

storage of models. On the other hand, the shared knowledge learned by jointly

Based on the performance models, PowerFlow dynamically allocates GPUs and
adjusts the GPU-level or job-level configurations of DL training jobs.
PowerFlow applies network packing and buddy allocation to job placement, thus
avoiding extra energy consumed by cluster fragmentations. Evaluation results
show that under the same energy consumption, PowerFlow improves the average JCT
by 1.57 - 3.39 x at most, compared to competitive baselines.

  HD 142527","Accepted for publication in A&A on 12/04/2023",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The atmospheric composition of planets is determined by the chemistry of the
disks in which they form. Studying the gas-phase molecular composition of disks
thus allows us to infer what the atmospheric composition of forming planets
might be. Recent observations of the IRS 48 disk have shown that (asymmetric)
dust traps can directly impact the observable chemistry, through radial and
vertical transport, and the sublimation of ices. The asymmetric HD 142527 disk
provides another good opportunity to investigate the role of dust traps in
setting the disk's chemical composition. In this work, we use archival ALMA
observations of the HD 142527 disk to obtain an as large as possible molecular
inventory, which allows us to investigate the possible influence of the
asymmetric dust trap on the disk's chemistry. We present the first ALMA
detections of [C I], 13C18O, DCO+, H2CO and additional transition of HCO+ and
CS in this disk. In addition, we have acquired upper limits for non-detected
species such as SO and CH3OH. For the majority of the observed molecules, a
decrement in the emission at the location of the dust trap is found. For the
main CO isotopologues continuum over-subtraction likely causes the observed
asymmetry, while for CS and HCN we propose that the observed asymmetries are
likely due to shadows cast by the misaligned inner disk. As the emission of the
observed molecules is not co-spatial with the dust trap and no SO or CH3OH are
found, thermal sublimation of icy mantles does not appear to play a major role
in changing the gas-phase composition of the outer disk in HD 142527 disk.
Using our observations of 13C18O and DCO+ and a RADMC-3D model, we determine
the CO snowline to be located beyond the dust traps, favouring cold gas-phase
formation of H2CO, rather than the hydrogenation of CO-ice and subsequent
sublimation.

geometrical constraints to the devices and often absorb electromagnetic
radiation in the infrared (IR) region. A powerful alternative is ionic liquid
(IL) gating. This technique only needs a metallic electrode in contact with the
IL and the highest achievable electric field is limited by the electrochemical
interactions of the IL with the environment. Despite the excellent gating
properties, a large number of ILs is hardly exploitable for optical experiments
in the mid-IR region, because they typically suffer from low optical
transparency and degradation in ambient conditions. Here, we report the
realization of two electrolytes based on bromide ILs dissolved in polymethyl
methacrylate (PMMA). We demonstrate that such electrolytes can induce
state-of-the-art charge densities as high as $20\times10^{15}\

in vacuum and in ambient atmosphere after a simple vacuum curing. Furthermore,
our electrolytes can be spin coated into flat thin films with optical
transparency in the range from 600 cm$^{-1}$ to 4000 cm$^{-1}$. Thanks to these
properties, the electrolytes are excellent candidates to fill the gap as
versatile gating layers for electronic and mid-IR optoelectronic devices.

to fight infection, which can lead to death without proper and immediate
treatment. Therefore, early diagnosis and medical treatment of sepsis in
critically ill populations at high risk for sepsis and sepsis-associated
mortality are vital to providing the patient with rapid therapy. Studies show
that advancing sepsis detection by 6 hours leads to earlier administration of
antibiotics, which is associated with improved mortality. However, clinical
scores like Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) are not applicable for
early prediction, while machine learning algorithms can help capture the
progressing pattern for early prediction. Therefore, we aim to develop a
machine learning algorithm that predicts sepsis onset 6 hours before it is
suspected clinically. Although some machine learning algorithms have been
applied to sepsis prediction, many of them did not consider the fact that six
hours is not a small gap. To overcome this big gap challenge, we explore a
multi-subset approach in which the likelihood of sepsis occurring earlier than
6 hours is output from a previous subset and feed to the target subset as
additional features. Moreover, we use the hourly sampled data like vital signs
in an observation window to derive a temporal change trend to further assist,
which however is often ignored by previous studies. Our empirical study shows
that both the multi-subset approach to alleviating the 6-hour gap and the added
temporal trend features can help improve the performance of sepsis-related
early prediction.

image classification (HIC) task. Different from prior HIC methods, our
hierarchical prompting is the first to explicitly inject ancestor-class
information as a tokenized hint that benefits the descendant-class
discrimination. We think it well imitates human visual recognition, i.e.,
humans may use the ancestor class as a prompt to draw focus on the subtle
differences among descendant classes. We model this prompting mechanism into a
Transformer with Hierarchical Prompting (TransHP). TransHP consists of three
steps: 1) learning a set of prompt tokens to represent the coarse (ancestor)
classes, 2) on-the-fly predicting the coarse class of the input image at an
intermediate block, and 3) injecting the prompt token of the predicted coarse
class into the intermediate feature. Though the parameters of TransHP maintain
the same for all input images, the injected coarse-class prompt conditions
(modifies) the subsequent feature extraction and encourages a dynamic focus on
relatively subtle differences among the descendant classes. Extensive
experiments show that TransHP improves image classification on accuracy (e.g.,
improving ViT-B/16 by +2.83% ImageNet classification accuracy), training data
efficiency (e.g., +12.69% improvement under 10% ImageNet training data), and
model explainability. Moreover, TransHP also performs favorably against prior
HIC methods, showing that TransHP well exploits the hierarchical information.

To address this practical issue, we first propose a new RIS reflection model

grouped fixed errors. The impact of typical HWIs, including frequency mismatch,
PIN diode failures and panel deformation, on RIS beamforming ability are
studied with the theoretical model and are compared with numerical results. The
impact of frequency mismatch are discussed separately for narrow-band and
wide-band beamforming. Finally, useful insights and guidelines on the RIS

Bubble (LSB), its transition forming coherent structures, and associated heat
transfer has been performed on a flat plate for varying free stream turbulence
(fst) between 1.2% to 10.3%. A well-resolved Large Eddy Simulation (LES)
developed in-house is used for the purpose. Flow separation has been induced by
imposing an adverse pressure gradient on the upper boundary of a Cartesian
domain. Isotropic perturbations are introduced at the inlet to mimic grid
turbulence. With an increase of fst, an upstream shift in the mean reattachment
point has been observed while the onset of separation remains almost invariant,
shrinking the bubble length significantly. The transition of the shear layer is
triggered by the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) instability for fst of less than 3.3%,
while Klebanoff modes (Kmodes) dictate the flow transition at fst greater than
6.5%. Further, a mixed mode, i.e., both K-H and K-modes, contribute to the flow
transition at a moderate level of fst, lying between 3.3% and 6.5%. Thus, the
roll-up of the shear layer appears in the second half of the bubble shedding
large-scale vortices that keep their identity far downstream at low fst levels.
On the contrary, the streamwise streaks via K-modes prior to the separation are
found to interact with the LSB, resulting in an earlier breakdown of the shear
layer with abundant small-scale vortices downstream at the moderate to high fst
levels. However, higher surface-normal heat flux is associated with large-scale
energetic coherent vortices.

multimodal models. To do so, we designed a monomodal architecture that
considers the current state of research on monomodal crowd counting. In
addition, several multimodal architectures have been developed using different
multimodal learning strategies. The key components of the monomodal
architecture are also used in the multimodal architectures to be able to answer
whether multimodal models perform better in crowd counting in general.
Surprisingly, no general answer to this question can be derived from the
existing datasets. We found that the existing datasets hold a bias toward
thermal images. This was determined by analyzing the relationship between the
brightness of optical images and crowd count as well as examining the
annotations made for each dataset. Since answering this question is important
for future real-world applications of crowd counting, this paper establishes
criteria for a potential dataset suitable for answering whether multimodal
models perform better in crowd counting in general.

markers. The region containing the S locus was restricted to an 4 M bp window
on chromosome 5. Among the genes predicted in this region, MDIS1 INTERACTING
RECEPTOR LIKE KINASE 2 (MIK2) was promising as a candidate for SSI. Its
ortholog in Arabidopsis is involved in pollen stigma recognition reactions, and
its protein structure is similar to that of S-receptor kinase (SRK), a key
component of the SSI in the Brassica genus. The sequencing of MIK2 in chicory
and endive accessions revealed two contrasting scenarios. In C. endivia, MIK2
was fully conserved even comparing different botanical varieties (smooth and
curly). In C. intybus, 387 SNPs and 3 INDELs were identified when comparing
accessions of different biotypes from the same botanical variety (radicchio).
The SNP distribution throughout the gene was uneven, with hypervariable domains
preferentially localized in the LRR-rich extracellular region, putatively
identified as the receptor domain. The gene was hypothesized to be under
positive selection, as the nonsynonymous mutations were more than double the
synonymous ones (dN / dS = 2.17). An analogous situation was observed analyzing
the first 500 bp of the MIK2 promoter: no SNPs were observed among the endive
samples, whereas 44 SNPs and 6 INDELs were detected among the chicory samples.
Further analyses are needed to confirm the role of MIK2 in SSI and to
demonstrate whether the 23 species-specific nonsynonymous SNPs in the CDS
and/or the species-specific 10 bp INDEL found in a CCAAT box region of the
promoter are responsible for the contrasting sexual behaviors of the two

emerge as the dominant solution to solve this issue. Despite encouraging
progress, they remain non-optimal, as the unique properties (e.g., motion
style, rhythm) of a specific sequence cannot be adapted. More generally, at
test-time, once encountering unseen motion categories (out-of-distribution),
the predicted poses tend to be unreliable. Motivated by this observation, we
propose a novel test-time adaptation framework that leverages two
self-supervised auxiliary tasks to help the primary forecasting network adapt
to the test sequence. In the testing phase, our model can adjust the model
parameters by several gradient updates to improve the generation quality.
However, due to catastrophic forgetting, both auxiliary tasks typically tend to
the low ability to automatically present the desired positive incentives for

introduce delays of a stochastic nature that degrade the performance of
centralised control algorithms. Therefore, controllers for oscillation damping
may not operate correctly unless the communication channel characteristics are
not considered and compensated. In this paper, a centralised controller is
proposed for the oscillation damping that uses a PV plant with all the
realistic effects of communication channels taken into consideration. The
communication channels are modelled based on measurements taken in a laboratory
environment. The controller is designed to damp several modes of oscillation by
using the open-loop phase shift compensation. Theoretical developments were
validated in a laboratory using four converters acting as two PV inverters, a
battery and a STATCOM. A real-time processing platform was used to implement
the centralised controller and to deploy the communication infrastructure.
Experimental results show the communication channels impose severe restrictions
on the performance of centralised POD controllers, highlighting the importance

  dots for efficient photoelectrocatalytic oxygen evolution",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-doping can not only suppress the photogenerated charge recombination of
semiconducting quantum dots by self-introducing trapping states within the
bandgap, but also provide high-density catalytic active sites as the
consequence of abundant non-saturated bonds associated with the defects. Here,
we successfully prepared semiconducting copper selenide (CuSe) confined quantum
dots with abundant vacancies and systematically investigated their
photoelectrochemical characteristics. Photoluminescence characterizations
reveal that the presence of vacancies reduces the emission intensity
dramatically, indicating a low recombination rate of photogenerated charge
carriers due to the self-introduced trapping states within the bandgap. In
addition, the ultra-low charge transfer resistance measured by electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy implies the efficient charge transfer of CuSe
semiconducting quantum dots-based photoelectrocatalysts, which is guaranteed by
the high conductivity of their confined structure as revealed by
room-temperature electrical transport measurements. Such high conductivity and
low photogenerated charge carriers recombination rate, combined with
high-density active sites and confined structure, guaranteeing the remarkable
photoelectrocatalytic performance and stability as manifested by
photoelectrocatalysis characterizations. This work promotes the development of
semiconducting quantum dots-based photoelectrocatalysis and demonstrates CuSe
semiconducting quantum confined catalysts as an advanced photoelectrocatalysts

it has been recently suggested that the presence of spacetime torsion could
solve problems of the very early and the late-time universe undergoing
accelerating phases. In this paper, we use the latest observations of
high-redshift data, coming from multiple measurements of quasars and baryon
acoustic oscillations, to phenomenologically constrain such cosmological model
in the framework of Einstein-Cartan (EC) endowed with spacetime torsion. Such
newly compiled quasar datasets in the cosmological analysis is crucial to this
aim, since it will extend the Hubble diagram to high-redshift range in which
predictions from different cosmologies can be distinguished. Our results show
that out of all the candidate models, the torsion plus cosmological constant
model is strongly favoured by the current high-redshift data, where torsion
itself would be expected to yield the current cosmic acceleration. Specially,
in the framework of Friedmann-like cosmology with torsion, the determined
Hubble constant is in very good agreement with that derived from the Planck
2018 CMB results. On the other hand, our results are compatible with zero
spatial curvature and there is no significant deviation from flat spatial
hypersurfaces. Finally, we check the robustness of high-redshift observations
by placing constraints on the torsion parameter $\alpha$, which is strongly
consistent with other recent works focusing on torsion effect on the primordial
helium-4 abundance.

method was referred as the liquid source rich low Tmax (LS+LTmax) growth method
which combines the advantage of Top Seeded Infiltration Growth (TSIG) into Top
Seeded Melt-texture Growth (TSMG). The LS+LTmax method synergistically
regulates the perfect appearance and high superconducting performance in REBCO
single grains. The complementary role of liquid source and low Tmax on the
crystallization has been carefully investigated. Microstructure analysis
demonstrates that the LS+LTmax processed GdBCO single grains show clear
advantages of uniform distribution of RE3+ ions as well as RE211 particles. The
inhibition of Gd211 coarsening leads to improved pining properties. GdBCO
single-grain superconductors with diameter of 18 mm and 25 mm show maximum
trapped magnetic field of 0.746 T and 1.140 T at 77 K. These trapped fields are
significantly higher than those of conventional TSMG samples. Particularly, at
grain boundaries with reduced RE211 density superior flux pinning performance
has been observed. It indicates the existence of multiple pinning mechanisms at

biological systems such as the heart; however, it is unclear how noise affects

two-dimensional mathematical model of human AF and explore how Gaussian white
noise affects the instability of spiral waves. In homogeneous tissue models,
Gaussian white noise may lead to spiral-wave meandering and wavefront break-up.
As the noise intensity increases, the spatial dispersion of phase singularity
(PS) points increases. This finding indicates the potential AF-protective
effects of cardiac system stochasticity by destabilizing the rotors. However,
Gaussian white noise is unlikely to affect the spiral-wave instability in the
presence of localized scar or fibrosis regions. The PS points are located at
the boundary or inside the scar/fibrosis regions. Localized scarring or
fibrosis may play a pivotal role in stabilizing spiral waves regardless of the

paradigms to achieve unprecedented performance. Approximate Computing (AC),
which relies on the ability of applications to tolerate some error in the
results to trade-off accuracy for performance, has shown significant promise.
Despite the success of AC in domains such as Machine Learning, its acceptance
in High-Performance Computing (HPC) is limited due to stringent requirements
for accuracy. We need tools and techniques to identify regions of code that are
amenable to approximations and their impact on the application output quality
to guide developers to employ selective approximation. To this end, we propose
CHEF-FP, a flexible, scalable, and easy-to-use source-code transformation tool
based on Automatic Differentiation (AD) for analyzing approximation errors in
HPC applications. CHEF-FP uses Clad, an efficient AD tool built as a plugin to
the Clang compiler and based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure, as a backend
and utilizes its AD abilities to evaluate approximation errors in C++ code.
CHEF-FP works at the source by injecting error estimation code into the
generated adjoints. This enables the error-estimation code to undergo compiler
optimizations resulting in improved analysis time and reduced memory usage. We
also provide theoretical and architectural augmentations to source code
transformation-based AD tools to perform FP error analysis. This paper
primarily focuses on analyzing errors introduced by mixed-precision AC
techniques. We also show the applicability of our tool in estimating other
kinds of errors by evaluating our tool on codes that use approximate functions.
Moreover, we demonstrate the speedups CHEF-FP achieved during analysis time
compared to the existing state-of-the-art tool due to its ability to generate
and insert approximation error estimate code directly into the derivative
source.

climatic factors and plant characteristics. To shed new light on the complex
relationships between plant characteristics and fire regimes, we developed a
new conceptual, mechanistic model that includes plant competition, stochastic
fires, and fire-vegetation feedback. Considering a single standing plant
functional type, we observed that highly flammable and slowly colonizing plants
can persist only when they have a strong fire response, while fast colonizing
and less flammable plants can display a larger range of fire responses. At the
community level, the fire response of the strongest competitor determines the
existence of alternative ecological states, i.e. different plant communities,
under the same environmental conditions. Specifically, when the strongest
competitor had a very strong fire response, such as in Mediterranean forests,
only one ecological state could be achieved. Conversely, when the strongest
competitor was poorly fire-adapted, alternative ecological states emerged, for
example between tropical humid savannas and forests, or between different types
of boreal forests. These findings underline the importance of including the
plant fire response when modeling fire ecosystems, e.g. to predict the
vegetation response to invasive species or to climate change.

the novel Spectformer architecture for transformers that combines spectral and

allows the transformer to capture the feature representation appropriately and
it yields improved performance over other transformer representations. For
instance, it improves the top-1 accuracy by 2\% on ImageNet compared to both
GFNet-H and LiT. SpectFormer-S reaches 84.25\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K

its use in downstream tasks such of object detection and instance segmentation

Harish-Chandra module if it is the direct sum of its generalized weight spaces
with respect to $\Gamma$. In 1994, Drozd, Futorny, and Ovsienko defined a
generalization of a central subalgebra called a Harish-Chandra subalgebra and
showed that when $\Gamma$ is a Harish-Chandra subalgebra of $A$ the structure
of Harish-Chandra $A$-modules can be described using information about the
relationship between $A$ and the cofinite maximal ideals of $\Gamma$.
  We extend these results by dropping the assumption that $\Gamma$ is
quasicommutative. We facilitate this by introducing an equivalence relation
$\sim$ on the set $\mathrm{cfs}(\Gamma)$ of cofinite maximal ideals of
$\Gamma$. We define Harish-Chandra block modules with respect to $\sim$ to be
$A$-modules that are the direct sum of so called block spaces corresponding to
the equivalence classes $\mathrm{cfs}(\Gamma)/{\sim}$. If $\Gamma$ is a
Harish-Chandra block subalgebra of $A$ with respect to $\sim$, then the
structure of Harish-Chandra block modules can be described based on the
relationship between $A$ and $\mathrm{cfs}(\Gamma)/{\sim}$. In particular, we
give a decomposition of the category of Harish-Chandra block modules and the
collection of isomorphism classes of irreducible Harish-Chandra block modules.
Furthermore, we define a category $\mathcal{A}$ on
$\mathrm{cfs}(\Gamma)/{\sim}$, and show the category of profinite
$\mathcal{A}$-modules is equivalent to the category of Harish-Chandra block
modules. Taking $\Gamma$ to be noetherian and quasicommutative, and $\sim$ to
be the equality relation, we recover (in fact, a slight refinement of) results
from Drozd, Futorny, and Ovsienko.

principle-based control (TV-IMPC) for tracking sophisticated references
generated by linear time-varying (LTV) autonomous systems. The existing TV-IMPC
design usually requires a complete knowledge of the plant I/O (input/output)
model, leading to the lack of structural robustness. To tackle this issue, we,
in the paper, design a gray-box extended state observer (ESO) to estimate and
compensate unknown model uncertainties and external disturbances. By means of
the ESO feedback, the plant model is kept as nominal, and hence the structural
robustness is achieved for the time-varying internal model. It is shown that
the proposed design has bounded ESO estimation errors, which can be further
adjusted by modifying the corresponding control gains. To stabilize the
ESO-based TV-IMPC, a time-varying stabilizer is developed by employing Linear
Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Extensive simulation and experimental studies are
conducted on a direct-drive servo stage to validate the proposed robust TV-IMPC
with ultra-precision tracking performance ($\sim 60$nm RMSE out of $\pm80$mm
stroke).

nucleosynthesis prescriptions. We consider r-process nucleosynthesis from
merging neutron stars (MNS), magneto-rotational supernovae (MR-SNe) and
s-process synthesis from low- and intermediate- mass stars (LIMS) and rotating
massive stars. The predictions of our model are compared with data from the
sixth data release of the Gaia-ESO survey, from which we consider 62 open
clusters with age > 0.1 Gyr and 1300 Milky Way disc field stars. We conclude
that: i) the [Eu/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] is reproduced by both a prompt and a delayed
source, but the quick source completely dominates the Eu production; ii)
rotation in massive stars contribute substantially to the s-process elements of
the first peak, but MNS and MR-SNe are necessary in order to reproduce the
observations; iii) due to the adopted yields, our model overpredicts Pr and
underpredicts Nd, while the [Mo/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] is nicely reproduced. For the
radial gradients, we conclude that: i) our predicted slope of the [Fe/H]
gradient is in agreement with the one observed in open clusters by Gaia-ESO and
other high-resolution spectroscopic surveys. ii) The predicted slope of the
[Eu/H] radial gradient is steeper than the observed one, independently on how
quick the production of Eu is. We discuss the possible causes of this
discrepancy in terms of both different Galaxy formation scenarios and stellar
radial migration effects. iii) For all the elements belonging to the second
s-process peak (Ba, La, Ce) as well as for Pr, we predict a plateau at low
Galactocentric distances, which is probably due to the enhanced enrichment from
LIMS in the inner regions.

scenario of Super-Resolution (SR) usually needs to super-resolve large input
like 2K to higher resolution (4K/8K). To reduce the computational and memory
cost, current methods first split the large input into local patches and then
merge the SR patches into the output. These methods adaptively allocate a
subnet for each patch. Quantization is a very important technique for network
acceleration and has been used to design the subnets. Current methods train an
MLP bit selector to determine the propoer bit for each layer. However, they
uniformly sample subnets for training, making simple subnets overfitted and
complicated subnets underfitted. Therefore, the trained bit selector fails to
determine the optimal bit. Apart from this, the introduced bit selector brings
additional cost to each layer of the SR network. In this paper, we propose a
novel method named Content-Aware Bit Mapping (CABM), which can remove the bit
selector without any performance loss. CABM also learns a bit selector for each
layer during training. After training, we analyze the relation between the edge
information of an input patch and the bit of each layer. We observe that the
edge information can be an effective metric for the selected bit. Therefore, we
design a strategy to build an Edge-to-Bit lookup table that maps the edge score
of a patch to the bit of each layer during inference. The bit configuration of
SR network can be determined by the lookup tables of all layers. Our strategy
can find better bit configuration, resulting in more efficient mixed precision
networks. We conduct detailed experiments to demonstrate the generalization
ability of our method. The code will be released.

division multiplexing have greatly facilitated high-speed optical

However, coherent mode division multiplexing is quite vulnerable to even minute

we propose and experimentally demonstrate a paradigm shift to incoherent mode
division multiplexing for high-security optical information encryption by
harnessing the degree of coherence of structured random light beams. In
contrast to the conventional techniques, our approach does not require mode
orthogonality to circumnavigate unwanted mode crosstalk. In addition, our

extreme robustness of structured random light to external perturbations, we are
able to achieve highly accurate information encryption and decryption in the

of these two execution models under load from the Renaissance Benchmark Suite.
This research is relevant to anyone interested in understanding the performance
differences between just-in-time compiled code and interpretive execution. It
provides a contemporary assessment of the interpretive JVM core, the entry and

execution. The study considers factors such as the JRE version, the GNU GCC
version used in the JRE build toolchain, and the garbage collector algorithm
specified at runtime, and their impact on the performance difference envelope
between interpretive and tiered execution. Our findings indicate that tiered
execution is considerably more efficient than interpretive execution, and the
performance gap has increased, ranging from 4 to 37 times more efficient. On
average, tiered execution is approximately 15 times more efficient than
interpretive execution. Additionally, the performance differences between
interpretive and tiered execution are influenced by workload category, with
narrower performance differences observed for web-based workloads and more
significant differences for Functional and Scala-type workloads.

(SSL-KD) to boost the representation learning performance of small models. In
this study, we propose a Multi-mode Online Knowledge Distillation method (MOKD)
to boost self-supervised visual representation learning. Different from
existing SSL-KD methods that transfer knowledge from a static pre-trained
teacher to a student, in MOKD, two different models learn collaboratively in a
self-supervised manner. Specifically, MOKD consists of two distillation modes:
self-distillation and cross-distillation modes. Among them, self-distillation
performs self-supervised learning for each model independently, while
cross-distillation realizes knowledge interaction between different models. In
cross-distillation, a cross-attention feature search strategy is proposed to
enhance the semantic feature alignment between different models. As a result,
the two models can absorb knowledge from each other to boost their
representation learning performance. Extensive experimental results on
different backbones and datasets demonstrate that two heterogeneous models can
benefit from MOKD and outperform their independently trained baseline. In
addition, MOKD also outperforms existing SSL-KD methods for both the student
and teacher models.

chemical interactions occurring at the buried sliding interface, which are of
key importance for the improvement of the lubrication performance. Yet, these
tribochemical processes are very difficult to monitor in real time. Ab initio
molecular dynamics simulations are the ideal tool to shed light into such a
complicated reactivity. In this work we perform ab initio simulations, both in

oxidation on the tribochemical reactivity of MoDTC and we find that when the
surfaces are covered by oxygen, the first dissociative steps of the additives
are significantly hindered. Our preliminary tribological tests on oxidized
steel discs support these results. Bare metallic surfaces are necessary for a
stable adsorption of the additives, their quick decomposition, and the
formation of a durable MoS$_2$ tribolayer. This work demonstrates the

severe projection distortion near poles. Current DNN-based SR methods use 2D

presence of ground obstacles, while accounting for wind effects. Under
simplifying model assumptions, in particular neglecting the effect of turns, we
characterize the optimal solution as comprising straight glide segments between
iteratively-determined extreme points on the obstacles. Consequently, the
optimal trajectory is included in an iteratively-defined reduced visibility
graph, and can be obtained by a standard graph search algorithm, such as A$^*$.
We further quantify the effect of turns to verify a safe near-optimal glide

modeling them, whereas statisticians oppositely try to model noise to identify
signals. In this study, we applied the statisticians' concept of signal
detection of physics data with small-size samples and high dimensions without
modeling the signals. Most of the data in nature, whether noises or signals,
are assumed to be generated by dynamical systems; thus, there is essentially no
distinction between these generating processes. We propose that the correlation
length of a dynamical system and the number of samples are crucial for the
practical definition of noise variables among the signal variables generated by
such a system. Since variables with short-term correlations reach normal
distributions faster as the number of samples decreases, they are regarded to
be ``noise-like'' variables, whereas variables with opposite properties are
``signal-like'' variables. Normality tests are not effective for data of
small-size samples with high dimensions. Therefore, we modeled noises on the
basis of the property of a noise variable, that is, the uniformity of the
histogram of the probability that a variable is a noise. We devised a method of
detecting signal variables from the structural change of the histogram
according to the decrease in the number of samples. We applied our method to
the data generated by globally coupled map, which can produce time series data
with different correlation lengths, and also applied to gene expression data,
which are typical static data of small-size samples with high dimensions, and
we successfully detected signal variables from them. Moreover, we verified the

time, while Kempa and Prezza [STOC 2018] have shown that for $k \geq 3$, it is
NP-complete to compute the smallest $k$-attractor by a reduction from $k$-set

  The main result of this paper answers the open question for the complexity of
the 2-attractor problem, showing that the problem remains NP-complete. Kempa
and Prezza's proof for $k \geq 3$ also reduces the 2-attractor problem to the
2-set cover problem, which is equivalent to edge cover, but that does not fully
capture the complexity of the 2-attractor problem. For this reason, we extend
edge cover by a color function on the edges, yielding the colorful edge cover
problem. Any edge cover must then satisfy the additional constraint that each
color is represented. This extension raises the complexity such that colorful
edge cover becomes NP-complete while also more precisely modeling the

promising memristive materials for neuromorphic computing systems as they could
solve the problem of the excessively high energy consumption of conventional
von Neumann computer architectures. Despite extensive experimental work, the
underlying switching mechanisms are still not understood, impeding progress in
material and device functionality. This study reveals the dominant role of
mobile defects in the switching dynamics of 2D TMDC materials. The switching
process is governed by the formation and annihilation dynamics of a local
vacancy depletion zone. Moreover, minor changes in the interface potential
barriers cause fundamentally different device behavior previously thought to
originate from multiple mechanisms. The key mechanisms are identified with a
charge transport model for electrons, holes, and ionic point defects, including
image-charge-induced Schottky barrier lowering (SBL). The model is validated by
comparing simulations to measurements for various 2D MoS$_2$-based devices,
strongly corroborating the relevance of vacancies in TMDC devices and offering
a new perspective on the switching mechanisms. The insights gained from this
study can be used to extend the functional behavior of 2D TMDC memristive
devices in future neuromorphic computing applications.

some simplifying assumptions. We formally define the training-compatible goal
set (the set of goals consistent with the training rewards) and assume that the
trained agent learns a goal from this set. In a setting where the trained agent

values of $\Omega_{m0}$ shift to the larger values in the power-law VDF case
and to the lower values in the exponential VDF case, compared with those
obtained in the non-evolving VDF case. In the $\omega$CDM model, the limits on
$\omega_0$, i.e. the dark energy equation of state (EoS), are consistent with
those from the Pantheon+ sample at 68.3% confidence level, but the mean values
of $\omega_0$ from the former are significantly smaller than those from the
latter. In the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model, the uncertainties on $\omega_0$ are
dramatically enlarged compared with those obtained in the $\omega$CDM model;
moreover, the Markov chains of $\omega_a$, i.e. the time-varying slope of EoS,
do not achieve convergence in the three VDF cases. Overall, the lens-redshift

monolayers show great promise for the future applications in nanoelectronics,
data storage, and sensing. The research in intrinsically magnetic
two-dimensional materials mainly focuses on synthetic iodide and telluride
based compounds, which inherently suffer from the lack of ambient stability. So
far, naturally occurring layered magnetic materials have been vastly
overlooked. These minerals offer a unique opportunity to explore air-stable
complex layered systems with high concentration of local moment bearing ions.
We demonstrate magnetic ordering in iron-rich two-dimensional phyllosilicates,
focusing on mineral species of minnesotaite, annite, and biotite. These are
naturally occurring van der Waals magnetic materials which integrate local
moment baring ions of iron via magnesium/aluminium substitution in their
octahedral sites. Due to self-inherent capping by silicate/aluminate
tetrahedral groups, ultra-thin layers are air-stable. Chemical
characterization, quantitative elemental analysis, and iron oxidation states
were determined via Raman spectroscopy, wavelength disperse X-ray spectroscopy,
X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
Superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry measurements were
performed to examine the magnetic ordering. These layered materials exhibit
paramagnetic or superparamagnetic characteristics at room temperature. At low
temperature ferrimagnetic or antiferromagnetic ordering occurs, with the
critical ordering temperature of 38.7 K for minnesotaite, 36.1 K for annite,
and 4.9 K for biotite. In-field magnetic force microscopy on iron bearing
phyllosilicates confirmed the paramagnetic response at room temperature,

  Long-tailed Distribution",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How to estimate the uncertainty of a given model is a crucial problem.
Current calibration techniques treat different classes equally and thus
implicitly assume that the distribution of training data is balanced, but
ignore the fact that real-world data often follows a long-tailed distribution.
In this paper, we explore the problem of calibrating the model trained from a
long-tailed distribution. Due to the difference between the imbalanced training
distribution and balanced test distribution, existing calibration methods such
as temperature scaling can not generalize well to this problem. Specific
calibration methods for domain adaptation are also not applicable because they
rely on unlabeled target domain instances which are not available. Models
trained from a long-tailed distribution tend to be more overconfident to head
classes. To this end, we propose a novel knowledge-transferring-based
calibration method by estimating the importance weights for samples of tail
classes to realize long-tailed calibration. Our method models the distribution
of each class as a Gaussian distribution and views the source statistics of
head classes as a prior to calibrate the target distributions of tail classes.
We adaptively transfer knowledge from head classes to get the target
probability density of tail classes. The importance weight is estimated by the
ratio of the target probability density over the source probability density.
Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10-LT, MNIST-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, and ImageNet-LT
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

in the thermodynamic limit. We identify two main sources of disorder which need
to be averaged over: the graph ensemble and the set of epidemic individual's
trajectories, from which observations are taken with a fixed protocol. The
dynamics on the contact graph induces non-trivial long-range correlations among
individuals' states. This results in non-local correlated quenched disorder
which unfortunately is typically hard to handle. To overcome this difficulty,
we divide the dynamical process into two sets of variables: a set of stochastic
independent variables (representing the infection delays), plus a set of
correlated variables (the infection times) that depend deterministically on the
first. Treating the former as quenched variables and the latter as dynamic
ones, the disorder average becomes feasible by means of the Replica Symmetric
cavity method. We give theoretical predictions on the posterior probability
distribution of the trajectory of each individual, conditioned on (partial and
noisy) observations on the state of individuals at given times, focusing on the
Susceptible Infected (SI) model. In the Bayes-optimal condition, i.e. when true
dynamic parameters are known, the inference task is expected to fall in the

following: (a) a set of public service centers (e.g., schools); (b) a set of

for all demand unit-service center pairs. In addition, each service center is
also associated with a notion of capacity and a penalty which is incurred if it
gets overloaded. Given the input, the LBDD problem determines a mapping from
the set of demand units to the set of service centers. The objective is to
determine a mapping that minimizes the sum of the following two terms: (i) the
total assignment cost between demand units and their allotted service centers
and, (ii) total of penalties incurred. The problem of LBDD finds its
application in the domain of urban planning. An instance of the LBDD problem
can be reduced to an instance of the min-cost bi-partite matching problem.
However, this approach cannot scale up to the real world large problem
instances. The current state of the art related to LBDD makes simplifying
assumptions such as infinite capacity or total capacity being equal to the
total demand. This paper proposes a novel allotment subspace re-adjustment
based approach (ASRAL) for the LBDD problem. We analyze ASRAL theoretically and
present its asymptotic time complexity. We also evaluate ASRAL experimentally
on large problem instances and compare with alternative approaches. Our results
indicate that ASRAL is able to scale-up while maintaining significantly better
solution quality over the alternative approaches. In addition, we also extend
ASRAL to para-ASRAL which uses the GPU and CPU cores to speed-up the execution
while maintaining the same solution quality as ASRAL.

yields KG-oscillators, the later effectively yields KG-Coulombic particles. We
report on the effects of rainbow gravity on both KG-oscillators and Coulombic
particles using four pairs of rainbow functions: (i) $% g_{_{0}}\left( y\right)

y\right) =1$, $g_{_{1}}\left( y\right) =\sqrt{% 1-\epsilon y}$, (iii)
$g_{_{0}}\left( y\right) =g_{_{1}}\left( y\right) =\left( 1-\epsilon y\right)
^{-1}$, and (iv) $g_{_{0}}\left( y\right) =\left( e^{\epsilon y}-1\right)
/\epsilon y$, $g_{_{1}}\left( y\right) =1$, where $y=|E|/E_p$ and $\epsilon$ is
the rainbow parameter. It is interesting to report that, all KG particles' and
anti-particles' energies are symmetric about $E=0$ value (a natural
relativistic quantum mechanical tendency), and a phenomenon of energy states to
fly away and disappear from the spectrum is observed for the rainbow functions
pair (iii) at $\gamma=\epsilon m/E_p=1$.

transformation invariance is achieved by an invariant data representation
rather than an invariant model architecture, making it applicable to other

city such as the delivery of goods, mapping real-time road traffic and
monitoring pollution. The ability of drones to perform these functions often
requires the support of machine learning technology. However, traditional
machine learning models for drones encounter data privacy problems,
communication costs and energy limitations. Federated Learning, an emerging
distributed machine learning approach, is an excellent solution to address
these issues. Federated learning (FL) allows drones to train local models
without transmitting raw data. However, existing FL requires a central server
to aggregate the trained model parameters of the UAV. A failure of the central
server can significantly impact the overall training. In this paper, we propose
two aggregation methods: Commutative FL and Alternate FL, based on the existing
architecture of decentralised Federated Learning for UAV Networks (DFL-UN) by
adding a unique aggregation method of decentralised FL. Those two methods can
effectively control energy consumption and communication cost by controlling
the number of local training epochs, local communication, and global
communication. The simulation results of the proposed training methods are also
presented to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the architecture compared
with two benchmark methods (e.g. standard machine learning training and
standard single aggregation server training). The simulation results show that
the proposed methods outperform the benchmark methods in terms of operational
stability, energy consumption and communication cost.

culmination of this line of work because the algorithmic techniques used can

  Our main contribution is a new estimator for network unreliability in very

unreliability since the disconnection event is elusive. Our estimator is
obtained by defining an appropriate importance sampling subroutine on a dual
spanning tree packing of the graph. To complement this estimator for very

converter-interfaced generators (CIGs) to participate in grid services such as
power oscillation damping (POD). As power systems are prone to topology changes
because of connection and disconnection of generators and electrical lines, one
of the most important requirements in the POD controller design is to account
for these changes and to deal with them by using either adaptive or robust
approaches. The robust approach is usually preferred by system operators
because of the fixed structure of the controller. In this paper, a procedure to
design POD controllers for CIG-based power plants that takes into consideration
all possible network configurations is presented. This procedure is based on
frequency-response techniques, so it is suitable for the commissioning in newly
installed power plants, even in those cases when a detailed small-signal model
of the system is not available. This procedure can be used to damp critical
system modes by using active power, reactive power, or both power components
simultaneously. The proposed procedure is applied to the design of the POD
controller for a CIG-based power plant connected to the IEEE 39 Bus system.
Simulations performed in Matlab and SimPowerSystems are used to validate the
proposed design procedure.

the sense of the lowest upper error bound. Meanwhile, we find that the proposed
MKC is related to a specific heavy-tail distribution, and the level of the
heavy tail is controlled by the kernel bandwidth solely. Interestingly, this
distribution becomes the Gaussian distribution when the bandwidth is set to be
infinite, which allows one to tackle both Gaussian and non-Gaussian problems.
We propose an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the parameter

our algorithm is equivalent to the traditional linear regression under Gaussian

equivalent to their position in the list, with the option of moving them
towards the head of the list. Sleator and Tarjan introduced the famous ""Move to

head of the list) and showed that it is 2-competitive. While this bound is
excellent, the absolute cost of the algorithm's solution may be very large

cost that is quadratic in the length of the list). Thus, we consider the more

complex manufacturing decision-making problems, especially in a context where
the system learns over time with actual operation in the absence of training

assembly sequence planning (ASP) problem. In this paper, we propose an approach
to the implementation of DRL methods in ASP. The proposed approach introduces
in the RL environment parametric actions to improve training time and sample
efficiency and uses two different reward signals: (1) user's preferences and
(2) total assembly time duration. The user's preferences signal addresses the
difficulties and non-ergonomic properties of the assembly faced by the human
and the total assembly time signal enforces the optimization of the assembly.
Three of the most powerful deep RL methods were studied, Advantage Actor-Critic
(A2C), Deep Q-Learning (DQN), and Rainbow, in two different scenarios: a
stochastic and a deterministic one. Finally, the performance of the DRL
algorithms was compared to tabular Q-Learnings performance. After 10,000
episodes, the system achieved near optimal behaviour for the algorithms tabular
Q-Learning, A2C, and Rainbow. Though, for more complex scenarios, the algorithm
tabular Q-Learning is expected to underperform in comparison to the other 2
algorithms. The results support the potential for the application of deep
reinforcement learning in assembly sequence planning problems with human

  Exploratory Study",,,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Context: Smart contracts are computerized self-executing contracts that
contain clauses, which are enforced once certain conditions are met. Smart
contracts are immutable by design and cannot be modified once deployed, which
ensures trustlessness. Despite smart contracts' immutability benefits,
upgrading contract code is still necessary for bug fixes and potential feature
improvements. In the past few years, the smart contract community introduced
several practices for upgrading smart contracts. Upgradeable contracts are
smart contracts that exhibit these practices and are designed with
upgradeability in mind. During the upgrade process, a new smart contract
version is deployed with the desired modification, and subsequent user requests
will be forwarded to the latest version (upgraded contract). Nevertheless,
little is known about the characteristics of the upgrading practices, how
developers apply them, and how upgrading impacts contract usage.
  Objectives: This paper aims to characterize smart contract upgrading patterns
and analyze their prevalence based on the deployed contracts that exhibit these
patterns. Furthermore, we intend to investigate the reasons why developers
upgrade contracts (e.g., introduce features, fix vulnerabilities) and how
upgrades affect the adoption and life span of a contract in practice.
  Method: We collect deployed smart contracts metadata and source codes to
identify contracts that exhibit certain upgrade patterns (upgradeable
contracts) based on a set of policies. Then we trace smart contract versions
for each upgradable contract and identify the changes in contract versions
using similarity and vulnerabilities detection tools. Finally, we plan to
analyze the impact of upgrading on contract usage based on the number of
transactions received and the lifetime of the contract version.

star-formation process in galaxies. Current ways to calibrate this rate do not
usually employ observational methods accounting for the low-mass end of stellar
populations as their signatures are too weak. Accessing the bulk of
protostellar activity within galactic star-forming regions can be achieved by
tracing signposts of ongoing star formation. One such signpost is molecular
outflows, which are bright in molecular emission. We propose to utilize the
protostellar outflow emission as a tracer of the SFR. In this work, we
introduce a novel version of the galaxy-in-a-box model, which can be used to
relate molecular emission from star formation in galaxies with the SFR. We
measured the predicted para-H2O emission at 988 GHz and corresponding SFRs for
galaxies with LFIR = $10^8$ - $10^{11}$ L$_\odot$ in a distance-independent
manner, and compared them with expectations from observations. We evaluated the
derived results by varying the star formation efficiency, the free-fall time
scaling factor, and the initial mass function. For the chosen H2O transition,
relying on the current Galactic observations and star formation properties, we
are underestimating the total galactic emission, while overestimating the SFRs,
particularly for more starburst-like configurations. The current version of the
galaxy-in-a-box model accounts for a limited number of processes and
configurations, that is, it focuses on ongoing star formation in massive young
clusters in a spiral galaxy. Therefore, the inferred results, which
underestimate the emission and overestimate the SFR, are not surprising: known
sources of emission are not included in the model. To improve the results, the
next version of the model needs to include a more detailed treatment of the
entire galactic ecosystem and other processes that would contribute to the
emission.

biological phenomenon related to population spread and proliferation from

homogeneous diffusion and growth rates, however, this assumption can be
inaccurate when the population is intrinsically divided into many distinct
subpopulations that compete with each other. In previous work, the task of
inferring the degree of phenotypic heterogeneity between subpopulations from
total population density has been performed within a framework that combines
parameter distribution estimation with reaction-diffusion models. Here, we
extend this approach so that it is compatible with reaction-diffusion models
that include competition between subpopulations. We use a reaction-diffusion
model of Glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive type of brain cancer, to test
our approach on simulated data that are similar to measurements that could be
collected in practice. We use Prokhorov metric framework and convert the
reaction-diffusion model to a random differential equation model to estimate
joint distributions of diffusion and growth rates among heterogeneous
subpopulations. We then compare the new random differential equation model
performance against other partial differential equation models' performance. We
find that the random differential equation is more capable at predicting the
cell density compared to other models while being more time efficient. Finally,
we use $k$-means clustering to predict the number of subpopulations based on

the pulsar's astrometric, spin and orbital parameters by analyzing timing
measurements conducted at the Parkes, MeerKAT and Nan\c{c}ay radio telescopes
over almost two decades. The measurement of post-Keplerian perturbations to the
pulsar's orbit can be used to constrain the masses of the two component stars
of the binary, and in turn inform us on the history of the system. We analyzed
timing data from the Parkes, MeerKAT and Nan\c{c}ay radio telescopes collected
over $\sim$16 yrs, obtaining a precise rotation ephemeris for PSR J1528-3146. A
Bayesian analysis of the timing data was carried out to constrain the masses of
the two components and the orientation of the orbit. We further analyzed the
polarization properties of the pulsar, in order to constrain the orientations
of the magnetic axis and of the line-of-sight with respect to the spin axis. We
measured a significant rate of advance of periastron for the first time, and
put constraints on the Shapiro delay in the system and on the rate of change of
the projected semi-major axis of the pulsar's orbit. The Bayesian analysis
yielded measurements for the pulsar and companion masses of respectively $M_p =
1.61_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$ M$_\odot$ and $M_c = 1.33_{-0.07}^{+0.08}$ M$_\odot$
(68\% C.L.), confirming that the companion is indeed massive. This companion
mass as well as other characteristics of PSR J1528$-$3146 make this pulsar very
similar to PSR J2222-0137, a 32.8 ms pulsar orbiting a WD whose heavy mass
($\sim 1.32$ M$_\odot$) was unique among pulsar-WD systems until now. Our
measurements therefore suggest common evolutionary scenarios for PSRs

of 20 GW exceeding previous limits of solid-based acousto-optic modulation by
about three orders of magnitude, we reach a deflection efficiency greater than
50% while preserving excellent beam quality. Our approach is not limited to
laser pulse deflection via acousto-optic modulation: gas-phase photonic schemes
controlled by sonic waves can prospectively be translated to various optical
methods, e.g., lenses or waveguides, rendering them effectively invulnerable

issue by utilizing modern cryptosystems with homomorphic properties, which
allow a secure evaluation at the cost of an increased computation or
communication effort (among others). Recently, a cipher based on a random
affine transformation gained attention in the encrypted control community. Its
appeal stems from the possibility to construct security providing homomorphisms
that do not suffer from the restrictions of ``conventional'' approaches.
  This paper provides a cryptanalysis of random affine transformations in the
context of encrypted control. To this end, a deterministic and probabilistic
variant of the cipher over real numbers are analyzed in a generalized setup,
where we use cryptographic definitions for security and attacker models. It is
shown that the deterministic cipher breaks under a known-plaintext attack, and
unavoidably leaks information of the closed-loop, which opens another angle of
attack. For the probabilistic variant, statistical indistinguishability of
ciphertexts can be achieved, which makes successful attacks unlikely. We
complete our analysis by investigating a floating point realization of the
probabilistic random affine transformation cipher, which unfortunately suggests
the impracticality of the scheme if a security guarantee is needed.

propose a hybrid classical/quantum algorithm where the first step is performed
using a classical computer to obtain the tensor network ground state as well as
its quantum circuit representation, and the second step is executed on the
quantum computer to obtain the Green's function. Our algorithm exploits the
efficiency of tensor networks for preparing ground states on classical
computers, and takes advantage of quantum processors for the evaluation of the
time evolution, which can become intractable on classical computers. We
demonstrate the algorithm using 20 qubits on a quantum computing emulator for
SrVO3 with a multi-orbital Anderson impurity model within the dynamical mean
field theory. The tensor network based ground state quantum circuit preparation
algorithm can also be performed for up to 40 qubits with our available
computing resources, while the state vector emulation of the quantum algorithm
for time evolution is beyond what is accessible with such resources. We show
that, provided the tensor network calculation is able to accurately obtain the
ground state energy, this scheme does not require a perfect reproduction of the
ground state wave function on the quantum circuit to give an accurate Green's

trajectory may provide some insights into neurological diseases. In
neuroimaging, predicted brain age is widely used to analyze different diseases.
However, using only the brain age gap information (\ie the difference between
the chronological age and the estimated age) can be not enough informative for
disease classification problems. In this paper, we propose to extend the notion
of global brain age by estimating brain structure ages using structural
magnetic resonance imaging. To this end, an ensemble of deep learning models is
first used to estimate a 3D aging map (\ie voxel-wise age estimation). Then, a
3D segmentation mask is used to obtain the final brain structure ages. This
biomarker can be used in several situations. First, it enables to accurately
estimate the brain age for the purpose of anomaly detection at the population

reaction represents the interaction of different species. Generally, these
networks exhibit a multi-scale behavior caused by the high variability in
reaction rates and abundances of species. The so-called jump-diffusion
approximation is a valuable tool in the modeling of such systems. The
approximation is constructed by partitioning the reaction network into a fast
and slow subgroup of fast and slow reactions, respectively. This enables the
modeling of the dynamics using a Langevin equation for the fast group, while a
Markov jump process model is kept for the dynamics of the slow group. Most
often biochemical processes are poorly characterized in terms of parameters and
population states. As a result of this, methods for estimating hidden
quantities are of significant interest. In this paper, we develop a tractable
Bayesian inference algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo. The presented
blocked Gibbs particle smoothing algorithm utilizes a sequential Monte Carlo
method to estimate the latent states and performs distinct Gibbs steps for the
parameters of a biochemical reaction network, by exploiting a jump-diffusion
approximation model. The presented blocked Gibbs sampler is based on the two
distinct steps of state inference and parameter inference. We estimate states
via a continuous-time forward-filtering backward-smoothing procedure in the
state inference step. By utilizing bootstrap particle filtering within a
backward-smoothing procedure, we sample a smoothing trajectory. For estimating
the hidden parameters, we utilize a separate Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler
within the Gibbs sampler that uses the path-wise continuous-time representation
of the reaction counters. Finally, the algorithm is numerically evaluated for a

limitations is crucial for accurate modelling of interactions. We propose a new
computational framework addressing these limitations. Similar to game-theoretic
approaches, we model the interaction in an integral way rather than modelling
an isolated driver who only responds to their environment. Contrary to game
theory, our framework explicitly incorporates communication and bounded
rationality. We demonstrate the model in a simplified merging scenario,
illustrating that it generates plausible interactive behaviour (e.g.,
aggressive and conservative merging). Furthermore, human-like gap-keeping
behaviour emerged in a car-following scenario directly from risk perception
without the explicit implementation of time or distance gaps in the model's
decision-making. These results suggest that our framework is a promising
approach to interaction modelling that can support the development of

current induced by the time-dependent potential is opposed by a diffusive
current generated by the density inhomogeneity (a traveling wave) built up in

speed of the barrier and particle-number density. Indeed the presence of
nearest-neighbor interaction has a significant impact on the current: Repulsive
interaction enhances the current, whereas attractive interaction suppresses it
considerably. Quite remarkably, when the number density is low, the current
increases with the strength of the repulsive interaction and the maximum
current is obtained for the strongest possible repulsion strength, i.e., for
the nearest-neighbor exclusion. However, at high density, very strong repulsion
makes particle movement difficult in an overcrowded environment and, in that

(MOR) is a class of techniques that can deter model theft. A MOR scheme enables
an accuser to assert an ownership claim for a suspect model by presenting
evidence, such as a watermark or fingerprint, to show that the suspect model
was stolen or derived from a source model owned by the accuser. Most of the
existing MOR schemes prioritize robustness against malicious suspects, ensuring
that the accuser will win if the suspect model is indeed a stolen model.
  In this paper, we show that common MOR schemes in the literature are
vulnerable to a different, equally important but insufficiently explored,
robustness concern: a malicious accuser. We show how malicious accusers can
successfully make false claims against independent suspect models that were not
stolen. Our core idea is that a malicious accuser can deviate (without
detection) from the specified MOR process by finding (transferable) adversarial
examples that successfully serve as evidence against independent suspect

by probing responses of ferrimagnetic domain walls (DWs) to thermal gradients.
Similarly, voltages here stem from DW-spin collective motion, in contrast to
normal electron transport phenomena. We further develop finite-temperature
dynamics to investigate thermoelectric figures of merit and attribute
corresponding quantum superiority to ultrafast spin evolution of ferrimagnetism
with tunable non-Abelian phases. We propose a more likely cause of DW motion
towards hot or cold regions (contrary to conclusions of previous reports) and
verify existence of efficient magnon-momentum transfers. These findings deepen
our understanding of heat-driven DW kinetics and suggest profitable new
directions in an emerging realm of spincaloritronics.

($\rho_{150,\ {\rm DM}}$) and the pericentric distances ($r_{p}$) of the Milky
Way's (MW's) dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) has been reported in the
literature. The existence and origin of such anti-correlation is however
controversial, one possibility being that only the densest dSphs can survive
the tidal field towards the centre of our Galaxy. In this work, we place
particular emphasis on quantifying the statistical significance of such
anti-correlation, by using available literature data in order to explore its
robustness under different assumptions on the MW gravitational potential, and
for various derivations of $\rho_{150}$ and $r_{p}$. We consider models in
which the MW is isolated and has a low ($8.8\times10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$) and high
($1.6\times10^{12}\, M_{\odot}$) halo mass, respectively, as well as
configurations in which the MW's potential is perturbed by a Large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC) infall. We find that, while data generally support models in which
the dSphs' central DM density decreases as a function of their pericentric
radius, this anti-correlation is statistically significant at $3\sigma$ level
only in $\sim$12$\%$ of the combinations of $\rho_{150}$ and $r_{p}$ explored.
Moreover, including the impact of the LMC's infall onto the MW weakens or even
washes away this anti-correlation, with respect to models in which the MW is
isolated. Our results suggest that the strength and existence of such
anti-correlation is still debatable: exploring it with high-resolution
simulations including baryonic physics and different DM flavours will help us
to understand its emergence.

asymmetry in the framework of chiral magnetohydrodynamics with zero initial
total chirality. The initial magnetic field has a turbulent spectrum peaking at
a certain characteristic scale and is fully helical with positive helicity. The
initial chiral chemical potential is spatially uniform and negative. We
consider two opposite cases where the ratio of the length scale of the chiral
plasma instability (CPI) to the characteristic scale of the turbulence is
smaller and larger than unity. These initial conditions might be realized in
cosmological models such as certain types of axion inflation. The magnetic
field and chiral chemical potential evolve with inverse cascading in such a way
that the magnetic helicity and chirality cancel each other at all times. The
CPI time scale is found to determine mainly the time when the magnetic helicity
spectrum attains negative values at high wave numbers. The turnover time of the
energy-carrying eddies, on the other hand, determines the time when the peak of
the spectrum starts to shift to smaller wave numbers via an inverse cascade.
The onset of helicity decay is determined by the time when the chiral magnetic
effect becomes efficient at the peak of the initial magnetic energy spectrum.
When spin flipping is important, the chiral chemical potential vanishes and the
magnetic helicity becomes constant, which leads to a faster increase of the
correlation length, as expected from magnetic helicity conservation. This also
happens when the initial total chirality is imbalanced. Our findings have
important implications for baryogenesis after axion inflation.

counted every detected BMR as a new one and have not been able to study the
full life history of each BMRs. To address this issue, we have developed an
Automatic Tracking Algorithm (AutoTAB) for BMRs, that tracks the BMRs for their
entire lifetime or throughout their disk passage. AutoTAB uses the binary maps
of detected BMRs to automatically track the regions. This is done by
differentially rotating the binary maps of the detected regions and checking
for overlaps between them. In this first article of this project, we provide a
detailed description of the working of the algorithm and evaluate its strengths
and weaknesses. We also compare its performance with other existing tracking
techniques. AutoTAB excels in tracking even for the small features and it
successfully tracks 9152 BMRs over the last two solar cycles (1996-2020),
providing a comprehensive dataset that depicts the evolution of various
properties for each tracked region. The tracked BMRs follow familiar properties
of solar cycles except for these small BMRs that appear at all phases of the
solar cycle and show weak latitudinal dependency, which is represented through
the butterfly diagram. Finally, we discuss the possibility of adapting our
algorithm to other datasets and expanding the technique to track other solar
features in the future.

resistance of these materials is currently an important limitation however, due
to manufacturing defects such as semi-fused particles and weld lines. Here
Hirtisation$^\circledR$ is used for post-processing of Ti-6Al-4V lattices,
reducing the strut surface roughness (Sa) from 12 to 6 $\mu$m, removing all
visible semi-fused particles. The evenness of this treatment in lattices with
$\rho /\rho_{s}$ up to 18.3% and treatment depth of 6.5 mm was assessed,
finding no evidence of reduced effectiveness on internal surfaces. After
normalising to quasi-static mechanical properties to account for material
losses during hirtisation (34-37% reduction in strut diameter), the fatigue
properties show a marked improvement due to the reduction in surface roughness.
Normalised high cycle fatigue strength ($\sigma_{f,10^{6}}/\sigma_{y}$)
increased from around 0.1 to 0.16-0.21 after hirtisation, an average increase
of 80%. For orthopaedic implant devices where matching the stiffness of
surrounding bone is crucial, the $\sigma_{f}/E$ ratio is a key metric. After
hirtisation the $\sigma_{f}/E$ ratio increased by 90%, enabling design of
stiffness matched implant materials with greater fatigue strength. This work
demonstrates that hirtisation is an effective method for improving the surface
roughness of porous lattice materials, thereby enhancing their fatigue
performance.

Behavioural design in video games plays a significant role in enabling
time-based addiction. Games are designed to be engaging and enjoyable, with
features such as rewards, leveling up, and social competition, which is all
intended to keep players coming back for more. This article reviews the
behavioural design used in video games, and media more broadly, to increase the
addictive nature of these experiences. By doing so the article aims to
recognise time-based addiction as a problem that in large part stems from

Hereto, a mathematical description of the concept of balanced growth in terms
of cell mass distribution is presented. The cell mass distribution, quantified
by the Number Density Function (NDF), is affected by cell growth and cell
division. An optimization program is formulated in a general manner in which
the NDF, average cell culture growth rate and reaction rates per cell mass are
treated as optimization variables. As qualitative proof of concept, the
methodology is illustrated on a core carbon model of Escherichia coli under
aerobic growth conditions. This illustrates feasibility and applications of
this method, while indicating some shortcomings intrinsic to the simplified
biomass structuring and the time invariant approach.

repeated interactions with an environment as opposed to designing them by hand.
In recent years, this framework has established itself as a promising tool for
building models of human cognition. Yet, a coherent research program around
meta-learned models of cognition is still missing. The purpose of this article
is to synthesize previous work in this field and establish such a research
program. We rely on three key pillars to accomplish this goal. We first point
out that meta-learning can be used to construct Bayes-optimal learning
algorithms. This result not only implies that any behavioral phenomenon that
can be explained by a Bayesian model can also be explained by a meta-learned
model but also allows us to draw strong connections to the rational analysis of
cognition. We then discuss several advantages of the meta-learning framework
over traditional Bayesian methods. In particular, we argue that meta-learning
can be applied to situations where Bayesian inference is impossible and that it
enables us to make rational models of cognition more realistic, either by
incorporating limited computational resources or neuroscientific knowledge.
Finally, we reexamine prior studies from psychology and neuroscience that have
applied meta-learning and put them into the context of these new insights. In
summary, our work highlights that meta-learning considerably extends the scope
of rational analysis and thereby of cognitive theories more generally.

viruses belonging to the Coronaviridae family. Various animal species, mainly
mammalian and avian, are severely infected by various coronaviruses, causing
serious concerns like the recent pandemic (COVID-19). Therefore, building a
deeper understanding of these viruses is essential to devise prevention and
mitigation mechanisms. In the Coronavirus genome, an essential structural
region is the spike region, and it's responsible for attaching the virus to the
host cell membrane. Therefore, the usage of only the spike protein, instead of
the full genome, provides most of the essential information for performing
analyses such as host classification. In this paper, we propose a novel method
for predicting the host specificity of coronaviruses by analyzing spike protein
sequences from different viral subgenera and species. Our method involves using
the Poisson correction distance to generate a distance matrix, followed by
using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel and kernel principal component
analysis (PCA) to generate a low-dimensional embedding. Finally, we apply
classification algorithms to the low-dimensional embedding to generate the
resulting predictions of the host specificity of coronaviruses. We provide
theoretical proofs for the non-negativity, symmetry, and triangle inequality
properties of the Poisson correction distance metric, which are important
properties in a machine-learning setting. By encoding the spike protein
structure and sequences using this comprehensive approach, we aim to uncover
hidden patterns in the biological sequences to make accurate predictions about
host specificity. Finally, our classification results illustrate that our
method can achieve higher predictive accuracy and improve performance over

  figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Process matrices are a framework to model causal relations in the absence of
a well-defined acyclic causal order. The framework is very general and does not
even assume the existence of a background spacetime. As a result, it is an open
question how the framework should be interpreted physically and how and even if
composition can be defined. On the other hand, so-called causal boxes define a
framework that allows for arbitrary composition. In this work, we treat quantum
circuits with quantum control of causal order (QC-QC), a subset of process
matrices, which can be interpreted as generalized quantum circuits, and process
box, a subset of causal boxes, which can be interpreted as processes. We
analyze their state spaces and define a notion of operational equivalence
between QC-QCs and process boxes based on this analysis. We then explicitly
construct for each QC-QC an operationally equivalent process box. This allows
us to define composition of QC-QCs in terms of composition of causal boxes
which is well-defined. We further show that process boxes admit a unitary
extension and conjecture that the background spacetime can be assumed to have a
specific simple form. Based on this conjecture, we construct an operationally
equivalent QC-QC for each process box. Our results indicate that the only class
of processes that can be physically implemented in a fixed background spacetime
are those that can be interpreted as quantum circuits with quantum controlled
superpositions of orders. Further, they also reveal that the composability
issue can be resolved by embedding processes in a spacetime structure. This in
turn sheds light on the connection between physical realizability in a
spacetime and composability.

al., Gen. Relativ. Gravit., 33 (2001) 183). Similarly, quantum field theoretic
arguments yield a non-zero amplitude for a massive particle to cross the light
cone (that is, into the $\mathtt{CFR}$). The signs of these amplitudes are
opposite for fermions and antifermions. This has given rise to an erroneous
conclusion that amplitude to cross the lightcone is identically zero. This is
true as long as a measurement does not reveal the considered object to be a
particle or antiparticle. However, neutrino oscillation experiments do measure
a neutrino $\nu$, or an antineutrino $\bar\nu$. Here we show that in the

resolve various short baseline anomalies for a sufficiently light lowest mass

been proposed for RNRL, they capture the pairwise relationships/connections

high-order relationships (e.g., those roads that jointly form a local region

  Aware Multiple LSTM",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Public transportation has been essential in people's lives in recent years.
Bus ridership is a factor in people's choice to board the bus. Therefore, from
the perspective of improving service quality, it is important to inform
passengers who have not boarded the bus yet about future bus ridership.
However, there is a concern that providing inaccurate information may cause a
negative experience. Against this backdrop, there is a need to provide bus
passengers who have not boarded yet with highly accurate predictions. Many
researchers are working on studies on this. However, two issues summarize
related studies. The first is that the correlation of bus ridership between
consecutive bus stops should be considered for the prediction. The second is
that the prediction has yet to be made using all of the features shown to be
useful in each related study. This study proposes a prediction method that
addresses both of these issues. We solve the first issue by designing an
LSTM-based architecture for each bus stop and a single model for the entire bus
stop. We solve the second issue by inputting all useful data, the past bus
ridership, day of the week, time section, weather, and precipitation, as
features. Bus ridership at each bus stop collected from buses operated by
Minato Kanko Bus Inc, in Kobe city, Hyogo, Japan, from October 1, 2021, to

relationship between non-unitary conformal field theories and the
$k$-linear-type SEPs, which is typically associated with
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry or pesdo-Hermicity spontaneous breaking. The underlying
association between $k$-square-root-type SEPs, which arise concurrently with

first-order-phase-transition criticalities, and complex conformal field
theories (cCFTs) is addressed through the calculation of complex central

  & Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph.SR astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context. The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) observed around
450,000 eclipsing binaries (EBs) towards the Galactic Bulge. Decade-long
photometric observations such as these provide an exceptional opportunity to
thoroughly examine the targets. However, observing dense stellar fields such as
the Bulge may result in blends and contamination by close objects.
  Aims. We searched for periodic variations in the residual light curves of EBs
in OGLE-IV and created a new catalogue for the EBs that contain `background'
signals after the investigation of the source of the signal.
  Methods. From the about half a million EB systems, we selected those that
contain more than 4000 data points. We fitted the EB signal with a simple model
and subtracted it. To identify periodical signals in the residuals, we used a
GPU-based phase dispersion minimisation python algorithm called cuvarbase and
validated the found periods with Lomb-Scargle periodograms. We tested the
reliability of our method with artificial light curves.
  Results. We identified 354 systems where short-period background variation
was significant. In these cases, we determined whether it is a new variable or
just the result of contamination by an already catalogued nearby one. We
classified 292 newly found variables into EB, $\delta$ Scuti, or RR Lyrae
categories, or their sub-classes, and collected them in a catalogue. We also
discovered four new doubly eclipsing systems and one eclipsing multiple system
with a $\delta$ Scuti variable, and modelled the outer orbits of the
components.

  algorithm for the welded tree problem","comments are welcome",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  TThe welded tree problem is a black-box problem to find the exit of the
welded tree with $\Theta(2^n)$ vertices starting from the given entrance, for
which there are quantum algorithms with exponential speedups over the best
classical algorithm. The original quantum algorithm is based on continuous time
quantum walks (CTQW), and it has never been clear whether there are efficient
algorithms based on discrete time quantum walks (DTQW) until recently the
multidimensional quantum walk framework was proposed (Jeffery and Zur,
STOC'2023). In this paper, we propose a rather concise algorithm based purely
on the simplest coined quantum walks, which is simply to iterate the naturally
defined coined quantum walk operator for a predetermined time $T \in O(n \log
n)$ and then measure to obtain the exit name with $\Omega(\frac{1}{n})$
probability. The algorithm can be further promoted to be error-free and with
$O(n^{1.5} \log n)$ query complexity. The numerical simulation strongly implies
that the actual complexity of our algorithm is $O(n^{4/3})$.
  The significance of our results may be seen as follows. (i) Our algorithm is
rather concise compared with the one in (Jeffery and Zur, STOC'2023), which not
only changes the stereotype that the exiting DTQW frameworks before the
multidimensional one can achieve at most a quadratic speedup over the best
classical algorithm, but also re-displays the power of the simplest framework
of quantum walks. (ii) Our algorithm can be made error-free theoretically,
whereas all the existing methods cannot. Thus, it is one of the few examples of
an exponential separation between the error-free (exact) quantum and the
randomized query complexities, which perhaps also change people's idea that
quantum mechanics is inherently probabilistic and thus deterministic quantum
algorithms with exponential speedups for the problem are out of the question.

cause substantial damage to the cyber-infrastructure of our modern society and
economy. To minimize the consequences, it is vital to detect and fix
vulnerabilities as soon as possible. Just-in-time vulnerability detection
(JIT-VD) discovers vulnerability-prone (""dangerous"") commits to prevent them
from being merged into source code and causing vulnerabilities. By JIT-VD, the
commits' authors, who understand the commits properly, can review these
dangerous commits and fix them if necessary while the relevant modifications
are still fresh in their minds. In this paper, we propose CodeJIT, a novel
code-centric learning-based approach for just-in-time vulnerability detection.
The key idea of CodeJIT is that the meaning of the code changes of a commit is
the direct and deciding factor for determining if the commit is dangerous for
the code. Based on that idea, we design a novel graph-based representation to
represent the semantics of code changes in terms of both code structures and
program dependencies. A graph neural network model is developed to capture the
meaning of the code changes represented by our graph-based representation and
learn to discriminate between dangerous and safe commits. We conducted
experiments to evaluate the JIT-VD performance of CodeJIT on a dataset of 20K+
dangerous and safe commits in 506 real-world projects from 1998 to 2022. Our
results show that CodeJIT significantly improves the state-of-the-art JIT-VD
methods by up to 66% in Recall, 136% in Precision, and 68% in F1. Moreover,
CodeJIT correctly classifies nearly 9/10 of dangerous/safe (benign) commits and
even detects 69 commits that fix a vulnerability yet produce other issues in
source code

(such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and extinction) of young
low-mass stars by coupling the Phoenix stellar atmosphere model with a
conditional invertible neural network (cINN). Our networks allow us to infer
the posterior distribution of each stellar parameter from the optical spectrum.
  Methods. We discuss cINNs trained on three different Phoenix grids: Settl,
NextGen, and Dusty. We evaluate the performance of these cINNs on unlearned
Phoenix synthetic spectra and on the spectra of 36 Class III template stars
with well-characterised stellar parameters.
  Results. We confirm that the cINNs estimate the considered stellar parameters
almost perfectly when tested on unlearned Phoenix synthetic spectra. Applying
our networks to Class III stars, we find good agreement with deviations of at
most 5--10 per cent. The cINNs perform slightly better for earlier-type stars
than for later-type stars like late M-type stars, but we conclude that
estimations of effective temperature and surface gravity are reliable for all
spectral types within the network's training range.
  Conclusions. Our networks are time-efficient tools applicable to large
amounts of observations. Among the three networks, we recommend using the cINN
trained on the Settl library (Settl-Net), as it provides the best performance
across the largest range of temperature and gravity.

creation of a comprehensive dataset comprising multiple features extracted from
short videos; (2) development of a multimodal rumor detection model: first, we
employ the Temporal Segment Networks (TSN) video coding model to extract video
features, followed by the utilization of Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to extract textual features.
Subsequently, the BERT model is employed to fuse textual and video features;
(3) distinction is achieved through contrast learning: we acquire external

incorporate this knowledge into the classification output. Our research process
is driven by practical considerations, and the knowledge derived from this

the integrity of security-critical systems, such as self-driving cars. While
different defenses have been proposed to address this threat, they all rely on
the assumption that the hardware on which the learning models are executed
during inference is trusted. In this paper, we challenge this assumption and
introduce a backdoor attack that completely resides within a common hardware
accelerator for machine learning. Outside of the accelerator, neither the
learning model nor the software is manipulated, so that current defenses fail.
To make this attack practical, we overcome two challenges: First, as memory on
a hardware accelerator is severely limited, we introduce the concept of a
minimal backdoor that deviates as little as possible from the original model
and is activated by replacing a few model parameters only. Second, we develop a
configurable hardware trojan that can be provisioned with the backdoor and
performs a replacement only when the specific target model is processed. We
demonstrate the practical feasibility of our attack by implanting our hardware
trojan into the Xilinx Vitis AI DPU, a commercial machine-learning accelerator.
We configure the trojan with a minimal backdoor for a traffic-sign recognition
system. The backdoor replaces only 30 (0.069%) model parameters, yet it
reliably manipulates the recognition once the input contains a backdoor
trigger. Our attack expands the hardware circuit of the accelerator by 0.24%
and induces no run-time overhead, rendering a detection hardly possible. Given
the complex and highly distributed manufacturing process of current hardware,
our work points to a new threat in machine learning that is inaccessible to
current security mechanisms and calls for hardware to be manufactured only in
fully trusted environments.

entirely, endowing them with exceptional dexterity and reconfigurability. Key
to their unmatched ability to control nearly infinite degrees of freedom is the
architecture into which muscle fibers are weaved. Their arrangement is,
effectively, the instantiation of a sophisticated mechanical program that
mediates, and likely facilitates, the control and realization of complex,
dynamic morphological reconfigurations. Here, by combining medical imaging,
biomechanical data, live behavioral experiments and numerical simulations, we
synthesize a model octopus arm entailing ~200 continuous muscles groups, and
begin to unravel its complexity. We show how 3D arm motions can be understood
in terms of storage, transport, and conversion of topological quantities,
effected by simple muscle activation templates. These, in turn, can be composed
into higher-level control strategies that, compounded by the arm's compliance,
are demonstrated in a range of object manipulation tasks rendered additionally
challenging by the need to appropriately align suckers, to sense and grasp.
Overall, our work exposes broad design and algorithmic principles pertinent to
muscular hydrostats, robotics, and dynamics, while significantly advancing our
ability to model muscular structures from medical imaging, with potential
implications for human health and care.

The linear and nonlinear evolution of the TAEs are simulated by the FAR3d code

the overlapping of 1/2-1/1, 2/3-2/4 and 3/5-3/6 TAEs in the inner-middle plasma

3/4-3/5 TAEs are further destabilized due to the energy transfer from 1/1-1/2
TAE, leading to a broad TAEs radial overlapping and the MHD burst triggering.
The energy of 1/1-1/2 TAE is also nonlinearly transferred to the thermal plasma
destabilizing the 0/0 and 0/1 modes, inducing the generation of shear flows and
zonal currents as well as large deformations in the thermal pressure and EP
density radial profiles. The nonlinear simulation reproduces the same
succession of instabilities and the same frequency range with respect to the
experiment. The instability propagates outward during the bursting phase,
showing a large decrease of the EP density profile between the middle-outer
plasma, pointing out the loss of part of the EP population that explains the
decrease of the plasma heating efficiency observed during the MHD burst.

estimate the temporal evolution of the upper limits of the intrinsic luminosity

upper limits are higher for higher neutron star (NS) kick velocities due to the
increased absorption from the surrounding cold ejecta. We compare NS cooling
models with both the intrinsic luminosity limits obtained from the X-ray
spectra, and the ALMA constraints with the assumption that the observed blob of
SN 1987A is primarily heated by thermal emission. We find that the synthetic
Lynx spectra are crucial to constrain physical properties of the CCO, which
will be confirmed by future observations in the 2040s. We draw our conclusions
based on two scenarios, namely the non-detection and detection of NS by Lynx.
If the NS is not detected, its kick velocity should be ~700 km/s. Furthermore,
the non-detection of the NS would suggest rapid cooling processes around the
age of 40 years, implying strong crust superfluidity. Conversely, in the case
of NS detection, the mass of the NS envelope must be high.

independent of microscopic details and arises as long as the hole carriers have
nonzero Berry curvature density within a finite energy window, possibly due to

problems. Our two-chamber architecture relies on a robust and easy-to-implement
combination of gray molasses and optical transport from a laser-cooling chamber
to a glass cell with excellent optical access. There, we first create unitary
Fermi superfluids in a three-dimensional axially symmetric harmonic trap and
characterize them using in situ thermometry, reaching temperatures below 20 nK.
This allows us to enter the deep superfluid regime with samples of extreme
diluteness, where the interparticle spacing is sufficiently large for direct
single-atom imaging. Secondly, we generate optical lattice potentials with
triangular and honeycomb geometry in which we study diffraction of molecular
Bose-Einstein condensates, and show how going beyond the Kapitza-Dirac regime
allows us to unambiguously distinguish between the two geometries. With the
ability to probe quantum many-body physics in both discrete and continuous
space, and its suitability for bulk and single-atom imaging, our setup
represents an important step towards achieving a wide-scope quantum simulator.

surveying a set number of people to determine, which emotions were associated
with a specific interpretation and instruments. As a result of machine learning
this conductor was then able to achieve his goal. Unlike earlier studies of
virtual conductors, which would replace the role of a human conductor, this new
one is supposed to be an assisting tool for conductors. As a result, starting
on a new interpretation will be easier because it streamlines research time and

stellar halo, which we expect to contain a fossil record of M94's past mergers.
Using Subaru's Hyper Suprime-Cam, we resolve and identify red giant branch
(RGB) stars in M94's halo, finding two distinct populations. After correcting
for completeness through artificial star tests, we can measure the radial
profile of each RGB population. The metal-rich RGB stars show an unbroken
exponential profile to a radius of 30 kpc that is a clear continuation of M94's
outer disk. M94's metal poor stellar halo is detectable over a wider area and
clearly separates from its metal-rich disk. By integrating the halo density
profile, we infer a total accreted stellar mass of $\sim 2.8 \times 10^8
M_\odot$, with a median metallicity of [M/H] $=-$1.4. This indicates that M94's
most-massive past merger was with a galaxy similar to, or less massive than,
the Small Magellanic Cloud. Few nearby galaxies have had such a low-mass
dominant merger; therefore we suggest that M94's pseudobulge was not

intermediate to neovascular age-related macular degeneration (iAMD, nAMD) a
challenging task. We develop a Deep Learning (DL) model to predict the future
risk of conversion of an eye from iAMD to nAMD from its current OCT scan.
Although eye clinics generate vast amounts of longitudinal OCT scans to monitor
AMD progression, only a small subset can be manually labeled for supervised DL.
To address this issue, we propose Morph-SSL, a novel Self-supervised Learning
(SSL) method for longitudinal data. It uses pairs of unlabelled OCT scans from
different visits and involves morphing the scan from the previous visit to the
next. The Decoder predicts the transformation for morphing and ensures a smooth
feature manifold that can generate intermediate scans between visits through
linear interpolation. Next, the Morph-SSL trained features are input to a
Classifier which is trained in a supervised manner to model the cumulative
probability distribution of the time to conversion with a sigmoidal function.
Morph-SSL was trained on unlabelled scans of 399 eyes (3570 visits). The
Classifier was evaluated with a five-fold cross-validation on 2418 scans from
343 eyes with clinical labels of the conversion date. The Morph-SSL features
achieved an AUC of 0.766 in predicting the conversion to nAMD within the next 6
months, outperforming the same network when trained end-to-end from scratch or
pre-trained with popular SSL methods. Automated prediction of the future risk

regularity properties of financial returns, to analyze the long-term memory and

structural detrended multifractal fluctuation analysis (S-MF-DFA) to
investigate the efficiency of the main cryptocurrencies. The new methodology
generalizes the conventional approach by allowing it to proceed on the
different fluctuation regimes previously determined using a change-points
detection test. In this framework, the characterization of the various
exogenous factors influencing the scaling behavior is performed on the basis of
a single-factor model, thus creating a kind of self-explainable machine
learning for price forecasting. The proposal is tested on the daily data of the
three among the main cryptocurrencies in order to examine whether the digital
market has experienced upheavals in recent years and whether this has in some
ways led to a structured multifractal behavior. The sampled period ranges from
April 2017 to December 2022. We especially detect common periods of local
scaling for the three prices with a decreasing multifractality after 2018.
Complementary tests on shuffled and surrogate data prove that the distribution,
linear correlation, and nonlinear structure also explain at some level the
structural multifractality. Finally, prediction experiments based on neural
networks fed with multi-fractionally differentiated data show the interest of
this new self-explained algorithm, thus giving decision-makers and investors
the ability to use it for more accurate and interpretable forecasts.

Although recent studies have achieved promising results in automatic impression

pre-trained language models, such models often require substantial amounts of

hidden sectors may couple feebly with the visible sectors via a variety of
portals. While the coupling of the hidden sector to the visible sector is
feeble its coupling to the inflaton is largely unknown. It could couple feebly
or with the same strength as the visible sector which would result in either a
cold or a hot hidden sector at the end of reheating. These two possibilities
could lead to significantly different outcomes for observables. We investigate
the thermal evolution of the two sectors in a cosmologically consistent hidden
sector dark matter model where the hidden sector and the visible sector are
thermally coupled and their thermal evolution occurs without the assumption of
separate entropy conservation for each sector. Within this framework we analyze
several phenomena to illustrate their dependence on the initial conditions.
These include the allowed parameter space of models, dark matter relic density,
proton-dark matter cross section, effective massless neutrino species at BBN
time, self-interacting dark matter cross-section, where self-interaction occurs
via exchange of dark photon, and Sommerfeld enhancement. Finally fits to the
velocity dependence of dark matter cross sections from galaxy scales to the
scale of galaxy clusters is given. The analysis indicates significant effects
of the initial conditions on the observables listed above. The analysis is
carried out within the framework where dark matter is constituted of dark
fermions and the mediation between the visible and the hidden sector occurs via
the exchange of dark photons. The techniques discussed here may have
applications for a wider class of hidden sector models using different
mediations between the visible and the hidden sectors to explore the impact of
Big Bang initial conditions on observable physics.

local contents and textures from source images for consistency. To further
alleviate the query confusion between foreground and background, we propose a

Z^3$. To formulate these results, recall that a perfect matching on a bipartite
graph induces a flow that sends one unit of current from each even vertex to
its odd partner. One can then subtract a ""reference flow'' to obtain a
divergence-free flow.
  We show that the flow induced by a uniformly random dimer configuration
converges in law (when boundary conditions on a bounded $R \subset \mathbb R^3$
are controlled and the mesh size tends to zero) to the deterministic
divergence-free flow $g$ on $R$ that maximizes
  $$\int_{R} \text{ent}(g(x)) \,dx$$ given the boundary data, where
$\text{ent}(s)$ is the maximal specific entropy obtained by an ergodic Gibbs
measure with mean current $s$. The function $\text{ent}$ is not known
explicitly, but we prove that it is continuous and {\em strictly concave} on
the octahedron $\mathcal O$ of possible mean currents (except on the edges of
$\mathcal O$) which implies (under reasonable boundary conditions) that the
maximizer is uniquely determined. We further establish two versions of a large
deviation principle, using the integral above to quantify how exponentially
unlikely the discrete random flows are to approximate other deterministic
flows.

analysis begins with a smaller set of tools, which include Hall's matching

sensor, we obtain a Landau fan diagram which shows linear shifts in carrier

FQAH states with fractionally quantized Hall conductance of -2/3$e^2/h$ and

the spatial U-Net as is for video generation. We achieve this by shifting two
portions of the feature map channels forward and backward along the temporal
dimension. The shifted features of the current frame thus receive the features
from the previous and the subsequent frames, enabling motion learning without
additional parameters. We show that Latent-Shift achieves comparable or better
results while being significantly more efficient. Moreover, Latent-Shift can
generate images despite being finetuned for T2V generation.

knowledge of stellar activity into practical data analysis methods. In
particular, we aim at obtaining kernels with physical parameters. This has two
purposes: better modelling signals of stellar origin to find smaller
exoplanets, and extracting information about the star from the statistical
properties of the data. We consider several observational channels such as
photometry, radial velocity, activity indicators, and build a model called
FENRIR to represent their stochastic variations due to stellar surface
inhomogeneities. We compute analytically the covariance of this multi-channel
stochastic process, and implement it in the S+LEAF framework to reduce the cost
of likelihood evaluations from $O(N^3)$ to $O(N)$. We also compute analytically
higher order cumulants of our FENRIR model, which quantify its non-Gaussianity.
We obtain a fast Gaussian process framework with physical parameters, which we
apply to the HARPS-N and SORCE observations of the Sun, and constrain a solar
inclination compatible with the viewing geometry. We then discuss the
application of our formalism to granulation. We exhibit non-Gaussianity in
solar HARPS radial velocities, and argue that information is lost when stellar
activity signals are assumed to be Gaussian. We finally discuss the origin of
phase shifts between RVs and indicators, and how to build relevant activity
indicators. We provide an open-source implementation of the FENRIR Gaussian

the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole which are characterized by a single
metric function or forming a perturbative spanning set of the space of
effective theories of gravity. In this work, we classify all inequivalent GQTGs
at all curvature orders $n$ and spacetime dimension $D \geq 4$. This is
achieved after the explicit construction of a dictionary that allows the uplift
of expressions evaluated on a single-function static and spherically symmetric
ansatz into fully covariant ones. On the one hand, applying such prescription
for $D \geq 5$, we find the explicit covariant form of the unique inequivalent
Quasitopological Gravity that exists at each $n$ and, for the first time, the
covariant expressions of the $n-2$ inequivalent proper GQTGs existing at every

with a metal poor nature (2$-$30% $Z_{\odot}$) and intense ionizing radiation
fields. The galaxies with the highest equivalent widths of Lyman-$\alpha$, in

bridge the gap between what one learns in typical introductory quantum field
theory classes and what one needs to understand to follow modern developments
in particle theory beyond the Standard Model. Topics covered include global and
gauge symmetries, charge quantization, instantons, chiral anomalies, the Strong
CP problem, axion models from 4d and from higher dimensions, the expected
absence of global symmetries in quantum gravity, and some phenomenological
implications thereof. If these topics seem to be at best loosely related, I
hope that reading the notes will convince you otherwise. Recent developments in
quantum field theory have shown that ordinary gauge theories exhibit a much
wider range of (generalized) global symmetries than were previously understood,
while recent work in quantum gravity has provided sharper arguments that global
symmetries should not exist. This sets up an interesting tension, the
resolution of which can have implications for particle physics in the real
world. Axion physics is one setting in which these ideas can guide
phenomenology. The TASI audience comprised particle phenomenology students whom

evidence for a spectral-state dependent outflow, with mildly relativistic
speeds. In particular, the soft and intermediate states point to a hot plasma
outflowing at 0.05-0.15 $c$. This speeds rule-out thermal winds and, hence,
they suggest that such outflows could be radiation pressure or (most likely)

For open quantum systems, engineering many-body scarred dynamics by a

paper, we provide a general framework to exactly embed quantum many-body scars
into the decoherence-free subspaces of Lindblad master equations, and exhibit
their corresponding persistent periodic oscillations for generic initial

annihilate the whole scar towers, and utilize the Hamiltonian part to rotate
the undesired states out of the null space of dissipators. We demonstrate our

with more massive galaxies at similar redshifts from other programmes, we study
the scaling relations between stellar mass (M*), oxygen abundance (O/H), and
star-formation rate (SFR) across three orders of magnitude in mass out to the
epoch of early galaxy assembly. We find evidence for a shallower slope at the
low-mass-end of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR), with 12 + log(O/H) = (7.88
+- 0.03) + (0.17 +- 0.04) log(M*/10^8 M_sun), in good agreement with the MZR
probed by local analogues of high-redshift systems like `green pea' and
`blueberry' galaxies. The inferred slope is well matched by models including
`momentum-driven' SNe winds, suggesting that feedback mechanisms in dwarf
galaxies (and at high-z) might be different from those in place at higher
masses. The evolution in the normalisation is instead observed to be relatively
mild compared to previous determinations of the MZR at z~3 (~0.1-0.2 dex on
average). We also find a progressive deviation from the local fundamental
metallicity relation (FMR) as a function of redshift, especially at z>6, with
galaxies significantly less enriched (by ~0.4 dex on average) than predicted
given their M* and SFR. These observations are consistent with an enhanced
stochasticity in the accretion rate from the cosmic web, and/or with an
increased efficiency in metal removals by outflows, prompting us to reconsider
the nature of the relationship between M*, O/H, and SFR in the early Universe.

optical/near-infrared surveys, but brighter at longer wavelengths has been
uncovered in the past years. However, the nature of these optically dark/faint
galaxies (OFGs, among other nomenclatures) is highly uncertain. In this work,
we investigate the drivers of dust attenuation in the JWST era. Particularly,
we study the role of stellar mass, size, and orientation in obscuring
star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at $3 < z < 7.5$, focusing on understanding why
galaxies like OFGs are so faint at optical/near-infrared wavelengths. We find
that stellar mass is the primary proxy of dust attenuation among those studied.
Effective radius and axis ratio do not show a clear link with dust attenuation,
with the effect of orientation close to random. However, there is a subset of
highly dust attenuated ($A_V > 1$, typically) SFGs, of which OFGs are a
specific case. For this subset, we find that the key distinctive feature is
their compact size (for massive systems with $\log (M_{*}/M_{\odot}) > 10$),
exhibiting 30% smaller effective radius than the average SFGs at the same
stellar mass and redshift. On the contrary, they do not exhibit a preference
for low axis ratios (i.e., edge-on disks). The results in this work show
stellar mass as a primary proxy of dust attenuation and compact stellar light
profiles behind thick dust columns obscuring typical massive SFGs.

star-forming galaxies at $1.3\leq z\leq2.6$ from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution
Field (MOSDEF) survey. We divide galaxies with a detected H$\alpha$ emission
line and coverage of H$\beta$ into eight groups by stellar mass, star formation
rate (SFR), and inclination (i.e., axis ratio), then stack their spectra. From
each stack, we measure Balmer decrement and gas-phase metallicity, then we
compute median \AV and UV continuum spectral slope ($\beta$). First, we find
that none of the dust properties (Balmer decrement, \AV, $\beta$) vary with
axis ratio. Second, both stellar and nebular attenuation increase with
increasing galaxy mass, showing little residual dependence on SFR or
metallicity. Third, nebular emission is more attenuated than stellar emission,
and this difference grows even larger at higher galaxy masses and SFRs. Based
on these results, we propose a three-component dust model where attenuation
predominantly occurs in star-forming regions and large, dusty star-forming
clumps, with minimal attenuation in the diffuse ISM. In this model, nebular
attenuation primarily originates in clumps, while stellar attenuation is
dominated by star-forming regions. Clumps become larger and more common with
increasing galaxy mass, creating the above mass trends. Finally, we argue that
a fixed metal yield naturally leads to mass regulating dust attenuation. Infall
of low-metallicity gas increases SFR and lowers metallicity, but leaves dust
column density mostly unchanged. We quantify this idea using the
Kennicutt-Schmidt and fundamental metallicity relations, showing that galaxy
mass is indeed the primary driver of dust attenuation.

age in the range $3.5-10$~Myr representing the times when supernova first
explode to when LyC production significantly drops, and \textit{iii)} include a
proxy for neutral gas content and gas density in the interstellar medium. ${\rm

select for one or fewer of our criteria, rendering them either necessary but
insufficient or generally poor diagnostics. In contrast, UV slope ($\beta$),

query engine can flexibly combine advantages of all the existing strategies and

experiments demonstrate that hybrid materialization is almost two times faster

to human users. The way these interfaces select signals is typically
pre-defined by the designer: for instance, a haptic wristband might vibrate
when the robot is moving and squeeze when the robot stops. But different people
interpret the same signals in different ways, so that what makes sense to one
person might be confusing or unintuitive to another. In this paper we introduce
a unified algorithmic formalism for learning co-adaptive interfaces from
scratch. Our method does not need to know the human's task (i.e., what the
human is using these signals for). Instead, our insight is that interpretable
interfaces should select signals that maximize correlation between the human's
actions and the information the interface is trying to convey. Applying this
insight we develop LIMIT: Learning Interfaces to Maximize Information Transfer.
LIMIT optimizes a tractable, real-time proxy of information gain in continuous
spaces. The first time a person works with our system the signals may appear
random; but over repeated interactions the interface learns a one-to-one
mapping between displayed signals and human responses. Our resulting approach
is both personalized to the current user and not tied to any specific interface
modality. We compare LIMIT to state-of-the-art baselines across controlled
simulations, an online survey, and an in-person user study with auditory,
visual, and haptic interfaces. Overall, our results suggest that LIMIT learns

yield normalized x-space wave packets which reproduce the standard k-space
expectation values for energy and momentum from local momentum
pseudo-densities. However, in the case of bosonic fields, the wave packets are
nonlocally related to the corresponding relativistic quantum fields, and
therefore the canonical local energy-momentum densities differ from the
pseudo-densities and appear nonlocal in terms of the wave packets. We examine
the relation between the canonical energy density, the canonical charge
density, the energy pseudo-density, and the Born density for the massless free
Klein-Gordon field. We find that those four proxies for particle location are
tantalizingly close even in this extremely relativistic case: In spite of their
nonlocal mathematical relations, they are mutually local in the sense that
their maxima do not deviate beyond a common position uncertainty $\Delta x$.
Indeed, they are practically indistinguishable in cases where we would expect a
normalized quantum state to produce particle-like position signals, viz. if we
are observing quanta with momenta $p\gg\Delta p\ge\hbar/2\Delta x$. We also
translate our results to massless Dirac fields. Our results confirm and

its decay rate. In the SM, the latter is dominated by physics at the RG scale
at which $\lambda$ reaches its minimum, $\mu_*^{\text{SM}} \sim 10^{17}$ GeV.
RHNs generically push $\mu_*$ beyond the Planck scale, implying that
gravitational effects need to be taken into account. In this work, we perform
the first comprehensive study of electroweak vacuum metastability in the type-I
seesaw mechanism including these effects. Our analysis covers both low- and
high-scale seesaw models, with two as well as three RHNs and for multiple
values of the Higgs' non-minimal coupling to gravity. We find that
gravitational effects can significantly stabilize the vacuum, leading to weaker
metastability bounds. We show that metastability sets the strongest bounds for
low-scale seesaws with $M_N>1$ TeV. For high-scale seesaws, we find upper
bounds on the allowed masses for the RHNs, which are relevant for high-scale
leptogenesis. We also point out that $\text{Tr}(Y_\nu^\dagger Y_\nu)$, which is
commonly used to express these metastability bounds, cannot be used for all of
parameter space. Instead, we argue that bounds can always be expressed reliably
through $\text{Tr}(Y_\nu^\dagger Y_\nu\,Y_\nu^\dagger Y_\nu)$. Lastly, we use
this insight to develop a new technique for an easier RG analysis applicable to
scenarios with degenerate RHN masses.

particles interacting via local interactions of different character,
highlighting the fact that a faithful microscopic description of such systems

preparation, we examine four different versions of modern microscopic many-body
theory and conclude by emphasizing that these approaches, although {\it a

application. The only quantity that depends on the formulation of many-body
theory chosen is an {\it irreducible} interaction correction. In the language
of Green's functions and Feynman diagrams, it is the set of both
particle-particle and particle-hole irreducible diagrams, and in variational
Jastrow-Feenberg theory it is determined by {\it multipartite correlations} and
{\it elementary diagrams}. We apply these theoretical methods to the
calculation of the energetics, structure, thermodynamics, and dynamics of
$\alpha$ matter, as well as its condensate fraction. In dimensionless units,
$\alpha$ matter appears to be remarkably similar to the much-studied $^4$He
quantum fluid, its low-temperature properties now basically solved in the
Jastrow-Feenberg framework. Accordingly, one can have confidence in the results
of application of the same procedure to $\alpha$ matter. Even so, closer
examination reveals significant differences between the physics of the two
systems. Within an infinite nuclear medium, alpha matter is subject to a
spinoidal instability. Extended mixtures of nucleons and alpha particles are

farther from their progenitors than previously studied TDGs, suggesting they
are older and more evolved. AGC 219369 is likely dark matter dominated, while
AGC 123216 has a dark matter content that is unusually high for a TDG, but low
for a normal dwarf galaxy. We consider possible mechanisms for the formation of
the TDG candidates such as a traditional major merger scenario and gas ejection
from a high velocity fly-by. Blind HI surveys like ALFALFA enable the detection
of gas-rich, optically faint TDGs that can be overlooked in other surveys,
thereby providing a more complete census of the low-mass galaxy population and
an opportunity to study TDGs at a more advanced stage of their life cycle.

where the task is to classify a group of nodes (i.e., a subgraph) within a

function of a group of proteins or identifying rare diseases given a collection
of phenotypes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the de facto solution for node,
link, and graph-level tasks but fail to perform well on subgraph classification
tasks. Even GNNs tailored for graph classification are not directly
transferable to subgraph classification as they ignore the external topology of
the subgraph, thus failing to capture how the subgraph is located within the
larger graph. The current state-of-the-art models for subgraph classification
address this shortcoming through either labeling tricks or multiple
message-passing channels, both of which impose a computation burden and are not
scalable to large graphs. To address the scalability issue while maintaining
generalization, we propose Stochastic Subgraph Neighborhood Pooling (SSNP),
which jointly aggregates the subgraph and its neighborhood (i.e., external
topology) information without any computationally expensive operations such as
labeling tricks. To improve scalability and generalization further, we also
propose a simple data augmentation pre-processing step for SSNP that creates
multiple sparse views of the subgraph neighborhood. We show that our model is

demonstrate that our models outperform current state-of-the-art methods (with a

warm and dense environment, with dust temperatures ranging from 70 K to $\sim

collisional excitation in the dense core of the star-forming region. This
scenario is also supported by the detection of the medium-level excitation of
CO resulting in the line emission CO (J=8-7). Thanks to the unprecedented high
resolution offered by the combination of ALMA capabilities and gravitational

that while degree distribution tail exponents depend on the attribute type
(already derived by Jordan (2013)), Page-rank centrality scores have the
\emph{same} tail exponent across attributes. Moreover, the mean behavior of the
limiting Page-rank score distribution can be explicitly described and shown to
depend on the attribute type. The limit results also give explicit formulae for
the performance of various network sampling mechanisms. One surprising
consequence is the efficacy of Page-rank and walk based network sampling
schemes for directed networks in the setting of rare minorities. The results
also allow one to evaluate the impact of various proposed mechanisms to
increase degree centrality of minority attributes in the network, and to
quantify the bias in inferring about the network from an observed sample.
Further, we formalize the notion of resolvability of such models where, owing
to propagation of chaos type phenomenon in the evolution dynamics for such

model and draw inferences from large scale graph-structured data in various
application settings such as social networking. The primary goal of a GNN is to
learn an embedding for each graph node in a dataset that encodes both the node
features and the local graph structure around the node. Embeddings generated by
a GNN for a graph node are unique to that GNN. Prior work has shown that GNNs
are prone to model extraction attacks. Model extraction attacks and defenses
have been explored extensively in other non-graph settings. While detecting or
preventing model extraction appears to be difficult, deterring them via
effective ownership verification techniques offer a potential defense. In
non-graph settings, fingerprinting models, or the data used to build them, have
shown to be a promising approach toward ownership verification. We present
GrOVe, a state-of-the-art GNN model fingerprinting scheme that, given a target
model and a suspect model, can reliably determine if the suspect model was
trained independently of the target model or if it is a surrogate of the target
model obtained via model extraction. We show that GrOVe can distinguish between
surrogate and independent models even when the independent model uses the same
training dataset and architecture as the original target model. Using six
benchmark datasets and three model architectures, we show that consistently
achieves low false-positive and false-negative rates. We demonstrate that is

optimization for efficiently generating a large variety of combinatorial
objects based on graphs, matroids, posets and polytopes. Our method relies on a
simple and versatile algorithm for computing a Hamilton path on the skeleton of
any 0/1-polytope ${\rm conv}(X)$, where $X\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$. The algorithm
uses as a black box any algorithm that solves a variant of the classical linear
optimization problem $\min\{w\cdot x\mid x\in X\}$, and the resulting delay,
i.e., the running time per visited vertex on the Hamilton path, is only by a
factor of $\log n$ larger than the running time of the optimization algorithm.
When $X$ encodes a particular class of combinatorial objects, then traversing
the skeleton of the polytope ${\rm conv}(X)$ along a Hamilton path corresponds
to listing the combinatorial objects by local change operations, i.e., we
obtain Gray code listings. As concrete results of our general framework, we
obtain efficient algorithms for generating all ($c$-optimal) bases in a
matroid; ($c$-optimal) spanning trees, forests, ($c$-optimal) matchings in a
general graph; ($c$-optimal) vertex covers, ($c$-optimal) stable sets in a
bipartite graph; as well as ($c$-optimal) antichains and ideals of a poset. The
delay and space required by these algorithms are polynomial in the size of the
matroid, graph, or poset, respectively, and these listings correspond to
Hamilton paths on the corresponding combinatorial polytopes. We also obtain an
$O(t_{\rm LP} \log n)$ delay algorithm for the vertex enumeration problem on
0/1-polytopes $\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n\mid Ax\leq b\}$, where $A\in
\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ and $b\in\mathbb{R}^m$, and $t_{\rm LP}$ is the time

improves upon the 25-year old $O(t_{\rm LP}\,n)$ delay algorithm of Bussieck

for robotic systems remains a challenging task. Recently, collision detection
using differentiable optimization has provided a way to compute the minimum
uniform scaling factor that results in an intersection between two convex
shapes and to also compute the Jacobian of the scaling factor. In this paper,
we propose a framework that uses this scaling factor, with an offset, to
systematically define a CBF for obstacle avoidance tasks. We provide a
theoretical analysis that proves the continuity of the proposed CBF.
Empirically, we show that the proposed CBF is continuously differentiable, and
the resulting optimal control problem is computationally efficient, which makes
it applicable for real-time robotic control. We validate our approach, first
using a 2D mobile robot example, then on the Franka-Emika Research~3 (FR3)
robot manipulator both in simulation and experiment.

  and Information Design","8 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Misinformation has become a growing issue on online social platforms (OSPs),
especially during elections or pandemics. To combat this, OSPs have implemented
various policies, such as tagging, to notify users about potentially misleading
information. However, these policies are often transparent and therefore
susceptible to being exploited by content creators, who may not be willing to
invest effort into producing authentic content, causing the viral spread of
misinformation. Instead of mitigating the reach of existing misinformation,
this work focuses on a solution of prevention, aiming to stop the spread of
misinformation before it has a chance to gain momentum. We propose a Bayesian
persuaded branching process ($\operatorname{BP}^2$) to model the strategic
interactions among the OSP, the content creator, and the user. The
misinformation spread on OSP is modeled by a multi-type branching process,
where users' positive and negative comments influence the misinformation
spreading. Using a Lagrangian induced by Bayesian plausibility, we characterize
the OSP's optimal policy under the perfect Bayesian equilibrium. The convexity
of the Lagrangian implies that the OSP's optimal policy is simply the fully
informative tagging policy: revealing the content's accuracy to the user. Such
a tagging policy solicits the best effort from the content creator in reducing
misinformation, even though the OSP exerts no direct control over the content
creator. We corroborate our findings using numerical simulations.

intrinsic and extrinsic effects. When forecasting blood glucose, for example,
intrinsic effects can be inferred from the history of the target signal alone
(\textit{i.e.} blood glucose), but accurately modeling the impact of extrinsic
effects requires auxiliary signals, like the amount of carbohydrates ingested.
Standard forecasting techniques often assume that extrinsic and intrinsic
effects vary at similar rates. However, when auxiliary signals are generated at
a much lower frequency than the target variable (e.g., blood glucose
measurements are made every 5 minutes, while meals occur once every few hours),
even well-known extrinsic effects (e.g., carbohydrates increase blood glucose)
may prove difficult to learn. To better utilize these \textit{sparse but
informative variables} (SIVs), we introduce a novel encoder/decoder forecasting
approach that accurately learns the per-timepoint effect of the SIV, by (i)
isolating it from intrinsic effects and (ii) restricting its learned effect
based on domain knowledge. On a simulated dataset pertaining to the task of
blood glucose forecasting, when the SIV is accurately recorded our approach
outperforms baseline approaches in terms of rMSE (13.07 [95% CI: 11.77,14.16]
vs. 14.14 [12.69,15.27]). In the presence of a corrupted SIV, the proposed
approach can still result in lower error compared to the baseline but the
advantage is reduced as noise increases. By isolating their effects and
incorporating domain knowledge, our approach makes it possible to better
utilize SIVs in forecasting.

  Learning","This paper will appear in the proceedings of CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern Augmented reality applications require performing multiple tasks on
each input frame simultaneously. Multi-task learning (MTL) represents an
effective approach where multiple tasks share an encoder to extract
representative features from the input frame, followed by task-specific
decoders to generate predictions for each task. Generally, the shared encoder
in MTL models needs to have a large representational capacity in order to
generalize well to various tasks and input data, which has a negative effect on
the inference latency. In this paper, we argue that due to the large variations
in the complexity of the input frames, some computations might be unnecessary
for the output. Therefore, we introduce AdaMTL, an adaptive framework that
learns task-aware inference policies for the MTL models in an input-dependent
manner. Specifically, we attach a task-aware lightweight policy network to the
shared encoder and co-train it alongside the MTL model to recognize unnecessary
computations. During runtime, our task-aware policy network decides which parts
of the model to activate depending on the input frame and the target
computational complexity. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL dataset
demonstrate that AdaMTL reduces the computational complexity by 43% while
improving the accuracy by 1.32% compared to single-task models. Combined with
SOTA MTL methodologies, AdaMTL boosts the accuracy by 7.8% while improving the
efficiency by 3.1X. When deployed on Vuzix M4000 smart glasses, AdaMTL reduces
the inference latency and the energy consumption by up to 21.8% and 37.5%,

  Deterministic Ordering",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sharding scales throughput by splitting blockchain nodes into parallel
groups. However, different shards' independent and random scheduling for
cross-shard transactions results in numerous conflicts and aborts, since
cross-shard transactions from different shards may access the same account. A
deterministic ordering can eliminate conflicts by determining a global order
for transactions before processing, as proved in the database field.
Unfortunately, due to the intertwining of the Byzantine environment and
information isolation among shards, there is no trusted party able to
predetermine such an order for cross-shard transactions. To tackle this
challenge, this paper proposes Prophet, a conflict-free sharding blockchain
based on Byzantine-tolerant deterministic ordering. It first depends on
untrusted self-organizing coalitions of nodes from different shards to
pre-execute cross-shard transactions for prerequisite information about
ordering. It then determines a trusted global order based on stateless ordering
and post-verification for pre-executed results, through shard cooperation.
Following the order, the shards thus orderly execute and commit transactions
without conflicts. Prophet orchestrates the pre-execution, ordering, and
execution processes in the sharding consensus for minimal overhead. We
rigorously prove the determinism and serializability of transactions under the
Byzantine and sharded environment. An evaluation of our prototype shows that
Prophet improves the throughput by $3.11\times$ and achieves nearly no aborts
on 1 million Ethereum transactions compared with state-of-the-art sharding.

training datasets, effectively modeling the behavior of various road users in
an environment remains a significant research challenge. This reality
necessitates models that generalize to a broad range of domains and explicitly
model interactions between road users and the environment to improve scenario
understanding. Graph learning methods address this problem by modeling
interactions using graph representations of scenarios. However, existing
methods cannot effectively transfer knowledge gained from the training domain
to real-world scenarios. This constraint is caused by the domain-specific rules
used for graph extraction that can vary in effectiveness across domains,
limiting generalization ability. To address these limitations, we propose
RoadScene2Graph (RS2G): a data-driven graph extraction and modeling approach
that learns to extract the best graph representation of a road scene for
solving autonomous scene understanding tasks. We show that RS2G enables better
performance at subjective risk assessment than rule-based graph extraction
methods and deep-learning-based models. RS2G also improves generalization and
Sim2Real transfer learning, which denotes the ability to transfer knowledge

the Upgrade II phase, planed for the next decade. The limits in the storage
capacity of the trigger will bring an inverse relation between the amount of
particles selected to be stored per event and the number of events that can be
recorded, and the background levels will raise due to the enlarged
combinatorics. To tackle both challenges, we propose a novel approach, never
attempted before in a hadronic collider: a Deep-learning based Full Event
Interpretation (DFEI), to perform the simultaneous identification, isolation
and hierarchical reconstruction of all the heavy-hadron decay chains per event.
This approach radically contrasts with the standard selection procedure used in
LHCb to identify heavy-hadron decays, that looks individually at sub-sets of
particles compatible with being products of specific decay types, disregarding
the contextual information from the rest of the event. We present the first
prototype for the DFEI algorithm, that leverages the power of Graph Neural
Networks (GNN). This paper describes the design and development of the
algorithm, and its performance in Upgrade I simulated conditions.

stellar disk, using dust geometry. In a moderately-inclined disk galaxy, the
fraction of reddened stars is expected to be 50% everywhere, assuming that dust
lies in a thin midplane. In a thickened disk, however, a wide range of radii
project onto the line of sight. Assuming stellar density declines with radius,
this geometrical projection leads to differences in the numbers of stars on the
near and far sides of the thin dust layer. The fraction of reddened stars will
thus differ from the 50% prediction, with a deviation that becomes larger for
puffier disks. We map the fraction of reddened red giant branch (RGB) stars
across M31, which shows prominent dust lanes on only one side of the major
axis. The fraction of reddened stars varies systematically from 20% to 80%,
which requires that these stars have an exponential scale height h_z that is
0.14+/-0.015 times the exponential scale length (h_r~5.5kpc). M31's RGB stars
must therefore have h_z=770+/-80pc, which is far thicker than the Milky Way's
thin disk, but comparable to its thick disk. The lack of a significant thin
disk in M31 is unexpected, but consistent with its interaction history and high
disk velocity dispersion. We suggest that asymmetric reddening be used as a
generic criteria for identifying ``thick disk'' dominated systems, and discuss
prospects for future 3-dimensional tomographic mapping of the gas and stars in
M31.

for the clique number of the Paley graphs. The size of the maximal clique
(clique number) of a graph is a classic NP-complete problem; a Paley graph is a
deterministic graph where two vertices are connected if their difference is a
quadratic residue modulo certain prime powers. Improving the upper bound for
the Paley graph clique number for odd prime powers is an open problem in
combinatorics. Moreover, since quadratic residues exhibit pseudorandom
properties, Paley graphs are related to the construction of deterministic
restricted isometries, an open problem in compressed sensing and sparse
recovery. Recent work provides evidence that the current upper bounds can be
improved by the sum-of-squares (SOS) relaxations. In particular the bounds
given by the SOS relaxations of degree 4 (SOS-4) are asymptotically growing at
an order smaller than square root of the prime. However computations of SOS-4
become intractable with respect to large graphs. Gvozdenovic et al. introduced
a more computationally efficient block-diagonal hierarchy of SDPs that refines
the SOS hierarchy. They computed the values of these SDPs of degrees 2 and 3
(L2 and L3 respectively) for the Paley graph clique numbers associated with
primes p less or equal to 809. These values bound from the above the values of
the corresponding SOS-4 and SOS-6 relaxations respectively. We revisit these
computations and determine the values of the L2 relaxation for larger p's. Our
results provide additional numerical evidence that the L2 relaxations, and
therefore also the SOS-4 relaxations, are asymptotically growing at an order
smaller than the square root of p.

batteries, the most ubiquitous solution, are insufficient for large-scale
applications, so sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), an alternative, are of great
current interest. To design and synthesise a commercially viable SIB with
required performance, a fundamental understanding of the materials is
imperative. Neutron diffraction and spectroscopy provide a unique insight of
atomistic understanding of structure and dynamics in materials, therefore in
this perspective we have explored how these techniques have been used in SIB
research. As neutrons have high penetrability in materials and neutron-matter
interaction probabilities are independent of the atomic number, they can
provide unique information about motion of particles in bulk materials in the
pico- to nanosecond time scales. This makes neutron scattering techniques
important tools in battery research. Sodium has a low neutron cross section,
which makes computational simulations essential for analysing neutron
scattering data of SIB materials. With the availability of high flux neutron
sources, high resolution instruments and high performance computers and
simulations tools, neutron spectroscopy has been an emerging technique in the
last decade for SIB research. In this perspective, we have shown that neutron
diffraction is the most popular, while neutron spectroscopies, are just
emerging. Computational simulation methods, both force field based and from
first principles, are common but still are mostly used independent of neutron
experiments. We have identified that suitable improvements of instrumentation,
sample environments and simulations methodology will allow these techniques to
be more accessible in future.

accelerate the computational efforts, we review two recent publications, the
first on a cellular-based model for tissues and the second on a cell nucleus
model consisting of chromatin and a lamina shell. We then give a perspective on
how the two models can be combined to test multiscale hypotheses linking the
chromatin scale and the tissue scale. To be concrete, we turn to an in vitro
system for the brain known as a brain organoid. We provide a multiscale
hypothesis to distinguish structural differences between brain organoids built
from induced-pluripotent human stem cells and from induced-pluripotent gorilla
and chimpanzee stem cells. Recent experiments discover that a cell fate
transition from neuroepithelial cells to radial glial cells includes a new
intermediate state that is delayed in human-derived brain organoids as compared
to their genetically-close relatives, which significantly narrows and lengthens
the cells on the apical side [1]. Additional experiments revealed that the
protein ZEB2 plays a major role in the emergence of this new intermediate state
with ZEB2 mRNA levels peaking at the onset of the emergence [1]. We postulate
that the enhancement of ZEB2 expression driving this intermediate state is
potentially due to chromatin reorganization. More precisely, there exists
critical strain triggering the reorganization that is higher for human-derived
stem cells, thereby resulting in a delay. Such a hypothesis can readily be
tested experimentally within individual cells and within brain organoids as
well as computationally to work towards solving the gene-to-tissue organization
puzzle.

needs to sum up infinite series of diagrams for both the fermionic self-energy
and the SDW order parameter in the SDW state or the magnetic correlation length
in the paramagnetic state. We use eikonal approach to sum up an infinite series
of diagrammatic contributions from thermal fluctuations. Earlier studies found
that in the SDW state, the spectral function $A_{\bf k} (\omega)$ of a hot
fermion at a finite $T$ is exponentially small below the energy scale $\Delta
(T)$, which scales with SDW order and vanishes at the ordering temperature
$T_N$, and has a hump at a larger frequency $\Delta_{\rm pg}$, comparable to
the zero-temperature SDW gap $\Delta (T=0)$. We argue that the hump, which we
associate with the pseudogap, survives in some $T$ range above $T_N$. We show
that this range is split by regions of strong and weak pseudogap behavior. In
the first region, $\Delta_{\rm pg}$ is weakly temperature dependent, despite
that it comes from thermal fluctuations. Such a behavior has been seen in
numerical studies of the Hubbard model. We show that to obtain it, one needs to
go beyond the one-loop approximation and sum up the infinite series of
diagrams. In the second regime, $\Delta_{\rm pg}$ decreases with increasing $T$
and eventually vanishes. We further argue that a magnetic pseudogap at a finite
$T$ emerges only if the ground state is magnetically ordered. We present the
phase diagram and apply the results to high-$T_c$ cuprates.

string edit distance problem. Given two ordered, edge-labeled trees $T_1$ and

total cost of operations that transform $T_1$ into $T_2$. In one operation, we
can contract an edge, split a vertex into two or change the label of an edge.
For the weighted version of the problem, where the cost of each operation
depends on the type of the operation and the label on the edge involved,
$\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ time algorithms are known for both rooted and unrooted
trees. The existence of a truly subcubic $\mathcal{O}(n^{3-\epsilon})$ time
algorithm is unlikely, as it would imply a truly subcubic algorithm for the
APSP problem. However, recently Mao (FOCS'21) showed that if we assume that
each operation has a unit cost, then the tree edit distance between two rooted
trees can be computed in truly subcubic time. In this paper, we show how to
adapt Mao's algorithm to make it work for unrooted trees and we show an

between two unrooted trees, where $\omega \leq 2.373$ is the matrix

Next, we prove a lower bound of $(\mu+1)d$ on the CR of any Any Fit packing

diminishes their data rates-even threatens basic connectivity requirements.
Given that UAVs have been regarded as an integral part of future generations of

corresponding dispersionless catastrophe time. The sign of the chirp appears to
determine the prevailing scenario among two competing mechanisms for rogue wave
formation. For negative values, the numerical simulations are suggestive of the
dispersive regularisation of a gradient catastrophe described by Bertola and
Tovbis for a different class of smooth, bell-shaped initial data. As the chirp
becomes positive, the rogue wave seems to result from the interaction of
counter-propagating dispersive dam break flows, as in the box problem recently

use a model biological system, the highly studied nematode worm C. elegans, and
a novel robophysical device whose bilateral actuator morphology models that of
limbless organisms across scales. The robot's kinematics quantitatively
reproduce the performance of the nematodes with purely open-loop control;
mechanical intelligence simplifies control of obstacle navigation and
exploitation by reducing the need for active sensing and feedback. An active
behavior observed in C. elegans, undulatory wave reversal upon head collisions,
robustifies locomotion via exploitation of the systems' mechanical
intelligence. Our study provides insights into how neurally simple limbless

which makes it possible to confront eJBD-based cosmology with observational and

to avoid serious conflict that may arise from standard lagrangian transformed
from the Jordan frame. Independent conformal factors are assigned to each of
five gauge invariant pieces. The formulation is most unambiguously made
possible by defining fields having canonical kinetic terms that allow us to use
the canonical quantization rule of field theory. This construction gives as one
of its consequences the canonical eJBD field $\chi$ that couples to the
universal fermion current, a linear combination of baryon and lepton number

equation of eJBD field along with gravitational equation is analyzed by using a

(AE) and other multi-modal sensor data collected in a hybrid directed energy
deposition (DED) process to the pore formations at high spatial (0.5 mm) and
time (< 1ms) resolutions. Adapting an explainable AI method in LIME (Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations), certain high-frequency waveform
signatures of AE are to be attributed to two major pathways for pore formation
in a DED process, namely, spatter events and insufficient fusion between
adjacent printing tracks from low heat input. This approach opens an exciting
possibility to predict, in real-time, the presence of a pore in every voxel
(0.5 mm in size) as they are printed, a major leap forward compared to prior
efforts. Synchronized multimodal sensor data including force, AE, vibration and
temperature were gathered while an SS316L material sample was printed and
subsequently machined. A deep convolution neural network classifier was used to
identify the presence of pores on a voxel surface based on time-frequency
patterns (spectrograms) of the sensor data collected during the process chain.
The results suggest signals collected during DED were more sensitive compared
to those from machining for detecting porosity in voxels (classification test
accuracy of 87%). The underlying explanations drawn from LIME analysis suggests
that energy captured in high frequency AE waveforms are 33% lower for porous
voxels indicating a relatively lower laser-material interaction in the melt
pool, and hence insufficient fusion and poor overlap between adjacent printing
tracks. The porous voxels for which spatter events were prevalent during
printing had about 27% higher energy contents in the high frequency AE band
compared to other porous voxels. These signatures from AE signal can further
the understanding of pore formation from spatter and insufficient fusion.

previous works that train networks to produce shared embedding directly between
the 2D image and 3D point cloud, we transform both data into 2.5D depth images

this end, LiDAR measurements are expressed in the form of range images before
matching them to reduce the modality discrepancy. Subsequently, the network is
trained to extract localization descriptors from disparity and range images.
Next, the best matches are employed as a loop factor in a pose graph. Using

on the formation and shaping of the PN itself. Stellar systems with longer
period create less entwined 3D spirals, producing PNe with rounder inner
cavities, and prevent the expansion of jet towards the polar directions. The
spiral fitting procedure used in the literature to predict the binary's orbital
period may be misleading in the case of proto-PNe and PNe as spiral patterns
are diluted by their own thermal expansion down to the average AGB density
profile within a few hundred years and are further disrupted by the action of
jets. By adopting a phase of jet ejections between the AGB and post-AGB stages,
we are able to recover the morphologies of proto-PNe and PNe that exhibit
ring-like structures in their halos.

For maps to have utility in a broad application space (including domain
translation, domain adaptation, and generative modeling), the map must be
available to apply on out-of-sample data points and should correspond to a
probabilistic model over the two spaces. Unfortunately, existing approaches,
which are primarily based on optimal transport, do not address these needs. In
this paper, we introduce a novel pushforward map learning algorithm that
utilizes normalizing flows to parameterize the map. We first re-formulate the
classical optimal transport problem to be map-focused and propose a learning
algorithm to select from all possible maps under the constraint that the map
minimizes a probability distance and application-specific regularizers; thus,
our method can be seen as solving a modified optimal transport problem. Once
the map is learned, it can be used to map samples from a source domain to a
target domain. In addition, because the map is parameterized as a composition
of normalizing flows, it models the empirical distributions over the two data
spaces and allows both sampling and likelihood evaluation for both data sets.
We compare our method (parOT) to related optimal transport approaches in the
context of domain adaptation and domain translation on benchmark data sets.
Finally, to illustrate the impact of our work on applied problems, we apply
parOT to a real scientific application: spectral calibration for

of cold-atom condensates at thermal equilibrium in the framework of
Bogoliubov's celebrated theory of the weakly interacting Bose gas. Bogoliubov
excitations were also found to be highly relevant to driven-dissipative quantum
fluid of light, with certain resulting phenomena strikingly analogue to their

the elementary excitations in a quantum fluid of light result dominantly from
their interaction with thermal lattice phonons, namely the elementary

predicted spectral function of the driven-dissipative quantum fluid we achieve
a quantitative understanding of the particle-hole nature of the elementary
excitations, and unveil a remarkable decoupling from thermal excitations which
is expected to be relevant in equilibrium quantum fluids as well. Finally, we
exploit this quantitative understanding to identify a crossover temperature
around $1\,$K, below which the lattice phonons are sufficiently quieted down
for the quantum fluctuations to take over in the generation of Bogoliubov
excitations. This regime is highly desired as it is characterized by strong
quantum correlations between Bogoliubov excitations.

streaks - coherent elongated regions of streamwise velocity. The unprecedented
streamwise length - until $x/D \approx 120$ - of the simulation enables
investigation of the near and far wake. The near wake is dominated by the
vortex shedding (VS) mode residing at azimuthal wavenumber $m=1$ and Strouhal
number $\textit{St} = 0.135$. After filtering out the VS structure, conclusive
evidence of large-scale streaks with frequency $\textit{St} \rightarrow 0$,
equivalently streamwise wavenumber $k_x \rightarrow 0$ in the wake, becomes
apparent in visualizations and spectra. These streaky structures are found
throughout the simulation domain beyond $x/D \approx 10$. Conditionally
averaged streamwise vorticity fields reveal that the lift-up mechanism is
active in the near as well as the far wake, and that ejections contribute more
than sweep to events of intense $-u'_xu'_r$. Spectral proper orthogonal
decomposition (SPOD) is employed to extract the energy and the spatiotemporal
features of the large-scale streaks. The streak energy is concentrated in the
$m=2$ azimuthal mode over the entire domain. Finally, bispectral mode
decomposition (BMD) is conducted to reveal strong interaction between $m=1$ and
$\textit{St} = \pm 0.135$ modes to give the $m=2, \textit{St} = 0$ streak mode.
Our results indicate that the self-interaction of the VS mode generates the
$m=2, \textit{St} = 0$ streamwise vortices, which leads to streak formation

that reports and characterizes large-scale low-frequency streaks and the

nature of P2P storage systems (which consist of heterogeneous nodes) introduce
however data placement challenges that create implementation trade-offs (e.g.,
between performance and scalability). Existing Kademlia-based DHT data
placement method stores data at closest node, where the distance is measured by
bit-wise XOR operation between data and a given node. This approach is highly
scalable because it does not require global knowledge for placing data nor for
the data retrieval. It does not however consider the heterogeneous performance
of the nodes, which can result in imbalanced resource usage affecting the
overall latency of the system. Other works implement criteria-based selection
that addresses heterogeneity of nodes, however often cause subsequent data
retrieval to require global knowledge of where the data stored. This paper
introduces Residual Performance-based Data Placement (RPDP), a novel data
placement method based on dynamic temporal residual performance of data nodes.
RPDP places data to most appropriate selected nodes based on their throughput
and latency with the aim to achieve lower overall latency by balancing data
distribution with respect to the individual performance of nodes. RPDP relies
on Kademlia-based DHT with modified data structure to allow data subsequently
retrieved without the need of global knowledge. The experimental results
indicate that RPDP reduces the overall latency of the baseline Kademlia-based

robotic arm was designed to mimic the therapist arm function to provide balance

movements and gait patterns, the robot must have a Human-Robot Interface(HRI)
that can detect user intention accurately and follow the user's movement
smoothly and timely. Thus, a graceful user following control rule was proposed.
The overall control architecture consists of two parts: an observer for human
inputs estimation and an LQR-based controller with disturbance rejection. The
proposed controller is validated in high-fidelity simulation with actual human
trajectories, and the results successfully show the effectiveness of the method
in different walking modes.

PBFT and RAFT rarely consider the channel performance of the physical layer,
such as path loss and channel fading, resulting in research results that are
far from real networks. Additionally, 6G communications will widely deploy
high-frequency signals such as terahertz (THz) and millimeter wave (mmWave),
while performances of PBFT and RAFT are still unknown when these signals are
transmitted in wireless PBFT or RAFT networks. Therefore, it is urgent to study
the performance of non-ideal wireless PBFT and RAFT networks with THz and
mmWave signals, to better make PBFT and RAFT play a role in the 6G era. In this
paper, we study and compare the performance of THz and mmWave signals in
non-ideal wireless PBFT and RAFT networks, considering Rayleigh Fading (RF) and
close-in Free Space (FS) reference distance path loss. Performance is evaluated
by five metrics: consensus success rate, latency, throughput, reliability gain,
and energy consumption. Meanwhile, we find and derive that there is a maximum
distance between two nodes that can make CMs inevitably successful, and it is
named the active distance of CMs. The research results not only analyze the
performance of non-ideal wireless PBFT and RAFT networks, but also provide
important references for the future transmission of THz and mmWave signals in

complex ambiguity in these scenes violates the multi-view consistency, then
makes it challenging for recent methods to reconstruct target objects
correctly. To remedy this issue, we present a novel surface reconstruction
framework, NeuS-HSR, based on implicit neural rendering. In NeuS-HSR, the
object surface is parameterized as an implicit signed distance function (SDF).
To reduce the interference of HSR, we propose decomposing the rendered image
into two appearances: the target object and the auxiliary plane. We design a
novel auxiliary plane module by combining physical assumptions and neural
networks to generate the auxiliary plane appearance. Extensive experiments on

software for remote diagnosis is a technical development trend and has
important practical value. Among voice diseases, common diseases that cause
hoarseness include spasmodic dysphonia, vocal cord paralysis, vocal nodule, and
vocal cord polyp. This paper presents a voice disease detection method that can
be applied in a wide range of clinical. We cooperated with Xiangya Hospital of
Central South University to collect voice samples from sixty-one different
patients. The Mel Frequency Cepstrum Coefficient (MFCC) parameters are
extracted as input features to describe the voice in the form of data. An
innovative model combining MFCC parameters and single convolution layer CNN is
proposed for fast calculation and classification. The highest accuracy we
achieved was 92%, it is fully ahead of the original research results and
internationally advanced. And we use Advanced Voice Function Assessment
Databases (AVFAD) to evaluate the generalization ability of the method we
proposed, which achieved an accuracy rate of 98%. Experiments on clinical and

our method has greatly improved in accuracy and computational efficiency.

role in fraud detection, health care, intrusion detection, military
surveillance, etc. As one of the most commonly used unsupervised anomaly
detection algorithms, the Local Outlier Factor algorithm (LOF algorithm) has
been extensively studied. This algorithm contains three steps, i.e.,
determining the k-distance neighborhood for each data point x, computing the
local reachability density of x, and calculating the local outlier factor of x
to judge whether x is abnormal. The LOF algorithm is computationally expensive
when processing big data sets. Here we present a quantum LOF algorithm
consisting of three parts corresponding to the classical algorithm.
Specifically, the k-distance neighborhood of x is determined by amplitude
estimation and minimum search; the local reachability density of each data
point is calculated in parallel based on the quantum multiply-adder; the local
outlier factor of each data point is obtained in parallel using amplitude
estimation. It is shown that our quantum algorithm achieves exponential speedup
on the dimension of the data points and polynomial speedup on the number of
data points compared to its classical counterpart. This work demonstrates the
advantage of quantum computing in unsupervised anomaly detection.

continually self-optimize through internal adaptivity across length scales,
from cytoplasm and biofilms to animal herds. Recent interest in such
material-based computation uses the principles of energy minimization, inertia

can be performed using dynamical systems, current implementations of material
computation lack the ability to self-learn. In particular, the inverse problem
of designing self-learning mechanical systems which can use physical

introduce the concept of self-learning mechanical circuits, capable of taking
mechanical inputs from changing environments and constantly updating their
internal state in response, thus representing an entirely mechanical
information processing unit. Our circuits are composed of a new mechanical
construct: an adaptive directed spring (ADS), which changes its stiffness in a
directional manner, enabling neural network-like computations. We provide both
a theoretical foundation and experimental realization of these elastic learning
units and demonstrate their ability to autonomously uncover patterns hidden in
environmental inputs. By implementing computations in an embodied physical
manner, the system directly interfaces with its environment, thus broadening
the scope of its learning behavior. Our results pave the way towards the
construction of energy-harvesting, adaptive materials which can autonomously

variation in small scale energy noted for canonical wall flows. The datasets
considered include those from a well-resolved numerical simulation (Pozuelo et

conditions across 1000 $\lesssim$ $Re_{\tau}$ $\lesssim$ 2000, with a
well-defined flow history, and a new high-$Re_{\tau}$ ($\sim$ 7000)
experimental study from the large Melbourne wind tunnel, with its long test
section modified to permit development of an APG TBL from a 'canonical'
upstream condition. The decrease in small scale energy with $Re_{\tau}$ is
revealed via decomposing the streamwise normal stresses into small and large
scale contributions, based on a sharp spectral cut-off. The origin for this
trend is traced back to the production of turbulent kinetic energy in an APG
TBL, the small scale contribution to which is also found to decrease with
$Re_{\tau}$ in the outer region. The conclusion is reaffirmed by investigating
attenuation of streamwise normal stresses due to changing spatial-resolutions
of the numerical grid/hotwire sensors, which reduces with increasing
$Re_{\tau}$ and is found to be negligible at $Re_{\tau}$ $\sim$ 7000 in this

stacks keep shadow copies of function return addresses and, when protected from
illegal modifications and coupled with forward-edge control-flow integrity,
form an effective and proven defense against such attacks. However, AArch64
lacks native support for write-protected shadow stacks, while software
alternatives either incur prohibitive performance overhead or provide weak
security guarantees.
  We present InversOS, the first hardware-assisted write-protected shadow
stacks for AArch64 user-space applications, utilizing commonly available
features of AArch64 to achieve efficient intra-address space isolation (called
Privilege Inversion) required to protect shadow stacks. Privilege Inversion
adopts unconventional design choices that run protected applications in the
kernel mode and mark operating system (OS) kernel memory as user-accessible;
InversOS therefore uses a novel combination of OS kernel modifications,
compiler transformations, and another AArch64 feature to ensure the safety of
doing so and to support legacy applications. We show that InversOS is secure by
design, effective against various control-flow hijacking attacks, and
performant on selected benchmarks and applications (incurring overhead of 7.0%

heavier Higgsinos decay instantly into the lightest one, with very little
activities. Hence, all pair-produced Higgsinos end up as a pair of the lightest
neutral Higgsinos, possibly long lived and decaying into the gravitino and
either the Higgs or the Z boson. If they decay inside the detectors, these
bosons deposit huge energies in the calorimeters. The cross section $\sigma_2$
($\sigma_1$) for the events with two (at least one) decaying-in-flight lightest

almost insensitive to the lightest Higgsino lifetime, thereby providing a good
variable to measure its mass. The ratio $\sigma_1/\sigma_2$, instead, mildly
dependent on its mass, can give good information on its lifetime. It is argued
that the lightest Higgsinos in the events are rather slow, as the very
relativistic ones escape away. Thus, the initial state radiations tend to be
soft and a trigger system appropriate for such events is necessary to detect
them.

heterostructures under different photoexcitation energies and stacking
sequences by comprehensive ultrafast means, including time-resolved terahertz

generates hot electron injection from graphene into the MoS2 layer with
photoexcitation of sub-A-exciton of MoS2, while the interfacial charge
separation in the MoS2/Gr could be partially blocked by the electric field of
substrate. Charge transfer (CT) occurs in same directions for the Gr-MoS2
heterostructures with opposite stacking order, resulting in the opposite

self-consistent one-zone leptonic model to understand the origin of the hard
X-ray excess in Mrk 421 during the period of extremely low X-ray and very high
energy (VHE) flux in 2013 January. In the model, two populations of
mono-energetic ultrarelativistic electrons are injected into the emission

numerically calculate the emitting electron energy distribution by solving a
kinetic equation that incorporates both shock acceleration and stochastic
acceleration processes. Moreover, we infer analytic expressions relating
electrons acceleration, cooling, escape and injection to the observed spectra

approximate analytical expression for the case of continual injection with a
mono-energetic distribution. Based on a comparison between the theoretical

observed in Mrk 421 may be due to the synchrotron radiation emitted by an

ranging from domination by a few giant companies to markets in which there are
many small firms. These market structures evolve in time, and may remain stable
for many years before experiencing a disruption in which a new firm emerges and
rapidly obtains a large market share. We seek the simplest realistic model
giving rise to such diverse market structures and dynamics. We focus on markets
in which every client adopts a single firm, and can, from time to time, switch
to a different firm. The markets of cell phone and Internet service providers
are examples. In the model, the size of a particular firm, labelled i, is equal
to its current number of clients, ni. In every step of the simulation, a client
is chosen at random, and then selects a firm from among the full set of firms
with probability pi = (beta + ni^alpha)/K, where K is the normalization factor.
Our model thus has two parameters: alpha represents the degree to which firm
size is an advantage (alpha > 1) or disadvantage (alpha < 1), relative to
strict proportionality to size (alpha = 1), and beta represents the degree to
which small firms are viable despite their small size. We postulate that alpha
and beta are determined by the regulatory, technology, business culture and
social environments. The model exhibits a phase diagram in the parameter space,
with different regions of behaviour. In one region, oligopolies form in which a
few large firms evenly split the market. In another, the market is divided into
several firms with clearly defined ranks. (...) We compare the model to the
markets of cell phone service providers in Germany and Canada, and find that it
correctly predicts that the leader firm of the German market changes more often
compared to leader firm changes in Canada, which is a more stable market.

gravitational potential of the cluster, which is dominated by the host dark
matter halo. Changes in halo concentration therefore impact the SZ signal, with
implications for cosmological and other analyses of SZ-selected clusters. We
investigate the concentration-SZ relation in theory and simulations. We find
that the impact of concentration on the inner SZ profile ($R \lesssim 0.75
R_{200c}$) can be captured with standard polytropic gas models. However, we
find that such models do a poor job of reproducing the outer SZ profiles ($R
\gtrsim 0.75 R_{200c}$) and the relation between the integrated SZ signal, $Y$,
and concentration. This disagreement results from a sharp truncation of the gas
pressure profile near the splashback radius, likely caused by virial shocks. We
develop a simple description of the truncation that leads to a good match with
simulated SZ profiles out to several $R_{200c}$ for clusters of varying mass
and concentration, and that also accurately predicts the concentration-$Y$
relationship. Finally, we determine how inference of the linear bias parameter
and splashback radius for SZ-selected clusters can be biased by ignoring the
concentration dependence of the SZ signal.

tackling this problem is through leveraging large unlabeled datasets that have
many behaviors in them and then adapting a policy to a specific task using a
small amount of task-specific human supervision (i.e. interventions or
demonstrations). However, how best to leverage the narrow task-specific
supervision and balance it with offline data remains an open question. Our key
insight in this work is that task-specific data not only provides new data for
an agent to train on but can also inform the type of prior data the agent
should use for learning. Concretely, we propose a simple approach that uses a
small amount of downstream expert data to selectively query relevant behaviors
from an offline, unlabeled dataset (including many sub-optimal behaviors). The
agent is then jointly trained on the expert and queried data. We observe that
our method learns to query only the relevant transitions to the task, filtering
out sub-optimal or task-irrelevant data. By doing so, it is able to learn more
effectively from the mix of task-specific and offline data compared to naively
mixing the data or only using the task-specific data. Furthermore, we find that

of Raz (SIAM J. Comput., 1998), which implies NP-hardness of Label Cover within
any constant factor, produces strong inapproximability results for many NP-hard
problems, one may think of using Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration to derive
inapproximability results for reconfiguration problems. We prove the following
results on Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration, which display different trends
from those of Label Cover and the parallel repetition theorem:
  (1) Maxmin Label Cover Reconfiguration can be approximated within a factor of
nearly $\frac{1}{4}$ for restricted graph classes, including slightly dense

Subsequent investigations have revealed an extensive form of sampling bias

""WEIRD"": Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, and Democratic. Recent work has
indicated that this pattern exists within human-computer interaction (HCI)
research, as well. How then does human-robot interaction (HRI) fare? And could
there be other patterns of sampling bias at play, perhaps those especially
relevant to this field of study? We conducted a systematic review of the
premier ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction
(2006-2022) to discover whether and how WEIRD HRI research is. Importantly, we
expanded our purview to other factors of representation highlighted by critical
work on inclusion and intersectionality as potentially underreported,
overlooked, and even marginalized factors of human diversity. Findings from 827
studies across 749 papers confirm that participants in HRI research also tend
to be drawn from WEIRD populations. Moreover, we find evidence of limited,
obscured, and possible misrepresentation in participant sampling and reporting
along key axes of diversity: sex and gender, race and ethnicity, age, sexuality

asymptotically AdS black hole solution of the gauged
Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) theory, the dyonic Kerr-Sen-AdS$_4$ black
hole, perturbed by rotating and charged shock waves along the equator. The
leading term of the scrambling time for a black hole with large entropy is
logarithmic in the entropy and hence supports the fast scrambling conjecture
for this black hole solution, which implies that the system under consideration
is chaotic. We also find that the instantaneous minimal Lyapunov index is
bounded by $\kappa=2\pi T_H/(1-\mu\mathcal{L})$, which is analogous to the
surface gravity but for the rotating shock waves, and becomes closer to
equality for the near extremal black hole. For a small value of the AdS scale,
we found that the Lyapunov exponent can exceed the bound for a large value of
$\mathcal{L}$. Due to the presence of the electric and magnetic charge of the
shock waves, we also show that the scrambling process of this holographic
system is delayed by a time scale that depends on the charges of the shock
waves. The calculations also hold for the ultra-spinning version of this black
hole. The result of this paper generalizes the holographic calculations of
chaotic systems which are described by an EMDA theory in the bulk.

to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity. The violation as an operator
is equivalent to violation of Abelian-like Bianchi identities corresponding to
eight Abelian-like conserved magnetic monopole currents of the Dirac type in
$SU(3)$ QCD. It is very interesting to study if these new Abelian-like
monopoles are responsible for color confinement in the continuum $SU(3)$ QCD,
since any reliable candidate of color magnetic monopoles is not known yet. If
these new Abelian-like monopoles exist in the continuum limit, the Abelian dual
Meissner effect occurs, so that the linear part of the static potential between
a quark-antiquark pair is reproduced fully by those of Abelian and monopole
static potentials. These phenomena are called here as perfect Abelian and
monopole dominances. It is shown that the perfect Abelian dominance is
reproduced fairly well, whereas the perfect monopole dominance seems to be
realized for large $\beta$ when use is made of the smooth lattice
configurations in the maximally Abelian (MA) gauge. Making use of a block spin
transformation with respect to monopoles, the scaling behaviors of the monopole
density and the effective monopole action are studied. Both monopole density
and the effective monopole action which are usually a two-point function of
$\beta$ and the number of times $n$ of the block spin transformation are a
function of $b=na(\beta)$ alone for $n=1,2,3,4,6,8,12$. If the scaling behavior
is seen for up to larger $n$, it shows the existence of the continuum limit,
since $a(\beta)\to 0$ when $n\to\infty$ for fixed $b=na(\beta)$. Along with the
previous results without any gauge fixing, these new results obtained in MA
gauge suggest that the new Abelian-like monopoles play the role of color

outperforms FourCastNet in precipitation forecasting. In the setting where the

classification then enables the real space segmentation via a density based

switching cannot be achieved by unlimitedly increasing the current. By
systematically studying the impact of thermal fluctuations, we find the
dynamics of FiMs can also be distinguished into the precessional region, the
thermally activated region, and the cross-over region. However, in the
precessional region, there is a significant deviation between FiM and
ferromagnet (FM), i.e., the FM is insensitive to thermal fluctuations since its
switching is only determined by the amount of net charge. In contrast, we find
that the thermal effect is pronounced even a very short current pulse is
applied to the FiM. We attribute this anomalous effect to the complex relation
between the anisotropy and overdrive current. By controlling the magnetic

the extended KdV equation reduces to standard KdV equation for small amplitude
of the waves. We have also generalized the extended KdV equation for describing
the decaying effect of the waves. Quasi-periodic and solitary wave solutions
for extended KdV equation with decaying effect are found as well. We also

requirements of the environment, specifying agent configurations that are
representative of dynamics at real world stores and warehouses, and specifying
a reward framework that encourages desirable behavior across the whole supply

architecture for agent-environment dynamics incorporating enhanced state and
action spaces, and a shared reward specification that seeks to optimize for a
large retailer's supply chain needs. Each vertex in the supply chain graph is
an independent agent that, based on its own inventory, able to place
replenishment orders to the vertex upstream. The warehouse agent, aside from
placing orders from the supplier, has the special property of also being able
to constrain replenishment to stores downstream, which results in it learning
an additional allocation sub-policy. We achieve a system that outperforms
standard inventory control policies such as a base-stock policy and other
RL-based specifications for 1 product, and lay out a future direction of work

perform live transcription imaging of key developmental genes in the fly
embryo, with single polymerase sensitivity. Quantification of single allele
transcription rates and multi-polymerase bursts reveals shared bursting
relationships among all genes, across time and space, as well as cis- and
trans-perturbations. We identify the allele's ON-probability as the main
determinant of the transcription rate, while changes in the transcription
initiation rate are limited. Any given ON-probability determines a specific
combination of mean ON and OFF times, preserving a constant characteristic
bursting time scale. Our findings point to a convergence of various regulatory
processes that predominantly affect the ON-probability, thereby controlling
mRNA production rather than mechanism-specific modulation of ON and OFF times.
Our results thus motivate and guide new investigations into the mechanisms

is based on a set of MHD simulations performed by the code PLUTO reproducing
the space weather conditions expected for exoplanets orbiting the habitable

au are protected from the stellar wind during regular and CME-like space
weather conditions if the star rotation period is slower than 3 days, that is
to say, faster rotators generate stellar winds and interplanetary magnetic
fields large enough to endanger the exoplanet habitability. Exoplanets hosted
by a F stars type tau Boo at >= 2.5 au are protected during regular space
weather conditions, but a stronger magnetic field compared to the Earth is
mandatory if the exoplanet is close to the inner edge of the star habitable
zone (2.5 au) to shield the exoplanet surface during CME-like space weather
conditions. The range of radio emission values calculated in the simulations
are consistent with the scaling proposed by [Zarka 2018] during regular and

Remarkably, it is currently still challenging to replicate even basic low-level

Specifically, it is difficult to incorporate the integral and derivative parts.
To address this problem, we propose a neuromorphic controller that incorporates
proportional, integral, and derivative pathways during learning. Our approach
includes a novel input threshold adaptation mechanism for the integral pathway.
This Input-Weighted Threshold Adaptation (IWTA) introduces an additional weight
per synaptic connection, which is used to adapt the threshold of the
post-synaptic neuron. We tackle the derivative term by employing neurons with
different time constants. We first analyze the performance and limits of the
proposed mechanisms and then put our controller to the test by implementing it
on a microcontroller connected to the open-source tiny Crazyflie quadrotor,
replacing the innermost rate controller. We demonstrate the stability of our
bio-inspired algorithm with flights in the presence of disturbances. The
current work represents a substantial step towards controlling highly dynamic

three aspects. Firstly, we upgrade the original architecture by adopting a
hierarchical encoder-decoder structure for multi-scale representation
extraction and parsing. Secondly, we reformulate the pixel-wise mapping
relationship between the unrestricted distorted document images and the
distortion-free counterparts. The obtained data is used to train our DocTr++

real-world test set and metrics applicable for evaluating the rectification
quality. To our best knowledge, this is the first learning-based method for the
rectification of unrestricted document images. Extensive experiments are
conducted, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
method. We hope our DocTr++ will serve as a strong baseline for generic

relation by the well-designed GCNs or Transformers. For example, to infer the
actor interaction relation, GCNs need a learnable adjacency, and Transformers
need to calculate the self-attention. Although the above methods can model the
interaction relation effectively, they also increase the complexity of the
model (the number of parameters and computations). In this paper, we design a
novel MLP-based method for Actor Interaction Relation learning (MLP-AIR) in
GAR. Compared with GCNs and Transformers, our method has a competitive but
conceptually and technically simple alternative, significantly reducing the
complexity. Specifically, MLP-AIR includes three sub-modules: MLP-based Spatial

(MLP-T), and MLP-based Relation refining module (MLP-R). MLP-S is used to model
the spatial relation between different actors in each frame. MLP-T is used to
model the temporal relation between different frames for each actor. MLP-R is
used further to refine the relation between different dimensions of relation
features to improve the feature's expression ability. To evaluate the MLP-AIR,
we conduct extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, including the

that MLP-AIR can get competitive results but with low complexity.

often see that humans tend to over- or under-rely on AI recommendations,
meaning that they either adhere to wrong or override correct recommendations.
Such reliance behavior is detrimental to decision-making accuracy. In this
work, we articulate and analyze the interdependence between reliance behavior
and accuracy in AI-assisted decision-making, which has been largely neglected
in prior work. We also propose a visual framework to make this interdependence
more tangible. This framework helps us interpret and compare empirical
findings, as well as obtain a nuanced understanding of the effects of
interventions (e.g., explanations) in AI-assisted decision-making. Finally, we
infer several interesting properties from the framework: (i) when humans
under-rely on AI recommendations, there may be no possibility for them to
complement the AI in terms of decision-making accuracy; (ii) when humans cannot
discern correct and wrong AI recommendations, no such improvement can be
expected either; (iii) interventions may lead to an increase in decision-making
accuracy that is solely driven by an increase in humans' adherence to AI
recommendations, without any ability to discern correct and wrong. Our work
emphasizes the importance of measuring and reporting both effects on accuracy

operate at low energy, they suffer from slow dynamics, sensitivity to process
variations, and low fabrication yield. In this paper, we model a TRNG based on
medium-barrier magnets (MBMs) with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The
proposed MBM-based TRNG is driven with short voltage pulses to induce
ballistic, yet stochastic, magnetization switching. We show that the proposed
TRNG can operate at frequencies of about 500~MHz while consuming less than
100~fJ/bit of energy. In the short-pulse ballistic limit, the switching

constrained the complementary (quenched) cooling flow radius Rqcf, obtained via
the condition tcool=25Xtff, that encompasses the region of thermally unstable
cooling. We find that in our cluster sample and in the limited redshift range
considered (1.3E14<M500<16.6E14 Msun, 0.03<z<0.29), the distribution of Rccc
peaks at 0.01r500 and the entire range remains below 0.07r500, with a very weak
increase with redshift and no dependence on the cluster mass. We find that Rqcf
is typically 3 times larger than Rccc, with a wider distribution, and growing
more slowly along Rccc, according to an average relation Rqcf~Rccc^(0.46), with
a large intrinsic scatter. We suggest that this sublinear relation can be
understood as an effect of the micro rain of pockets of cooled gas flickering

the integration of generators in the RF systems of SPIDER and MITICA. Numerical
analyses were performed to verify the impact of harmonic distortion on
transmission line and RF load components, to address the effect of mutual
coupling between RF circuits on the generator output modulation, and to assess
the magnitude of common mode currents in the electric system. These studies, as
well as the experience gained from SPIDER operation, helped to define dedicated

  Instance Segmentation","Accepted by CVPR Workshops 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, instance segmentation has made great progress with the rapid
development of deep neural networks. However, there still exist two main
challenges including discovering indistinguishable objects and modeling the
relationship between instances. To deal with these difficulties, we propose a
novel object mining framework for instance segmentation. In this framework, we
first introduce the semantics perceiving subnetwork to capture pixels that may
belong to an obvious instance from the bottom up. Then, we propose an object
excavating mechanism to discover indistinguishable objects. In the mechanism,
preliminary perceived semantics are regarded as original instances with
classifications and locations, and then indistinguishable objects around these
original instances are mined, which ensures that hard objects are fully
excavated. Next, an instance purifying strategy is put forward to model the
relationship between instances, which pulls the similar instances close and
pushes away different instances to keep intra-instance similarity and
inter-instance discrimination. In this manner, the same objects are combined as
the one instance and different objects are distinguished as independent
instances. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset show that the proposed
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, which validates the
effectiveness of the proposed object mining framework.

collapse supernova explosion between them that forms the NS. Later the lower
mass star engulfs the NS as it becomes a red giant, a process that leads to the
second CEE phase and to the ejection of the envelope. This leaves a hot
horizontal branch star that evolves to become a helium WD and an expanding
nebula. Both the WD and the NS power the nebula. The NS in addition might power
a pulsar wind nebula inside the expanding PN. From our simulations we find that
the Galactic formation rate of NS-WD PNe is $1.8 \times 10^{-5} {\rm yr}^{-1}$
while the Galactic formation rate of all PNe is $0.42 {\rm yr}^{-1}$. There is
a possibility that one of the observed Galactic PNe might be a NS-WD PN, and a
few NS-WD PNe might exist in the Galaxy. The central binary systems might be
sources for future gravitational wave detectors like LISA, and possibly of

Corresponding to an intermediate value of $\alpha$, namely, 0 <$\alpha$< 1, the
energy levels become nondegenerate. The scenario remains unaltered when the
ring is threaded by a magnetic flux which is an integer multiple of the flux
quantum. We also calculate the persistent current which exhibits quantum
oscillations as a function of the magnetic field with a period of one flux
quantum at a particular Dirac point, which is often referred to as a valley.
The total current oscillates with a periodicity of one flux quantum for any
intermediate value of $\alpha$. We have also explored the effect of a mass term
(that breaks the sublattice symmetry) in the Hamiltonian. In the absence of a
magnetic field, the energy levels in the flat band become dispersive, except
for the m = 0 level in the case of $\alpha$ = 1. In presence of the field, each
of the flat band levels becomes dispersive for any $\alpha \neq$ 0. Finally, we
also see the effect of the mass term on the behaviour of the persistent

remains finite for all values of $\alpha$.

recommend that a subject who has been outdoors in sun re-acclimate to an indoor

insufficient for a rapid screening tool. Moreover, the error bias from solar

uses transient behavior of cooling to more quickly extrapolate the steady state

faulty sensors in industrial systems. Two types of sensor faults are
considered: complete failure and sensor deterioration. The proposed method is
applicable to general autonomous nonlinear systems without making any
assumptions about its triangular and/or normal form, which is usually
considered in the observer design literature. The key aspect of our approach is
a learning-based design of the Luenberger observer, which involves using a
neural network to approximate the injective map that transforms the nonlinear
system into a stable linear system with output injection. This learning-based
Luenberger observer accurately estimates the system's state, allowing for the
detection of sensor faults through residual generation. The residual is
computed as the norm of the difference between the system's measured output and
the observer's predicted output vectors. Fault isolation is achieved by
comparing each sensor's measurement with its corresponding predicted value. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing and isolating sensor
faults while remaining robust in the presence of measurement noise and system
uncertainty. We validate our method through numerical simulations of sensor
faults in a network of Kuramoto oscillators.

material from an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star, leading to the formation
of SNe Ia when the mass of the WD approaches to the Chandrasekhar-mass limit,
known as the AGB donor channel. In this channel, previous studies mainly
concentrate on the wind-accretion pathway for the mass-increase of the WDs. In
the present work, we employed an integrated mass-transfer prescription for the
semidetached WD+AGB systems, and evolved a number of WD+AGB systems for the
formation of SNe Ia through the Roche-lobe overflow process or the
wind-accretion process. We provided the initial and final parameter spaces of
WD+AGB systems for producing SNe Ia. We also obtained the density distribution
of circumstellar matter at the moment when the WD mass reaches the
Chandrasekhar-mass limit. Moreover, we found that the massive WD+AGB sample AT
2019qyl can be covered by the final parameter space for producing SNe Ia,

  However, the inherent intricacy and uncertainty in information dissemination
pose significant challenges, and the ill-posed nature of the source
localization problem further exacerbates these challenges. Recently, deep
generative models, particularly diffusion models inspired by classical
non-equilibrium thermodynamics, have made significant progress. While diffusion
models have proven to be powerful in solving inverse problems and producing
high-quality reconstructions, applying them directly to the source localization
is infeasible for two reasons. Firstly, it is impossible to calculate the
posterior disseminated results on a large-scale network for iterative denoising
sampling, which would incur enormous computational costs. Secondly, in the
existing methods for this field, the training data itself are ill-posed
(many-to-one); thus simply transferring the diffusion model would only lead to
local optima.
  To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage optimization framework,
the source localization denoising diffusion model (SL-Diff). In the coarse
stage, we devise the source proximity degrees as the supervised signals to
generate coarse-grained source predictions. This aims to efficiently initialize
the next stage, significantly reducing its convergence time and calibrating the
convergence process. Furthermore, the introduction of cascade temporal
information in this training method transforms the many-to-one mapping
relationship into a one-to-one relationship, perfectly addressing the ill-posed
problem. In the fine stage, we design a diffusion model for the graph inverse

machine learning model without sharing their data; rather, they train their own
model locally and send updates to a central server for aggregation. Depending
on how the data is distributed among the participants, FL can be classified
into Horizontal (HFL) and Vertical (VFL). In VFL, the participants share the
same set of training instances but only host a different and non-overlapping
subset of the whole feature space. Whereas in HFL, each participant shares the
same set of features while the training set is split into locally owned
training data subsets.
  VFL is increasingly used in applications like financial fraud detection;
nonetheless, very little work has analyzed its security. In this paper, we
focus on robustness in VFL, in particular, on backdoor attacks, whereby an
adversary attempts to manipulate the aggregate model during the training
process to trigger misclassifications. Performing backdoor attacks in VFL is
more challenging than in HFL, as the adversary i) does not have access to the

to the feature embeddings. We present a first-of-its-kind clean-label backdoor

different disorder profiles are mapped into a quantum ancilla. By preparing the
ancilla in a quantum superposition state, quantum parallelism can be harnessed
to obtain the ensemble average in a single computation run. In this work, we
modify this algorithm by performing a measurement on the ancilla. This enables
the determination of conditional dynamics not only by the ensemble average but
also by the quantum interference effect. Using a phenomenological analysis

video retargeting. This paper proposes an unsupervised deep learning-based
stereo video retargeting network. Our model first detects the salient objects
and shifts and warps all objects such that it minimizes the distortion of the
salient parts of the stereo frames. We use 1D convolution for shifting the
salient objects and design a stereo video Transformer to assist the retargeting
process. To train the network, we use the parallax attention mechanism to fuse
the left and right views and feed the retargeted frames to a reconstruction
module that reverses the retargeted frames to the input frames. Therefore, the
network is trained in an unsupervised manner. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments and ablation studies on KITTI stereo 2012 and 2015

four-dimensional experiments were conducted. Based on the experimental
analysis, the Random Forests algorithm is the most robust classifier in the
two-dimensional case, showing the lowest degradation rate for accuracy and

dynamics starting from unstable fixed points. In the TNT model, non-Gaussian
probe state evolves directly back to the vicinity of initial state during the
subsequent time-forward evolution for path recombining, accompanied by quantum
magnification of encoded signal and refocusing of the associated quantum noise.
Based on low-order moment measurement, we find the optimal metrological gain
nearly saturates the quantum Cramer-Rao bound (QCRB) and follows the Heisenberg
scaling. For the TACT case, the QCRB can also be nearly approached when the
state converges to either of the two unstable fixed points, respectively
corresponding to the initial state or its orthogonal coherent state. The latter
case goes beyond previous studies where tracing back to or crossing the initial
states is mostly considered. The present protocol does not require
time-reversal as in typical nonlinear interferometries, and it also avoids
complicated measurement of nonlinear observables or full probability
distributions. The operational approach we discuss presents a practical way for

output, i.e. when the decoder returns the estimated information word. At the
same time, soft-output decoding is of critical importance for iterative
receivers and decoders. In this paper, we focus on the soft-output DNN-based
decoding problem. We start with the syndrome-based approach proposed by
Bennatan et al. (2018) and modify it to provide soft output in the AWGN
channel. The new decoder can be considered as an approximation of the MAP
decoder with smaller computation complexity. We discuss various regularization
functions for joint DNN-MAP training and compare the resulting distributions
for [64, 45] BCH code. Finally, to demonstrate the soft-output quality we
consider the turbo-product code with [64, 45] BCH codes as row and column
codes. We show that the resulting DNN-based scheme is very close to the
MAP-based performance and significantly outperforms the solution based on the
Chase decoder. We come to the conclusion that the new method is prospective for
the challenging problem of DNN-based decoding of long codes consisting of short
component codes.

temperature-identification method, for detecting different types of phase
transitions in the XXZ models without prior knowledge of their critical
temperatures. The XXZ models have exchange couplings which are anisotropic in
the spin space where the strength is represented by a parameter $\Delta(>0)$.
The models exhibit the second-order phase transition when $\Delta>1$, whereas
the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition when $\Delta<1$. In
the phase-classification method, the neural network is trained using spin or
vortex configurations of well-known classical spin models other than the XXZ
models, e.g., the Ising models and the XY models, to classify those of the XXZ
models to corresponding phases. We demonstrate that the trained neural network
successfully detects the phase transitions for both $\Delta>1$ and $\Delta<1$,
and the evaluated critical temperatures coincide well with those evaluated by
conventional numerical calculations. In the temperature-identification method,
on the other hand, the neural network is trained so as to identify temperatures
at which the input spin or vortex configurations are generated by the Monte
Carlo thermalization. The critical temperatures are evaluated by analyzing the
optimized weight matrix, which coincide with the result of numerical
calculation for the second-order phase transition in the Ising-like XXZ model

the XY-like XXZ model with $\Delta=0.95$.

counter-free automata to star-free regular expressions and back to formulas. In
2020, Sickert and Esparza presented a direct and purely syntactic normalization
procedure for LTL yielding a normal form similar to the one by Chang, Manna,

e-commerce and streaming media recommendation scenarios and thus have become a
hot topic. The data encountered by SBRS is typically highly sparse, which also
serves as one of the bottlenecks limiting the accuracy of recommendations. So
Contrastive Learning(CL) is applied in SBRS owing to its capability of
improving embedding learning under the condition of sparse data. However,
existing CL strategies are limited in their ability to enforce finer-grained
(e.g., factor-level) comparisons and, as a result, are unable to capture subtle
differences between instances. More than that, these strategies usually use
item or segment dropout as a means of data augmentation which may result in
sparser data and thus ineffective self-supervised signals. By addressing the
two aforementioned limitations, we introduce a novel multi-granularity CL
framework. Specifically, two extra augmented embedding convolution channels
with different granularities are constructed and the embeddings learned by them
are compared with those learned from original view to complete the CL tasks. At
factor-level, we employ Disentangled Representation Learning to obtain
finer-grained data(e.g. factor-level embeddings), with which we can construct
factor-level convolution channels. At item-level, the star graph is deployed as
the augmented data and graph convolution on it can ensure the effectiveness of
self-supervised signals. Compare the learned embeddings of these two views with
the learned embeddings of the basic view to achieve CL at two granularities.
Finally, the more precise item-level and factor-level embeddings obtained are
referenced to generate personalized recommendations for the user. The proposed
model is validated through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets,
showcasing superior performance compared to existing methods.

object representation all in a dynamic manner to alleviate the mismatch issue.
For another, we leverage the coarse prior matching and finer posterior

a spherically symmetric non trivial geometry can be classified as complex or
non-complex based on the nature of the inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the
stress energy tensors with only homogeneous and isotropic matter distribution
leading to null complexity. Mathematically there was also another way of
obtaining zero complexity geometry. In this context since static traversable
wormhole by default is characterised by anisotropic and inhomogeneous matter
stress tensors, the question we answer is whether it is possible to obtain zero

AssemblyNet serves as NPS's graph model and neural architecture, capturing a

flow. AssemblyNet is trained with a data prefetch task that predicts
consecutive memory addresses.
  In the experiments, NPS outperforms SimPoint by up to 63%, reducing the
average error by 38%. Additionally, NPS demonstrates strong robustness with
increased accuracy, reducing the expensive accuracy tuning overhead.
Furthermore, NPS shows higher accuracy and generality than the state-of-the-art

placed in a bioreactor to undergo cyclic deformation. The first approach
demonstrated high cell viability, as cells migrated out of the spheroid and
colonised the interstitial space of the scaffold. These cells adopted an
elongated morphology suggesting the internal architecture of the scaffold

Such a transition in a magnetically ordered material could affect the magnetic

magnetization, experimental demonstration of such a process remains
challenging. Exciting a significant fraction of magnetic ions requires a very
intense incoming light beam, as orbital resonances are often weak compared to
above-band-gap excitations. In the latter case, a sizeable reduction of the
magnetization occurs as the absorbed energy increases the spin temperature,
masking the non-thermal optical effects. Here, using ultrafast x-ray
spectroscopy, we were able to resolve changes in the magnetization state
induced by resonant absorption of infrared photons in Co-doped yttrium iron

of the Co ions affects the two distinct magnetic Fe sublattices differently,
resulting in a transient non-collinear magnetic state. The present results
indicate that the all-optical magnetization switching most likely occurs due to
the creation of a transient, non-collinear magnetic state followed by coherent
spin rotations of the Fe moments.

promising optimal control direction for multi-energy management systems. It
only requires the environment-specific constraint functions itself a priori and
not a complete model (i.e. plant, disturbance and noise models, and prediction
models for states not included in the plant model - e.g. demand forecasts,
weather forecasts, price forecasts). The project-specific upfront and ongoing
engineering efforts are therefore still reduced, better representations of the
underlying system dynamics can still be learned and modelling bias is kept to a
minimum (no model-based objective function). However, even the constraint
functions alone are not always trivial to accurately provide in advance,
leading to potentially unsafe behaviour. In this paper, we present two novel
advancements: (I) combining the Optlayer and SafeFallback method, named
OptLayerPolicy, to increase the initial utility while keeping a high sample
efficiency. (II) introducing self-improving hard constraints, to increase the
accuracy of the constraint functions as more data becomes available so that
better policies can be learned. Both advancements keep the constraint
formulation decoupled from the RL formulation, so that new (presumably better)
RL algorithms can act as drop-in replacements. We have shown that, in a
simulated multi-energy system case study, the initial utility is increased to
92.4% (OptLayerPolicy) compared to 86.1% (OptLayer) and that the policy after
training is increased to 104.9% (GreyOptLayerPolicy) compared to 103.4%

surrogate functions into the optimization problem requires special attention,
we do conclude that the newly presented GreyOptLayerPolicy method is the most

the galaxies' 3D coordinates onto a 2D plane, we apply observational techniques
to find galaxy pairs. Based on a previous theoretical study on galaxy groups in
the same simulations, we are able to classify the observed pairs into ""true"" or
""false"", depending on whether they are gravitationally bound or not. We find
that the fraction of true pairs (purity) crucially depends on the specific
thresholds used to find the pairs, ranging from around 30 to more than 80 per
cent in the most restrictive case. Nevertheless, in these very restrictive
cases, we see that the completeness of the sample is low, failing to find a
significant number of true pairs. Therefore, we train a machine learning
algorithm to help us to identify these true pairs based on the properties of
the galaxies that constitute them. With the aid of the machine learning model
trained with a set of properties of all the objects, we show that purity and
completeness can be boosted significantly using the default observational
thresholds. Furthermore, this machine learning model also reveals the
properties that are most important when distinguishing true pairs, mainly the
size and mass of the galaxies, their spin parameter, gas content and shape of
their stellar components.

exists in an integrable model of spatially interacting linear kicked rotors.
Later, such localized phases in a non-integrable model -- coupled relativistic
kicked rotors -- were also shown to exist. However, the presence of dynamical
localization remains an open question in an interacting system that is far from
the integrable limit and hence is completely chaotic. In this work, we show
that chaos can be induced in the integrable linear kicked rotor model through
interactions between the momenta of rotors. An approximate estimate of its
Lyapunov exponent is obtained. Further, the quantum dynamics of this chaotic
model, upon variation of kicking and interaction strengths, is shown to exhibit
a variety of phases -- classically induced localization, dynamical
localization, subdiffusive and diffusive phases. We also discuss this
perspective from entanglement production in this system. By defining an

and several related quantities for polygonal meshes. The algebraic quadric
fitting curvature (AQFC) is based on local approximation of the mesh vertices
and associated normals by a quadratic surface. The quadric is computed as an
implicit surface, so it minimizes algebraic distances and normal deviations
from the approximated point-normal neighbourhood of the processed vertex. Its
mean and Gaussian curvature estimate is then obtained as the respective
curvature of its orthogonal projection onto the fitted quadratic surface.
Experimental results for both sampled parametric surfaces and arbitrary meshes
are provided. The proposed method AQFC approaches the true curvatures of the
reference smooth surfaces with increasing density of sampling, regardless of
its regularity. It is resilient to irregular sampling of the mesh, compared to
the contemporary curvature estimators. In the case of arbitrary meshes,
obtained from scanning, AQFC provides robust curvature estimation.

  Problems under Incomplete Observation",,,,,"math.OC q-fin.PM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A typical approach to tackle stochastic control problems with partial
observation is to separate the control and estimation tasks. However, it is
well known that this separation generally fails to deliver an actual optimal
solution for risk-sensitive control problems. This paper investigates the
separability of a general class of risk-sensitive investment management
problems when a finite-dimensional filter exists. We show that the
corresponding separated problem, where instead of the unobserved quantities,
one considers their conditional filter distribution given the observations, is
strictly equivalent to the original control problem. We widen the applicability
of the so-called Modified Zakai Equation (MZE) for the study of the separated
problem and prove that the MZE simplifies to a PDE in our approach.
Furthermore, we derive criteria for separability. We do not solve the separated
control problem but note that the existence of a finite-dimensional filter
leads to a finite state space for the separated problem. Hence, the difficulty
is equivalent to solving a complete observation risk-sensitive problem. Our
results have implications for existing risk-sensitive investment management
models with partial observations in that they establish their separability.
Their implications for future research on new applications is mainly to provide
conditions to ensure separability.

several information retrieval (IR) tasks. However, training NRMs often requires
large-scale training data, which is difficult and expensive to obtain. To
address this issue, one can train NRMs via weak supervision, where a large
dataset is automatically generated using an existing ranking model (called the
weak labeler) for training NRMs. Weakly supervised NRMs can generalize from the
observed data and significantly outperform the weak labeler. This paper
generalizes this idea through an iterative re-labeling process, demonstrating
that weakly supervised models can iteratively play the role of weak labeler and
significantly improve ranking performance without using manually labeled data.
The proposed Generalized Weak Supervision (GWS) solution is generic and
orthogonal to the ranking model architecture. This paper offers four
implementations of GWS: self-labeling, cross-labeling, joint cross- and
self-labeling, and greedy multi-labeling. GWS also benefits from a query
importance weighting mechanism based on query performance prediction methods to
reduce noise in the generated training data. We further draw a theoretical
connection between self-labeling and Expectation-Maximization. Our experiments

from data with mathematical expressions, which is considered an effective way
to reach interpretable machine learning (ML). Genetic programming (GP) has been
the dominator in solving SR problems. However, as the scale of SR problems
increases, GP often poorly demonstrates and cannot effectively address the
real-world high-dimensional problems. This limitation is mainly caused by the
stochastic evolutionary nature of traditional GP in constructing the trees. In
this paper, we propose a differentiable approach named DGP to construct GP
trees towards high-dimensional SR for the first time. Specifically, a new data
structure called differentiable symbolic tree is proposed to relax the discrete
structure to be continuous, thus a gradient-based optimizer can be presented
for the efficient optimization. In addition, a sampling method is proposed to
eliminate the discrepancy caused by the above relaxation for valid symbolic
expressions. Furthermore, a diversification mechanism is introduced to promote
the optimizer escaping from local optima for globally better solutions. With
these designs, the proposed DGP method can efficiently search for the GP trees
with higher performance, thus being capable of dealing with high-dimensional
SR. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DGP, we conducted various experiments
against the state of the arts based on both GP and deep neural networks. The
experiment results reveal that DGP can outperform these chosen peer competitors
on high-dimensional regression benchmarks with dimensions varying from tens to
thousands. In addition, on the synthetic SR problems, the proposed DGP method
can also achieve the best recovery rate even with different noisy levels. It is
believed this work can facilitate SR being a powerful alternative to
interpretable ML for a broader range of real-world problems.

This work demonstrates formulating quantum SISR as a sparse coding optimization

compared to virtual machines has led to the rapid uptake of another in recent
years, called Containers as a Service (CaaS), which falls between IaaS and PaaS
regarding control abstraction. However, when CaaS is offered to multiple

aggregation perturbation technique to ensure differential privacy, ProGAP
splits a GNN into a sequence of overlapping submodels that are trained
progressively, expanding from the first submodel to the complete model.
Specifically, each submodel is trained over the privately aggregated node
embeddings learned and cached by the previous submodels, leading to an
increased expressive power compared to previous approaches while limiting the
incurred privacy costs. We formally prove that ProGAP ensures edge-level and

evaluate its performance on benchmark graph datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that ProGAP can achieve up to 5%-10% higher accuracy than existing

where a dynamically varying team of autonomous agents cooperate in order to
search multiple objects of interest in three-dimension (3-D). It is assumed
that the agents can enter and exit the mission space at any point in time, and
as a result the number of agents that actively participate in the mission
varies over time. The proposed distributed search-planning framework takes into
account the agent dynamical and sensing model, and the dynamically varying
number of agents, and utilizes model predictive control (MPC) to generate
cooperative search trajectories over a finite rolling planning horizon. This
enables the agents to adapt their decisions on-line while considering the plans
of their peers, maximizing their search planning performance, and reducing the
duplication of work.

passive glass-forming materials, is enjoying increasing scientific interest. To
better grasp the subtle effect of active motion on the process of
vitrification, a number of active mode-coupling theories (MCTs) have recently
been developed. These have proven capable of qualitatively predicting important
parts of the active glassy phenomenology. However, most efforts so far have
only considered single-component materials, and their derivations are arguably
more complex than the standard MCT case, which might hinder broader usage. Here
we present a detailed derivation of a distinct active MCT for mixtures of
athermal self-propelled particles that is more transparent than previously
introduced versions. The key insight is that we can follow a similar strategy
for our overdamped active system as is typically used for passive underdamped
MCT. Interestingly, when only considering one particle species, our theory
gives the exact same result as the one obtained in previous work which employed
a highly different mode-coupling strategy. Moreover, we assess the quality of
the theory and its novel extension to multi-component materials by using it to
predict the dynamics of a Kob-Andersen mixture of athermal active Brownian
quasi-hard spheres. We demonstrate that our theory is able to capture all
qualitative features, most notably the location of the optimum of the dynamics
when the persistence length and cage length coincide, for each combination of
particle types.

of deep neural networks in recent years. However, most existing methods suffer
from compromised editing fidelity and limited usability as they either ignore
pose variations (unrealistic editing) or require paired training data (not easy
to collect) for pose controls. This paper presents POCE, an innovative
pose-controllable expression editing network that can generate realistic facial
expressions and head poses simultaneously with just unpaired training images.
POCE achieves the more accessible and realistic pose-controllable expression
editing by mapping face images into UV space, where facial expressions and head
poses can be disentangled and edited separately. POCE has two novel designs.
The first is self-supervised UV completion that allows to complete UV maps
sampled under different head poses, which often suffer from self-occlusions and
missing facial texture. The second is weakly-supervised UV editing that allows
to generate new facial expressions with minimal modification of facial
identity, where the synthesized expression could be controlled by either an
expression label or directly transplanted from a reference UV map via feature
transfer. Extensive experiments show that POCE can learn from unpaired face
images effectively, and the learned model can generate realistic and
high-fidelity facial expressions under various new poses.

main challenges for educators is to achieve learning success while also
creating enthusiasm. As it is particularly difficult to achieve this enthusiasm
initially in young females, prior work has identified gender-specific
differences in the programming behavior of young learners. Since pair
programming, which turns programming into a more sociable activity, has been
proposed as an approach to support programming education, in this paper we aim
to investigate whether similar gender-specific characteristics can also be
observed during pair programming. Therefore, we designed a gender-neutral
introductory SCRATCH programming course tailored for integrating pair
programming principles, and conducted it with a total of 139 students aged
between 8 and 14 years. To identify gender-dependent differences and
similarities, we measure the attitude towards programming and the course
setting, observe the behavior of the students while programming, and analyze
the code of the programs for different gender-combinations. Overall, our study
demonstrates that pair programming is well suited for young learners and
results in a positive attitude. While the resulting programs are similar in
quality and complexity independent of gender, differences are evident when it
comes to the compliance to pair programming roles, the exploration of code, and
the creative customization of programs. These findings contribute to an
in-depth understanding of social and technical gender specifics of pair

the RL agent by providing various types of feedback. However, despite achieving
great empirical successes, HiL RL usually requires too much feedback from a
human teacher and also suffers from insufficient theoretical understanding. In
this paper, we focus on addressing this issue from a theoretical perspective,
aiming to provide provably feedback-efficient algorithmic frameworks that take
human-in-the-loop to specify rewards of given tasks. We provide an
active-learning-based RL algorithm that first explores the environment without
specifying a reward function and then asks a human teacher for only a few
queries about the rewards of a task at some state-action pairs. After that, the
algorithm guarantees to provide a nearly optimal policy for the task with high
probability. We show that, even with the presence of random noise in the
feedback, the algorithm only takes $\widetilde{O}(H{{\dim_{R}^2}})$ queries on
the reward function to provide an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for any $\epsilon >
0$. Here $H$ is the horizon of the RL environment, and $\dim_{R}$ specifies the
complexity of the function class representing the reward function. In contrast,
standard RL algorithms require to query the reward function for at least
$\Omega(\operatorname{poly}(d, 1/\epsilon))$ state-action pairs where $d$
depends on the complexity of the environmental transition.

whether the difficulty of understanding verification results can be reduced.
Method: We perform two different exploratory studies. First, we conduct a user

engineers familiar with formal methods to evaluate whether understanding

Results: The results from the user survey indicate that identifying refinement
inconsistencies, understanding formal notations, and interpreting verification
results are challenging. Nevertheless, engineers are still interested in using
formal methods in real-world development processes because it could reduce the
manual effort for verification. Additionally, they also believe formal methods
could make the system safer. Furthermore, the one-group pretest-posttest

value wherein a new garment is visually worn on a person with a photo-realistic

stage, employing a single-scale warping mechanism and a relatively
unsophisticated content inference mechanism. These approaches have led to
suboptimal results in terms of garment warping and skin reservation under
challenging try-on scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
virtual try-on method via progressive inference paradigm (PGVTON) that
leverages a top-down inference pipeline and a general garment try-on strategy.
Specifically, we propose a robust try-on parsing inference method by
disentangling semantic categories and introducing consistency. Exploiting the
try-on parsing as the shape guidance, we implement the garment try-on via
warping-mapping-composition. To facilitate adaptation to a wide range of try-on
scenarios, we adopt a covering more and selecting one warping strategy and
explicitly distinguish tasks based on alignment. Additionally, we regulate
StyleGAN2 to implement re-naked skin inpainting, conditioned on the target skin
shape and spatial-agnostic skin features. Experiments demonstrate that our
method has state-of-the-art performance under two challenging scenarios. The

integrated assessment models. However, such emissions pathways do not typically
include climate feedbacks on socioeconomic systems and by extension do not
consider climate uncertainty in their construction. We use a well-known
cost-benefit integrated assessment model, the Dynamic Integrated
Climate-Economy (DICE) model, with its climate component replaced by the
Finite-amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model (v2.1). The climate uncertainty
in FaIR is sampled with an ensemble that is consistent with historically
observed climate and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessed
ranges of key climate variables such as equilibrium climate sensitivity. Three
scenarios are produced: a pathway similar to the ""optimal welfare"" scenario of
DICE that has similar warming outcomes to current policies, and pathways that
limit warming to ""well-below"" 2C and 1.5C with low overshoot, in line with
Paris Agreement long-term temperature goals. Climate uncertainty alone is
responsible for a factor of five variation (5-95% range) in the social cost of
carbon in the 1.5C scenario. CO2 emissions trajectories resulting from the
optimal level of emissions abatement in all pathways are also sensitive to
climate uncertainty, with 2050 emissions ranging from -12 to +14 GtCO2/yr in
the 1.5C scenario. Equilibrium climate sensitivity and the strength of
present-day aerosol effective radiative forcing are strong determinants of
social cost of carbon and mid-century CO2 emissions. This shows that narrowing
climate uncertainty leads to more refined estimates for the social cost of
carbon and provides more certainty about the optimal rate of emissions
abatement. Including climate and climate uncertainty in integrated assessment
model derived emissions scenarios would address a key missing feedback in

predicting equivalent sand-grain roughness size $k_s$ based on the roughness
height probability density function and power spectrum leveraging machine
learning as a regression tool, and secondly, extracting information about
relevance of different roughness scales to skin-friction drag by interpreting
the output of the trained data-driven model. The model is an ensemble neural
network consisting of 50 deep neural networks. The data for the training of the
model is obtained from direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of turbulent flow in
plane channels over 85 irregular multi-scale roughness samples at friction
Reynolds number Re$_\tau=800$. The 85 roughness samples are selected from a
repository of 4200 samples, covering a wide parameter space, through an active
learning (AL) framework. The selection is made in several iterations, based on
the informativeness of samples in the repository, quantified by the variance of
ENN predictions. This AL framework aims to maximize the generalizability of the
predictions with a certain amount of data. This is examined using three
different testing data sets with different types of roughness, including 21
surfaces from the literature. The model yields an overall mean error of 5\% to
10\% on different testing data sets. Subsequently, a data interpretation
technique, known as layer-wise relevance propagation, is applied to measure the
contributions of different roughness wave-lengths to the predicted $k_s$.
High-pass filtering is then applied to the roughness PS to exclude the
wave-numbers identified as drag-irrelevant. The filtered rough surfaces are
investigated using DNS, and it is demonstrated that, despite significant impact
of filtering on the roughness topographical appearance and statistics, the
skin-friction coefficient of the original roughness is successfully preserved.

the functional renormalization group by relying on a parametric description of

low-energy observations. Within this approach, a few simplifying approximations
are typically introduced, including the computation of matter renormalization
group equations at 1~loop, an arbitrary definition of the position of the
Planck scale at $10^{19}$ GeV, and an instantaneous decoupling of gravitational
interactions below the Planck scale. In this work we systematically
investigate, both analytically and numerically, the impact of dropping each of
those approximations on the predictions for certain particle physics scenarios.
In particular we study two extensions of the Standard Model, the gauged $B-L$

realistic living cell shapes, the shape representation used by the generative
model should be able to accurately represent fine details and changes in

to represent living cell shapes as level sets of signed distance functions

disentangled from the rotation of the cell shape. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach on cells that exhibit rapid deformations

to algorithmically-generated school catchment areas (""attendance boundaries"")
designed to foster more diverse and integrated schools. Cold email outreach to
approximately 4,320 elected school board members across over 800 school

an interactive dashboard depicting such changes. Board members, however, appear
responsive to different messaging techniques -- particularly those that
dovetail issues of racial and ethnic diversity with other top-of-mind issues
(like school capacity planning). On the other hand, media coverage of the
research drives more dashboard engagement, especially in more segregated

tools to detect LLMs in the wild.
  Unfortunately, most such tools are critically flawed. While major
publications in the LLM detectability field suggested that LLMs were easy to
detect with fine-tuned autoencoders, the limitations of their results are easy
to overlook. Specifically, they assumed publicly available generative models
without fine-tunes or non-trivial prompts. While the importance of these
assumptions has been demonstrated, until now, it remained unclear how well such

  Here, we show that an attacker with access to such detectors' reference human

Achieving it required combining common ""reinforcement from critic"" loss

parenchymal enhancement. In this retrospective study, we developed and
evaluated a transformer-based neural network for breast segmentation (TraBS) in
multi-institutional MRI data, and compared its performance to the well
established convolutional neural network nnUNet. TraBS and nnUNet were trained
and tested on 200 internal and 40 external breast MRI examinations using manual
segmentations generated by experienced human readers. Segmentation performance
was assessed in terms of the Dice score and the average symmetric surface
distance. The Dice score for nnUNet was lower than for TraBS on the internal
testset (0.909$\pm$0.069 versus 0.916$\pm$0.067, P<0.001) and on the external
testset (0.824$\pm$0.144 versus 0.864$\pm$0.081, P=0.004). Moreover, the
average symmetric surface distance was higher (=worse) for nnUNet than for
TraBS on the internal (0.657$\pm$2.856 versus 0.548$\pm$2.195, P=0.001) and on
the external testset (0.727$\pm$0.620 versus 0.584$\pm$0.413, P=0.03). Our
study demonstrates that transformer-based networks improve the quality of
fibroglandular tissue segmentation in breast MRI compared to

the accuracy of breast density and parenchymal enhancement quantification in
breast MRI screening.

placement of a bet. Armed with partial knowledge about a stochastic world, the
organism must decide its next step or near-term strategy, an act that
implicitly or explicitly involves the assumption of a model of the world.
Better information about environmental statistics can improve the bet quality,
but in practice resources for information gathering are always limited. We
argue that theories of optimal inference dictate that ``complex'' models are
harder to infer with bounded information and lead to larger prediction errors.
Thus, we propose a principle of ``playing it safe'' where, given finite
information gathering capacity, biological systems should be biased towards
simpler models of the world, and thereby to less risky betting strategies. In
the framework of Bayesian inference, we show that there is an optimally safe
adaptation strategy determined by the Bayesian prior. We then demonstrate that,
in the context of stochastic phenotypic switching by bacteria, implementation
of our principle of ``playing it safe'' increases fitness (population growth
rate) of the bacterial collective. We suggest that the principle applies
broadly to problems of adaptation, learning and evolution, and illuminates the
types of environments in which organisms are able to thrive.

physics, and to their inherent gauge freedom. To this end, we develop a
framework generalizing the theory of elliptic complexes for sequences of linear

avoids cumbersome fine-tuning of multiple PLMs by only optimizing continuous

conditional replaced token detection all done in a self-guided manner. D2CSE
overloads a single PLM on continuous prompts and greatly saves memory

of the lutetium-nitrogen-hydrogen system remain unknown. By employing the
density functional theory based structure prediction algorithm, we show that in
lutetium-nitrogen-hydrogen the major component is LuH2, together with minor
LuN. The blue LuH2 at ambient pressure will turn into purple and red color at
higher pressures, possibly accompanied by the formation of vacancies at
hydrogen-sites. In LuH2 and LuN, the density of states at the Fermi level is
dominated by the Lu-5d orbitals, while those from hydrogen and nitrogen are
very small, leading to the absence of superconductivity in these two compounds.
Nitrogen-doping to LuH2 fails to enhance the superconductivity as well.

  https://github.com/ruili3/dynamic-multiframe-depth",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-frame depth estimation generally achieves high accuracy relying on the
multi-view geometric consistency. When applied in dynamic scenes, e.g.,
autonomous driving, this consistency is usually violated in the dynamic areas,
leading to corrupted estimations. Many multi-frame methods handle dynamic areas
by identifying them with explicit masks and compensating the multi-view cues
with monocular cues represented as local monocular depth or features. The
improvements are limited due to the uncontrolled quality of the masks and the
underutilized benefits of the fusion of the two types of cues. In this paper,
we propose a novel method to learn to fuse the multi-view and monocular cues
encoded as volumes without needing the heuristically crafted masks. As unveiled
in our analyses, the multi-view cues capture more accurate geometric
information in static areas, and the monocular cues capture more useful
contexts in dynamic areas. To let the geometric perception learned from
multi-view cues in static areas propagate to the monocular representation in
dynamic areas and let monocular cues enhance the representation of multi-view
cost volume, we propose a cross-cue fusion (CCF) module, which includes the
cross-cue attention (CCA) to encode the spatially non-local relative
intra-relations from each source to enhance the representation of the other.
Experiments on real-world datasets prove the significant effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method.

shared global model while retaining their own training data locally.
Nevertheless, the performance of FL is often limited by the slow convergence
due to poor communications links when FL is deployed over wireless networks.
Due to the scarceness of radio resources, it is crucial to select clients
precisely and allocate communication resource accurately for enhancing FL
performance. To address these challenges, in this paper, a joint optimization
problem of client selection and resource allocation is formulated, aiming to
minimize the total time consumption of each round in FL over a non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) enabled wireless network. Specifically, considering the
staleness of the local FL models, we propose an age of update (AoU) based novel
client selection scheme. Subsequently, the closed-form expressions for resource
allocation are derived by monotonicity analysis and dual decomposition method.
In addition, a server-side artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to
predict the FL models of clients who are not selected at each round to further
improve FL performance. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed schemes over FL performance, average AoU
and total time consumption.

typical size and on the implied physical mechanisms. PKS1830-211 is a
remarkable radio-bright lensed quasar with a foreground molecular absorber at
z=0.89. Small-scale morphological changes in the core-jet structure of the
quasar -- which is magnified by the lensing -- result in a varying illumination
of the absorber screen, which in turn causes variations in the absorption
profile. We aim to study the time variations of the system [...] in order to
obtain constraints on both the quasar activity and small-scale structures in
the ISM of the absorber. We used ALMA to monitor the submm continuum emission,
together with the absorption spectra of the H2O and CH molecules, with 17
visits spread over six months in 2016. [...] From the continuum data, we
followed the evolution of the flux density, flux-density ratio, spectral index,
and differential polarization between the two lensed images of the quasar; all
quantities show significant variations related to the intrinsic activity of the
quasar. We propose a simple parametric model of a core plus a ballistic plasmon
to account for the continuum evolution, from which we constrain a time delay of
25+/-3~days between lensed images. The spectral lines reveal significant
variations in the foreground absorption. A PCA highlights apparent wavy time
variations, possibly linked to the helical jet precession period of the quasar.
From the deep averaged spectra towards the SW image, we detect the absorption
of 13CH and estimate an abundance ratio of 12CH/13CH~150. We also measure the
oxygen isotopic ratios, 16O/18O=65.3+/-0.7 and 18O/17O=11.5+/-0.5. Finally, we
find a remarkable continuous shallow trough in the water absorption spanning a
velocity interval of nearly 500 km/s. This broad absorption could be the
signature of an extra-planar molecular component. [Abridged]

charge conjugation symmetry is a priori required to obtain physical results
that are in line with our knowledge of the analytical problem. We also note
that the final numerical results are found to be in excellent agreement with
previous formal analytical (and numerical) evaluations that are limited to a
few simple nuclear distribution models. Our technique can be efficiently
implemented and evaluated in codes that solve the radial Dirac equation in the
finite basis set framework and allows the use of arbitrary (radial) nuclear

effect. This method is hence of special importance for atomic Dirac problems
whose analytical Green's functions expressions are not at hand or have
relatively complicated analytical forms. Furthermore, we propose a vacuum
polarization density formula that forces compliance with charge conjugation
symmetry and can be used in cases where the relativistic basis violates this
symmetry, as is the case in most relativistic basis set programs. In addition,
we have shown that vector components of the vacuum polarization four-current
vanish in the case where the Dirac Hamiltonian is symmetric under time-reversal

of designing a GUI and a crucial task for the success of a software
application. Arranging all components inside a GUI layout manually is a
time-consuming task. In order to assist designers, we developed a method named
GUILGET to automatically generate GUI layouts from positional constraints
represented as GUI arrangement graphs (GUI-AGs). The goal is to support the
initial step of GUI design by producing realistic and diverse GUI layouts. The
existing image layout generation techniques often cannot incorporate GUI design
constraints. Thus, GUILGET needs to adapt existing techniques to generate GUI
layouts that obey to constraints specific to GUI designs. GUILGET is based on
transformers in order to capture the semantic in relationships between elements
from GUI-AG. Moreover, the model learns constraints through the minimization of
losses responsible for placing each component inside its parent layout, for not
letting components overlap if they are inside the same parent, and for
component alignment. Our experiments, which are conducted on the CLAY dataset,
reveal that our model has the best understanding of relationships from GUI-AG
and has the best performances in most of evaluation metrics. Therefore, our
work contributes to improved GUI layout generation by proposing a novel method
that effectively accounts for the constraints on GUI elements and paves the
road for a more efficient GUI design pipeline.

of human experts to generate time constraints. Specifically, PaTeCon
dynamically attaches class restriction to candidate constraints according to
their measuring scores.We evaluate PaTeCon on two large-scale datasets based on

evolves when unitary dynamics is present, both for the case of strongly and
weakly dissipative dynamics. In the strongly dissipative case, the unitary
dynamics can be treated perturbatively and it turns out that the locality of
the Hamiltonian determines how susceptible the spectrum is to such a

well-separated eigenmodes, which we identify to be the local symmetries of the

an exceptional multi-petawatt laser peak power, thus aiming at achieving

$\mathbb{P}(\zeta_s < z \text{ for all } s\leq t ) \sim \mathcal{V}(z)
\varsigma(t) t^{-\theta}$ as $t\to\infty$, for some (explicit)
$\mathcal{V}(\cdot)$, some slowly varying function $\varsigma(\cdot)$ and some
$\theta\in (0,1)$. This extends results in the literature, which mostly focused
on the case of a self-similar process $(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ (such as Brownian
motion or skew-Bessel process) with a homogeneous functional $f$ (namely a pure
power, possibly asymmetric). In a nutshell, we are able to deal with processes
which are only asymptotically self-similar and functionals which are only
asymptotically homogeneous. Our results rely on an excursion decomposition of
$(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$, together with a Wiener--Hopf decomposition of an auxiliary
(bivariate) L\'evy process, with a probabilistic point of view. This provides
an interpretation for the asymptotic behavior of the persistence probabilities,
and in particular for the exponent $\theta$, which we write as $\theta = \rho
\beta$, with $\beta$ the scaling exponent of the local time of $(X_{t})_{t\geq
0}$ at level $0$ and $\rho$ the (asymptotic) positivity parameter of the
auxiliary L\'evy process.

We calculate spatial correlation functions of galaxies, $\xi(r)$, for simulated

earlier results. At low and medium luminosities, bias parameters of galaxies,
$b_0$, are equal, suggesting that dwarf galaxies reside in the same filamentary
web as brighter galaxies. Bias parameters of the lowest luminosity galaxies
estimated from CFs are lower relative to CFs of particle density-limited
clustered samples of DM. We find that bias parameters $b_0$, estimated from CFs
of clustered DM, agree with the expected values from the fraction of particles
in the clustered population, $b=1/F_c$. The cosmic web contains filamentary
structures of various densities, and fractions of matter in the clustered and
the unclustered populations are both less than unity. Thus the CF amplitude of
the clustered matter is always higher than for all matter, i.e. bias parameter
must be $b>1$. Differences between CFs of galaxies and clustered DM suggest
that these functions describe different properties of the cosmic web.

learning to diagnose new diseases once deployed, under the condition of

forgetting of old disease knowledge. To address the catastrophic forgetting
issue, a novel adapter-based strategy is proposed to help effectively learn a
set of new diseases at each round (or task) of continual learning, without
changing the shared feature extractor. The learnable lightweight task-specific
adapter(s) can be flexibly designed (e.g., two convolutional layers) and then
added to the pretrained and fixed feature extractor. Together with a specially
designed task-specific head which absorbs all previously learned old diseases
as a single 'out-of-distribution' category, task-specific adapter(s) can help
the pretrained feature extractor more effectively extract discriminative
features between diseases. In addition, a simple yet effective fine-tuning is
applied to collaboratively fine-tune multiple task-specific heads such that
outputs from different heads are comparable and consequently the appropriate
classifier head can be more accurately selected during model inference.
Extensive empirical evaluations on three image datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method in continual learning of new
diseases. The source code will be released publicly.

Nonetheless, in certain situations, even the random effects approach may

hierarchically structured risk factor to its essence, by grouping similar
categories at each level of the hierarchy. We work top-down and engineer
several features to characterize the profile of the categories at a specific

characterize the risk profile of an industry via its observed damage rates and

patterns of neural activity change along the axis defined by the original

performance, Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) approaches have
been extensively studied. Recently, the single-stage WSSS was awakened to
alleviate problems of the expensive computational costs and the complicated
training procedures in multi-stage WSSS. However, results of such an immature
model suffer from problems of background incompleteness and object
incompleteness. We empirically find that they are caused by the insufficiency
of the global object context and the lack of the local regional contents,
respectively. Under these observations, we propose a single-stage WSSS model
with only the image-level class label supervisions, termed as Weakly Supervised
Feature Coupling Network (WS-FCN), which can capture the multi-scale context
formed from the adjacent feature grids, and encode the fine-grained spatial
information from the low-level features into the high-level ones. Specifically,
a flexible context aggregation module is proposed to capture the global object
context in different granular spaces. Besides, a semantically consistent
feature fusion module is proposed in a bottom-up parameter-learnable fashion to
aggregate the fine-grained local contents. Based on these two modules, WS-FCN
lies in a self-supervised end-to-end training fashion. Extensive experimental
results on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of WS-FCN, which can achieve state-of-the-art
results by 65.02\% and 64.22\% mIoU on PASCAL VOC 2012 val set and test set,
34.12\% mIoU on MS COCO 2014 val set, respectively. The code and weight have

(WD). Its high proper motion and low dispersion measure result in such
significant interstellar scintillation that high signal-to-noise detections
require long observing durations or fortuitous timing. We turn to the sensitive
MeerKAT telescope and, combined with historic Parkes data, leverage PSR
J1933$-$6211's kinematic and relativistic effects to constrain its 3D orbital
geometry and the component masses. We obtain precise proper motion and parallax
estimates, and measure their effects as secular changes in the Keplerian
orbital parameters: a variation in orbital period of $7(1) \times 10^{-13}$ s
s$^{-1}$ and a change in projected semi-major axis of $1.60(5) \times 10^{-14}$
s s$^{-1}$. A self-consistent analysis of all kinematic and relativistic
effects yields a distance of $1.6^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ kpc, an orbital inclination,
$i = 55(1)$ deg and a longitude of the ascending node, $\Omega =
255^{+8}_{-14}$ deg. The probability densities for $\Omega$ and $i$ and their
symmetric counterparts, ($180-i$, $360-\Omega$), are seen to depend on the
fiducial orbit used to measure the time of periastron passage. We investigate
this unexpected dependence and rule out software-related causes using
simulations. Nevertheless, we constrain the pulsar and WD masses to
$1.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ M$_\odot$ and $0.43(5)$ M$_\odot$ respectively. These
strongly disfavour a helium-dominated WD. The orbital similarities between PSRs
J1933$-$6211 and J1614$-$2230 suggest they underwent Case A Roche lobe
overflow, an extended evolution while the companion star is still on the Main
Sequence. However, with a mass of $\sim 1.4$ M$_\odot$, PSR J1933$-$6211 has
not accreted significant matter. This highlights the low accretion efficiency
of the spin-up process and suggests that observed neutron star masses are
mostly a result of supernova physics.

time-reversal symmetry breaking charge order, nematicity, and

on adaptive importance sampling. We consider a smoothed version of the optimal
importance sampling density, which is approximated by an ensemble of
interacting particles. The particle dynamics is governed by a McKean-Vlasov
stochastic differential equation, which was introduced and analyzed in
(Carrillo et al., Stud. Appl. Math. 148:1069-1140, 2022) for consensus-based
sampling and optimization of posterior distributions arising in the context of
Bayesian inverse problems. We develop automatic updates for the internal
parameters of our algorithm. This includes a novel time step size controller
for the exponential Euler method, which discretizes the particle dynamics. The
behavior of all parameter updates depends on easy to interpret accuracy
criteria specified by the user. We show in numerical experiments that our

our logistic regression models, a variant of the Elo method provides a higher
accuracy in terms of explanatory power in the Champions League matches. The

domains to transport on the line. More precisely, sliced optimal transport is
the concatenation of the well-known Radon transform and the cumulative density
transform, which analytically yields the solutions of the reduced transport
problems. Inspired by this concept, we propose two adaptions for optimal
transport on the 2-sphere. Firstly, as counterpart to the Radon transform, we
introduce the vertical slice transform, which integrates along all circles
orthogonal to a given direction. Secondly, we introduce the weighted semicircle
transform, which integrates along all half great circles. Both transforms are
generalized to arbitrary measures on the sphere. While the vertical slice
transform can be combined with optimal transport on the interval and leads to a
sliced Wasserstein distance restricted to even probability measures, the
semicircle transform is related to optimal transport on the circle and results
in a different sliced Wasserstein distance for arbitrary probability measures.
The applicability of both novel sliced optimal transport concepts on the sphere
is demonstrated by proof-of-concept examples dealing with the interpolation and
classification of spherical probability measures. The numerical implementation
relies on the singular value decompositions of both transforms and fast Fourier
techniques. For the inversion with respect to probability measures, we propose
the minimization of an entropy-regularized Kullback--Leibler divergence, which
can be numerically realized using a primal-dual proximal splitting algorithm.

turn is known as Atrophy. For an accurate diagnosis of Alzheimers disease,
cutting edge methods like machine learning are essential. Recently, machine
learning has gained a lot of attention and popularity in the medical industry.
As the illness progresses, those with Alzheimers have a far more difficult time
doing even the most basic tasks, and in the worst case, their brain completely
stops functioning. A persons likelihood of having early-stage Alzheimers
disease may be determined using the ML method. In this analysis, papers on
Alzheimers disease diagnosis based on deep learning techniques and
reinforcement learning between 2008 and 2023 found in google scholar were
studied. Sixty relevant papers obtained after the search was considered for
this study. These papers were analysed based on the biomarkers of AD and the
machine-learning techniques used. The analysis shows that deep learning methods
have an immense ability to extract features and classify AD with good accuracy.
The DRL methods have not been used much in the field of image processing. The

achieve complex multi-step goals, we propose the task of Visual Planning for

""make a shelf"", and a video of the user's progress so far, the aim of VPA is to
obtain a plan, i.e., a sequence of actions such as ""sand shelf"", ""paint shelf"",
etc., to achieve the goal. This requires assessing the user's progress from the
untrimmed video, and relating it to the requirements of underlying goal, i.e.,
relevance of actions and ordering dependencies amongst them. Consequently, this
requires handling long video history, and arbitrarily complex action
dependencies. To address these challenges, we decompose VPA into video action
segmentation and forecasting. We formulate the forecasting step as a
multi-modal sequence modeling problem and present Visual Language Model based
Planner (VLaMP), which leverages pre-trained LMs as the sequence model. We
demonstrate that VLaMP performs significantly better than baselines w.r.t all

software systems. In order to ensure safe and error-free operation, it is
necessary to identify the correct configuration, along with their valid bounds

software systems grow in complexity and scale, the number of configurations and
associated specifications required to ensure the correct operation can become
large and prohibitively difficult to manipulate manually. Due to the fast pace
of software development, it is often the case that correct software
specifications are not thoroughly checked or validated within the software

external sources, including software manuals, code comments, and online

the correct specifications of configurations due to the lack of clarity,
organization, and a centralized unified source to look at. To address this

underneath. It is shown that properly guided magnetic fields can effectively
change mechanical potentials in a way that the energy flow between the
oscillators takes the desired direction. Studies were considered by using a
specific set of descriptive functions characterizing the total excitation
level, its distribution between the pendulums, and the phase shift. The
developed control strategies are based on the observation that, in the case of
antiphase oscillation, the energy is moving from the pendulum subjected to the
repelling magnetic field, to the oscillator under the attracting field. In
contrast, during the inphase oscillations, the energy flow is reversed.
Therefore, closed-loop controller requires only the information about phase
shift, which is easily estimated from dynamic state signals through the
coherency index. Advantage of suggested control strategy is that the temporal
rate of inputs is dictated by the speed of beating, which is relatively slow
compared to the carrying oscillations.

of ambient sensing that can be employed as a contactless means of recognizing
human activity in indoor environments. These methods avoid additional costly
hardware required for vision-based systems, which are privacy-intrusive, by
(re)using Wi-Fi CSI for various safety and security applications. During an
experiment utilizing universal software-defined radio (USRP) to collect CSI
samples, it was observed that a subject engaged in six distinct activities,
which included no activity, standing, sitting, and leaning forward, across
different areas of the room. Additionally, more CSI samples were collected when
the subject walked in two different directions. This study presents a Wi-Fi
CSI-based HAR system that assesses and contrasts deep learning approaches,
namely convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and
hybrid (LSTM+CNN), employed for accurate activity recognition. The experimental
results indicate that LSTM surpasses current models and achieves an average
accuracy of 95.3% in multi-activity classification when compared to CNN and

analytical or closed form solutions. Such problems demand some cutting edge
computational tools with increased functionality and reduced cost. Recently,
deep neural networks have gained massive research interest due to their ability
to handle large data and universality to learn complex functions. In this work,
we put forward a methodology based on deep neural networks with responsive
layers structure to deal nonlinear oscillations in microelectromechanical
systems. We incorporated some oscillatory and non oscillatory activation
functions such as growing cosine unit known as GCU, Sine, Mish and Tanh in our
designed network to have a comprehensive analysis on their performance for
highly nonlinear and vibrational problems. Integrating oscillatory activation
functions with deep neural networks definitely outperform in predicting the
periodic patterns of underlying systems. To support oscillatory actuation for
nonlinear systems, we have proposed a novel oscillatory activation function
called Amplifying Sine Unit denoted as ASU which is more efficient than GCU for
complex vibratory systems such as microelectromechanical systems. Experimental
results show that the designed network with our proposed activation function
ASU is more reliable and robust to handle the challenges posed by nonlinearity
and oscillations. To validate the proposed methodology, outputs of our networks
are being compared with the results from Livermore solver for ordinary
differential equation called LSODA. Further, graphical illustrations of

energetically forbidden in the Minkowski spacetime, but are allowed in the de
Sitter and in SdS backgrounds. In particular, this temperature describes the
probability of ionization of the atom in the SdS, which is observed by the
stationary observer at the point where the shift function (velocity) in the
Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism changes sign. This activation temperature does
not depend on the black hole mass and is fully determined by the Hubble
parameter, $T_{\rm SdS}=\sqrt{3}H/\pi$. This temperature is twice the
Bousso-Hawking temperature $T_{\rm BH}$, which characterizes the limit of
degenerate Lorentzian Schwarzschild-de Sitter universe, when the cosmological

pure de Sitter spacetime, where the corresponding local temperature describing

GPT-4 successfully generates scripts for OT-2, an automated liquid-handling

both biology and robotics, imagine robot actions, and write robotic scripts.

  and Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transforms",,,,,"physics.med-ph cs.MS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  X-Ray based computed tomography (CT) is a well-established technique for
determining the three-dimensional structure of an object from its
two-dimensional projections. In the past few decades, there have been
significant advancements in the brightness and detector technology of
tomography instruments at synchrotron sources. These advancements have led to
the emergence of new observations and discoveries, with improved capabilities
such as faster frame rates, larger fields of view, higher resolution, and
higher dimensionality. These advancements have enabled the material science
community to expand the scope of tomographic measurements towards increasingly
in-situ and in-operando measurements. In these new experiments, samples can be
rapidly evolving, have complex geometries, and restrictions on the field of
view, limiting the number of projections that can be collected. In such cases,
standard filtered back-projections (FBP) for the reconstructions often result
in poor-quality reconstructions. Iterative reconstruction algorithms, such as
model-based iterative reconstructions (MBIR), have demonstrated considerable
success in producing high-quality reconstructions under such restrictions, but
typically require high-performance computing resources with hundreds of compute
nodes to solve the problem in a reasonable time.

vision and has proved useful in different fields such as healthcare, sports

to solve this task, some of them involving sensor data, and some involving
video data. In this paper, we aim to explore two deep learning-based
approaches, namely single frame Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
convolutional Long Short-Term Memory to recognise human actions from videos.
Using a convolutional neural networks-based method is advantageous as CNNs can
extract features automatically and Long Short-Term Memory networks are great
when it comes to working on sequence data such as video. The two models were
trained and evaluated on a benchmark action recognition dataset, UCF50, and
another dataset that was created for the experimentation. Though both models
exhibit good accuracies, the single frame CNN model outperforms the
Convolutional LSTM model by having an accuracy of 99.8% with the UCF50 dataset.

investigated due to their enhanced sensitivity in comparison to standard
systems. In this letter, we report the observation of higher-order
pseudo-Hermitian degeneracies in an electronic platform comprised of three
inductively coupled gain-loss-loss LC resonators. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates that the proposed system can realize third-order EP with
asymmetric coupling between adjacent inductors and an arbitrary scaling factor
between two loss resonators. When capacitive perturbation is introduced on the
middle resonator, the perturbed eigenfrequencies follow a cube-root dependence
on the perturbation parameter; in this case, the sensitivity is significantly
greater than conventional wireless readout methods. Our work enriches the
explorations of higher-order EP on electronic platforms and provides a new
degree of design freedom for the non-Hermitian-EP-enhanced wireless sensing
system.

  The seminar addressed technology-enhanced information access (information
retrieval, recommender systems, natural language processing) and specifically
focused on developing more responsible experimental practices leading to more
valid results, both for research as well as for scientific education.
  The seminar brought together experts from various sub-fields of information
access, namely IR, RS, NLP, information science, and human-computer interaction
to create a joint understanding of the problems and challenges presented by
next generation information access systems, from both the research and the
experimentation point of views, to discuss existing solutions and impediments,
and to propose next steps to be pursued in the area in order to improve not
also our research methods and findings but also the education of the new
generation of researchers and developers.
  The seminar featured a series of long and short talks delivered by
participants, who helped in setting a common ground and in letting emerge
topics of interest to be explored as the main output of the seminar. This led
to the definition of five groups which investigated challenges, opportunities,
and next steps in the following areas: reality check, i.e. conducting
real-world studies, human-machine-collaborative relevance judgment frameworks,
overcoming methodological challenges in information retrieval and recommender
systems through awareness and education, results-blind reviewing, and guidance

conscious super AIs that try to take control over humanity. And as
computational power goes upwards and that turns more and more into a reality,
understanding artificial brains might be increasingly important to control and
drive AI towards the benefit of our societies. This paper proposes a base
framework to aid the development of autonomous multipurpose artificial brains.
To approach that, we propose to first model the functioning of the human brain
by reflecting and taking inspiration from the way the body, the consciousness
and the unconsciousness interact. To do that, we tried to model events such as
sensing, thinking, dreaming and acting, thoughtfully or unconsciously. We
believe valuable insights can already be drawn from the analysis and critique
of the presented framework, and that it might be worth implementing it, with or
without changes, to create, study, understand and control artificially
conscious systems.

  Demand at Low Aggregation Levels",,,,,"q-fin.RM stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the effort to achieve carbon neutrality through a decentralized
electricity market, accurate short-term load forecasting at low aggregation
levels has become increasingly crucial for various market participants'
strategies. Accurate probabilistic forecasts at low aggregation levels can
improve peer-to-peer energy sharing, demand response, and the operation of
reliable distribution networks. However, these applications require not only
probabilistic demand forecasts, which involve quantification of the forecast
uncertainty, but also determining which consumers to include in the aggregation
to meet electricity supply at the forecast lead time. While research papers
have been proposed on the supply side, no similar research has been conducted
on the demand side. This paper presents a method for creating a portfolio that
optimally aggregates demand for a given energy demand, minimizing forecast
inaccuracy of overall low-level aggregation. Using probabilistic load forecasts
produced by either ARMA-GARCH models or kernel density estimation (KDE), we
propose three approaches to creating a portfolio of residential households'
demand: Forecast Validated, Seasonal Residual, and Seasonal Similarity. An
evaluation of probabilistic load forecasts demonstrates that all three
approaches enhance the accuracy of forecasts produced by random portfolios,
with the Seasonal Residual approach for Korea and Ireland outperforming the
others in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.

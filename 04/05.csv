memory-efficiently. The paper demonstrates constructing a
$\texttt{ChoiceDataset}$ from databases of various formats and functionalities
of $\texttt{ChoiceDataset}$. The package implements two widely used models,
namely the multinomial logit and nested logit models, and supports
regularization during model estimation. The package incorporates the option to
take advantage of GPUs for estimation, allowing it to scale to massive datasets
while being computationally efficient. Models can be initialized using either
R-style formula strings or Python dictionaries. We conclude with a comparison
of the computational efficiencies of $\texttt{torch-choice}$ and
$\texttt{mlogit}$ in R as (1) the number of observations increases, (2) the
number of covariates increases, and (3) the expansion of item sets. Finally, we
demonstrate the scalability of $\texttt{torch-choice}$ on large-scale datasets.

Thus, more patients carrying pathogenic germline mutations in various

moderate-risk breast cancer susceptibility genes, ATM and PALB2. Our proposed

examples per class after a pre-training (or meta-training) phase on a set of
base classes. Recent works have shown that simply fine-tuning a pre-trained
Vision Transformer (ViT) on new test classes is a strong approach for FSC.
Fine-tuning ViTs, however, is expensive in time, compute and storage. This has
motivated the design of parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods which
fine-tune only a fraction of the Transformer's parameters. While these methods
have shown promise, inconsistencies in experimental conditions make it
difficult to disentangle their advantage from other experimental factors
including the feature extractor architecture, pre-trained initialization and
fine-tuning algorithm, amongst others. In our paper, we conduct a large-scale,
experimentally consistent, empirical analysis to study PEFTs for few-shot image
classification. Through a battery of over 1.8k controlled experiments on
large-scale few-shot benchmarks including Meta-Dataset (MD) and ORBIT, we
uncover novel insights on PEFTs that cast light on their efficacy in
fine-tuning ViTs for few-shot classification. Through our controlled empirical
study, we have two main findings: (i) Fine-tuning just the LayerNorm parameters
(which we call LN-Tune) during few-shot adaptation is an extremely strong
baseline across ViTs pre-trained with both self-supervised and supervised
objectives, (ii) For self-supervised ViTs, we find that simply learning a set
of scaling parameters for each attention matrix (which we call AttnScale) along
with a domain-residual adapter (DRA) module leads to state-of-the-art
performance (while being $\sim\!$ 9$\times$ more parameter-efficient) on MD.

related KG queries and entities for past KG query workloads, we focus on hybrid
vector similarity search (hybrid queries for short) where part of the query
corresponds to vector similarity search and part of the query corresponds to
predicates over relational attributes associated with the underlying data
vectors. For example, given past KG queries for a song entity, we want to
construct new queries for new song entities whose vector representations are
close to the vector representation of the entity in the past KG query. But
entities in a KG also have non-vector attributes such as a song associated with
an artist, a genre, and a release date. Therefore, suggested entities must also
satisfy query predicates over non-vector attributes beyond a vector-based
similarity predicate. While these tasks are central to KGs, our contributions
are generally applicable to hybrid queries. In contrast to prior works that
optimize online queries, we focus on enabling efficient batch processing of
past hybrid query workloads. We present our system, HQI, for high-throughput
batch processing of hybrid queries. We introduce a workload-aware vector data

upper branch or lower branch of the curve drawn against the wavenumber and
detuning parameter. We then employ a standard linear stability analysis in
order to study the MI dynamics of the continuous waves perturbed by an
infinitesimal perturbation. The main objective of this paper is twofold. We
first investigate the dynamics of the MI gain spectrum at the top and bottom of
the photonic bandgap followed by a comprehensive analysis carried out in the
anomalous and normal dispersion regimes. As a result, this perturbed system
driven by the saturable nonlinearity and gain/loss yields a variety of
instability spectra, which include the conventional side bands, monotonically
increasing gain, the emergence of a single spectrum in either of the Stokes
wavenumber region, and so on. In particular, we observe a remarkably peculiar
spectrum, which is caused predominantly by the system parameter though the
perturbation wavenumber boosts the former. We also address the impact of all

to the development of numerous cost-effective and accessible alternatives that
are created by fine-tuning open-access LLMs with task-specific data (e.g.,
ChatDoctor) or instruction data (e.g., Alpaca). Among the various fine-tuning
methods, adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is undoubtedly
one of the most attractive topics, as it only requires fine-tuning a few
external parameters instead of the entire LLMs while achieving comparable or
even better performance. To enable further research on PEFT methods of LLMs,
this paper presents LLM-Adapters, an easy-to-use framework that integrates
various adapters into LLMs and can execute these adapter-based PEFT methods of
LLMs for different tasks. The framework includes state-of-the-art open-access
LLMs such as LLaMA, BLOOM, OPT, and GPT-J, as well as widely used adapters such
as Series adapter, Parallel adapter, and LoRA. The framework is designed to be
research-friendly, efficient, modular, and extendable, allowing the integration
of new adapters and the evaluation of them with new and larger-scale LLMs.
Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of adapters in LLMs-Adapters, we
conduct experiments on six math reasoning datasets. The results demonstrate
that using adapter-based PEFT in smaller-scale LLMs (7B) with few extra
trainable parameters yields comparable, and in some cases superior, performance
to that of powerful LLMs (175B) in zero-shot inference on simple math reasoning
datasets. Overall, we provide a promising framework for fine-tuning large LLMs
on downstream tasks. We believe the proposed LLMs-Adapters will advance
adapter-based PEFT research, facilitate the deployment of research pipelines,
and enable practical applications to real-world systems.

we performed density functional theory (DFT)+$U$ and dynamical mean field
theory (DMFT) calculations with continuous time quantum Monte Carlo impurity
solver to study the electronic properties of Li$_2$MnO$_3$. Due to the nature
of monoclinic $C2/m$ symmetry, the off-diagonal terms in the $d$-orbital block
Hamiltonian (and $d$-orbital density matrix) are large, which results the large
suppression of the energy gap due to the underestimation of the crystal-field
splitting. We diagonalize the Mn $d$ block in the full $p-d$ Hamiltonian by
applying unitary rotation matrix, and obtained an energy gap of 0.8 eV,
although it is still smaller than the experimental gap of 2.1 eV even with the
large $U$. In the $p$-$d$ model, a small double counting energy is essential to
reduce the $p$-$d$ hybridization, thus to obtain the experimental gap. We show
that the low-energy ($d$-only basis) model is efficient to study the electronic
structure of Li$_2$MnO$_3$, since the Wannier basis is the hybridized state of
Mn $d$ and O $p$ orbitals. These results suggest the correct way to investigate
the low-symmetry materials using DFT+ DMFT method and to our knowledge, there
is no systematic study of the effect of the off-diagonal terms so far. We also
find that the antiferromagnetic ground state $\Gamma_{2u}$ is stable with $U
\leq 2$ within DFT+$U$, which is much smaller than widely used $U$=5 eV.

heterointerfaces of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials. While much research
has focused on intercalating metals and small gas molecules into graphene, the
intercalation of larger molecules through the basal plane of graphene remains
highly unexplored. In this work, we present a new mechanism for intercalating
large molecules through monolayer graphene to form confined oxide materials at
the graphene-substrate heterointerface. We investigate the intercalation of
phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) molecules directly from the vapor phase and confirm
the formation of confined P2O5 at the graphene heterointerface using various
techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) corroborate the experimental
results and reveal the intercalation mechanism, whereby P2O5 dissociates into
small fragments catalyzed by defects in the graphene that then permeates
through lattice defects and reacts at the heterointerface to form P2O5. This
process can also be used to form new confined metal phosphates (e.g., 2D
InPO4). While the focus of this study is on P2O5 intercalation, the possibility
of intercalation from pre-dissociated molecules catalyzed by defects in
graphene may exist for other types of molecules as well. This study is a
significant milestone in advancing our understanding of intercalation routes of
large molecules via the basal plane of graphene, as well as heterointerface
chemical reactions leading to the formation of distinctive confined complex

is that the uniform distribution on proper $q$-colorings on a $\Delta$-regular

that as long as SSM holds on bounded-degree trees with $q$ colors, one would
obtain an efficient sampler for $q$-colorings on all bounded-degree graphs via
simple Markov chain algorithms. It is surprising that such a basic question is
still open, even on trees, but then again it also highlights how much we still
have to learn about random colorings. In this paper, we show the following:
  (1) For any $\Delta \ge 3$, SSM holds for random $q$-colorings on trees of
maximum degree $\Delta$ whenever $q \ge \Delta + 3$. Thus we almost fully
resolve the aforementioned conjecture. Our result substantially improves upon
the previously best bound which requires $q \ge 1.59\Delta+\gamma^*$ for an
absolute constant $\gamma^* > 0$.

optimal mixing of the Glauber dynamics for $q$-colorings on graphs of maximum
degree $\Delta$ and girth $g$ whenever $q \ge \Delta+3$. Our approach is based
on a new general reduction from spectral independence on large-girth graphs to
SSM on trees that is of independent interest.
  Using the same techniques, we also prove near-optimal bounds on weak spatial

human-annotated data to serve as supervision, which is costly to obtain in
dynamic emerging domains. Certain methods seek to address this problem by
solely relying on the surface text of class names to serve as extremely weak
supervision. However, existing methods fail to account for single-class
documents discussing multiple topics. Both topic diversity and vague sentences
may introduce noise into the document's underlying representation and
consequently the precision of the predicted class. Furthermore, current work
focuses on text granularities (documents, sentences, or words) independently,
which limits the degree of coarse- or fine-grained context that we can jointly
extract from all three to identify significant subtext for classification. In
order to address this problem, we propose MEGClass, an extremely
weakly-supervised text classification method to exploit Mutually-Enhancing Text
Granularities. Specifically, MEGClass constructs class-oriented sentence and
class representations based on keywords for performing a sentence-level
confidence-weighted label ensemble in order to estimate a document's initial
class distribution. This serves as the target distribution for a multi-head
attention network with a class-weighted contrastive loss. This network learns
contextualized sentence representations and weights to form document
representations that reflect its original document and sentence-level topic
diversity. Retaining this heterogeneity allows MEGClass to select the most
class-indicative documents to serve as iterative feedback for enhancing the
class representations. Finally, these top documents are used to fine-tune a
pre-trained text classifier. As demonstrated through extensive experiments on
six benchmark datasets, MEGClass outperforms other weakly and extremely weakly
supervised methods.

transition in neutron star (NS) mergers. To this end, we devise a new scheme
approximating thermal effects to supplement any cold, barotropic hybrid
equation of state (EoS) model, i.e. two-phase EoS constructions with a hadronic
regime and a phase of deconfined quark matter. The consideration of
temperature-dependent phase boundaries turns out to be critical for a
quantitative description of quark matter effects in NS mergers, since the
coexistence phase can introduce a strong softening of the EoS at finite
temperature, which is even more significant than the change of the EoS by the
phase transition at T=0. We validate our approach by comparing to existing
fully temperature-dependent EoS models and find a very good quantitative
agreement of postmerger gravitational-wave (GW) features. Simulations with the
commonly-used thermal ideal-gas approach exhibit sizable differences compared
to full hybrid models implying that its use in NS merger simulations with quark
matter is problematic. Our new scheme provides the means to isolate thermal
effects of quark matter from the properties of the cold hybrid EoS and thus
allows an assessment of the thermal behavior alone. We show that different
shapes of the phase boundaries at finite temperature can have a large impact on
the postmerger dynamics and GW signal for the same cold hybrid model. This
finding demonstrates that postmerger GW emission contains important
complementary information compared to properties extracted from cold stars. We
also show by concrete examples that it is even possible for quark matter to
only occur and thus be detectable in finite-temperature systems like merger
remnants but not in cold NSs.

consider the scenario with multi-stage tasks, such as 'pick and place', whose
arrival times are not known a priori. In such a scenario, a coordinating
architecture is expected to be reactive to newly arrived tasks and the
resulting rerouting of agents should be dependent on the stage of completion of
their current multi-stage tasks. In the novel architecture proposed in this
article, a central auctioning system gathers bids (cost-estimates for
completing currently available tasks) from all agents, and solves a
combinatorial problem to optimally assign tasks to agents. For every agent,
it's participation in the auctioning system and execution of an assigned
multi-stage task is managed using behavior trees, which switch among several
well-defined behaviors in response to changing scenarios. The auctioning system
is run at a fixed rate, allowing for newly added tasks to be incorporated into
the auctioning system, which makes the solution reactive and allows for the
rerouting of some agents (subject to the states of the behavior trees). We
demonstrate that the proposed architecture is especially well-suited for
multi-stage tasks, where high costs are incurred when rerouting agents who have
completed one or more stages of their current tasks. The scalability analysis
of the proposed architecture reveals that it scales well with the number of
agents and number of tasks. The proposed framework is experimentally validated
in multiple scenarios in a lab environment. A video of a demonstration can be

the fast time scale. Our main result shows that, if both the reduced order and
the boundary-layer systems are exponentially stable, then the full system is
also exponentially stable for $\varepsilon$ small enough, and our strategy is
based on a spectral analysis of the systems under consideration. Our main

  ultracold atoms",,,,,"cond-mat.quant-gas quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conventional topological insulators exhibit exotic gapless edge or surface
states, as a result of non-trivial bulk topological properties. In
periodically-driven systems the bulk-boundary correspondence is fundamentally
modified and knowledge about conventional bulk topological invariants is
insufficient. While ultracold atoms provide excellent settings for clean
realizations of Floquet protocols, the observation of real-space edge modes has
so far remained elusive. Here we demonstrate an experimental protocol for
realizing chiral edge modes in optical lattices, by creating a topological
interface using a potential step that is generated with a programmable optical
potential. We show how to efficiently prepare particles in these edge modes in
three distinct Floquet topological regimes that are realized in a
periodically-driven honeycomb lattice. Controlling the height and sharpness of
the potential step, we study how edge modes emerge at the interface and how the
group velocity of the particles is modified as the sharpness of the potential
step is varied.

$B^-\to\pi^-\mu^+\mu^-$ decays. The analysis uses a sample of beauty mesons
produced in proton-proton collisions collected with the LHCb detector between
2011 and 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9 fb$^{-1}$. The
signal signature corresponds to simultaneous peaks in the $\mu^+\mu^-$ and
$\pi^-\mu^+\mu^-$ invariant masses. No evidence for an excess of events over
background is observed and an upper limit is set on the branching fraction of
the decay at ${\cal B}(D^{*}(2007)^0\to\mu^+\mu^-) < 2.6\times 10^{-8}$ at
$90\%$ confidence level. This is the first limit on the branching fraction of
$D^{*}(2007)^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decays and the most stringent limit on
$D^{*}(2007)^0$ decays to leptonic final states. The analysis is the first
search for a rare charm-meson decay exploiting production via beauty decays.

allow token-level interactions between queries and documents, and hence achieve
state of the art on many information retrieval benchmarks. However, their
non-linear scoring function cannot be scaled to millions of documents,
necessitating a three-stage process for inference: retrieving initial
candidates via token retrieval, accessing all token vectors, and scoring the
initial candidate documents. The non-linear scoring function is applied over
all token vectors of each candidate document, making the inference process
complicated and slow. In this paper, we aim to simplify the multi-vector
retrieval by rethinking the role of token retrieval. We present XTR,
ConteXtualized Token Retriever, which introduces a simple, yet novel, objective
function that encourages the model to retrieve the most important document
tokens first. The improvement to token retrieval allows XTR to rank candidates
only using the retrieved tokens rather than all tokens in the document, and
enables a newly designed scoring stage that is two-to-three orders of magnitude
cheaper than that of ColBERT. On the popular BEIR benchmark, XTR advances the
state-of-the-art by 2.8 nDCG@10 without any distillation. Detailed analysis
confirms our decision to revisit the token retrieval stage, as XTR demonstrates
much better recall of the token retrieval stage compared to ColBERT.

described by exponentially localized wave-functions. Here we establish a
relationship between these two seemingly unrelated observations. The connection
is explicit in the low-lying states of the spectral localizer of trivial
metals, an operator that measures the obstruction to finding localized
eigenstates. The low-lying spectrum of the spectral localizer of metals is
determined by the zero-mode solutions of Dirac fermions with a varying mass
parameter. We use this observation, valid in any dimension, to determine the
difference between the localizer spectrum of trivial and topological metals,
and conjecture the spectrum of the localizer for fractional quantum Hall edges.
Because the localizer is a local real-space operator, it may be used as a tool
to differentiate between non-crystalline topological and trivial metals, and to

geometric features of an ensemble of point clouds. At the core of our approach
is the point of view that the data arises as sampled recordings from a metric
space-valued stochastic process, possibly of nonstationary nature, thereby
integrating geometric data analysis into the realm of functional time series
analysis. We focus on the descriptors coming from topological data analysis.
Our framework allows for natural incorporation of spatial-temporal dynamics,
heterogeneous sampling, and the study of convergence rates. Further, we derive
complete invariants for classes of metric space-valued stochastic processes in
the spirit of Gromov, and relate these invariants to so-called ball volume
processes. Under mild dependence conditions, a weak invariance principle in
$D([0,1]\times [0,\mathscr{R}])$ is established for sequential empirical
versions of the latter, assuming the probabilistic structure possibly changes
over time. Finally, we use this result to introduce novel test statistics for
topological change, which are distribution free in the limit under the
hypothesis of stationarity.

these two platforms differ from aerial work robots: UAVs are limited in their
payload capacity, while cars are restricted to two-dimensional movements. To
fill this gap, we create the Giraffe mapping robot based on a bucket truck,
which is equipped with a variety of well-calibrated and synchronized sensors:
four 3D LiDARs, two stereo cameras, two monocular cameras, Inertial Measurement

millimeter-level ground truth positions. We also make its ground twin, the
Okapi mapping robot, to gather data for comparison. The proposed dataset
extends the typical autonomous driving sensing suite to aerial scenes.
Therefore, the dataset is named FLICAR to denote flying cars. We believe this

model of the robot's kinematics together with proprioceptive sensors to
maintain the pose estimate during visual-inertial odometry (VIO) failures.
Furthermore, the trajectories from successful VIO and the ones from the
model-driven odometry are integrated in a coherent set that maintains a
consistent pose at all times. Health-monitoring tracks the VIO process ensuring
timely switches between the two estimators. Finally, loop closure is
implemented on the overall trajectory. The resulting framework is a robust
estimator switching between model-based and visual-inertial odometry (SM/VIO).

Though progress has been achieved, the DTW-based ECG classification also brings

shows that the ECG input samples' labels can be stolen via a side-channel
attack, Flush+Reload. In particular, we first identify the vulnerability of DTW
for ECG classification, i.e., the correlation between warping path choice and
prediction results. Then we implement an attack that leverages Flush+Reload to
monitor the warping path selection with known ECG data and then build a

mixture of spectroscopic and photometry observations, hence do not fully
capture all the important dust features nor continuum variations. Using four
existing samples of spectroscopically measured dust extinction curves, we
consistently measure the R(V) dependent extinction relationship
spectroscopically from the far-ultraviolet to mid-infrared for the first time.
Linear fits of A(lambda)/A(V) dependent on R(V) are done using a method that
fully accounts for their significant and correlated uncertainties. These linear
parameters are fit with analytic wavelength dependent functions to determine
the smooth R(V) (2.3-5.6) and wavelength (912 A-32 micron) dependent extinction
relationship. This relationship shows that the far-UV rise, 2175 A bump, and
the three broad optical features are dependent on R(V), but the 10 and 20
micron features are not. Existing literature relationships show significant
deviations compared to this relationship especially in the far-ultraviolet and
infrared. Extinction curves that clearly deviate from this relationship
illustrate that this relationship only describes the average behavior versus
R(V). We find tentative evidence that the relationship may not be linear with
1/R(V) especially in the ultraviolet. For the first time, this relationship
provides measurements of dust extinction that spectroscopically resolve the
continuum and features in the ultraviolet, optical, and infrared as a function

necessitates a description of spacetime geometry in terms of above bi-tensors,
and naturally replaces the conventional description based on the metric tensor
$g_{ab}(x)$ with a description in terms of a non-local bi-tensor $q_{ab}(x,

tuning on top of that required to account for observations at scales probed by

propose to graft a deformation network into the NeRF to further model the

such pipelines either rely on pose-dependent representations or fall short of
motion coherency due to frame-independent optimization, making it difficult to
generalize to unseen pose sequences realistically. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework MonoHuman, which robustly renders view-consistent and
high-fidelity avatars under arbitrary novel poses. Our key insight is to model
the deformation field with bi-directional constraints and explicitly leverage
the off-the-peg keyframe information to reason the feature correlations for
coherent results. Specifically, we first propose a Shared Bidirectional
Deformation module, which creates a pose-independent generalizable deformation
field by disentangling backward and forward deformation correspondences into
shared skeletal motion weight and separate non-rigid motions. Then, we devise a
Forward Correspondence Search module, which queries the correspondence feature
of keyframes to guide the rendering network. The rendered results are thus
multi-view consistent with high fidelity, even under challenging novel pose
settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed
MonoHuman over state-of-the-art methods.

bounds on bulk Wilson coefficients. Our bounds are on the Wilson coefficients
themselves, rather than their ratios, as is typically found in the literature.
Inspired by the Celestial amplitudes program in flat space, we perform a
Celestial transform of the CFT Mellin amplitude of four identical scalars.
Using the crossing symmetric dispersion relation (CSDR), we express the
resulting amplitude in terms of crossing symmetric conformal partial waves. The
partial waves satisy remarkable positivity properties which along with the
unitarity of the CFT prove sufficient to derive the bounds. We then employ our
methods in the limit of large AdS radius and recover known bounds on flat space
Wilson coefficients and new bounds on their large radius corrections. We check
that the planar Mellin amplitude of four stress-tensor multiplets in
$\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM satisfies our bounds. Finally, using null constraints, we
derive a form of low-spin dominance in AdS EFTs. We find that the low-spin
dominance is strongest in flat space and weakens as we move away from flat
space towards higher AdS curvature.

classifier that outputs a joint distribution $p(\mathbf{x},y)$, enabling an
image generator in its backward pass by marginalizing out the label $y$. This
is done by estimating the energy and classification probability given a noisy

  To fill this gap, this paper proposes FuzzGPT, the first technique to prime
LLMs to synthesize unusual programs for fuzzing. FuzzGPT is built on the
well-known hypothesis that historical bug-triggering programs may include

non-vanishing hadronic couplings, it can also be produced via the
bremsstrahlung of the incident proton beam. The subsequent decay of the
mediator to a tau neutrino pair results in tau neutrino detection at the near
detectors, which is unexpected under the standard three-flavor neutrino
oscillation paradigm. We argue that the signal flux from the charged meson
decays can be significant enough to discover the light mediator signal at the
on-axis liquid-argon near detector of the DUNE experiment, due to the focusing
of charged mesons. In addition, we show that ICARUS-NuMI, an off-axis near
detector of the NuMI beam, as well as DUNE, can observe a handful of tau
neutrino events induced by beam-proton bremsstrahlung.

galactic astrophysics, as well as the dark matter population in the Milky Way.
On the other hand, performing a detailed, high-fidelity statistical analysis of
these objects is challenging for a number of key reasons. Firstly, the
modelling of streams across their (potentially billions of years old) dynamical
age is complex and computationally costly. Secondly, their detection and
classification in large surveys such as Gaia renders a robust statistical
description regarding e.g., the stellar membership probabilities, challenging.
As a result, the majority of current analyses must resort to simplified models
that use only subsets or summaries of the high quality data. In this work, we
develop a new analysis framework that takes advantage of advances in
simulation-based inference techniques to perform complete analysis on complex
stream models. To facilitate this, we develop a new, modular dynamical
modelling code sstrax for stellar streams that is highly accelerated using jax.
We test our analysis pipeline on a mock observation that resembles the GD1
stream, and demonstrate that we can perform robust inference on all relevant
parts of the stream model simultaneously. Finally, we present some outlook as
to how this approach can be developed further to perform more complete and
accurate statistical analyses of current and future data.

Pipe3D data products were used to construct various fundamental galaxy scaling
relations that are also compared uniformly with similar relations from NIHAO
zoom-in simulations. Simulated NIHAO galaxies were found to broadly reproduce
the observed MaNGA galaxy population for $\log (M_*/{\rm M_{\odot}) > 8.5}$.
Some discrepancies remain, such as those pertaining to central stellar
densities and the diversity of RCs due to strong feedback schemes. Also
presented are spatially-resolved scatters for the velocity-size-stellar mass
(VRM$_*$) structural relations using MaNGA and NIHAO samples. The scatter for
these relations in the galaxian interiors is a consequence of the diversity of
inner RC shapes, while scatter in the outskirts is dictated by the large range
of stellar surface densities which itself is driven by sporadic star formation.
The detailed spatially-resolved scatter analysis highlights the complex
interplay between local and global astrophysical processes and provides a
strong constraint to numerical simulations.

represent an exciting step forward in terms of detector sensitivity and
performance. For example, key upgrades at the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA facilities
will see the next observing run (O4) probe a spatial volume around four times
larger than the previous run (O3), and design implementations for e.g. the
Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer and LISA experiments are taking shape to
explore a wider frequency range and probe cosmic distances. In this context,
however, a number of very real data analysis problems face the gravitational

to analyse (amongst other scenarios) signals that arrive coincidentally in
detectors, longer signals that are in the presence of non-stationary noise or
other shorter transients, as well as noisy, potentially correlated, coherent
stochastic backgrounds. With these challenges in mind, we develop peregrine, a
new sequential simulation-based inference approach designed to study broad
classes of gravitational wave signal. In this work, we describe the method and
implementation, before demonstrating its accuracy and robustness through direct
comparison with established likelihood-based methods. Specifically, we show
that we are able to fully reconstruct the posterior distributions for every
parameter of a spinning, precessing compact binary coalescence using one of the
most physically detailed and computationally expensive waveform approximants
(SEOBNRv4PHM). Crucially, we are able to do this using only 2\% of the waveform
evaluations that are required in e.g. nested sampling approaches. Finally, we
provide some outlook as to how this level of simulation efficiency and
flexibility in the statistical analysis could allow peregrine to tackle these

optically-selected AGN at $0.44<z<0.64$ reside in statistically identical halos
with a typical dark matter halo mass of $M_{\rm DMH}^{\rm typ,AGN} \sim
10^{12.7}\,h^{-1}\,\rm{M}_\odot$. The acceptable HOD parameter space for these
two broad-line AGN samples have only statistically marginal differences caused
by small deviations of the CCFs in the 1-halo dominated regime on small scales.
In contrast to optically-selected AGN, the X-ray AGN sample may contain a
larger population of satellites at $M_{\rm DMH} \sim

our earlier studies at lower independent redshift ranges, spanning a look-back

reveals: (i) no significant difference between the typical DMH masses of X-ray

with the VLA at $21^{\prime\prime}$ angular resolution ($\approx500$ pc) of an
extended ($\sim$1.5 deg$^2$) 10-point mosaic combined with GBT single dish
data. We study the super-extended HI disk of M83 (${\sim}$50 kpc in radius), in
particular disc kinematics, rotation and the turbulent nature of the atomic
interstellar medium. We define distinct regions in the outer disk ($r_{\rm
gal}>$central optical disk), including ring, southern area, and southern and
northern arm. We examine HI gas surface density, velocity dispersion and
non-circular motions in the outskirts, which we compare to the inner optical
disk. We find an increase of velocity dispersion ($\sigma_v$) towards the
pronounced HI ring, indicative of more turbulent HI gas. Additionally, we
report over a large galactocentric radius range (until $r_{\rm gal}{\sim}$50
kpc) that $\sigma_v$ is slightly larger than thermal (i.e. $>8$km s$^{-1}$ ).
We find that a higher star formation rate (as traced by FUV emission) is not
always necessarily associated with a higher HI velocity dispersion, suggesting
that radial transport could be a dominant driver for the enhanced velocity
dispersion. We further find a possible branch that connects the extended HI
disk to the dwarf irregular galaxy UGCA365, that deviates from the general
direction of the northern arm. Lastly, we compare mass flow rate profiles
(based on 2D and 3D tilted ring models) and find evidence for outflowing gas at
r$_{\rm gal}$ $\sim$2 kpc, inflowing gas at r$_{\rm gal}$ $\sim$5.5 kpc and
outflowing gas at r$_{\rm gal}$ $\sim$14 kpc. We caution that mass flow rates
are highly sensitive to the assumed kinematic disk parameters, in particular,
to the inclination.

performed with the radiative transfer code Aton and can recover the simulated
parameters within $1\sigma$ uncertainty. We measure the three parameters by
forward-modeling the Ly$\alpha$ forest and comparing the effective optical
depth ($\tau_{\rm eff, HI}$) distribution in simulations and observations. The
final uncertainties in our measured parameters account for the uncertainties
due to thermal parameters, modeling parameters, observational systematics and
cosmic variance. Our best fit parameters show significant evolution with
redshift such that $\lambda_{\rm mfp,HI}$ and $\langle f_{\rm HI} \rangle$
decreases and increases by a factor $\sim 6$ and $\sim 10^{4}$, respectively

Utilising these glass-like catalogues, we assess the bias and variance of the
Landy-Szalay (LS) estimator of the first three two-point correlation function
(2PCF) multipoles in halo and particle catalogues created with the cosmological
N-body code gevolution. Our results demonstrate that the LS estimator
calculated with the glass catalogues is biased by less than $10^{-4}$ with
respect to the estimate derived from Poisson-sampled random catalogues, for all
multipoles considered and on all but the smallest scales. Additionally, the
estimates derived from glass-like catalogues exhibit significantly smaller
standard deviation $\sigma$ than estimates based on commonly used
Poisson-sampled random catalogues of comparable size. The standard deviation of
the estimate depends on a power of the number of objects $N_R$ in the random
catalogue; we find a power law $\sigma \propto N_R^{-0.9}$ for glass-like
random catalogues as opposed to $\sigma \propto N_R^{-0.48}$ using
Poisson-sampled random catalogues. Given a required precision, this allows for
a much reduced number of objects in the glass-like random catalogues used for
the LS estimate of the 2PCF multipoles, significantly reducing the
computational costs of each estimate.

SUPERCOLD-CGM survey is the first statistical survey of cold molecular gas on
CGM scales. We present ALMA+ACA observations of CO(4-3) and continuum emission
from 10 Enormous Ly$\alpha$ Nebula (ELANe) around ultraluminous type-I QSOs at
$z\sim2$. We detect CO(4-3) in 100$\%$ of our targets, with 60$\%$ showing
extended CO on scales of 15$-$100 kpc. Q1228+3128 reveals the most extended
CO(4-3) reservoir of $\sim$100 kpc and is the only radio-loud target in our
sample. The CO reservoir is located along the radio axis, which could indicate
a link between the inner radio-jet and cold halo gas. For the other five
radio-quiet ELANe, four of them show extended CO(4-3) predominantly in the
direction of their companions. These extended CO(4-3) reservoirs identify
enrichment of the CGM, and may potentially contribute to widespread star
formation. However, there is no evidence from CO(4-3) for diffuse molecular gas
spread across the full extent of the Ly$\alpha$ nebulae. One target in our
sample (Q0107) shows significant evidence for a massive CO disk associated with
the QSO. Moreover, 70$\%$ of our QSO fields contain at least one CO companion,
two of which reveal extended CO emission outside the ELANe. Our results provide
insight into roles of both the cold CGM and companions in driving the early
evolution of massive galaxies.

neutral $D$ mesons in the Belle II experiment. The algorithm exploits the
correlation between the flavor of a reconstructed neutral $D$ meson (signal $D$
meson) and the electric charges of particles reconstructed in the rest of the
$e^+e^-\to c \bar{c}$ event. These include those originating from the decay of
the other charm hadron produced in the event, as well as those possibly
produced in association with the signal $D$ meson. We develop the algorithm
using simulation and calibrate it in data using decay modes that identify the
flavor of the decaying neutral $D$ meson. We use a data sample of $e^+e^-$
collisions, corresponding to $362\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity,
collected by Belle II at center-of-mass energies near the $\Upsilon(4S)$ mass.
The effective tagging efficiency in data is $(47.91 \pm 0.07 \mathrm{(stat)}
\pm 0.51 \mathrm{(syst)})\%$, independent of the neutral-$D$-meson decay mode.
This charm flavor tagger will approximately double the effective sample size of
many $CP$-violation and charm-mixing measurements that so far have exclusively
relied on neutral $D$ mesons originating from $D^{*\pm}$ decays. While
developed for Belle II, the basic principles underlying the charm flavor tagger
can be used in other experiments, including those at hadron colliders.

Lorentzian polynomials, covolume polynomials have M-convex support and

  We observe that Chern classes of globally generated bundles give rise to
covolume polynomials, and use this fact to prove that certain polynomials
associated with Segre classes of subschemes of products of projective spaces
are covolume polynomials. We conjecture that the same polynomials may be
Lorentzian after a standard normalization operation.
  Finally, we obtain a combinatorial application of a particular case of our
Segre class result. We prove that the adjoint polynomial of a convex polyhedral

can drift over large distances to support planet growth in the inner disc. In
the past decade, this pebble accretion has been studied extensively for
aerodynamically small pebbles (Stokes number St < 1). However, accretion can
also operate in the St > 1 mode, e.g., when planetesimals collisionally
fragment to smaller bodies or when the primordial gas disc disperses. This work
aims to extend the study of pebble accretion to these aerodynamically loosely
coupled particles. We integrate the pebble's equation of motion, accounting for
gas drag, stellar and planetary gravity, in the midplane of a laminar disc. The
accretion probability ($\epsilon$) is calculated as function of Stokes number,
disc pressure gradient index, planet mass and eccentricity. We find that for
Stokes number above unity $\epsilon$(St) first rises, due to lower drift and
aided by a large atmospheric capture radius, until it reaches a plateau where
the efficiency approaches 100 per cent. At high St the plateau region
terminates as particles become trapped in resonance. These results are well
described by a semi-analytical ""kick-and-drift"" model and we also provide fully
analytical prescriptions for $\epsilon$. We apply our model to the accretion of
$\sim 30 \mu$m dust particles in a dispersing protoplanetary and secondary
(CO-rich) debris disc. It shows that physically small particles are mainly
accreted as aerodynamically large Stokes number pebbles during the debris disc
phase. Earth-mass planets may obtain $\sim 25$ per cent of their heavy elements
through this late accretion phase.

  planetesimal transport","18 pages, 11 figures",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The formation of a cold Jupiter (CJ) is expected to quench the influx of
pebbles and the migration of cores interior to its orbit, thus limiting the
efficiency of rocky planet formation either by pebble accretion and/or orbital
migration. Observations, however, show that the presence of outer CJs ( >1 au
and >0.3 Jupiter masses) correlates with the presence of inner Super Earths (at
<1 au). This observation may simply be a result of an enhanced initial
reservoir of solids in the nebula required to form a CJ or a
yet-to-be-determined mechanism assisted by the presence of the CJ. In this
work, we focus on the latter alternative and study the orbital transport of
planetesimals interior to a CJ subject to the gravity and drag from a
viscously-evolving gaseous disk. We find that a secular resonance sweeping
inwards through the disk gradually transports rings of planetesimals when their
drag-assisted orbital decay is faster than the speed of the resonance scanning.
This snowplow-like process leads to large concentration (boosted by a factor of
~10-100) of size-segregated planetesimal rings with aligned apsidal lines,
making their expected collisions less destructive due to their reduced velocity
dispersion. This process is efficient for a wide range of alpha-disk models and
Jovian masses, peaking for ~1-5 Jupiter masses, typical of observed CJs in
radial velocity surveys. Overall, our work highlights the major role that the
disk's gravity may have on the orbital redistribution of planetesimals,
depicting a novel avenue by which CJs may enhance the formation of inner
planetary systems, including super-Earths and perhaps even warm and hot
Jupiters.

obtained during the 2013 reflaring period, and only optical detections were
acquired in 2014. During the reflaring in both 2013 and 2014, the source showed
bluer-when-brighter behavior, having optical colors consistent with a blackbody
heating and cooling between 4500 and 9500 K, i.e. the temperature range in
which hydrogen starts to ionize. Finally, we compare the flaring behavior of
the source to re-brightening events in other X-ray binaries. We show that the

the field, the DDI induces an asymmetry in the emission spectra as a function
of pump field detuning. At positive detuning, the single-photon blockade gets
stronger as a function of DDI strength, leading to photon antibunching.
However, it becomes weaker at negative detuning and can also completely vanish.
We show that this vanishing single-photon blockade is associated with a strong
two-photon blockade, leading to two-photon bunching. Therefore, by just tuning
the frequency of the pump field, we can achieve two very distinct features. We
also study the effects of DDI when the atoms are asymmetrically coupled with

in this continuous space subject to highly parameterized physical models.
However, these techniques impose a trade-off in adaptability and data

misinterpretation of the measured travel times in local helioseismology,
complicating inferences of, e.g., the deep meridional flow. In this study, we
carry out phase-shift computations using a simulated, fully radiative, and
convective atmosphere from which the \ion{Fe}{1} 6173.3\,\AA\ line is
synthesized. The resulting phase-shifts as functions of frequency across
multiple heights show non-zero values in evanescent waves, similar to what was
found in observational data. Comparing the Doppler-velocities estimated from
the synthesized absorption line with the true velocities directly obtained from
the simulated plasma motions, we find substantial differences in phase-shifts
between the two. This leads us to hypothesize that the non-adiabaticity of the
solar atmosphere yields extra phase-shift contributions to Doppler velocities.
Finally, computing phase-differences for different viewing angles reveals a
systematic center-to-limb variation, similar to what is present in
observations. Overall, this study helps to improve our understanding of the

Verifying safety of these systems, however, is computationally challenging due

possible faults and attacks that can be incurred by the subsystems
interconnected within the network. In this paper, we develop a compositional
resilience index to verify safety properties of interconnected systems under
faults and attacks. The resilience index is a tuple serving the following two
purposes. First, it quantifies how a safety property is impacted when a
subsystem is compromised by faults and attacks. Second, the resilience index
characterizes the needed behavior of a subsystem during normal operations to
ensure safety violations will not occur when future adverse events occur. We
develop a set of sufficient conditions on the dynamics of each subsystem to
satisfy its safety constraint, and leverage these conditions to formulate an
optimization program to compute the resilience index. When multiple subsystems
are interconnected and their resilience indices are given, we show that the
safety constraints of the interconnected system can be efficiently verified by
solving a system of linear inequalities. We demonstrate our developed

traces outflow mass, with a conical shape and a maximum opening angle near 90
deg. However, outflow cavities with paraboloidal shape and wider angles are
more consistent with observed estimates of the SFE. This paper presents a model
of infall and outflow evolution based on these properties. The initial state is
a truncated singular isothermal sphere which has mass $\approx$1 $M_\odot$,
free fall time $\approx$80 kyr, and small fractions of magnetic, rotational,
and turbulent energy. The core collapses pressure-free as its protostar and
disk launch a paraboloidal wide-angle wind. The cavity walls expand radially
and entrain envelope gas into the outflow. The model matches SFE values when
the outflow mass increases faster than the protostar mass by a factor 1 - 2,
yielding protostar masses typical of the IMF. It matches observed outflow
angles if the outflow mass increases at nearly the same rate as the cavity
volume. The predicted outflow angles are then typically $\sim$50 deg as they
increase rapidly through the stage 0 duration of $\sim$40 kyr. They increase
more slowly up to $\sim$110 deg during their stage I duration of $\sim$70 kyr.
With these outflow rates and shapes, model predictions appear consistent with

decompose the continual motion synthesis problem into walking along paths and
transitioning in and out of the actions specified by the keypoints, which
enables long generation of motions that satisfy scene constraints without
explicitly incorporating scene information. Our method is trained only using
scene agnostic mocap data. As a result, our approach is deployable across 3D
scenes with various geometries. For achieving plausible continual motion
synthesis without drift, our key contribution is to generate motion in a
goal-centric canonical coordinate frame where the next immediate target is
situated at the origin. Our model can generate long sequences of diverse
actions such as grabbing, sitting and leaning chained together in arbitrary

a collection $\mathcal{S}$ of $m$ sets over a universe $\mathcal{U}$ of size

$n$ elements one-by-one from $D$ and must buy a set to cover each element on

times from distribution $D$, then the algorithm commits to outputting $S(U)$.
Grandoni et al. gave an $O(\log mN)$-competitive universal algorithm for this

  We improve unilaterally upon this result by giving a simple, polynomial time
$O(\log mn)$-competitive universal algorithm for the more general prophet
version, in which $U$ is formed by drawing from $n$ different distributions
$D_1, \ldots, D_n$. Furthermore, we show that we do not need full foreknowledge

We show similar results for the 2-stage prophet setting and for the
online-with-a-sample setting.
  We obtain our results via a generic reduction from the single-sample prophet
setting to the random-order setting; this reduction holds for a broad class of
minimization problems that includes all covering problems. We take advantage of
this framework by giving random-order algorithms for non-metric facility
location and set multicover; using our framework, these automatically translate
to universal prophet algorithms.

major merger of two massive galaxies at redshift $z \sim 8$ results in the
formation of a nuclear supermassive disk (SMD) of only $4$ pc in radius, owing
to a prodigious gas inflow sustained at $100$-$1000$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The
core of the merger remnant is metal-rich, well above solar abundance, and the
SMD reaches a gaseous mass of $3 \times 10^8$ $M_{\odot}$ in less than a
million years after the merger, despite a concurrent prominent nuclear
starburst. Dynamical heating as gas falls into the deepest part of the
potential well, and heating and stirring by supernova blastwaves, generate a
turbulent multi-phase interstellar medium, with a gas velocity dispersion
exceeding 100 km s$^{-1}$. As a result, only moderate fragmentation occurs in
the inner $10$-$20$ pc despite the temperature falls below $1000$ K. The SMD is
Jeans-unstable as well as bar-unstable and will collapse further adiabatically,
becoming warm and ionized. We show that the SMD, following inevitable
contraction, will become general relativistic unstable and directly form a
supermassive BH of mass in the range $10^6$-$10^8$ $M_{\odot}$, essentially
skipping the stage of BH seed formation. These results confirm that mergers

to explain the experimentally-measured blackbody spectrum. In order to get this
result, Planck proposed his radiation law in a two-fold way: 1) by an
\textit{ad hoc} modification of the assumed connection between energy and
entropy for thermal radiation; 2) by assuming that the calculation of the
entropy of an oscillator in thermal equilibrium with radiation is carried out
by discrete units of energy. As a consequence, the energy quantization, linear
in frequency, was thus introduced into physics. However, the energy
quantization of the simple harmonic oscillator was originally postulated by
Planck in an incomplete way, i.e., the ground state energy was not assumed to
be null. Of course, this issue has been solved in different ways over time.
Despite of this, we propose an alternative way to fix this issue by describing
harmonic oscillators at noncommutative(NC) framework, where the non-null ground

a higher amount wins the corresponding battlefield value. At the beginning of
the game, the budgets of the agents and the values of the battlefields are
specified. In the first stage, the players are allowed to perform a battlefield
transfer in which one player offloads a number of its battlefields onto the
other player. In the second stage, the adversary observes this transfer and
determines how to allocate their budget accordingly. Finally, in the third
stage, the players and the adversary allocate their budgets to their
battlefields, the game is played, and their payoffs are realized. We provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a battlefield transfer
that strictly increases the payoff of each player. We then augment the model,
allowing players to not only transfer subsets of battlefields, but also

influence of anisotropy on wavefronts, it is essential to have a solid grasp of
the underlying physics. Unfortunately, the anisotropy model that best describes
the medium is often unknown. To address this issue, we utilize paraxial-ray
theory in a ray-centered coordinate system to study the wavefront phenomenon.
This approach allows us to develop explicit expressions that describe the
physics of the problem. Using this theoretical framework, we can accurately
generalize the relationship between time-migration rays and Dix velocity by
incorporating the velocity-spreading factor for general anisotropic media. This
factor lets us determine the type of anisotropy present in the medium.
Moreover, the velocity-spreading factor provides valuable information for
various applications, including model building, time-imaging, and time-to-depth
conversion. Overall, the presented theoretical framework offers a comprehensive
understanding of wavefront propagation in anisotropic media, which can aid in
improving the knowledge of the phenomena that form seismic images.

demonstrate that a controlled THz nonlinearity - tuned from monolayer to bulk

generation of ultrafast photocurrents and the engineering of the bandstructure
valleys. This is combined with the PtSe2 layer interaction with the substrate
for a broken material centro-symmetry permitting a second order nonlinearity.
Further, we show layer-dependent circular dichroism, where the sign of the
ultrafast currents and hence the phase of the emitted THz pulse can be
controlled through the excitation of different bandstructure valleys. In
particular, we show that a semimetal has a strong dichroism that is absent in
the monolayer and few layer semiconducting limit. The microscopic origins of
this TMD bandstructure engineering is highlighted through detailed DFT
simulations and show that circular dichroism can be controlled when PtSe2
becomes a semimetal and when the K-valleys can be excited. As well as showing

that the anomalous torque is strongly boosted by low-energy magnon modes

direct imaging and characterization of Earth-like rocky planets, which requires
contrast limits of $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-8}$ at wavelengths from I to J band. One
critical aspect affecting the raw on-sky contrast are polarization aberrations
arising from the reflection from the telescope's mirror surfaces and instrument
optics. We simulate the polarization aberrations and estimate their effect on
the achievable contrast for three next-generation ground-based large segmented
mirror telescopes. We performed ray-tracing in Zemax and computed the
polarization aberrations and Jones pupil maps using the polarization
ray-tracing algorithm. The impact of these aberrations on the contrast is
estimated by propagating the Jones pupil maps through a set of idealized
coronagraphs using hcipy, a physical optics-based simulation framework. The
optical modeling of the giant segmented mirror telescopes (GSMTs) shows that
polarization aberrations create significant leakage through a coronagraphic
system. The dominant aberration is retardance defocus, which originates from
the steep angles on the primary and secondary mirrors. The retardance defocus
limits the contrast to $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-4}$ at 1 $\lambda/D$ at visible
wavelengths, and $10^{-5}$ to $10^{-6}$ at infrared wavelengths. The
simulations also show that the coating plays a major role in determining the
strength of the aberrations. Polarization aberrations will need to be
considered during the design of high-contrast imaging instruments for the next
generation of extremely large telescopes. This can be achieved either through
compensation optics, robust coronagraphs, specialized coatings, calibration,
and data analysis approaches or by incorporating polarimetry with high-contrast
imaging to measure these effects.

pre-training on a single modality. Our methods are complementary to the
existing pre-training or data mining approaches and can be used in a variety of
settings. Given the efficacy of the pseudolabeling method, we are planning to
publicly release the generated captions.

this challenge by introducing the notion of a V-equation, i.e. an equation

graded modal types which allow multiple uses of a resource in a controlled

Cartesian cases. Our main result is the introduction of a sound and complete
V-equational system for a lambda-calculus with graded modal types interpreted
by what we call a Lipschitz exponential comonad. We also show how to build such

require a pilot overhead equal to the number of RIS elements, which is
impractical. Herein, we propose a novel way to approximately represent the RIS

demonstrate that when the RIS has an element spacing of a quarter of the

new approach named Hierarchical Interests Fusing Network (HIFN), which consists
of four basic modules namely Short-term Interests Extractor (SIE), Long-term
Interests Extractor (LIE), Interests Fusion Module (IFM) and Interests
Disentanglement Module (IDM). Specifically, SIE is proposed to extract user's
short-term interests by integrating three fundamental interests encoders within
it namely query-dependent, target-dependent and causal-dependent interest
encoder, respectively, followed by delivering the resultant representation to
the module LIE, where it can effectively capture user long-term interests by
devising an attention mechanism with respect to the short-term interests from
SIE module. In IFM, the achieved long and short-term interests are further
fused in an adaptive manner, followed by concatenating it with original raw
context features for the final prediction result. Last but not least,
considering the entangling characteristic of long and short-term interests, IDM
further devises a self-supervised framework to disentangle long and short-term
interests. Extensive offline and online evaluations on a real-world e-commerce

Over general fields, we achieve similar results at the cost of using
exponential space by working over the exterior algebra. For a class of

approaches such as Monte Carlo Dropout have been successfully used in many

is not always clear if such ensemble-based approaches can be applied to a new
problem domain. This is the case with panoptic segmentation, where the
structure of the problem and architectures designed to solve it means that
unlike image classification or even semantic segmentation, the typical solution
of using a mean across samples cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we
demonstrate how ensemble-based uncertainty estimation approaches such as Monte

importantly a better measure of uncertainty for predictions made by the

hundreds of thousands of these advanced drones in the air simultaneously. Given
the impracticalities of training the corresponding number of expert pilots,
achieving this goal can only be realized through safe operation in either
fullautonomous or semi-autonomous modes. According to many recent studies, the
majority of flight accidents are concentrated on the last three stages of a

Phases of an airplane trip. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel
decentralized processing system for enhancing the safety factors during the
critical phases of Vertical and/or Short Take-Off and Landing (V/STOL) drones.
This has been achieved by adopting several processing and control algorithms
such as an Open Fuzzy Logic System (FLS) integrated with a Flight Rules Unit

applying several optimization techniques, this novel coarse-grained Autonomous

optimized to achieve a maximum computational processing performance of 70.82

real-world programs. However, interpreters are notoriously difficult to fuzz
effectively, as they expect highly structured inputs, which are rarely produced
by most fuzzing mutations. For this class of programs, grammar-based fuzzing
has been shown to be effective. Tools based on this approach can find bugs in
the code that is executed after parsing the interpreter inputs, by following
language-specific rules when generating and mutating test cases. Unfortunately,
grammar-based fuzzing is often unable to discover subtle bugs associated with
the parsing and handling of the language syntax. Additionally, if the grammar
provided to the fuzzer is incomplete, or does not match the implementation
completely, the fuzzer will fail to exercise important parts of the available
functionality. In this paper, we propose a new fuzzing technique, called
Token-Level Fuzzing. Instead of applying mutations either at the byte level or
at the grammar level, Token-Level Fuzzing applies mutations at the token level.
Evolutionary fuzzers can leverage this technique to both generate inputs that
are parsed successfully and generate inputs that do not conform strictly to the
grammar. As a result, the proposed approach can find bugs that neither
byte-level fuzzing nor grammar-based fuzzing can find. We evaluated Token-Level
Fuzzing by modifying AFL and fuzzing four popular JavaScript engines, finding
29 previously unknown bugs, several of which could not be found with
state-of-the-art byte-level and grammar-based fuzzers.

Both business people and public servants can adopt two strategies: corrupt or
honest behavior. Interactions between business people and public servants take
place through defined payoff rules. Either type of agent can switch between
corrupt or honest strategies by comparing their payoffs after interacting. We
measure the level of corruption in the system by the fractions of corrupt and
honest agents for asymptotic times. We study the effects of the group size of
the interacting agents, the dispersion with respect to the average salary of
the public servants, and a parameter representing the institutional control of
corruption. We characterize the fractions of honest and corrupt agents as
functions of these variables. We construct phase diagrams for the level of
corruption in the system in terms of these variables, where three collective
states can be distinguished: i) a phase where corruption dominates; ii) a phase
where corruption remains in less than $50\%$ of the agents; and iii) a phase
where corruption disappear. Our results indicate that a combination of large
group sizes of interacting servants and business people and small dispersion of

Vacuum polarisation is a \emph{strong-field} effect when all orders of
interaction between the virtual pair and the background must be taken into
account. In this investigation we show that multiple scattering processes of
this type may be observed by utilising high-energy laser pulses with long pulse
duration, such as are available at facilities like ELI Beamlines. In
combination with appropriate sources of high-energy probe photons, multiple

on an optical parametric amplifier system operating at wavelengths of 532 nm,
680 nm and 793 nm was used. The photo-bleaching performance is investigated as
a function of the wavelength and energy of the pulsed light source. It was
observed that the photo-bleaching level of the Yb-doped optical fiber increased
when the exposure time of the pulsed laser light and the photon energy was
increased. The results show that the recovery levels of color centers in the
Yb-doped optical fibers reached up to 96 % in a shorter time by using the

  machine learning correction operators trained on nudged datasets",,,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work presents a systematic framework for improving the predictions of
statistical quantities for turbulent systems, with a focus on correcting
climate simulations obtained by coarse-scale models. While high resolution
simulations or reanalysis data are available, they cannot be directly used as
training datasets to machine learn a correction for the coarse-scale climate
model outputs, since chaotic divergence, inherent in the climate dynamics,
makes datasets from different resolutions incompatible. To overcome this
fundamental limitation we employ coarse-resolution model simulations nudged
towards high quality climate realizations, here in the form of ERA5 reanalysis
data. The nudging term is sufficiently small to not pollute the coarse-scale
dynamics over short time scales, but also sufficiently large to keep the
coarse-scale simulations close to the ERA5 trajectory over larger time scales.
The result is a compatible pair of the ERA5 trajectory and the weakly nudged
coarse-resolution E3SM output that is used as input training data to machine
learn a correction operator. Once training is complete, we perform free-running
coarse-scale E3SM simulations without nudging and use those as input to the
machine-learned correction operator to obtain high-quality (corrected) outputs.
The model is applied to atmospheric climate data with the purpose of predicting
global and local statistics of various quantities of a time-period of a decade.
Using datasets that are not employed for training, we demonstrate that the
produced datasets from the ML-corrected coarse E3SM model have statistical
properties that closely resemble the observations. Furthermore, the corrected
coarse-scale E3SM output for the frequency of occurrence of extreme events,
such as tropical cyclones and atmospheric rivers are presented. We present
thorough comparisons and discuss limitations of the approach.

sensitive to the value of the local gravitational potential. This could have
observable consequences for galaxies. These consequences might be seen by
comparing two proxies for galaxy mass -- their luminosity and their internal
kinematics -- as a function of local galaxy density. Motivated by this
prospect, we have compared the observed properties of luminous red galaxies
(LRGs) inside and outside of voids in the cosmic large scale structure. We used
archival measurements of line widths, luminosities, redshifts, colors, and
positions of galaxies in conjunction with recent void catalogs to construct
comparison LRG samples inside and outside of voids. We fitted these two samples
to the well-established fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies to constrain
any differences between the inferred value of the Newtonian gravitational
constant G for the two samples. We obtained a null result, with an upper limit
on any fractional difference in G within and outside of cosmological voids to
be $\alpha =\delta$$ G/G \sim$ 40\%. This upper bound is dominated by the
small-number statistics of our N $\sim $ 100 within-void LRG sample. With the
caveat that environmental effects could influence various parameters such as
star formation, we estimate that a 1\% statistical limit on $\alpha$ could be
attained with data from 10${^5}$ elliptical galaxies within voids. This is
within the reach of future photometric and spectroscopic surveys, both of which
are required to pursue this method.

elemental production can be in mergers. Identifying signposts of the production

heavy-element synthesis. In this study, we investigate the properties of very
neutron rich nuclei for which superheavy elements ($Z\geq 104$) can be produced
in NSMs and whether they can similarly imprint a unique signature on kilonova

engineering. However, GPT models can sometimes generate plausible-sounding but

importance of prompt engineering in mitigating these risks and harnessing the
full potential of GPT for geotechnical applications. We explore the challenges
and pitfalls associated with LLMs and highlight the role of context in ensuring
accurate and valuable responses. Furthermore, we examine the development of
context-specific search engines and the potential of LLMs to become a natural
interface for complex tasks, such as data analysis and design. We also develop
a unified interface using natural language to handle complex geotechnical
engineering tasks and data analysis. By integrating GPT into geotechnical
engineering workflows, professionals can streamline their work and develop
sustainable and resilient infrastructure systems for the future.

  Debt Accumulation","Submitted to Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE)",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Software development organisations strive to maintain their effectiveness
while the complexity of the systems they develop continues to grow. To tackle
this challenge, organisations tend to be organised into small teams working
with components that can be developed separately. Here, organisations must
design their architecture and organisational structures in a way that enables
communication and minimises dependencies, and helps teams reduce code and
architectural degradation. Ensuring that each small independent team is
responsible for components they primarily contribute is one approach to
achieving this goal. This study aims at understanding the impact of ownership
and contribution alignment on accumulation of code technical debt and how
abrupt changes in team constellation affect teams' effectiveness in managing
TD. We conducted an embedded case study in a company developing a very large
software system, analysing ten components belonging to 1 team. During the
studied period, the team was split into two, and the components owned by them
were distributed between the two new teams. With high degrees of contribution
alignment, we noticed a negative correlation between contribution alignment and
TD Density before the team split. In 4 components, this correlation is
statistically significant. This means a higher contribution alignment degree
implies a lower TD Density. After the split, we observe a negative correlation
in 3 components. The positive correlation observed in the other 5 components
could be attributed to low contribution alignment, leading to difficulties in
managing TD. Our findings suggest that contribution alignment can be important
in controlling TD in software development organisations. Making teams
responsible for the quality of components they have more expertise over and
minimising dependencies between teams can help organisations mitigate the
growth of TD.

Unfortunately, this line is redshifted out of the optical band at $z\approx1$,
leaving $M_{\rm BH}$ estimates to rely on proxy rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)
emission lines, such as C IV $\lambda1549$ or Mg II $\lambda2800$, which
contain intrinsic challenges when measuring, resulting in uncertain $M_{\rm

derived from the C IV and Mg II emission lines based on estimates derived from

several continuous structure learning approaches is primarily driven by a high

that nonconvexity may be a main concern especially for the non-equal noise

isothermal two-phase material system consisting of a deformable porous solid
matrix and a fully saturating, single-phase, and compressible pore fluid
without inter-phase mass exchange. We re-derive a generalized fluid mass
balance law using fundamental transport rules. We also summarize from the
literature a fundamental force balance law for the fluid-solid mixture that
does not require any effective stress law a priori. We show that the two
conservation laws are coupled naturally to second-order without any
constitutive prerequisites. This differs from Biot poroelasticity, which first
postulates first-order fluid-solid coupling as two linearized constitutive
relationships and then enforces them into simple Eulerian form of conservation
laws. Next, we examine a limiting-case unsaturated soil mechanics framework
implemented in Abaqus, by assuming isothermal conditions, full saturation, and
no adsorption, and then relate it to our framework. We prove that (1) the two
mass balance laws are always equivalent regardless of fluid constitutive
behaviors, and (2) the two force balance laws are equivalent in their specific
forms with a linearly elastic solid skeleton. Finally, taking advantage of a
fundamental pore constitutive law, we show how our framework, and by extension
the limiting-case Abaqus framework, naturally gives rise to the distinction
between drained and undrained settings, and reduces to Biot poroelasticity
under simplifying conditions. Notably, our framework indicates the presence of
an additional solid-to-fluid coupling term when the solid particle velocity is
non-orthogonal to the Darcy velocity.

requires accessing the intrinsic timescales of electrons (femtoseconds) and
associated phonons (10s of femtoseconds to few picoseconds), which is possible
with short-pulse photoexcitation. Yet, in many Mott insulators, the electronic
transition is accompanied by the nucleation and growth of percolating domains
of the changed lattice structure, leading to empirical time scales dominated by
slow coarsening dynamics. Here, we use time-resolved X-ray diffraction and
reflectivity measurements to investigate the photoinduced insulator-to-metal
transition in an epitaxially strained thin film Mott insulator Ca2RuO4. The
dynamical transition occurs without observable domain formation and coarsening
effects, allowing the study of the intrinsic electronic and lattice dynamics.
Above a fluence threshold, the initial electronic excitation drives a fast
lattice rearrangement, followed by a slower electronic evolution into a
metastable non-equilibrium state. Microscopic calculations based on
time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory and semiclassical lattice dynamics
within a recently published equilibrium energy landscape picture explain the

measurements is a classical problem in astrodynamics. Indeed, there are many
well-established methods for performing the IOD task when given three
line-of-sight observations at known times. Interestingly, and in contrast to
these existing methods, concepts from algebraic geometry may be used to produce
a purely geometric solution. This idea is based on the fact that bearings from
observers in general position may be used to directly recover the shape and
orientation of a three-dimensional conic (e.g., a Keplerian orbit) without any
need for knowledge of time. In general, it is shown that five bearings at
unknown times are sufficient to recover the orbit -- without the use of any
type of initial guess and without the need to propagate the orbit. Three
bearings are sufficient for purely geometric IOD if the orbit is known to be
(approximately) circular. The method has been tested over different scenarios,

  In Near-surface Meridional Flow","14 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical
  Journal",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Using time-distance local helioseismology flow maps within 1 Mm of the solar
photosphere, we detect inflows toward activity belts that contribute to solar
cycle scale variations in near-surface meridional flow. These inflows stretch
out as far as 30 degrees away from active region centroids. If active region
neighborhoods are excluded, the solar cycle scale variation in background
meridional flow diminishes to below 2~m~s$^{-1}$, but still shows systematic
variations in the absence of active regions between Sunspot Cycles 24 and 25.
We, therefore, propose that the near-surface meridional flow is a three
component flow made up of: a constant baseline flow profile that can be derived
from quiet Sun regions, variations due to inflows around active regions, and
solar cycle scale variation of the order of 2~m~s$^{-1}$. Torsional
oscillation, on the other hand, is found to be a global phenomenon i.e.
exclusion of active region neighborhoods does not affect its magnitude or phase
significantly. This non-variation of torsional oscillation with distance away
from active regions and the three-component breakdown of the near-surface
meridional flow serve as vital constraints for solar dynamo models and surface
flux transport simulations.

present a largely-unexplored opportunity for improving separation models by
leveraging unlabelled music data. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised
learning framework for music source separation inspired by the HuBERT speech
representation model. We first investigate the potential impact of the original
HuBERT model by inserting an adapted version of it into the well-known Demucs
V2 time-domain separation model architecture. We then propose a
time-frequency-domain self-supervised model, Pac-HuBERT (for primitive auditory
clustering HuBERT), that we later use in combination with a Res-U-Net decoder
for source separation. Pac-HuBERT uses primitive auditory features of music as
unsupervised clustering labels to initialize the self-supervised pretraining
process using the Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset. The resulting framework
achieves better source-to-distortion ratio (SDR) performance on the MusDB18
test set than the original Demucs V2 and Res-U-Net models. We further
demonstrate that it can boost performance with small amounts of supervised

moderately elevated temperatures (300-400$^{\circ}$C) due to a combination of
non-stoichiometric Ti/Ga$_2$O$_3$ interfacial reactions and kinetically favored
Ti diffusion processes. Here we demonstrate stable Ohmic contacts for
Ga$_2$O$_3$ devices operating up to 500-600$^{\circ}$C using ultrathin Ti
layers with a self-limiting interfacial reaction. The ultrathin Ti layer in the
5nm Ti / 100nm Au contact stack is designed to fully oxidize while forming an
Ohmic contact, thereby limiting both thermodynamic and kinetic instability.
This novel contact design strategy results in an epitaxial conductive anatase
titanium oxide interface layer that enables low-resistance Ohmic contacts that
are stable both under long-term continuous operation (>500 hours) at
600$^{\circ}$C in vacuum ($\leq$ 10$^{-4}$ Torr), as well as after repeated
thermal cycling (15 times) between room temperature and 550$^{\circ}$C in

of high-temperature devices by enabling research focus to shift towards
rectifying contacts and other interfacial layers.

capturing ground-truth spectral reflectance and camera spectral sensitivity are
challenging and costly, most existing approaches are trained on synthetic
images and utilize the same parameters for all unseen testing images, which are
suboptimal especially when the trained models are tested on real images because
they never exploit the internal information of the testing images. To address
this issue, we adopt a self-supervised meta-auxiliary learning (MAXL) strategy
that fine-tunes the well-trained network parameters with each testing image to
combine external with internal information. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work that successfully adapts the MAXL strategy to this problem.
Instead of relying on naive end-to-end training, we also propose a novel
architecture that integrates the physical relationship between the spectral
reflectance and the corresponding RGB images into the network based on our
mathematical analysis. Besides, since the spectral reflectance of a scene is
independent to its illumination while the corresponding RGB images are not, we
recover the spectral reflectance of a scene from its RGB images captured under
multiple illuminations to further reduce the unknown. Qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed network

Hierarchical Autoregressive Language mOdel (HALO) for generating longitudinal
high-dimensional EHR, which preserve the statistical properties of real EHR and
can be used to train accurate ML models without privacy concerns. Our HALO
method, designed as a hierarchical autoregressive model, generates a
probability density function of medical codes, clinical visits, and patient

unaggregated form without the need for variable selection or aggregation.
Additionally, our model also produces high-quality continuous variables in a
longitudinal and probabilistic manner. We conducted extensive experiments and
demonstrate that HALO can generate high-fidelity EHR data with high-dimensional
disease code probabilities (d > 10,000), disease co-occurrence probabilities
within visits (d > 1,000,000), and conditional probabilities across consecutive
visits (d > 5,000,000) and achieve above 0.9 R2 correlation in comparison to
real EHR data. This performance then enables downstream ML models trained on
its synthetic data to achieve comparable accuracy to models trained on real

indicate formation of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) when compared with results
from control $p$-A or $d$-A collisions. However, subsequent analyses of such
control systems are now also interpreted to indicate QGP formation, calling
into question proper interpretation of NMFs. An additional complication is the
nature of the so-called ``Cronin effect'' contribution to NMF structure that is
not well understood. In the present study a two-component model of hadron
production (TCM) is applied to identified-hadron (PID) $p_t$ spectra from 5 GeV
$p$-Pb collisions extending up to 20 GeV/c. Hard components (jet fragment
distributions) are accurately isolated and their evolution with collision
centrality parametrized. The TCM is then applied to NMFs without rescaling by
$N_{bin}$, allowing direct comparisons between NMF evolution and hard-component
evolution with centrality. To address the Cronin effect the TCM is applied to
fixed-target $p$-A spectra from the Chicago-Princeton (C-P) collaboration, the
origin of the Cronin effect. Inferred C-P spectrum hard components are
quantitatively consistent with extrapolation of jet-related structure from
higher energies. As a general conclusion spectrum ratios such as NMFs are
difficult to interpret, whereas direct differential analysis of isolated

polarisation, which is widely used for sunglasses, liquid-crystal displays,
digital-coherent communications, while orbital angular momentum is useful for
optical tweezers, laser-patterning, and quantum optics. However, spin and
orbital angular momentum of photons are considered to be impossible for
splitting into two independent degrees of freedom in a proper gauge invariant
way, proved by plane wave expansions in a free space. Here, we show these
degrees of freedom are well-defined quantum observables in a waveguide and a
free space as far as the propagation mode is sufficiently confined in the core.
We found Stokes parameters are spin expectation values of coherent photons,
which exhibit non-trivial topological features like a torus, a M\""obius strip,
and a bosonic Dirac cone. We have applied an SU(N) representation theory to
describe both spin and orbital angular momentum of photons, and experimentally
demonstrated their controls over a full Poincar\'e sphere to show a fullerene
C$_{60}$ and the earth by qubits. We have also ascribed topological colour
charge to photonic orbital angular momentum, whose SU(3) states are shown on a
proposed Gell-Mann hypersphere in SO(8), whose parameters could be embedded in
SO(5). We have also realised photonic SU(4) states of singlet and triplet
states, which were successfully projected into SU(2)$\times$SU(2) states by a
rotated polariser. Our results indicate that our platform of manipulating spin
and orbital angular momentum is useful for exploring a photonic quantum
chromodynamics and a higher order macroscopic quantum state.

the largest and the most well-observed flash event detected by ground-based
movie observations. The observed long-duration ($\sim 5.5~{\rm s}$) optical
emission can be reproduced by an impact of an object with an exceptionally
small angle of entry relative to the horizontal. The apparent lack of the
impact debris feature despite the large impact object was possibly due to the
shallower angle of entry ($\le 12^\circ$), which resulted in the lower ablation
per unit volume at altitudes higher than $50 \, {\rm km}$, and the volume
densities of the ablated materials were too low to allow the debris
particulates to coagulate. The absence of temporal methane absorption change in
the observed flash spectrum is consistent with the best-fit results. The model
better fits the observed optical energy profile for weaker material (cometary
and stony) cases than for metallic ones. Based on the simulation results,
prospects for future observations of impact flashes are discussed.

real-time inference at the on-board compute is an absolute necessity. This

While most of the existing methods for M-CIG are based on generative

demonstrated the superiority of diffusion models over GANs. In this paper, we
propose a diffusion-based method for M-CIG named conditional denoising

conditioning scheme to generate the target image based on the fusion results.
To prioritize the semantic quality of the generated target image, we learn an
auxiliary image compositional match (ICM) objective, along with the conditional
denoising diffusion (CDD) objective in a multi-task learning framework.
Additionally, we also perform ICM guidance and classifier-free guidance to
improve performance. Experimental results show that CDD-ICM achieves

additional edges $H$ that, when added to $G$, maintains its graph metric but
guarantees that all node pairs have a shortest path in $G \cup H$ using at most
$D$ edges. A shortcut set is the analogous concept for reachability. These
objects have been studied since the early '90s due to applications in parallel,
distributed, dynamic, and streaming graph algorithms.
  For most of their history, the state-of-the-art construction for either
object was a simple folklore algorithm, based on randomly sampling nodes to hit
long paths in the graph. However, recent breakthroughs of Kogan and Parter
[SODA '22] and Bernstein and Wein [SODA '23] have finally improved over the
folklore diameter bound of $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/2})$ for shortcut sets and for
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate hopsets. For both objects it is now known that one
can use $O(n)$ hop-edges to reduce diameter to $\widetilde{O}(n^{1/3})$. The
only setting where folklore sampling remains unimproved is for exact hopsets.
Can these improvements be continued?
  We settle this question negatively by constructing graphs on which any exact
hopset of $O(n)$ edges has diameter $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/2})$. This
improves on the previous lower bound of $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/3})$ by Kogan
and Parter [FOCS '22]. Using similar ideas, we also polynomially improve the
current lower bounds for shortcut sets, constructing graphs on which any
shortcut set of $O(n)$ edges reduces diameter to $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/4})$.
This improves on the previous lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1/6})$ by Huang and
Pettie [SIAM J. Disc. Math. '18]. We also extend our constructions to provide
lower bounds against $O(p)$-size exact hopsets and shortcut sets for other
values of $p$; in particular, we show that folklore sampling is near-optimal
for exact hopsets in the entire range of $p \in [1, n^2]$.

formulated under this nonseparable link cost structure as well as explicit

existence, uniqueness, and global stability of the equilibria. In terms of
dealing with stochastic equilibrium with explicit capacity constraints and

the conformational ensembles and flexibility that underlie biological function.
Towards this goal, we develop EigenFold, a diffusion generative modeling
framework for sampling a distribution of structures from a given protein
sequence. We define a diffusion process that models the structure as a system
of harmonic oscillators and which naturally induces a cascading-resolution
generative process along the eigenmodes of the system. On recent CAMEO targets,
EigenFold achieves a median TMScore of 0.84, while providing a more
comprehensive picture of model uncertainty via the ensemble of sampled
structures relative to existing methods. We then assess EigenFold's ability to
model and predict conformational heterogeneity for fold-switching proteins and
ligand-induced conformational change. Code is available at

  Annotation","10 pages, 5 figures, Accepted by CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Rotated bounding boxes drastically reduce output ambiguity of elongated
objects, making it superior to axis-aligned bounding boxes. Despite the
effectiveness, rotated detectors are not widely employed. Annotating rotated
bounding boxes is such a laborious process that they are not provided in many
detection datasets where axis-aligned annotations are used instead. In this
paper, we propose a framework that allows the model to predict precise rotated
boxes only requiring cheaper axis-aligned annotation of the target dataset 1.
To achieve this, we leverage the fact that neural networks are capable of
learning richer representation of the target domain than what is utilized by
the task. The under-utilized representation can be exploited to address a more
detailed task. Our framework combines task knowledge of an out-of-domain source
dataset with stronger annotation and domain knowledge of the target dataset
with weaker annotation. A novel assignment process and projection loss are used
to enable the co-training on the source and target datasets. As a result, the
model is able to solve the more detailed task in the target domain, without
additional computation overhead during inference. We extensively evaluate the
method on various target datasets including fresh-produce dataset, HRSC2016 and
SSDD. Results show that the proposed method consistently performs on par with
the fully supervised approach.

study of static version of the attention multiplication problem [Zandieh, Han,
Daliri, and Karbasi arXiv 2023, Alman and Song arXiv 2023]. In this work, we
formally define a dynamic version of attention matrix multiplication problem.
There are matrices $Q,K, V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$, they represent query,

there is no algorithm that can use both $O(n^{\omega(1,1,\tau) - \tau-

PIKS technique produces results consistent with other techniques such as the
auto-encoder. However, the auto-encoder needs to be trained, which requires
several parameters to be tuned. In comparison, the PIKS technique has far fewer
parameters to tune. This makes it advantageous for fast, ""out-of-the-box"" data
exploration. The PIKS technique is scalable and can readily ingest new
datasets. Hence, it can provide valuable, up-to-date insights to citizens,

long-lived structures called open clusters (OCs). Along their dynamical
evolution, their gradual depletion leave some imprints on their structure. In
this work, we employed astrometric, photometric and spectroscopic data from the
\textit{Gaia} DR3 catalogue to uniformly characterize a sample of 60 OCs.
Structural parameters (tidal, core and half-light radii, respectively, $r_t$,
$r_c$ and $r_h$), age, mass ($M_{\textrm{clu}}$), distance, reddening, besides
Jacobi radius ($R_J$) and half-light relaxation time ($t_{rh}$), are derived
from radial density profiles and astrometrically decontaminated
colour-magnitude diagrams. Ages and Galactocentric distances ($R_G$) range from
7.2$\,\lesssim\,$log($t.$yr$^{-1}$)$\,\lesssim\,$9.8 and
6$\,\lesssim\,R_G$(kpc)$\,\lesssim\,$12. Analytical expressions derived from
$N$-body simulations, taken from the literature, are also employed to estimate
the OC initial mass ($M_{\textrm{ini}}$) and mass loss due to exclusively
dynamical effects. Both $r_c$ and the tidal filling ratio, $r_h/R_J$, tend to
decrease with the dynamical age (=$t/t_{rh}$), indicating the shrinking of the
OCs' internal structure as consequence of internal dynamical relaxation. This
dependence seems differentially affected by the external tidal field, since OCs
at smaller $R_G$ tend to be dynamically older and have smaller
$M_{\textrm{clu}}/M_{\textrm{ini}}$ ratios. In this sense, for
$R_G\lesssim8\,$kpc, the $r_h/R_J$ ratio presents a slight positive correlation
with $R_G$. Beyond this limit, there is a dichotomy in which more massive OCs
tend to be more compact and therefore less subject to tidal stripping in
comparison to those less massive and looser OCs at similar $R_G$. Besides, the
$r_t/R_J$ ratio also tends to correlate positively with $R_G$.

  Masked Multi-scale Reconstruction","submit to Computers in Industry",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) is crucial for automating industrial
quality inspection. The diversity of the datasets is the foundation for
developing comprehensive IAD algorithms. Existing IAD datasets focus on the
diversity of data categories, overlooking the diversity of domains within the
same data category. In this paper, to bridge this gap, we propose the
Aero-engine Blade Anomaly Detection (AeBAD) dataset, consisting of two
sub-datasets: the single-blade dataset and the video anomaly detection dataset
of blades. Compared to existing datasets, AeBAD has the following two
characteristics: 1.) The target samples are not aligned and at different
scales. 2.) There is a domain shift between the distribution of normal samples
in the test set and the training set, where the domain shifts are mainly caused
by the changes in illumination and view. Based on this dataset, we observe that
current state-of-the-art (SOTA) IAD methods exhibit limitations when the domain
of normal samples in the test set undergoes a shift. To address this issue, we
propose a novel method called masked multi-scale reconstruction (MMR), which
enhances the model's capacity to deduce causality among patches in normal
samples by a masked reconstruction task. MMR achieves superior performance
compared to SOTA methods on the AeBAD dataset. Furthermore, MMR achieves
competitive performance with SOTA methods to detect the anomalies of different
types on the MVTec AD dataset. Code and dataset are available at

the quality of the peak fit. Two chemical parameters on the surface, sp$^2$ C

are unlikely to be available for the target domain in the training phase. To
solve this problem, we propose a domain adaptation method for SSAD where no
anomalous data are available for the target domain. First, we introduce a
domain-adversarial network to a variational auto-encoder-based SSAD model to
obtain domain-invariant latent variables. Since the decoder cannot reconstruct
the original data solely from domain-invariant latent variables, we conditioned
the decoder on the domain label. To compensate for the missing anomalous data
of the target domain, we introduce an importance sampling-based weighted loss
function that approximates the ideal loss function. Experimental results
indicate that the proposed method helps adapt SSAD models to the target domain

training, consisting of a warm-up and a self-training stage. However, this

widely adopted adversarial training often results in limited performance gain,
due to blind feature alignment; for self-training, finding proper categorical
thresholds is very tricky. To alleviate these issues, we first propose to
replace the adversarial training in the warm-up stage by a novel symmetric
knowledge distillation module that only accesses the source domain data and
makes the model domain generalizable. Surprisingly, this domain generalizable
warm-up model brings substantial performance improvement, which can be further
amplified via our proposed cross-domain mixture data augmentation technique.
Then, for the self-training stage, we propose a threshold-free dynamic
pseudo-label selection mechanism to ease the aforementioned threshold problem

over the sample space $\mathcal{X}$, and the maximum entropy achievable scales
proportionately with the sample space cardinality $|\mathcal{X}|$. For a finite
$|\mathcal{X}|$, this yields robust entropy measures which satisfy many
important properties, such as invariance to bijections, while the same is not
true for continuous spaces (where $|\mathcal{X}|=\infty$). Furthermore, since
$\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\in \mathbb{Z}^+$) have the same cardinality
(from Cantor's correspondence argument), cardinality-dependent entropy measures
cannot encode the data dimensionality. In this work, we question the role of
cardinality and distribution spread in defining entropy measures for continuous
spaces, which can undergo multiple rounds of transformations and distortions,
e.g., in neural networks. We find that the average value of the local intrinsic
dimension of a distribution, denoted as ID-Entropy, can serve as a robust
entropy measure for continuous spaces, while capturing the data dimensionality.
We find that ID-Entropy satisfies many desirable properties and can be extended
to conditional entropy, joint entropy and mutual-information variants.
ID-Entropy also yields new information bottleneck principles and also links to
causality. In the context of deep learning, for feedforward architectures, we
show, theoretically and empirically, that the ID-Entropy of a hidden layer
directly controls the generalization gap for both classifiers and
auto-encoders, when the target function is Lipschitz continuous. Our work
primarily shows that, for continuous spaces, taking a structural rather than a

a bimodality of stellar rotation distribution drives the MS bifurcation.
Nevertheless, the origin of the stellar rotation dichotomy remains unclear.
Hypotheses involving tidally-locked binaries or blue straggler stars (BSSs) are
proposed to explain the observed split MSs. This work examines if the long-term
dynamical evolution of star clusters can produce the observed split MSs,
through high-performance $N$-body simulation. As a prototype example, the young
massive cluster NGC 1856 exhibits an apparent MS bifurcation. Our simulation
reports that at the age of NGC 1856, tidally-locked binaries are fully mixed
with single stars. This is consistent with the observation that there is no
significant spatial difference between blue MS and red MS stars. However, we
find that only high mass-ratio binaries can evolve to the tidally-locked phase
at the age of the NGC 1856. These tidally-locked binaries will populate a much
redder sequence than the MS of single stars rather than a blue MS, which is
inconsistent with the hypothesis. The number of tidally-locked binaries cannot
account for the observation. Our simulation shows that BSSs produced by binary
interactions do populate the blue periphery in the color-magnitude diagram, and
their spatial distribution shows a similar pattern of single stars. However,
the number of BSSs does not fit the observation.

multiple signals and latent variables. This model, which we call a matrix GLM,
covers many widely studied problems in statistical learning, including mixed
linear regression, max-affine regression, and mixture-of-experts. In mixed
linear regression, each observation comes from one of $L$ signal vectors
(regressors), but we do not know which one; in max-affine regression, each
observation comes from the maximum of $L$ affine functions, each defined via a
different signal vector. The goal in all these problems is to estimate the
signals, and possibly some of the latent variables, from the observations. We
propose a novel approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for estimation in a
matrix GLM and rigorously characterize its performance in the high-dimensional
limit. This characterization is in terms of a state evolution recursion, which
allows us to precisely compute performance measures such as the asymptotic
mean-squared error. The state evolution characterization can be used to tailor
the AMP algorithm to take advantage of any structural information known about
the signals. Using state evolution, we derive an optimal choice of AMP
`denoising' functions that minimizes the estimation error in each iteration.
  The theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations for mixed
linear regression, max-affine regression, and mixture-of-experts. For
max-affine regression, we propose an algorithm that combines AMP with
expectation-maximization to estimate intercepts of the model along with the
signals. The numerical results show that AMP significantly outperforms other
estimators for mixed linear regression and max-affine regression in most
parameter regimes.

  note: text overlap with arXiv:2212.13368",,,,"cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Wind energy has been rapidly gaining popularity as a means for combating
climate change. However, the variable nature of wind generation can undermine
system reliability and lead to wind curtailment, causing substantial economic
losses to wind power producers. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) that
serve as onsite backup sources are among the solutions to mitigate wind
curtailment. However, such an auxiliary role of the BESS might severely weaken
its economic viability. This paper addresses the issue by proposing joint wind
curtailment reduction and energy arbitrage for the BESS. We decouple the market
participation of the co-located wind-battery system and develop a joint-bidding
framework for the wind farm and BESS. It is challenging to optimize the
joint-bidding because of the stochasticity of energy prices and wind
generation. Therefore, we leverage deep reinforcement learning to maximize the
overall revenue from the spot market while unlocking the BESS's potential in
concurrently reducing wind curtailment and conducting energy arbitrage. We
validate the proposed strategy using realistic wind farm data and demonstrate
that our joint-bidding strategy responds better to wind curtailment and
generates higher revenues than the optimization-based benchmark. Our
simulations also reveal that the extra wind generation used to be curtailed can
be an effective power source to charge the BESS, resulting in additional
financial returns.

to the previous proofs [NW99, Bes05], our proof is considerably elementary.
Specifically, our proof consists of basic linear algebra without using the
knowledge of Boolean function analysis and adversary methods. Qualitatively,
our bound is tight in the low success probability regime and offers a more
fine-grained trade-off. In particular, we prove that for any $\epsilon > 0, p

obtain an ${\epsilon}$-approximation for the phase with probability at least p.
However, the existing bounds hold only when $p > 1/2$. Quantitatively, our
bound is tight since it matches the well-known phase estimation algorithm of
Cleve, Ekert, Macchiavello, and Mosca [CEMM98] which requires $O(1/{\epsilon})$

random-access memory (MRAM). Recently, experiments show that some material with
low-symmetric crystalline or magnetic structures can generate anomalous SOT
that has an out-of-plane component, which is crucial in switching perpendicular
magnetization of adjacent ferromagnetic (FM) layer in the field-free condition.
In this work, we analytically derive the threshold current of field-free
perpendicular magnetization switching using the anomalous SOT. And we
numerically calculate the track of the magnetic moment in a FM free layer when
an applied current is smaller and greater than the threshold current. After
that, we study the applied current dependence of the switching time and the
switching energy consumption, which shows the minimum energy consumption
decreases as out-of-plane torque proportion increases. Then we study the
dependences of the threshold current on anisotropy strength, out-of-plane
torque proportion, FM free layer thickness and Gilbert damping constant, and
the threshold current shows negative correlation with the out-of-plane torque
proportion and positive correlation with the other three parameters. Finally,
we demonstrate that when the applied current is smaller than the threshold
current, although it cannot switch the magnetization of FM free layer, it can
still equivalently add an effective exchange bias field H_{bias} on the FM free
layer. The H_{bias} is proportional to the applied current J_{SOT}, which
facilitates the determination of the anomalous SOT efficiency. This work helps
us to design new spintronic devices that favor field-free switching
perpendicular magnetization using the anomalous SOT, and provides a way to
adjust the exchange bias field, which is helpful in controlling FM layer
magnetization depinning.

densely resampled to have the same number of vertices with equal-spaced

generation through a large language model, which infers action language from
natural language instruction and environment state. The robot then zooms to the
fine-resolution inference part to perform the concrete action corresponding to
the action language. Fine-resolution inference is constructed as a Markov

observations and outputs the action. The results of action execution in
environments provide feedback for subsequent coarse-resolution reasoning. Such

extremely large model capacity and broad training data. However, in practice,
downstream scenarios may only support a small model due to the limited
computational resources or efficiency considerations. Moreover, the data used
for pretraining foundation models are usually invisible and very different from
the target data of downstream tasks. This brings a critical challenge for the
real-world application of foundation models: one has to transfer the knowledge
of a foundation model to the downstream task that has a quite different
architecture with only downstream target data. Existing transfer learning or
knowledge distillation methods depend on either the same model structure or
finetuning of the foundation model. Thus, naively introducing these methods can
be either infeasible or very inefficient. To address this, we propose a
Task-Driven Model Reprogramming (TDMR) framework. Specifically, we reprogram
the foundation model to project the knowledge into a proxy space, which
alleviates the adverse effect of task mismatch and domain inconsistency. Then,
we reprogram the target model via progressive distillation from the proxy space
to efficiently learn the knowledge from the reprogrammed foundation model. TDMR
is compatible with different pre-trained model types (CNN, transformer or their
mix) and limited target data, and promotes the wide applications of vision
foundation models to downstream tasks in a cost-effective manner. Extensive
experiments on different downstream classification tasks and target model
structures demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods with both CNNs and
transformer foundation models.

sufficiently clear how well considering these components allows one to predict
behavior after persuasive attempts, especially in the long run. Since
collecting data for many algorithm components is costly and places a burden on
users, a better understanding of the impact of individual components in
practice is welcome. This can help to make an informed decision on which
components to use. We thus conducted a longitudinal study in which a virtual
coach persuaded 671 daily smokers to do preparatory activities for quitting
smoking and becoming more physically active, such as envisioning one's desired
future self. Based on the collected data, we designed a Reinforcement Learning

the activities, on the other hand, only help to predict behavior if used in

one context and not in another. This ambiguity motivates the creation of
metrics for specific contexts. This work explores the ability of deep
perceptual similarity (DPS) metrics to adapt to a given context. DPS metrics
use the deep features of neural networks for comparing images. These metrics
have been successful on datasets that leverage the average human perception in
limited settings. But the question remains if they could be adapted to specific
similarity contexts. No single metric can suit all similarity contexts, and
previous rule-based metrics are labor-intensive to rewrite for new contexts. On
the other hand, DPS metrics use neural networks that might be retrained for
each context. However, retraining networks takes resources and might ruin
performance on previous tasks. This work examines the adaptability of DPS
metrics by training ImageNet pretrained CNNs to measure similarity according to
given contexts. Contexts are created by randomly ranking six image distortions.
Distortions later in the ranking are considered more disruptive to similarity
when applied to an image for that context. This also gives insight into whether
the pretrained features capture different similarity contexts. The adapted
metrics are evaluated on a perceptual similarity dataset to evaluate if
adapting to a ranking affects their prior performance. The findings show that
DPS metrics can be adapted with high performance. While the adapted metrics
have difficulties with the same contexts as baselines, performance is improved
in 99% of cases. Finally, it is shown that the adaption is not significantly
detrimental to prior performance on perceptual similarity. The implementation

$H$ in an arbitrary surface $\Sigma$. If $H$ satisfies certain connectivity
condition, then $\textrm{cr}_{\Sigma}(H\Box T)$ is not less than the sum of the
crossing numbers of its ``subgraphs"". In this paper, we introduced a new
concept of generalized periodic graphs, which contains $H\Box C_n$. For a

are constructed to compute lower bounds on the crossing number of generalized

lower bounds on an infinite family of generalized periodic graphs, by
determining a lower bound on the crossing number of a finite generalized
periodic graph.

networks focus on different facial regions, and the sensitive regions of
darker-skinned people are much smaller. Based on this discovery, we propose a
new de-bias method based on gradient attention, called Gradient Attention
Balance Network (GABN). Specifically, we use the gradient attention map (GAM)
of the face recognition network to track the sensitive facial regions and make
the GAMs of different races tend to be consistent through adversarial learning.
This method mitigates the bias by making the network focus on similar facial
regions. In addition, we also use masks to erase the Top-N sensitive facial
regions, forcing the network to allocate its attention to a larger facial
region. This method expands the sensitive region of darker-skinned people and
further reduces the gap between GAM of darker-skinned people and GAM of
Caucasians. Extensive experiments show that GABN successfully mitigates racial
bias in face recognition and learns more balanced performance for people of
different races.

one century show that the expected gravitomagnetic signatures of some
observables such as the satellites' right ascension $\alpha$ and declination
$\delta$ are as large as tens of arcseconds for Io, while for Callisto they
drop to the $\simeq 0.2\,\mathrm{arcseconds}$ level; the shifts in the
transverse component $T$ of the orbit range from 40 km for Io to 2 km for
Callisto. Major competing effects due to the mismodeling in the zonal
multipoles $J_\ell,\,\ell=2,\,3,\,4,\,\ldots$ of the Jovian non-spherically
symmetric gravity field and in the Jupiter's spin axis ${\boldsymbol{\hat{k}}}$
should have a limited impact, especially in view of the future improvements in
determing such parameters expected after the completion of the ongoing Juno
mission in the next few years. Present-day accuracy in knowing the orbits of
Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto is of the order of 10 milliarcseconds, to be
likely further improved by the approved JUICE and Clipper missions. This
suggests that the Lense-Thirring effect in the main Jovian system of moons
might be detectable with dedicated data reductions in which the gravitomagnetic
field is explicitly modeled and solved-for.

  Integrating Internal LR and HR Joint Feature Learning",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Pest counting, which predicts the number of pests in the early stage, is very
important because it enables rapid pest control, reduces damage to crops, and
improves productivity. In recent years, light traps have been increasingly used
to lure and photograph pests for pest counting. However, pest images have a
wide range of variability in pest appearance owing to severe occlusion, wide
pose variation, and even scale variation. This makes pest counting more
challenging. To address these issues, this study proposes a new pest counting
model referred to as multiscale and deformable attention CenterNet
(Mada-CenterNet) for internal low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR)
joint feature learning. Compared with the conventional CenterNet, the proposed
Mada-CenterNet adopts a multiscale heatmap generation approach in a two-step
fashion to predict LR and HR heatmaps adaptively learned to scale variations,
that is, changes in the number of pests. In addition, to overcome the pose and
occlusion problems, a new between-hourglass skip connection based on deformable
and multiscale attention is designed to ensure internal LR and HR joint feature
learning and incorporate geometric deformation, thereby resulting in an
improved pest counting accuracy. Through experiments, the proposed
Mada-CenterNet is verified to generate the HR heatmap more accurately and
improve pest counting accuracy owing to multiscale heatmap generation, joint
internal feature learning, and deformable and multiscale attention. In
addition, the proposed model is confirmed to be effective in overcoming severe
occlusions and variations in pose and scale. The experimental results show that
the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art crowd counting and object
detection models.

cycles. With a view to understanding which small mass-action systems admit
oscillation, in this paper we study rank-two networks with bimolecular source
complexes but allow target complexes with higher molecularities. As our goal is
to find oscillatory networks of minimal size, we focus on networks with three
reactions, the minimum number that is required for oscillation. However, some
of our intermediate results are valid in greater generality.
  One key finding is that an isolated periodic orbit cannot occur in a
three-reaction, trimolecular, mass-action system with bimolecular sources. In
fact, we characterise all networks in this class that admit a periodic orbit;
in every case all nearby orbits are periodic too. Apart from the well-known
Lotka and Ivanova reactions, we identify another network in this class that
admits a center. This new network exhibits a vertical Andronov--Hopf
bifurcation.
  Furthermore, we characterise all two-species, three-reaction,
bimolecular-sourced networks that admit an Andronov--Hopf bifurcation with
mass-action kinetics. These include two families of networks that admit a
supercritical Andronov--Hopf bifurcation, and hence a stable limit cycle. These
networks necessarily have a target complex with a molecularity of at least
four, and it turns out that there are exactly four such networks that are
tetramolecular.

More specifically, motivated by the constraint that directly designates (the
upper bound of) the number of knots to be used, we present an (unconstrained)
regularized least square reformulation, which is later shown to be equivalent
to the motivating cardinality-constrained formulation. The obtained formulation
is further modified so that we can employ a proximal gradient-type algorithm,
known as GIST, for a class of non-smooth non-convex optimization problems. We
show that under a mild technical assumption, the algorithm is shown to reach a
local minimum of the problem. Since it is shown that any local minimum of the

used to obtain a spline regression model that depends only on a designated

interaction with the Galactic centre that dynamically changed in the past.
  Methods. We simulated the orbits of 147 globular clusters over 10 Gyr
lookback time using the parallel N-body code phi-GPU. For each globular
cluster, we generated 1000 sets of initial data with random proper motions and
radial velocities based on the observed values. To distinguish globular
clusters interacting with the galactic centre, we used the criterion of a
relative distance of less than 100 pc. We used four external potentials from
the IllustrisTNG-100 database, which were selected for their similarity to the
present-day Milky Way, to simulate the structure of the Galaxy at different
times.
  Results. We obtained 3-4 globular cluster interactions per Gyr at distances
of less than 50 pc and 5-6 interactions per Gyr at distances of less than 80 pc
among the studied 147 globular clusters that had close passages near the
Galactic centre. We selected 10 of them for detailed study and found almost
100% probability of interaction with the Galactic centre for six of them.
  Conclusions. According to our results, the maximum interaction frequency of
globular clusters with the Galactic centre in the Milky Way is likely to be a
few dozens of passages per Gyr within a central zone of 100 pc. This low
frequency may not be sufficient to fully explain the relatively high mass (of
order 10^7 Msol) of the nuclear star cluster in the Milky Way, if we consider
only the periodic capture of stars from globular clusters during close
encounters. Therefore, we must also consider the possibility that some early
globular clusters were completely tidally disrupted during interactions with
the forming nuclear star cluster and the Galactic centre.

deployed in the real-world. The problem addressed by this paper is the
following: Suppose we obtain an optimal trajectory by solving a control problem
in the training environment, how do we ensure that the real-world system
trajectory tracks this optimal trajectory with minimal amount of error in a
deployment environment. In other words, we want to learn how we can adapt an
optimal trained policy to distribution shifts in the environment. Distribution
shifts are problematic in safety-critical systems, where a trained policy may
lead to unsafe outcomes during deployment. We show that this problem can be
cast as a nonlinear optimization problem that could be solved using heuristic
method such as particle swarm optimization (PSO). However, if we instead
consider a convex relaxation of this problem, we can learn policies that track
the optimal trajectory with much better error performance, and faster
computation times. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on tracking an
optimal path using a Dubin's car model, and collision avoidance using both a
linear and nonlinear model for adaptive cruise control.

many applications including optical manipulation, imaging and communication.
However, their superior features during linear propagation could be easily
corrupted by optical nonlinearity or spatial incoherence individually. Here we
investigate how the interaction of spatial incoherence and nonlinear
propagation affect the beam quality of Airy beam, and find that the two
destroying factors can in fact balance each other. Our results show that the
influence of coherence and nonlinearity on the propagation of PIABs can be
formulated as two exponential functions that have factors of opposite signs.
With appropriate spatial coherence length, the PIABs not only resist the
corruption of beam profile caused by self-focusing nonlinearity, but also
exhibits less anomalous diffraction caused by the self-defocusing nonlinearity.
Our work provides deep insight into how to maintain the beam quality of
self-accelerating Airy beams by exploiting the interaction between partially

handle irregularly sampled data and model long-term dependency. Also, the
promising experimental results of using large convolutional kernels have

multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), is by far the most prevalent approach to
implementing continuous convolution. However, there are a few drawbacks, such
as high computational costs, complex hyperparameter tuning, and limited

inspect-and-report scenarios. A centralized auction-based task allocation
system is proposed, where an auction system takes into consideration bids
submitted by the agents for individual tasks, current length of the queues and
the waiting times of the tasks in the queues to decide on a task allocation
strategy. The costs associated with these considerations, along with the
constraints of having unique mappings between tasks and agents and constraints
on the maximum number of agents that can be assigned to a queue, results in a
Linear Integer Program (LIP) that is solved using the SCIP solver. For the
scenario where the queue lengths are penalized but not the waiting times, we
demonstrate that the auction system allocates tasks in a manner that all the
queue lengths become constant, which is termed balancing. For the scenarios
where both the costs are considered, we qualitatively analyse the effect of the
choice of the relative weights on the resulting task allocation and provide
guidelines for the choice of the weights. We present simulation results that
illustrate the balanced allocation of tasks and validate the analysis for the
trade-off between the costs related to queue lengths and task waiting times.

the task of compositional generalization. Unlike prior works, we treat this as

The groundbreaking Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm reduces DFT time

further acceleration through parallel architectures such as GPUs.
Unfortunately, accelerators such as GPUs cannot exploit their full computing
capabilities as memory access becomes the bottleneck. Therefore, this paper
accelerates the FFT algorithm using digital Processing-in-Memory (PIM)
architectures that shift computation into the memory by exploiting physical
devices capable of storage and logic (e.g., memristors). We propose an O(log n)

algorithm to O(log n) polynomial multiplication - a fundamental task for
applications such as cryptography. We evaluate FourierPIM on a
publicly-available cycle-accurate simulator that verifies both correctness and
performance, and demonstrate 5-15x throughput and 4-13x energy improvement over

uncertainty, faithfully representing endogenous uncertainty still proves
challenging, both in terms of modeling capabilities and computational

approach for solving such decision problems using off-the-shelf mathematical
optimization solvers. This is made possible by using influence diagrams to
represent a given decision problem, which is then formulated as a mixed-integer
linear programming problem.
  In this paper, we focus on the type of endogenous uncertainty that received
less attention in the introduction of Decision Programming: conditionally
observed information. Multi-stage stochastic programming (MSSP) models use
conditional non-anticipativity constraints (C-NACs) to represent such
uncertainties, and we show how such constraints can be incorporated into
Decision Programming models. This allows us to consider the two main types of
endogenous uncertainty simultaneously, namely decision-dependent information
structure and decision-dependent probability distribution. Additionally, we
present a decomposition approach that provides significant computational
savings and also enables considering continuous decision variables in certain
parts of the problem, whereas the original formulation was restricted to
discrete variables only.
  The extended framework is illustrated with two example problems. The first
considers an illustrative multiperiod game and the second is a large-scale

of a very peculiar character. For example, the real space trajectories
corresponding to electron-electron scattering can have three reversal points,
reversal points at non-zero radial momentum and other unusual features. Despite
the repulsive Coulomb interaction, two electrons can be coupled forming a
composite quasi-particle - the bi-electron. The bi-electron corresponds to
excited states of the two-electron system. Because the bi-electron coupled
states exist in continuum of extended (free) states of the electron pair, these
states are quasi-resonant and have finite times of life. We found that rotating
bi-electron is a long-living composite quasi-particle. The rotating
bi-electrons can be in motion. For slowly moving bi-electrons, we determined
the kinetic energy and the effective mass. Due to strongly nonparabolic energy
dispersion, the translational motion of the bi-electron is coupled to its
internal motion. This results in effective masses dependent on quantum states
of the bi-electron. In the paper, properties of the bi-electron are illustrated

  polaritons from first principles",,,,,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A theoretical framework is presented for the computation of rovibrational
polaritonic states of a molecule in a lossless infrared (IR) microcavity. In
the proposed approach the quantum treatment of the rotational and vibrational
motion of the molecule can be formulated using arbitrary approximations. The
cavity-induced changes in electronic structure are treated perturbatively,
which allows using the existing polished tools of standard quantum chemistry
for determining electronic molecular properties. As a case study, the
rovibrational polaritons and related thermodynamic properties of H$_2$O in an
IR microcavity are computed for varying cavity parameters and applying various
approximations to describe the molecular degrees of freedom. The self-dipole
interaction is found to be significant for nearly all light-matter coupling
strengths investigated, and the molecular polarizability proved to be important
for the correct qualitative behavior of the energy level shifts induced by the
cavity. On the other hand, the magnitude of polarization remains small,
justifying the perturbative approach for the cavity-induced changes in
electronic structure. Comparing results obtained using a high-accuracy
variational molecular model with those obtained utilizing the rigid rotor and
harmonic oscillator approximations revealed that as long as the rovibrational
model is appropriate for describing the field-free molecule, the computed
rovibropolaritonic properties can be expected to be accurate as well. Strong
light-matter coupling between the radiation mode of an IR cavity and the
rovibrational states of H$_2$O lead to minor changes in the thermodynamic
properties of the system, and these changes seem to be dominated by
non-resonant interactions between the quantum light and matter.

variety of in and out of equilibrium systems with two-dimensional orientational
order. As they are associated with a nonzero circuitation condition, the
presence of defects induces a long-range perturbation of the orientation
landscape around them. The effective dynamics of defects is thus generally
described in terms of quasi-particles interacting through the orientation field
they produce, whose evolution in the simplest setting is governed by the
diffusion equation. Due to the multivalued nature of the orientation field, its
expression for a defect moving with an arbitrary trajectory cannot be obtained
straightforwardly and is often evaluated in the quasi-static approximation.
Here, we instead propose an approach that allows to derive the exact expression
for the orientation created by multiple moving defects, which we find to depend
on their past trajectories and thus to be nonlocal in time. Performing various
expansions in relevant regimes, we show how improved approximations with
respect to the quasi-static defect solution can be obtained. Moreover, our

To address this problem, we propose a novel data-dependent hashing method named

unfolded the optimization update for instance-wise data reconstruction, which
is better for preserving data information than data-independent LSH. Moreover,

  invariant multi-agent reinforcement learning is all you need","34 pages, 11 figures submitted to Physics of Fluids",,,,"physics.flu-dyn cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) is a recurrent phenomenon in several
industrial and geoscience flows and a well-studied system from a fundamental
fluid-mechanics viewpoint. However, controlling RBC, for example by modulating
the spatial distribution of the bottom-plate heating in the canonical RBC
configuration, remains a challenging topic for classical control-theory
methods. In the present work, we apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for
controlling RBC. We show that effective RBC control can be obtained by
leveraging invariant multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which takes
advantage of the locality and translational invariance inherent to RBC flows
inside wide channels. The MARL framework applied to RBC allows for an increase
in the number of control segments without encountering the curse of
dimensionality that would result from a naive increase in the DRL action-size
dimension. This is made possible by the MARL ability for re-using the knowledge
generated in different parts of the RBC domain. We show in a case study that
MARL DRL is able to discover an advanced control strategy that destabilizes the
spontaneous RBC double-cell pattern, changes the topology of RBC by coalescing
adjacent convection cells, and actively controls the resulting coalesced cell
to bring it to a new stable configuration. This modified flow configuration
results in reduced convective heat transfer, which is beneficial in several
industrial processes. Therefore, our work both shows the potential of MARL DRL
for controlling large RBC systems, as well as demonstrates the possibility for
DRL to discover strategies that move the RBC configuration between different
topological configurations, yielding desirable heat-transfer characteristics.
These results are useful for both gaining further understanding of the
intrinsic properties of RBC, as well as for developing industrial applications.

them depends on the fixed simulation budget, the ignorance of which could lead
to an inefficient allocation, especially when the simulation budget is finite.
In light of this, we develop a finite-budget allocation rule that is adaptive
to the simulation budget. Theoretical results show that the budget allocation
strategies are distinctively different between a finite budget and a
sufficiently large budget. Our proposed allocation rule can dynamically
determine the ratio of budget allocated to designs according to different

indicating it not only possesses desirable finite-budget properties but also

parameterizes all stabilizing controllers via linear constraints on closed-loop
response functions, known as system-level parameters. It was demonstrated that
several structural, locality, and communication constraints on the controller
can be posed as convex constraints on these system-level parameters. In the
current work, the identification problem is treated as a {\em dual} of the
system-level synthesis problem. The plant model is identified from the dual
system-level parameters associated to the plant. In comparison to existing
closed-loop identification approaches (such as the dual-Youla
parameterization), the D-SLP framework neither requires the knowledge of a
nominal plant that is stabilized by the known controller, nor depends upon the
choice of factorization of the nominal plant and the stabilizing controller.
Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed D-SLP method in
terms of identification errors, compared to existing closed-loop identification
techniques.

outcome. In a bid to tackle an infectious disease, a leader (government)
exploits such influence towards motivating a fraction of public to get
vaccinated, sufficient enough to ensure eradication. The leader also aims to
minimize the vaccinated fraction of public (that ensures eradication) and use
minimal incentives to motivate the influencers; it also controls
vaccine-supply-rates. Towards this, we consider a three-layered Stackelberg
game, with the leader at the top. A set of influencers at the middle layer are
involved in a stochastic vaccination game driven by incentives. The public at
the bottom layer is involved in an evolutionary game with respect to vaccine
responses.
  We prove the disease can always be eradicated once the public is sufficiently
sensitive towards the vaccination choices of the influencers -- with a minimal
fraction of public vaccinated. This minimal fraction depends only on the
disease characteristics and not on other aspects. Interestingly, there are many
configurations to achieve eradication, each configuration is specified by a
dynamic vaccine-supply-rate and a number -- this number represents the count of
the influencers that needs to be vaccinated to achieve the desired influence.
Incentive schemes are optimal when this number equals all or just one; the
former curbs free-riding among influencers while the latter minimizes the
dependency on influencers.

the quantum information. We establish a simple protocol for transferring one-

energetic cost of this protocol is calculated - in particular, the cost of
freezing and unfreezing tunnelling between quantum dots. Our results are
compared with the energetic cost of shuttling qubits in quantum dot arrays and
transferring classical information using classical information buses. Only our

of vehicle-to-anything (V2X) technologies, including vehicle-to-home (V2H),
vehicle-to-grid (V2G), and energy trading of EVs in the local grid. The EV
coordination can provide value to the grid and generate benefits for EVs.
However, network constraints and uncertainties in renewable energy and demand
pose significant challenges to EV coordination and restrict the realization of
these benefits. This paper develops a rolling-horizon optimization problem for
V2X value stacking to fully unlock the value of EV coordination, considering
power network constraints (such as voltage limits) and uncertainties in the
energy system. By coordinating EVs to perform V2H, V2G, and energy trading, our
approach exploits the most valuable services in real-time. We also analyze the
expected extra costs caused by the prediction errors to evaluate the impact of
uncertainties on V2X value stacking. We validate our value-stacking model using
real data from Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM), ISO New England

stacking achieves significant benefits to EVs through energy cost reduction.
The uncertainty in the load has a higher impact on the value-stacking
performance than PV generation, indicating the importance of load prediction.

Addressing an important open question on the legitimacy of such dynamic AutoRL

literature (DQN, PPO, and SAC) in different kinds of environments (Cartpole,
Bipedal Walker, and Hopper) This supports the theory that hyperparameters

according to their learning interactions with different exercises in online
learning systems (OIS), which is critical in supporting decision-making for
subsequent intelligent services, such as personalized learning source
recommendation. Existing researchers have broadly studied KT and developed many
effective methods. However, most of them assume that students' historical
interactions are uniformly distributed in a continuous sequence, ignoring the
fact that actual interaction sequences are organized based on a series of
quizzes with clear boundaries, where interactions within a quiz are
consecutively completed, but interactions across different quizzes are discrete
and may be spaced over days. In this paper, we present the Quiz-based Knowledge
Tracing (QKT) model to monitor students' knowledge states according to their
quiz-based learning interactions. Specifically, as students' interactions
within a quiz are continuous and have the same or similar knowledge concepts,
we design the adjacent gate followed by a global average pooling layer to
capture the intra-quiz short-term knowledge influence. Then, as various quizzes
tend to focus on different knowledge concepts, we respectively measure the
inter-quiz knowledge substitution by the gated recurrent unit and the
inter-quiz knowledge complementarity by the self-attentive encoder with a novel
recency-aware attention mechanism. Finally, we integrate the inter-quiz
long-term knowledge substitution and complementarity across different quizzes
to output students' evolving knowledge states. Extensive experimental results
on three public real-world datasets demonstrate that QKT achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Further analyses
confirm that QKT is promising in designing more effective quizzes.

of recovering the 3D structure of a scene from a series of projective
measurements that are calculated from a collection of 2D images, taken from
different perspectives. SfM consists of three main steps; feature detection and
matching, camera motion estimation, and recovery of 3D structure from estimated
intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and features.
  A problem encountered in SfM is that scenes lacking texture or with
repetitive features can cause erroneous feature matching between frames.
Semantic segmentation offers a route to validate and correct SfM models by
labelling pixels in the input images with the use of a deep convolutional
neural network. The semantic and geometric properties associated with classes
in the scene can be taken advantage of to apply prior constraints to each class
of object. The SfM pipeline COLMAP and semantic segmentation pipeline DeepLab
were used. This, along with planar reconstruction of the dense model, were used
to determine erroneous points that may be occluded from the calculated camera
position, given the semantic label, and thus prior constraint of the
reconstructed plane. Herein, semantic segmentation is integrated into SfM to
apply priors on the 3D point cloud, given the object detection in the 2D input
images. Additionally, the semantic labels of matched keypoints are compared and
inconsistent semantically labelled points discarded. Furthermore, semantic
labels on input images are used for the removal of objects associated with
motion in the output SfM models. The proposed approach is evaluated on a
data-set of 1102 images of a repetitive architecture scene. This project offers
a novel method for improved validation of 3D SfM models.

accretion power and the luminosity of the compact star. We investigate the
feedback process between the released accretion power and the X-ray luminosity
of the compact star in the unique high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-3. We assume
that a part of the wind-fed power experiences a small amplitude variability
around the source luminosity. We propose a simple heuristic model to couple the
influence of EUV irradiation on the stellar wind (from the Wolf-Rayet companion
star) with the X-ray source itself. The resulting time profile of luminosity
mimics that of the input variability, albeit with a larger amplitude. The most
important property of the input variability are turnover times when it changes
its sign and starts to have either positive or negative feedback. The
bolometric luminosity derived by spectral modeling is the time average of the
resulting feedback luminosity. We demonstrate that the erratic behavior of the
X-ray light curve of Cygnus X-3 may have its origin in the small amplitude
variability of the X-ray source and feedback with the companion wind. This
variability could arise in the accretion flow and/or due to the loss of kinetic
energy in a jet or an accretion disk wind. In order to produce similar
properties of the simulated light curve as observed, we have to restrict the
largest accretion radius to a changing level, and assume variable timescales
for the rise and decline phases of the light curve.

introduced for spatial scattering modulation (SSM) to overcome the limitation
in conventional SSM that the transmit antenna array steers the beam to a single
multipath (MP) component at each instance. In the proposed MCA-SSM system,
information bits are divided into two streams. One is mapped to an
amplitude-phase-modulation (APM) constellation symbol, and the other is mapped
to a beam vector symbol which steers multiple beams to selected strongest MP
components via an MCA matrix. In comparison with the conventional SSM system,
the proposed MCA-SSM enhances the bit error performance by avoiding both low
receiving power due to steering the beam to a single weak MP component and
inter-MP interference due to MP components with close values of angle of
arrival (AoA) or angle of departure (AoD). For the proposed MCA-SSM, a union
upper bound (UUB) on the average bit error probability (ABEP) with any MCA
matrix is analytically derived and validated via Monte Carlo simulations. Based
on the UUB, the MCA matrix is analytically optimized to minimize the ABEP of
the MCA-SSM. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out, which show that
the proposed MCA-SSM system remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art SSM
system in terms of ABEP under a typical indoor environment.

Flores subsets and WMT22 test sets suggest that translation instruction
improves the translation performance of vanilla LLMs significantly while
error-guided instruction can lead to a further improvement, which demonstrates
the importance of learning from low-quality translations annotated by human.

shock are completely determined by the incoming flows and the exit pressure.
The optimal regularity is obtained for all physical quantities, and the
velocity, the Bernoulls's function, the entropy and the pressure share the same
regularity. The problem is reduced to solve a nonlinear free boundary value
problem for a hyperbolic-elliptic mixed system. There are two main ingredients
in our analysis. One is to use the deformation-curl decomposition to the steady
Euler system introduced by the authors in \cite{wx19,w19} to effectively
decouple the hyperbolic and elliptic modes. Another one is the reformulation of
the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, which determines the shock front by an
algebraic equation and also gives an unusual second order differential boundary
conditions on the shock front for the deformation-curl system. After
homogenizing the curl system and introducing a potential function, the
solvability of the boundary value problem of the deformation-curl system for
the velocity field is reduced to a second order elliptic equation for the
potential function with a nonlocal term involving only the trace of the
potential function on the shock front. This simplification follows essentially
from an oblique boundary condition for the potential function on the shock
front which is obtained by solving the Poisson equation on the shock front with
the homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on the intersection of the shock
front and the cylinder walls.

attributes of the nonsingular terminal and integral sliding mode algorithms.
Secondly, an Adaptive Disturbance Observer (ADO) has been designed to alleviate
the effect of the uncertainty acting on the system. On application of the
ADO-based Full-Order Integral-Terminal Sliding Mode Control (FOITSMC), the
chattering phenomenon in control input has been reduced substantially in the
presence of conditionally known matched disturbances. Moreover, the adaptive
gains of ADO are updated non-monotonically without over-bounding the acting
disturbance, yet sustain the global boundedness of state trajectories within a
specific bound. %Finally, an application of the proposed algorithm for attitude
stabilization of a rigid spacecraft has been successively shown.

Thus, the most commonly employed architecture is the representation-focused

significant improvement in offline and online A/B testing performance.
Furthermore, we introduce a learnable feature selection scheme to optimize the

gravitational collapse of unstable neutron stars. We utilize the BL-Model to
describe the anisotropy inside the neutron star and construct a family of
anisotropic neutron stars for BSk21-EOS. We subject these stars to radial
perturbations to study their stability against radial oscillations, and analyze
the effects of anisotropy on the large frequency separation for systems with
and without crust. To observe the unstable branch in the respective profile
curves, we calculate the properties of anisotropic neutron stars in advance. We
compare the obtained radial stability curve to the standard criterion for
radial stability ($\frac{\partial M}{\partial \rho_c } > 0 $) and find that the
stability limit of anisotropic stars is more accurately described by the radial
stability curve. We filter out all sequence of anisotropic neutron stars that
exceed the stability limit obtained from the radial stability curve. The
ultimate fate of these unstable anisotropic neutron stars is to collapse into a
black hole. To study the dynamical evolution of such unstable anisotropic
neutron stars, we consider a non-ideal fluid in a non-adiabatic background. We
examine the time-evolution of key properties such as mass, density, heat flux,
and anisotropy during the process of gravitational collapse. To better
visualize this process, we perform a contour simulation (Fig.
\ref{fig:ns-params_time_evolution}). Finally, we introduce a few challenging

events.

efforts have been made to solve decentralized nonconvex strongly-concave (NCSC)
minimax-structured optimization; however, all of them focus on smooth problems
with at most a constraint on the maximization variable. In this paper, we make
the first attempt on solving composite NCSC minimax problems that can have
convex nonsmooth terms on both minimization and maximization variables. Our
algorithm is designed based on a novel reformulation of the decentralized
minimax problem that introduces a multiplier to absorb the dual consensus
constraint. The removal of dual consensus constraint enables the most
aggressive (i.e., local maximization instead of a gradient ascent step) dual
update that leads to the benefit of taking a larger primal stepsize and better
complexity results. In addition, the decoupling of the nonsmoothness and
consensus on the dual variable eases the analysis of a decentralized algorithm;
thus our reformulation creates a new way for interested researchers to design
new (and possibly more efficient) decentralized methods on solving NCSC minimax
problems. We show a global convergence result of the proposed algorithm and an
iteration complexity result to produce a (near) stationary point of the
reformulation. Moreover, a relation is established between the (near)
stationarities of the reformulation and the original formulation. With this
relation, we show that when the dual regularizer is smooth, our algorithm can
have lower complexity results (with reduced dependence on a condition number)
than existing ones to produce a near-stationary point of the original
formulation. Numerical experiments are conducted on a distributionally robust
logistic regression to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

the gradient clipping technique. We discuss the differences between these two
proposed algorithms as well as fine tune the parameters. Additionally, for the
objective functions satisfying the $r$-growth condition, a faster algorithm is
proposed using the restart technique. A particular attention is paid to the

Recent progress hinges upon sparse regression of observables using extensive

hidden non-observable control variables governing switching between different
dynamical regimes. Here we develop a data-efficient derivative-free method,
IHCV, for the Identification of Hidden Control Variables. First, the
performance and robustness of IHCV against noise are evaluated by benchmarking
the IHCV method using well-known bifurcation models (saddle-node,
transcritical, pitchfork, Hopf). Next, we demonstrate that IHCV discovers
hidden driver variables in the Lorenz, van der Pol, Hodgkin-Huxley, and
Fitzhugh-Nagumo models. Finally, IHCV generalizes to the case when only partial
observational is given, as demonstrated using the toggle switch model, the
genetic repressilator oscillator, and a Waddington landscape model. Our
proof-of-principle illustrates that utilizing normal forms could facilitate the
data-efficient and scalable discovery of hidden variables controlling
transitions between different dynamical regimes and non-linear models.

Two techniques are used to access the spin structure of this magnetic complex:
the resonant excitation of the excited states of X$^-$-Mn and the analysis of
the emission of a negatively charged biexciton in a magnetic dot (XX$^-$-Mn).
The photo-luminescence (PL) excitation of X$^-$-Mn reveals excited states with
a circularly polarized fine structure which strongly depends on the Mn spin
state S$_z$ and gives rise to negative circular polarization emission. This
fine structure arises from the coupling of the triplet states of an excited
charged exciton with the Mn (X$^{-*}$-Mn) and its S$_z$ dependence can be
described by a spin effective model. The recombination of XX$^-$-Mn leaves in
the dot a charged exciton in its excited state and the PL structure is
controlled by the coupling of triplet states of X$^{-*}$ with the Mn spin. An
analysis of the polarization and magneto-optic properties of this emission
gives access to the electron-hole exchange interaction within the triplets
states. Comparing the fine structure of the singlet X$^-$-Mn and of the

process, such as the fraction of stars that form in bound clusters (Gamma),
depend on the intensity of star formation activity (SigmaSFR) in the host
galaxy. The exact shape and strength of the predicted correlations, however,
vary from simulation to simulation. Observational results also remain unclear
at this time, because most works have mixed estimates made from very young
clusters for galaxies with higher SigmaSFR with those from older clusters for
galaxies with lower SigmaSFR. The three blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies
ESO185-IG13, ESO338-IG04, and Haro11 have played a central role on the
observational side because they have some of the highest known SigmaSFR and
published values of Gamma. We present new estimates of Gamma for these BCDs in
three age intervals (1-10 Myr, 10-100 Myr, 100-400 Myr), based on age-dating
which includes Halpha photometry to better discriminate between clusters
younger and older than ~10 Myr. We find significantly lower values for Gamma
(1-10 Myr) than published previously. The likely reason for the discrepancy is
that previous estimates appear to be based on age-reddening results that
underestimated ages and overestimated reddening for many clusters, artificially
boosting Gamma (1-10 Myr). We also find that fewer stars remain in clusters
over time, with ~15-39% in 1-10 Myr, ~5-7% in 10-100 Myr, and ~1-2% in 100-400
Myr clusters. We find no evidence that Gamma increases with SigmaSFR. These
results imply that cluster formation efficiency does not vary with star
formation intensity in the host galaxy. If confirmed, our results will help
guide future assumptions in galaxy-scale simulations of cluster formation and

find that log(C/O) for the entire sample at 12+log(O/H)<8.1 does not depend on
metallicity, with a small dispersion of ~0.13 dex around the average value of ~
-0.75 dex. On the other hand, the log(N/O) in galaxies at z>0.1, including LyC
leakers, is systematically higher compared to the rest of the sample with lower
metallicity. We find that log(C/O) slightly decreases with increasing Mstar
from ~ -0.65 at Mstar=10^6 Msun to ~ -0.80 at Mstar=10^9-10^10 Msun, whereas
log(N/O) is considerably enhanced at Mstar>10^8 Msun. The origin of these

that the upper mass limit of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in more
massive galaxies is higher. This would result in higher production of oxygen

interface leads to the axisymmetric collapse of the bubble cavity. We present
scaling laws for such a cavity collapse, established from experiments conducted
with bubbles spanning a wide range of Bond (${10^{-3}<Bo\leq1}$) and Ohnesorge
numbers (${10^{-3}<Oh<10^{-1}}$), defined with the bubble radius $R$. The
cavity collapse is a capillary-driven process, with a dependency on viscosity
and gravity affecting, respectively, precursory capillary waves on the cavity
boundary, and the static bubble shape. The collapse is characterised by
tangential and normal velocities of the kink, formed by the intersection of the
concave cavity opening after the top thin film rupture, with the convex bubble
cavity boundary. The tangential velocity $U_t$ is constant during the collapse
and is shown to be $U_t=4.5~U_c{\mathcal{W}}_R$, where $U_c$ is the capillary
velocity and ${\mathcal{W}}_R(Oh,Bo)={(1-\sqrt{Oh {\mathscr{L}}} )^{-1/2}}$ is
the wave resistance factor due to the precursory capillary waves, with
$\mathscr{L}(Bo)$ being the path correction of the kink motion. The movement of
the kink in the normal direction is part of the inward shrinkage of the whole
cavity due to the sudden reduction of gas pressure inside the bubble cavity
after the thin film rupture. This normal velocity is shown to scale as $U_c$ in
the equatorial plane, while at the bottom of the cavity
$\overline{U}_{nb}=U_c(Z_c/R)({\mathcal{W}_R}/ {\mathscr{L}})$, where $Z_c(Bo)$
is the static cavity depth. The total volume flux of cavity-filling, which is
entirely contributed by this shrinking, scales as ${Q_T\simeq 2\pi R Z_c U_c}$;
remains a constant throughout the collapse.

optical dephasing times of the third-order polarization observed in these

fluctuations. We investigate the excitation-induced dephasing (EID) and observe
a significant reduction of the contribution to the dephasing time with
increasing excitation density as compared to its lead counterpart
\ce{(PEA)2PbI4}, which we have previously reported
[A.~R.~Srimath~Kandada~\textit{et~al.}, J.\ Chem.\ Phys.\ \textbf{153}, 164706

orders of magnitude higher in \ce{(PEA)2SnI4} than that in \ce{(PEA)2PbI4}.
This increase in the EID rate may be due to exciton localization arising from a
more strongly statically disordered lattice in the tin derivative. This is
supported by the observation of multiple closely spaced exciton states and the
broadening of the linewidth with increasing population time (spectral
diffusion), which suggests a static disordered structure relative to the highly
dynamic lead-halide. Additionally, we find that the exciton nonlinear coherent
lineshape shows evidence of a biexcitonic state with low binding energy
($<10$\,meV) not observed in the lead system. We model the lineshapes based on
a stochastic scattering theory that accounts for the interaction with a
non-stationary population of dark background excitations. Our study provides
evidence of differences in the exciton quantum dynamics between tin- and
lead-based RPMHs and links them to the exciton-exciton interaction strength and
the static disorder aspect of the crystalline structure.

high-dimensional data because it is flexible and provides variable importance

we propose two novel approaches that focus on the mutual impact of features in
random forests. Mutual forest impact (MFI) is a relation parameter that
evaluates the mutual association of the featurs to the outcome and, hence, goes
beyond the analysis of correlation coefficients. Mutual impurity reduction
(MIR) is an importance measure that combines this relation parameter with the
importance of the individual features. MIR and MFI are implemented together
with testing procedures that generate p-values for the selection of related and
important features. Applications to various simulated data sets and the
comparison to other methods for feature selection and relation analysis show
that MFI and MIR are very promising to shed light on the complex relationships
between features and outcome. In addition, they are not affected by common
biases, e.g. that features with many possible splits or high minor allele

verbs. However, it is unclear whether this asymmetry is a result of complexity
in the visual structure of categories in the world to which language refers,
the structure of language itself, or the interplay between the two sources of
information. We quantitatively test these three hypotheses regarding early verb
learning by employing visual and linguistic representations of words sourced
from large-scale pre-trained artificial neural networks. Examining the
structure of both visual and linguistic embedding spaces, we find, first, that
the representation of verbs is generally more variable and less discriminable
within domain than the representation of nouns. Second, we find that if only
one learning instance per category is available, visual and linguistic
representations are less well aligned in the verb system than in the noun
system. However, in parallel with the course of human language development, if
multiple learning instances per category are available, visual and linguistic
representations become almost as well aligned in the verb system as in the noun
system. Third, we compare the relative contributions of factors that may
predict learning difficulty for individual words. A regression analysis reveals
that visual variability is the strongest factor that internally drives verb
learning, followed by visual-linguistic alignment and linguistic variability.
Based on these results, we conclude that verb acquisition is influenced by all
three sources of complexity, but that the variability of visual structure poses
the most significant challenge for verb learning.

(i.e., adversarially trained) models, with the twofold goal of i) establishing
which additional HPs are relevant to tune in adversarial settings, and ii)
reducing the cost of HPT for robust models. We pursue the first goal via an
extensive experimental study based on 3 recent models widely adopted in the
prior literature on adversarial robustness. Our findings show that the
complexity of the HPT problem, already notoriously expensive, is exacerbated in
adversarial settings due to two main reasons: i) the need of tuning additional
HPs which balance standard and adversarial training; ii) the need of tuning the
HPs of the standard and adversarial training phases independently. Fortunately,
we also identify new opportunities to reduce the cost of HPT for robust models.
Specifically, we propose to leverage cheap adversarial training methods to
obtain inexpensive, yet highly correlated, estimations of the quality
achievable using state-of-the-art methods (PGD). We show that, by exploiting
this novel idea in conjunction with a recent multi-fidelity optimizer (taKG),
the efficiency of the HPT process can be significantly enhanced.

  of Route Choice",,,,,"econ.TH cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As one of the most fundamental concepts in transportation science, Wardrop
equilibrium (WE) has always had a relatively weak behavioral underpinning. To
strengthen this foundation, one must reckon with bounded rationality in human
decision-making processes, such as the lack of accurate information, limited
computing power, and sub-optimal choices. This retreat from behavioral
perfectionism in the literature, however, was typically accompanied by a
conceptual modification of WE. Here we show that giving up perfect rationality
need not force a departure from WE. On the contrary, WE can be reached with
global stability in a routing game played by boundedly rational travelers. We
achieve this result by developing a day-to-day (DTD) dynamical model that
mimics how travelers gradually adjust their route valuations, hence choice
probabilities, based on past experiences. Our model, called cumulative logit
(CULO), resembles the classical DTD models but makes a crucial change: whereas
the classical models assume routes are valued based on the cost averaged over
historical data, ours values the routes based on the cost accumulated. To
describe route choice behaviors, the CULO model only uses two parameters, one
accounting for the rate at which the future route cost is discounted in the
valuation relative to the past ones and the other describing the sensitivity of
route choice probabilities to valuation differences. We prove that the CULO
model always converges to WE, regardless of the initial point, as long as the
behavioral parameters satisfy certain mild conditions. Our theory thus upholds
WE's role as a benchmark in transportation systems analysis. It also resolves
the theoretical challenge posed by Harsanyi's instability problem by explaining
why equally good routes at WE are selected with different probabilities.

with large positional disorder perturbation of the meta-atoms, the metasurfaces

supports internal gravity waves (IGWs). Excited at the boundary with the
convective core, IGWs propagate towards the stellar surface and are suspected
to impact physical processes such as rotation and chemical mixing. Using the
fully compressible time-implicit code MUSIC, we study IGWs in two-dimensional
simulations of a zero-age-main-sequence 5 solar mass star model up to 91\% of
the stellar radius with different luminosity and radiative diffusivity
enhancements. Our results show that low frequency waves excited by core
convection are strongly impacted by radiative effects as they propagate. This
impact depends on the radial profile of radiative diffusivity which increases
by almost 5 orders of magnitude between the centre of the star and the top of
the simulation domain. In the upper layers of the simulation domain, we observe
an increase of the temperature. Our study suggests that this is due to heat
added in these layers by IGWs damped by radiative diffusion. We show that
non-linear effects linked to large amplitude IGWs may be relevant just above
the convective core. Both these effects are intensified by the artificial
enhancement of the luminosity and radiative diffusivity, with enhancement
factors up to $10^4$ times the realistic values. Our results also highlight
that direct comparison between numerical simulations with enhanced luminosity
and observations must be made with caution. Finally, our work suggests that
thermal effects linked to the damping of IGWs could have a non-negligible
impact on stellar structure.

  channels",,,,,"cs.IT cs.DM math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reed-Muller codes were introduced in 1954, with a simple explicit
construction based on polynomial evaluations, and have long been conjectured to
achieve Shannon capacity on symmetric channels. Major progress was made towards
a proof over the last decades; using combinatorial weight enumerator bounds, a
breakthrough on the erasure channel from sharp thresholds, hypercontractivity
arguments, and polarization theory. Another major progress recently established
that the bit error probability vanishes slowly below capacity. However, when
channels allow for errors, the results of Bourgain-Kalai do not apply for
converting a vanishing bit to a vanishing block error probability, neither do
the known weight enumerator bounds. The conjecture that RM codes achieve
Shannon capacity on symmetric channels, with high probability of recovering the
codewords, has thus remained open.
  This paper closes the conjecture's proof. It uses a new recursive boosting
framework, which aggregates the decoding of codeword restrictions on
`subspace-sunflowers', handling their dependencies via an $L_p$ Boolean Fourier
analysis, and using a list-decoding argument with a weight enumerator bound
from Sberlo-Shpilka. The proof does not require a vanishing bit error
probability for the base case, but only a non-trivial probability, obtained
here for general symmetric codes. This gives in particular a shortened and
tightened argument for the vanishing bit error probability result of
Reeves-Pfister, and with prior works, it implies the strong wire-tap secrecy of
RM codes on pure-state classical-quantum channels.

Yet, electron doping of TMDs leads to the conversion of neutral excitons into
negative trions, which recombine predominantly non-radiatively at room
temperature. As a result, the photoluminescence (PL) intensity is quenched.
Here we study the optical and electronic properties of a MoS2/WSe2
heterostructure as a function of chemical doping by Cs atoms performed under
ultra-high vacuum conditions. By PL measurements we identify two interlayer
excitons and assign them to the momentum-indirect Q-Gamma and K-Gamma
transitions. The energies of these excitons are in a very good agreement with
ab initio calculations. We find that the Q-Gamma interlayer exciton is robust
to the electron doping and is present at room temperature even at a high charge
carrier concentration. Submicrometer angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(micro-ARPES) reveals charge transfer from deposited Cs adatoms to both the
upper MoS2 and the lower WSe2 monolayer without changing the band alignment.
This leads to a small (10 meV) energy shift of interlayer excitons. Robustness
of the momentum-indirect interlayer exciton to charge doping opens up an
opportunity of using TMD heterostructures in light-emitting devices that can

from vacuum energy. The Infinite Statistics model is also a parametric
extension of $\Lambda$CDM, where the dark energy is dynamic and originates from
the curvature of a dual space-time. We show that the data restricts the
additional parameters in these models to be consistent with their $\Lambda$CDM
values, and in particular that it implies that the theoretically predicted

results to the general discussion of the quantum/classical connection (which we
do not) but rather to slightly illuminate the specific case of axion
experiments. From the classical perspective one expects a signal oscillating
with a frequency equal to the axion mass whose amplitude is slowly rising due
to the tiny interaction of the axions with ordinary matter. In the quantum
picture the latter, slow time-scale arises from the small splitting in the
energy levels induced by the interaction between the axions and the experiment,
and it is always present in suitable, sensitive experiments. Signals that
oscillate with a frequency equal to the axion mass, however, arise from
processes changing the axion number. Yet, depending on the chosen observable,
such oscillations may be absent for certain special initial quantum states of
the axions. However, we show by example that, using an appropriate experimental
procedure, these special states can be modified by the experiment in such a way
that a signal oscillating with the axion mass re-appears. In addition, we
discuss the measurement of suitable correlators that feature an oscillation
with the axion mass. We also comment on the connection to the classical
treatment. The explicit experiment we look at is an oscillating EDM experiment
such as CASPEr but we expect our results to be easily adaptable to other types

nature and are thus prime candidates for nature-based computation. One
particular branch of this effort that has seen some recent rapid advances is
Ising machines. Some Ising machines are already showing better performance and
energy efficiency for optimization problems. Through design iterations and
co-evolution between hardware and algorithm, we expect more benefits from
nature-based computing systems. In this paper, we make a case for an augmented
Ising machine suitable for both training and inference using an energy-based
machine learning algorithm. We show that with a small change, the Ising
substrate accelerate key parts of the algorithm and achieve non-trivial speedup
and efficiency gain. With a more substantial change, we can turn the machine
into a self-sufficient gradient follower to virtually complete training
entirely in hardware. This can bring about 29x speedup and about 1000x
reduction in energy compared to a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) host.

introduce $q$-deformed Kogut-Susskind lattice gauge theories, obtained by
deforming the defining symmetry algebra to a quantum group. In contrast to
other formulations, our proposal simultaneously provides a controlled
regularization of the infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space while preserving
essential symmetry-related properties. This enables the development of both
quantum as well as quantum-inspired classical Spin Network Algorithms for
$q$-deformed gauge theories (SNAQs). To be explicit, we focus on SU(2)$_k$
gauge theories, that are controlled by the deformation parameter $k$ and
converge to the standard SU(2) Kogut-Susskind model as $k \rightarrow \infty$.
In particular, we demonstrate that this formulation is well suited for
efficient tensor network representations by variational ground-state
simulations in 2D, providing first evidence that the continuum limit can be
reached with $k = \mathcal{O}(10)$. Finally, we develop a scalable quantum
algorithm for Trotterized real-time evolution by analytically diagonalizing the
SU(2)$_k$ plaquette interactions. Our work gives a new perspective for the
application of tensor network methods to high-energy physics and paves the way

this challenging task through 3D modelling or generation using generative

for the face swapping task, which learns high-quality semantic-aware

normalizing for nuisance variations, such as image orientation or contrast
differences, via pre-processing. Statistical analysis is, in turn, conducted to
detect changes of interest, either at the individual or population level. This
classical approach can suffer from pre-processing issues and limitations of the

hard in settings where there are a lot of idiosyncratic changes. In this paper,
we present a simple machine learning-based approach that can alleviate these

learning of the score model from the inference sampling process, and, hence
allows for fast sampling strategies to generate goal-specified behavior in just
3 denoising steps, compared to 30+ steps of other diffusion based policies.
Furthermore, BESO is highly expressive and can effectively capture
multi-modality present in the solution space of the play data. Unlike previous
methods such as Latent Plans or C-Bet, BESO does not rely on complex
hierarchical policies or additional clustering for effective goal-conditioned
behavior learning. Finally, we show how BESO can even be used to learn a
goal-independent policy from play-data using classifier-free guidance. To the
best of our knowledge this is the first work that a) represents a behavior
policy based on such a decoupled SDM b) learns an SDM based policy in the

to result in approximately or exactly equal parameter updates to those under
backpropagation. Due to this connection, it has been suggested that PC can act
as an alternative to backpropagation with desirable properties that may
facilitate implementation in neuromorphic systems. Here, we explore these
claims using the different contemporary PC variants proposed in the literature.
We obtain time complexity bounds for these PC variants which we show are
lower-bounded by backpropagation. We also present key properties of these
variants that have implications for neurobiological plausibility and their
interpretations, particularly from the perspective of standard PC as a
variational Bayes algorithm for latent probabilistic models. Our findings shed
new light on the connection between the two learning frameworks and suggest
that, in its current forms, PC may have more limited potential as a direct
replacement of backpropagation than previously envisioned.

this problem we introduce the concept of constrained exploration with

ensure that the behavior of the agent meets the specification, and establish
(for a class of reinforcement-learning problems with a known deterministic

Using a path integral approach, we have obtained a stochastic equation

random fluctuations (noises) and the correction terms due to the generalized

Finally, we observe that the solution to the stochastic equation leads to time

gravitational wave (where the initial state is a squeezed state) both the noise
effect and the GUP effects exponentially enhance which may be possible to
detect in future generation of gravitational wave detectors. We have also given

across a group of neurons working together. A good model of these dynamics
should be able to infer the activity of unobserved neurons within the same
population and of the observed neurons at future times. Accordingly,
Pandarinath and colleagues have introduced a benchmark to evaluate models on
these two (and related) criteria: four data sets, each consisting of firing
rates from a population of neurons, recorded from macaque cortex during
movement-related tasks. Here we show that simple, general-purpose architectures
based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) outperform more ""bespoke"" models, and
indeed outperform all published models on all four data sets in the benchmark.
Performance can be improved further still with a novel, hybrid architecture
that augments the RNN with self-attention, as in transformer networks. But pure
transformer models fail to achieve this level of performance, either in our
work or that of other groups. We argue that the autoregressive bias imposed by
RNNs is critical for achieving the highest levels of performance. We conclude,
however, by proposing that the benchmark be augmented with an alternative
evaluation of latent dynamics that favors generative over discriminative models
like the ones we propose in this report.

where $C^\perp$ denotes the dual of $C$ under the Euclidean inner product. A
linear code with zero hull dimension is called a linear complementary dual
(LCD) code. A pair $(C, D)$ of linear codes of length $n$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$
is called a linear complementary pair (LCP) of codes if $C\oplus
D=\mathbb{F}_q^n$. In this paper, we give a characterization of LCD and LCP of
cyclic codes of length $q^m-1$, $m \geq 1$, over the finite field
$\mathbb{F}_q$ in terms of their basic dual zeros and their trace
representations. We also formulate the hull dimension of a cyclic code of
arbitrary length over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with respect to its basic dual zero.
Moreover, we provide a general formula for the dimension of the intersection of
two cyclic codes of arbitrary length over $\mathbb{F}_q$ based on their basic
dual zeros.

Galilei is contained in the biography of the scientist by Thomas Salusbury
dated ca. 1665, of which only one incomplete and inaccessible copy exists.
Galileo grew up in a Renaissance atmosphere, acquiring an artistic touch. He
was a musician, a writer and also a painter, as reported by Viviani and
documented by his watercolours of the Moon and drawings of solar spots.
Recently a new portrait with a remarkable similarity to the portraits of
Galileo Galilei by Santi di Tito (1601), Domenico Tintoretto (ca. 1604), and
Furini (ca. 1612) has been found and examined using sophisticated face
recognition techniques. If the identity could be confirmed, other elements,
such as the young age of Galileo or the seam in the canvas revealed by infrared
and X-ray analysis, may suggest a possible link with the self-portrait
mentioned by Salusbury.

"2304.14962","Doan Dai Nguyen","Doan Dai Nguyen","Polynomial-time parametric optimisation","Bachelor thesis",,,,"q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In biology, predicting RNA secondary structures plays a vital role in
determining its physical and chemical properties. Although we have powerful
energy models to predict them as well as parametric analysis to understand the
models themselves, the large number of parameters involved makes exploring the
parameter space and effective fine-tuning complicated at best. The literature
describes an approach via so-called RNA polytopes and several attempts to
compute them entirely, but computing explicitly the polytopes is both
practically and theoretically intractable. In this thesis, we demonstrate how
to further modify the dynamic programming algorithms used in RNA secondary
structure prediction, and more generally how to use only supporting functions
to gather some information about the polytopes without explicit construction.
We provide the mathematical frameworks with proofs or sketch thereof whenever
necessary, and carry out some numerical experiments to show that our proposed
methods are practical even when the number of parameters is large. As it turns
out, one of our methods provides a solution to another problem in computational
geometry previously unsolved to our knowledge, and we hope this thesis will
accommodate future studies in RNA, as well as inspire further researches on the
potential uses of polytopes' supporting functions in computational geometry.

  and a new algebraic attack on the stream cipher Trivium","27 pages",,,,"cs.SC cs.CR math.AC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper we introduce a multistep generalization of the
guess-and-determine or hybrid strategy for solving a system of multivariate
polynomial equations over a finite field. In particular, we propose performing
the exhaustive evaluation of a subset of variables stepwise, that is, by
incrementing the size of such subset each time that an evaluation leads to a
polynomial system which is possibly unfeasible to solve. The decision about
which evaluation to extend is based on a preprocessing consisting in computing
an incomplete Grobner basis after the current evaluation, which possibly
generates linear polynomials that are used to eliminate further variables. If
the number of remaining variables in the system is deemed still too high, the
evaluation is extended and the preprocessing is iterated. Otherwise, we solve
the system by a Grobner basis computation.
  Having in mind cryptanalytic applications, we present an implementation of
this strategy in an algorithm called MultiSolve which is designed for
polynomial systems having at most one solution. We prove explicit formulas for
its complexity which are based on probability distributions that can be easily
estimated by performing the proposed preprocessing on a testset of evaluations
for different subsets of variables. We prove that an optimal complexity of
MultiSolve is achieved by using a full multistep strategy with a maximum number
of steps and in turn the classical guess-and-determine strategy, which
essentially is a strategy consisting of a single step, is the worst choice.
Finally, we extensively study the behaviour of MultiSolve when performing an
algebraic attack on the well-known stream cipher Trivium.

records, often a large fraction of the values in laboratory tests and vital
signs are missing. The missingness can lead to biased estimates and limit our
ability to draw conclusions from the data. Additionally, many machine learning
algorithms can only be applied to complete datasets. A common solution is data
imputation, the process of filling-in the missing values. However, some of the
popular imputation approaches perform poorly on clinical data. We developed a
simple new approach, Time-Dependent Iterative imputation (TDI), which offers a
practical solution for imputing time-series data. It addresses both
multivariate and longitudinal data, by integrating forward-filling and
Iterative Imputer. The integration employs a patient, variable, and
observation-specific dynamic weighting strategy, based on the clinical patterns
of the data, including missing rates and measurement frequency. We tested TDI
on randomly masked clinical datasets. When applied to a cohort consisting of
more than 500,000 patient observations from MIMIC III, our approach
outperformed state-of-the-art imputation methods for 25 out of 30 clinical
variables, with an overall root-mean-squared-error of 0.63, compared to 0.85

systems that are captured by state space (SS) models. The need to fully
describe a SS model limits its applicability under complex settings, e.g., when
tracking based on visual data, and the processing of high-dimensional signals
often induces notable latency. These challenges can be treated by mapping the
measurements into latent features obeying some postulated closed-form SS model,
and applying the KF in the latent space. However, the validity of this
approximated SS model may constitute a limiting factor. In this work, we study
tracking from high-dimensional measurements under complex settings using a
hybrid model-based/data-driven approach. By gradually tackling the challenges
in handling the observations model and the task, we develop Latent-KalmanNet,
which implements tracking from high-dimensional measurements by leveraging data
to jointly learn the KF along with the latent space mapping. Latent-KalmanNet
combines a learned encoder with data-driven tracking in the latent space using
the recently proposed-KalmanNet, while identifying the ability of each of these
trainable modules to assist its counterpart via providing a suitable prior (by
KalmanNet) and by learning a latent representation that facilitates data-aided
tracking (by the encoder). Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed
Latent-KalmanNet achieves improved accuracy and run-time performance over both
model-based and data-driven techniques by learning a surrogate latent
representation that most facilitates tracking, while operating with limited
complexity and latency.

optimizing power grids. Over the past few decades, various statistical and deep
learning approaches have been used to develop load forecasting models. This
paper presents an interpretable machine learning approach that identifies load
dynamics using data-driven methods within an operator-theoretic framework. We
represent the load data using the Koopman operator, which is inherent to the
underlying dynamics. By computing the corresponding eigenfunctions, we
decompose the load dynamics into coherent spatiotemporal patterns that are the
most robust features of the dynamics. Each pattern evolves independently
according to its single frequency, making its predictability based on linear
dynamics. We emphasize that the load dynamics are constructed based on coherent
spatiotemporal patterns that are intrinsic to the dynamics and are capable of
encoding rich dynamical features at multiple time scales. These features are
related to complex interactions over interconnected power grids and different
exogenous effects. To implement the Koopman operator approach more efficiently,
we cluster the load data using a modern kernel-based clustering approach and
identify power stations with similar load patterns, particularly those with
synchronized dynamics. We evaluate our approach using a large-scale dataset
from a renewable electric power system within the continental European
electricity system and show that the Koopman-based approach outperforms a deep
learning (LSTM) architecture in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.

that, traditionally understood, describes asymptotic behavior of solutions
around an equilibrium point. This notion may be characterized abstractly as
continuity of a map associating to each point in a state-space the
corresponding integral curve with specified initial condition. Interpreting
stability as such permits a natural perspective of arbitrary trajectories as
stable, irrespective of whether they are stationary or even bounded, so long as
trajectories starting nearby stay nearby for all time.
  While methods exist for recognizing stability of equilibria points, such as
Lyapunov's first and second methods, such rely on the state's local property,
which may be readily computed or evaluated because solutions starting at
equilibria go nowhere. Such methods do not obviously extend for non-stationary
stable trajectories. After introducing a notion of stability which makes sense
for trajectories generally, we give examples confirming intuition and then
present a method for using knowledge of stability of one system to guarantee
stability of another, so long as there is an open map of dynamical systems from
the known stable system. We thus define maps of dynamical systems and prove
that a class of open maps preserve stability.

up air traffic controller (ATCo) training by integrating different
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) based tools. The virtual
simulation-pilot engine receives spoken communications from ATCo trainees, and
it performs automatic speech recognition and understanding. Thus, it goes
beyond only transcribing the communication and can also understand its meaning.
The output is subsequently sent to a response generator system, which resembles
the spoken read back that pilots give to the ATCo trainees. The overall
pipeline is composed of the following submodules: (i) automatic speech
recognition (ASR) system that transforms audio into a sequence of words; (ii)
high-level air traffic control (ATC) related entity parser that understands the
transcribed voice communication; and (iii) a text-to-speech submodule that
generates a spoken utterance that resembles a pilot based on the situation of
the dialogue. Our system employs state-of-the-art AI-based tools such as
Wav2Vec 2.0, Conformer, BERT and Tacotron models. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work fully based on open-source ATC resources and AI tools.
In addition, we have developed a robust and modular system with optional
submodules that can enhance the system's performance by incorporating real-time
surveillance data, metadata related to exercises (such as sectors or runways),
or even introducing a deliberate read-back error to train ATCo trainees to
identify them. Our ASR system can reach as low as 5.5% and 15.9% word error
rates (WER) on high and low-quality ATC audio. We also demonstrate that adding
surveillance data into the ASR can yield callsign detection accuracy of more
than 96%.

  Fluid Mechanics and Fluid Power (FMFP)",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The design of micro air vehicles (MAVs) introduces aerodynamic performance
challenges due to the small size and, consequently, the low Reynolds number
10000-100000. Natural fliers are naturally optimized and are comparable in size
to MAVs, making them a potent candidate to mimic for the design of MAVs. The
dragonfly frequently uses a gliding mode of flight relative to the other small
fliers and operates at a range of 100-10000. The literature suggests that the
corrugated profile improves the aerodynamic efficiency around Re at 104. It
allows us to investigate the aerodynamic advantages of tandem corrugated
airfoil inspired by the dragonfly wing. In this paper, we perform direct
numerical simulations of flow past bio-inspired corrugated wing to understand
the impact of the tandem wing configuration. The horizontal distance between
the wings is fixed, and the vertical distance varies. The results reveal that
the forewing/hindwing interaction increases the lift of the forewing relative
to the isolated wing for all the case studies. The combined drag coefficient
drops by approximately 7%, and overall efficiency drops by approximately 13%
relative to an isolated wing for a case study with zero vertical spacing
between forewing and hindwing at 3 degree angle of attack, fixed for both
wings. With no vertical gap, the aerodynamic efficiency matches close to the
isolated wing with the decrease in tandem wing combined drag coefficient
compared to an isolated wing.

formation and evolution models demonstrate that rocky exoplanets commonly
formed with hydrogen-rich envelopes that were lost over time. These findings
suggest that Earth may also have formed from bodies with H$_2$-rich primary
atmospheres. Here we use a self-consistent thermodynamic model to show that
Earth's water, core density, and overall oxidation state can all be sourced to
equilibrium between H$_2$-rich primary atmospheres and underlying magma oceans
in its progenitor planetary embryos. Water is produced from dry starting
materials resembling enstatite chondrites as oxygen from magma oceans reacts
with hydrogen. Hydrogen derived from the atmosphere enters the magma ocean and
eventually the metal core at equilibrium, causing metal density deficits
matching that of Earth. Oxidation of the silicate rocks from solar-like to
Earth-like oxygen fugacities also ensues as Si, along with H and O, alloys with
Fe in the cores. Reaction with hydrogen atmospheres and metal-silicate
equilibrium thus provides a simple explanation for fundamental features of
Earth's geochemistry that is consistent with rocky planet formation across the

Coupled with a conjugate prior, this results in a computationally simple model.
As opposed to more flexible specifications, our approach avoids overfitting, is
simple to implement and estimation is fast. The resulting cBVAR performs well

cBVARs improve point and density forecasts compared to standard BVARs, and lead
to milder but more persistent negative effects of uncertainty shocks on output.

partial resolution of this conjecture using a statistical mechanics approach.
First, the conjecture holds in full for the sticky particle model representing,
formally, infinitely strong local communication. In the classical case the
conjecture is proved when $N$, the number of agents, is equal to $2$. It
follows from a more general result stating that for a system of any size for
almost every data at least two agents align.
  The analysis is extended to the open space $\R^n$ in the presence of
confinement and potential interaction forces. In particular, it is shown that
almost every non-oscillatory pair of solutions aligns and aggregates in the

paper introduces the pre-trained large language model and prompt-learning to
the community of news recommendation. The proposed model ""prompt-based news
recommendation"" (PBNR) treats the personalized news recommendation as a
text-to-text language task and designs personalized prompts to adapt to the
pre-trained language model -- text-to-text transfer transformer (T5).
Experimental studies using the Microsoft News dataset show that PBNR is capable
of making accurate recommendations by taking into account various lengths of
past behaviors of different users. PBNR can also easily adapt to new
information without changing the model architecture and the training objective.
Additionally, PBNR can make recommendations based on users' specific
requirements, allowing human-computer interaction in the news recommendation
field.

  Regime Switching by Causation Entropy Boosting","34 pages, 9 figures",,,,"math.DS cs.LG nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Regime switching is ubiquitous in many complex dynamical systems with
multiscale features, chaotic behavior, and extreme events. In this paper, a
causation entropy boosting (CEBoosting) strategy is developed to facilitate the
detection of regime switching and the discovery of the dynamics associated with
the new regime via online model identification. The causation entropy, which
can be efficiently calculated, provides a logic value of each candidate
function in a pre-determined library. The reversal of one or a few such
causation entropy indicators associated with the model calibrated for the
current regime implies the detection of regime switching. Despite the short
length of each batch formed by the sequential data, the accumulated value of
causation entropy corresponding to a sequence of data batches leads to a robust
indicator. With the detected rectification of the model structure, the
subsequent parameter estimation becomes a quadratic optimization problem, which
is solved using closed analytic formulae. Using the Lorenz 96 model, it is
shown that the causation entropy indicator can be efficiently calculated, and
the method applies to moderately large dimensional systems. The CEBoosting
algorithm is also adaptive to the situation with partial observations. It is
shown via a stochastic parameterized model that the CEBoosting strategy can be
combined with data assimilation to identify regime switching triggered by the
unobserved latent processes. In addition, the CEBoosting method is applied to a
nonlinear paradigm model for topographic mean flow interaction, demonstrating
the online detection of regime switching in the presence of strong
intermittency and extreme events.

does not obey one of the assumptions that is required for modeling homogeneous

treatment planning for brain tumor patients. Segment anything (SA), a novel
promptable foundation model for autosegmentation, has shown high accuracy for
multiple segmentation tasks but was not evaluated on medical datasets yet.
Methods: SA was evaluated in a point-to-mask task for glioma brain tumor
autosegmentation on 16744 transversal slices from 369 MRI datasets (BraTS
2020). Up to 9 point prompts were placed per slice. Tumor core (enhancing tumor
+ necrotic core) was segmented on contrast-enhanced T1w sequences. Out of the 3
masks predicted by SA, accuracy was evaluated for the mask with the highest
calculated IoU (oracle mask) and with highest model predicted IoU (suggested
mask). In addition to assessing SA on whole MRI slices, SA was also evaluated
on images cropped to the tumor (max. 3D extent + 2 cm). Results: Mean best IoU
(mbIoU) using oracle mask on full MRI slices was 0.762 (IQR 0.713-0.917). Best
2D mask was achieved after a mean of 6.6 point prompts (IQR 5-9). Segmentation
accuracy was significantly better for high- compared to low-grade glioma cases
(mbIoU 0.789 vs. 0.668). Accuracy was worse using MRI slices cropped to the
tumor (mbIoU 0.759) and was much worse using suggested mask (full slices
0.572). For all experiments, accuracy was low on peripheral slices with few
tumor voxels (mbIoU, <300: 0.537 vs. >=300: 0.841). Stacking best oracle
segmentations from full axial MRI slices, mean 3D DSC for tumor core was 0.872,
which was improved to 0.919 by combining axial, sagittal and coronal masks.
Conclusions: The Segment Anything foundation model, while trained on photos,
can achieve high zero-shot accuracy for glioma brain tumor segmentation on MRI
slices. The results suggest that Segment Anything can accelerate and facilitate
RT treatment planning, when properly integrated in a clinical application.

computational bottlenecks if modeled rigorously, or to solution inaccuracies in

suitable for analyzing arbitrary and non-linear microstructures exist, their
computational cost makes them impractical to use in large-scale structural
analysis. Surrogate models or Reduced Order Models (ROM), commonly enhance
efficiencies, but they are typically calibrated with a single microstructure.
Homogenization methods, such as the Mori-Tanaka method, offer rapid
homogenization for a wide range of constituent properties. However, simplifying
assumptions, like stress and strain averaging in phases, render the
consideration of both deterministic and stochastic variations in microstructure
infeasible.
  This paper illustrates a transformer neural network architecture that
captures the knowledge of various microstructures and constituents, enabling it
to function as a computationally efficient homogenization surrogate model.
Given an image or an abstraction of an arbitrary composite microstructure, the
transformer network predicts the homogenized stress-strain response. Two
methods were tested that encode features of the microstructure. The first
method calculates two-point statistics of the microstructure and uses Principal
Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction. The second method uses an

methods accurately predict the homogenized material response. The paper

subjective and difficult to pinpoint through short-term surveys and psychiatric

systems, along with the phase-out of fossil-based power stations, necessitate
procuring more flexibility from the demand sectors. The electrification of the
residential heat sector is an option to decarbonise the heat sector in the
United Kingdom. The inherent flexibility that is available in the residential
heat sector, in the form of the thermal inertia of buildings, is expected to
play an important role in supporting the critical task of short-term balancing
of electricity supply and demand. This paper proposes a method for
characterising the locally aggregated flexibility envelope from the electrified
residential heat sector, considering the most influential factors including
outdoor and indoor temperature, thermal mass and heat loss of dwellings.
Applying the method to England and Wales as a case study, demonstrated a
significant potential for a temporary reduction of electricity demand for
heating even during cold weather. Total electricity demand reductions of
approximately 25 GW to 85 GW were shown to be achievable for the outdoor
temperature of 10 degreeC and -5 degreeC, respectively. Improving the energy
performance of the housing stock in England and Wales was shown to reduce the
magnitude of available flexibility to approximately 18 GW to 60 GW for the
outdoor temperature of 10 degreeC and -5 degreeC, respectively. This is due to
the use of smaller size heat pumps in the more efficient housing stock.
However, the impact of the buildings' retrofit on their thermal mass and
consequently on the duration of the flexibility provision is uncertain.

were absent or newly show up. In this paper, we propose FedBasis, a novel PFL
framework to tackle such a deficiency. FedBasis learns a set of few, shareable
``basis'' models, which can be linearly combined to form personalized models
for clients. Specifically for a new client, only a small set of combination
coefficients, not the models, needs to be learned. This notion makes FedBasis
more parameter-efficient, robust, and accurate compared to other competitive
PFL baselines, especially in the low data regime, without increasing the
inference cost. To demonstrate its applicability, we also present a more
practical PFL testbed for image classification, featuring larger data
discrepancies across clients in both the image and label spaces as well as more
faithful training and test splits.

is one of the most challenging to address. This is because leakage, i.e., the
loss of information stored in the computational subspace to undesired subspaces
in a larger Hilbert space, is more difficult to detect and correct than errors
that preserve the computational subspace. As a result, leakage presents a
significant obstacle to the development of fault-tolerant quantum computation.
In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate benchmarking framework
called leakage randomized benchmarking (LRB) for measuring leakage rates on
multi-qubit quantum systems. Our approach is more insensitive to state
preparation and measurement (SPAM) noise than existing leakage benchmarking
protocols, requires fewer assumptions about the gate set itself, and can be
used to benchmark multi-qubit leakages, which was not done previously. We also
extend the LRB protocol to an interleaved variant called interleaved LRB
(iLRB), which can benchmark the average leakage rate of generic n-site quantum
gates with reasonable noise assumptions. We demonstrate the iLRB protocol on
benchmarking generic two-qubit gates realized using flux tuning, and analyze
the behavior of iLRB under corresponding leakage models. Our numerical
experiments show good agreement with theoretical estimations, indicating the
feasibility of both the LRB and iLRB protocols.

counter parts proposed in the original Gibbons' conjecture.
  To overcome the difficulties in proving the Gibbons' conjecture and the
impediments caused by the strong correlation between space and time of fully
fractional heat operator $(\partial_t-\Delta)^s$, we introduce some new ideas
and provide several new insights. More precisely, we first derive a weighted
average inequality, which not only provides a straightforward proof for the
maximum principle in bounded domains, but also plays a crucial role in further
deducing the maximum principle in unbounded domains. Such average inequality
and maximum principles are essential ingredients to carry out the sliding
method, and then we apply this direct method to prove the Gibbons' conjecture

  It is important to note that the holistic approach developed in this paper is
highly versatile, and will become useful tools in investigating various

performance in detecting context-based anomalies where the abnormality is

propose a novel approach inspired by the loss function of DeepSVDD. Instead of
mapping all normal instances into a single hypersphere center, each normal

superfluidity in such bilayer systems is often modelled by solving a mean-field
gap equation defined for only the conduction and valence band of the electron
and hole material respectively. A key quantity entering the gap equation is the
effective Coulomb potential acting as the bare interaction in the subspace of
the model. Since the model only includes a few bands around the Fermi energy
the effective model interaction is partially screened. Although the screening
is a material dependent quantity it has in previous works been accounted for in
an ad hoc manner, by assuming a static dielectric constant of 2 for a wide
range of different materials. In this work we show that the effective model
interaction can be derived from first principles using open source code
frameworks. Using this novel ab initio downfolding procedure we show that the
material dependent screening is essential to predict both magnitude and trends

aqueous polyethylene oxide (PEO) solutions which partially wet polydimethyl
siloxane (PDMS) substrates. Under certain conditions the retreating film
generates regularly-spaced liquid filaments. The early-stage thin-film dynamics
of dewetting are investigated to identify a theoretical criterion for liquid
filament formation. Starting with a linear stability analysis of a Newtonian or
simple non-Newtonian (power-law) thin-film, a critical film thickness is
identified which depends on the Hamaker constant for the fluid-substrate pair
and the surface tension of the fluid. When the measured film thickness is
smaller than this value, the film is unstable and forms filaments as a result
of van der Waals forces dominating its behaviour. This critical film-height is
compared with experimental measurements of film thickness obtained for receding
films of Newtonian (glycerol-water mixtures) and non-Newtonian (PEO) solutions
generated on substrates inclined at angles 0 $^{\circ}$, 30 $^{\circ}$, and 60
$^{\circ}$ to the vertical. The observations of filament and its absence show
good agreement with the theory. The evolution of the thin-film shape is
modelled numerically to show that the formation of filaments arises because the

breaks the four-fold symmetry present in the I4/mmm crystal structure, thus
declassifying these systems as square-net magnets.

orientational dynamics of the glass-forming, thioether-linked cyanobiphenyl
liquid crystal dimers. As was expected theoretically, two different relaxation
processes that contributed to the dielectric permittivity of dimers were
observed. The low-frequency relaxation mode, m1, was attributed to an
end-over-end rotation of the dipolar groups parallel to the director. The
high-frequency relaxation mode, m2, was associated with the precessional
motions of the dipolar groups around the director. The relaxation times for
both modes were analyzed over a wide temperature range down to near the glass
transition temperature. The different analytic functions used to characterize
the temperature dependence of the relaxation times of the two modes are
discussed. Notably, the critical-like description via the dynamic scaling model
gave good numerical fittings and a consistent physical picture of the
orientational dynamics on approaching the glass transition. Compared to the IR
spectroscopy finding, in the higher temperature region of the twist-bend phase,
where the longitudinal correlations of dipoles grew, the m1 mode experienced a
sudden increase in enthalpy. At the same time, m2 changed continuously, which
is described by the critical mode coupling behavior. Both types of molecular
motion appear to strongly cooperate at a low-temperature range of the
twist-bend phase but change in a coordinated manner as the temperature of the
material approaches the glass transition point. As was expected, it was found
that both molecular motions determined the glass dynamics at the same glass
transition temperature.

high flexibility (in terms of user mobility) compared to remote rendering
through a wired connection, and (2) the high computing power available on the
server compared to local rendering (on HMD). The requirements to facilitate a
pleasant XR experience are analyzed in three aspects: capacity (throughput),
latency, and reliability. For capacity, two VR experiences are analyzed: a
human eye-like experience and an experience with the Oculus Quest 2 HMD. For
latency, the key components of the motion-to-photon (MTP) delay are discussed.
For reliability, the maximum packet loss rate (or the minimum packet delivery
rate) is studied for different XR scenarios. Specifically, the paper reviews
optimization techniques that were proposed to reduce the latency, conserve the
bandwidth, extend the scalability, and/or increase the reliability to satisfy
the stringent requirements of the emerging XR applications.

sparsity problem. Content-based CDR is one of the most promising branches since
most kinds of products can be described by a piece of text, especially when
cold-start users or items have few interactions. However, two vital issues are
still under-explored: (1) From the content modeling perspective, sufficient
long-text descriptions are usually scarce in a real recommender system, more
often the light-weight textual features, such as a few keywords or tags, are
more accessible, which is improperly modeled by existing methods. (2) From the
CDR perspective, not all inter-domain interests are helpful to infer
intra-domain interests. Caused by domain-specific features, there are part of
signals benefiting for recommendation in the source domain but harmful for that
in the target domain. Therefore, how to distill useful interests is crucial. To
tackle the above two problems, we propose a metapath and multi-interest
aggregated graph neural network (M2GNN). Specifically, to model the tag-based
contents, we construct a heterogeneous information network to hold the semantic
relatedness between users, items, and tags in all domains. The metapath schema
is predefined according to domain-specific knowledge, with one metapath for one
domain. User representations are learned by GNN with a hierarchical aggregation
framework, where the intra-metapath aggregation firstly filters out trivial
tags and the inter-metapath aggregation further filters out useless interests.
Offline experiments and online A/B tests demonstrate that M2GNN achieves
significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods and current
industrial recommender system in Dianping, respectively. Further analysis shows
that M2GNN offers an interpretable recommendation.

popularity. However, the design of the reward function, on which the agent
relies to optimize its recommendation policy, is often not straightforward.
Exploring the causality underlying users' behavior can take the place of the
reward function in guiding the agent to capture the dynamic interests of users.
Moreover, due to the typical limitations of simulation environments (e.g., data
inefficiency), most of the work cannot be broadly applied in large-scale
situations. Although some works attempt to convert the offline dataset into a
simulator, data inefficiency makes the learning process even slower. Because of
the nature of reinforcement learning (i.e., learning by interaction), it cannot
collect enough data to train during a single interaction. Furthermore,
traditional reinforcement learning algorithms do not have a solid capability
like supervised learning methods to learn from offline datasets directly. In
this paper, we propose a new model named the causal decision transformer for
recommender systems (CDT4Rec). CDT4Rec is an offline reinforcement learning
system that can learn from a dataset rather than from online interaction.
Moreover, CDT4Rec employs the transformer architecture, which is capable of
processing large offline datasets and capturing both short-term and long-term
dependencies within the data to estimate the causal relationship between
action, state, and reward. To demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of

levitation of the molecules in a very weak optical dipole trap. With the
trapped molecules we finally reach a high phase-space density of about 0.1. We
measure the magnetic field dependence of the molecular binding energy and the
magnetic moment, refining our knowledge of the resonance parameters. We also
demonstrate a peculiar anisotropic expansion effect observed when the molecules
are released from the trap and expand freely in the magnetic levitation field.
Moreover, we identify an important lifetime limitation that is imposed by the
1064-nm infrared trap light itself and not by inelastic collisions. The
light-induced decay rate is found to be proportional to the trap light
intensity and the closed-channel fraction of the Feshbach molecule. These
observations suggest a one-photon coupling to electronically excited states to
limit the lifetime and point to the prospect of loss suppression by optimizing

estimate of privacy parameter into a formal guarantee. The EVR paradigm first
estimates the privacy parameter of a mechanism, then verifies whether it meets

randomized privacy verifier using Monte Carlo (MC) technique. Furthermore, we

the newly proposed EVR paradigm improves the utility-privacy tradeoff for

overall PIM accelerator efficiency is limited by energy-intensive

reduce ADC cost do so by changing DNN weights or by using low-resolution ADCs
that reduce output fidelity. These strategies harm DNN accuracy and/or require
costly DNN retraining to compensate.
  To address these issues, we propose the RAELLA architecture. RAELLA adapts
the architecture to each DNN; it lowers the resolution of computed analog
values by encoding weights to produce near-zero analog values, adaptively
slicing weights for each DNN layer, and dynamically slicing inputs through
speculation and recovery. Low-resolution analog values allow RAELLA to both use
efficient low-resolution ADCs and maintain accuracy without retraining, all
while computing with fewer ADC converts.
  Compared to other low-accuracy-loss PIM accelerators, RAELLA increases energy
efficiency by up to 4.9$\times$ and throughput by up to 3.3$\times$. Compared
to PIM accelerators that cause accuracy loss and retrain DNNs to recover,

threshold signature that is a hybrid of privacy and accountability. It enables
a combiner to combine t signature shares while revealing nothing about the
threshold t or signing quorum to the public and asks a tracer to track a
signature to the quorum that generates it. However, TAPS has three
disadvantages: it 1) structures upon a centralized model, 2) assumes that both
combiner and tracer are honest, and 3) leaves the tracing unnotarized and
static. In this work, we introduce Decentralized, Threshold, dynamically
Accountable and Private Signature (DeTAPS) that provides decentralized
combining and tracing, enhanced privacy against untrusted combiners (tracers),

design non-interactive zero knowledge proofs to achieve public verifiability of

we formalize the definitions and security requirements for DeTAPS. Then we

Both the CCRB and the LU-CCRB require differentiability of the likelihood

local bounds that are inappropriate for predicting the threshold phenomena of
the constrained maximum likelihood (CML) estimator. The constrained
Barankin-type bound (CBTB) is a nonlocal mean-squared-error (MSE) lower bound
for constrained parameter estimation that does not require differentiability of
the likelihood function. However, this bound requires a restrictive
mean-unbiasedness condition in the constrained set. In this work, we propose
the Lehmann-unbiased CBTB (LU-CBTB) on the weighted MSE. This bound does not
require differentiability of the likelihood function and assumes
Lehmann-unbiasedness, which is less restrictive than the CBTB
mean-unbiasedness. We show that the LU-CBTB is tighter than or equal to the
LU-CCRB and coincides with the CBTB for linear constraints. For nonlinear
constraints the LU-CBTB and the CBTB are different and the LU-CBTB can be a
lower bound on the WMSE of constrained estimators in cases, where the CBTB is

is not differentiable and constrained Cramer-Rao-type bounds do not exist,

Eventually, conversational search systems should be trained, evaluated, and

natural language generation model. But rather than merely reporting this new
state-of-the-art, we present an in-depth investigation of the task of
simulating user response for conversational search. Our goal is to supplement
existing works with an insightful hand-analysis of what challenges are still
unsolved by the advanced model, as well as to propose our solutions for them.
The challenges we identified include (1) dataset noise, (2) a blind spot that
is difficult for existing models to learn, and (3) a specific type of
misevaluation in the standard empirical setup. Except for the dataset noise
issue, we propose solutions to cover the training blind spot and to avoid the
misevaluation. Our proposed solutions lead to further improvements. Our best
system improves the previous state-of-the-art significantly.

primarily use term-based statistical features and do not generally model

of modeling resource-query and resource-resource relationships. Specifically,
we utilize a pre-trained language model (PTLM) to obtain semantic information

preserve structural information of query-resource relationships and employ GNN
to extract structural information. In addition, the heterogeneous graph is
enriched with resource-resource type of edges to further enhance the ranking

domain adaptation setting where the feature space differs between source and

methods assume that both positive and negative examples are available in the
source domain, which may not be satisfied in some real applications. This paper
addresses a new challenging setting called positive and unlabeled heterogeneous
domain adaptation (PU-HDA), a HUDA setting where the source domain only has
positives. PU-HDA can also be viewed as an extension of PU learning where the
positive and unlabeled examples are sampled from different domains. A naive
combination of existing HUDA and PU learning methods is ineffective in PU-HDA
due to the gap in label distribution between the source and target domains. To
overcome this issue, we propose a novel method, positive-adversarial domain
adaptation (PADA), which can predict likely positive examples from the
unlabeled target data and simultaneously align the feature spaces to reduce the
distribution divergence between the whole source data and the likely positive
target data. PADA achieves this by a unified adversarial training framework for
learning a classifier to predict positive examples and a feature transformer to
transform the target feature space to that of the source. Specifically, they
are both trained to fool a common discriminator that determines whether the
likely positive examples are from the target or source domain. We
experimentally show that PADA outperforms several baseline methods, such as the
naive combination of HUDA and PU learning.

free finite element methods), and the stability and error estimate are
rigorously proven. With proper parameters, this method converges much faster
than the Uzawa method. Second, numerical simulations show that with rather
relaxed stopping criteria which require only a few iterations each time step,
the numerical solution preserves stability and accuracy for high Reynolds
numbers, where the convectional projection method would fail. Furthermore, this
method retains the efficiency of the traditional projection method by
decoupling the velocity and pressure fields, which splits the saddle point
system into small elliptic problems. Three dimensional simulations with
Taylor-Hood P2/P1 finite elements are presented to demonstrate the performance
and efficiency of this method.
  More importantly, this method is a generic approach and thus there are many
potential improvements and extensions of the iterative projection method,
including utilization of various convection forms, association with
stabilization techniques for high Reynolds numbers, applications to other
saddle point problems.

  Structural Knowledge Transfer","13 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Recently, omnidirectional images (ODIs) have become increasingly popular;
however, their angular resolution tends to be lower than that of perspective
images.This leads to degraded structural details such as edges, causing
difficulty in learning 3D scene understanding tasks, especially monocular depth
estimation. Existing methods typically leverage high-resolution (HR) ODI as the
input, so as to recover the structural details via fully-supervised learning.
However, the HR depth ground truth (GT) maps may be arduous or expensive to be
collected due to resource-constrained devices in practice. Therefore, in this
paper, we explore for the first time to estimate the HR omnidirectional depth
directly from a low-resolution (LR) ODI, when no HR depth GT map is available.
Our key idea is to transfer the scene structural knowledge from the readily
available HR image modality and the corresponding LR depth maps to achieve the
goal of HR depth estimation without extra inference cost. Specifically, we
introduce ODI super-resolution (SR) as an auxiliary task and train both tasks
collaboratively in a weakly supervised manner to boost the performance of HR
depth estimation. The ODI SR task takes an LR ODI as the input to predict an HR
image, enabling us to extract the scene structural knowledge via uncertainty
estimation. Buttressed by this, a scene structural knowledge transfer (SSKT)
module is proposed with two key components. First, we employ a cylindrical
implicit interpolation function (CIIF) to learn cylindrical neural
interpolation weights for feature up-sampling and share the parameters of CIIFs
between the two tasks. Then, we propose a feature distillation (FD) loss that
provides extra structural regularization to help the HR depth estimation task
learn more scene structural knowledge.

to almost all network architectures. Specifically, the tensors of parameters
are maintained in the frequency domain, where high frequency components can be
eliminated by zigzag setting tensor elements to zero. Then, the inverse
discrete cosine transform (IDCT) is used to reconstruct the spatial tensors for
matrix operations during network training. Since high frequency components of

generating temporal boundaries for actions of interest, meanwhile the action
category should also be classified. Pseudo-label-based methods, which serve as
an effective solution, have been widely studied recently. However, existing
methods generate pseudo labels during training and make predictions during
testing under different pipelines or settings, resulting in a gap between
training and testing. In this paper, we propose to generate high-quality pseudo
labels from the predicted action boundaries. Nevertheless, we note that
existing post-processing, like NMS, would lead to information loss, which is
insufficient to generate high-quality action boundaries. More importantly,
transforming action boundaries into pseudo labels is quite challenging, since
the predicted action instances are generally overlapped and have different
confidence scores. Besides, the generated pseudo-labels can be fluctuating and
inaccurate at the early stage of training. It might repeatedly strengthen the
false predictions if there is no mechanism to conduct self-correction. To
tackle these issues, we come up with an effective pipeline for learning better
pseudo labels. Firstly, we propose a Gaussian weighted fusion module to
preserve information of action instances and obtain high-quality action
boundaries. Second, we formulate the pseudo-label generation as an optimization
problem under the constraints in terms of the confidence scores of action
instances. Finally, we introduce the idea of $\Delta$ pseudo labels, which
enables the model with the ability of self-correction. Our method achieves
superior performance to existing methods on two benchmarks, THUMOS14 and

challenge, we adopt the perturb-all-frame strategy to construct perturbation
spaces consistent with those in multi-frame attacks. However, the
perturb-all-frame strategy causes a precision issue in linear relaxations. To
address this issue, we introduce a novel abstract domain called InterZono and
design tighter relaxations. We prove that InterZono is more precise than

clients do not have the same interests in the global model as the server.
However, due to system heterogeneity and limited budget, it is generally
impractical for the server to incentivize all clients to participate in all
training rounds (known as full participation). The existing FL incentive
mechanisms are typically designed by stimulating a fixed subset of clients
based on their data quantity or system resources. Hence, FL is performed only
using this subset of clients throughout the entire training process, leading to
a biased model because of data heterogeneity. This paper proposes a game
theoretic incentive mechanism for FL with randomized client participation,
where the server adopts a customized pricing strategy that motivates different
clients to join with different participation levels (probabilities) for
obtaining an unbiased and high performance model. Each client responds to the
server's monetary incentive by choosing its best participation level, to
maximize its profit based on not only the incurred local cost but also its
intrinsic value for the global model. To effectively evaluate clients'
contribution to the model performance, we derive a new convergence bound which
analytically predicts how clients' arbitrary participation levels and their
heterogeneous data affect the model performance. By solving a non-convex
optimization problem, our analysis reveals that the intrinsic value leads to
the interesting possibility of bidirectional payment between the server and
clients. Experimental results using real datasets on a hardware prototype
demonstrate the superiority of our mechanism in achieving higher model
performance for the server as well as higher profits for the clients.

courses themselves have time conflicts, and the students have credit caps (an
upper bound on the number of courses they would like to enroll in). We model
this problem as follows. We have $n$ agents (students), and there are
""resources"" (these correspond to courses). Each agent is only interested in a
subset of the resources (courses of interest), and each resource can only be
assigned to a bounded number of agents (available seats). In addition, each
resource corresponds to an interval of time, and the objective is to assign
non-overlapping resources to agents so as to produce ""fair and high utility""
schedules.
  In this model, we provide a number of results under various settings and
objective functions. Specifically, in this paper, we consider the following
objective functions: total utility, max-min (Santa Claus objective), and
envy-freeness. The total utility objective function maximizes the sum of the
utilities of all courses assigned to students. The max-min objective maximizes
the minimum utility obtained by any student. Finally, envy-freeness ensures
that no student envies another student's allocation. Under these settings and
objective functions, we show a number of theoretical results. Specifically, we
show that the course allocation under [...]

costs may lead to significant uplift payments. However, when fixed costs are
included, prices become non-monotonic with respect to demand, which can
adversely impact market transparency. To overcome this issue, convex hull (CH)
pricing has been introduced for unit commitment with fixed costs. Several CH
pricing methods have been presented, and a feasible cost has been used as a
quality measure for the CH price. However, obtaining a feasible cost requires a
computationally intensive optimization procedure, and the associated duality

approach for quantifying the quality of the CH price by establishing an upper
bound on the optimal dual value. The proposed approach uses Surrogate
Lagrangian Relaxation (SLR) to efficiently obtain near-optimal CH prices, while
the upper bound decreases rapidly due to the convergence of SLR. Testing
results on the IEEE 118-bus system demonstrate that the novel quality measure
is more accurate than the measure provided by a feasible cost, indicating the
high quality of the upper bound and the efficiency of SLR.

spontaneously get adsorbed on the particle surface. The azo-dendrimer molecules
in the presence of external UV irradiation undergo conformational change

The defect transformation can be emulated in colloidal assemblies towards

number $r(G_1, G_2)$ is the minimum number $n$ such that the complete graph
$K_n\longmapsto(G_1, G_2)$. In [Discrete Math. 312(2012)], Schelp formulated
the following question: for which graphs $H$ there is a constant $0<c<1$ such
that for any graph $G$ of order at least $r(H, H)$ with $\delta(G)>c|V(G)|$,
$G\longmapsto(H, H)$. In this paper, we prove that for any $m>n$, if $G$ is a
balanced bipartite graph of order $2(m+n-1)$ with
$\delta(G)>\frac{3}{4}(m+n-1)$, then $G\longmapsto(CM_m, CM_n)$, where $CM_i$
is a matching with $i$ edges contained in a connected component. By
Szem\'{e}redi's Regularity Lemma, using a similar idea as introduced by [J.
Combin. Theory Ser. B 75(1999)], we show that for every $\eta>0$, there is an
integer $N_0>0$ such that for any $N>N_0$ the following holds: Let
$\alpha_1>\alpha_2>0$ such that $\alpha_1+\alpha_2=1$. Let $G[X, Y]$ be a
balanced bipartite graph on $2(N-1)$ vertices with
$\delta(G)\geq(\frac{3}{4}+3\eta)(N-1)$. Then for each red-blue-edge-coloring
of $G$, either there exist red even cycles of each length in $\{4, 6, 8,
\ldots, (2-3\eta^2)\alpha_1N\}$, or there exist blue even cycles of each length
in $\{4, 6, 8, \ldots, (2-3\eta^2)\alpha_2N\}$. Furthermore, the bound
$\delta(G)\geq(\frac{3}{4}+3\eta)(N-1)$ is asymptotically tight. Previous
studies on Schelp's question on cycles are on diagonal case, we obtain an

of the most important contributions of this paper is to show that if $A,

q^d$ for almost every $g\in O(d)$. In the flavor of expanding functions, with
$|A|\le |B|$, we also show that the image $A-gB$ grows exponentially. In two
dimensions, the result simply says that if $|A|=q^x$ and $|B|=q^y$, as long as
$0<x\le y<2$, then for almost every $g\in O(2)$, we can always find
$\epsilon=\epsilon(x, y)>0$ such that $|A-gB|\gg |B|^{1+\epsilon}$. To prove

while the high order $L2$-$1_\sigma$ scheme is taken into account to discretize

used to approximate the spatial derivatives to solve the one-dimensional

images (e.g., ImageNet images) for pretraining, learning features that
invariant to geometric transformation. However, when images are not
object-centric, the semantics of the image can be significantly altered due to
cropping. Furthermore, as the model becomes insensitive to geometric
transformations, it may struggle to capture location information. For this
reason, we propose a Geometric Transformation Sensitive Architecture designed
to be sensitive to geometric transformations, specifically focusing on
four-fold rotation, random crop, and multi-crop. Our method encourages the
student to be sensitive by predicting rotation and using targets that vary with
those transformations through pooling and rotating the teacher feature map.
Additionally, we use patch correspondence loss to encourage correspondence
between patches with similar features. This approach allows us to capture
long-term dependencies in a more appropriate way than capturing long-term
dependencies by encouraging local-to-global correspondence, which occurs when
learning to be insensitive to multi-crop. Our approach demonstrates improved
performance when using non-object-centric images as pretraining data compared

the specific correlation between {\Delta}{\tau} and Vr can depend on the

we develop a new privacy-preserving average consensus method for unbalanced

randomness in mixing weights to confuse communications and introducing an extra
auxiliary parameter to mask the state-updated rule in initial several
iterations. In parallel, we exploit the intrinsic robustness of consensus

Theoretical results demonstrate that the designed algorithms can converge

stack of tomorrow's intervention-assisting systems in endoscopic surgeries. For
this, tracking the endoscope pose is a key component, but remains challenging
due to illumination conditions, deforming tissues and the breathing motion of
organs. Method: We propose a solution for stereo endoscopes that estimates
depth and optical flow to minimize two geometric losses for camera pose
estimation. Most importantly, we introduce two learned adaptive per-pixel
weight mappings that balance contributions according to the input image
content. To do so, we train a Deep Declarative Network to take advantage of the
expressiveness of deep-learning and the robustness of a novel geometric-based
optimization approach. We validate our approach on the publicly available
SCARED dataset and introduce a new in-vivo dataset, StereoMIS, which includes a
wider spectrum of typically observed surgical settings. Results: Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on average and more importantly, in
difficult scenarios where tissue deformations and breathing motion are visible.
We observed that our proposed weight mappings attenuate the contribution of
pixels on ambiguous regions of the images, such as deforming tissues.
Conclusion: We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution to robustly
estimate the camera pose in challenging endoscopic surgical scenes. Our
contributions can be used to improve related tasks like simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM) or 3D reconstruction, therefore advancing
surgical scene understanding in minimally-invasive surgery.

easily segment moving objects without knowing what they are. The Gestalt law of
common fate, i.e., what move at the same speed belong together, has inspired
unsupervised object discovery based on motion segmentation. However, common
fate is not a reliable indicator of objectness: Parts of an articulated /
deformable object may not move at the same speed, whereas shadows / reflections
of an object always move with it but are not part of it.
  Our insight is to bootstrap objectness by first learning image features from
relaxed common fate and then refining them based on visual appearance grouping
within the image itself and across images statistically. Specifically, we learn
an image segmenter first in the loop of approximating optical flow with
constant segment flow plus small within-segment residual flow, and then by
refining it for more coherent appearance and statistical figure-ground
relevance.
  On unsupervised video object segmentation, using only ResNet and
convolutional heads, our model surpasses the state-of-the-art by absolute gains

paper proposes an intelligent system based on machine learning that
personalizes lighting in the instant future location of a recognized user,
inferred by trajectory prediction. Our proposed system consists of the
following modules: (I) human detection to detect and localize the person in
each given video frame, (II) face recognition to identify the detected person,
(III) human tracking to track the person in the sequence of video frames and
(IV) trajectory prediction to forecast the future location of the user in the
environment using Inverse Reinforcement Learning. The proposed method provides
a unique profile for each person, including specifications, face images, and
custom lighting settings. This profile is used in the lighting adjustment
process. Unlike other methods that consider constant lighting for every person,
our system can apply each 'person's desired lighting in terms of color and
light intensity without direct user intervention. Therefore, the lighting is
adjusted with higher speed and better efficiency. In addition, the predicted
trajectory path makes the proposed system apply the desired lighting, creating
more pleasant and comfortable conditions for the home residents. In the
experimental results, the system applied the desired lighting in an average
time of 1.4 seconds from the moment of entry, as well as a performance of
22.1mAp in human detection, 95.12% accuracy in face recognition, 93.3% MDP in

attracts increasing interest recently. However, it often encounters the problem
of missing modality data and thus suffers severe performance degradation in
practice. To this end, we propose a general framework called MMANet to assist
incomplete multimodal learning. It consists of three components: the deployment
network used for inference, the teacher network transferring comprehensive
multimodal information to the deployment network, and the regularization
network guiding the deployment network to balance weak modality combinations.
Specifically, we propose a novel margin-aware distillation (MAD) to assist the
information transfer by weighing the sample contribution with the
classification uncertainty. This encourages the deployment network to focus on
the samples near decision boundaries and acquire the refined inter-class
margin. Besides, we design a modality-aware regularization (MAR) algorithm to
mine the weak modality combinations and guide the regularization network to
calculate prediction loss for them. This forces the deployment network to
improve its representation ability for the weak modality combinations
adaptively. Finally, extensive experiments on multimodal classification and
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our MMANet outperforms the state-of-the-art

holes in the bumblebee theory was constructed. In this paper, we investigate
the associated local thermodynamic properties. By introducing a pair of
conjugated thermodynamic quantities $X$ and $Y$, which can be interpreted as an
extension of electric potential and charge of the Reissner Nordstr\""om black
holes, we numerically construct a new first law of thermodynamics for bumblebee
black holes. We then study the constant-$Y$ processes in the entropy-charge

capacity to study the local thermodynamic stability of the bumblebee black
holes. For a negative nonminimal coupling coefficient $\xi$, we find both
divergent and smooth phase transitions. For a positive but small $\xi$, only a
divergent phase transition is found. It turns out that there is a critical
value $0.4\kappa <\xi_c < 0.5\kappa$ such that when $\xi_c < \xi<2\kappa$, even
the divergent phase transition disappears and the bumblebee black holes thus
become locally thermodynamically unstable regardless of the bumblebee charge.
As for $\xi>2\kappa$, the smooth phase transition arises again but there no

of the primordial elemental abundances in the big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN).
The Standard BBN is a parameter-free theory due to the precise knowledge of the
baryon-to-photon ratio of the Universe obtained from studies of the
anisotropies of cosmic microwave background radiation. Although the computed
abundances of light elements during primordial nucleosynthesis and those
determined from observations are in good agreement throughout a range of nine
orders of magnitude, there is still a disparity of $^7$Li abundance
overestimated by a factor of $\sim 2.5$ when calculated theoretically. The
number of light neutrino flavors, the neutron lifetime and the baryon-to-photon
ratio in addition to the astrophysical nuclear reaction rates determine the
primordial abundances. We previously looked into the impact of updating
baryon-to-photon ratio and neutron lifetime and changing quite a few reaction
rates on the yields of light element abundances in BBN. In this work,
calculations are performed using new reaction rates for
$^3$H(p,$\gamma$)$^4$He, $^6$Li(p,$\gamma$)$^7$Be, $^7$Be(p,$\gamma$)$^8$B,

behaviours can be accurately predicted via their associated state evolution
equations. Orthogonal AMP (OAMP) was recently developed to avoid the need for
computing the so-called Onsager term in traditional AMP algorithms, providing
two clear benefits: the derivation of an OAMP algorithm is both straightforward
and more broadly applicable. OAMP was originally demonstrated for statistical
problems with a single measurement vector and single transform. This paper
extends OAMP to statistical problems with multiple measurement vectors (MMVs)
and multiple transforms (MTs). We name the resulting algorithms as OAMP-MMV and
OAMP-MT respectively, and their combination as augmented OAMP (A-OAMP). Whereas
the extension of traditional AMP algorithms to such problems would be
challenging, the orthogonal principle underpinning OAMP makes these extensions
straightforward.
  The MMV and MT models are widely applicable to signal processing and
communications. We present an example of MIMO relay system with correlated
source data and signal clipping, which can be modelled as a joint MMV-MT
system. While existing methods meet with difficulties in this example, OAMP
offers an efficient solution with excellent performance.

collected and reduced for six AGNs with a suspected QPO. The Gaussian process
(GP) model celerite was used to fit the light curves and to search for the
quasi-periodicity behavior. The power spectral density and parameter posterior
distributions of each light curve were calculated with the optimal model. Of
the six AGNs, only RE J1034+396 was found to have a QPO of about 3600 s. The
other five sources do not show QPO modulation behavior. We propose that a hot
spot on the accretion disk is a possible physical mechanism resulting in this
quasi-periodic behavior of AGNs.

coalescences by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector networks has enabled us to infer
the underlying distribution of compact binaries across a wide range of masses,
spins, and redshifts. In light of the new features found in the mass spectrum
of binary black holes and the uncertainty regarding binary formation models,
non-parametric population inference has become increasingly popular. In this
work, we develop a data-driven clustering framework that can identify features
in the component mass distribution of compact binaries simultaneously with
those in the corresponding redshift distribution, from gravitational wave data
in the presence of significant measurement uncertainties, while making very few
assumptions on the functional form of these distributions. Our generalized
model is capable of inferring correlations among various population properties
such as the redshift evolution of the shape of the mass distribution itself, in
contrast to most existing non-parametric inference schemes. We test our model
on simulated data and demonstrate the accuracy with which it can re-construct
the underlying distributions of component masses and redshifts. We also
re-analyze public LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data from events in GWTC-3 using our model
and compare our results with those from some alternative parametric and
non-parametric population inference approaches. Finally, we investigate the
potential presence of correlations between mass and redshift in the population
of binary black holes in GWTC-3 (those observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA
detector network in their first 3 observing runs), without making any
assumptions about the specific nature of these correlations.

climate to economic impacts and form the basis for most of estimates of the
social cost of carbon. Implicit in these functions lies an unwarranted
assumption that restricts the spatial variation (Svar) and temporal variability
(Tvar) of changes in climate to be null. This could bias damage estimates and
the climate policy advice from IAMs. While the effects of Tvar have been
studied in the literature, those of Svar and their interactions with Tvar have
not. Here we present estimates of the economic costs of climate change that
account for both Tvar and Svar, as well as for the seasonality of damages
across sectors. Contrary to the results of recent studies which show little
effect that of Tvar on expected losses, we reveal that ignoring Svar produces
large downward biases, as warming is highly heterogeneous over space. Using a
conservative calibration for the damage function, we show that previous
estimates are biased downwards by about 23-36%, which represents additional
losses of about US$1,400-US$2,300 billion by 2050 and US$17-US$28 trillion by
the end of the century, under a high emissions scenario. The present value of
losses during the period 2020-2100 would be larger than reported in previous
studies by $47-$66 trillion or about 1/2 to 3/4 of annual global GDP in 2020.
Our results imply that using global mean temperature change in IAMs as a
summary measure of warming is not adequate for estimating the costs of climate
change. Instead, IAMs should include a more complete description of climate

a large amount of reverberant data. During the training of the systems,
on-the-fly simulation pipeline is nowadays preferred as it allows the model to
train on infinite number of data samples without pre-generating and saving them
on harddisk. An RIR simulation method thus needs to not only generate more
realistic artificial room impulse response (RIR) filters, but also generate
them in a fast way to accelerate the training process. Existing RIR simulation
tools have proven effective in a wide range of speech processing tasks and
neural network architectures, but their usage in on-the-fly simulation pipeline
remains questionable due to their computational complexity or the quality of
the generated RIR filters. In this paper, we propose FRAM-RIR, a fast random
approximation method of the widely-used image-source method (ISM), to
efficiently generate realistic multi-channel RIR filters. FRAM-RIR bypasses the
explicit calculation of sound propagation paths in ISM-based algorithms by
randomly sampling the location and number of reflections of each virtual sound
source based on several heuristic assumptions, while still maintains accurate
direction-of-arrival (DOA) information of all sound sources. Visualization of
oracle beampatterns and directional features shows that FRAM-RIR can generate
more realistic RIR filters than existing widely-used ISM-based tools, and
experiment results on multi-channel noisy speech separation and dereverberation
tasks with a wide range of neural network architectures show that models
trained with FRAM-RIR can also achieve on par or better performance on real
RIRs compared to other RIR simulation tools with a significantly accelerated

However, data pre-processing, including strategies for handling missing data,
remains a major bottleneck in real-world federated learning deployment, and is
typically performed locally. This approach may be biased, since the
subpopulations locally observed at each center may not be representative of the
overall one. To address this issue, this paper first proposes a more consistent
approach to data standardization through a federated model. Additionally, we
propose Fed-MIWAE, a federated version of the state-of-the-art imputation
method MIWAE, a deep latent variable model for missing data imputation based on
variational autoencoders. MIWAE has the great advantage of being easily
trainable with classical federated aggregators. Furthermore, it is able to deal
with MAR (Missing At Random) data, a more challenging missing-data mechanism
than MCAR (Missing Completely At Random), where the missingness of a variable
can depend on the observed ones. We evaluate our method on multi-modal medical
imaging data and clinical scores from a simulated federated scenario with the
ADNI dataset. We compare Fed-MIWAE with respect to classical imputation
methods, either performed locally or in a centralized fashion. Fed-MIWAE allows
to achieve imputation accuracy comparable with the best centralized method,
even when local data distributions are highly heterogeneous. In addition,
thanks to the variational nature of Fed-MIWAE, our method is designed to
perform multiple imputation, allowing for the quantification of the imputation

  Accordingly, considerable ranking metrics have been developed and
learning-to-rank algorithms that have been designed to optimize these simple
performance metrics have been widely used in modern IR systems.
  As applications evolve, however, people's need for information retrieval have
shifted from simply retrieving relevant documents to more advanced information
services that satisfy their complex working and entertainment needs.
  Thus, more complicated and user-centric objectives such as user satisfaction
and engagement have been adopted to evaluate modern IR systems today.
  Those objectives, unfortunately, are difficult to be optimized under existing

discover new equations diagnosing cloud cover from coarse-grained variables of
global storm-resolving model simulations. These analytical equations are
interpretable by construction and easily transferable to other grids or climate

performance comparable to that of neural networks ($R^2=0.94$) while remaining
simple (with only 13 trainable parameters). It reproduces cloud cover
distributions more accurately than the Xu-Randall scheme across all cloud
regimes (Hellinger distances $<0.09$), and matches neural networks in
condensate-rich regimes. When applied and fine-tuned to the ERA5 reanalysis,
the equation exhibits superior transferability to new data compared to all

identify explicit parallels in the benefits of overparameterisation between
what has been analysed in the deep learning context and system identification.
We test multiple chaotic time series models, analysing the optimisation process
for unknown model states and parameters in batch mode. We find that gradient
descent reaches better solutions if we assume more parameters to be unknown. We
hypothesise that, indeed, overparameterisation leads us towards better minima,
and that more degrees of freedom in the optimisation are beneficial so long as
the system is, in principle, observable.

facilitates the practical application of real-time object detectors. Our
RT-DETR-L achieves 53.0% AP on COCO val2017 and 114 FPS on T4 GPU, while

human tissue and is crucial for clinical diagnosis. However, limited by cost,
noise and manual labeling, obtaining diverse and reliable multimodal MR images
remains a challenge. For the same lesion, different MRI manifestations have
great differences in background information, coarse positioning and fine
structure. In order to obtain better generation and segmentation performance, a
coordination-spatial attention generation adversarial network (CASP-GAN) based
on the cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) is proposed.
The performance of the generator is optimized by introducing the Coordinate
Attention (CA) module and the Spatial Attention (SA) module. The two modules
can make full use of the captured location information, accurately locating the
interested region, and enhancing the generator model network structure. The
ability to extract the structure information and the detailed information of
the original medical image can help generate the desired image with higher
quality. There exist some problems in the original CycleGAN that the training
time is long, the parameter amount is too large, and it is difficult to
converge. In response to this problem, we introduce the Coordinate Attention
(CA) module to replace the Res Block to reduce the number of parameters, and
cooperate with the spatial information extraction network above to strengthen
the information extraction ability. On the basis of CASP-GAN, an attentional
generative cross-modality segmentation (AGCMS) method is further proposed. This
method inputs the modalities generated by CASP-GAN and the real modalities into
the segmentation network for brain tumor segmentation. Experimental results

facial components while maintaining others unchanged. This drives us to not

segmentation. In this paper, we propose a collaborative feature learning
approach to simultaneously detect manipulation and segment the falsified

each other efficiently. To enable our study of forgery detection and
segmentation, we build a facial forgery dataset consisting of both entire and

Experiment results have justified the mutual promotion between forgery
detection and manipulated region segmentation. The overall performance of the
proposed approach is better than the state-of-the-art detection or segmentation
approaches. The visualization results have shown that our proposed model always
captures the artifacts on facial regions, which is more reasonable.

analyzing electronic specific heat (ESH). Depending on the hopping of
electrons, two different kinds of helical systems are considered. In one case
the hopping is confined within a few neighboring lattice sites which is
referred to as short-range hopping (SRH) helix, while in the other case,
electrons can hop in all possible sites making the system a long-range hopping
(LRH) one. The interplay between helicity and the electric field is quite
significant. Our detailed study shows that, in the low-temperature limit, the
SRH helix is more sensitive to temperature than its counterpart. Whereas, the
situation gets reversed in the limit of high temperatures. The thermal response
of the helix can be modified selectively by means of the electric field, and
the difference between specific heats of the two helices gradually decreases
with increasing the field strength. The molecular handedness (viz, left-handed
or right-handed) rather has no appreciable effect on the thermal signature.
Finally, one important usefulness of ESH is discussed. If the helix contains a
point defect, then by comparing the results of perfect and defective helices,
one can estimate the location of the defect, which might be useful in
diagnosing bad cells and different diseases.

question has been the subject of much recent debate. The standard approach is a
log-rank test and/or a Cox proportional hazards model. Alternative methods have
been explored in the statistical literature, such as weighted log-rank tests
and tests based on the Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST). While weighted
log-rank tests can achieve high power compared to the standard log-rank test,
some choices of weights may lead to type-I error inflation under particular
conditions. In addition, they are not linked to an unambiguous estimand.
Arguably, therefore, they are difficult to intepret. Test statistics based on
the RMST, on the other hand, allow one to investigate the average difference
between two survival curves up to a pre-specified time point $\tau$ -- an
unambiguous estimand. However, by emphasizing differences prior to $\tau$, such
test statistics may not fully capture the benefit of a new treatment in terms
of long-term survival. In this article, we introduce a graphical approach for
direct comparison of weighted log-rank tests and tests based on the RMST. This
new perspective allows a more informed choice of the analysis method, going

B-type spectra with 9000 < Teff < 24000K and -5.2< MG < 1.5 mag. The accuracy

spectra to those with same stellar parameters selected from the known spectral

wavelength between the predicted spectra and the corresponding ones in MILES

magnitudes calculated from the integration of the predicted spectra and the
observations in PS1 and APASS bands with the same stellar parameters. No
significant systematic difference is found between the predicted spectra and
the photomatric observations. The uncertainty is 0.08mag in r band for SSF-gM
when comparing with the stars with the same stellar parameters selected from
PS1. And the uncertainty becomes 0.31mag in i band for SSF-dM when comparing
with the stars with the same stellar parameters selected from APASS.

only when required, helping the patient go fast enough to maintain balance (or
preventing him from going too fast). Experimental results are reported. They

treatment planning often have high computational requirements regarding time

presented to address the aforementioned issue by combining Monte Carlo dose
calculation and optimization into a single algorithm and omitting the
calculation of the time-consuming and costly dose influence matrix. Methods:
The beamlet-free algorithm simulates the dose in proton batches of randomly
chosen spots and evaluates their relative impact on the objective function at
each iteration. Based on the approximated gradient, the spot weights are then
updated and used to generate a new spot probability distribution. The
beamlet-free method is compared against a conventional, beamlet-based treatment
planning algorithm on a brain case. Results: The beamlet-free algorithm
maintained a comparable plan quality while reducing the computation time by 70%
and the peak memory usage by 95%. Conclusion: The implementation of a

challenging to adapt to production lines with speed demands. To address this
challenge, we present a multi-view object detection framework that offers a
fast and precise solution. We introduce a novel multi-view dataset with
semi-automatic ground-truth data, which results in significant labeling
resource savings. Labeling PCB boards for object detection is a challenging
task due to the high density of components and the small size of the objects,
which makes it difficult to identify and label them accurately. By training an
object detector model with multi-view data, we achieve improved performance
over single-view images. To further enhance the accuracy, we develop a
multi-view inference method that aggregates results from different viewpoints.
Our experiments demonstrate a 15% improvement in mAP for detecting components
that range in size from 0.5 to 27.0 mm.

relationships between human and objects, plays an important role in scene
understanding. Although two-stage HOI detectors have advantages of high
efficiency in training and inference, they suffer from lower performance than
one-stage methods due to the old backbone networks and the lack of
considerations for the HOI perception process of humans in the interaction
classifiers. In this paper, we propose Vision Transformer based
Pose-Conditioned Self-Loop Graph (ViPLO) to resolve these problems. First, we
propose a novel feature extraction method suitable for the Vision Transformer
backbone, called masking with overlapped area (MOA) module. The MOA module
utilizes the overlapped area between each patch and the given region in the
attention function, which addresses the quantization problem when using the
Vision Transformer backbone. In addition, we design a graph with a
pose-conditioned self-loop structure, which updates the human node encoding
with local features of human joints. This allows the classifier to focus on
specific human joints to effectively identify the type of interaction, which is
motivated by the human perception process for HOI. As a result, ViPLO achieves
the state-of-the-art results on two public benchmarks, especially obtaining a
+2.07 mAP performance gain on the HICO-DET dataset. The source codes are

call DAS-N2N, for suppressing strong random noise in distributed acoustic
sensing (DAS) recordings. DAS-N2N requires no manually produced labels (i.e.,
pre-determined examples of clean event signals or sections of noise) for
training and aims to map random noise processes to a chosen summary statistic,
such as the distribution mean, median or mode, whilst retaining the true
underlying signal. This is achieved by splicing (joining together) two fibres
hosted within a single optical cable, recording two noisy copies of the same
underlying signal corrupted by different independent realizations of random
observational noise. A deep learning model can then be trained using only these
two noisy copies of the data to produce a near fully-denoised copy. Once the
model is trained, only noisy data from a single fibre is required. Using a
dataset from a DAS array deployed on the surface of the Rutford Ice Stream in
Antarctica, we demonstrate that DAS-N2N greatly suppresses incoherent noise and
enhances the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of natural microseismic icequake
events. We further show that this approach is inherently more efficient and
effective than standard stop/pass band filtering routines and a comparable
self-supervised learning method based on masking individual DAS channels. Our
preferred model for this task is lightweight, processing 30 seconds of data
recorded at a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz over 985 channels (approx. 1 km of
fiber) in $<$1 s. Due to the high noise levels in DAS recordings, efficient
data-driven denoising methods, such as DAS-N2N, will prove essential to
time-critical DAS earthquake detection, particularly in the case of

the total luminosities of CO and [O I] toward Gy 3-7 with values found for low-

aim to identify the possible effects of metallicity on the FIR line cooling

FIR lines. The spatial extent of CO high-J (J>14) emission resembles that of
the elongated 160 um continuum emission detected with Herschel. The CO
transitions from J=14-13 to J=16-15 are detected throughout the cluster and
show a median rotational temperature of 170+/-30 K on Boltzmann diagrams.
Comparisons to other protostars observed with Herschel show a good agreement
with intermediate-mass sources in the inner Galaxy. Assuming an origin of the

delay time distribution (DTD) of neutron star mergers (NSMs). We construct a
sample of model galaxies that fulfils the observed galaxy stellar mass
function, star formation rate versus mass relation, and the cosmic star
formation rate density. The star formation history of galaxies is described
with a log-normal function characterised by two parameters: the position of the
maximum and the width of the distribution. We assume a theoretical DTD that
mainly depends on the lower limit and the slope of the distribution of the
separations of the binary neutron stars systems at birth. We find that the
current rate of NSMs ($\mathcal{R}=320^{+490}_{-240}$ Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$)
requires that $\sim0.3$ per cent of neutron star progenitors lives in binary
systems with the right characteristics to lead to a NSM within a Hubble time.
We explore the expected relations between the rate of NSMs and the properties
of the host galaxy. We find that the most effective proxy for the shape of the
DTD of NSMs is the current star formation activity of the typical host. At
present, the fraction of short-GRBs observed in star-forming galaxies favours
DTDs with at least $\sim40\%$ of mergers within $100$ Myr. This conclusion will
be put on a stronger basis with larger samples of short-GRBs with host

sensing context to either improve localization performance or to extend the
coverage in non-line-of-sight scenarios. While most of the literature considers
RISs as statically placed in the environment, the usage of target-lodged RISs
is relatively new and could be of interest where the target's reflectivity
can/must be increased to improve its detection or parameters' estimation. This
letter derives the Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) on the estimation of position and
orientation (\textit{pose}) of a target-mounted RIS, in generic conditions:
near-field, bistatic and wideband operation (i.e., when the wavefront across
the RIS is curved and the employed sensing bandwidth is large enough to obtain
a frequency-dependent RIS behavior). In particular, we focus on the wideband
effect, that implies a \textit{pose-dependent filtering} on the impinging
signal decreasing or increasing the CRB depending on the RIS size and the
employed signal bandwidth.

  shocks",,,"10.1093/mnras/stad1356",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the acceleration of charged particles by ultra-relativistic shocks
using test-particle Monte-Carlo simulations. Two field configurations are
considered: (i) shocks with uniform upstream magnetic field in the plane of the
shock, and (ii) shocks in which the upstream magnetic field has a cylindrical
geometry. Particles are assumed to diffuse in angle due to frequent
non-resonant scattering on small-scale fields. The steady-state distribution of
particles' Lorentz factors is shown to approximately satisfy $dN/d\gamma
\propto \gamma^{-2.2}$ provided the particle motion is scattering dominated on
at least one side of the shock. For scattering dominated transport, the
acceleration rate scales as $t_{\rm acc}\propto t^{1/2}$, though recovers Bohm
scaling $t_{\rm acc}\propto t$ if particles become magnetised on one side of
the shock. For uniform field configurations, a limiting energy is reached when
particles are magnetised on both sides of the shock. For the cylindrical field
configuration, this limit does not apply, and particles of one sign of charge
will experience a curvature drift that redirects particles upstream. For the
non-resonant scattering model considered, these particles preferentially escape
only when they reach the confinement limit determined by the finite system
size, and the distribution approaches the escapeless limit $dN/d\gamma \propto
\gamma^{-1}$. The cylindrical field configuration resembles that expected for
jets launched by the Blandford $\&$ Znajek mechanism, the luminous jets of AGN
and GRBs thus provide favourable sites for the production of ultra-high energy
cosmic rays.

in one single pointing and, with an adequate cadence, to identify the variable
sources contained. In this paper, we present the result of a DECam
observational campaign toward the LMC and give a catalogue of the observed
variable sources. We considered all the available DECam observations of the
LMC, acquired during 32 nights over a period of two years (from February 2018

characterizing variable sources in the observed fields. Here, we report on the
first 15 deg2 in and around the LMC as observed by DECam, testing the
capabilities of our pipeline. Since many of the observed fields cover a rather
crowded region of the sky, we adopted the ISIS subtraction package which, even
in these conditions, can detect variables at a very low signal to noise ratio.
All the potentially identified variable sources were then analyzed and each
light curve tested for periodicity by using the Lomb-Scargle and
Schwarzenberg-Czerny algorithms. Furthermore, we classified the identified
sources by using the UPSILoN neural network. This analysis allowed us to find
70 981 variable stars, 1266 of which were previously unknown. We estimated the
period of the variables and compared it with the available values in the

process misspelled queries, which constitute a significant portion of query
traffic in commercial search engines. The main issue is that the pre-trained
language model-based encoders used by DRs are typically trained and fine-tuned
using clean, well-curated text data. Misspelled queries are typically not found
in the data used for training these models, and thus misspelled queries
observed at inference time are out-of-distribution compared to the data used
for training and fine-tuning. Previous efforts to address this issue have
focused on \textit{fine-tuning} strategies, but their effectiveness on
misspelled queries remains lower than that of pipelines that employ separate
state-of-the-art spell-checking components. To address this challenge, we
propose ToRoDer (TypOs-aware bottlenecked pre-training for RObust DEnse
Retrieval), a novel \textit{pre-training} strategy for DRs that increases their
robustness to misspelled queries while preserving their effectiveness in
downstream retrieval tasks. ToRoDer utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture
where the encoder takes misspelled text with masked tokens as input and outputs
bottlenecked information to the decoder. The decoder then takes as input the
bottlenecked embeddings, along with token embeddings of the original text with
the misspelled tokens masked out. The pre-training task is to recover the
masked tokens for both the encoder and decoder. Our extensive experimental
results and detailed ablation studies show that DRs pre-trained with ToRoDer
exhibit significantly higher effectiveness on misspelled queries, sensibly
closing the gap with pipelines that use a separate, complex spell-checker
component, while retaining their effectiveness on correctly spelled queries.

proposed forms of the poroelastic strain energy with diffused fracture and
assesses their ability to recover the explicit fracture opening aperture. We
then propose a new form of degraded poroelastic strain energy derived from
micromechanical analyses. Unlike the previously proposed models, our
poroelastic strain energy degradation depends not only on the phase--field
variable (damage) but also on the type of strain energy decomposition.
Comparisons against closed form solutions suggest that our proposed model can
recover crack opening displacement more accurately irrespective of Biot's
coefficient or the pore--pressure distribution. We then verify our model
against the plane strain hydraulic fracture propagation, known as the KGD

central segregation of blue stragglers stars (BSSs) within the cluster
half-mass radius by means of the $A^+_{rh}$ parameter, defined as the area
enclosed between the cumulative radial distribution of BSSs and that of a
lighter population. The total sample with homogeneous determinations of

Cloud, and 2 young systems in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The three objects
studied here nicely nest into the correlation between $A^+_{rh}$ and the
central relaxation time defined by the previous sample, thus proving and
consolidating the use of the dynamical clock as an excellent tracer of the

Majorana zero modes, they have been suggested as a platform for topological
quantum computing. Yet, conclusive proof of 1D topological superconductivity
has remained elusive. Here, we employ low-temperature scanning tunnelling
microscopy to show 1D topological superconductivity in a van der Waals
heterostructure by directly probing its superconducting properties, instead of
relying on the observation of Majorana zero modes at its boundary. We realise
this by placing the two-dimensional topological insulator monolayer WTe$_2$ on
the superconductor NbSe$_2$. We find that the superconducting topological edge
state is robust against magnetic fields, a hallmark of its triplet pairing. Its
topological protection is underpinned by a lateral self-proximity effect, which
is resilient against disorder in the monolayer edge. By creating this exotic
state in a van der Waals heterostructure, we provide an adaptable platform for
the future realization of Majorana bound states. Finally, our results more

environment. Consequently, state-of-the-art AVs employ potent sensor systems to
achieve the best possible environment representation at all times. Although
these high-performing systems achieve impressive results, they induce
significant requirements for the processing capabilities of an AV's
computational hardware components and their energy consumption.
  To enable a dynamic adaptation of such perception systems based on the
situational perception requirements, we introduce a model-agnostic method for
the scalable employment of single-frame object detection models using
frame-dropping in tracking-by-detection systems. We evaluate our approach on
the KITTI 3D Tracking Benchmark, showing that significant energy savings can be
achieved at acceptable performance degradation, reaching up to 28% reduction of
energy consumption at a performance decline of 6.6% in HOTA score.

be fitted to a power-law form of $\omega_\theta =
0.045^{+0.114}_{-0.106}~\theta^{-0.8}$ over a scale of $0.2\!-\!10$ degrees. We
compare the ACF of the quasars to that predicted for the PBH model at $z\sim 6$
and found that such a scenario is excluded for a broad range of parameter
space, from which we can conclude that a scenario with PBHs as SMBHs is not
viable. We also discuss a model in which SMBHs at $z \sim 6$ originate from the
direct collapse of PBH clumps and argue that the observed ACF excludes such a
scenario in the context of our PBH model.

mode of a balanced ESCS, the GP compresses in an elliptical manner along the
axis of the coherence parameter of the corresponding mode. While in the case of
unbalanced ESCS, the GP compresses in a hyperbolic manner by increasing the

computation proceeds via measurements on a resource state. So-called flow
conditions ensure that the overall computation is deterministic in a suitable
sense, with Pauli flow being the most general of these. Computations,
represented as measurement patterns, may be rewritten to optimise resource use
and for other purposes. Such rewrites need to preserve the existence of flow to
ensure the new pattern can still be implemented deterministically. The majority
of existing work in this area has focused on rewrites that reduce the number of
qubits, yet it can be beneficial to increase the number of qubits for certain
kinds of optimisation, as well as for obfuscation.
  In this work, we introduce several ZX-calculus rewrite rules that increase
the number of qubits and preserve the existence of Pauli flow. These rules can
be used to transform any measurement pattern into a pattern containing only
(general or Pauli) measurements within the XY-plane. We also give the first
flow-preserving rewrite rule that allows measurement angles to be changed
arbitrarily, and use this to prove that the `neighbour unfusion' rule of
Staudacher et al. preserves the existence of Pauli flow. This implies it may be
possible to reduce the runtime of their two-qubit-gate optimisation procedure
by removing the need to regularly run the costly gflow-finding algorithm.

have been widely applied in the real world. Recently, few-shot knowledge graph
completion (FKGC), which aims to predict missing facts for unseen relations
with few-shot associated facts, has attracted increasing attention from
practitioners and researchers. However, existing FKGC methods are based on
metric learning or meta-learning, which often suffer from the
out-of-distribution and overfitting problems. Meanwhile, they are incompetent
at estimating uncertainties in predictions, which is critically important as
model predictions could be very unreliable in few-shot settings. Furthermore,
most of them cannot handle complex relations and ignore path information in
KGs, which largely limits their performance. In this paper, we propose a
normalizing flow-based neural process for few-shot knowledge graph completion
(NP-FKGC). Specifically, we unify normalizing flows and neural processes to
model a complex distribution of KG completion functions. This offers a novel
way to predict facts for few-shot relations while estimating the uncertainty.
Then, we propose a stochastic ManifoldE decoder to incorporate the neural
process and handle complex relations in few-shot settings. To further improve
performance, we introduce an attentive relation path-based graph neural network
to capture path information in KGs. Extensive experiments on three public

FKGC methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

causal inference under covariate-adaptive randomizations (CARs). On one hand,
RAs can improve the efficiency of causal estimators by incorporating
information from covariates that are not used in the randomization. On the
other hand, RAs can degrade estimation efficiency due to their estimation
errors, which are not asymptotically negligible when the number of regressors
is of the same order as the sample size. Failure to account for the cost of RAs
can result in over-rejection of causal inference under the null hypothesis. To
address this issue, we develop a unified inference theory for the
regression-adjusted average treatment effect (ATE) estimator under CARs. Our
theory has two key features: (1) it ensures the exact asymptotic size under the
null hypothesis, regardless of whether the number of covariates is fixed or

points. Recently, a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ CDW was discovered in the kagome
metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ below $T_{\rm CDW}\approx91$~K, whose underlying mechanism
and formation process remain unclear. Using inelastic X-ray scattering, we

ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ well above $T_{\rm CDW}$, distinct from the
$\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ CDW below $T_{\rm CDW}$. The short-range CDW
grows upon cooling, and is accompanied by the softening of phonons, indicative
of its dynamic nature. As the $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ CDW appears, the
short-range CDW becomes suppressed, revealing a competition between these CDW
instabilities. Our first-principles calculations indicate that the
$\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times2$ CDW is energetically favored, consistent with
experimental observations at high temperatures. However, the
$\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ CDW is selected as the ground state likely due
to a large wavevector-dependent electron-phonon coupling, which also accounts
for the enhanced electron scattering above $T_{\rm CDW}$. The competing CDW
instabilities in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ lead to an unusual CDW formation process, with
the most pronounced phonon softening and the static CDW occurring at different
wavevectors.

chemiluminescent emission from various roto-vibrational bands of hydroxyl (OH),
which is therefore a good tracer of the chemistry and dynamics at the emission
altitudes. Intensity variations can, e.g., be caused by the general
circulation, gravity waves, tides, planetary waves, and the solar activity.
While the basic OH response to the different dynamical influences has been
studied quite frequently, detailed comparisons of the various individual lines
are still rare. Such studies can improve our understanding of the OH-related
variations as each line shows a different emission profile. We have therefore
used about 90,000 spectra of the X-shooter spectrograph of the Very Large
Telescope at Cerro Paranal in Chile in order to study 10 years of variations of
298 OH lines. The analysis focuses on climatologies of intensity, solar cycle
effect, and residual variability (especially with respect to time scales of
hours and about 2 days) for day of year and local time. For a better
understanding of the resulting variability patterns and the line-specific
differences, we applied decomposition techniques, studied the variability
depending on time scale, and calculated correlations. As a result, the mixing
of thermalized and nonthermalized OH level populations clearly influences the
amplitude of the variations. Moreover, the local times of the variability
features shift depending on the effective line emission height, which can
mainly be explained by the propagation of the migrating diurnal tide. This
behavior also contributes to remarkable differences in the effective solar
cycle effect.

of bosons with an arbitrary repulsion strength. We finally study the evolution

importance as conversational agents become more and more common. Recognizing
emotions is key for effective communication, being a crucial component in the

understanding of the conversational context are extremely valuable for
identifying the emotions of the interlocutor. We thus approach Emotion
Recognition in Conversations leveraging the conversational context, i.e.,
taking into attention previous conversational turns. The usual approach to
model the conversational context has been to produce context-independent
representations of each utterance and subsequently perform contextual modeling
of these. Here we propose context-dependent embedding representations of each
utterance by leveraging the contextual representational power of pre-trained
transformer language models. In our approach, we feed the conversational
context appended to the utterance to be classified as input to the RoBERTa
encoder, to which we append a simple classification module, thus discarding the
need to deal with context after obtaining the embeddings since these constitute
already an efficient representation of such context. We also investigate how
the number of introduced conversational turns influences our model performance.
The effectiveness of our approach is validated on the open-domain DailyDialog

analyze the Linemod dataset, considered the state of the art in 6D pose
estimation context. That dataset presents images accompanied by ArUco markers;
it is evident that such markers will not be available in real-world contexts.
We analyze how the presence of the markers affects the pose estimation
accuracy, and how this bias may be mitigated through data augmentation and
other methods. Our work aims to show how the presence of these markers goes to
modify, in the testing phase, the effectiveness of the deep learning method
used. In particular, we will demonstrate, through the tool of saliency maps,
how the focus of the neural network is captured in part by these ArUco markers.
Finally, a new dataset, obtained by applying geometric tools to Linemod, will
be proposed in order to demonstrate our hypothesis and uncovering the bias. Our
results demonstrate the potential for bias in 6DOF pose estimation networks,
and suggest methods for reducing this bias when training with markers.

manipulation and has been researched for decades. However, it is still very
challenging for some reasons. First, compared with humans, current robots are
extremely inflexible, and therefore have higher requirements on the accuracy of
base placements (BPs). Second, the BP and task constraints are coupled with
each other. The optimal BP depends on the task constraints, and in BP will
affect task constraints in turn. More tricky is that some task constraints are
flexible and non-deterministic. Third, except for fulfilling tasks, some other
performance metrics such as optimal energy consumption and minimal execution
time need to be considered, which makes the BPO problem even more complicated.
In this paper, a Scale-like disc (SLD) representation of the workspace is used
to decouple task constraints and BPs. To evaluate reachability and return
optimal working pose over SLDs, a reachability map (RM) is constructed offline.
In order to optimize the objectives of coverage, manipulability, and time cost
simultaneously, this paper formulates the BPO as a multi-objective optimization
problem (MOOP). Among them, the time optimal objective is modeled as a
traveling salesman problem (TSP), which is more in line with the actual
situation. The evolutionary method is used to solve the MOOP. Besides, to
ensure the validity and optimality of the solution, collision detection is
performed on the candidate BPs, and solutions from BPO are further fine-tuned
according to the specific given task. Finally, the proposed method is used to
solve a real-world toilet coverage cleaning task. Experiments show that the
optimized BPs can significantly improve the coverage and efficiency of the
task.

the absence of the derivative discontinuity. The ensemble generalization

can reflect the relative skill levels among players. Embeddings are
low-dimensional vector representations that can be conveniently applied to
subsequent tasks while still preserving the topological relationships in a
graph. In the latter part of this paper, Graphical Elo (GElo) is introduced as
an application of player embeddings when rating player skills. GElo is an

antiferromagnet in a uniform magnetic field), this bicritical point is found to
exhibit a crossover from the isotropic $n$-component universal critical
behavior to a fluctuation-driven first-order transition, asymptotically turning
into a triple point. Using a novel expansion of the renormalization group
recursion relations near the isotropic fixed point, combined with a resummation
of the sixth-order diagrammatic expansions of the coefficients in this
expansion, we show that the above crossover is slow, explaining the apparently
observed second-order transition. However, the effective critical exponents
near that transition, which are calculated here, vary strongly as the triple
point is approached.

  In this paper, we systematically study the relative expressive power of
structural subtyping and parametric polymorphism. We focus our investigation on
establishing the extent to which parametric polymorphism, in the form of row

record types. We base our study on various Church-style $\lambda$-calculi
extended with records and variants, different forms of structural subtyping,

  We characterise expressiveness by exhibiting compositional translations

results. By imposing restrictions on both source and target types, we reveal
further subtleties in the expressiveness landscape, the restrictions enabling

for a tactical advantage and the applicability of such research to multi-agent
interaction systems. Team sports contain a significant social component that
influences interactions between teammates and opponents. However, it still
needs to be fully exploited. In this work, we hypothesize that each participant
has a specific function in each action and that role-based interaction is
critical for predicting players' future moves. We create RolFor, a novel
end-to-end model for Role-based Forecasting. RolFor uses a new module we
developed called Ordering Neural Networks (OrderNN) to permute the order of the
players such that each player is assigned to a latent role. The latent role is
then modeled with a RoleGCN. Thanks to its graph representation, it provides a
fully learnable adjacency matrix that captures the relationships between roles
and is subsequently used to forecast the players' future trajectories.
Extensive experiments on a challenging NBA basketball dataset back up the
importance of roles and justify our goal of modeling them using optimizable
models. When an oracle provides roles, the proposed RolFor compares favorably
to the current state-of-the-art (it ranks first in terms of ADE and second in
terms of FDE errors). However, training the end-to-end RolFor incurs the issues
of differentiability of permutation methods, which we experimentally review.
Finally, this work restates differentiable ranking as a difficult open problem
and its great potential in conjunction with graph-based interaction models.

new physical treatment of AGN-driven winds into our semi-analytic model of
galaxy formation. To each galaxy in our model, we associate solutions for the
outflow expansion and the mass outflow rates in different directions, depending
on the AGN luminosity, on the circular velocity of the host halo, and on gas
content of the considered galaxy. To each galaxy we also assign an effective
radius derived from energy conservation during merger events, and a stellar
velocity dispersion self-consistently computed via Jeans modelling. We derive
all the main scaling relations between Black hole (BH) mass and total/bulge
stellar mass, velocity dispersion, host halo dark matter mass, and star
formation efficiency. We find that our improved AGN feedback mostly controls
the dispersion around the relations but plays a subdominant role in shaping
slopes and/or normalizations of the scaling relations. Including possible
limited-resolution selection biases in the model provides better agreement with
the available data. The model does not point to any more fundamental galactic
property linked to BH mass, with velocity dispersion playing a similar role
with respect to stellar mass, in tension with present data. In line with other
independent studies carried out on comprehensive semi-analytic and hydrodynamic
galaxy-BH evolution models, our current results signal either an inadequacy of
present cosmological models of galaxy formation in fully reproducing the local

incompleteness issue affecting the local sample of dynamically-measured BHs.

red-giant and red-clump stars with asteroseismic ages observed by both APOGEE

catalogues, we investigate some of the classical chemical, positional, and
kinematic relationships of the stars as a function of their age. We find a very
clear imprint of the outer-disc flare in the age maps and confirm the recently
found split in the local age-metallicity relation. We present new and precise
measurements of the Galactic radial metallicity gradient in small age bins
between 0.5 and 12 Gyr, confirming a steeper metallicity gradient for 2-5 Gyr
old populations and a subsequent flattening for older populations mostly
produced by radial migration. In addition, we analyse the dispersion about the
abundance gradient as a function of age. We find a clear power-law trend (with
an exponent $\beta\approx0.15$) for this relation, indicating a smooth radial
migration history in the Galactic disc over the past 7-9 Gyr. Departures from
this power law are detected at ages of 8 Gyr (possibly related to the Gaia
Sausage/Enceladus merger) and 2.75 Gyr (possibly related to an enhancement of
the star-formation rate in the Galactic disc). Finally, we confirm previous

an area law entangled phase. We also show that (3) decoherence noises over a

Ashkin-Teller model, and the entanglement characteristics of the resulting

canonical space. Recent works rely on linear blend skinning (LBS) to achieve
the canonical-observation transformation. However, the linearly weighted
combination of rigid transformation matrices is not guaranteed to be rigid. As
a matter of fact, unexpected scale and shear factors often appear. In practice,
using LBS as the deformation model can always lead to skin-collapsing artifacts

perform rigid transformation without skin-collapsing artifacts. In the endeavor
to register 2D pixels across different frames, we establish a correspondence
between canonical feature embeddings that encodes 3D points within the

between neurons) always lead to higher and more stable degrees of CS and PS in
small-world and random networks, provided that the network parameters such as
the synaptic time delay $\tau_c$, the average degree $\langle k \rangle$, and
the rewiring probability $\beta$ have some appropriate values. When $\tau_c$,

and SDSS spectroscopic surveys. We find that these five DPGPs have blueshifted
narrow components more prominent than the redshifted components, with velocity
offsets of [OIII]$\lambda$5007 lines ranging from 306 to 518 $\rm km\, s^{-1}$
and full widths at half maximums (FWHMs) of individual components ranging from
263 to 441 $\rm km\, s^{-1}$. By analyzing the spectra and the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs), we find that they have larger metallicities and stellar
masses compared with other GPs. The H$\alpha$ line width, emission-line
diagnostic, mid-infrared color, radio emission, and SED fitting provide
evidence of the AGN activities in these DPGPs. They have the same spectral
properties of Type 2 quasars. Furthermore, we discuss the possible nature of
the double-peaked narrow emission-line profiles of these DPGPs and find that
they are more likely to be dual AGN. These DPGP galaxies are ideal laboratories
for exploring the growth mode of AGN in the extremely luminous emission-line
galaxies, the co-evolution between AGN and host galaxies, and the evolution of
high-redshift galaxies in the early Universe.

complexity and cost. The sensitivity curve of such a detector is at least two
orders of magnitude lower in amplitude than that of LISA. Depending on the
choice of other instrument parameters, this makes the detector sensitive to
gravitational waves in the micro-Hertz range and opens a new window for
gravitational-wave astronomy, not covered by any other planned detector

machine learning methods for solving differential equations. However,
vanilla-PINNs fail to learn complex problems as ones involving stiff ordinary
differential equations (ODEs). This is the case of some initial value problems
(IVPs) when the amount of training data is too small and/or the integration
interval (for the variable like the time) is too large. We propose very simple
recipes to improve the training process in cases where only prior knowledge at
initial time of training data is known for IVPs. For example, more physics can
be easily embedded in the loss function in problems for which the total energy
is conserved. A better definition of the training data loss taking into account
all the initial conditions can be done. In a progressive learning approach, it
is also possible to use a growing time interval with a moving grid (of
collocation points) where the differential equation residual is minimized.
These improvements are also shown to be efficient in PINNs modeling for solving
boundary value problems (BVPs) as for the high Reynolds steady-state solution
of advection-diffusion equation.

longitudinal magnetoresistance at temperature T is negative and scales with
H/T. For both samples, the AMR is anisotropic and shows an unexpected
dependence on H intensity. While at the low magnetic field, one observes
essentially twofold AMR oscillations for the more doped sample, fourfold ones
start to grow under the high magnetic field, resulting in the coexistence of
the two. For the less doped film at the low magnetic field, both twofold and
fourfold AMR components exist. With the increase of the magnetic field, the
fourfold component survives a pi/4 phase shift, during which its amplitude
vanishes, at a magnetic field Hc such as: 16 T < Hc < 17 T. As a result, at the
high magnetic field above Hc, the angular dependence of the in-plane
magnetoresistance turns out to be the same for both samples. We tentatively

increasing acceleration, which is due to the Unruh effect that destroys the
quantum resource. Essentially, the variation of quantum coherence is caused by
the modes mismatch between the input and output mode. Through 2000 randomly
generated states, we demonstrate that such mismatch is dominated by the
acceleration effect and mildly affected by the waveform parameters. Moreover,
the squeezing parameter acted as a suppressor of the reduced coherence, but it
tended to be invalid in the high squeezing. In addition, the squeezing
parameter can act as a suppressor of the reduced coherence, but the effect of
the squeezing parameter tends to be ineffective under high squeezing
conditions.

causes not only image artefacts but also deteriorates the homogeneity of the
main magnetic field (B0), which is a prerequisite for high quality data. Thus,
characterization of changes to B0, e.g. induced by patient movement, is
important for MR applications that are prone to B0 inhomogeneities. We propose
a deep learning based method to predict such changes within the brain from the
change of the head position to facilitate retrospective or even real-time
correction. A 3D U-net was trained on in vivo brain 7T MRI data. The input
consisted of B0 maps and anatomical images at an initial position, and
anatomical images at a different head position (obtained by applying a
rigid-body transformation on the initial anatomical image). The output
consisted of B0 maps at the new head positions. We further fine-tuned the
network weights to each subject by measuring a limited number of head positions
of the given subject, and trained the U-net with these data. Our approach was
compared to established dynamic B0 field mapping via interleaved navigators,
which suffer from limited spatial resolution and the need for undesirable
sequence modifications. Qualitative and quantitative comparison showed similar
performance between an interleaved navigator-equivalent method and proposed
method. We therefore conclude that it is feasible to predict B0 maps from rigid
subject movement and, when combined with external tracking hardware, this
information could be used to improve the quality of magnetic resonance
acquisitions without the use of navigators.

domain-specific information on integer variables to QBF solvers. This is
particularly appealing for parallel Divide-and-Conquer solving which partitions
the search space into independently solvable sub-problems. Using this
technique, we reduce the number of generated sub-problems from a full expansion

rule-based control (RBC) and model predictive control (MPC) methods. Recent
research are investigating reinforcement learning (RL) as a new promising
approach. This paper introduces TreeC, a machine learning method that uses the
metaheuristic algorithm covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy
(CMA-ES) to generate an interpretable EMS modeled as a decision tree. This
method learns the decision strategy of the EMS based on historical data
contrary to RBC and MPC approaches that are typically considered as non
adaptive solutions. The decision strategy of the EMS is modeled as a decision
tree and is thus interpretable contrary to RL which mainly uses black-box
models (e.g. neural networks). The TreeC method is compared to RBC, MPC and RL
strategies in two study cases taken from literature: (1) an electric grid case
and (2) a household heating case. The results show that TreeC obtains close
performances than MPC with perfect forecast in both cases and obtains similar
performances to RL in the electrical grid case and outperforms RL in the
household heating case. TreeC demonstrates a performant application of machine
learning for energy management systems that is also fully interpretable.

impact on human life are the tectonic faults slip. These landslides have
different ways to manifest, ranging from aseismic events of slow displacement
(slow slips) to ordinary earthquakes. An example of continuous slow slip event
was identified in Cascadia, near the island of Vancouver (CA). This slow slip
event is associated with a tectonic movements, when the overriding North
America plate lurches southwesterly over the subducting Juan de Fuca plate.
This region is located down-dip the seismogenic rupture zone, which has not
been activated since 1700s but has been cyclically loaded by the slow slip
movement. This fact requires some attention, since slow slip events have
already been reported in literature as possible triggering factors for
earthquakes. Nonetheless, the physical models to describe the slow slip events
are still incomplete, which restricts the detailed knowledge of the movements
and the associated tremor. In the original paper, the strategy adopted by the
authors to address the limitation of the current models for the slow slip
events was to use Random Forest machine learning algorithm to construct a model
capable to predict GPS displacement measurement from the continuous seismic
data. This investigation is sustained in the fact that the statistical features
of the seismic data are a fingerprint of the fault displacement rate.
Therefore, predicting GPS data from seismic data can make GPS measurements a
proxy for investigating the fault slip physics and, additionally, correlate
this slow slip events with associated tremors that can be studied in
laboratory. The purpose of this report is to expose the methodology adopted by
the authors and try to reproduce their results as coherent as possible with the

is often modeled as Transient Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow
(TSC-OPF), trains efficient dispatching agents that can adapt to different
scenarios and provide control strategies quickly. However, three typical issues
seriously affect the training efficiency and the performance of the dispatch
agent, namely, the difficulty of quantifying the transient instability level,
the high dimensionality of the state space and action space, and the frequent
generation of actions that correspond to non-convergent power flows during the
early training stage. To address these issues, a fast-converged DRL method for
TSC-OPF is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a transient security constraint
transcription method based on the simulation time duration of instability is
proposed to quantify the instability level. Secondly, a general method for
Markov decision process modeling of TSC-OPF is proposed to decrease the
dimensionality of the observation space. Finally, two general improvement
techniques for off-policy DRL algorithms are proposed. A warm-up training
technique is introduced to improve the efficiency of agents learning how to
generate actions that lead to convergent power flows. A parallel exploration
technique is adopted to improve the efficiency of agents exploring the action
space. Based on the above studies, environments for TSC-OPF with the objectives
of minimizing generation cost and minimizing control cost are constructed and
dispatch agents are built and trained. The proposed method is tested in the
IEEE 39-bus system and a practical 710-bus regional power grid. Test results
show that the training process converges rapidly, the success rate of dispatch
in both cases exceeds 99.70 percent, and the decision-making costs very little
time, which verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

effective gain on the electric fields in the drift and induction gaps ranging
from 100-650 V cm$^{-1}$ and 500-5000 V cm$^{-1}$, respectively, in the
selected gas mixture. The effective gain weakly depended on the drift field
while it was almost linearly proportional to the induction field: 2.4 times
higher at 5000 V cm$^{-1}$ than at 1000 V cm$^{-1}$. With the optimal induction
and drift fields, the flight model GMC achieves an effective gain of 460 with
an applied GEM voltage of 590 V.

these approaches are \emph{goal-oriented} in that the goal is to estimate some
quantities of interest (QoI) that are functions of the solution of an inverse

computing uncertainty metrics associated with the QoI, thus utilizing a
Bayesian approach for inverse problems that incorporates the prediction
operator and techniques for exploring the posterior. This may be particularly
challenging, especially for nonlinear, possibly unknown, operators and
nonstandard prior assumptions. We harness recent advances in machine learning,
i.e., VED networks, to describe a data-driven approach to large-scale inverse
problems. This enables a real-time goal-oriented uncertainty quantification for
the QoI. One of the advantages of our approach is that we avoid the need to
solve challenging inversion problems by training a network to approximate the
mapping from observations to QoI. Another main benefit is that we enable
uncertainty quantification for the QoI by leveraging probability distributions
in the latent space. This allows us to efficiently generate QoI samples and
circumvent complicated or even unknown forward models and prediction operators.
Numerical results from medical tomography reconstruction and nonlinear
hydraulic tomography demonstrate the potential and broad applicability of the

observed number of HU image formations in cluster lenses is expected to
increase in future, it is timely to investigate them in more detail. Like fold
and cusp, HU also satisfies the magnification relation, i.e., the signed
magnification sum of the four images equals zero. This work presents a detailed
study of HU magnification relation ($R_{\rm hu}$) considering the elliptical
Navarro-Frenk-White (eNFW) lens profile suitable for cluster scale dark matter
halos. Our results show that for an isolated eNFW lens, $R_{\rm hu}$ is more
sensitive to ellipticity than its mass or concentration parameter. An
ellipticity greater than 0.3 results in $R_{\rm hu}$ lying close to zero with a
small scatter around it. A substructure near the HU image formation causes the
average $R_{\rm hu}$ value to deviate from zero and increases the scatter, with
the amount of deviation depending on the image type near which the substructure
lies. However, a population of substructures in the lens plane (equivalent to
the galaxy lenses inside the cluster) does not significantly shift the average
$R_{\rm hu}$ value from zero but increases the scatter around it. We find that
$R_{\rm hu} \simeq 0$ for HU image formation in the Abell 1703 cluster.
Repeating this test in other clusters where HU formations are discovered can be

Galaxy Assembly with Binary Evolution (GABE) in a unified and self-consistent

binary systems. We find that the amplitudes of the principal peaks of the SGWB
energy density are within one order of magnitude $\Omega_{GW} \sim 10^{-9}-
10^{-8}$. This SGWB can be easily detected by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA),
as well as planned interferometric detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope

this background varies as $\Omega_{GW} \propto f^{2/3}$ in the SKA band. The

allow the space-based detector LISA to distinguish the black hole seed models.
The amplitude of the SGWB from merging stellar binary black holes (BBHs) at

binary neutron stars (BNSs) and neutron-star-black-hole (NSBH) mergers,

classical methods since the Bayesian approach gives a probabilistic description
of the problems and offers the ability to quantify the uncertainty in the

proves to be successful, due to the increasing representation ability of
data-based models. In this work, we try to incorporate the data-based models
into a class of Langevin-based sampling algorithms in Bayesian inference.
Loosely speaking, we introduce NF-ULA (Unadjusted Langevin algorithms by
Normalizing Flows), which involves learning a normalizing flow as the prior. In
particular, our algorithm only requires a pre-trained normalizing flow, which
is independent of the considered inverse problem and the forward operator. We
perform theoretical analysis by investigating the well-posedness of the
Bayesian solution and the non-asymptotic convergence of the NF-ULA algorithm.
The efficacy of the proposed NF-ULA algorithm is demonstrated in various
imaging problems, including image deblurring, image inpainting, and

cover. They are strongly localized deformations often associated with the
formation of leads and pressure ridges. Viscous-plastic sea-ice models start to
produce LKFs at high spatial grid resolution, typically with a grid spacing
below 5 km. A recent study showed that the placement of the variables on the
grid plays an important role for the number of simulated LKFs. The study found
that a nonconforming finite element discretization with a CD-grid placement
(CD1) resolves more LKFs per degree of freedom compared to more common A,B and
C-grids. A new CD-grid formulation (CD2) has just been proposed based on a
conforming subgrid discretization. To analyze the resolution properties of the
new CD2 approach we evaluate runs from different models (e.g FESOM, MPAS) on a
benchmark problem using quadrilateral, hexagonal and triangular meshes. We
found that the CD1 setup simulates more deformation structure than the CD2
approximation. This highlights the importance of the type of spatial
discretization for the simulation of LKFs. Due to the higher number of degrees
of freedom both CD-grids resolve more LKFs than traditional A,B and C-grids at
fixed mesh level. This is an appealing feature as high spatial mesh resolution
is needed in viscous-plastic sea-ice models to simulate LKFs.

them to overcome physical limitations and explore new frontiers. With the
advent of foundation models, AI systems have the potential to be equally adept
in tool use as humans. This paradigm, i.e., tool learning with foundation
models, combines the strengths of specialized tools and foundation models to
achieve enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and automation in problem-solving.
Despite its immense potential, there is still a lack of a comprehensive
understanding of key challenges, opportunities, and future endeavors in this
field. To this end, we present a systematic investigation of tool learning in
this paper. We first introduce the background of tool learning, including its
cognitive origins, the paradigm shift of foundation models, and the
complementary roles of tools and models. Then we recapitulate existing tool
learning research into tool-augmented and tool-oriented learning. We formulate
a general tool learning framework: starting from understanding the user
instruction, models should learn to decompose a complex task into several
subtasks, dynamically adjust their plan through reasoning, and effectively
conquer each sub-task by selecting appropriate tools. We also discuss how to
train models for improved tool-use capabilities and facilitate the
generalization in tool learning. Considering the lack of a systematic tool
learning evaluation in prior works, we experiment with 17 representative tools
and show the potential of current foundation models in skillfully utilizing
tools. Finally, we discuss several open problems that require further
investigation for tool learning. Overall, we hope this paper could inspire
future research in integrating tools with foundation models.

  effects of quantum degeneracy",,,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The proton-boron (p-$^{11}$B) reaction is regarded as the holy grail of
advanced fusion fuels, since the primary reaction produces three $\alpha$
particles with few neutrons and induced radio-activities from second order
reactions. Compared to the Deuterium-Tritium reaction a much higher reaction
temperature is required. Moreover, bremsstrahlung energy losses due to the high
nuclear charge of boron deem it seemingly apparent than a fusion reactor based
on Deuterium-Tritium plasma in equilibrium is to say the least very
difficult.It is becoming more appealing to collide intense laser beams or
accelerated proton beams with a boron target to produce p-$^{11}$B reactions.
The fusion yield of p-$^{11}$B reactions is closely related to proton beam
parameters and boron target conditions such as density, temperature, and
ingredients. Quantum degeneracy will increase fusion yields by reducing the
stopping power of injected protons. In this work, we suggest a high-efficiency
scheme for beam-target p-$^{11}$B fusions via injecting a MeV proton beam into
a highly compressed quantum degenerated boron target. Such a boron target can
be achieved via quasi-isentropic compression of solid boron by using precisely
shaped laser pulses. Our results indicate that for densities ranging from
$10^3$ to $10^4\rho_s$, where $\rho_s$ is the density of solid boron,
contributions of bound and free electrons to the stopping of protons can be
completely disregarded and dramatically reduced respectively. The result is an
increase in fusion yield by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, in order to
achieve multiplication factor $F$ greater than one, with $F$ defined as the
ratio of output fusion energy to the energy of injected protons, it is found
there exits a minimum possible density of boron target, which is $2.15 \times
10^4 \rho_s$ when the kinetic energy of injected protons is $0.8$ MeV.

codes, particularly graph codes, have attracted considerable attention due to
their unique properties and potential applications. Concatenated codes, which
combine multiple layers of quantum codes, offer a powerful technique for
achieving high levels of error correction with a relatively low resource
overhead. In this paper, we examine the concatenation of graph codes using the
powerful and versatile graphical language of ZX-calculus. We establish a
correspondence between the encoding map and ZX-diagrams, and provide a simple
proof of the equivalence between encoding maps in the Pauli X basis and the
graphic operation ""generalized local complementation"" (GLC) as previously

resulting concatenated code remains a graph code only when the encoding qubits
of the same inner code are not directly connected. When they are directly
connected, additional Clifford operations are necessary to transform the
concatenated code into a graphcode, thus generalizing the results in [J. Math.
Phys. 52, 022201]. We further explore concatenated graph codesin different
bases, including the examination of holographic codes as concatenated graph

decreased mobility in seniors. The lack of sufficient data in the medical field
is always a challenge for training a learning model due to the high cost of
labelling. At present, deep neural network training strongly depends on data
augmentation to improve the model's generalization capability and avoid
over-fitting. However, existing data augmentation operations, such as rotation,
gamma correction, etc., are designed based on the data itself, which does not
substantially increase the data diversity. In this paper, we proposed a novel
approach based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) model with Selective Shuffled
Position Embedding (SSPE) and a ROI-exchange strategy to obtain different input
sequences as a method of data augmentation for early detection of KOA (KL-0 vs
KL-2). More specifically, we fixed and shuffled the position embedding of ROI
and non-ROI patches, respectively. Then, for the input image, we randomly
selected other images from the training set to exchange their ROI patches and
thus obtained different input sequences. Finally, a hybrid loss function was
derived using different loss functions with optimized weights. Experimental
results show that our proposed approach is a valid method of data augmentation
as it can significantly improve the model's classification performance.

reinforcement learning algorithm in an assembly problem of a given object,
aiming to identify the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the
optimisation of the assembly process time. A model-free Q-Learning algorithm is
applied, considering the learning of a matrix of Q-values (Q-table) from the
successive interactions with the environment to suggest an assembly sequence
solution. This implementation explores three scenarios with increasing
complexity so that the impact of the Q-Learning\textsc's parameters and rewards

optimisation approach achieved very promising results by learning the optimal

its image in the commutative quotient of the original group; and then using an
abelian hidden subgroup algorithm to determine this image. Knowing this image
allows one to descend to a proper subgroup unless the hidden subgroup is the
full group. The transformation relies on finding zero sum subsequences of
sufficiently large sequences of vectors over finite prime fields. We present a
new deterministic polynomial time algorithm for the latter problem in the case
when the size of the field is constant. The consequence is a polynomial time
exact quantum algorithm for the hidden subgroup problem in nilpotent groups
having constant nilpotency class and whose order only have prime factors also
bounded by a constant.

they only focus on either the user or item perspective. However, we discover
that the long-tailed user and item problems exist at the same time, and
considering only either one of them leads to sub-optimal performance of the
other one. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for SRS, called Mutual
Enhancement of Long-Tailed user and item (MELT), that jointly alleviates the
long-tailed problem in the perspectives of both users and items. MELT consists
of bilateral branches each of which is responsible for long-tailed users and
items, respectively, and the branches are trained to mutually enhance each
other, which is trained effectively by a curriculum learning-based training.
MELT is model-agnostic in that it can be seamlessly integrated with existing

alleviating the long-tailed problems in terms of both users and items even
without sacrificing the performance of head users and items, which has not been
achieved by existing methods. To the best of our knowledge, MELT is the first

visual feature from the fixed CLIP visual feature distribution. Combining both,

closely estimated using the cluster dynamics model. Parameters of the model,
namely, the binding energy of point defects, i.e., Ui and VU, to SIA and
vacancy loops respectively and the diffusivity of point defects govern the
energetics and kinetics of the defect clustering phenomenon. We have studied
the crystallography of defect loops and computed the binding energy of point
defects to such loops using an angular dependent EAM potential in classical MD
simulations. Using bond-boost hyperdynamics in LAMMPS, the anisotropic
diffusion of Ui and VU in {\alpha}-U has been investigated. The mechanisms of
point defect diffusion and the associated migration energies have also been
reported and compared with previous DFT studies. Our CD model uses the computed
parameters, within their error ranges, to predict the population of defect
clusters with a dose-rate and temperature similar to the neutron irradiation

before, during and after the arrival of a solar wind compression on March 18th,

brightening of the CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_2$ and C$_2$H$_4$ emissions in regions
spatially coincident with the northern, duskside main auroral emission
(henceforth, MAE). In inverting the spectra to derive atmospheric information,
we determine that the duskside brightening results from an upper stratospheric
(p < 0.1 mbar/z > 200 km) heating (e.g. $\Delta T$ = 9.1 $\pm$ 2.1 K at 9
$\mu$bar at 67.5$^\circ$N, 162.5$^\circ$W) with negligible heating at deeper
pressures. Our interpretation is that the arrival of the solar wind enhancement
drove magnetospheric dynamics through compression and/or viscous interactions
on the flank. These dynamics accelerated currents and/or generated higher
Poynting fluxes, which ultimately warmed the atmosphere through Joule heating
and ion-neutral collisions. Poleward of the southern MAE, temperature
retrievals demonstrate that auroral-related heating penetrates as deep as the
10-mbar level, in contrast to poleward of the northern MAE, where heating is
only observed as deep as $\sim$3 mbar. We suggest this results from the south
having higher Pedersen conductivities, and therefore stronger currents and
acceleration of the neutrals, as well as the poleward heating overlapping with
the apex of Jupiter's circulation thereby inhibiting efficient horizontal

reveal information about fundamental physics, cosmology and astrophysics. In
this work, we have extended the search for lensing signatures to all binary
black hole events from the third observing run of the LIGO--Virgo network. We
search for repeated signals from strong lensing by 1) performing targeted
searches for subthreshold signals, 2) calculating the degree of overlap amongst
the intrinsic parameters and sky location of pairs of signals, 3) comparing the
similarities of the spectrograms amongst pairs of signals, and 4) performing
dual-signal Bayesian analysis that takes into account selection effects and
astrophysical knowledge. We also search for distortions to the gravitational
waveform caused by 1) frequency-independent phase shifts in strongly lensed
images, and 2) frequency-dependent modulation of the amplitude and phase due to
point masses. None of these searches yields significant evidence for lensing.
Finally, we use the non-detection of gravitational-wave lensing to constrain
the lensing rate based on the latest merger-rate estimates and the fraction of
dark matter composed of compact objects.

fundamental task of battery management systems on electric vehicles. It aims at
estimating future SoH based on historical aging data. Most existing deep
learning methods rely on filter-based feature extractors (e.g., CNN or Kalman
filters) and recurrent time sequence models. Though efficient, they generally
ignore cyclic features and the domain gap between training and testing
batteries. To address this problem, we present CyFormer, a transformer-based
cyclic time sequence model for SoH prediction. Instead of the conventional
CNN-RNN structure, we adopt an encoder-decoder architecture. In the encoder,
row-wise and column-wise attention blocks effectively capture intra-cycle and
inter-cycle connections and extract cyclic features. In the decoder, the SoH
queries cross-attend to these features to form the final predictions. We
further utilize a transfer learning strategy to narrow the domain gap between
the training and testing set. To be specific, we use fine-tuning to shift the
model to a target working condition. Finally, we made our model more efficient
by pruning. The experiment shows that our method attains an MAE of 0.75\% with
only 10\% data for fine-tuning on a testing battery, surpassing prior methods
by a large margin. Effective and robust, our method provides a potential
solution for all cyclic time sequence prediction tasks.

performance by exploiting knowledge captured from previously-solved
optimization tasks stored in a database, has been gaining increasing research
attention in recent years. However, despite significant advancements in
algorithm design, the test problems in STO are not well designed. Oftentimes,
they are either randomly assembled by other benchmark functions that have
identical optima or are generated from practical problems that exhibit limited
variations. The relationships between the optimal solutions of source and
target tasks in these problems are manually configured and thus monotonous,
limiting their ability to represent the diverse relationships of real-world
problems. Consequently, the promising results achieved by many algorithms on
these problems are highly biased and difficult to be generalized to other
problems. In light of this, we first introduce a few rudimentary concepts for
characterizing STO problems (STOPs) and present an important problem feature
overlooked in previous studies, namely similarity distribution, which
quantitatively delineates the relationship between the optima of source and
target tasks. Then, we propose general design guidelines and a problem
generator with superior extendibility. Specifically, the similarity
distribution of a problem can be systematically customized by modifying a
parameterized density function, enabling a broad spectrum of representation for
the diverse similarity relationships of real-world problems. Lastly, a
benchmark suite with 12 individual STOPs is developed using the proposed
generator, which can serve as an arena for comparing different STO algorithms.

physics. Indeed, NCG provided a powerful framework for the reformulation of the
Standard Model of Particle Physics (SMPP), taking into account General
Relativity, in a single ""geometric"" representation, based on Non-Commutative
Gauge Theories (NCGFT). Moreover, this accomplishment provides a convenient
framework to study various possibilities to go beyond the SMPP, such as Grand
Unified Theories (GUTs). This thesis intends to show an elegant method recently
developed by Thierry Masson and myself, which proposes a general scheme to
elaborate GUTs in the framework of NCGFTs. This concerns the study of NCGFTs
based on approximately finite $C^*$-algebras (AF-algebras), using either
derivations of the algebra or spectral triples to build up the underlying
differential structure of the Gauge Theory. The inductive sequence defining the
AF-algebra is used to allow the construction of a sequence of NCGFTs of
Yang-Mills Higgs types, so that the rank $n+1$ can represent a grand unified
theory of the rank $n$. The main advantage of this framework is that it
controls, using appropriate conditions, the interaction of the degrees of
freedom along the inductive sequence on the AF algebra. This suggests a way to
obtain GUT-like models while offering many directions of theoretical

systems and online advertising platforms. When served in industrial scenarios,
the user-generated data observed by the CTR model typically arrives as a
stream. Streaming data has the characteristic that the underlying distribution
drifts over time and may recur. This can lead to catastrophic forgetting if the
model simply adapts to new data distribution all the time. Also, it's
inefficient to relearn distribution that has been occurred. Due to memory
constraints and diversity of data distributions in large-scale industrial
applications, conventional strategies for catastrophic forgetting such as
replay, parameter isolation, and knowledge distillation are difficult to be
deployed. In this work, we design a novel drift-aware incremental learning
framework based on ensemble learning to address catastrophic forgetting in CTR
prediction. With explicit error-based drift detection on streaming data, the
framework further strengthens well-adapted ensembles and freezes ensembles that
do not match the input distribution avoiding catastrophic interference. Both
evaluations on offline experiments and A/B test shows that our method
outperforms all baselines considered.

particle, the time step into sub-steps such that each of these sub-steps
corresponds to particle cell residence times. This reduces the spatial
discretization error. Given the stochastic nature of the models, a key aspect
is to derive estimations of the residence times that do not anticipate the
future of the Wiener process. To that effect, the new algorithm relies on a
virtual particle, attached to each stochastic one, whose mean conditional
behavior provides free-of-statistical-bias predictions of residence times.
After consistency checks, this new algorithm is validated on two representative

obtain competitive accuracy by mapping trained ANNs' parameters to SNNs with
the same structures. However, an enormous number of time steps are required for
these converted SNNs, thus losing the energy-efficient benefit. Utilizing both
the accuracy advantages of ANNs and the computing efficiency of SNNs, a novel
SNN training framework is proposed, namely layer-wise ANN-to-SNN knowledge
distillation (LaSNN). In order to achieve competitive accuracy and reduced
inference latency, LaSNN transfers the learning from a well-trained ANN to a
small SNN by distilling the knowledge other than converting the parameters of

introducing the attention scheme, the knowledge in an ANN is effectively

is considered. Forbidden trajectories for single particle integrals are
featured in the case of quantum tunneling across barriers. In the case of
multiparticle systems of indistinguishable identical particles, some limits for
the availability of cyclotron braid trajectories are demonstrated, which leads
to the explanation of statistics and correlation in quantum Hall systems of
interacting 2D electrons. The homotopy-type restrictions for trajectories close
to general-relativity singularities are discussed with indication of quantum
properties of black holes manifesting themselves at quasar luminosity or at
neutron star merger collapses. The related supplementation to conventional
models of accretion disk luminosity in the close vicinity of the event horizon
of a super massive black hole is proposed and compared with observations.

  count: 206 Tables: 1 Figures: 7 Boxes: 2 Submitted to JAMIA",,,,"cs.OH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Crafting, adhering to, and maintaining standards is an ongoing challenge.
This paper uses a framework based on common models to explore the standard
problem: the impossibility of creating, implementing or maintain definitive
common models in an open system. The problem arises from uncertainty driven by
variations in operating context, standard quality, differences in
implementation, and drift over time. Fitting work by conformance services
repairs these gaps between a standard and what is required for interoperation,
using several strategies: (a) Universal conformance (all agents access the same
standard); (b) Mediated conformance (an interoperability layer supports
heterogeneous agents) and (c) Localized conformance, (autonomous adaptive
agents manage their own needs). Conformance methods include incremental design,
modular design, adaptors, and creating interactive and adaptive agents. Machine
learning should have a major role in adaptive fitting. Choosing a conformance
service depends on the stability and homogeneity of shared tasks, and whether
common models are shared ahead of time or are adjusted at task time. This
analysis thus decouples interoperability and standardization. While standards
facilitate interoperability, interoperability is achievable without
standardization.

approaches a critical value is a growing concern with increasing greenhouse gas
concentrations. Predictions rely on detecting early warning signals (EWSs) in
observations of the system. The primary EWSs are increase in variance, (loss of
resilience), and increased autocorrelation (critical slow down). These measures
are statistical in nature, which implies that the reliability and statistical
significance of the detection depends on the sample size in observations and
the magnitude of the change away from the base value prior to the approach to
the tipping point. Thus, the possibility of providing useful early warning
depends on the relative magnitude of several interdependent time scales in the
system. These are (a) the time before the critical value is reached, (b) the
(inverse) rate of approach to the tipping point, (c) the size of the time
window required to detect a significant change in the EWS and finally, (d) the
escape time for noise-induced transition (prior to the tipping). Conditions for
early warning of tipping of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation
(AMOC) are marginally fulfilled for the existing past $\sim$150 years of proxy
observations where indicators of tipping have recently been reported. Here we
provide statistical significance and data driven estimators for the time of
tipping. We estimate a collapse of the AMOC to occur around the year 2057 under
the assumption of a ""business as usual"" scenario of future emissions.

eliminate the outlier models, and combine the strengths of multiple autoeval

on-chain (e.g., voting results) and off-chain data (e.g., community

Specifically, we defined metrics to characterize key aspects of DAOs, such as
the degrees of decentralization and autonomy. We observed CompoundDAO,
AssangeDAO, Bankless, and Krausehouse having poor decentralization in voting,
while decentralization has improved over time for one-person-one-vote DAOs
(e.g., Proof of Humanity). Moreover, the degree of autonomy varies among DAOs,
with some (e.g., Compound and Krausehouse) relying more on third parties than
others. Lastly, we offer a set of design implications for future DAO systems

Cyberinfrastructure with Computational Learning in the Environment (ICICLE) is
funded by the NSF to build the next generation of Cyberinfrastructure to render
AI more accessible to everyone and drive its further democratization in the
larger society. We describe our efforts to develop Jupyter Notebooks and Python
command line clients that would access these ICICLE resources and services
using ICICLE authentication mechanisms. To connect our clients, we used Tapis,
which is a framework that supports computational research to enable scientists
to access, utilize, and manage multi-institution resources and services. We
used Neo4j to organize data into a knowledge graph (KG). We then hosted the KG
on a Tapis Pod, which offers persistent data storage with a template made
specifically for Neo4j KGs. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of our
software, we developed several clients: Jupyter notebooks authentication,
Neural Networks (NN) notebook, and command line applications that provide a
convenient frontend to the Tapis API. In addition, we developed a data
processing notebook that can manipulate KGs on the Tapis servers, including
creations of a KG, data upload and modification. In this report we present the
software architecture, design and approach, the successfulness of our client
software, and future work.

level-set method with geometry-adapted sparse block grids on GPUs to
efficiently simulate reaction-diffusion processes in image-based geometries. We
showcase the method by applying it to fertilizer diffusion in soil, heat

academic sphere is a trending subject of interest in the computing education.
ChatGPT, as an AI-based tool, provides various advantages, such as heightened
student involvement, cooperation, accessibility and availability. This paper
addresses the prospects and obstacles associated with utilizing ChatGPT as a
tool for learning and assessment in undergraduate Computer Science curriculum
in particular to teaching and learning fundamental programming courses.
Students having completed the course work for a Data Structures and Algorithms
(a sophomore level course) participated in this study. Two groups of students
were given programming challenges to solve within a short period of time. The
control group (group A) had access to text books and notes of programming
courses, however no Internet access was provided. Group B students were given
access to ChatGPT and were encouraged to use it to help solve the programming
challenges. The challenge was conducted in a computer lab environment using PC2
environment. Each team of students address the problem by writing executable
code that satisfies certain number of test cases. Student teams were scored
based on their performance in terms of number of successful passed testcases.
Results show that students using ChatGPT had an advantage in terms of earned
scores, however there were inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the submitted
code consequently affecting the overall performance. After a thorough analysis,
the paper's findings indicate that incorporating AI in higher education brings
about various opportunities and challenges.

agricultural production, with most economies relying on imports to secure
adequate supplies. The N-nutrient trade system is vital for global food
security and ecological safety. We analyzed the N-nutrient trade network from
1991 to 2020, using the perspective of the temporal rich club (TRC), to
identify the core functional groups of global N-nutrient trade. Our analysis
revealed that the Netherlands, US, France, China, UK, Belgium, Germany, and
Spain form the stable cornerstone group from which other economies derive the
complete trade network. We found that simply increasing the volume of import
and export trade is insufficient to create an extensive and stable trade
structure. Instead, the most effective way to enter the core of the trade
network is to increase upstream and downstream trade partners and enhance its
own importance and reputation. Our mathematical model suggests that the
generation mechanism of the TRC phenomenon in the N-nutrient trade network is
due to the coexistence of the attraction of reputation in supply and demand and
the path-dependence mechanism. By understanding these mechanisms, we can
provide a new perspective on the evolution of the trade network and the
stability of the system.

modulation scheme without prior signal information and plays a vital role in
various applications, including cognitive radio and link adaptation. With the
development of deep learning (DL), DL-based AMC methods have emerged, while
most of them focus on reducing computational complexity in a centralized
structure. This centralized learning-based AMC (CentAMC) violates data privacy
in the aspect of direct transmission of client-side raw data. Federated
learning-based AMC (FedeAMC) can bypass this issue by exchanging model
parameters, but causes large resultant latency and client-side computational
load. Moreover, both CentAMC and FedeAMC are vulnerable to large-scale noise
occured in the wireless channel between the client and the server. To this end,
we develop a novel AMC method based on a split learning (SL) framework, coined
SplitAMC, that can achieve high accuracy even in poor channel conditions, while
guaranteeing data privacy and low latency. In SplitAMC, each client can benefit
from data privacy leakage by exchanging smashed data and its gradient instead
of raw data, and has robustness to noise with the help of high scale of smashed
data. Numerical evaluations validate that SplitAMC outperforms CentAMC and
FedeAMC in terms of accuracy for all SNRs as well as latency.

from low-dose scan denoising to optimisation of the reconstruction process. The
lack of datasets prevents the scalability of these methods to realistic 3D
problems. We develop a 3D procedural dataset in order to produce samples for
data-driven algorithms. It is made of a meshed model of a left hand and a
script to randomly change its anatomic properties and pose whilst conserving
realistic features. This open-source solution relies on the freeware Blender

of the hand's pose, whilst Python processes file format conversion from obj
file to matrix and functions to scale and center the volume for further
processing. Dataset availability and quality drives research in
machine-learning. We design a dataset that weighs few megabytes, provides
truthful samples and proposes continuous enhancements using version control. We
anticipate this work to be a starting point for anatomically accurate
procedural datasets. For instance, by adding more internal features and fine
tuning their X-Ray attenuation properties.

  Spill Segmentation","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2301.01202",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Effective oil spill segmentation in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is
critical for marine oil pollution cleanup, and proper image representation is
helpful for accurate image segmentation. In this paper, we propose an effective
oil spill image segmentation network named SRCNet by leveraging SAR image
representation and the training for oil spill segmentation simultaneously.
Specifically, our proposed segmentation network is constructed with a pair of
deep neural nets with the collaboration of the seminal representation that
describes SAR images, where one deep neural net is the generative net which
strives to produce oil spill segmentation maps, and the other is the
discriminative net which trys its best to distinguish between the produced and
the true segmentations, and they thus built a two-player game. Particularly,
the seminal representation exploited in our proposed SRCNet originates from SAR
imagery, modelling with the internal characteristics of SAR images. Thus, in
the training process, the collaborated seminal representation empowers the
mapped generative net to produce accurate oil spill segmentation maps
efficiently with small amount of training data, promoting the discriminative
net reaching its optimal solution at a fast speed. Therefore, our proposed
SRCNet operates effective oil spill segmentation in an economical and efficient
manner. Additionally, to increase the segmentation capability of the proposed
segmentation network in terms of accurately delineating oil spill details in
SAR images, a regularisation term that penalises the segmentation loss is
devised. This encourages our proposed SRCNet for accurately segmenting oil
spill areas from SAR images. Empirical experimental evaluations from different
metrics validate the effectiveness of our proposed SRCNet for oil spill image
segmentation.

images and videos in terms of spatial resolution and line reconstruction. We
up-sample the acquired low-resolution image through a vision-based
interpolation method; then, we train a learning-based model to improve the
quality of the up-sampling. We qualitatively and quantitatively test our model
on different anatomical districts (e.g., cardiac, obstetric) images and with
different up-sampling resolutions (i.e., 2X, 4X). Our method improves the PSNR
median value with respect to SOTA methods of $1.7\%$ on obstetric 2X raw
images, $6.1\%$ on cardiac 2X raw images, and $4.4\%$ on abdominal raw 4X
images; it also improves the number of pixels with a low prediction error of
$9.0\%$ on obstetric 4X raw images, $5.2\%$ on cardiac 4X raw images, and
$6.2\%$ on abdominal 4X raw images.
  The proposed method is then applied to the spatial super-resolution of 2D
videos, by optimising the sampling of lines acquired by the probe in terms of
the acquisition frequency. Our method specialises trained networks to predict
the high-resolution target through the design of the network architecture and
the loss function, taking into account the anatomical district and the
up-sampling factor and exploiting a large ultrasound data set. The use of deep
learning on large data sets overcomes the limitations of vision-based
algorithms that are general and do not encode the characteristics of the data.
Furthermore, the data set can be enriched with images selected by medical
experts to further specialise the individual networks. Through learning and
high-performance computing, our super-resolution is specialised to different
anatomical districts by training multiple networks. Furthermore, the
computational demand is shifted to centralised hardware resources with a
real-time execution of the network's prediction on local devices.

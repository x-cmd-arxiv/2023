oxide (rGO) on poly dimethylsiloxne membranes, are produced form monolayers of
graphene oxide assembled into densely packed sheets at an immiscible
hexane/water interface and subsequently reduced in HI vapor to increase
electrical conductivity. Pre-straining and relaxing the membranes introduces a
population of cracks into the rGO film. Subsequent straining opens these
cracks, inducing piezoresistivity. Reduction for 30 s forms an array of
parallel cracks that do not individually span the membrane and results in a
strain gauge with a usable strain range > 0.2 and gauge factor of 20 - 100 at
low strain levels that increases with increasing pre-strain. In all cases the
gauge facto decreases with increasing applied strain and asymptotes to a value
of about 3, as it approaches the pre-strain value. If the rGO is reduced for 60
s, the cracks fully span the width of the membrane, leading to an increased
gauge resistance but a much more sensitive strain gauge with GF ranging from
1000 - 16000. However, the usable strain range reduces to < 0.01. A simple
equivalent resistor model is proposed to describe the behaviour of both gauge
types. The gauges show a repeatable and stable response with loading
frequencies up to 1 kHz and have been used to detect human body motion in a
simple e-skin demonstration.

high-visibility inputs, but their performance significantly deteriorates in
extremely low-light environments. In this work, we take a deep look at instance
segmentation in the dark and introduce several techniques that substantially
boost the low-light inference accuracy. The proposed method is motivated by the
observation that noise in low-light images introduces high-frequency
disturbances to the feature maps of neural networks, thereby significantly
degrading performance. To suppress this ``feature noise"", we propose a novel
learning method that relies on an adaptive weighted downsampling layer, a
smooth-oriented convolutional block, and disturbance suppression learning.
These components effectively reduce feature noise during downsampling and
convolution operations, enabling the model to learn disturbance-invariant
features. Furthermore, we discover that high-bit-depth RAW images can better
preserve richer scene information in low-light conditions compared to typical
camera sRGB outputs, thus supporting the use of RAW-input algorithms. Our
analysis indicates that high bit-depth can be critical for low-light instance
segmentation. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated RAW datasets, we leverage a
low-light RAW synthetic pipeline to generate realistic low-light data. In
addition, to facilitate further research in this direction, we capture a
real-world low-light instance segmentation dataset comprising over two thousand
paired low/normal-light images with instance-level pixel-wise annotations.
Remarkably, without any image preprocessing, we achieve satisfactory
performance on instance segmentation in very low light (4~\% AP higher than
state-of-the-art competitors), meanwhile opening new opportunities for future
research.

hand reconstruction from a single RGB image. These approaches can be roughly
divided into model-based approaches, which are heavily dependent on the model's

achieve the robustness of model-based approaches and reduced dependence on the
model's parameter space of model-free approaches. The proposed probabilistic
model incorporates a model-based network as a prior-net to estimate the prior
probability distribution of joints and vertices. An Attention-based Mesh
Vertices Uncertainty Regression (AMVUR) model is proposed to capture
dependencies among vertices and the correlation between joints and mesh
vertices to improve their feature representation. We further propose a learning

we propose to learn the effects of macronutrition content from glucose-insulin

use a neural network to predict an individual's glucose absorption rate. We use
this neural rate function as the control function in a differential equation of
glucose dynamics, enabling end-to-end training. On simulated data, our approach
is able to closely approximate true absorption rates, resulting in better

measured using a combination of remote satellite imagery, weather stations, and
laborious point measurements and descriptions provided by local forecasters,
guides, and backcountry users. Here, we explore how characteristics of the top
layer of snowpack could be estimated while skiing using strain sensors mounted
to the top surface of an alpine ski. We show that with two strain gauges and an
inertial measurement unit it is feasible to correctly assign one of three
qualitative labels (powder, slushy, or icy/groomed snow) to each 10 second

Comparisons of classifier performance between strain gauges suggest that the
optimal placement of strain gauges is halfway between the binding and the
tip/tail of the ski, in the cambered section just before the point where the
unweighted ski would touch the snow surface. The ability to classify snow,
potentially in real-time, using skis opens the door to applications that range

metrics that align with human judgment. Token-matching-based metrics, such as
BLEU, have demonstrated weak correlations with human practitioners in code
generation tasks. Moreover, the utilization of human-written test suites to

based on the GPT-3.5 (\texttt{GPT-3.5-turbo}), for code generation assessments.
Our framework addresses the limitations of existing approaches by achieving
superior correlations with functional correctness and human preferences,
without the need for test oracles or references. We evaluate the efficacy of
our framework on two different tasks and four programming languages, comparing
its performance with the state-of-the-art CodeBERTScore metric, which relies on

their ability to independently search for relevant information to ground a

query generation models that communicate with external search APIs to ground
dialog responses. Unlike previous approaches which relied on human written
dialogs with search queries, our method allows to automatically generate
query-based grounded dialogs with better control and scale. Our experiments
demonstrate that: (1) For query generation on the QReCC dataset, models trained
on our synthetically-generated data achieve 90%--97% of the performance of
models trained on the human-generated data; (2) We can successfully generate
data for training dialog models in new domains without any existing dialog data

there are gradients in stress. Internal stress variations in minerals create
gradients in strain energy which will drive diffusion. Consequently, it is
necessary to have a method that incorporates stress variations into diffusion
models. We derive a flux expression that allows diffusion to be modeled in
ionic, crystalline solids under arbitrary stress states. Our derivation
utilizes gradients in a thermodynamic potential called relative chemical
potential which quantifies changes in free energy due to the exchanges of
constituents on lattice sites under arbitrary stress conditions. We apply our
derivation to the common quaternary garnet solid solution
almandine-pyrope-grossular-spessartine. The rates and directions of divalent
cation diffusion in response to stress are determined by endmember molar volume

parameters. Our results predict that internal stress variations of one hundred

hundredths of a mole fraction. Mineral inclusions in garnet present a potential
environment to test and apply our stress-driven diffusion approach, as stress
variations ranging from hundreds of MPa to GPa-level are observed or predicted
around such inclusions. The ability to model stress-induced diffusion may
provide new information about the magnitudes of both intracrystalline stresses

the algebraically decaying stationary solution $\phi_0$ as well as
exponentially decaying standing waves $e^{i\omega t}\phi_\omega(x)$ with
$\omega>0$. It is well-known from the general theory that stability properties
of standing waves are determined by the derivative of $\omega\mapsto
M(\omega):=\frac{1}{2}\|\phi_\omega\|_{L^2}^2$; namely $e^{i\omega

$M'(\omega)<0$. However, the stability/instability of stationary solutions is
outside the general theory from the viewpoint of spectral properties of
linearized operators. In this paper we prove the instability of the stationary
solution $\phi_0$ in one dimension under the condition
$M'(0):=\lim_{\omega\downarrow 0}M'(\omega)\in[-\infty, 0)$. The key in the
proof is the construction of the one-sided derivative of

construct the unstable direction of $\phi_0$.

detection methods (LiDAR and camera candidates, transformation, and fusion
outputs), we observe that all existing methods either find dense candidates or
yield dense representations of scenes. However, given that objects occupy only
a small part of a scene, finding dense candidates and generating dense
representations is noisy and inefficient. We propose SparseFusion, a novel
multi-sensor 3D detection method that exclusively uses sparse candidates and
sparse representations. Specifically, SparseFusion utilizes the outputs of
parallel detectors in the LiDAR and camera modalities as sparse candidates for
fusion. We transform the camera candidates into the LiDAR coordinate space by
disentangling the object representations. Then, we can fuse the multi-modality
candidates in a unified 3D space by a lightweight self-attention module. To
mitigate negative transfer between modalities, we propose novel semantic and
geometric cross-modality transfer modules that are applied prior to the
modality-specific detectors. SparseFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance
on the nuScenes benchmark while also running at the fastest speed, even
outperforming methods with stronger backbones. We perform extensive experiments

operate a cryptanalytically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) in terms of rather

not been any estimates of these requirements in terms of more familiar economic
resources like money or electricity. We demonstrate that the electrical energy
required to break one cryptographic public key can be decomposed into the
product of two factors. There is an extensive literature of previous estimates
for one factor, the spacetime volume, that range over about six orders of
magnitude; we discuss some interesting patterns in these estimates. We could
not find any quantitative estimates at all for the other factor, the average
power consumption per qubit. By combining several data points from existing
superconducting-transmon quantum computers and extrapolating them to enormously
larger scales, we make an extremely rough estimate of a plausible value of
about six watts/qubit consumed by an eventual superconducting-transmon CRQC. By
combining this estimate with a plausible spacetime volume estimate of $5.9
\times 10^6$ qubit-days from the prior literature, we estimate that - even
after expending the enormous costs to build a CRQC - running it would require
about 125 MW of electrical power, and using it to break one public key would
cost about \$64,000 for electricity alone at current prices. Even if a CRQC is
eventually built, merely operating it would probably remain the domain of
nation-states and large organizations for a significant period of time.

developed to cope with the actuator fault. Firstly, a nonlinear model of the
quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is presented. Then, the controller
design and type of the actuator fault are explained. The control allocation
algorithm is used to optimize the trajectory tracking performance of the

is an effective approach to implementing fault-tolerant control. When actuator
faults are identified, they can be modeled as changes in the B matrix of
constraints. Various simulations have been made for situations with and without
actuator failure. In normal conditions, the quadrotor can accurately track
altitude, roll, pitch and yaw references. In faulty conditions, the quadrotor
can follow the references with a small error. Simulations prove the
effectiveness of the control allocation algorithm, which stabilizes the

body $K$ and associates to these canonical $L^p$-polar bodies $K^{\circ, p}$
and Mahler volumes $\mathcal{M}_p(K)$. Classical polarity is then seen as
$L^\infty$-polarity. This one-parameter generalization of polarity leads to a
generalization of the Mahler conjectures, with a subtle advantage over the
original conjecture: conjectural uniqueness of extremizers for each
$p\in(0,\infty)$. We settle the upper bound by demonstrating the existence and
uniqueness of an $L^p$-Santal\'o point and an $L^p$-Santal\'o inequality for
symmetric convex bodies. The proof uses Ball's Brunn--Minkowski inequality for
harmonic means, the classical Brunn--Minkowski inequality, symmetrization, and
a systematic study of the $\mathcal{M}_p$ functionals. Using our results on the
$L^p$-Santal\'o point and a new observation motivated by complex geometry, we
show how Bourgain's slicing conjecture can be reduced to lower bounds on the
$L^p$-Mahler volume coupled with a certain conjectural convexity property of
the logarithm of the Monge--Amp\`ere measure of the $L^p$-support function. We
derive a suboptimal version of this convexity using Kobayashi's theorem on the
Ricci curvature of Bergman metrics to illustrate this approach to slicing.
Finally, we explain how Nazarov's complex analytic approach to the classical
Mahler conjecture is instead precisely an approach to the $L^1$-Mahler
conjecture.

  Guardrail Models for Virtual Assistants",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A wave of new task-based virtual assistants has been fueled by increasingly
powerful large language models, such as GPT-4. These conversational agents can
be customized to serve customer-specific use cases, but ensuring that
agent-generated text conforms to designer-specified rules included in prompt
instructions alone is challenging. Therefore, chatbot designers often use
another model, called a guardrail model, to verify that the agent output aligns
with their rules and constraints. We explore using a distillation approach to
guardrail models to monitor the output of the first model using training data
from GPT-4. We find two crucial steps to our CONSCENDI process:
scenario-augmented generation and contrastive training examples. When
generating conversational data, we generate a set of rule-breaking scenarios,
which enumerate a diverse set of high-level ways a rule can be violated. This
scenario-guided approach produces a diverse training set of rule-violating
conversations, and it provides chatbot designers greater control over the
classification process. We also prompt GPT-4 to also generate contrastive
examples by altering conversations with violations into acceptable
conversations. This set of borderline, contrastive examples enables the
distilled model to learn finer-grained distinctions between what is acceptable
and what is not. We find that CONSCENDI results in guardrail models that
improve over baselines.

generalizable PDE dynamics from motion observations. Many NN approaches learn
an end-to-end model that implicitly models both the governing PDE and
constitutive models (or material models). Without explicit PDE knowledge, these
approaches cannot guarantee physical correctness and have limited
generalizability. We argue that the governing PDEs are often well-known and
should be explicitly enforced rather than learned. Instead, constitutive models
are particularly suitable for learning due to their data-fitting nature. To
this end, we introduce a new framework termed ""Neural Constitutive Laws""
(NCLaw), which utilizes a network architecture that strictly guarantees
standard constitutive priors, including rotation equivariance and undeformed
state equilibrium. We embed this network inside a differentiable simulation and
train the model by minimizing a loss function based on the difference between
the simulation and the motion observation. We validate NCLaw on various
large-deformation dynamical systems, ranging from solids to fluids. After
training on a single motion trajectory, our method generalizes to new
geometries, initial/boundary conditions, temporal ranges, and even
multi-physics systems. On these extremely out-of-distribution generalization
tasks, NCLaw is orders-of-magnitude more accurate than previous NN approaches.
Real-world experiments demonstrate our method's ability to learn constitutive

estimation precision with a limited number of $N$ resources used (e.g., atoms,
photons, etc.). Using entangled quantum states makes it possible to scale the
precision with $N$ better than when resources would be used independently.
Consequently, the optimal use of all resources involves accumulating them in a
single execution of the experiment. Unfortunately, that implies that the most
common theoretical tool used to analyze metrological protocols - quantum Fisher
information (QFI) - does not allow for a reliable description of this problem,
as it becomes operationally meaningful only with multiple repetitions of the
experiment. In this thesis, using the formalism of Bayesian estimation and the
minimax estimator, I derive asymptotically saturable bounds on the precision of
the estimation for the case of noiseless unitary evolution. For the case where
the number of resources $N$ is strictly constrained, I show that the final
measurement uncertainty is $\pi$ times larger than would be implied by a naive
use of QFI. I also analyze the case where a constraint is imposed only on the
average amount of resources, the exact value of which may fluctuate (in which
case QFI does not provide any universal bound for precision). In both cases, I
study the asymptotic saturability and the rate of convergence of these bounds.
In the following part, I analyze the problem of the Heisenberg limit when
multiple parameters are measured simultaneously on the same physical system. In
particular, I investigate the existence of a gain from measuring all parameters
simultaneously compared to distributing the same amount of resources to measure
them independently. I focus on two examples - the measurement of multiple phase
shifts in a multi-arm interferometer and the measurement of three magnetic
field components.

channel distribution of all possible mobile terminals (MTs) located inside the

based on one GMM component. By extracting directional information of the
constructed codebook, the proposed GMM-based feedback approach allows to
jointly design the precoders of a multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) system using common
precoding algorithms. Alternatively, the GMM's sample generation ability can be
utilized to design the precoders using a state-of-the-art stochastic iterative
algorithm. After offloading the GMM to the MTs, they determine their feedback
simply as the index of the GMM component with the highest responsibility for
their received pilot signal. This strategy exhibits low complexity and allows
for parallelization. Simulation results show that the proposed approach

setting prices of products in sequential rounds, the seller also ex-ante
commits to 'advertising schemes'. That is, in the beginning of each round the
seller can decide what kind of signal they will provide to the buyer about the
product's quality upon realization. Using the popular Bayesian persuasion
framework to model the effect of these signals on the buyers' valuation and
purchase responses, we formulate the problem of finding an optimal design of
the advertising scheme along with a pricing scheme that maximizes the seller's
expected revenue. Without any apriori knowledge of the buyers' demand function,
our goal is to design an online algorithm that can use past purchase responses
to adaptively learn the optimal pricing and advertising strategy. We study the
regret of the algorithm when compared to the optimal clairvoyant price and
advertising scheme.
  Our main result is a computationally efficient online algorithm that achieves
an $O(T^{2/3}(m\log T)^{1/3})$ regret bound when the valuation function is
linear in the product quality. Here $m$ is the cardinality of the discrete
product quality domain and $T$ is the time horizon. This result requires some
natural monotonicity and Lipschitz assumptions on the valuation function, but
no Lipschitz or smoothness assumption on the buyers' demand function. For
constant $m$, our result matches the regret lower bound for dynamic pricing
within logarithmic factors, which is a special case of our problem. We also
obtain several improved results for the widely considered special case of
additive valuations, including an $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret bound independent
of $m$ when $m\le T^{1/3}$.

the fraction of haloes living in various CW components to be a function of
their mass, with the majority of the haloes of mass below $10^{12}M_{\odot}/h$,
residing in voids and haloes of higher masses distributed mostly in walls.
Similarly, in the Stellar-to-Halo mass relationship, we observe an
environmental dependence for haloes of masses below $10^{12}M_{\odot}/h$,
showing an increased stellar mass fraction for the densest environments.
  The spin is lower for galaxies in the densest environments for the mass range

metallicity fractions for filaments and node galaxies, with respect to the full

expressivity of QSP/QSVT protocols where circuit manipulation maps naturally to
the algebraic manipulation of functional transforms (termed semantic

However, practical manufacturing applications remain extremely difficult for

conditions (e.g., only normal operating data). Furthermore, models often
encounter shifts in domain as process parameters change and new categories of
faults emerge. Traditional supervised learning may struggle to learn compact,
discriminative representations that generalize to these unseen target domains
since it depends on having plentiful classes to partition the feature space
with decision boundaries. Transfer Learning (TL) with domain adaptation
attempts to adapt these models to unlabeled target domains but assumes similar
underlying structure that may not be present if new faults emerge. This study
proposes focusing on maximizing the feature generality on the source domain and
applying TL via weight transfer to copy the model to the target domain.
Specifically, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) with Barlow Twins may produce more
discriminative features for monitoring health condition than supervised
learning by focusing on semantic properties of the data. Furthermore, Federated
Learning (FL) for distributed training may also improve generalization by
efficiently expanding the effective size and diversity of training data by
sharing information across multiple client machines. Results show that Barlow
Twins outperforms supervised learning in an unlabeled target domain with

diversity of synthesized content. To harness the expressive power of diffusion
models, researchers have explored various controllable mechanisms that allow
users to intuitively guide the content synthesis process. Although the latest
efforts have primarily focused on video synthesis, there has been a lack of
effective methods for controlling and describing desired content and motion. In
response to this gap, we introduce MCDiff, a conditional diffusion model that
generates a video from a starting image frame and a set of strokes, which allow
users to specify the intended content and dynamics for synthesis. To tackle the
ambiguity of sparse motion inputs and achieve better synthesis quality, MCDiff
first utilizes a flow completion model to predict the dense video motion based
on the semantic understanding of the video frame and the sparse motion control.
Then, the diffusion model synthesizes high-quality future frames to form the
output video. We qualitatively and quantitatively show that MCDiff achieves the
state-the-of-art visual quality in stroke-guided controllable video synthesis.
Additional experiments on MPII Human Pose further exhibit the capability of our

gravitational field of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), are being observed at
a high rate owing to the advanced state of survey science. One of the
properties of TDEs that is measured with increasing statistical reliability is
the TDE luminosity function, $d\dot{N}_{\rm TDE}/dL$, which is the TDE rate per
luminosity (i.e., how many TDEs are within a given luminosity range). Here we
show that if the luminous emission from a TDE is directly coupled to the rate
of return of tidally destroyed debris to the SMBH, then the TDE luminosity
function is in good agreement with observations and scales as $\propto
L^{-2.5}$ for high luminosities, provided that the SMBH mass function
$dN_{\bullet}/dM_{\bullet}$ -- the number of SMBHs ($N_{\bullet}$) per SMBH
mass ($M_{\bullet}$) -- is approximately flat in the mass range over which we
observe TDEs. We also show that there is a cutoff in the luminosity function at
low luminosities that is a result of direct captures, and this cutoff has been
tentatively observed. If $dN_{\bullet}/dM_{\bullet}$ is flat, which is in
agreement with some observational campaigns, these results suggest that the
fallback rate feeds the accretion rate in TDEs. Contrarily, if
$dN_{\bullet}/d\log M_{\bullet}$ is flat, which has been found theoretically
and is suggested by other observational investigations, then the emission from
TDEs is likely powered by another mechanism. Future observations and more TDE
statistics, provided by the Rubin Observatory/LSST, will provide additional

inspiral gravitational waves. Next, we formulate general gravitational-wave
propagation and point out that the energy flux hardly changes through
propagation as long as the background changes slowly compared to the wavelength

mass segregation, indicative of dynamical-friction-driven orbital decay, which
opens the possibility of using imaging data alone to constrain the dark-matter
content of the galaxy. To explore this possibility, we develop a
semi-analytical model of GC evolution, which starts from the initial mass
function, the initial structure-mass relation, and the initial spatial
distribution of the GC progenitors, and follows the effects of dynamical
friction, tidal evolution, and two-body relaxation. Using Markov Chain Monte
Carlo, we forward-model the GCs in a NGC5846-UDG1-like potential to match the
observed GC mass, size, and spatial distributions, and to constrain the profile
of the host halo and the origin of the GCs. We find that, with the assumptions
of zero mass segregation when the star clusters were born, NGC5846-UDG1 is
dark-matter poor compared to what is expected from stellar-to-halo-mass
relations, and its halo concentration is low, irrespective of having a cuspy or
a cored halo profile. Its GC population has an initial spatial distribution
more extended than the smooth stellar distribution. We discuss the results in
the context of scaling laws of galaxy-halo connections, and warn against
naively using the GC-abundance-halo-mass relation to infer the halo mass of
UDGs. Our model is generally applicable to GC-rich dwarf galaxies, and is

$\Omega_\Lambda$, independently of any other currently used probe. The
properties of $\rm \rho_{ta}$ predicted by the spherical collapse model were
also shown to persist in the presence of full three-dimensional effects in $\rm

the present time, $z=0$. However, a small offset was discovered between the
spherical-collapse prediction of the value of $\rho_{ta}$ at $z=0$ and its
value measured in simulations. In this letter, we explore whether this offset
evolves with cosmic time; whether it differs in different cosmologies; whether
its origin can be confidently identified; and whether it can be corrected. We
found that the offset does evolve slightly with redshift, and that it
correlates strongly with the deviation from spherical symmetry of the dark
matter halo distribution inside and outside of the turnaround radius. We used
an appropriate metric to quantify deviations in the environment of a structure
from spherical symmetry. We found that using this metric, we can construct a
sphericity-selected sample of halos for which the offset of $\rho_{ta}$ from
the spherical collapse prediction is zero, independently of redshift and

discovery of exotic physical phenomena is a non-trivial task. The challenge
becomes even greater with next-generation colliders that will produce even more

motivates the search for unsupervised anomaly detection methods that do not

such a technique. More explicitly, we employ a quantum generative adversarial

by forming a dative bond with O, while, in some cases, it can weaken the
ad-sorption of O2, compared to the undoped diamond. Moreover, a noticeable
displacement of the surface atoms attached to the fragment of the dissociated

of wear at the atomistic level. These qualitative and quantitative results aim

When maintaining the system out of equilibrium by wet-dry cycles, the cycle

small masses for the active neutrinos $(m_\nu)$. In these mechanisms $m_\nu$ is
inversely proportional to the lepton number breaking scale $(M)$ that, in the
particular case of the type I seesaw mechanism, is the Majorana mass of the
right-handed neutrinos. In the canonical case right-handed neutrinos are
supposed to be heavy belonging to the GUT scale. With the advent of the LHC
people began to suppose these neutrinos having mass at TeV scale. In this case
very tiny Yukawa couplings are required. As far as we know there are no
constraints on the energy scales associated to the seesaw mechanisms. In what
concern 3-3-1 models, when we trigger the type I seesaw mechanism the lepton
number breaking scale that suppresses active neutrino masses contributes to the
masses of the standard gauge bosons. Current data on $m_W$ demands the
mechanism to be performed at GeV scale. As main implication we may have right
handed neutrinos with mass varying from few keVs up to hundreds of GeVs. We
also investigate the viability of the mechanism and found as interesting result
that in the case in which the right-handed neutrino masses belong to the range
keV-MeV scale, viability of the mechanism demands that the lightest of the
right-handed neutrinos be stable, which makes of it a natural dark matter
candidate, and that the lightest of the active neutrinos be much lighter than
the other two active neutrinos.

model that solves the task in three stages. First, our model leverages recent
advanced autoencoding language models to produce contextual word embeddings,
which are then combined with character-level and POS-tag information to form
word representations. Next, bidirectional long short-term memory networks are
employed to capture the relations among words and generate sentence-level
representations. At the third stage, borrowing ideas from graph-based
dependency parsing methods which provide a global view on the input sentence,
we use biaffine classifiers to estimate the probability of each pair of
start-end words to be an important segment. Experimental results on a public
Vietnamese legal dataset show that our model outperforms the previous work by a
large margin, achieving 94.79% in the F1 score. The results also prove the
effectiveness of using contextual features extracted from pre-trained language
models combined with other types of features such as character-level and

results of the largest high-resolution spectroscopic H$\alpha$ emission survey
to date spanning this transition region, including 480 M dwarfs observed using
the CHIRON spectrograph at CTIO/SMARTS 1.5-m. We find that M dwarfs with
H$\alpha$ in emission are almost entirely found 0 to 0.5 magnitude above the
top edge of the gap in the HRD, whereas effectively no stars in and below the
gap show emission. Thus, the top edge of the gap marks a relatively sharp
activity transition and there is no anomalous H$\alpha$ activity for stars in
the gap. We also identify a new region at 10.3 $<M_{G}<$ 10.8 on the main
sequence where fewer M dwarfs exhibit H$\alpha$ emission compared to M dwarfs
above and below this magnitude range. Careful evaluation of literature results
indicates that 1) rotation and H$\alpha$ activity distributions on the main
sequence are closely related, and 2) fewer stars in this absolute magnitude
range rotate in less than $\sim$13 days than populations surrounding this
region. This result suggests that the most massive fully convective stars lose
their angular momentum faster than both partially convective stars and less
massive fully convective stars.

another 1.93 meV. The calculated bulk band structure consists of two electron
bands ({\alpha} and \b{eta}) and two hole bands ({\gamma} and {\eta}) at the

several vehicles in a single image, we introduce the concept of augmentation
which highlights the region of interest containing the vehicles. The augmented
map is generated by exploring the combination of multiresolution analysis and
maximally stable extremal regions (MR-MSER). The output of MR-MSER is supplied
to fast CNN to generate a confidence map, which results in candidate regions.
Furthermore, unlike existing models that implement complicated models for
vehicle detection, we explore the combination of a rough set and fuzzy-based
models for robust vehicle detection. To show the effectiveness of the proposed
method, we conduct experiments on our dataset captured by drones and on several
vehicle detection benchmark datasets, namely, KITTI and UA-DETRAC. The results
on our dataset and the benchmark datasets show that the proposed method
outperforms the existing methods in terms of time efficiency and achieves a
good detection rate.

incorporating the estimated attack parameters into the detection process.
First, we propose the generalized likelihood ratio test with reference sensors
(GLRTRS) and the locally most powerful test with reference sensors (LMPTRS)
detectors with adaptive thresholds, given that the sparsity degree and the
attack parameters are unknown. Our simulation results show that the LMPTRS and
GLRTRS detectors outperform the LMPT and GLRT detectors proposed for an
attack-free environment and are more robust against attacks. The proposed
detectors can achieve the detection performance close to the benchmark
likelihood ratio test (LRT) detector, which has perfect knowledge of the attack
parameters and sparsity degree. When the fraction of Byzantine nodes are
assumed to be known, we can further improve the system's detection performance.
We propose the enhanced LMPTRS (E-LMPTRS) and enhanced GLRTRS (E-GLRTRS)
detectors by filtering out potential malicious sensors with the knowledge of
the fraction of Byzantine nodes in the network. Simulation results show the

challenges to dynamical models of solar system origin and evolution. To
characterize the orbit pole distribution of dynamical groups of small bodies it
helps to have a functional form for a model of the distribution function.
Previous studies have used the small-inclination approximation and adopted
variations of the normal distribution to model orbital inclination dispersions.
Because the orbital pole is a directional variable, its distribution can be
more appropriately modeled with directional statistics. We describe the von
Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on the surface of the unit sphere for
application to small bodies' orbital poles. We apply it to the orbit pole
distribution of the observed Plutinos. We find a mean pole located at
inclination of 3.57 degrees and a longitude of ascending node of 124.38 degrees
(in the J2000 reference frame), with a 99.7 per cent confidence cone of
half-angle 1.68 degrees. We also estimate a debiased mean pole located 4.6
degrees away, at an inclination of 2.26 degrees and a longitude of ascending
node of 292.69 degrees, of similar-size confidence cone. The vMF concentration
parameter of Plutino inclinations (relative to either mean pole estimate) is
31.6. This resembles a Rayleigh distribution function with a width parameter of
10.2 degrees. Unlike previous models, the vMF model naturally accommodates all
physical inclinations (and no others), whereas Rayleigh or Gaussian models must
be truncated to the physical inclination range 0-180 degrees. Further work is
needed to produce a theory for the mean pole of the Plutinos against which to
compare the observational results.

unprecedentedly large field of view (204 deg$^2$) and NUV (230-290nm)
sensitivity (22.5 mag, 5$\sigma$, at 900s). ULTRASAT will conduct the first
wide-field survey of transient and variable NUV sources and will revolutionize
our ability to study the hot transient universe: It will explore a new
parameter space in energy and time-scale (months long light-curves with minutes
cadence), with an extra-Galactic volume accessible for the discovery of
transient sources that is $>$300 times larger than that of GALEX and comparable
to that of LSST. ULTRASAT data will be transmitted to the ground in real-time,
and transient alerts will be distributed to the community in $<$15 min,
enabling a vigorous ground-based follow-up of ULTRASAT sources. ULTRASAT will
also provide an all-sky NUV image to $>$23.5 AB mag, over 10 times deeper than
the GALEX map. Two key science goals of ULTRASAT are the study of mergers of
binaries involving neutron stars, and supernovae: With a large fraction
($>$50%) of the sky instantaneously accessible, fast (minutes) slewing
capability and a field-of-view that covers the error ellipses expected from GW
detectors beyond 2025, ULTRASAT will rapidly detect the electromagnetic
emission following BNS/NS-BH mergers identified by GW detectors, and will
provide continuous NUV light-curves of the events; ULTRASAT will provide early
(hour) detection and continuous high (minutes) cadence NUV light curves for
hundreds of core-collapse supernovae, including for rarer supernova progenitor
types.

learn new information (classes) sequentially, while also retaining the
previously acquired information (classes). However, it has been shown that such
approaches are extremely vulnerable to the adversarial backdoor attacks, where
an intelligent adversary can introduce small amount of misinformation to the
model in the form of imperceptible backdoor pattern during training to cause
deliberate forgetting of a specific task or class at test time. In this work,
we propose a novel defensive framework to counter such an insidious attack
where, we use the attacker's primary strength-hiding the backdoor pattern by
making it imperceptible to humans-against it, and propose to learn a
perceptible (stronger) pattern (also during the training) that can overpower
the attacker's imperceptible (weaker) pattern. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed defensive mechanism through various commonly used Replay-based
(both generative and exact replay-based) class incremental learning algorithms
using continual learning benchmark variants of CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST
datasets. Most noteworthy, our proposed defensive framework does not assume
that the attacker's target task and target class is known to the defender. The
defender is also unaware of the shape, size, and location of the attacker's
pattern. We show that our proposed defensive framework considerably improves
the performance of class incremental learning algorithms with no knowledge of
the attacker's target task, attacker's target class, and attacker's
imperceptible pattern. We term our defensive framework as Adversary Aware

is injected into a weakly interacting one-dimensional Bose condensate. While
for small impurity-boson couplings this process can be described within the
Froehlich model as generation, emission and binding of Bogoliubov phonons, this
is no longer adequate if the coupling becomes strong. To treat this regime we
consider a mean-field approach beyond the Froehlich model which accounts for
the backaction to the condensate, complemented with Truncated Wigner
simulations to include quantum fluctuation. For the stationary polaron we find
an energy-momentum relation that displays a smooth crossover from a convex to a
concave dependence associated with a non-monotonous relation between impurity
velocity and polaron momentum. For larger momenta the energy is a periodic
function including regions of negative impurity velocity. Studying the polaron
formation after turning on the impurity-boson coupling quasi adiabatically and
in a sudden quench, we find a very rich scenario of dynamical regimes. Due to
the build-up of an effective mass, the impurity is slowed down even if its
initial velocity is below the Landau critical value. For larger initial
velocities we find deceleration and even backscattering caused by emission of
density waves or grey solitons and subsequent formation of stationary polaron
states in different momentum sectors. In order to analyze the effect of quantum
fluctuations we consider a trapped condensate to avoid 1D infrared
divergencies. Using Truncated Wigner simulations in this case we show under
what conditions the influence of quantum fluctuations is small.

both scientific research and clinical studies. Precise segmentation of brain
tumors facilitates clinical diagnosis, evaluations, and surgical planning. Deep
learning has recently emerged to improve brain tumor segmentation and achieved
impressive results. Convolutional architectures are widely used to implement
those neural networks. By the nature of limited receptive fields, however,
those architectures are subject to representing long-range spatial dependencies
of the voxel intensities in MRI images. Transformers have been leveraged
recently to address the above limitations of convolutional networks.
Unfortunately, the majority of current Transformers-based methods in
segmentation are performed with 2D MRI slices, instead of 3D volumes. Moreover,
it is difficult to incorporate the structures between layers because each head
is calculated independently in the Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism (MHSA).
In this work, we proposed a 3D Transformer-based segmentation approach. We
developed a Fusion-Head Self-Attention mechanism (FHSA) to combine each
attention head through attention logic and weight mapping, for the exploration
of the long-range spatial dependencies in 3D MRI images. We implemented a
plug-and-play self-attention module, named the Infinite Deformable Fusion

We applied our approach to the task of brain tumor segmentation, and assessed
it on the public BRATS datasets. The experimental results demonstrated that our

main focus in the context of referential games and variants, as it promises to
enable greater systematicity to the agents which would wield it. The concept of
disentanglement has been shown to be of paramount importance to learned
representations that generalise well in deep learning, and is thought to be a
necessary condition to enable systematicity. Thus, this paper investigates how
do compositionality at the level of the emerging languages, disentanglement at
the level of the learned representations, and systematicity relate to each
other in the context of visual referential games. Firstly, we find that visual
referential games that are based on the Obverter architecture outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised learning approach in terms of many major
disentanglement metrics. Secondly, we expand the previously proposed Positional
Disentanglement (PosDis) metric for compositionality to (re-)incorporate some
concerns pertaining to informativeness and completeness features found in the
Mutual Information Gap (MIG) disentanglement metric it stems from. This
extension allows for further discrimination between the different kind of
compositional languages that emerge in the context of Obverter-based
referential games, in a way that neither the referential game accuracy nor
previous metrics were able to capture. Finally we investigate whether the
resulting (emergent) systematicity, as measured by zero-shot compositional
learning tests, correlates with any of the disentanglement and compositionality
metrics proposed so far. Throughout the training process, statically
significant correlation coefficients can be found both positive and negative

gradient across the drop and is driven by the surface tension variations at the
free drop interface. Using the analytical basis for the solutions of Stokes
equation in coordinates of oblate spheroid we have derived the linearly
independent stationary solutions for Marangoni convection in terms of Stokes
stream functions. The numerical simulations of the thermocapillary motion in
the drops are used to study the onset of the stationary regime. Both analytical
and numerical calculations predict the axially-symmetric circulatory convection
motion in the drop, the dynamics of which is determined by the magnitude of the
temperature gradient across the drop. The analytical solutions for the critical
temperature distribution and velocity fields are obtained for the large
temperature gradients across the oblate drop. These solutions reveal the
lateral separation of the critical and stationary motions within the drops. The
critical vortices are localized near the central part of a drop, while the
intensive stationary flow is located closer to its butt end. A crossover to the

by reducing the droplet ellipticity ratio to zero value. The initial stationary
regime for the strongly oblate drops becomes unstable relative to the

a variation on the two-dimensional, two-component (2D-2C) PIV to access flows

renders silicon less attractive material for a wide range of optoelectronic
applications. In this work, we introduce an alternative mechanism to fulfill
the momentum-matching criterion for optical excitations in indirect

just below ~3 nm, photons acquire sufficient momentum to allow electronic
transitions without the assistance of a phonon. In such arrangement, both
energy and momentum can be conserved with two particles only, a photon and an
electron, converting previously indirect transitions into direct. This

High-dimensional Clustering onto Hamiltonian Cycle (HCHC) to solve the above
problems. First, HCHC combines global structure with local structure in one

probabilities, to mine the similarities between different clusters while
keeping the local structure in each cluster. Then, the anchors of different
clusters are sorted on the optimal Hamiltonian cycle generated by the cluster
similarities and mapped on the circumference of a circle. Finally, a sample
with a higher probability of a cluster will be mapped closer to the
corresponding anchor. In this way, our framework allows us to appreciate three
aspects visually and simultaneously - clusters (formed by samples with high
probabilities), cluster similarities (represented as circular distances), and
outliers (recognized as dots far away from all clusters). The experiments

minimizing the distortion in the state. In contrast, the policy network updates
its parameters to minimize the effect of perturbation while maximizing the
expected future reward. Based on this objective, we propose a practical deep

These errors are often detected during subsequent data collection and
verification. Questions remain about whether to use the mis-reported initial
stratification or the corrected values in subsequent analyses. It is shown that
the likelihood function resulting from the design of randomized clinical trials
supports the use of the corrected values. New definitions are proposed that
characterize misclassification errors as `ignorable' and `non-ignorable'.
Ignorable errors may depend on the correct strata and any other modeled
baseline covariates, but they are otherwise unrelated to potential treatment
outcomes. Data management review suggests most misclassification errors are
arbitrarily produced by distracted investigators, so they are ignorable or at
most weakly dependent on measured and unmeasured baseline covariates. Ignorable
misclassification errors may produce a small increase in standard errors, but
other properties of the planned analyses are unchanged (e.g., unbiasedness,
confidence interval coverage). It is shown that unbiased linear estimation in
the absence of misclassification errors remains unbiased when there are
non-ignorable misclassification errors, and the corresponding confidence

  To mitigate the limitation, we propose a greybox penetration testing approach

without requiring the access of complete IAM configurations. The idea is to
intelligently query a limited amount of information that is only related to IAM
privilege escalation detection. Cloud customers are allowed to specify which

augmented estimator collapses to OLS alone. We then extend these results to
specific choices of outcome and weighting models. We first show that the
combined estimator that uses (kernel) ridge regression for both outcome and
weighting models is equivalent to a single, undersmoothed (kernel) ridge
regression; this also holds when considering asymptotic rates. When the
weighting model is instead lasso regression, we give closed-form expressions
for special cases and demonstrate a ``double selection'' property. Finally, we
generalize these results to linear estimands via the Riesz representer. Our
framework ``opens the black box'' on these increasingly popular estimators and
provides important insights into estimation choices for augmented balancing
weights.

sub-networks, i.e. slices on a shared physical infrastructure. Unlike
traditional one-size-fits-all resource provisioning schemes, each network slice
(NS) in 5G is tailored to the specific service requirements of a group of
customers. An end-to-end (E2E) mobile NS orchestration requires the
simultaneous provisioning of computing, storage, and networking resources
across the core network (CN) and the radio access network (RAN). Constant
temporospatial changes in mobile user demand profiles further complicate the
E2E NSs resource provisioning beyond the limits of the existing best-effort
schemes that are only effective under accurate demand forecasts for all slices.
This paper proposes a practical two-time-scale resource provisioning framework
for E2E network slicing under demand uncertainty. At each macro-scale instance,
we assume that only the spatial probability distribution of the NS demands is
available. We formulate the NSs resource allocation problem as a stochastic
mixed integer program (SMIP) with the objective of minimizing the total
resource cost at the CN and the RAN. At each microscale instance, utilizing the
exact slice demand profiles, a linear program is solved to jointly minimize the
unsupported traffic and the resource cost at the RAN. We verify the
effectiveness of our resource allocation scheme through numerical experiments.

approaches. Finally, to test these approaches, we implemented a simulator in

potential flow simulations of a near-ground pitching hydrofoil. It is
discovered that previously observed stable and unstable equilibrium altitudes
are generated by a balance between positive wake-induced lift and negative
quasi-steady lift while the added mass lift doesn't play a role. Using both
simulations and experiments, detailed analyses of each lift component's
near-ground behavior provide further physical insights. When applied to
three-dimensional pitching hydrofoils the lift decomposition reveals that the
disappearance of equilibrium altitudes for AR < 1.5 occurs due to the magnitude
of the quasi-steady lift outweighing the magnitude of the wake-induced lift at
all ground distances. Scaling laws for the quasi-steady lift, wake-induced lift
and the stable equilibrium altitude are discovered. A simple scaling law for
the lift of a steady foil in ground effect is derived. This scaling shows that
both circulation enhancement and the velocity induced at a foil's leading edge
by the bound vortex of its ground image foil are the essential physics to
understand steady ground effect. The scaling laws for unsteady pitching foils
can predict the equilibrium altitude to within 20% of its value when St < 0.45.
For St equal to or greater than 0.45 there is a wake instability effect, not
accounted for in the scaling relations, that significantly alters the
wake-induced lift. These results not only provide key physical insights and
scaling laws for steady and unsteady ground effect, but also for two schooling
hydrofoils in a side-by-side formation with an out-of-phase synchronization.

star-forming companions have sSFRs that are enhanced (on average) by a factor
of $2.9 \pm 0.3$ in TNG100-1 and $2.27 \pm 0.06$ in TNG300-1 compared to
controls, with enhancements present out to separations of $\sim 300$ kpc.
Galaxies with passive companions in TNG300-1 exhibit mild sSFR suppression
($\sim12$ percent) at 100-300 kpc and small sSFR enhancements at separations
below 50 kpc. sSFR suppression is strongest in pairs where the galaxy's stellar
mass is more than 2 times that of its passive companion. By generating a
stellar mass-matched (""twinned"") sample in TNG300-1, we show that differences
in sSFR trends between companion types are not a result of intrinsic stellar
mass differences in star-forming vs. passive galaxies. We compare with an
analogous sample of galaxy pairs from SDSS, finding consistent results between
observations and simulations. Overall, we find that star-forming galaxies show
enhanced sSFRs regardless of companion type, but that galaxies with close
passive companions are more likely to be passive themselves.

impact of uncertainty is well understood. However, its computational cost grows
with the number of uncertainty scenarios, prolonging the treatment planning
process. We developed a fast and scalable distributed optimization platform
that parallelizes this computation over the scenarios. Methods: We modeled the
robust proton treatment planning problem as a weighted least-squares problem.
To solve it, we employed an optimization technique called the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers with Barzilai-Borwein step size (ADMM-BB). We
reformulated the problem in such a way as to split the main problem into
smaller subproblems, one for each proton therapy uncertainty scenario. The
subproblems can be solved in parallel, allowing the computational load to be
distributed across multiple processors (e.g., CPU threads/cores). We evaluated
ADMM-BB on four head-and-neck proton therapy patients, each with 13 scenarios
accounting for 3 mm setup and 3:5% range uncertainties. We then compared the
performance of ADMM-BB with projected gradient descent (PGD) applied to the
same problem. Results: For each patient, ADMM-BB generated a robust proton
treatment plan that satisfied all clinical criteria with comparable or better
dosimetric quality than the plan generated by PGD. However, ADMM-BB's total
runtime averaged about 6 to 7 times faster. This speedup increased with the
number of scenarios. Conclusion: ADMM-BB is a powerful distributed optimization
method that leverages parallel processing platforms, such as multi-core CPUs,
GPUs, and cloud servers, to accelerate the computationally intensive work of
robust proton treatment planning. This results in 1) a shorter treatment
planning process and 2) the ability to consider more uncertainty scenarios,
which improves plan quality.

the epistemology of AI, and in particular an ethics of belief for AI. Here we
take the ethics of belief, a field that has been defined in various ways, to
refer to a sub-field within epistemology. This subfield is concerned with the
study of possible moral, practical, and other non-alethic dimensions of belief.
And in this paper, we will primarily be concerned with the normative question
within the ethics of belief regarding what agents - both human and artificial -

certain beliefs meet various evaluative standards such as being true, being
justified or warranted, constituting knowledge, and so on. We suggest four
topics in extant work in the ethics of (human) belief that can be applied to an
ethics of AI belief: doxastic wronging by AI; morally owed beliefs; pragmatic
and moral encroachment on AI beliefs; and moral responsibility for AI beliefs.
We also indicate two relatively nascent areas of philosophical research that
haven't yet been generally recognized as ethics of AI belief research, but that
do fall within this field of research in virtue of investigating various moral
and practical dimensions of belief: the epistemic and ethical decolonization of
AI; and epistemic injustice in AI.

from the broken parity symmetry. Both the radiation rate and the chirality

Media Access Control (MAC) protocols to ensure the quality of service (QoS). In
Ad Hoc networks, there is a kind of node called key node, which undertakes more
forwarding traffic than other surrounding nodes. The number of neighbor nodes
around key nodes is often large, and the surrounding channel environment and
interference are often more complex. Thus, the key nodes can hardly get enough
channel access opportunities, resulting in poor end-to-end performance.
Therefore, we propose an adaptive channel reservation MAC protocol based on
forwarding traffic of key nodes, which is aimed at alleviating the congestion
for key nodes. Nodes initiate reservations for future transmission time
according to the buffer status before sending packets and then calculate the
Weight of Reservation Ability (WRA). The node adaptively adjusts its
reservation opportunity by comparing the WRA with neighbor nodes, thus
improving the channel access efficiency and ensuring the transmission

methods. Intractable epilepsy is a severe neurological illness that ripples
across the globe and impacts millions of individuals. It is extremely difficult
to control intractable epilepsy, which is defined as the lack of response to
two or more standard antiepileptic medication treatments. In recent years, the
use of programmable electrical stimulation of the brain has shown promise as a
digital treatment strategy for lowering seizure frequency in individuals with
intractable epilepsy. In this research, the use of Amenable Neurostimulation

investigated. When applied to the brain, ANS uses a closed-loop system to
selectively stimulate neurons in the affected areas, therefore lowering the
frequency of seizures. In addition, the report describes the design and
execution of a pilot research employing ANS to treat intractable epilepsy,
including patient selection criteria, device settings, and outcome measures.
The findings of this pilot research point to the possibility that ANS might be
a realistic and successful therapy option for people afflicted with intractable

Wheeler","Internal symmetry in Poincare gauge gravity","19 pages; 25 pp including references and 2 appendices",,,,"hep-th gr-qc math-ph math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  We find a large internal symmetry within 4-dimensional Poincare gauge theory.
In the Riemann-Cartan geometry of Poincare gauge theory the field equation and
geodesics are invariant under projective transformation, just as in affine
geometry. However, in the Riemann-Cartan case the torsion and nonmetricity
tensors change. By generalizing the Riemann-Cartan geometry to allow both
torsion and nonmetricity while maintaining local Lorentz symmetry the
difference of the antisymmetric part of the nonmetricity Q and the torsion T is
a projectively invariant linear combination $S = T - Q$ with the same symmetry
as torsion. The structure equations may be written entirely in terms of S and
the corresponding Riemann-Cartan curvature. The new description of the geometry
has manifest projective and Lorentz symmetries, and vanishing nonmetricity.
Torsion, S and Q lie in the vector space of vector-valued 2-forms. Within the
extended geometry we define rotations with axis in the direction of S. These
rotate both torsion and nonmetricity while leaving S invariant. In n dimensions
and (p, q) signature this gives a large internal symmetry. The four dimensional
case acquires SO(11,9) or Spin(11,9) internal symmetry, sufficient for the
Standard Model. The most general action up to linearity in second derivatives
of the solder form now includes combinations quadratic in torsion and
nonmetricity, torsion-nonmetricity couplings, and the Einstein-Hilbert action.
Imposing projective invariance reduces this to dependence on S and curvature
alone. The new internal symmetry decouples from gravity in agreement with the
Coleman-Mandula theorem.

  Problems with Nonlinear Control-affine Systems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a new indirect solution method for solving
state-constrained optimal control problems by revisiting the well-established
optimal control theory and addressing the long-standing issue of discontinuous
control and costate due to pure state inequality constraints. It is well-known
that imposing pure state path constraints in optimal control problems
introduces discontinuities in the control and costate, rendering the classical
indirect solution methods ineffective to numerically solve state-constrained
problems. This study re-examines the necessary conditions of optimality for a
class of state-constrained optimal control problems, and shows the uniqueness
of the optimal control input that minimizes the Hamiltonian on constrained
arcs. This analysis leads to a unifying form of optimality necessary conditions
and thereby address the issue of discontinuities in control and costate by
modeling them via smooth functions, transforming the originally discontinuous
problems to smooth two-point boundary value problems (TPBVPs), which can be
readily solved by existing nonlinear root-finding algorithms. The proposed
solution method is shown to have favorable properties, including its anytime
algorithm-like property, which is often a desirable property for
safety-critical applications, and numerically demonstrated by an optimal
orbital transfer problem.

semiclassical tunneling pathways (called instantons). However, the
computational effort can be demanding, especially for instanton optimizations

applied to accelerate reaction-pathway optimization, showing great potential
for a wide range of applications. However, previous methods suffer from
practical issues such as unfavorable scaling with respect to the size of the

an improved framework based on Gaussian process regression for general
transformed coordinates, which can alleviate the size problem. The descriptor
combines internal and Cartesian coordinates, which improves the performance for

In this paper, a novel manifold learning-based CSI feedback framework (MLCF) is
proposed to reduce the feedback and improve the spectral efficiency of FDD
massive MIMO. Manifold learning (ML) is an effective method for dimensionality
reduction. However, most ML algorithms focus only on data compression, and lack
the corresponding recovery methods. Moreover, the computational complexity is
high when dealing with incremental data. To solve these problems, we propose a
landmark selection algorithm to characterize the topological skeleton of the
manifold where the CSI sample resides. Based on the learned skeleton, the local
patch of the incremental CSI on the manifold can be easily determined by its
nearest landmarks. This motivates us to propose a low-complexity compression
and reconstruction scheme by keeping the local geometric relationships with
landmarks unchanged. We theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed
algorithm. Meanwhile, the upper bound on the error of approximating the CSI
samples using landmarks is derived. Simulation results under an industrial
channel model of 3GPP demonstrate that the proposed MLCF method outperforms

the definition applies, and by giving them the option to personally disagree
with the definition on a case-by-case basis. Labeling tweets that call out
antisemitism, report antisemitism, or are otherwise related to antisemitism
(such as the Holocaust) but are not actually antisemitic can help reduce false

neutron-scattering measurements of the vibrational density of states (VDOS) of
water and liquid Fomblin in a wide range of temperatures. In the liquid phase,
we observe a universal low-energy linear scaling of the experimental VDOS as a
function of the frequency, which persists at all temperatures. Importantly, in
both systems, we observe that the slope of this linear behavior grows with
temperature. We confirm this experimental behavior using molecular dynamics
simulations, and we explain it using instantaneous normal mode (INM) theory,
whose predictions are in good agreement with the experimental and simulation
data. Finally, we experimentally observe a sharp crossover at the melting point
of water, below which the standard Debye's law is recovered. On the contrary,
in Fomblin, we observe a gradual and continuous crossover indicating its glassy
dynamics and proving that the low-frequency power-law scaling of the VDOS is a
good probe for the nature of the solid-to-liquid transition. Our results
experimentally confirm the validity of INM theory and the success of a normal

strengths of each modality while mitigating their limitations. The exceptional
and leading performance of fusion models has been demonstrated by advanced deep
neural network (DNN)-based fusion techniques. Fusion models are also perceived
as more robust to attacks compared to single-modal ones due to the redundant
information in multiple modalities. In this work, we challenge this perspective
with single-modal attacks that targets the camera modality, which is considered
less significant in fusion but more affordable for attackers. We argue that the
weakest link of fusion models depends on their most vulnerable modality, and
propose an attack framework that targets advanced camera-LiDAR fusion models
with adversarial patches. Our approach employs a two-stage optimization-based
strategy that first comprehensively assesses vulnerable image areas under

Previous work demonstrates that $\mathcal{N}=3$ accurately captures

optical phenomena, originating in the ultrafast dynamics of electrons in atomic
gasses and semiconductors. It has attracted much attention because of its
non-perturbative nature and potential for future attosecond laser pulse
sources. On the theory side, a semi-classical picture based on tunneling
ionization of electrons is successfully used in explaining key characteristics
of the HHG. This model assumes that electric fields non-perturbatively excite
electrons beyond the ionization potential or band gap. Thus, intuitively, a
larger gap should lead to an exponentially smaller HHG emission. Despite this
intuition, the HHG in the Mott insulator Ca2RuO4 has shown an unconventional
exponential increase with respect to the gap width. This experiment implies
effects beyond the semi-classical theory. However, most theoretical works have
focused on the dependence of the HHG on external control parameters, and the
gap dependence of the HHG is poorly understood even in non interacting systems.
Thus, it is essential to clarify the gap dependence of the HHG in a fully
quantum mechanical approach. Here, we analyze numerically exactly the gap
dependence of the HHG in two-level systems. We find an increase in the strength
of the HHG when the Rabi frequency is large compared to the gap width.
Furthermore, the relaxation and scattering of electrons increase the visibility
of this gap dependence. Finally, we find that the enhancement rate follows a
universal scaling law regardless of the driving frequency. The existence of
this gap dependence in two-level systems suggests that this unconventional gap
dependence is a universal behavior that can be found not only in Mott
insulators but also in atomic gasses and semiconductors.

improve the accuracy of saliency prediction using existing methods.
Specifically, our proposed method takes an image to be detected and inputs it
into several existing models to obtain their respective prediction maps. These
prediction maps are then fed into our positive feedback method to generate the
final prediction result, without the need for careful decoder design or model
training. Moreover, our method is adaptive and can be implemented based on
existing models without any restrictions. Experimental results on five publicly

the latest 12 methods in five evaluation metrics for saliency map prediction.

execution pattern in the cloud-native era. By connecting serverless functions
into workflows, tenants can achieve complex functionality. Prior researches
adopt the control-flow paradigm to orchestrate a serverless workflow. However,
the control-flow paradigm inherently results in long response latency, due to
the heavy data persistence overhead, sequential resource usage, and late
function triggering. Our investigation shows that the data-flow paradigm has
the potential to resolve the above problems, with careful design and
optimization. We propose DataFlower, a scheme that achieves the data-flow
paradigm for serverless workflows. In DataFlower, a container is abstracted to
be a function logic unit and a data logic unit. The function logic unit runs
the functions, and the data logic unit handles the data transmission
asynchronously. Moreover, a host-container collaborative communication
mechanism is used to support efficient data transfer. Our experimental results
show that compared to state-of-the-art serverless designs, DataFlower reduces
the 99\%-ile latency of the benchmarks by up to 35.4\%, and improves the peak
throughput by up to 3.8X.

mainstream works mostly follow a retrieving-and-editing pipeline that heavily

pictorial visualizations conditioned on both semantic context conveyed in

generic for both foreground and background pictorial generation, satisfying the
design practices identified from an empirical research into existing pictorial
visualizations. We further develop an interactive visual interface that
integrates a text analyzer, editing module, and evaluation module to enable

noise and artifacts. To avoid contamination of downstream analyses, fMRI-based
studies must identify and remove these noise sources prior to statistical
analysis. One common approach is the ""scrubbing"" of fMRI volumes that are
thought to contain high levels of noise. However, existing scrubbing techniques
are based on ad hoc measures of signal change. We consider scrubbing via
outlier detection, where volumes containing artifacts are considered
multidimensional outliers. Robust multivariate outlier detection methods are
proposed using robust distances (RDs), which are related to the Mahalanobis
distance. These RDs have a known distribution when the data are i.i.d. normal,
and that distribution can be used to determine a threshold for outliers where
fMRI data violate these assumptions. Here, we develop a robust multivariate
outlier detection method that is applicable to non-normal data. The objective
is to obtain threshold values to flag outlying volumes based on their RDs. We
propose two threshold candidates that embark on the same two steps, but the
choice of which depends on a researcher's purpose. Our main steps are dimension
reduction and selection, robust univariate outlier imputation to get rid of the
effect of outliers on the distribution, and estimating an outlier threshold
based on the upper quantile of the RD distribution without outliers. The first
threshold candidate is an upper quantile of the empirical distribution of RDs
obtained from the imputed data. The second threshold candidate calculates the
upper quantile of the RD distribution that a nonparametric bootstrap uses to
account for uncertainty in the empirical quantile. We compare our proposed fMRI
scrubbing method to motion scrubbing, data-driven scrubbing, and restrictive

graph neural networks (GNNs) are usually highly inclined to majority classes
and suffer from severe performance degradation on classifying minority class

recently which construct synthetic nodes and edges w.r.t. minority classes to
balance the label and topology distribution. However, they are all based on the
homophilic assumption that nodes of the same label tend to connect despite the
wide existence of heterophilic edges in real-world graphs. Thus, they uniformly
aggregate features from both homophilic and heterophilic neighbors and rely on
feature similarity to generate synthetic edges, which cannot be applied to
imbalanced graphs in high heterophily. To address this problem, we propose a
novel GraphSANN for imbalanced node classification on both homophilic and
heterophilic graphs. Firstly, we propose a unified feature mixer to generate
synthetic nodes with both homophilic and heterophilic interpolation in a
unified way. Next, by randomly sampling edges between synthetic nodes and
existing nodes as candidate edges, we design an adaptive subgraph extractor to
adaptively extract the contextual subgraphs of candidate edges with flexible
ranges. Finally, we develop a multi-filter subgraph encoder that constructs
different filter channels to discriminatively aggregate neighbor's information
along the homophilic and heterophilic edges. Extensive experiments on eight

functional theory calculations. This new 3$d$ orbital state is comprehended as
a consequence of competition between the hybrid interatomic orbitals within the

wave (GW) sources have been explored. The time evolution and the intensity of
the emitted GWs in terms of the strain tensor amplitude have been estimated
with the approximation of slow rotation adopting the equation of state derived
using the Skyrme effective interaction with NRAPR parameter set. The core of
the neutron star has been considered to be $\beta$-equilibrated nuclear matter
composed of neutrons, protons, electrons and muons, which is surrounded by a
solid crust. Calculations have been made for the critical frequencies, the
evolution of frequencies and frequency change rates with time as well as the
fiducial viscous and gravitational timescales, across a broad spectrum of
pulsar masses. Our findings reveal that the r-mode instability region is
associated with rotating young and hot pulsars. Furthermore, it is noteworthy
that pulsars with low $L$ value emit gravitational radiation and fall within
the r-mode instability region if the primary dissipative mechanism is shear
viscosity along the crust-core interface boundary layer. The r-mode
perturbation amplitude increases because of GW emissions, in contrast to other
non-radial perturbations which transport to infinity the star's angular
momentum. Thus the presence of these stellar perturbations implies a
non-negative rate of change in transfer of rotational angular momentum. This
observation suggests that for a glitching pulsar, the GW emission intensity
evolves increasingly with time till the angular frequency diminishes to a value
that is below a crucial threshold, after which the compact star ceases to emit
radiation.

has optimized this neuronal variety, we propose exploiting na\""ive behavior to
map the neuronal identity. Here we investigate the feasibility of identifying
neurons ""ecologically"" using their activation for natural behavioral and
environmental parameters. Such a neuronal ECO-marker might give a finer
granularity than possible with genetic or molecular markers, thereby
facilitating the comparison of the functional characteristics of individual
neurons across animals. In contrast to a potential mapping using artificial
stimuli and trained behavior which have an unlimited parameter space, an
ecological mapping is experimentally feasible since it is bounded by the
ecology. Home-cage environment is an excellent basis for this ECO-mapping
covering an extensive behavioral repertoire and since home-cage behavior is
similar across laboratories. We review the possibility of adding area-specific
environmental enrichment and automatized behavioral tasks to identify neurons
in specific brain areas. In this work, we focus on the visual cortex, motor
cortex, prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus. Fundamental to achieving this
identification is to take advantage of state-of-the-art behavioral tracking,
sensory stimulation protocols, and the plethora of creative behavioral
solutions for rodents. We find that motor areas might be easiest to address,
followed by prefrontal, hippocampal, and visual areas. The possibility of
acquiring a near-complete ecological identification with minimal animal
handling, minimal constraints on the main experiment, and data compatibility
across laboratories might outweigh the necessity of implanting electrodes or
imaging devices.

almost the same orbital parameters apart from the inclination, displaced by 180
deg, was launched last year. Its proponents suggest using the sum of the nodes
of LAGEOS and of LARES 2 to measure the sum of the Lense-Thirring node
precessions independently of the systematic bias caused by the even zonal
harmonics of the geopotential, claiming a final $\simeq 0.2$ percent total
accuracy. In fact, the actual orbital configurations of the two satellites do
not allow one to attain the sought for mutual cancellation of their classical
node precessions due to the Earth's quadrupole mass moment, as their sum is
still $\simeq 5000$ times larger than the added general relativistic rates.
This has important consequences. One is that the current uncertainties in the
eccentricities and the inclinations of both satellites do not presently allow
the stated accuracy goal to be met, needing improvements of 3-4 orders of
magnitude. Furthermore, the imperfect knowledge of the Earth's angular momentum
$S$ impacts the uncancelled sum of the node precessions, from 150 to 4900
percent of the relativistic signal depending on the uncertainty assumed in $S$.
It is finally remarked that the real breakthrough in reliably testing the
gravitomagnetic field of the Earth would consist in modeling it and
simultaneously estimating one or more dedicated parameter(s) along with other
ones characterising the geopotential, as is customarily performed for any other
dynamical feature.

materials is a powerful tool for manipulating edge transport behavior, opening
up exciting opportunities for novel electronic and spintronic applications.
This approach is particularly suited to topological crystalline insulators
(TCI), a class of topologically nontrivial compounds that are endowed with
multiple degrees of topological protection. In this study, we investigate how
bulk-edge interactions can influence the edge transport in planar bismuthene, a
TCI with metallic edge states protected by in-plane mirror symmetry, using
first principles calculations and symmetrized Wannier tight-binding models. By
exploring the impact of various perturbation effects, such as device size,
substrate potentials, and applied transverse electric field, we examine the
evolution of the electronic structure and edge transport in planar bismuthene.
Our findings demonstrate that the TCI states of planar bismuthene can be
engineered to exhibit either a gapped or conducting unconventional helical spin
texture via a combination of substrate and electric field effects. Furthermore,
under strong electric fields, the edge states can be stabilized through a
delicate control of the bulk-edge interactions. These results open up new
directions for discovering novel spin transport patterns in topological
materials and provide critical insights for the fabrication of topological
spintronic devices.

method in which an efficient cluster agent is preferred pedestal on its

learning paradigm that has achieved significant success in complex tasks.
However, partial observability issues and the absence of effectively shared
signals between agents often limit its effectiveness in fostering cooperation.
While communication can address this challenge, it simultaneously reduces the
algorithm's practicality. Drawing inspiration from human team cooperative
learning, we propose a novel paradigm that facilitates a gradual shift from
explicit communication to tacit cooperation. In the initial training stage, we
promote cooperation by sharing relevant information among agents and
concurrently reconstructing this information using each agent's local
trajectory. We then combine the explicitly communicated information with the
reconstructed information to obtain mixed information. Throughout the training
process, we progressively reduce the proportion of explicitly communicated
information, facilitating a seamless transition to fully decentralized
execution without communication. Experimental results in various scenarios
demonstrate that the performance of our method without communication can
approaches or even surpasses that of QMIX and communication-based methods.

zero-shot image segmentation using the pre-trained model via two main modes
including automatic everything and manual prompt. SAM has achieved impressive
results on various natural image segmentation tasks. However, medical image
segmentation (MIS) is more challenging due to the complex modalities, fine
anatomical structures, uncertain and complex object boundaries, and wide-range
object scales. Meanwhile, zero-shot and efficient MIS can well reduce the
annotation time and boost the development of medical image analysis. Hence, SAM
seems to be a potential tool and its performance on large medical datasets
should be further validated. We collected and sorted 52 open-source datasets,
and built a large medical segmentation dataset with 16 modalities, 68 objects,
and 553K slices. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of different SAM testing
strategies on the so-called COSMOS 553K dataset. Extensive experiments validate
that SAM performs better with manual hints like points and boxes for object
perception in medical images, leading to better performance in prompt mode
compared to everything mode. Additionally, SAM shows remarkable performance in
some specific objects and modalities, but is imperfect or even totally fails in
other situations. Finally, we analyze the influence of different factors (e.g.,
the Fourier-based boundary complexity and size of the segmented objects) on
SAM's segmentation performance. Extensive experiments validate that SAM's
zero-shot segmentation capability is not sufficient to ensure its direct
application to the MIS.

These methods require vast amounts of training data which are available in the

result of data and privacy regulations. The federated learning technique is
well-suited to tackle these challenges. However, federated learning comes with
a new set of open problems related to communication overhead, efficient

address the step prior to the initiation of a federated network for model

communication overhead and overall cost of training can be reduced without
sacrificing predictive performance. Client recruitment aims at pre-excluding
potential clients from partaking in the federation based on a set of criteria
indicative of their eventual contributions to the federation. In this work, we
propose a client recruitment approach using only the output distribution and

recruited without sacrificing model performance whilst, at the same time,
significantly improving computation time. By applying the recruitment approach
to the training of federated models for accurate patient Length of Stay

  Ranges for Biopharmaceutical Control Strategies","15 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, research article",,,,"math.OC stat.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  According to ICH Q8 guidelines, the biopharmaceutical manufacturer submits a
design space (DS) definition as part of the regulatory approval application, in
which case process parameter (PP) deviations within this space are not
considered a change and do not trigger a regulatory post approval procedure. A
DS can be described by non-linear PP ranges, i.e., the range of one PP
conditioned on specific values of another. However, independent PP ranges
(linear combinations) are often preferred in biopharmaceutical manufacturing
due to their operation simplicity. While some statistical software supports the
calculation of a DS comprised of linear combinations, such methods are
generally based on discretizing the parameter space - an approach that scales
poorly as the number of PPs increases. Here, we introduce a novel method for
finding linear PP combinations using a numeric optimizer to calculate the
largest design space within the parameter space that results in critical
quality attribute (CQA) boundaries within acceptance criteria, predicted by a
regression model. A precomputed approximation of tolerance intervals is used in
inequality constraints to facilitate fast evaluations of this boundary using a
single matrix multiplication. Correctness of the method was validated against
different ground truths with known design spaces. Compared to stateof-the-art,
grid-based approaches, the optimizer-based procedure is more accurate,
generally yields a larger DS and enables the calculation in higher dimensions.
Furthermore, a proposed weighting scheme can be used to favor certain PPs over
others and therefore enabling a more dynamic approach to DS definition and
exploration. The increased PP ranges of the larger DS provide greater
operational flexibility for biopharmaceutical manufacturers.

predicts the next item of users' preference. Most sequential recommendation
methods use a deep neural network as sequence encoder to generate user and item
representations. Existing works mainly center upon designing a stronger
sequence encoder. However, few attempts have been made with training an
ensemble of networks as sequence encoders, which is more powerful than a single
network because an ensemble of parallel networks can yield diverse prediction
results and hence better accuracy. In this paper, we present Ensemble Modeling
with contrastive Knowledge Distillation for sequential recommendation (EMKD).
Our framework adopts multiple parallel networks as an ensemble of sequence
encoders and recommends items based on the output distributions of all these
networks. To facilitate knowledge transfer between parallel networks, we
propose a novel contrastive knowledge distillation approach, which performs
knowledge transfer from the representation level via Intra-network Contrastive
Learning (ICL) and Cross-network Contrastive Learning (CCL), as well as
Knowledge Distillation (KD) from the logits level via minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the output distributions of the teacher
network and the student network. To leverage contextual information, we train
the primary masked item prediction task alongside the auxiliary attribute
prediction task as a multi-task learning scheme. Extensive experiments on
public benchmark datasets show that EMKD achieves a significant improvement
compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Besides, we demonstrate that our
ensemble method is a generalized approach that can also improve the performance
of other sequential recommenders. Our code is available at this link:

consequently led to unsatisfactory generalization capacity of methods driven by

indices do not require training from human opinions, they are unable to account
for the semantics of videos, rendering them ineffective in comprehending
complex authentic distortions (e.g., white balance, exposure) and assessing the
quality of semantic content within videos. To address these challenges, we
introduce the text-prompted Semantic Affinity Quality Index (SAQI) and its
localized version (SAQI-Local) using Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training

facilitating a comprehensive examination of semantic quality concerns without
the reliance on human quality annotations. By amalgamating SAQI with existing

its improved version, BVQI-Local, which demonstrates unprecedented performance,

Moreover, we devise an efficient fine-tuning scheme for BVQI-Local that jointly
optimizes text prompts and final fusion weights, resulting in state-of-the-art

opinion-driven VQA methods. We conduct comprehensive analyses to investigate
different quality concerns of distinct indices, demonstrating the effectiveness

abstraction of a quantum multiple-access channel (QMAC), we translate CSA
schemes over classical multiple-access channels into efficient quantum CSA
schemes over a QMAC, achieving maximal superdense coding gain. Because of the
$N$-sum box abstraction, the underlying problem of coding to exploit quantum

designing a channel matrix for a MIMO MAC subject to given structural
constraints imposed by the $N$-sum box abstraction, such that the resulting
MIMO MAC is able to implement the functionality of a CSA scheme

systematic decrease of the critical temperature (Tc), ranging from a few
percent in bulk lead to more than 40% in compressed lithium. We propose a set

appealing due to their 1.5 $\mu$m optical transition in the telecom band as
well as their long spin coherence times. However, the long lifetimes of the
excited state -- generally in excess of 1 ms -- along with the inhomogeneous
broadening of the optical transition result in significant challenges. Photon
emission rates are prohibitively small, and different emitters generally create
photons with distinct spectra, thereby preventing multi-photon interference --
a requirement for building large-scale, multi-node quantum networks. Here we
solve this challenge by demonstrating for the first time linear Stark tuning of
the emission frequency of a single Er$^{3+}$ ion. Our ions are embedded in a
lithium niobate crystal and couple evanescently to a silicon nano-photonic
crystal cavity that provides an up to 143 increase of the measured decay rate.
By applying an electric field along the crystal c-axis, we achieve a Stark
tuning greater than the ion's linewidth without changing the single-photon
emission statistics of the ion. These results are a key step towards rare earth
ion-based quantum networks.

the memory reset issue in other hash-based arrays by using a second dimension
to clear 1 out of D rows at regular intervals. A hardware-friendly, low-power,

state-of-the-art filters like the BAF/STCF while consuming less than 10% and
15% of their memory and energy-per-event, respectively, for a correlation time

increase with increasing sensor sizes. The proposed filter compares favourably

pressure-correction algorithm for numerical simulation of incompressible flows
around obstacles in the context of projection methods. The key idea is to adopt
different numerical methods/discretizations in the sub-steps of projection
methods. Here, a classical second-order time-marching projection method which
consists of two sub-steps is chosen for the purpose of demonstration. In the
first sub-step, the momentum equations are discretized on unstructured grids
and solved by conventional numerical methods, here, a meshless method. In the
second sub-step (pressure-correction), the proposed algorithm adopts a double
discretization system and combines the weighted least squares approximation
with the essence of immersed boundary methods. Such a design allows us to
develop a FFT-based solver to speed up the solution of the pressure Poisson
equation for flow cases with obstacles, while keeping the implementation of
boundary conditions for the momentum equations as easy as conventional
numerical methods do with unstructured grids. Numerical experiments of five
test cases have been performed to verify and validate the proposed hybrid
algorithm and evaluate its computational performance. The results show that the
new FFT-based hybrid algorithm is working and robust, and it is significantly
faster than the multigrid-based reference method. The hybrid algorithm opens an
avenue for the development of next-generation high-performance parallel

the Huygens Region of the Orion Nebula (M 42). We calculate the associated
transverse structure functions up to order 8-th and find that the higher-order
transverse structure functions are almost proportional to the second-order
transverse structure function: we find that after proper normalisation, the
higher-order transverse structure functions only differ by very small
deviations from the second-order transverse structure function in a
sub-interval of the inertial range. We demonstrate that this implies that the
turbulence in the Huygens Region is quasi-log-homogeneous, or to a better
degree of approximation, binomially weighted log-homogeneous in the statistical
sense, this implies that there is some type of invariant statistical structure
in the velocity field of the Huygens Region. We also obtain and analyse the
power-spectrum of the turbulent field and find that it displays a large tail
that follows very approximately two power-laws, one of the form $E(k)\propto
k^{-2.7}$ for the initial side of the tail, and one of the form $E(k)\propto
k^{-1}$ for the end of the tail. We find that the power-law with exponent
$\beta\sim -2.7$ corresponds to spatial scales of 0.0301--0.6450 pc. We find
that the exponent of the first power-law $\beta\sim -2.7$ is related to the
exponent $\alpha_2$ of the second-order structure function in the inertial
range. We interpret the second power-law with exponent $\beta \sim -1$ as an
indicator of viscous-dissipative processes occurring at scales of $\delta
r=1$--5 pixels which correspond to spatial scales of 0.00043--0.00215 pc.

a greedy search approach, which cannot explore the whole search space as it

tensor graph superoptimisation problem by exploring an alternative search
approach, reinforcement learning (RL). Our proposed approach, X-RLflow, can
learn to perform neural network dataflow graph rewriting, which substitutes a

graph neural network (GNN) to encode the target computation graph and outputs a

October 13, 2015 to April 30, 2022 (2392 days). The very wide dynamic range of
CALET allowed to collect helium data over a large energy interval, from ~40 GeV
to ~250 TeV, for the first time with a single instrument in Low Earth Orbit.
The measured spectrum shows evidence of a deviation of the flux from a single
power-law by more than 8$\sigma$ with a progressive spectral hardening from a
few hundred GeV to a few tens of TeV. This result is consistent with the data
reported by space instruments including PAMELA, AMS-02, DAMPE and balloon
instruments including CREAM. At higher energy we report the onset of a
softening of the helium spectrum around 30 TeV (total kinetic energy). Though
affected by large uncertainties in the highest energy bins, the observation of
a flux reduction turns out to be consistent with the most recent results of
DAMPE. A Double Broken Power Law (DBPL) is found to fit simultaneously both
spectral features: the hardening (at lower energy) and the softening (at higher
energy). A measurement of the proton to helium flux ratio in the energy range
from 60 GeV/n to about 60 TeV/n is also presented, using the CALET proton flux
recently updated with higher statistics.

in which nodes are owned and operated by a large number of diverse and unknown
entities, with each node free to start or stop running the protocol at any
time. This setting is more challenging than the traditional permissioned
setting, in which the set of nodes that will be running the protocol is fixed

provide a framework for reasoning about the rich design space of blockchain
protocols and their capabilities and limitations in the permissionless setting.
  This paper offers a hierarchy of settings with different ""degrees of
permissionlessness"", specified by the amount of knowledge that a protocol has
about the current participants: These are the fully permissionless, dynamically
available and quasi-permissionless settings.
  The paper also proves several results illustrating the utility of our
analysis framework for reasoning about blockchain protocols in these settings.
For example:
  (1) In the fully permissionless setting, even with synchronous communication
and with severe restrictions on the total size of the Byzantine players, every
deterministic protocol for Byzantine agreement has an infinite execution.
  (2) In the dynamically available and partially synchronous setting, no
protocol can solve the Byzantine agreement problem with high probability, even
if there are no Byzantine players at all.
  (3) In the quasi-permissionless and partially synchronous setting, by
contrast, assuming a bound on the total size of the Byzantine players, there is
a deterministic protocol guaranteed to solve the Byzantine agreement problem in
a finite amount of time.
  (4) In the quasi-permissionless and synchronous setting, every proof-of-stake
protocol that does not use advanced cryptography is vulnerable to long-range
attacks.

$0.463^{+0.082}_{-0.088}~M_{\rm Jup}$. We also find that the host star is metal
rich ($\rm [Fe/H] = 0.27 \pm 0.09$ dex) and has the lowest effective

$\sim30~M_\oplus$, which can be explained by both the core accretion and disk
instability models as the formation origins of this planet. However, TOI-519 is
in line with the emerging trend that M dwarfs with close-in giant planets tend
to have high metallicity, which may indicate that they formed in the core
accretion model. The system is also consistent with the potential trend that
close-in giant planets around M dwarfs tend to be less massive than those
around FGK dwarfs.

the dynamics of electrons driven by intense infrared laser fields and have been
intensively studied owing to their potential use as a probe of microscopic
electronic structures. Especially, the ability to measure the temporal response
of high harmonics may allow us to investigate electron dynamics directly in
quantum materials. However, this most essential aspect of high harmonic
emissions has been challenging to measure. Here, we propose a simple solution
for this problem: a high harmonic interferometer, where high harmonics are
generated in each of the path of a Mach-Zehnder interferometer and an
interferogram of them is captured. The high harmonic interferometer allows us
to achieve a relative time resolution between the target and reference high
harmonics of less than 150 attoseconds, which is fine enough to track sub-cycle
dynamics of electrons in solids. By using high harmonic interferometrer, we
succeeded in capturing the real time dynamics of Floquet states in WSe2, whose
indirect signature had so far been caught only by time-averaged measurement.
Our simple technique will open a door to attosecond electron dynamics in

inequality is reflected in the spatial income structure of cities which evolves
in time through various processes. Gentrification is a well-known illustration
of these dynamics in which the population of a low income area changes as
wealthier residents arrive and old-settled residents are expelled. Less
understood but very important is the reverse process of gentrification through
which areas of cities get impoverished. Gentrification has been widely studied
among social sciences, especially in case studies, but there have been fewer
quantitative analyses of this phenomenon, and more generally about the spatial
dynamics of income in cities. Here, we first propose a quantitative analysis of
these income dynamics in cities based on household incomes in 45 American and 9
French Functional Urban Areas (FUA). We found that an important ingredient that
determines the evolution of the income level of an area is the income level of
its immediate neighboring areas. This empirical finding leads to the idea that
these dynamics can be modeled by the voter model of statistical physics. We
show that such a model constitutes an interesting tool for both describing and
predicting evolution scenarios of urban areas with a very limited number of
parameters (two for the US and one for France). We illustrate our results by
computing the probability that areas will change their income status in the
case of Boston and Paris at the horizon of 2030.

approach and the interpretative patterns of the key communicator's tweets of
all years are analyzed using the sociology of knowledge approach to discourse.
This combination of quantitative and qualitative methods reveals that the
discourse is separated into three phases: reporting, reprocessing, and
commemoration. These phases can be identified by the temporal evolution,
network-structural properties, and the contentual analysis of the discourse.
After the negotiation of the interpretative framework in the reprocessing
phase, subsequent years are characterized by its commemorative repetition as
well as resulting demands by different international actor groups despite

single optimal design for the energy grid while considering several scenarios

Giant-atom effects can be observed as a phase-dependent decay of the double

this paper, we analyze a new class of attacks against fTPMs: Attacking their

experimentally verify this attack by compromising the AMD Secure Processor,
which constitutes the TEE for AMD's fTPMs. In contrast to previous dTPM
sniffing attacks, this vulnerability exposes the complete internal TPM state of
the fTPM. It allows us to extract any cryptographic material stored or sealed

of our knowledge - enabling the first attack against Full Disk Encryption

also leaves the disk completely unprotected, we find that BitLocker's FDE

lower performance and reliability. In such a situation, it could be better for
all contending BSSs to use less links if that contributes to reduce channel
access contention. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has proven its
potential for optimizing resource allocation in wireless networks. However, the
independent operation of each wireless network makes difficult -- if not almost

solve this issue, in this paper, we propose the use of a Federated

Defective Coloring, where the input is a graph $G$ and a target degree $\Delta$
and we are asked either to edit or partition the graph so that the maximum
degree becomes bounded by $\Delta$. Both are known to be parameterized
intractable for treewidth.
  We revisit the parameterization by treewidth, as well as several related
parameters and present a more fine-grained picture of the complexity of both
problems.
  Both admit straightforward DP algorithms with table sizes
$(\Delta+2)^\mathrm{tw}$ and $(\chi_\mathrm{d}(\Delta+1))^{\mathrm{tw}}$
respectively, where tw is the input graph's treewidth and $\chi_\mathrm{d}$ the
number of available colors. We show that both algorithms are optimal under
SETH, even if we replace treewidth by pathwidth. Along the way, we also obtain
an algorithm for Defective Coloring with complexity quasi-linear in the table
size, thus settling the complexity of both problems for these parameters.
  We then consider the more restricted parameter tree-depth, and bridge the gap
left by known lower bounds, by showing that neither problem can be solved in
time $n^{o(\mathrm{td})}$ under ETH. In order to do so, we employ a recursive
low tree-depth construction that may be of independent interest.
  Finally, we show that for both problems, an $\mathrm{vc}^{o(\mathrm{vc})}$
algorithm would violate ETH, thus already known algorithms are optimal. Our
proof relies on a new application of the technique of $d$-detecting families
introduced by Bonamy et al.
  Our results, although mostly negative in nature, paint a clear picture
regarding the complexity of both problems in the landscape of parameterized
complexity, since in all cases we provide essentially matching upper and lower

  arXiv:2101.06439",,,,"hep-lat hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Using general properties of the $Q=0$ topological sector we previously argued
that a vector-like theory, with chiral $U(1)_A$ anomaly, and exact non-Abelian
chiral symmetry, should exhibit divergent susceptibilities in the chiral limit,
the two-flavor Schwinger model being a paradigmatic example of the realization
of this scenario. Two flavor $QCD$ at $T>T_c$ satisfies all the above
conditions, and it is also expected that the $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry remains
effectively broken in its high temperature phase. Therefore we would expect a
non-analyticity in the quark mass dependence of the free energy density, in
contrast with the Dilute Instanton Gas Approximation (DIGA) prediction. We
investigate in this work whether the aforementioned results can also be
reproduced making only use of standard properties of the spectral density of
the Dirac operator, without having to resort to general properties of the $Q=0$
topological sector. We show that the only way to derive a non-trivial
$\theta$-dependence, and an analytical free energy density in $QCD$ with two
degenerate flavors is that the spectral density, $\rho\left(\lambda,m\right)$,
of the absolute value of the non-zero modes of the Dirac-Ginsparg-Wilson
operator develops a $m^2\delta(\lambda)$ function in the thermodynamic limit.
This is the expected result in the DIGA, where interactions between instantons
in the dilute gas are fully neglected. However, at temperatures close to $T_c$
the interaction between instantons should become non-negligible, and the
splitting from zero of the near-zero modes, which has been neglected in the
DIGA, should be taken into account. Therefore we expect that the
$m^2\delta(\lambda)$ contribution to the spectral density is no longer correct
at these temperatures, and that the free energy density becomes a non-analytic
function of the quark mass.

However, for a wide class of non-interferometric phase imaging/retrieval

this gap by exploiting entanglement to enhance imaging of a pure phase object
in a non-interferometric setting, only measuring the phase effect on the
free-propagating field. This method, based on the so-called ""transport of
intensity equation"", is quantitative since it provides the absolute value of
the phase without prior knowledge of the object and operates in wide-field
mode, so it does not need time-consuming raster scanning. Moreover, it does not
require spatial and temporal coherence of the incident light. Besides a general
improvement of the image quality at a fixed number of photons irradiated
through the object, resulting in better discrimination of small details, we
demonstrate a clear reduction of the uncertainty in the quantitative phase
estimation. Although we provide an experimental demonstration of a specific

applications at different wavelengths, e.g., X-ray imaging, where reducing the

  Language Models for Knowledge-intensive Tasks","work in progress",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Making the contents generated by Large Language Model (LLM) such as ChatGPT,
accurate, credible and traceable is crucial, especially in complex
knowledge-intensive tasks that require multi-step reasoning and each of which
needs knowledge to solve. Introducing Information Retrieval (IR) to provide LLM
with external knowledge is good potential to solve this problem. However, where
and how to introduce IR into LLM is a big challenge. Previous work has the
disadvantage that the wrong knowledge retrieved by IR misleads the LLM or
breaks the reasoning chain of LLM. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
called Search-in-the-Chain (SearChain) for the interaction between LLM and IR
to solve the challenges. First, LLM generates the global reasoning chain called
Chain-of-Query (CoQ) where each node consists of an IR-oriented query and the
answer to the query. Second, IR verifies the answer of each node of CoQ, it
corrects the answer that is not consistent with the retrieved information when
IR gives high confidence, which improves the credibility. Third, LLM can mark
its missing knowledge in CoQ and IR can provide this knowledge to LLM. These
three operations improve the accuracy of LLM for complex knowledge-intensive
tasks in terms of reasoning ability and knowledge. Finally, SearChain generates
the reasoning process and marks references to supporting documents for each
reasoning step, which improves traceability. SearChain transforms the topology
of reasoning from chain to tree, which can modify the reasoning direction.
Experiment shows that SearChain outperforms baselines on complex
knowledge-intensive tasks including multi-hop question-answering, slot filling,
fact checking, and long-form question-answering.

pipelines with automated machine learning (AutoML) solutions, which
automatically generate the underlying pipelines. We combine AutoML methods with

the manual ML pipeline into a machine learning and non-machine learning part.
To take all complex industrial requirements into account and to demonstrate the

in a case study for the industrial use case of price forecasting, that domain

innovative small and medium-sized enterprises which are interested in

While several works have considered non-uniform, \eg, hexagonal or foveated,

present the first truly end-to-end trained imaging pipeline that optimizes the

parameterization functions: rectangular and curvilinear grid shapes that retain
a regular topology. We provide a drop-in module that approximates sensor
simulation given existing high-resolution images to directly connect our method
with existing deep learning models. We show that network predictions benefit
from learnable pixel layouts for two different downstream tasks, classification

infrequent bursts of disk-aided accretion. Such accretion events are rare and
difficult to observe directly but are known to drive enhanced maser emission.
In this Letter we report high-resolution, multi-epoch methanol maser
observations toward G358.93-0.03 which reveal an interesting phenomenon; the
sub-luminal propagation of a thermal radiation ""heat-wave"" emanating from an
accreting high-mass proto-star. The extreme transformation of the maser
emission implies a sudden intensification of thermal infrared radiation from
within the inner (40 mas, 270 au) region. Subsequently, methanol masers trace
the radial passage of thermal radiation through the environment at $\geq$ 4-8\%
the speed of light. Such a high translocation rate contrasts with the $\leq$ 10
km s$^{-1}$ physical gas motions of methanol masers typically observed using
very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). The observed scenario can readily be
attributed to an accretion event in the high-mass proto-star G358.93-0.03-MM1.
While being the third case in its class, G358.93-0.03-MM1 exhibits unique
attributes hinting at a possible `zoo' of accretion burst types. These results
promote the advantages of maser observations in understanding high-mass star
formation, both through single-dish maser monitoring campaigns and via their
international cooperation as VLBI arrays.

subsequently inhomogeneous accretion disks. Limitations of observational
capabilities, paired with a lack of observed accretion burst events has
withheld affirmative confirmation of the association between disk accretion,
instability and the accretion burst phenomenon in high-mass protostars.
Following its 2019 accretion burst, a heat-wave driven by a burst of radiation
propagated outward from the high-mass protostar G358.93-0.03-MM1. Six VLBI
(very long baseline interferometry) observations of the raditively pumped 6.7
GHz methanol maser were conducted during this period, tracing ever increasing
disk radii as the heat-wave propagated outward. Concatenating the VLBI maps
provided a sparsely sampled, milliarcsecond view of the spatio-kinematics of
the accretion disk covering a physical range of $\sim$ 50 - 900 AU. We term
this observational approach `heat-wave mapping'. We report the discovery of a

length scales for large values of the $\textit{winding length}$ -- the
quasi-period of the Aubry-Andr\'e potential. This intermediate localization is
present both in the metallic and insulating phases of the system. In the
insulating phase, the super-exponential localization is periodically
interrupted by weaker decaying tails to form the conventional asymptotic
exponential decay predicted for the Aubry-Andr\'e model. In the metallic phase,
the super-exponential localization happens for states with energies away from
the center of the spectrum and is followed by a super-exponential growth into
the next peak of the extended eigenstate. By adjusting the parameters it is
possible to arbitrarily extend the validity of the super-exponential

demonstrated in quasiperiodic discrete-time unitary maps.

a gyrochronogical age for ASCC 123 similar to that of the Pleiades, confirming

direct substitution of various transformer components, including the input

choice of classification head has the most significant impact on the model
performance. Surprisingly, Global Average Pooling, which is commonly used in
text classification, performs very poorly in the context of NIDS. In addition,
we show that model size can be reduced by over 50\%, and inference and training

scientific theories under the ERGM framework, statistical inferential

inconsistent behavior when the null hypothesis is true, its inability to
quantify evidence in favor of a null hypothesis, and its inability to test
multiple hypotheses with competing equality and/or order constraints on the

transformation converting to administrative normal form (ANF). Taking as source
language Moggi's computational lambda-calculus (lbc), we define an alternative
to the CPS-translation with target in the sequent calculus LJQ, named
value-filling style (VFS) translation, and making use of the ability of the
sequent calculus to represent contexts formally. The VFS-translation requires
no type translation: indeed, double negations are introduced only when encoding
the VFS target language in the CPS target language. This optional encoding,
when composed with the VFS-translation reconstructs the original
CPS-translation. Going back to direct style, the ""essence"" of the
VFS-translation is that it reveals a new sublanguage of ANF, the value-enclosed
style (VES), next to another one, the continuation-enclosing style (CES): such
an alternative is due to a dilemma in the syntax of lbc, concerning how to
expand the application constructor. In the typed scenario, VES and CES
correspond to an alternative between two proof systems for call-by-value, LJQ
and natural deduction with generalized applications, confirming proof theory as
a foundation for intermediate representations.

critical points where information propagates to the prediction: one from the
relation positions followed by another from the subject positions. Next, by
analyzing the information at these points, we unveil a three-step internal
mechanism for attribute extraction. First, the representation at the
last-subject position goes through an enrichment process, driven by the early
MLP sublayers, to encode many subject-related attributes. Second, information
from the relation propagates to the prediction. Third, the prediction
representation ""queries"" the enriched subject to extract the attribute. Perhaps
surprisingly, this extraction is typically done via attention heads, which
often encode subject-attribute mappings in their parameters. Overall, our
findings introduce a comprehensive view of how factual associations are stored

digitized paintings, derived from the WikiArt repository, using transfer
learning to extract the appropriate features and classical machine learning
methods to evaluate the result. Through the testing of various models and their
fine tuning we came to the conclusion that RegNet performs better in exporting
features, while SVM makes the best classification of images based on the
painter with a performance of up to 85%. Also, we introduced a new large
dataset for painting recognition task including 62 artists achieving good
results.

  shift in regression",,,,,"stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Feature selection is one of the most relevant processes in any methodology
for creating a statistical learning model. Generally, existing algorithms
establish some criterion to select the most influential variables, discarding
those that do not contribute any relevant information to the model. This
methodology makes sense in a classical static situation where the joint
distribution of the data does not vary over time. However, when dealing with
real data, it is common to encounter the problem of the dataset shift and,
specifically, changes in the relationships between variables (concept shift).
In this case, the influence of a variable cannot be the only indicator of its
quality as a regressor of the model, since the relationship learned in the
traning phase may not correspond to the current situation. Thus, we propose a
new feature selection methodology for regression problems that takes this fact
into account, using Shapley values to study the effect that each variable has
on the predictions. Five examples are analysed: four correspond to typical
situations where the method matches the state of the art and one example
related to electricity price forecasting where a concept shift phenomenon has
occurred in the Iberian market. In this case the proposed algorithm improves
the results significantly.

induced by the choices of priors of cosmological parameters, we also combine
the FRB data with the cosmic microwave background data, the baryon acoustic
oscillation data, and type Ia supernova data to constrain the cosmological
parameters and $m_{\gamma}$ simultaneously. We derive a new upper limit of
$m_{\gamma}\le3.8\times 10^{-51}\;\rm{kg}$, or equivalently $m_{\gamma}\le2.1

constraints on both $m_{\gamma}$ and $f_{\rm IGM}$ will be further improved. A

quasi-Monte Carlo methods, where the underlying point set is derived from
deterministic constructions that aim to fill the space more evenly than random
points. Such quasi-Monte Carlo point sets are ordinarily designed for the
uniform measure, and the theory only works for product measures when a
coordinate-wise transformation is applied. Going beyond this setting, we first
consider the case where the target density is a mixture distribution where each
term in the mixture comes from a product distribution. Next we consider target
densities which can be approximated with such mixture distributions. We require
the approximation to be a sum of coordinate-wise products and the approximation
to be positive everywhere (so that they can be re-scaled to probability density
functions). We use tensor product hat function approximations for this purpose
here, since a hat function approximation of a positive function is itself
positive.
  We also study more complex algorithms, where we first approximate the target
density with a general Gaussian mixture distribution and approximate the
mixtures with an adaptive hat function approximation on rotated intervals. The
Gaussian mixture approximation allows us to locate the essential parts of the
target density, whereas the adaptive hat function approximation allows us to
approximate the finer structure of the target density. We prove convergence
rates for each of the integration techniques based on quasi-Monte Carlo
sampling for integrands with bounded partial mixed derivatives. The employed
algorithms are based on digital $(t,s)$-sequences over the finite field
$\mathbb{F}_2$ and an inversion method. Numerical examples illustrate the

two popular techniques: consistency-based regularization and pseudo-labeling.

sensitivity of long axial field-of-view (LAFOV) PET/CT scanners possibly allows
to overcome the small branching ratio for positron production from 90Y decays
and to improve for the post-treatment dosimetry of 90Y of selective internal
radiation therapy.
  Methods: For the challenging case of an image quality body phantom, we
compare a full Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculation with the results from the two
commercial software packages Simplicit90Y and Hermes. The voxel dosimetry
module of Hermes relies on the 90Y images taken with a LAFOV PET/CT, while the
MC and Simplicit90Y dose calculations are image independent.
  Results: The resulting doses from the MC calculation and Simplicit90Y agree
well within the error margins. The image-based dose calculation with Hermes,
however, consistently underestimates the dose. This is due to the mismatch of
the activity distribution in the PET images and the size of the volume of
interest. Furthermore, there are likely limitations of Hermes' dose calculation
algorithm for 90Y. We found that only for the smallest phantom sphere there is
a statistically significant dependence of the Hermes dose on the image
reconstruction parameters and scan time.
  Conclusion: Our study shows that Simplicit90Y's local deposition model can
provide a reliable dose estimate. On the other hand, the image based dose
calculation requires further benchmarks and verification in order to take full
advantage of LAFOV PET/CT systems.

Transformers, which apply layer normalization after each residual block's

Pre-LN causes representation collapse issue that limits model capacity. In this

Theoretically, we prove that ResiDual has a lower bound on the gradient to

ResiDual also has diverse model representations to avoid the collapse issue due
to the residual connection from Post-LN. Empirically, ResiDual outperforms both

students often expect to verify predetermined results, as takes place in
traditional activities. This understanding of what is taking place, or
epistemic framing, may impact their behaviors in the lab, either productively
or unproductively. In this paper, we present an analysis of student epistemic
framing in a nontraditional lab to understand how instructional context,
specifically instructor behaviors, may shape student framing. We present video
data from a lab section taught by an experienced teaching assistant (TA), with
19 students working in seven groups. We argue that student framing in this lab
is evidenced by whether or not students articulate experimental predictions and
by the extent to which they take up opportunities to construct knowledge
(epistemic agency). We show that the TA's attempts to shift student frames
generally succeed with respect to experimental predictions but are less
successful with respect to epistemic agency. In part, we suggest, the success
of the TA's attempts reflects whether and how they are responsive to students'
current framing. This work offers evidence that instructors can shift students'
frames in nontraditional labs, while also illuminating the complexities of both
student framing and the role of the instructor in shifting that framing in this
context.

the Witten effect, on the lattice. In this paper, we address this question in
the case of 2D compact scalars as it would be one of the simplest examples

magnetic operator, we propose the ``excision method,'' which consists of
excising lattice links (or bonds) in an appropriate region containing the
monopole and defining the dual lattice in a particular way. The size of the
excised region is $O(1)$ in lattice units so that the monopole becomes
point-like in the continuum limit. We give the lattice derivation of the

human-robot interaction task, the proposed control design does not assume
knowledge of the anthropometric parameters of the wearer's arm and the payload.
Instead, the uncertainties in human arm parameters, such as mass, length, and
payload, are estimated online using an indirect adaptive control law that
compensates for the gravity moment about the elbow joint. Additionally, the AGC
controller is agnostic to the desired joint trajectory followed by the human
arm. For the purpose of controller design, the human arm is modeled using a
1-DOF manipulator model. Further, a cable-driven actuator model is proposed
that maps the assistive elbow torque to the actuator torque. The performance of
the proposed method is verified through a co-simulation, wherein the control
input realized in MATLAB is applied to the human bio-mechanical model in
OpenSim under varying payload conditions. Significant reductions in human
effort in terms of human muscle torque and metabolic cost are observed with the
proposed control strategy. Further, simulation results show that the
performance of the AGC controller converges to that of the gravity compensation
(GC) controller, demonstrating the efficacy of AGC-based online parameter
learning.

providers are required to further refine the previously trained model so as to
gratify the specific need of local users. This problem is reduced to the
standard model tuning paradigm if the target data is permissibly fed to the
model. However, it is rather difficult in a wide range of practical cases where
target data is not shared with model providers but commonly some evaluations
about the model are accessible. In this paper, we formally set up a challenge
named \emph{Earning eXtra PerformancE from restriCTive feEDdbacks} (EXPECTED)
to describe this form of model tuning problems. Concretely, EXPECTED admits a
model provider to access the operational performance of the candidate model
multiple times via feedback from a local user (or a group of users). The goal
of the model provider is to eventually deliver a satisfactory model to the
local user(s) by utilizing the feedbacks. Unlike existing model tuning methods
where the target data is always ready for calculating model gradients, the
model providers in EXPECTED only see some feedbacks which could be as simple as
scalars, such as inference accuracy or usage rate. To enable tuning in this
restrictive circumstance, we propose to characterize the geometry of the model
performance with regard to model parameters through exploring the parameters'
distribution. In particular, for the deep models whose parameters distribute
across multiple layers, a more query-efficient algorithm is further
tailor-designed that conducts layerwise tuning with more attention to those
layers which pay off better. Our theoretical analyses justify the proposed
algorithms from the aspects of both efficacy and efficiency. Extensive
experiments on different applications demonstrate that our work forges a sound

process by first finding matches and then estimating the pose. As they ignore
the geometric relationships between the two tasks, they focus on either
improving the quality of matches or filtering potential outliers, leading to
limited efficiency or accuracy. In contrast, we propose an iterative matching
and pose estimation framework (IMP) leveraging the geometric connections
between the two tasks: a few good matches are enough for a roughly accurate
pose estimation; a roughly accurate pose can be used to guide the matching by
providing geometric constraints. To this end, we implement a geometry-aware
recurrent attention-based module which jointly outputs sparse matches and
camera poses. Specifically, for each iteration, we first implicitly embed
geometric information into the module via a pose-consistency loss, allowing it
to predict geometry-aware matches progressively. Second, we introduce an
\textbf{e}fficient IMP, called EIMP, to dynamically discard keypoints without
potential matches, avoiding redundant updating and significantly reducing the
quadratic time complexity of attention computation in transformers. Experiments
on YFCC100m, Scannet, and Aachen Day-Night datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms previous approaches in terms of accuracy and
efficiency.

simulate the interaction of a $2\,M_\odot$ red giant branch primary and a

tabulated equation of state (EOS) that accounts for ionization and
recombination, with a run employing an ideal gas EOS. During the first half of
the simulations, $\sim15$ per cent more mass is unbound in the tabulated EOS
run due to the release of recombination energy, but by simulation end the
difference has become negligible. We explain this as being a consequence of (i)
the tabulated EOS run experiences a shallower inspiral and hence smaller
orbital energy release at late times because recombination energy release
expands the envelope and reduces drag, and (ii) collision and mixing between
expanding envelope gas, ejecta and circumstellar ambient gas assists in
unbinding the envelope, but does so less efficiently in the tabulated EOS run
where some of the energy transferred to bound envelope gas is used for
ionization. The rate of mass unbinding is approximately constant in the last
half of the simulations and the orbital separation steadily decreases at late

from 2D projections and compare against raw images to generate a pixel-wise
error to jointly update the curve, camera and renderer parameters using
gradient descent. The method is robust to interference such as bubbles and dirt
trapped in the fluid, stays consistent through complex sequences of postures,
recovers reliable estimates from blurry images and provides a significant

reducing the number of features sensitive to appearance changes and avoiding
the need of additional segmentation networks at test time. Moreover, our

been identified in two globular clusters (namely M13 and NGC 6752) showing a
horizontal branch (HB) morphology with an extended blue tail. The cooling rate
of these WDs is reduced by stable thermonuclear hydrogen burning in their
residual envelope, and they are thought to be originated by stars that populate
the blue tail of the HB and then skip the asymptotic giant branch phase.
Consistently, no evidence of such kind of WDs has been found in M3, a similar
cluster with no blue extension of the HB. To further explore this phenomenon,
we took advantage of deep photometric data acquired with the Hubble Space
Telescope in the near-ultraviolet and investigate the bright portion of the WD
cooling sequence in M5, another Galactic globular cluster with HB morphology
similar to M3. The normalized WD luminosity function derived in M5 turns out to
be impressively similar to that observed in M3, in agreement with the fact that
the stellar mass distribution along the HB of these two systems is almost
identical. The comparison with theoretical predictions is consistent with the
fact that the cooling sequence in this cluster is populated by canonical (fast
cooling) WDs. Thus, the results presented in this paper provide further support
to the scenario proposing a direct causal connection between the slow cooling
WD phenomenon and the horizontal branch morphology of the host stellar cluster.

consecutive in the same voice/stream. This kind of local, greedy prediction is
made possible by node embeddings created by a heterogeneous graph neural
network that can capture inter- and intra-trajectory information. Furthermore,
we propose a new regularization loss that encourages the output to respect the
MTT premise of at most one incoming and one outgoing link for every node,
favouring monophonic (voice) trajectories; this loss function might also be
useful in other general MTT scenarios. Our approach does not use

compared to that of the flux-limited model due to the lower coronal plasma

strongly dependent on the laser frequency, and the thresholds that the

multi-label weather recognition model considering these dependencies. The
proposed model called MASK-Convolutional Neural Network-Transformer (MASK-CT)
is based on the Transformer, the convolutional process, and the MASK mechanism.
The model employs multiple convolutional layers to extract features from
weather images and a Transformer encoder to calculate the probability of each
weather condition based on the extracted features. To improve the
generalization ability of MASK-CT, a MASK mechanism is used during the training
phase. The effect of the MASK mechanism is explored and discussed. The Mask
mechanism randomly withholds some information from one-pair training instances
(one image and its corresponding label). There are two types of MASK methods.
Specifically, MASK-I is designed and deployed on the image before feeding it
into the weather feature extractor and MASK-II is applied to the image label.
The Transformer encoder is then utilized on the randomly masked image features
and labels. The experimental results from various real-world weather
recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed MASK-CT model outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the high-speed dynamic real-time weather

globally from the eruption center in the solar atmosphere, just like the
tsunamis in the ocean on Earth. Theoretically, coronal waves can sweep over the
underlying chromosphere and leave an imprint in the form of Moreton wave, due
to the enhanced pressure beneath their coronal wavefront. Despite the frequent
observations of coronal waves, their counterparts in the chromosphere are
rarely detected. Why the chromosphere rarely bears the imprints of solar
tsunamis remained a mystery since their discovery three decades ago. To resolve
this question, all coronal waves and associated Moreton waves in the last
decade have been initially surveyed, though the detection of Moreton waves
could be hampered by utilising the low-quality H$\alpha$ data from Global
Oscillations Network Group. Here, we present 8 cases (including 5 in Appendix)
of the coexistence of coronal and Moreton waves in inclined eruptions where it
is argued that the extreme inclination is key to providing an answer to address
the question. For all these events, the lowest part of the coronal wavefront
near the solar surface appears very bright, and the simultaneous disturbances
in the solar transition region and the chromosphere predominantly occur beneath
the bright segment. Therefore, evidenced by observations, we propose a scenario
for the excitation mechanism of the coronal-Moreton waves in highly inclined
eruptions, in which the lowest part of a coronal wave can effectively disturb
the chromosphere even for a weak (e.g., B-class) solar flare.

Generally, it is believed that EUV waves are driven by the rapid expansion of

exception of EUV wave that was not triggered by the expansion of coronal loops
overlying the erupting core. Methods. Combining the multiwavelength
observations from multiple instruments, we studied the event in detail.
Results. The eruption was restricted in the active region (AR) and disturbed
the nearby sheared arcades (SAs) connecting the source AR to a remote AR.
Interestingly, following the disturbance, an EUV wave formed close to the SAs,
but far away from the eruption source. Conclusions. All the results showed that
the EUV wave had a closer temporal and spatial relationship with the
disappearing part of SAs than the confined eruption. Hence, we suggest that the
EUV wave was likely triggered by the expansion of some strands of SAs, rather
than the expansion of erupting loops. It can be a possible complement for the

transparency in safety-critical AI-based systems, as mandated in various
domains like automated driving. However, to use the concept representations for
safety-relevant purposes, like inspection or error retrieval, these must be of
high quality and, in particular, stable. This paper focuses on two stability
goals when working with concept representations in computer vision CNNs:
stability of concept retrieval and of concept attribution. The guiding use-case
is a post-hoc explainability framework for object detection (OD) CNNs, towards
which existing concept analysis (CA) methods are successfully adapted. To
address concept retrieval stability, we propose a novel metric that considers
both concept separation and consistency, and is agnostic to layer and concept
representation dimensionality. We then investigate impacts of concept
abstraction level, number of concept training samples, CNN size, and concept
representation dimensionality on stability. For concept attribution stability
we explore the effect of gradient instability on gradient-based explainability
methods. The results on various CNNs for classification and object detection
yield the main findings that (1) the stability of concept retrieval can be
enhanced through dimensionality reduction via data aggregation, and (2) in
shallow layers where gradient instability is more pronounced, gradient
smoothing techniques are advised. Finally, our approach provides valuable
insights into selecting the appropriate layer and concept representation
dimensionality, paving the way towards CA in safety-critical XAI applications.

incorporated into the dual-criteria time-stepping framework developed by Zhang

Submitted to MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the beginning of 2023 the Be transient X-ray pulsar RX J0440.9+4431
underwent a fist-ever giant outburst observed from the source peaking in the
beginning of February and reaching peak luminosity of $\sim 4.3\times10^{37}$
erg s$^{-1}$. Here we present the results of a detailed spectral and temporal
study of the source based on NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, Swift, and NICER observations
performed during this period and covering wide range of energies and
luminosities. We find that both the pulse profile shape and spectral hardness
change abruptly around $\sim2.8\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, which we associate
with a transition to super-critical accretion regime and erection of the
accretion column. The observed pulsed fraction decreases gradually with energy
up to 20 keV (with a local minimum around fluorescence iron line), which is
unusual for an X-ray pulsar, and then rises rapidly at higher energies with the
pulsations significantly detected up to $\sim120$ keV. The broadband energy
spectra of RX J0440.9+4431 at different luminosity states can be approximated
with a two-hump model with peaks at energies of about 10-20 and 50-70 keV
previously suggested for other pulsars without additional features. In
particular an absorption feature around 30 keV previously reported and
interpreted as a cyclotron line in the literature appears to be absent when
using this model, so the question regarding the magnetic field strength of the
neutron star remains open. Instead, we attempted to estimate field using
several indirect methods and conclude that all of them point to a relatively
strong field of around $B\sim 10^{13}$ G.

shape variations are widespread in computational mechanics. However, classical
linear model reduction and interpolation methods typically fail to reproduce
even relatively small parameter variations, making the reduced models
inefficient and inaccurate. In this work a novel reduced order modelling
approach is proposed based on the Radon-Cumulative-Distribution transform
(RCDT). We show that this non-linear transformation can significantly improve
the dimensionality of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) reconstructions and
is capable of interpolating accurately some advection-dominated phenomena. The
method is tested on various testcases in multiphase fluid dynamics.

differential equations with dominating advection effects and moving features.
Registration refers to the use of a parameter-dependent mapping to make the set

reduced basis methods. The proposed approach utilizes concepts from optimal
transport theory, as we utilize Monge embeddings to construct these mappings in
a purely data-driven way. The method relies on one interpretable
hyper-parameter. We discuss how our approach relates to existing works that
combine model order reduction and optimal transport theory. Numerical results
are provided to demonstrate the effect of the registration. This includes a

this paper, we apply TADS to the problem of neural network verification, using
them to generate either proofs or concise error characterizations for desirable
neural network properties. In a case study, we consider the robustness of
neural networks to adversarial attacks, i.e., small changes to an input that
drastically change a neural networks perception, and show that TADS can be used
to provide precise diagnostics on how and where robustness errors a occur. We
achieve these results by introducing Precondition Projection, a technique that
yields a TADS describing network behavior precisely on a given subset of its
input space, and combining it with PCA, a traditional, well-understood
dimensionality reduction technique. We show that PCA is easily compatible with
TADS. All analyses can be implemented in a straightforward fashion using the
rich algebraic properties of TADS, demonstrating the utility of the TADS
framework for neural network explainability and verification. While TADS do not
yet scale as efficiently as state-of-the-art neural network verifiers, we show
that, using PCA-based simplifications, they can still scale to mediumsized
problems and yield concise explanations for potential errors that can be used
for other purposes such as debugging a network or generating new training
samples.

  Imaging via Physics-Guided Restoration","34 pages, 13 figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Terahertz (THz) tomographic imaging has recently attracted significant
attention thanks to its non-invasive, non-destructive, non-ionizing,
material-classification, and ultra-fast nature for object exploration and
inspection. However, its strong water absorption nature and low noise tolerance
lead to undesired blurs and distortions of reconstructed THz images. The
diffraction-limited THz signals highly constrain the performances of existing
restoration methods. To address the problem, we propose a novel multi-view
Subspace-Attention-guided Restoration Network (SARNet) that fuses multi-view
and multi-spectral features of THz images for effective image restoration and
3D tomographic reconstruction. To this end, SARNet uses multi-scale branches to
extract intra-view spatio-spectral amplitude and phase features and fuse them
via shared subspace projection and self-attention guidance. We then perform
inter-view fusion to further improve the restoration of individual views by
leveraging the redundancies between neighboring views. Here, we experimentally
construct a THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) system covering a broad
frequency range from 0.1 THz to 4 THz for building up a
temporal/spectral/spatial/ material THz database of hidden 3D objects.
Complementary to a quantitative evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
our SARNet model on 3D THz tomographic reconstruction applications.

  and Auxiliary Covariates","16 papges, 7 Figures",,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Assessing causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding is a
challenging problem. Although auxiliary variables, such as instrumental
variables, are commonly used to identify causal effects, they are often
unavailable in practice due to stringent and untestable conditions. To address
this issue, previous researches have utilized linear structural equation models
to show that the causal effect can be identifiable when noise variables of the
treatment and outcome are both non-Gaussian. In this paper, we investigate the
problem of identifying the causal effect using auxiliary covariates and
non-Gaussianity from the treatment. Our key idea is to characterize the impact
of unmeasured confounders using an observed covariate, assuming they are all
Gaussian. The auxiliary covariate can be an invalid instrument or an invalid
proxy variable. We demonstrate that the causal effect can be identified using
this measured covariate, even when the only source of non-Gaussianity comes
from the treatment. We then extend the identification results to the
multi-treatment setting and provide sufficient conditions for identification.
Based on our identification results, we propose a simple and efficient
procedure for calculating causal effects and show the $\sqrt{n}$-consistency of
the proposed estimator. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our estimator
through simulation studies and an application.

localized radio source emitting a signal. We consider that geographically
distributed sensor nodes obtain energy measurements and compute cooperatively a
statistic to decide if the source is present or absent. We model the radio
source as a stochastic signal and deal with spatially statistically dependent
measurements, whose probability density function (PDF) has unknown positive
parameters when the radio source is active. Under the framework of the
Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) theory, the positive constraint on the
unknown multidimensional parameter makes the computation of the GLRT asymptotic
performance (when the amount of sensor measurements tends to infinity) more
involved. Nevertheless, we analytically characterize the asymptotic
distribution of the statistic. Moreover, as the GLRT is not amenable for
distributed settings because of the spatial statistical dependence of the
measurements, we study a GLRT-like test where the joint PDF of the measurements
is substituted by the product of its marginal PDFs, and therefore, the
statistical dependence is completely discarded for building this test.
Nevertheless, its asymptotic performance is proved to be identical to the
original GLRT, showing that the statistically dependence of the measurements
has no impact on the detection performance in the asymptotic scenario.
Furthermore, the GLRT-like algorithm has a low computational complexity and
demands low communication resources, as compared to the GLRT.

risk, reducing radiation dose in PET scans is an important topic. However,
low-count PET scans often suffer from high image noise, which can negatively
impact image quality and diagnostic performance. Recent advances in deep
learning have shown great potential for recovering underlying signal from noisy
counterparts. However, neural networks trained on a specific noise level cannot
be easily generalized to other noise levels due to different noise amplitude
and variances. To obtain optimal denoised results, we may need to train
multiple networks using data with different noise levels. But this approach may
be infeasible in reality due to limited data availability. Denoising dynamic
PET images presents additional challenge due to tracer decay and continuously
changing noise levels across dynamic frames. To address these issues, we
propose a Unified Noise-aware Network (UNN) that combines multiple sub-networks
with varying denoising power to generate optimal denoised results regardless of
the input noise levels. Evaluated using large-scale data from two medical
centers with different vendors, presented results showed that the UNN can
consistently produce promising denoised results regardless of input noise
levels, and demonstrate superior performance over networks trained on single

have been gradually intensified during the last decades, predominantly due to
the propagation of large fleet natural gas-fired power units (GPUs) and the
technological developments of power-to-gas (P2G) facilities. These interactions
not only bring significant economic benefits to society but also provide
additional operating flexibilities, which are essential to handle fluctuations
of the large-scale renewable power generation (RPG) and power system
contingencies. Moreover, neglecting these interactions in power system
operation may not only result in infeasible operation status in the gas systems
but also increase the decision-making operation costs of both systems. previous
studies suffered from two significant drawbacks, namely (1) they assumed the
existence of only one utility that has full control authority over the power
system and gas system; (2) the economic interactions between power systems and
gas systems have been neglected, which goes against the current industrial
practice. This research revisits the day-ahead resilient and economic
operations of power systems considering the economic and physical interactions
with gas systems, which are characterized by the modeling of bilateral energy
purchase contracts and operational constraints of gas systems. This thesis
provides a novel perspective and solution for the resilient and economically
coordinated robust operation of integrated electric-gas systems (IEGSs) under
uncertainties. The proposed robust scheduling decision frameworks are
practically compatible with the existing industrial operations of the IEGSs.

of determining their efficiency and finding the best TR cell materials among

their efficiency is influenced by several factors such as the bandgap,
temperature difference, and absorption spectrum. To create a realistic model,
we incorporate sub-bandgap and heat losses in our calculations and utilize
density-functional theory to determine the energy gap and optical properties of
each material. Our findings suggest that the effect of absorptivity on the
material, especially when the sub-bandgap and heat losses are considered, can
decrease the efficiency of TR cells. However, careful treatment of the
absorptivity indicates that not all materials have the same trend of decrease
in the TR cell efficiency when taking the loss mechanisms into account. We
observe that GaSb exhibits the highest power density, while InP demonstrates
the lowest one. Moreover, GaAs and InP exhibit relatively high efficiency
without the sub-bandgap and heat losses, whereas InAs display lower efficiency
without considering the losses, yet exhibit higher resistance to sub-bandgap
and heat losses compared to the other materials, thus effectively becoming the
best TR cell material in the III-V group of semiconductors.

metal-metal oxide cycles as proposed by Bergthorson (Prog. Energy Combust.
Sci., 2018). Iron powder is a suitable candidate since it can be oxidized with
air. Nevertheless, the combustion of iron powder in air is challenging
especially with respect to flame stabilization which depends on the particle
size distribution among other factors. Models for the prediction of reaction
front speed in iron-air suspensions can contribute to overcoming this
challenge. To this end, three different models for iron particle oxidation are
integrated into a laminar flame solver for simulating reaction fronts. The
scientific objective of this work is to elucidate the influence of
polydispersity on the reaction front speed, which is still not satisfactorily
understood. In a systematic approach, cases with successively increasing
complexity are considered: From single particle combustion to iron-air
suspensions prescribing binary particle size distributions (PSDs), generic
PSDs, and a PSD measured for a real iron powder sample. The simulations show
that, dependent on the PSD, particles undergo thermochemical conversion in a
sequential manner according to their size and every particle fraction exhibits
an individual combustion environment. The local environment can be leaner or
richer than the overall iron-to-air ratio would suggest and can be very
different from single particle experiments. The contribution of individual
particle fractions to the overall reaction front speed depends on its ranking
within the PSD. The study further demonstrates, that although the three
particle models show good agreement for single particle combustion, they lead
to very different reaction front speeds. This is due to the different ignition
behavior predicted by the particle models, which is shown to strongly influence
the reaction front characteristics.

problem of a reflection from an impenetrable wall, the obtained solution is
then generalized to the case of a particle confined in an infinite well in
arbitrary dimensions. It is known, that boundary value problems in the phase
space formulation of the quantum mechanics are surprisingly tricky. The
complications arise from nonlocality of the expression involved in calculation
of the Wigner function. Several ways of treating such problems were proposed.
They are rather complicated and even exotic, involving, for example,
corrections to the kinetic energy proportional to the derivatives of the Dirac
delta--function. The presented in the manuscript approach is simpler both from
analytical point of view and regarding numerical calculation. The solution is
brought to a form of convolution of the free particle solution with some
function, defined by the shape of the well. This procedure requires calculation
of an integral, which can be done by developed analytical and numerical method.

However, existing datasets for detecting online propaganda have a key
limitation: they were annotated using weak labels that can be noisy and even
incorrect. To address this limitation, our work makes the following
contributions: (1) We present HQP: a novel dataset (N=30,000) for detecting
online propaganda with high-quality labels. To the best of our knowledge, HQP
is the first dataset for detecting online propaganda that was created through
human annotation. (2) We show empirically that state-of-the-art language models
fail in detecting online propaganda when trained with weak labels (AUC: 64.03).
In contrast, state-of-the-art language models can accurately detect online
propaganda when trained with our high-quality labels (AUC: 92.25), which is an
improvement of ~44%. (3) To address the cost of labeling, we extend our work to
few-shot learning. Specifically, we show that prompt-based learning using a
small sample of high-quality labels can still achieve a reasonable performance
(AUC: 80.27). Finally, we discuss implications for the NLP community to balance
the cost and quality of labeling. Crucially, our work highlights the importance
of high-quality labels for sensitive NLP tasks such as propaganda detection.

tools in basic and applied sciences for example to fine-tune genetic circuits

modular structure, the design of functional synthetic sRNAs is not necessarily
trivial. This protocol outlines how to use computational predictions and
synthetic biology approaches to design, construct and validate synthetic sRNA
functionality for their application in bacteria. The computational tool,
SEEDling, matches the optimal seed region with the user-selected sRNA scaffold
for repression of target mRNAs. The synthetic sRNAs are assembled using Golden
Gate cloning and their functionality is subsequently validated. The protocol
uses the acrA mRNA as an exemplary proof-of-concept target in Escherichia coli.
Since AcrA is part of a multidrug efflux pump, acrA repression can be revealed
by assessing oxacillin susceptibility in a phenotypic screen. However, in case
target repression does not result in a screenable phenotype, an alternative
validation of synthetic sRNA functionality based on a fluorescence reporter is
described.

shaking. Tremor of the hand is a key symptom of multiple neurological diseases,
and its frequency and amplitude differs according to both disease type and
disease progression. In routine clinical practice, tremor frequency and
amplitude are assessed by expert rating using a 0 to 4 integer scale. Such
ratings are subjective and have poor inter-rater reliability. There is thus a
clinical need for a practical and accurate method for objectively assessing
hand tremor.
  Objective: to develop a proof of principle method to measure hand tremor
amplitude from smartphone videos.
  Methods: We created a computer vision pipeline that automatically extracts
salient points on the hand and produces a 1-D time series of movement due to
tremor, in pixels. Using the smartphones' depth measurement, we convert this
measure into real distance units. We assessed the accuracy of the method using
60 videos of simulated tremor of different amplitudes from two healthy adults.
Videos were taken at distances of 50, 75 and 100 cm between hand and camera.
The participants had skin tone II and VI on the Fitzpatrick scale. We compared
our method to a gold-standard measurement from a slide rule. Bland-Altman
methods agreement analysis indicated a bias of 0.04 cm and 95% limits of
agreement from -1.27 to 1.20 cm. Furthermore, we qualitatively observed that
the method was robust to differences in skin tone and limited occlusion, such
as a band-aid affixed to the participant's hand.
  Clinical relevance: We have demonstrated how tremor amplitude can be measured
from smartphone videos. In conjunction with tremor frequency, this approach
could be used to help diagnose and monitor neurological diseases

characterizing dynamic processes on disordered media. In a random fractal
embedded in the Euclidean space, the MFPT is known to obey the power law
scaling with the distance between a source and a target site with a universal
exponent. We find that the scaling law for the MFPT is not determined solely by
the distance between a source and a target but also by their locations. The
role of a site in the first passage processes is quantified by the random walk
centrality. It turns out that the site of highest random walk centrality,
dubbed as a hub, intervenes in first passage processes. We show that the MFPT
from a departure site to a target site is determined by a competition between
direct paths and indirect paths detouring via the hub. Consequently, the MFPT
displays a crossover scaling between a short distance regime, where direct
paths are dominant, and a long distance regime, where indirect paths are
dominant. The two regimes are characterized by power laws with different
scaling exponents. The crossover scaling behavior is confirmed by extensive
numerical calculations of the MFPTs on the critical percolation cluster in two
dimensional square lattices.

respect to a reference frame provided by some external observer. Thus, if one
wishes to localize the quantum information within a spatially separated
entangled state, one must enact an entanglement extraction protocol also
defined with respect to that external frame. Entanglement extraction for
Gaussian ground states in such an external frame construction has been shown to
require a minimum energy and is hence an interesting process for gravitational
physics, where examinations of localization vs. energy cost have a long
history. General covariance however, precludes dependence on external frames.
In order to enact an extraction protocol in a generally covariant theory,
dependence on the external reference frame must first be removed and the states
made relational. We examine the implementation of an extraction protocol for
Gaussian states, who's center-of-mass and relational degrees of freedom are
entangled, in a relational toy model where translation invariance stands in for
full diffeomorphism invariance. Constructing fully relational states and the
corresponding extraction/localization can, in principle, be done in two ways.
External frame position information can be removed through $G$-twirling over
translations or one can spontaneously break the translation symmetry via the
gradient of an auxiliary field, or $Z$-model. We determine the energetics of
quantum information localization after the states have been made fully
relational via both the $G$-twirl and $Z$-model. We also show one can smoothly
transition between the two approaches via positive operator valued measurements
(POVM).

surfaces of a canine ventricle as observations directing a local ensemble
transform Kalman Filter (LETKF) data assimilation scheme. We demonstrate that
the inclusion of explicit information about the stimulation protocol can
marginally improve the confidence of the ensemble reconstruction and the
reliability of the assimilation over time. Likewise, we consider the efficacy
of stochastic modeling additions to the assimilation scheme in the context of
experimentally derived observation sets. Approximation error is addressed at
both the observation and modeling stages, through the uncertainty of
observations and the specification of the model used in the assimilation
ensemble. We find that perturbative modifications to the observations have
marginal to deleterious effects on the accuracy and robustness of the state
reconstruction. Further, we find that incorporating additional information from
the observations into the model itself (in the case of stimulus and stochastic
currents) has a marginal improvement on the reconstruction accuracy over a
fully autonomous model, while complicating the model itself and thus
introducing potential for new types of model error. That the inclusion of
explicit modeling information has negligible to negative effects on the
reconstruction implies the need for new avenues for optimization of data
assimilation schemes applied to cardiac electrical excitation.

predictor approach is further categorized, one with Lookahead driver and second
with Stanley driver. Simulations are conducted in a Simulink environment,
considering variable network delays and different vehicle speeds, and include
maneuvers such as tight corners, slalom, low-adhesion roads, and strong

the process of building a realistic model, as well as using large computing
resources and large amounts of source data. In the process of planning the
development of transport systems, the correct compilation of correspondence

phenomenological theory i.e., not a causal theory, ( not because it is a
statistical theory - statistical theories with caused probability distributions
can be regarded as causal) but because pure states, i.e., probability
distributions of measurement values, cannot inhere in elementary particles and
therefore cannot change when their world tubes intersect and hence they cannot
be regarded as interacting causally. By a causal theory is meant a theory that
specifies the changes in time of the states of causally interacting entities in
its domain. The areas in quantum mechanics in which causal interactions are
relevant include, though not explicitly, measurement and therefore the Born
rule, and, explicitly, the unitary Schrodinger time development of states. The
Born rule probabilities are shown to to refer not to conjoint superpositions of
eigenstates but to classical mixtures of mutually exclusive eigenvalues and the
Schrodinger time development of states is shown to refer to the time
development of the states of non-causally interacting elementary particles and
hence cannot be regarded as as a causal time development equation, appearances
to the contrary notwithstanding. The recognition that quantum mechanics is not
a causal theory but a phenomenological theory like thermodynamics does not
affect the way it is employed to calculate an predict and hence preserves its
empirical success but it does allow a typically simple phenomenological theory
explanation of entanglement and other apparently non-local phenomena.

neurotransmitters released diffusely throughout the brain and spinal cord. We
present strong evidence that human motor pathways are equally affected by
neuromodulation through noradrenergic and serotonergic projections arising from
the brainstem. To do so, we have identified and collated human experiments
examining the off-label effects of well-characterised serotonergic and
noradrenergic drugs on lab-based electrophysiology measures of
corticospinal-motoneuronal excitability. Specifically, we focus on the effects
that serotonin and noradrenaline associated drugs have on muscle responses to
magnetic or electrical stimulation of the motor cortex and peripheral nerves,
and other closely related tests of motoneuron excitability, to best segment
drug effects to a supraspinal or spinal locus. We find that serotonin enhancing
drugs tend to reduce the excitability of the human motor cortex, but that
augmented noradrenergic transmission increases motor cortical excitability by
enhancing measures of intracortical facilitation and reducing inhibition. Both
monoamines tend to enhance the excitability of human motoneurons. Overall, this
work details the importance of neuromodulators for the output of human motor
pathways and suggests that commonly prescribed monoaminergic drugs have
off-label motor control uses outside of their typical psychiatric/neurological

list of district K-mers which assist in searching large databases and reducing
the size of de Bruijn graphs. Nonetheless, K-mer counting is a data and
compute-intensive process. Hence, it is crucial to implement a lightweight data
structure that occupies low memory but does fast processing of K-mers. We
proposed a lightweight K-mer counting technique, called KmerCo that implements
a potent counting Bloom Filter variant, called countBF. KmerCo has two phases:
insertion and classification. The insertion phase inserts all K-mers into
countBF and determines distinct K-mers. The classification phase is responsible
for the classification of distinct K-mers into trustworthy and erroneous K-mers
based on a user-provided threshold value. We also proposed a novel benchmark

experiments are conducted using DNA sequences of four organisms. The datasets
are pruned to generate four different size datasets. KmerCo is compared with
Squeakr, BFCounter, and Jellyfish. KmerCo took the lowest memory, highest

allows adversaries/attackers to alter sensor measurements through stealthy

Therefore, performing an attack space analysis of modern home control systems

jointly training an encoder for seismic data and a decoder for the velocity map
from seismic-velocity pairs. In this paper, we report a surprising phenomenon:
when training an encoder and decoder separately in their own domains via
self-supervised learning, a linear relationship is observed across domains in
the latent spaces. Moreover, this phenomenon connects multiple FWI datasets in
an elegant manner: these datasets can share the self-learned encoder and
decoder with different linear mappings.
  Based on these findings, we develop SimFWI, a new paradigm that includes two
steps: (a) learning a seismic encoder and a velocity decoder separately by
masked image modeling over multiple datasets; (b) learning a linear mapping per

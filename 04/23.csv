but robustness alone is not sufficient. The ability to switch between
appropriate states (phenotypes) in response to different conditions is
essential for biological functions. How are robustness and plasticity
simultaneously acquired through evolution? We examine the evolution of
genotypes that realize plastic switching between two phenotypes upon external
inputs, as well as stationary expressions of phenotypes. We introduce a
statistical physics model consisting of spins, with active and regulatory
sites, which are distinct from each other. We represent the phenotype and
genotype as spin configurations and the spin-spin interactions, respectively.
The fitness for selection is given so that it takes a higher value as more of
the active sites take two requested spin configurations depending on the
regulation. We numerically evolve the interaction matrix by changing them with
mutations and selection of those with higher fitness. Our numerical simulations
show that characteristic genotypes evolve slightly above the transition
temperature between replica symmetric and replica symmetry breaking phase.
These genotypes shape two spin configurations separately depending on the
regulation, where the two phenotypes are dominantly represented by the
genotypes' first and second eigenmodes, and smooth switching of two phenotypes
are achieved by following a one-dimensional path connecting the two phenotypes.
Upon changes in regulations, spin configurations are attracted to this path,
which allows for robust and plastic switching between the two phenotypes. The
statistical-physics analysis show that the free energy landscape has a valley
along the switching path. Our finding indicates that the compatibility of the
robustness and plasticity is acquired by the evolution of the
low-dimensionality in the phenotype space.

the slow sampling procedure. DDPMs generally need hundreds or thousands of
sequential function evaluations (steps) of neural networks to generate a

much fewer steps while retaining high sample quality. The inference process of

to the impressively high quality in 3D scene reconstruction and novel view

decrease the reconstruction quality when shooting scenes in hazy conditions. To
address this issue, we propose Dehazing-NeRF, a method that can recover clear
NeRF from hazy image inputs. Our method simulates the physical imaging process

atmospheric scattering model and a clean NeRF model for both image dehazing and
novel view synthesis. Different from previous approaches, Dehazing-NeRF is an
unsupervised method with only hazy images as the input, and also does not rely
on hand-designed dehazing priors. By jointly combining the depth estimated from
the NeRF 3D scene with the atmospheric scattering model, our proposed model
breaks through the ill-posed problem of single-image dehazing while maintaining
geometric consistency. Besides, to alleviate the degradation of image quality
caused by information loss, soft margin consistency regularization, as well as
atmospheric consistency and contrast discriminative loss, are addressed during
the model training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms the simple combination of single-image dehazing and NeRF on both

statistics. Rigorous guarantees are difficult to obtain for Markov Chain Monte
Carlo algorithms of common use. In this paper, we study an alternative class of

way that, at its final time, it approximates the target posterior distribution.
The stochastic differential equation that defines this process is discretized
(using a Euler scheme) to provide an efficient sampling algorithm. Our
construction of the diffusion is based on the notion of observation process and
the related idea of stochastic localization. Namely, the diffusion process
describes a sample that is conditioned on increasing information. An
overlapping family of processes was derived in the machine learning literature
via time-reversal.
  We apply this method to posterior sampling in the high-dimensional symmetric
spiked model. We observe a rank-one matrix ${\boldsymbol \theta}{\boldsymbol

computes the posterior expectation of ${\boldsymbol \theta}$ given the data and
the additional observation process. We provide an efficient implementation of
this oracle using approximate message passing. We thus develop the first

matter systems has opened up a new dimension for the field of spintronics. The
most appealing aspect of the spin-orbit coupling is the apparent Magnus force
sensed by a spin system which locks the Fermi momentum with electron spin in a
fascinating manner. In the current carrying state, the resulting macroscopic
spin polarization becomes directly accessible in the form of spin current or
spin density. At a Rashba interface, for example, a charge current shifts the
spin-locked Fermi surface, leading to a non-equilibrium spin density at the
interface, commonly known as the Rashba-Edelstein effect. Since the
Rashba-Edelstein effect is an intrinsically interface property, direct
detection of the spin moment is harder to set-up. Here we demonstrate that a
simple planar Josephson Junction geometry, realized by placing two closely
spaced superconducting electrodes on such a Rashba interface, allows a direct
estimation of strength of the non-equilibrium spin moment. Measurements of
Fraunhofer patterns of Nb-(Pt/Cu)-Nb planar Josephson junctions in a
perpendicular magnetic field showed a shift of the center of the Fraunhofer
pattern to a non-zero field value. By performing extensive control
measurements, we argue that the screening currents in the junction effectively
lock the external field with the spin moment of the Rashba-Edelstein effect
induced spin-density, leading to the observed shift in the Fraunhofer patterns.
This simple experiment offers a fresh perspective on direct detection of spin
polarization induced by various spin-orbit effects. Very interestingly, this
device platform also offers the possibility of retaining a controllable phase
at zero field in the junction without using any magnetic material, and thereby

hole) responsible for their high speed. Here we start from the observational
evidence of orbital apsidal line precession for the S2 (also called S0-2) star
to investigate on a theoretical side what level of quality in such regime of
relatively strong gravitational field is reached in the orbit angular
precession determination when using a direct orbital integration of the star
motion subjected to an acceleration computed in the post-Newtonian (PN) scheme
up to different orders. This approach, although approximated and limited to
particle speed not exceeding $\sim \ 0.3 c$, allows the inclusion of various
effects, like that of a possible spin of the central massive object. Our
results show that the inclusion of PN terms above the standard 1PN term (the
one corresponding to the classic Einstein-Schwarzschild estimate of pericenter
advance) is compulsory to determine angular precession at sufficient level of
accuracy for those penetrating stars that would allow to pick contemporary the
value of the mass and of the spin of a rotating (Kerr-like) super massive black
hole (SMBH). We discuss how future observational data, together with a proper
modelization, could allow the determination of both mass and spin of the SMBH

sensing/estimation, we propose a novel, fully data-driven Zeroth-order
Stochastic Gradient Ascent (ZoSGA) algorithm for general two-stage (i.e.,
short/long-term), fully-passive IRS-aided stochastic utility maximization.
ZoSGA learns long-term optimal IRS beamformers jointly with short-term optimal
precoders (e.g., WMMSE-based) via minimal zeroth-order reinforcement and in a
strictly model-free fashion, relying solely on the \textit{effective} compound
channels observed at the terminals, while being independent of channel models
or network/IRS configurations. Another remarkable feature of ZoSGA is being
amenable to analysis, enabling us to establish a state-of-the-art (SOTA)
convergence rate of the order of $\boldsymbol{O}(\sqrt{S}\epsilon^{-4})$ under
minimal assumptions, where $S$ is the total number of IRS elements, and
$\epsilon$ is a desired suboptimality target. Our numerical results on a
standard MISO downlink IRS-aided sumrate maximization setting establish SOTA
empirical behavior of ZoSGA as well, consistently and substantially
outperforming standard fully model-based baselines. Lastly, we demonstrate that
ZoSGA can in fact operate \textit{in the field}, by directly optimizing the
capacitances of a varactor-based electromagnetic IRS model (unknown to ZoSGA)

evolve over time under given actions. The intuition, often termed visual
intuitive physics, is a critical ability that allows us to make effective plans
to manipulate the scene to achieve desired outcomes without relying on
extensive trial and error. In this paper, we present a framework capable of
learning 3D-grounded visual intuitive physics models from videos of complex
scenes with fluids. Our method is composed of a conditional Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-style visual frontend and a 3D point-based dynamics prediction
backend, using which we can impose strong relational and structural inductive
bias to capture the structure of the underlying environment. Unlike existing
intuitive point-based dynamics works that rely on the supervision of dense
point trajectory from simulators, we relax the requirements and only assume
access to multi-view RGB images and (imperfect) instance masks acquired using
color prior. This enables the proposed model to handle scenarios where accurate
point estimation and tracking are hard or impossible. We generate datasets
including three challenging scenarios involving fluid, granular materials, and
rigid objects in the simulation. The datasets do not include any dense particle
information so most previous 3D-based intuitive physics pipelines can barely
deal with that. We show our model can make long-horizon future predictions by
learning from raw images and significantly outperforms models that do not
employ an explicit 3D representation space. We also show that once trained, our

transferring knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a fully-unlabeled
target domain. Conventional UDA approaches have two problems. The first problem
is that a class classifier can be biased to the source domain because it is
trained using only source samples. The second is that previous approaches align
image-level features regardless of foreground and background, although the
classifier requires foreground features. To solve these problems, we introduce
Weight-based Mask Network (WEMNet) composed of Domain Ignore Module (DIM) and
Semantic Enhancement Module (SEM). DIM obtains domain-agnostic feature
representations via the weight of the domain discriminator and predicts
categories. In addition, SEM obtains class-related feature representations
using the classifier weight and focuses on the foreground features for domain
adaptation. Extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed WEMNet
outperforms the competitive accuracy on representative UDA datasets.

about Ciore is that it has a strong consistency operator, that is, a
consistency operator which (forward/backward) propagates inconsistency. Also,
it turns out to be an algebraizable logic (in the sense of Blok and Pigozzi)
that can be characterized by means of a 3-valued logical matrix. Recently, a
first-order version of Ciore, namely QCiore, was defined preserving the spirit

unprecedented opportunity to map canopy height at high spatial and temporal
resolutions. Current techniques for wall-to-wall canopy height mapping
correlate remotely sensed 2D information from optical and radar sensors to the
vertical structure of trees using LiDAR measurements. While studies using deep
learning algorithms have shown promising performances for the accurate mapping
of canopy heights, they have limitations due to the type of architectures and
loss functions employed. Moreover, mapping canopy heights over tropical forests
remains poorly studied, and the accurate height estimation of tall canopies is
a challenge due to signal saturation from optical and radar sensors, persistent
cloud covers and sometimes the limited penetration capabilities of LiDARs.
Here, we map heights at 10 m resolution across the diverse landscape of Ghana
with a new vision transformer (ViT) model optimized concurrently with a
classification (discrete) and a regression (continuous) loss function. This
model achieves better accuracy than previously used convolutional based
approaches (ConvNets) optimized with only a continuous loss function. The ViT
model results show that our proposed discrete/continuous loss significantly
increases the sensitivity for very tall trees (i.e., > 35m), for which other
approaches show saturation effects. The height maps generated by the ViT also
have better ground sampling distance and better sensitivity to sparse
vegetation in comparison to a convolutional model. Our ViT model has a RMSE of
3.12m in comparison to a reference dataset while the ConvNet model has a RMSE

explained by the coupling between the baryonic matter particles in terms of the

potential. Such a quantum-corrected Yukawa-like gravitational potential is
characterized by the coupling parameter $\alpha$, the wavelength parameter
$\lambda$, which is related to the graviton mass via $m_g=\hbar/(\lambda c)$,
that determines the range of the force and, finally, a Planck length quantity
$l_0$ that makes the potential regular at the centre. The corrected Friedmann
equations are obtained using Verlinde's entropic force interpretation of
gravity based on the holographic scenario and the equipartition law of energy.
The parameter $\alpha$ modifies Newton's constant as $G_{\rm eff}\rightarrow
G(1+\alpha)$. We argue that dark matter is an apparent effect as no dark matter
particle exists in this picture. Furthermore, the dark energy is also related
to graviton mass and $\alpha$; in particular, we point out that the
cosmological constant can be viewed as a self-interaction effect between
gravitons. We further show that there exists a precise correspondence with
Verlinde's emergent gravity theory, and due to the long-range force, the theory
can be viewed as a non-local gravity theory. To this end, we performed the
phase space analyses and estimated $\lambda\simeq 10^3 $[Mpc] and $\alpha \in

mass, we get $m_g\simeq 10^{-68}$ kg, and cosmological constant $\Lambda \simeq

neural network to estimate the gravitational wave (GW) temporal evolution of
the gmode fundamental resonant frequency for a Core Collapse Supernova (CCSN).
To perform the estimation, we construct a training data set, using synthetic
waveforms, that serves to train the ML algorithm, and then use several CCSN
waveforms to test the model. According to the results obtained from the
implementation of our model, we provide numerical evidence to support the
classification of progenitors according to their degree of rotation. The
relative error associated with the estimate of the slope of the resonant
frequency versus time for the GW from CCSN signals is within $13\%$ for the
tested candidates included in this study. This method of classification does
not require priors or templates, it is based on physical modelling, and can be
combined with studies that classify the progenitor with other physical
features.

widely, and up to date, assumed ever since the discovery of SEI; rather, SEI
shows voltage-dependent differential conductance.

also address the notion of Hausdorff dimension, which is a generalization of
Euclidean dimension to non-regular sets. Finally, we present an application of
the Hausdorff measure to the Cantor ternary set, which is a classic example of

applications. Due to the high cost of model training -- such as collecting
relevant samples, labeling data, and consuming computing power --
model-stealing attack is one of the most fundamental but vitally important
issues. When it comes to quantum computing, such a quantum machine learning
(QML) model-stealing attack also exists and it is even more severe because the
traditional encryption method can hardly be directly applied to quantum
computation. On the other hand, due to the limited quantum computing resources,
the monetary cost of training QML model can be even higher than classical ones
in the near term. Therefore, a well-tuned QML model developed by a company can
be delegated to a quantum cloud provider as a service to be used by ordinary
users. In this case, the QML model will be leaked if the cloud provider is
under attack. To address such a problem, we propose a novel framework, namely
QuMoS, to preserve model security. Instead of applying encryption algorithms,
we propose to distribute the QML model to multiple physically isolated quantum
cloud providers. As such, even if the adversary in one provider can obtain a
partial model, the information of the full model is maintained in the QML
service company. Although promising, we observed an arbitrary model design

a reinforcement learning-based security engine, which can automatically
optimize the model design under the distributed setting, such that a good
trade-off between model performance and security can be made. Experimental
results on four datasets show that the model design proposed by QuMoS can
achieve a close accuracy to the model designed with neural architecture search

the spatial-temporal varying nature of highway traffic. To solve this problem,

hierarchy process [1][2][3] to evaluate the President's policy
implementation.This approach allowed us to obtain a comprehensive ranking of
the indicators [6][9][11][33]. We then quantified the index data and employed
the entropy weight method to calculate the weight of each index data. Finally,
we used the weighted total score calculation to evaluate the economic status of
the United States in a hierarchical manner after the election of Presidents
Trump and Biden [15][18]. We optimized the index system by incorporating
additional dimension indexes such as ""foreign policy"". We then crawled China's
specific development data from 1990-2020 and substituted it into the model for
analysis and evaluation. This enabled us to obtain detailed quantitative index
data of the degree of influence [10][12][14]. To address China's shortcomings
in science and technology innovation, we recommend strengthening economic

successful in training deep neural networks (DNNs). Among various attempts to
improve SGD, weight averaging (WA), which averages the weights of multiple
models, has recently received much attention in the literature. Broadly, WA
falls into two categories: 1) online WA, which averages the weights of multiple
models trained in parallel, is designed for reducing the gradient communication
overhead of parallel mini-batch SGD, and 2) offline WA, which averages the
weights of one model at different checkpoints, is typically used to improve the
generalization ability of DNNs. Though online and offline WA are similar in
form, they are seldom associated with each other. Besides, these methods
typically perform either offline parameter averaging or online parameter
averaging, but not both. In this work, we firstly attempt to incorporate online
and offline WA into a general training framework termed Hierarchical Weight
Averaging (HWA). By leveraging both the online and offline averaging manners,
HWA is able to achieve both faster convergence speed and superior
generalization performance without any fancy learning rate adjustment. Besides,
we also analyze the issues faced by existing WA methods, and how our HWA
address them, empirically. Finally, extensive experiments verify that HWA
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly.

Personalized federated learning (PFL) balances personalization and
generalization in the process of optimizing the global model, to guide the

distributions of semantics and context, which may cause the local model to
learn deviated semantic and context information. In this paper, we propose
FedSUMM, a dynamic gradient adapter to provide more appropriate local

to prevent parameter leakage during distributed training. Experimental evidence
verifies FedSUMM can achieve faster model convergence on PFL algorithm for

capture sequential information of user interactions effectively and

common approach is to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled images to augment
the training data. However, the noisy pseudo-labels will lead to cumulative
classification errors and aggravate the local inconsistency in prediction. This
paper proposes a Region Relevance Network (RRN) to alleviate the problem
mentioned above. Specifically, we first introduce a local pseudo-label
filtering module that leverages discriminator networks to assess the accuracy
of the pseudo-label at the region level. A local selection loss is proposed to
mitigate the negative impact of wrong pseudo-labels in consistency
regularization training. In addition, we propose a dynamic region-loss
correction module, which takes the merit of network diversity to further rate
the reliability of pseudo-labels and correct the convergence direction of the
segmentation network with a dynamic region loss. Extensive experiments are
conducted on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets with varying amounts of
labeled data, demonstrating that our proposed approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to current counterparts.

  Galaxy Properties",,,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ongoing and upcoming galaxy surveys are providing precision measurements of
galaxy clustering. However a major obstacle in its cosmological application is
the stochasticity in the galaxy bias. We explore whether the principal
component analysis (PCA) of galaxy correlation matrix in hyperspace of galaxy
properties (e.g. magnitude and color) can reveal further information on
mitigating this issue. Based on the hydrodynamic simulation TNG300-1, we
analyze the cross power spectrum matrix of galaxies in the magnitude and color
space of multiple photometric bands. (1) We find that the first principal
component $E_i^{(1)}$ is an excellent proxy of the galaxy deterministic bias
$b_{D}$, in that $E_i^{(1)}=\sqrt{\lambda^P(1)/P_{mm}}b_{D,i}$. Here $i$
denotes the $i$-th galaxy sub-sample. $\lambda^{(1)}$ is the largest eigenvalue
and $P_{mm}$ is the matter power spectrum. We verify that this relation holds
for all the galaxy samples investigated, down to $k\sim 2h/$Mpc. Since
$E_i^{(1)}$ is a direct observable, we can utilize it to design a linear
weighting scheme to suppress the stochasticity in the galaxy-matter relation.
For an LSST-like magnitude limit galaxy sample, the stochasticity
$\mathcal{S}\equiv 1-r^2$ can be suppressed by a factor of $\ga 2$ at
$k=1h/$Mpc. This reduces the stochasticity-induced systematic error in the
matter power spectrum reconstruction combining galaxy clustering and
galaxy-galaxy lensing from $\sim 12\%$ to $\sim 5\%$ at $k=1h/$Mpc. (2) We also
find that $\mathcal{S}$ increases monotonically with $f_\lambda$ and
$f_{\lambda^2}$. $f_{\lambda,\lambda^2}$ quantify the fractional contribution
of other eigenmodes to the galaxy clustering and are direct observables.
Therefore the two provide extra information on mitigating galaxy stochasticity.

coalescence and coarsening. To focus on coarsening, coalescence can be
suppressed by using suitable surfactants, but it is more difficult to suppress
drainage, especially in wet foams where the liquid volume fraction is so large
that bubbles are approximately spherical. To investigate the structure and time
evolution of such foams, we have performed experiments in the International
Space Station. Our observations reveal an unexpected excess of small bubbles,
moving in the interstices of the randomly close-packed network of larger
bubbles. These ""roaming bubbles"" naturally appear during the coarsening
process. They were seemingly overlooked in previous ground-based foam
coarsening experiments. We have indeed detected roaming bubbles by performing
complementary studies of moderately wet foams $\phi \lesssim 10\%$ where
gravity can be counteracted on Earth by sample rotation. In foams with liquid
fractions beyond the random close packing fraction of sphere dispersions with
the same polydispersity as in our samples ($\phi > \phi_{\text{rcp}}$), the
excess of small bubbles disappears, but we observe that bubbles still tend to
remain connected due to weak adhesive interactions. A second transition is
observed at a larger liquid fraction $\phi^*$, above which the bubble size
distribution narrows, becoming similar to the one previously reported for
dilute coarsening dispersions (Ostwald ripening regime). We present models that
identify the physical mechanisms explaining our observations. Our results
suggest that, when solidified, coarsened wet liquid foams naturally have both
macropores (foam bubbles) and micropores (roaming bubbles). Materials with such
hierarchical structures can exhibit enhanced mechanical strength to density
ratios.

if camera spectral sensitivities were known. As consumer cameras are not
designed for high-precision visual tasks, manufacturers do not disclose
spectral sensitivities. Their estimation requires a costly optical setup, which
triggered researchers to come up with numerous indirect methods that aim to
lower cost and complexity by using color targets. However, the use of color
targets gives rise to new complications that make the estimation more
difficult, and consequently, there currently exists no simple, low-cost, robust
go-to method for spectral sensitivity estimation. Furthermore, even if not
limited by hardware or cost, researchers frequently work with imagery from
multiple cameras that they do not have in their possession. To provide a
practical solution to this problem, we propose a framework for spectral
sensitivity estimation that not only does not require any hardware, but also
does not require physical access to the camera itself. Similar to other work,
we formulate an optimization problem that minimizes a two-term objective
function: a camera-specific term from a system of equations, and a universal
term that bounds the solution space. Different than other work, we use publicly
available high-quality calibration data to construct both terms. We use the
colorimetric mapping matrices provided by the Adobe DNG Converter to formulate
the camera-specific system of equations, and constrain the solutions using an
autoencoder trained on a database of ground-truth curves. On average, we
achieve reconstruction errors as low as those that can arise due to
manufacturing imperfections between two copies of the same camera. We provide

controllers, which drive a deterministic system operating in an unknown
environment to safely reach a desired target set. The approach falls within the
reachability analysis framework and is based on the computation of
inner-approximations of controlled reach-avoid sets(CRSs). Given a target set
and a safe set, the controlled reach-avoid set is the set of states such that
starting from each of them, there exists at least one controller to ensure that
the system can enter the target set while staying inside the safe set before
the target hitting time. Therefore, the boundary of the controlled reach-avoid
set acts as a barrier, which separating states capable of achieving the
reach-avoid objective from those that are not, and thus the computed
inner-approximation provides a viable space for the system to achieve the
reach-avoid objective. Our approach for synthesizing reach-avoid controllers
mainly consists of three steps. We first learn a safe set of states in the
unknown environment from sensor measurements based on a support vector machine
approach. Then, based on the learned safe set and target set, we compute an
inner-approximation of the CRS. Finally, we synthesize controllers online to
ensure that the system will reach the target set by evolving inside the
computed inner-approximation. The proposed method is demonstrated on a Dubin's
car system.

depending on the probability distribution $P$ of the given information source
and the distortion measure $d(x,y)$. The reason for the discontinuity in the
error exponent is that there exists $(d,\Delta)$ such that the rate-distortion
function $R(\Delta|P)$ is neither concave nor quasi-concave with respect to
$P$. Arimoto's algorithm for computing the error exponent in lossy source
coding is based on Blahut's parametric representation of the error exponent.
However, Blahut's parametric representation is a lower convex envelope of
Marton's exponent, and the two do not generally agree. The contribution of this
paper is to provide a parametric representation that perfectly matches with the
inverse function of Marton's exponent, thus avoiding the problem of the
rate-distortion function being non-convex with respect to $P$. The optimal
distribution for fixed parameters can be obtained using Arimoto's algorithm.
Performing a nonconvex optimization over the parameters successfully yields the

time-series as stochastic or non-stochastic, to understand the underlying
physical process. Content-aware conversion of 1D time-series to 2D
representation, that simultaneously utilizes time- and frequency-domain
characteristics, is proposed. An autoencoder is trained with a loss function to
learn latent space (using both time- and frequency domains) representation,
that is designed to be, time-invariant. Every element of the time-series is
represented as a tuple with two components, one each, from latent space
representation in time- and frequency-domains, forming a binary image. In this
binary image, those tuples that represent the points in the time-series,
together form the ``Latent Space Signature"" (LSS) of the input time-series. The
obtained binary LSS images are fed to a classification network. The
EfficientNetv2-S classifier is trained using 421 synthetic time-series, with
fair representation from both categories. The proposed methodology is evaluated
on publicly available astronomical data which are 12 distinct temporal classes
of time-series pertaining to the black hole GRS 1915 + 105, obtained from RXTE
satellite. Results obtained using the proposed methodology are compared with
existing techniques. Concurrence in labels obtained across the classes,
illustrates the efficacy of the proposed 2D representation using the latent
space co-ordinates. The proposed methodology also outputs the confidence in the

sophisticated components like ML-based controllers. It is difficult to provide

\RAP's decision component evaluates the system's safety risk and whenever the
risk is higher than acceptable the RTA switches to a safety mode that, for
example, activates a controller with strong evidence for its safe functioning.
In this way, RTAs increase CPS runtime safety and resilience by recovering the

more detailed study of the process by measuring the cross sections for
polarized $Z$ in order to measure possible anomalous $ZZH$ couplings. We show
that certain combinations of cross sections in $e^+e^- \to ZH$ with different
$Z$ polarizations help to enhance or isolate the effect of one of the two kinds
of anomalous $ZZH$ couplings possible on general grounds of CP and Lorentz
invariance. These combinations can be useful to get information on the $ZZH$
coupling in the specific contexts of an effective field theory,
two-Higgs-doublet models, and composite Higgs models, in a relatively
model-independent fashion. We find in particular that the longitudinal helicity
fraction of the $Z$ is expected to be insensitive to anomalous couplings, and
would be close to its value in the standard model in the scenarios we consider.
We also discuss the sensitivity of the proposed measurements to the anomalous
couplings, including longitudinal beam polarizations, which suppress

Hence, by solving just these archetypal problems on the hardware on which the
MPC is to be deployed, and by recording the execution times, we obtain the

validate the method on an MPC example where an inverted pendulum on a cart is
stabilized. The experiments highlight the following advantages compared with

galaxy masses emerged using models that evolve under gas accretion from host
halos. They also include ejection of interstellar matter by supernova feedback,
recycling of ejected matter and preventive feedback that partially hinders gas
accretion. We consider three schemes of gas accretion: the fiducial scheme
which includes the accretion of cold gas in low-mass halos and high-redshift
massive halos as hinted by cosmological simulations; the flat scheme in which
high-mass cold accretion is removed; and finally the shock-heating scheme which
assumes radiative cooling of the shock-heated halo gas. The fiducial scheme
reproduces dramatic diminishment in star formation rate (SFR) after its peak as
observed for the present halo mass $M_{\rm vir}>10^{12.5}{\rm M}_\odot$ while
other two schemes show reduced or negligible quenching. This scheme reproduces
the high-mass slope in the SFR vs. stellar mass relation decreasing toward
recent epochs whereas other two schemes show opposite trend which contradicts
observation. Success in the fiducial scheme originates in the existence of
high-mass cold-mode accretion which retards transition to the slow hot-mode
accretion thereby inducing a larger drop in SFR. Aided by gas recycling, which
creates monotonically increasing SFR in low-mass halos, this scheme can
reproduce the downsizing galaxy formation. Several issues remain, suggesting
non-negligible roles of missing physics. Feedback from active galactic nuclei
could mitigate upturn of SFR in low-redshift massive halos whereas galaxy
mergers could remedy early inefficient star formation.

the massively generated GPS trajectory data provide a core support for
advancing spatial-temporal data mining research. Nonetheless, GPS trajectories
comprise personal geo-location information, rendering inevitable privacy
concerns on plain data. One promising solution to this problem is trajectory
generation, replacing the original data with the generated privacy-free ones.
However, owing to the complex and stochastic behavior of human activities,
generating high-quality trajectories is still in its infancy. To achieve the
objective, we propose a diffusion-based trajectory generation (Diff-Traj)
framework, effectively integrating the generation capability of the diffusion
model and learning from the spatial-temporal features of trajectories.
Specifically, we gradually convert real trajectories to noise through a forward
trajectory noising process. Then, Diff-Traj reconstructs forged trajectories
from the noise by a reverse trajectory denoising process. In addition, we
design a trajectory UNet (Traj-UNet) structure to extract trajectory features
for noise level prediction during the reverse process. Experiments on two
real-world datasets show that Diff-Traj can be intuitively applied to generate
high-quality trajectories while retaining the original distribution.

It synchronizes 3D proposal generation and center-ness score prediction by a

the training of the center-ness branch, which enhances the network's
discriminative ability to distinguish proposals of different quality. Besides,
we design a binary target classifier to identify target-relevant points. By
integrating the derived classification scores with the center-ness scores, the

mitigate task misalignment. Finally, we present a novel one-stage Siamese

parametrizations of positive steady states of these systems that follow
mass-action kinetics. In this work, we consider deriving positive steady states
of networks with kinetics that may include polynomials, quotients, and mixed
kinetics. For instance, mixed kinetics occurs when some reactions follow the
mass-action kinetics while on the other hand, some reactions within the same
network follow quotient rate laws. This is the case of a complex mathematical
model of insulin signaling pathway in type 2 diabetes. To derive its positive
steady states, we modify our previous approach, which employs network
decomposition, to handle networks with non-mass-action kinetics. Such an
approach breaks a given network into smaller independent subnetworks so that we
first derive the positive steady states of these subnetworks individually, and
then combine them to get the positive steady states of the whole network. This
makes the computation become more manageable for complex and large networks.
Importantly, this could separate reactions with purely mass-action into certain
subnetworks from those reactions that follow different rate laws. Finally, we
also discuss the possibility of considering transformations of networks with
non-mass-action kinetics and study their associated (e.g., dynamically
equivalent) networks with mass-action kinetics.

several potential directions to pave the way for future SNA research.

leading to a severely underdetermined image reconstruction problem. In such
cases, conventional methods generate reconstructions with significant
artifacts. In order to remove these artifacts, regularization methods must be
applied that beneficially incorporate additional information. An important
example of such methods is TV reconstruction. It is well-known that this
technique can efficiently compensate for the missing data and reduce
reconstruction artifacts. At the same time, however, tomographic data is also
contaminated by noise, which poses an additional challenge. The use of a single
penalty term (regularizer) within a variational regularization framework must
therefore account for both, the missing data and the noise. However, a single
regularizer may not be ideal for both tasks. For example, the TV regularizer is
a poor choice for noise reduction across different scales, in which case
$\ell^1$-curvelet regularization methods work well. To address this issue, in
this paper we introduce a novel variational regularization framework that
combines the advantages of two different regularizers. The basic idea of our
framework is to perform reconstruction in two stages, where the first stage
mainly aims at accurate reconstruction in the presence of noise, and the second
stage aims at artifact reduction. Both reconstruction stages are connected by a
data consistency condition, which makes them close to each other in the data
domain. The proposed method is implemented and tested for limited view CT using
a combined curvelet-TV-approach. To this end, we define and implement a

graphs constructed from a cycle graph, wherein each node is connected to pairs
of neighbors that are spaced progressively in terms of vertex degree. This kind
of network topology is extensively adopted in several graph-based distributed
scalable protocols and their spectral properties often play a central role in
the determination of convergence rates for such algorithms. In this work, basic
properties of RRL graphs and the eigenvalues of the corresponding Laplacian and
Randi\'{c} matrices are investigated. A deep characterization for the spectra
of these matrices is given and their relation with the Dirichlet kernel is
illustrated. Consequently, the Fiedler value of such a network topology is
found analytically. With regard to RRLs, properties on the bounds for the
spectral radius of the Laplacian matrix and the essential spectral radius of
the Randi\'{c} matrix are also provided, proposing interesting conjectures on
the latter quantities.

generation. This research proposes to condense video generation into a problem
of motion generation, to improve the expressiveness of motion and make video
generation more manageable. This can be achieved by breaking down the video
generation process into latent motion generation and video reconstruction. We
present a latent motion diffusion (LaMD) framework, which consists of a
motion-decomposed video autoencoder and a diffusion-based motion generator, to
implement this idea. Through careful design, the motion-decomposed video
autoencoder can compress patterns in movement into a concise latent motion
representation. Meanwhile, the diffusion-based motion generator is able to
efficiently generate realistic motion on a continuous latent space under
multi-modal conditions, at a cost that is similar to that of image diffusion
models. Results show that LaMD generates high-quality videos with a wide range
of motions, from stochastic dynamics to highly controllable movements. It
achieves new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, including
BAIR, Landscape and CATER-GENs, for Image-to-Video (I2V) and
Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) generation. The source code of LaMD will be made
available soon.

consistent normal orientations starting from a set of completely random
normals. By taking the vertices of the Voronoi diagram of the point cloud as

winding number is either 0 or 1, (2) the occurrences of 1 and the occurrences
of 0 are balanced around the point cloud, and (3) the normals align with the
outside Voronoi poles as much as possible. Extensive experimental results show
that our method outperforms the existing approaches, especially in handling
sparse and noisy point clouds, as well as shapes with complex

and unpredictable user behavior. In dynamic setups, users can freely depart and
enter the network at any moment. The shared caching concept has the potential
to handle this issue by assigning $K$ users to $P$ caching profiles, where all
$\eta_{p}$ users assigned to profile $p$ store the same cache content defined
by that profile. The existing schemes, however, cannot be applied in general
and are not dynamic in the true sense as they put constraints on the
transmitter-side spatial multiplexing gain $\alpha$. Specifically, they work
only if $\alpha \leq \min_{p} \eta_{p}$ or $\alpha \geq \hat{\eta}$, where in
the latter case, $\gamma$ is the normalized cache size of each user,
$\hat{\eta}$ is an arbitrary parameter satisfying $1 \leq \hat{\eta} \leq
\max_{p} \eta_{p}$, and the extra condition of $\alpha \geq K\gamma$ should
also be met. In this work, we propose a universal caching scheme based on the
same shared-cache model that can be applied to any dynamic setup, extending the
working region of existing schemes to networks with $\min_{p} \eta_{p} \leq
\alpha \leq \hat{\eta}$ and removing any other constraints of existing schemes.
We also derive the closed-form expressions for the achievable
degrees-of-freedom (DoF) of the proposed scheme and show that it achieves the

valuable assets. Vulnerabilities in smart contracts can be costly, as time has
shown over and over again. Countermeasures are high in demand and include best
practice recommendations as well as tools supporting development, program
verification, and post-deployment analysis. Many tools focus on detecting the
absence or presence of a subset of the known vulnerabilities, delivering
results of varying quality. Most comparative tool evaluations resort to
selecting a handful of tools and testing them against each other. In the best
case, the evaluation is based on a smallish ground truth. For Ethereum, there
are commendable efforts by several author groups to manually classify
contracts. However, a comprehensive ground truth is still lacking. In this
work, we construct a ground truth based on publicly available benchmark sets
for Ethereum smart contracts with manually checked ground truth data. We
develop a method to unify these sets. Additionally, we devise strategies for
matching entries that pertain to the same contract, such that we can determine
overlaps and disagreements between the sets and consolidate the disagreements.
Finally, we assess the quality of the included ground truth sets. Our work
reduces inconsistencies, redundancies, and incompleteness while increasing the
number of data points and heterogeneity.

the perspective of energy transformation, involved with several dynamical
processes. We find that on rapidly rotating, tidally locked terrestrial
planets, mean potential energy (P$_{\rm M}$) and eddy potential energy (P$_{\rm
E}$) are comparable to those on Earth, as they have similar steep meridional
temperature gradients. Mean kinetic energy (K$_{\rm M}$) and eddy kinetic
energy (K$_{\rm E}$) are larger than those on Earth, related to stronger winds.
The two conversion paths, P$_{\rm M}\rightarrow$P$_{\rm E}\rightarrow$K$_{\rm
E}$ and P$_{\rm M}\rightarrow$K$_{\rm M}\rightarrow$K$_{\rm E}$, are both
efficient. The former is associated with strong baroclinic instabilities, and
the latter is associated with Hadley cells. On slowly rotating, tidally locked
terrestrial planets, weak temperature gradients in the free atmosphere and
strong nightside temperature inversion make P$_{\rm M}$ and P$_{\rm E}$ are
much smaller than those on Earth. Meanwhile, large day--night surface
temperature contrast and small rotation rate make the overturning circulation
extend to the globe, so that the main conversion path is P$_{\rm

analyses improve the understanding of the atmospheric circulation on tidally

  Calibration Accuracy based on Multi-Planal Constraints","7",,,,"cs.RO eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the widespread application of industrial robots, the problem of absolute
positioning accuracy becomes increasingly prominent. To ensure the working
state of the robots, researchers commonly adopt calibration techniques to
improve its accuracy. However, an industrial robot's working space is mostly
restricted in real working environments, making the collected samples fail in
covering the actual working space to result in the overall migration data. To
address this vital issue, this work proposes a novel industrial robot
calibrator that integrates a measurement configurations selection (MCS) method
and an alternation-direction-method-of-multipliers with multiple planes
constraints (AMPC) algorithm into its working process, whose ideas are
three-fold: a) selecting a group of optimal measurement configurations based on
the observability index to suppress the measurement noises, b) developing an
AMPC algorithm that evidently enhances the calibration accuracy and suppresses
the long-tail convergence, and c) proposing an industrial robot calibration
algorithm that incorporates MCS and AMPC to optimize an industrial robot's
kinematic parameters efficiently. For validating its performance, a
public-available dataset (HRS-P) is established on an HRS-JR680 industrial
robot. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed calibrator
outperforms several state-of-the-art models in calibration accuracy.

how to compete with humans, less on exploring how to collaborate with humans.
To this end, this paper makes the first attempt to investigate human-agent

agents to collaborate through explicit communication by designing an efficient
and interpretable Meta-Command Communication-based framework, dubbed MCC, for
accomplishing effective human-agent collaboration in MOBA games. The MCC
framework consists of two pivotal modules: 1) an interpretable communication
protocol, i.e., the Meta-Command, to bridge the communication gap between
humans and agents; 2) a meta-command value estimator, i.e., the Meta-Command
Selector, to select a valuable meta-command for each agent to achieve effective
human-agent collaboration. Experimental results in Honor of Kings demonstrate
that MCC agents can collaborate reasonably well with human teammates and even
generalize to collaborate with different levels and numbers of human teammates.

specific feature of the GC-FETs under consideration is relatively low energy
BLs and the possibility to optimize the device characteristics by choosing the
barriers containing a necessary number of the b-As$_x$P$_{1-x}$ atomic layers

enhancement of the detector responsivity. The room temperature responsivity can
exceed the values of $10^3$~A/W. The speed of the GC-FET detector's response to

quality and active development time connected to Jira issues. [Results] Most
source code changes are made by either a marginal or dominant code owner. Also,
most changes to low-quality source code are made by developers with low levels

Collective code ownership is a popular target, but industry practice results in

behaviors, in which interactions between individuals are governed by the
underlying social connections. It is well known that, based on the information

strategically imitating superior behaviors and changing unfavorable
surroundings in self-organizing ways. However, facing the tough situation that
some humans and social bots keep spreading misinformation, we still lack the
systematic investigation on the impact of such proliferation of misinformation
on the evolution of social cooperation. Here we study this problem by virtue of
classical evolutionary game theory. We find that misinformation generally
impedes the emergence of collective cooperation compared to scenarios with
completely true information, although the level of cooperation is slightly
higher when the benefits provided by cooperators are reduced below a proven
threshold. We further show that this possible advantage shrinks as social
connections become denser, suggesting that misinformation is more detrimental
to the formation of collective cooperation when 'social viscosity' is low. Our
results uncover the quantitative effect of misinformation on the social
cooperative behavior in the complex networked society, and pave the way for
designing possible interventions to improve collective cooperation.

first-order logic of imperfect information to describe game-theoretic phenomena
underlying the semantics of natural language. The logic allows for expressing
independence constraints among quantified variables, in a similar vein to
Henkin quantifiers, and has a nice game-theoretic semantics in terms of
imperfect information games. However, the IF semantics exhibits some
limitations. It treats the players asymmetrically, considering only one of the
two players as having imperfect information when evaluating truth, resp.,
falsity, of a sentence. In addition, the truth and falsity of sentences
coincide with the existence of a uniform winning strategy for one of the two
players in the semantic imperfect information game. As a consequence, IF does
admit undetermined sentences, which are neither true nor false, thus failing
the law of excluded middle. In this paper, we investigate an extension of IF,
called Alternating Dependence/Independence Friendly Logic (ADIF), tailored to
overcome these limitations. To this end, we introduce a novel compositional
semantics, generalising the one based on trumps proposed by Hodges for IF. The
new semantics (i) allows for meaningfully restricting both players at the same

the law of excluded middle for sentences, and (iv) grants ADIF the full

  Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The discriminability of feature representation is the key to open-set face
recognition. Previous methods rely on the learnable weights of the
classification layer that represent the identities. However, the evaluation
process learns no identity representation and drops the classifier from
training. This inconsistency could confuse the feature encoder in understanding
the evaluation goal and hinder the effect of identity-based methods. To
alleviate the above problem, we propose a novel approach namely Contrastive
Regularization for Face recognition (CoReFace) to apply image-level
regularization in feature representation learning. Specifically, we employ
sample-guided contrastive learning to regularize the training with the
image-image relationship directly, which is consistent with the evaluation
process. To integrate contrastive learning into face recognition, we augment
embeddings instead of images to avoid the image quality degradation. Then, we
propose a novel contrastive loss for the representation distribution by
incorporating an adaptive margin and a supervised contrastive mask to generate
steady loss values and avoid the collision with the classification supervision
signal. Finally, we discover and solve the semantically repetitive signal
problem in contrastive learning by exploring new pair coupling protocols.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our CoReFace
which is highly competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches.

DeepFake improves by leaps and bounds,more and more DeepFake detection
techniques have been proposed. These methods typically rely on detecting
statistical differences between natural (i.e., real) and DeepFakegenerated
images in both spatial and frequency domains. In this work, we propose to
explicitly minimize the statistical differences to evade state-of-the-art
DeepFake detectors. To this end, we propose a statistical consistency attack
(StatAttack) against DeepFake detectors, which contains two main parts. First,
we select several statistical-sensitive natural degradations (i.e., exposure,
blur, and noise) and add them to the fake images in an adversarial way. Second,
we find that the statistical differences between natural and DeepFake images
are positively associated with the distribution shifting between the two kinds
of images, and we propose to use a distribution-aware loss to guide the
optimization of different degradations. As a result, the feature distributions
of generated adversarial examples is close to the natural images.Furthermore,
we extend the StatAttack to a more powerful version, MStatAttack, where we
extend the single-layer degradation to multi-layer degradations sequentially
and use the loss to tune the combination weights jointly. Comprehensive
experimental results on four spatial-based detectors and two frequency-based
detectors with four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
attack method in both white-box and black-box settings.

residual feature extraction via recurrent learning to perform both feature

demonstrate that, after the initial reconstruction, feature maps with reduced

a significant reduction in the amount of memory required. Extensive experiments

large language models (LLMs) motivates us to study how far this challenge can
be addressed by ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art LLM. Unfortunately, our study shows
that ChatGPT has a low probability (28.8%) of finding correct failure-inducing

failure-inducing test cases requires analyzing the subtle code differences
between a buggy program and its correct version. When these two versions have
similar syntax, ChatGPT is weak at recognizing subtle code differences. Our
insight is that ChatGPT's performance can be substantially enhanced when
ChatGPT is guided to focus on the subtle code difference. We have an

non-radiative amplitude. This generalises the Low-Burnett-Kroll (LBK) theorem
for QED to all orders. All hard matching corrections can be calculated by
applying the LBK differential operator to the non-radiative amplitude. The
virtual corrections in the effective theory vanish beyond one loop, resulting
in a one-loop exact soft function. As a first, non-trivial application we
calculate the real-virtual-virtual electron-line corrections to muon-electron
scattering at NLP in the soft limit.

interpreting neurons than current manual methods, that will better scale these
methods to Large Language Models (LLMs). We use truncation and saliency methods
to only present the important tokens, and augment the dataset examples with
more diverse samples to better capture the extent of neuron behaviour. These
graphs can be visualised to aid manual interpretation by researchers, but can
also output token activations on text to compare to the neuron's ground truth

First, a single-chamber structure composed of a micro-perforated panel and an

finite element method. Second, for the sake of enlarging the continuous
absorption bandwidth with absorption coefficients not less than 0.8, a
three-chamber structure is designed, which has a sound absorption bandwidth of
1277Hz (27-1304Hz) covering 5.6 octave bands. Then, the transfer function model
of the structure is established, and a series of theoretical formulae are
derived to calculate the absorption coefficients. Subsequently, the sound
absorption bandwidths calculated by the theoretical formulae and the finite

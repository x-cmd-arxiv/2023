of medical CT and significantly improves conventional (single-energy) CT.
Spectral CT has two main forms: dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) and
photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT), which offer image improvement,
material decomposition, and feature quantification relative to conventional CT.
However, the inherent challenges of spectral CT, evidenced by data and image
artifacts, remain a bottleneck for clinical applications. To address these
problems, machine learning techniques have been widely applied to spectral CT.
In this review, we present the state-of-the-art data-driven techniques for

code-generation ability, they still struggle with complex tasks. In real-world
software development, humans usually tackle complex tasks through collaborative
teamwork, a strategy that significantly controls development complexity and
enhances software quality. Inspired by this, we present a self-collaboration
framework for code generation employing LLMs, exemplified by ChatGPT.
Specifically, through role instructions, 1) Multiple LLMs act as distinct
``experts'', each responsible for a specific subtask within a complex task; 2)
Specify the way to collaborate and interact, so that different roles form a
virtual team to facilitate each other's work, ultimately the virtual team
addresses code generation tasks collaboratively without the need for human
intervention. To effectively organize and manage this virtual team, we
incorporate software-development methodology into the framework. Thus, we
assemble an elementary team consisting of three ChatGPT roles (i.e., analyst,
coder, and tester) responsible for software development's analysis, coding, and
testing stages. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various code-generation
benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that self-collaboration code
generation relatively improves 29.9%-47.1% Pass@1 compared to direct code
generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance and even surpassing GPT-4.
Moreover, we showcase that self-collaboration could potentially enable LLMs to
efficiently handle complex real-world tasks that are not readily solved by
direct code generation, as evidenced in case study.

networks to approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. As
data-driven models, neural operators require the generation of labeled

high-dimensional datasets containing redundant and noisy features, which can
hinder gradient-based optimization. Mapping these high-dimensional datasets to
a low-dimensional latent space of salient features can make it easier to work
with the data and also enhance learning. In this work, we investigate the
latent deep operator network (L-DeepONet), an extension of standard DeepONet,
which leverages latent representations of high-dimensional PDE input and output
functions identified with suitable autoencoders. We illustrate that L-DeepONet
outperforms the standard approach in terms of both accuracy and computational

  algorithm for vehicle driving simulation",,,,,"cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the field of motion simulation, the level of immersion strongly depends on
the motion cueing algorithm (MCA), as it transfers the reference motion of the
simulated vehicle to a motion of the motion simulation platform (MSP). The
challenge for the MCA is to reproduce the motion perception of a real vehicle
driver as accurately as possible without exceeding the limits of the workspace
of the MSP in order to provide a realistic virtual driving experience. In case
of a large discrepancy between the perceived motion signals and the optical
cues, motion sickness may occur with the typical symptoms of nausea, dizziness,
headache and fatigue. Existing approaches either produce non-optimal results,
e.g., due to filtering, linearization, or simplifications, or the required
computational time exceeds the real-time requirements of a closed-loop
application.
  In this work a new solution is presented, where not a human designer
specifies the principles of the MCA but an artificial intelligence (AI) learns
the optimal motion by trial and error in an interaction with the MSP. To
achieve this, deep reinforcement learning (RL) is applied, where an agent
interacts with an environment formulated as a Markov decision process~(MDP).
This allows the agent to directly control a simulated MSP to obtain feedback on
its performance in terms of platform workspace usage and the motion acting on
the simulator user. The RL algorithm used is proximal policy optimization
(PPO), where the value function and the policy corresponding to the control
strategy are learned and both are mapped in artificial neural networks (ANN).
This approach is implemented in Python and the functionality is demonstrated by
the practical example of pre-recorded lateral maneuvers. The subsequent
validation on a standardized double lane change shows that the RL algorithm is
able to learn the control strategy and improve the quality of...

magnon squeezing effect led by temperature and anisotropy for all two-mode
energy eigenbasis states of the system. While temperature induces amplitude
squeezing, anisotropy causes phase squeezing in magnon states. We show that the
anisotropy gives rise to the larger squeeze factor compared to temperature.
However, it is seen that temperature-induced squeezing is naturally related to
the squeezed property of the two-mode magnon states. The analysis shows that
after a sharp squeezing effect up to a finite value of anisotropy, increasing
anisotropy beyond this value does not cause significant further squeezing.
Nevertheless, increasing the temperature continuously causes compression.
Despite the competition between temperature and anisotropy -induced squeezings,
we show that an optimal finite value of anisotropy allows achieving high

categories of inverse problems concerning a physical system are (1) estimate
parameters in a model of the system from observed input-output pairs and (2)
given a model of the system, reconstruct the input to it that caused some
observed output. Applied inverse problems are challenging because a solution
may (i) not exist, (ii) not be unique, or (iii) be sensitive to measurement
noise contaminating the data.
  Bayesian statistical inversion (BSI) is an approach to tackle ill-posed
and/or ill-conditioned inverse problems. Advantageously, BSI provides a
""solution"" that (i) quantifies uncertainty by assigning a probability to each
possible value of the unknown parameter/input and (ii) incorporates prior
information and beliefs about the parameter/input.
  Herein, we provide a tutorial of BSI for inverse problems, by way of
illustrative examples dealing with heat transfer from ambient air to a cold
lime fruit. First, we use BSI to infer a parameter in a dynamic model of the
lime temperature from measurements of the lime temperature over time. Second,
we use BSI to reconstruct the initial condition of the lime from a measurement
of its temperature later in time. We demonstrate the incorporation of prior
information, visualize the posterior distributions of the parameter/initial
condition, and show posterior samples of lime temperature trajectories from the
model. Our tutorial aims to reach a wide range of scientists and engineers.

connectionist temporal classification (CTC) and attention-based encoder-decoder

autoregressive mechanism for token generation and thus are relatively slow
during inference. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of a CTC
Alignment-based Single-Step Non-Autoregressive Transformer (CASS-NAT) for
end-to-end ASR. In CASS-NAT, word embeddings in the autoregressive transformer
(AT) are substituted with token-level acoustic embeddings (TAE) that are
extracted from encoder outputs with the acoustical boundary information offered
by the CTC alignment. TAE can be obtained in parallel, resulting in a parallel
generation of output tokens. During training, Viterbi-alignment is used for TAE
generation, and multiple training strategies are further explored to improve
the word error rate (WER) performance. During inference, an error-based
alignment sampling method is investigated in depth to reduce the alignment
mismatch in the training and testing processes. Experimental results show that
the CASS-NAT has a WER that is close to AT on various ASR tasks, while
providing a ~24x inference speedup. With and without self-supervised learning,
we achieve new state-of-the-art results for non-autoregressive models on
several datasets. We also analyze the behavior of the CASS-NAT decoder to
explain why it can perform similarly to AT. We find that TAEs have similar
functionality to word embeddings for grammatical structures, which might
indicate the possibility of learning some semantic information from TAEs
without a language model.

celsius (C) of warming is exceeded. Carbon release from substantial permafrost
stocks vulnerable to near-term warming represents a positive climate feedback
that may increase the risk of 1.5 C warming or greater. Methane (CH4) is a
short-lived but powerful greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 28.5
times that of carbon dioxide (CO2) over a 100 year time span. Because
permafrost thaw in the coming centuries is partly determined by the warming in
the 21st century, rapid reductions in methane emissions early in the 21st
century could have far reaching effects. We use a reduced complexity carbon
cycle model and a permafrost feedback module to explore the possibility that
accelerating reductions in methane emissions could help avoid long-term warming
by limiting permafrost melt. We simulate 3 extended Representative
Concentration Pathway (RCP) emission scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 6) through
the year 2300 and impose methane mitigation strategies where we reduce CH4
emissions by 1%, 5% or 10% annually until the long-term scenario emission level
is reached. We find that accelerated rates of methane mitigation do not
sufficiently alter the global temperature anomaly to prevent or delay a
permafrost feedback, nor do they result in meaningful long term reductions in
temperatures. We find that the long-term magnitude of methane mitigation (i.e.,
long-term emission level) and not the rate of reduction, corresponds to
long-term temperature change. Therefore, policy and mitigation efforts should
emphasize durable decreases in methane emissions over rapidity of
implementation.

cross-correlation to the spectra predicted by astrophysical models. We apply a

Inspired by recent work of the second author and Nam Trang, we introduce a new
technique for establishing generic absoluteness results for models containing
$\Gamma^\infty$.
  Our main technical tool is an iteration that realizes $\Gamma^\infty$ as the
sets of reals in a derived model of some iterate of $V$. We show, from a
supercompact cardinal $\kappa$ and a proper class of Woodin cardinals, that
whenever $g \subseteq Col(\omega, 2^{2^\kappa})$ is $V$-generic and $h$ is
$V[g]$-generic for some poset $\mathbb{P}\in V[g]$, there is an elementary
embedding $j: V\rightarrow M$ such that $j(\kappa)=\omega_1^{V[g*h]}$ and
$L(\Gamma^\infty, \mathbb{R})$ as computed in $V[g*h]$ is a derived model of
$M$ at $j(\kappa)$.
  As a corollary we obtain that $\mathsf{Sealing}$ holds in $V[g]$, which was
previously demonstrated by Woodin using the stationary tower forcing. Also,
using a theorem of Woodin, we conclude that the derived model of $V$ at
$\kappa$ satisfies $\mathsf{AD}_{\mathbb{R}}+``\Theta$ is a regular cardinal"".
  Inspired by core model induction, we introduce the definable powerset
$\mathcal{A}^\infty$ of $\Gamma^\infty$ and use our derived model
representation mentioned above to show that the theory of
$L(\mathcal{A}^\infty)$ cannot be changed by forcing. Working in a different
direction, we also show that the theory of $L(\Gamma^\infty,
\mathbb{R})[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathcal{C}$ is the club filter on
$\wp_{\omega_1}(\Gamma^\infty)$, cannot be changed by forcing. Proving the two
aforementioned results is the first step towards showing that the theory of

$\mu_\alpha$ is the club filter on $\wp_{\omega_1}(\alpha)$, cannot be changed

increase in fertilized maize and a 20.3-39.3 % increase in the leaf length.
There was a 38.8-66 % increase in root length and a 23.9-36.5 % increase in
plant weight in fertilized maize. The nutritive component was 59.80 mg/Kg,
655.56 mg/Kg, 103.87 mg/Kg, and 426.60 mg/Kg respectively. For a period of 21
days of active growth, the growth rate of maize primed with organic fertilizer
was 0.93 cm/day with a total yield of 100 % while the control was 0.68 cm/day
with a total yield of 50 %. A dried biofertilizer that can improve plant
growth, weight, and percentage yield without having to deal with smelly manure
looks promising and seems to be a better alternative to explore in agriculture.

multimedia contents (e.g. mismatched images and captions) to deceive the public

difficulty of not only detection but also clarification, because every

de-contextualization detection that simultaneously identifies the mismatched
pairs and the cross-modal contradictions, which is helpful for fact-check

disassembles the text-modality information to a set of fact queries based on
the Abstract Meaning Representation of the caption and then forwards the
query-image pairs into a pre-trained large vision-language model select the
``evidences"" that are helpful for us to detect misinformation. Extensive
experiments indicate that the proposed methodology can provide us with much
more interpretable predictions while maintaining the accuracy same as the

reasoning, applied today across many scientific domains. Here we present this
framework in the language of string diagrams, interpreted formally using
category theory. A class of string diagrams, called network diagrams, are in
1-to-1 correspondence with directed acyclic graphs. A causal model is given by
such a diagram with its components interpreted as stochastic maps, functions,
or general channels in a symmetric monoidal category with a 'copy-discard'
structure (cd-category), turning a model into a single mathematical object that
can be reasoned with intuitively and yet rigorously. Building on prior works by
Fong and Jacobs, Kissinger and Zanasi, as well as Fritz and Klingler, we
present diagrammatic definitions of causal models and functional causal models
in a cd-category, generalising causal Bayesian networks and structural causal
models, respectively. We formalise general interventions on a model, including
but beyond do-interventions, and present the natural notion of an open causal
model with inputs. We also give an approach to conditioning based on a
normalisation box, allowing for causal inference calculations to be done fully
diagrammatically. We define counterfactuals in this setup, and treat the
problems of the identifiability of causal effects and counterfactuals fully
diagrammatically. The benefits of such a presentation of causal models lie in
foundational questions in causal reasoning and in their clarificatory role and
pedagogical value. This work aims to be accessible to different communities,
from causal model practitioners to researchers in applied category theory, and
discusses many examples from the literature for illustration. Overall, we argue

is most naturally and intuitively done as diagrammatic reasoning.

generalized Riemann-Thomae (gRT) function and the corresponding generalized

universal behavior. In 1D we study the Anderson-like probe hopping in a weakly
disordered lattice, recognize the origin of the gRT function in the spectral
density of the probe and formulate specific RG procedure which gets mapped onto
the discrete flow in the fundamental domain of the modular group $SL(2,Z)$. In
2D we consider the generalization of the phyllotaxis crystal model proposed by
L. Levitov and suggest the explicit form of the effective potential for the
probe particle propagating in the symmetric and asymmetric 2D lattice of

show that the RG-like dynamics in the fundamental domain of $SL(2,Z)$ for

$t_{\text{f}}=t_{\text{i}}+\tau $, study unitarity and renormalizability, and
show how to include purely virtual particles, by rendering some physical
particles (and all the ghosts, if present) purely virtual. The details about
the restriction to finite $\tau $ and compact $\Omega $ are moved away from the
internal sectors of the diagrams (apart from the discretization of the
three-momenta), and coded into external sources. So doing, the diagrams are as
similar as possible to the usual $S$ matrix diagrams, and most known theorems
extend straightforwardly. Unitarity is studied by means of the spectral optical
identities, and the diagrammatic version of the identity
$U^{\dag}(t_{\text{f}},t_{\text{i}})U(t_{\text{f}},t_{\text{i}})=1$. The
dimensional regularization is extended to finite $\tau $ and compact $\Omega$,
and used to prove, under general assumptions, that renormalizability holds
whenever it holds at $\tau =\infty $, $\Omega =\mathbb{R}^{3}$. Purely virtual
particles are introduced by removing the on-shell contributions of some
physical particles, and the ghosts, from the core diagrams, and trivializing
their initial and final conditions. The resulting evolution operator
$U_{\text{ph}}(t_{\text{f}},t_{\text{i}})$ is unitary, but does not satisfy the
more general identity
$U_{\text{ph}}(t_{3},t_{2})U_{\text{ph}}(t_{2},t_{1})=U_{\text{ph}}(t_{3},t_{1})$.

finite $\tau $ on the problem of unstable particles vs resonances, and show
that the muon observation emerges from the right physical process, differently

driven by heating from below, due to a hotter core, as well as heating from
within, due to radiogenic heating and secular cooling. Thus, in order to model
the thermal evolution of terrestrial planets, we require the parameterization
of heat flux for mixed heated convection in particular. However, deriving such
a parameterization from basic principles is an elusive task. While scaling laws
for purely internal heating and purely basal heating have been successfully
determined using the idea that thermal boundary layers are marginally stable,
recent theoretical analyses have questioned the applicability of this idea to
convection in the mixed heating mode. Here, we present a scaling approach that
is rooted in the physics of convection, including the boundary layer stability
criterion. We show that, as long as interactions between thermal boundary
layers are properly accounted for, this criterion succeeds in describing
relationships between thermal boundary layer properties for mixed heated
convection. The surface heat flux of a convecting fluid is locally determined
by the properties of the upper thermal boundary layer, as opposed to globally
determined. Our foundational scaling approach can be readily extended to nearly
any complexity of convection within planetary mantles.

Ultracold atomic gases offer an ideal platform to experimentally investigate
Bose-Fermi mixtures, as the species concentration and interaction strengths can
be freely tuned. Here, we study the collective oscillations of a spin-polarized
Fermi gas immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) as a function of the
boson-fermion interaction strength and temperature. Remarkably, for strong
interspecies interactions the fermionic collective excitations evolve to
perfectly mimic the bosonic superfluid collective modes, and fermion flow
becomes dissipationless. With increasing number of thermal excitations in the
Bose gas, the fermions' dynamics exhibit a crossover from the collisionless to
the hydrodynamic regime, reminiscent of the emergence of hydrodynamics in
two-dimensional electron fluids. Our findings open the door towards
understanding non-equilibrium dynamics of strongly interacting Bose-Fermi
mixtures.

one round of minimal self-training. Next, we perform linguistic analyses of
these essays, which show that machines produce sentences with more complex
syntactic structures while human essays tend to be lexically more complex.

the lack of explicit labels in healthcare. However, conventional approaches

CMR provides a comprehensive visualization of cardiac anatomy, physiology, and
microstructure, making it challenging to interpret. Additionally, CMR reports
require synthesizing information from sequences of images and different views,
resulting in potentially weak alignment between the study and diagnosis report
pair. To overcome these challenges, we propose \textbf{CMRformer}, a multimodal
learning framework to jointly learn sequences of CMR images and associated
cardiologist's reports. Moreover, one of the major obstacles to improving CMR
study is the lack of large, publicly available datasets. To bridge this gap, we
collected a large \textbf{CMR dataset}, which consists of 13,787 studies from
clinical cases. By utilizing our proposed CMRformer and our collected dataset,
we achieved remarkable performance in real-world clinical tasks, such as CMR
image retrieval and diagnosis report retrieval. Furthermore, the learned

applications, such as disease classification. Our work could potentially
expedite progress in the CMR study and lead to more accurate and effective

fitting is a long-standing problem, and has finally been addressed in recent
years by Fefferman et al. (2020, 2021a). We develop a method with a theory
guarantee that fits a $d$-dimensional underlying manifold from noisy

true $d$-dimensional smooth manifolds whose estimation error, as measured by

information structures. On relaxed controls, two studied topologies are the
Young and Borkar (weak$^*$) topologies on spaces of functions from a

establish implication and equivalence conditions between the Young and Borkar
topologies on control policies. We then show that, under some conditions, for a
controlled Markov chain with standard Borel spaces the invariant measure is
weakly continuous on the space of stationary control policies defined by either

  Different kinds of formal languages represent different kinds of
long-distance dependencies, and correctly identifying long-distance
dependencies in sequences is a known challenge for ML systems to generalize
successfully. MLRegTest organizes its languages according to their logical
complexity (monadic second order, first order, propositional, or monomial
expressions) and the kind of logical literals (string, tier-string,
subsequence, or combinations thereof). The logical complexity and choice of
literal provides a systematic way to understand different kinds of
long-distance dependencies in regular languages, and therefore to understand
the capacities of different ML systems to learn such long-distance

  Finally, the performance of different neural networks (simple RNN, LSTM, GRU,

Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), where the entire 150 MHz can be used for free

are no guard bands between GAA and C-band, and both systems employ Time
Division Duplexing (TDD) where the uplink/downlink configurations are not
synchronized, adjacent channel interference can potentially reduce the
performance of both systems. In this paper, we quantify the effect of this

observe significant downlink throughput reductions on both systems when two

  for Massive MIMO Systems with One-Bit ADCs","submitted for IEEE journal publication",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we propose a learning-based detection framework for uplink
massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems with one-bit
analog-to-digital converters. The learning-based detection only requires
counting the occurrences of the quantized outputs of -1 and +1 for estimating a
likelihood probability at each antenna. Accordingly, the key advantage of this
approach is to perform maximum likelihood detection without explicit channel
estimation which has been one of the primary challenges of one-bit quantized
systems. The learning in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, however,
needs excessive training to estimate the extremely small likelihood
probabilities. To address this drawback, we propose a dither-and-learning
technique to estimate likelihood functions from dithered signals. First, we add
a dithering signal to artificially decrease the SNR and then infer the
likelihood function from the quantized dithered signals by using an SNR
estimate derived from a deep neural network-based offline estimator. We extend
our technique by developing an adaptive dither-and-learning method that updates
the dithering power according the patterns observed in the quantized dithered
signals. The proposed framework is also applied to state-of-the-art
channel-coded MIMO systems by computing a bit-wise and user-wise log-likelihood
ratio from the refined likelihood probabilities. Simulation results validate
the detection performance of the proposed methods in both uncoded and coded
systems.

the shape of the initialprofile influences the evolution of the enstrophy $Z$,
helicity ${\cal H}$ and dissipation-scale. Significant differences develop even
when all have the same three-fold symmetric trajectory, the same initial
circulation and the same range of the viscosities $\nu$. Maps of the helicity
density $h=u\cdot\omega$ onto vorticity isosurfaces patches show where
$h\lesssim0$ sheets form during reconnection. For the Gaussian/Lamb-Oseen
profile helicity ${\cal H}$ grows significantly, with only a brief spurt of
enstrophy growth as thin braids form then decay during reconnection. The
remaining profiles are algebraic. For the untruncated algebraic cases,$h<0$
vortex sheets form in tandem with $\nu$-independent convergence of
$\sqrt{\nu}Z(t)$ at a common $t_x$. For those with the broadest wings,
enstrophy growth accelerates during reconnection, leading to approximately
$\nu$-independent convergent finite-time dissipation rates $\epsilon=\nu Z$. By
mapping terms from the budget equations onto centerlines, the origins of the
divergent behavior are illustrated. Lamb-Oseen has six locations of centerline
convergence form with local negative helicity dissipation, $\epsilon_h<0$, and
small, but positive $h$. Later, the sum of these localized patches of
$\epsilon_h<0$ leads to a positive increase in the global ${\cal H}$ and
suppression of enstrophy production. For the algebraic profiles: There are only
three locations of centerline convergence, each with spans of less localized
$\epsilon_h<0$ and some $h<0$. Spans that could be the seeds for the $h<0$
vortex sheets that form in the lower half of the trefoil as the
$\sqrt{\nu}Z(t)$ phase begins and can explain accelerated growth of the
enstrophy and evidence for finite-time energy dissipation $\Delta E_\epsilon$.

has developed rapidly, and many methods have been proposed to enhance the
expressiveness. However, most methods do not have a uniform expressiveness
measure except for a few that strictly follow the $k$-dimensional
Weisfeiler-Lehman ($k$-WL) test hierarchy. Their theoretical analyses are often
limited to distinguishing certain families of non-isomorphic graphs, leading to
difficulties in quantitatively comparing their expressiveness. In contrast to
theoretical analysis, another way to measure expressiveness is by evaluating
model performance on certain datasets containing 1-WL-indistinguishable graphs.
Previous datasets specifically designed for this purpose, however, face
problems with difficulty (any model surpassing 1-WL has nearly 100% accuracy),
granularity (models tend to be either 100% correct or near random guess), and
scale (only a few essentially different graphs in each dataset). To address
these limitations, we propose a new expressiveness dataset, $\textbf{BREC}$,
which includes 400 pairs of non-isomorphic graphs carefully selected from four
primary categories (Basic, Regular, Extension, and CFI). These graphs have
higher difficulty (up to 4-WL-indistinguishable), finer granularity (able to
compare models between 1-WL and 3-WL), and a larger scale (400 pairs). Further,
we synthetically test 16 models with higher-than-1-WL expressiveness on our
BREC dataset. Our experiment gives the first thorough comparison of the
expressiveness of those state-of-the-art beyond-1-WL GNN models. We expect this
dataset to serve as a benchmark for testing the expressiveness of future GNNs.

allows the model to learn more diverse representations, which can prevent the
model from being biased towards learning task-specific features. When learning
new tasks, it will reduce the change of feature space and improve model
generalization. On the other hand, we employ mixed feature to replace the new
features since only using new feature to optimize the model will affect the
representation that was previously embedded in the feature space. Instead, by
mixing new and old features, old knowledge can be retained without increasing
the computational complexity. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks

come to a complete halt, providing a universal mechanism for {dynamical
localization}. In the one-dimensional Hermitian Anderson model with
uncorrelated diagonal disorder, there is a one-to-one correspondence between
dynamical localization and spectral localization, i.e. the exponential
localization of all the Hamiltonian eigenfunctions. This correspondence can be
broken when dealing with disordered dissipative lattices. Recently, it has been
shown that when the system exchanges particles with the surrounding environment
and random fluctuations of the dissipation are introduced, spectral
localization is observed but without dynamical localization. Such previous
studies considered lattices with mixed conservative (Hamiltonian) and
dissipative dynamics, and were restricted to a semiclassical analysis. However,
Anderson localization in purely dissipative lattices, displaying an entirely
Lindbladian dynamics, remains largely unexplored. Here we consider the
purely-dissipative Anderson model in the framework of a Lindblad master
equation and show that, akin to the semiclassical models with conservative
hopping and random dissipation, one observes dynamical delocalization in spite
of strong spectral localization of all eigenstates of the Liouvillian
superoperator. This result is very distinct than delocalization observed in the
Anderson model with dephasing effects, where dynamical delocalization arises
from the delocalization of the stationary state of the Liouvillian
superoperator.

solution of corner states can be directly constructed, which possesses a
unified and elegant form. Based on the corner states solution and chiral
symmetries analysis, we develop a general boundary projection method to extract
the boundary Hamiltonians, which thoroughly reveals the boundary-localized

($T_\mathrm{eff} \sim 30,000-52,000$~K) all the way to K-M ($\gtrsim$3,500~K).
The physics throughout these stellar regimes varies significantly, which has
previously prohibited any detailed comparisons between stars of significantly
different type. In the final data release (internal data release 6) of the

Airy-like hyperbolic phonon polaritons (PhPs) in high-symmetry orthorhombic vdW

such Airy-like PhPs also exhibit self-accelerating, nonspreading and
self-healing characteristics. Interestingly, the helical phase gradient of
vortex beam leads to asymmetry excitation of polaritons, as a result, the
Airy-like PhPs possess asymmetric propagation feature even with a symmetric
mode, analogous to the asymmetry hyperbolic shear polaritons in low-symmetry
crystals. Our finding highlights the potential of OAM to manipulate polaritons
in vdW materials, which could be further extended into a variety of
applications such as active structured polaritonic devices.

$f^{Gas}$ and small time scale for growth of gravitational instabilities than
irregular galaxies. We find that the gravitational instabilities in spirals
convert a large fraction of gas into stars quickly, depleting the gas
reservoirs. On the other hand, star formation occurs more gradually over longer
timescales in irregulars with a higher gas fraction. We then compare the
stability of the nearby galaxies with galaxies at $z\,=\,4.5$. We find that net
stability levels in the nearby galaxies and the galaxies at $z\,=\,4.5$ are
primarily driven by the stellar disc suggesting the presence of an inherent
mechanism that self-regulates the stability. Finally, upon removing the
contribution of the dark matter to the total potential, the median $Q_{RW}$ for
the nearby galaxies and galaxies at $z \,= \,4.5$ remains unchanged indicating
that the baryons can self-regulate the stability levels, at least in a
statistical sense.

Equal-mass flybys are extremely rare and almost exclusively distant, while
frequent flybys have mass ratios 0.1 or lower, with a secondary galaxy
penetrating deep into the primary. This can result in comparable strengths of
interaction S between the two classes of flybys and lead to essentially the
same effects. To demonstrate this, emphasize and explore the role of the impact
parameter $b$, we performed a series of N-body simulations of flybys with
varying relative $b$ ranging from 0.114 to 0.272 of the virial radius of the
primary. Two-armed spirals form during flybys, with radii of origin correlated
with $b$ and strengths well approximated with an inverted S-curve. The impact
parameter does not affect the shape of induced spirals, and the lifetimes of a
distinguished spiral structure appear to be constant, 2 Gyr. Bars, with
strengths anti-correlated with $b$, form after the encounter is over in
simulations with interaction strengths $S\geq0.076$, but they are short-lived
except for the stronger ones with $S\geq0.129$. We showcase an occurrence of
double bar that survives for a long time in one of the simulations. Effects on
the pre-existing bar instability are diverse. There is no uniform correlation
between these effects and $b$, as they are secondary effects, happening later
in a post-flyby stage. Bulges are resilient to flybys, while dark matter halos
can significantly spin up in the amount anti-correlated with $b$. There is an
offset angle between the angular momentum vector of the dark matter halo and
that of a disc, and it correlates linearly with b. Flybys remain an important

have large inter-slice spacing, resulting in high in-plane resolution but
reduced through-plane resolution. Super-resolution techniques can reduce the
inter-slice spacing of 2D scanned MR images, facilitating the downstream visual
experience and computer-aided diagnosis. However, most existing
super-resolution methods are trained at a fixed scaling ratio, which is
inconvenient in clinical settings where MR scanning may have varying
inter-slice spacings. To solve this issue, we propose Hierarchical Feature
Conditional Diffusion (HiFi-Diff)} for arbitrary reduction of MR inter-slice
spacing. Given two adjacent MR slices and the relative positional offset,
HiFi-Diff can iteratively convert a Gaussian noise map into any desired
in-between MR slice. Furthermore, to enable fine-grained conditioning, the
Hierarchical Feature Extraction (HiFE) module is proposed to hierarchically
extract conditional features and conduct element-wise modulation. Our
experimental results on the publicly available HCP-1200 dataset demonstrate the
high-fidelity super-resolution capability of HiFi-Diff and its efficacy in
enhancing downstream segmentation performance.

the ``Heisenberg cut''. Following an article by John von Neumann on infinite
tensor products, this can be done by noticing that the usual formalism of
quantum mechanics, associated with unitary equivalence of representations,
stops working when countable infinities of particles (or degrees of freedom)
are encountered. This is because the dimension of the corresponding Hilbert
space becomes uncountably infinite, leading to the loss of unitary equivalence,

unified mathematical model including both quantum and classical physics, that
appear as required incommensurable facets in the description of nature.

manipulate the propagation of sound wave. Acoustic metamaterials provide a

studies are mainly concentrated in air, and the huge impedance difference makes
it difficult to directly extend these airborne structures to underwater
application. Here, we propose a metafluid to realize independent manipulation
of the mass density and bulk modulus underwater. The metafluid is composed of
hollow regular polygons immersed in the water. By adjusting the side number of
the hollow regular polygons and choosing proper materials, the effective mass
density and bulk modulus of the metafluid could be modulated independently.
Based on the flexible adjustment method, metafluids with same impedance but
different sound velocities are designed and used to realize an underwater
impedance-matched gradient index lens. In addition, by combining the proposed
metafluid with other artificial structures, acoustic parameters with great
anisotropy can be achieved, which is exemplified by the design and
demonstration of an impedance-matched underwater acoustic carpet cloak. This
work can expand the practicability of underwater metamaterials and pave the way
for future potential engineering applications in the practical underwater

MisRoB{\AE}RTa, a novel transformer-based deep neural ensemble architecture for
misinformation detection. MisRoB{\AE}RTa takes advantage of two transformers

benchmarked and evaluated the performances of multiple transformers on the task

real-world news articles dataset labeled with 10 classes, addressing two
shortcomings in the current research: increasing the size of the dataset from
small to large, and moving the focus of fake news detection from binary
classification to multi-class classification. For this dataset, we manually
verified the content of the news articles to ensure that they were correctly
labeled. The experimental results show that the accuracy of transformers on the
misinformation detection problem was significantly influenced by the method
employed to learn the context, dataset size, and vocabulary dimension. We
observe empirically that the best accuracy performance among the classification

challenge of sparse and noisy recommendation data. Although having achieved
promising results, most existing CL methods only perform either hand-crafted

augmentation operation for different datasets, which makes the model hard to
generalize. Additionally, since insufficient input data may lead the encoder to
learn collapsed embeddings, these CL methods expect a relatively large number
of training data (e.g., large batch size or memory bank) to contrast. However,
not all contrastive pairs are always informative and discriminative enough for
the training processing. Therefore, a more general CL-based recommendation
model called Meta-optimized Contrastive Learning for sequential Recommendation
(MCLRec) is proposed in this work. By applying both data augmentation and
learnable model augmentation operations, this work innovates the standard CL
framework by contrasting data and model augmented views for adaptively
capturing the informative features hidden in stochastic data augmentation.
Moreover, MCLRec utilizes a meta-learning manner to guide the updating of the
model augmenters, which helps to improve the quality of contrastive pairs
without enlarging the amount of input data. Finally, a contrastive
regularization term is considered to encourage the augmentation model to
generate more informative augmented views and avoid too similar contrastive
pairs within the meta updating. The experimental results on commonly used
datasets validate the effectiveness of MCLRec.

exploration. To that extent, detecting, mapping and counting craters is a
mainstream process in planetary science, done primarily manually, which is a
very laborious and time-consuming process. Recently, machine learning (ML) and
computer vision have been successfully applied for both detecting craters and
estimating their size. Existing ML approaches for automated crater detection
have been trained in specific types of data e.g. digital elevation model (DEM),
images and associated metadata for orbiters such as the Lunar Reconnaissance
Orbiter Camera (LROC) etc.. Due to that, each of the resulting ML schemes is
applicable and reliable only to the type of data used during the training
process. Data from different sources, angles and setups can compromise the
reliability of these ML schemes. In this paper we present a universal crater
detection scheme that is based on the recently proposed Segment Anything Model
(SAM) from META AI. SAM is a prompt-able segmentation system with zero-shot
generalization to unfamiliar objects and images without the need for additional
training. Using SAM we can successfully identify crater-looking objects in any
type of data (e,g, raw satellite images Level-1 and 2 products, DEMs etc.) for
different setups (e.g. Lunar, Mars) and different capturing angles. Moreover,
using shape indexes, we only keep the segmentation masks of crater-like
features. These masks are subsequently fitted with an ellipse, recovering both
the location and the size/geometry of the detected craters.

different modalities, enriching the representation of the target unimodal one.
Recent studies highly relate the temporal synchronization between vision and
sound to the semantic consistency for cross-modal distillation. However, such
semantic consistency from the synchronization is hard to guarantee in
unconstrained videos, due to the irrelevant modality noise and differentiated
semantic correlation. To this end, we first propose a \textit{Modality Noise
Filter} (MNF) module to erase the irrelevant noise in teacher modality with
cross-modal context. After this purification, we then design a
\textit{Contrastive Semantic Calibration} (CSC) module to adaptively distill
useful knowledge for target modality, by referring to the differentiated
sample-wise semantic correlation in a contrastive fashion. Extensive
experiments show that our method could bring a performance boost compared with
other distillation methods in both visual action recognition and video
retrieval task. We also extend to the audio tagging task to prove the
generalization of our method. The source code is available at

potentials for weakly bound diatomic molecules using Morse function. In this
work, our goal is to construct inverse potentials for all available l-channels
of np-scattering using RPA. The Riccati-type phase equations for various
l-channels are solved using 5th order Runge-Kutta method to obtain scattering
phase shifts (SPS) in tandem with an optimization procedure to minimize mean
squared error (MSE). Interaction potentials for a total of 18 states have been
constructed using only three parameter Morse interaction model. The obtained
MSE is < 1% for 1S0 , 3P1 and 3D1 channels and < 2% for 1P1 channel and < 0.1%
for rest of the 14 channels. The obtained total scattering cross-sections at
various lab energies are found to be matching well with experimental ones. This
phase wave analysis study of all channels of np-scattering using RPA has been
undertaken using Morse function as zeroth reference, by us, is for the first
time.

social media, personalized social media is becoming the new norm. Although the
digitalization progress of the media brings many advantages, it also increases
the risk of spreading disinformation, misinformation, and malformation through
the use of fake news. The emergence of this harmful phenomenon has managed to
polarize society and manipulate public opinion on particular topics, e.g.,
elections, vaccinations, etc. Such information propagated on social media can
distort public perceptions and generate social unrest while lacking the rigor
of traditional journalism. Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning
techniques are essential for developing efficient tools that can detect fake

the fake news detection problem, as they manage to encode linguistic features
within the vector representation of words. In this paper, we propose a new
approach that uses document embeddings to build multiple models that accurately
label news articles as reliable or fake. We also present a benchmark on
different architectures that detect fake news using binary or multi-labeled
classification. We evaluated the models on five large news corpora using
accuracy, precision, and recall. We obtained better results than more complex

case of the 2D Euler equations. Moreover we consider the group of

stellar surveys. We developed an automated search for coherent projections on
the sky of clouds isolated in 3D extinction density maps on the one hand, and
regions responsible for CO radio emissions at specific Doppler shifts on the
other hand. The discrete dust structures were obtained by application of the
Fellwalker algorithm to a recent 3D extinction density map. For each extinction
cloud, a technique using a narrow sliding spectral window moved along the
contour-bounded CO spectrum and geometrical criteria was used to select the
most likely velocity interval. We applied the new contour-based technique to
the 3D extinction density distribution within the volume encompassing the
Taurus, Auriga, Perseus and California molecular complexes. From the 45 clouds
issued from the decomposition, 42 were assigned a velocity. The remaining
structures correspond to very weak CO emission or extinction. We used the
non-automated assignments of radial velocities to clouds of the same region
presented in paper I and based on KI absorption spectra as a validation test.
The new fully automated determinations were found in good agreement with these
previous measurements. Our results show that an automated search based on cloud
contour morphology can be efficient and that this novel technique may be
extended to wider regions of the Milky Way and at larger distance. We discuss
its limitations and potential improvements after combination with other

inflammatory condition of the esophagus associated with elevated esophageal
eosinophils. EoE is a top cause of chronic dysphagia after GERD. Diagnosis of
EoE relies on counting eosinophils in histological slides, a manual and
time-consuming task that limits the ability to extract complex
patient-dependent features. The treatment of EoE includes medication and food
elimination. A personalized food elimination plan is crucial for engagement and
efficiency, but previous attempts failed to produce significant results. In
this work, on the one hand, we utilize AI for inferring histological features
from the entire biopsy slide, features that cannot be extracted manually. On
the other hand, we develop causal learning models that can process this wealth
of data. We applied our approach to the 'Six-Food vs. One-Food Eosinophilic
Esophagitis Diet Study', where 112 symptomatic adults aged 18-60 years with
active EoE were assigned to either a six-food elimination diet (6FED) or a
one-food elimination diet (1FED) for six weeks. Our results show that the
average treatment effect (ATE) of the 6FED treatment compared with the 1FED
treatment is not significant, that is, neither diet was superior to the other.
We examined several causal models and show that the best treatment strategy was
obtained using T-learner with two XGBoost modules. While 1FED only and 6FED
only provide improvement for 35%-38% of the patients, which is not
significantly different from a random treatment assignment, our causal model
yields a significantly better improvement rate of 58.4%. This study illustrates
the significance of AI in enhancing treatment planning by analyzing molecular
features' distribution in histological slides through causal learning. Our
approach can be harnessed for other conditions that rely on histology for
diagnosis and treatment.

shapes the evolution of sub-Jovian exoplanets, particularly those with short
orbital periods. The metastable He line in the near-infrared at $1.083$ $\mu$m
is a reliable tracer of atmospheric escape in hot exoplanets, with the
advantage of being observable from the ground. However, observing escaping He
in sub-Jovian planets has remained challenging due to the systematic effects
and telluric contamination present in ground-based data. With the successful
launch and operations of JWST, we now have access to extremely stable
high-precision near-infrared spectrographs in space. Here we predict the
observability of metastable He with JWST in two representative and previously
well-studied warm Neptunes, GJ 436 b ($T_{\rm eq} = 687~{\rm K}$, $R_{\rm p} =
0.37~{\rm R_J}$) and GJ 1214 b ($T_{\rm eq} = 588~{\rm K}$, $R_{\rm p} =
0.25~{\rm R_J}$). Our simulated JWST observations for GJ 436 b demonstrate that
a single transit with NIRSpec/G140H is sensitive to mass loss rates that are
two orders of magnitude lower than what is detectable from the ground. Our
exercise for GJ 1214 b show that the best configuration to observe the
relatively weak outflows of warm Neptunes with JWST is with NIRSpec/G140H, and
that NIRSpec/G140M and NIRISS/SOSS are less optimal. Since none of these
instrument configurations can spectrally resolve the planetary absorption, we
conclude that the 1D isothermal Parker-wind approximation may not be sufficient
for interpreting such observations. More sophisticated models are critical for
breaking the degeneracy between outflow temperature and mass-loss rate for JWST
measurements of metastable He.

i.e., (a)we derive a model governing the multi-component flows in thermal
disequilibrium with transport terms, (b)we use the derived model to study the
Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability in thermally relaxing multi-component systems.
The model is reduced from the fully disequilibrium multi-phase Baer-Nunziato
model in the limit of small Knudsen number $Kn << 1$. Velocity disequilibrium
is closed with the diffusion laws and only one mass weighted velocity is
retained formally. Thus, the complex wave structure of the original
Baer-Nunziato model is simplified to a large extent and the obtained model is
much more computationally affordable. Moreover, the capability to deal with
finite temperature relaxation is kept. Efficient numerical methods for solving
the proposed model are aslo presented. Equipped with the proposed model and
numerical methods, we further investigate the impact of the thermal relaxation
on the RT instability development at the inertial confinement fusion (ICF)
deceleration stage. On the basis of numerical simulations, we have found that
for the RT instability at an interface between the high-density low-temperature
component and the low-density high-temperature component, the thermal

installation of DG is often limited by technical constraints of the network,
standards, and national grid codes. As a method for removing the mentioned
obstacles, the potential of dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs) is recently
becoming recognized as a way for maximizing the benefits of installing DG. In
this paper, we present an improvement of the already developed models that
often neglect voltage unbalance constraints or are not based on an optimization
approach. To test the model, two realistic case studies are defined. The
results show that not all technical constraints are equally important, that the
voltage unbalance constraint impacts the calculated DOEs for single-phase
installed DG units, and that neglecting the temporal and spatial component in
determining the limitation power is inadequate.

maximum mean value of the residual eccentricity of about 0.026 immediately
before the engulfment. Considering an Earth-mass planet with an initial orbital
semimajor axis sufficiently large to escape engulfment, we find that the mean
value of the residual eccentricity is greater than 0.01 for an initial
separation up to about 1.4 au. The engulfment of the Earth by the red giant Sun

assumed in previous studies. If an Earth-like planet escapes engulfment, its
orbit around its remnant white dwarf star will be moderately eccentric. Such a
residual eccentricity on the order of a few hundredths can play a relevant role
in sustaining the pollution of the white dwarf atmosphere by asteroids and
comets as observed in several objects.

revolutions from the beginning of the twentieth century, quantum mechanics (via
deformation quantization) and special relativity. On the basis of these facts
we describe two main directions by which symmetries of hadrons (strongly

describe photonic continuous media (PCM) traditionally as either transparency

characterize PCM as either trivial or nontrivial, by using topological
invariant which are not direct to EM parameters. As all of optical properties
in PCM should be related to EM parameters, we formulate a topological index
based on EM parameters and establish its phase map in this work. The map can
analytically describe the deterministic condition for a topologically
nontrivial phase. Our findings indicate that the topology of 2D bi-anisotropic
PCM is determined by the sign of the topological index. Another EM parameter of
pseudo surface impedance is also introduced for the opaque regions of PCM,
showing that the topological opacity has a full range of impedance values
ranging from negative to positive, while the trivial case only has either
negative or positive impedance. The simulation results show that an interface
between two opacities with differing index signs can support robustly optical
propagation of topological edge states. As the index only depends on EM
parameters, it will pave an insightful way to further understand the intrinsic
properties of photonic topology.

  Half-Quadratic Splitting Networks with Anderson Acceleration","27 pages, 8figures, 6 algorithms",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is widely applied in medical diagnosis,
industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Combining the physical
principles of the imaging system with the advantages of data-driven deep
learning networks, physics-embedded deep unrolling networks have recently
emerged as a promising solution in computational imaging. However, the inherent
nonlinear and ill-posed properties of EIT image reconstruction still present
challenges to existing methods in terms of accuracy and stability. To tackle
this challenge, we propose the learned half-quadratic splitting (HQSNet)
algorithm for incorporating physics into learning-based EIT imaging. We then
apply Anderson acceleration (AA) to the HQSNet algorithm, denoted as AA-HQSNet,
which can be interpreted as AA applied to the Gauss-Newton step and the learned
proximal gradient descent step of the HQSNet, respectively. AA is a widely-used
technique for accelerating the convergence of fixed-point iterative algorithms
and has gained significant interest in numerical optimization and machine
learning. However, the technique has received little attention in the inverse
problems community thus far. Employing AA enhances the convergence rate
compared to the standard HQSNet while simultaneously avoiding artifacts in the
reconstructions. Lastly, we conduct rigorous numerical and visual experiments
to show that the AA module strengthens the HQSNet, leading to robust, accurate,
and considerably superior reconstructions compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Our Anderson acceleration scheme to enhance HQSNet is generic and can be
applied to improve the performance of various physics-embedded deep learning
methods.

FlexEdge acts as a flying server. In particular, we first formulate an energy
consumption minimization problem by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory and
computation resource under the practical constraints. To address such a
challenging problem, we then build the computation offloading process as a
Markov decision process and propose a deep reinforcement learning-based
proximal policy optimization algorithm to dynamically learn the computation
offloading strategy and trajectory design policy. Numerical results indicate
that our proposed algorithm can achieve quick convergence rate and
significantly reduce the system energy consumption.

will receive. However, most commonly used models may underestimate the
influence of newly published papers over time, and fail to encapsulate this
dynamics of citation network into the graph. In this study, we construct
hierarchical and heterogeneous graphs for target papers with an annual
perspective. The constructed graphs can record the annual dynamics of target
papers' scientific context information. Then, a novel graph neural network,
Hierarchical and Heterogeneous Contrastive Graph Learning Model (H2CGL), is
proposed to incorporate heterogeneity and dynamics of the citation network.
H2CGL separately aggregates the heterogeneous information for each year and
prioritizes the highly-cited papers and relationships among references,
citations, and the target paper. It then employs a weighted GIN to capture
dynamics between heterogeneous subgraphs over years. Moreover, it leverages
contrastive learning to make the graph representations more sensitive to
potential citations. Particularly, co-cited or co-citing papers of the target
paper with large citation gap are taken as hard negative samples, while
randomly dropping low-cited papers could generate positive samples. Extensive
experimental results on two scholarly datasets demonstrate that the proposed
H2CGL significantly outperforms a series of baseline approaches for both
previously and freshly published papers. Additional analyses highlight the
significance of the proposed modules. Our codes and settings have been released

  Complex Phenomena in Heterogeneous Media","79 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.CE physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Rapid evolution of sensor technology, advances in instrumentation, and
progress in devising data-acquisition softwares/hardwares are providing vast
amounts of data for various complex phenomena, ranging from those in
atomospheric environment, to large-scale porous formations, and biological
systems. The tremendous increase in the speed of scientific computing has also
made it possible to emulate diverse high-dimensional, multiscale and
multiphysics phenomena that contain elements of stochasticity, and to generate
large volumes of numerical data for them in heterogeneous systems. The
difficulty is, however, that often the governing equations for such phenomena
are not known. A prime example is flow, transport, and deformation processes in
macroscopically-heterogeneous materials and geomedia. In other cases, the
governing equations are only partially known, in the sense that they either
contain various coefficients that must be evaluated based on data, or that they
require constitutive relations, such as the relationship between the stress
tensor and the velocity gradients for non-Newtonian fluids in the momentum
conservation equation, in order for them to be useful to the modeling. Several
classes of approaches are emerging to address such problems that are based on
machine learning, symbolic regression, the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator
formulation, sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics, data assimilation,
and stochastic optimization and analysis, or a combination of two or more of
such approaches. This Perspective describes the latest developments in this
highly important area, and discusses possible future directions.

privacy threats has emerged. Current studies have addressed the topic of
preserving speech privacy. One of them, the VoicePrivacy initiative aims to
promote the development of privacy preservation tools for speech technology.
The task selected for the VoicePrivacy 2020 Challenge (VPC) is about speaker
anonymization. The goal is to hide the source speaker's identity while
preserving the linguistic information. The baseline of the VPC makes use of a
voice conversion. This paper studies the impact of the speaker anonymization
baseline system of the VPC on emotional information present in speech
utterances. Evaluation is performed following the VPC rules regarding the
attackers' knowledge about the anonymization system. Our results show that the
VPC baseline system does not suppress speakers' emotions against informed
attackers. When comparing anonymized speech to original speech, the emotion
recognition performance is degraded by 15\% relative to IEMOCAP data, similar
to the degradation observed for automatic speech recognition used to evaluate
the preservation of the linguistic information.

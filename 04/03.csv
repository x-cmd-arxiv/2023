distances will undergo a so-called super-catastrophic disruption. The
mechanisms causing such disruptions are currently unknown or, at least,
undetermined. To help guide theoretical and experimental work to understand the
disruption mechanism, we use numerical simulations of a synthetic NEA
population to identify the resonant mechanisms that are responsible for driving
NEAs close to the Sun, determine how these different mechanisms relate to their
dynamical lifetimes at small heliocentric distances and calculate the average
time they spend at different heliocentric distances. Typically, resonances
between NEAs and the terrestrial and giant planets are able to dramatically
reduce the perihelion distances of the former. We developed an algorithm that
scans the orbital evolution of asteroids and automatically identifies
occurrences of mean motion and secular resonances. We find that most near-Sun
asteroids are pushed to small perihelion distances by the 3:1J and 4:1J
mean-motion resonances with Jupiter, as well as the secular resonances v6,
v5,v3 and v4. The time-scale of the small-perihelion evolution is fastest for
the 4:1J, followed by the 3:1J, while v5 is the slowest.~7% of the test
asteroids were not trapped in a resonance during the latest stages of their
dynamical evolution, which suggests that the secular oscillation of the
eccentricity due to the Kozai mechanism, a planetary close encounter or a
resonance that we have not identified pushed them below the estimated average
disruption distance.

not only by the levels of performance required, but also by complex and

key design requirement. In this paper, a new versatile transmitter is proposed
for space telemetry, capable of soft-switching across different linear and
continuous phase modulation schemes while maintaining the same hardware
structure. This permits a single HW qualification to ``cover'' diverse uses of
the same hardware, and thus avoid re-qualification in case of configuration
changes. The envisaged solution foresees the use of a single filter, suitable
not only for linear modulations such as M-QAM, but also for continuous phase
modulation methods. At this stage, we focus on pulse code modulation/frequency
modulation (PCM/FM), for which we propose a minimum mean square error (MMSE)
algorithm. The proposed algorithm, which adds to the system flexibility and
effectiveness, may use a single first filter based on Laurent decomposition for
initialization, if needed. Performances are assessed using the mean square
error (MSE) measure between the proposed MMSE-modulated signal and the
completely modulated signal. Simulation results confirm that the proposed
algorithm leads to MSE values that are lower than the case of Laurent
decomposition using the first component only.

also signalled by boundary terms, although superficially they may seem

phenomena are not strictly related: while there is a regime in which the
criteria are satisfied and the spectrum is good, there is also an intermediate
regime in which the criteria are violated, boundary terms are present, leading
to wrong convergence of CL, yet the spectrum still looks good. This shows that
the absence of boundary terms is crucial for correctness, wheres the spectrum

fast and accurate models that enable analysis of system behavior have become an
essential requirement for system development. The fast transient processes
involved in the operation of a combustion engine make it difficult to develop
accurate physics-based models for such systems. As an alternative to physics
based models, we develop an operator-based regression model (DeepONet) to learn
the relevant output states for a mean-value gas flow engine model using the
engine operating conditions as input variables. We have adopted a mean-value
model as a benchmark for comparison, simulated using Simulink. The developed
approach necessitates using the initial conditions of the output states to
predict the accurate sequence over the temporal domain. To this end, a
sequence-to-sequence approach is embedded into the proposed framework. The
accuracy of the model is evaluated by comparing the prediction output to ground
truth generated from Simulink model. The maximum $\mathcal L_2$ relative error
observed was approximately $6.5\%$. The sensitivity of the DeepONet model is
evaluated under simulated noise conditions and the model shows relatively low
sensitivity to noise. The uncertainty in model prediction is further assessed
by using a mean ensemble approach. The worst-case error at the $(\mu +
2\sigma)$ boundary was found to be $12\%$. The proposed framework provides the
ability to predict output states in real-time and enables data-driven learning
of complex input-output operator mapping. As a result, this model can be

to privacy and security concerns of patient data. Moreover, low-count PET data
at different institutions may have different data distribution, thus requiring
personalized models. While previous federated learning (FL) algorithms enable
multi-institution collaborative training without the need of aggregating local
data, addressing the large domain shift in the application of
multi-institutional low-count PET denoising remains a challenge and is still

federated learning strategy that addresses these challenges. FedFTN uses a
local deep feature transformation network (FTN) to modulate the feature outputs
of a globally shared denoising network, enabling personalized low-count PET
denoising for each institution. During the federated learning process, only the
denoising network's weights are communicated and aggregated, while the FTN
remains at the local institutions for feature transformation. We evaluated our

we propose DropMAE, which adaptively performs spatial-attention dropout in the

We show that our DropMAE is a strong and efficient temporal matching learner,
which achieves better finetuning results on matching-based tasks than the
ImageNetbased MAE with 2X faster pre-training speed. Moreover, we also find
that motion diversity in pre-training videos is more important than scene
diversity for improving the performance on VOT and VOS. Our pre-trained DropMAE
model can be directly loaded in existing ViT-based trackers for fine-tuning
without further modifications. Notably, DropMAE sets new state-of-the-art

companies and researchers attempt to deploy autonomous systems in less
constrained environments, it is increasingly important that we endow sequential
decision-making algorithms with the ability to reason about uncertainty and
risk.
  In this thesis, we will address both planning and reinforcement learning (RL)
approaches to sequential decision-making. In the planning setting, it is
assumed that a model of the environment is provided, and a policy is optimised
within that model. Reinforcement learning relies upon extensive random
exploration, and therefore usually requires a simulator in which to perform
training. In many real-world domains, it is impossible to construct a perfectly
accurate model or simulator. Therefore, the performance of any policy is
inevitably uncertain due to the incomplete knowledge about the environment.
Furthermore, in stochastic domains, the outcome of any given run is also
uncertain due to the inherent randomness of the environment. These two sources
of uncertainty are usually classified as epistemic, and aleatoric uncertainty,
respectively. The over-arching goal of this thesis is to contribute to
developing algorithms that mitigate both sources of uncertainty in sequential
decision-making problems.
  We make a number of contributions towards this goal, with a focus on

tackling important tasks such as image matching and retrieval. The core
assumption of most methods is that images undergo affine transformations,
disregarding more complicated effects such as non-rigid deformations.
Furthermore, incipient works tailored for non-rigid correspondence still rely
on keypoint detectors designed for rigid transformations, hindering performance
due to the limitations of the detector. We propose DALF (Deformation-Aware
Local Features), a novel deformation-aware network for jointly detecting and
describing keypoints, to handle the challenging problem of matching deformable
surfaces. All network components work cooperatively through a feature fusion
approach that enforces the descriptors' distinctiveness and invariance.
Experiments using real deforming objects showcase the superiority of our
method, where it delivers 8% improvement in matching scores compared to the
previous best results. Our approach also enhances the performance of two
real-world applications: deformable object retrieval and non-rigid 3D surface
registration. Code for training, inference, and applications are publicly

processes, from the ionization to the electrons' mobility. In the context of
Hall thruster's particle-in-cell (PIC) modeling, the neutrals are often treated
kinetically, similar to the plasma species, and their interactions with
themselves and the ions are resolved using the Direct-Simulation Monte-Carlo
(DSMC) algorithm. However, the DSMC approach is computationally resource
demanding. Therefore, modeling the neutrals as a 1D fluid has been also pursued
in simulations that do not involve the radial coordinate and, hence, do not
resolve the neutrals' radial expansion. In this article, we present an
extensive study on the sensitivity of the PIC simulations of Hall thruster
discharge to the model used for the neutral dynamics. We carried out 1D axial
PIC simulations with various fluid and kinetic models of the neutrals as well
as self-consistent quasi-2D axial-azimuthal simulations with different
neutrals' fluid descriptions. Our results show that the predictions of the
simulations in either 1D or 2D configurations are highly sensitive to the
neutrals' model, and that different treatments of the neutrals change the
spatiotemporal evolution of the discharge. Moreover, we observed that
considering the ion-neutral collisions causes a significant variation in the
neutral temperature, thus requiring that the neutrals' energy equation to be
included as well in their fluid system of equations. Finally, the
self-consistent axial-azimuthal simulations highlighted that a neutrals' model
based on the continuity conservation equation only is not an appropriate choice

quantizer outputs are an asymptotically stationary, ergodic process. To enable
LQG control with provably near-minimum bitrate, the quantizer outputs must be
encoded into binary codewords efficiently. This is possible given knowledge of
the probability distributions of the quantizer outputs, or of their limiting

readily admit closed form descriptions. This motivates the application of
universal source coding. Our main theoretical contribution in this work is a
proof that (after an invertible transformation), the quantizer outputs are
random variables that fall within an exponential or power-law envelope class

nature and substructure. To this end, its mass and width for the decay channel
$P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338){}^0 \rightarrow J/\psi \Lambda$ are calculated by
applying two- and three-point QCD sum rule methods, respectively. The state is
considered as a $\Xi_c\bar{D}$ meson-baryon molecular structure with
spin-parity quantum numbers $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-$. The obtained mass and width
are $m_{P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338){}^0}=4338.27\pm 129.99~\mathrm{MeV}$ and
$\Gamma(P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338){}^0 \rightarrow J/\psi
\Lambda)=\left(7.22\pm 1.78\right)~\mathrm{MeV}$, which are consistent with the
experimental data. This allows us to assign a $\Xi_c\bar{D}$ molecular
structure of $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-$ for the $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338){}^0$

(QT) claims that if we reject supplementing QT with hidden variables and
consider that unitary QT is correct and, in principle, universal, we should
adopt a relationalist approach to QT. This tradition involves a series of
approaches that relativize measurement outcomes to, for example, worlds,
systems, agents, or reference frames. It includes Everett's Relative-State
formulation of QT, the Many-worlds Interpretation, Relational Quantum
Mechanics, QBism, Healey's Pragmatism, and Diek's perspectival modal
interpretation. These approaches have potential costs connected with their
relationalism that may make them unattractive. Thus, if there is a
non-relationalist non-hidden variable universal approach to QT, it should be
taken seriously. I will present an approach of this kind called
Endeterminacy-Based Quantum Theory (EBQT). EBQT circumvents relationalism by
constructing an account of determinate and indeterminate quantum properties
that is not relational while maintaining unitary non-hidden variable universal
QT. In situations where a relationalist is pressed to assume that measurement
outcomes are relativized, such as in the extended Wigner's friend scenarios,
according to EBQT there aren't determinate outcomes but systems with certain
non-relational indeterminate properties. In this approach, systems with
determinate properties arose at some point in the past through certain
interactions, and these systems further allowed other systems to have
determinate properties. Systems keep having determinate properties over time
because of these structured interactions represented by certain networks. In
situations where there is isolation from the rest of the systems that belong to
these networks, such as inside the friend's lab, indeterminate properties
absolutely arise inside the lab.

Pudl\'ak) prove that ruling out length $t$ proofs of any unprovable sentence is
hard. This mapping from unprovable to hard-to-prove sentences powerfully
translates facts about noncomputability into complexity theory. For instance,
because proving string $x$ is Kolmogorov random ($x{\in}R$) is typically
impossible, it is typically hard to prove ""no length $t$ proof shows
$x{\in}R$"", or tautologies encoding this. Therefore, a proof system with one
family of hard tautologies has these densely in an enumeration of families. The
assumption also implies that a natural language is $\textbf{NP}$-intermediate:
with $R$ redefined to have a sparse complement, the complement of the language
$\{\langle x,1^t\rangle|$ no length $t$ proof exists of $x{\in}R\}$ is also
sparse.
  Efficiently ruling out length $t$ proofs of $x{\in}R$ might violate the
constraint on using the fact of $x{\in}R$'s unprovability. We conjecture: any
computable predicate on $R$ that might be used in if-then statements (or
case-based proofs) does no better than branching at random, because $R$ appears
random by any effective test. This constraint could also inhibit the usefulness
in circuits and propositional proofs of NOT gates and cancellation -- needed to
encode if-then statements. If $R$ defeats if-then logic, exhaustive search is
necessary.

\frac{1}{4} R_{3434}$ multiplied with $r^3$ tends to a function $P(u, \theta,

(which corresponds to the limit at spacelike infinity), this function tends to
a function $P^+ (\theta, \phi)$ on $S^2$. We prove that the latter limit does
not have any $l=1$ modes. However, it has all the other modes, $l=0, l \geq 2$.
Important derivatives of crucial curvature components do not decay in $u$,

peeling of the Weyl curvature components at future null infinity stops at the
order $r^{-3}$, that is $r^{-4} |u|^{+1}$, for large data, and at order $r^{-

eight potentially surprising such points:
  1. LLMs predictably get more capable with increasing investment, even without
targeted innovation.
  2. Many important LLM behaviors emerge unpredictably as a byproduct of
increasing investment.
  3. LLMs often appear to learn and use representations of the outside world.
  4. There are no reliable techniques for steering the behavior of LLMs.
  5. Experts are not yet able to interpret the inner workings of LLMs.
  6. Human performance on a task isn't an upper bound on LLM performance.
  7. LLMs need not express the values of their creators nor the values encoded
in web text.
  8. Brief interactions with LLMs are often misleading.

prediction concerning newly-emerged unseen entities. Recently, a new task,
i.e., TKG few-shot out-of-graph (OOG) link prediction, is proposed, where TKGC
models are required to achieve great link prediction performance concerning
newly-emerged entities that only have few-shot observed examples. In this work,
we propose a TKGC method FITCARL that combines few-shot learning with
reinforcement learning to solve this task. In FITCARL, an agent traverses
through the whole TKG to search for the prediction answer. A policy network is
designed to guide the search process based on the traversed path. To better
address the data scarcity problem in the few-shot setting, we introduce a
module that computes the confidence of each candidate action and integrate it
into the policy for action selection. We also exploit the entity concept
information with a novel concept regularizer to boost model performance.
Experimental results show that FITCARL achieves stat-of-the-art performance on

employs an encoder to project high-dimensional input information (e.g., loading

hidden space and a decoder to map the hidden representation to the stress of
interest. We evaluated various encoder architectures, including gated recurrent
unit (GRU), GRU with attention, temporal convolutional network (TCN), and the
Transformer encoder, on two complex stress-strain datasets that were designed
to include a wide range of complex loading histories and loading conditions.
All architectures achieved excellent test results with an RMSE below 1 MPa.
Additionally, we analyzed the capability of the different architectures to make
predictions on out-of-domain applications, with an uncertainty estimation based
on deep ensembles. The proposed approach provides a robust alternative to
empirical/semi-empirical models for CRs modeling, offering the potential for
more accurate and efficient materials design and optimization.

available data. We provide the first measurements of its epochs of explosion
(MJD 59529.32 $\pm$ 0.16) as well as ``first light'' (MJD 59529.85 $\pm$ 0.55)
associated with the main ejecta ${\rm{^{56}Ni}}$ distribution. This places our
first detection of SN 2021aefx at $\sim -$0.5 hours since ``first light'',
indicating the presence of additional power sources. Our peak-spectrum confirms
its Type Ia sub-classification as intermediate between Core-Normal and
Broad-Line, and we estimate the ejecta mass to be $\sim$ 1.34 $M_{\odot}$. The
pre-peak spectral evolution identifies fast-expanding material reaching $>$
40,000 km s$^{-1}$ (the fastest ever observed in Type Ia SNe) and at least two
distinct homologously-expanding ejecta components: (1) a normal-velocity
(12,400 km s$^{-1}$) component consistent with the typical photospheric
evolution of Chandrasekhar-mass ejecta; and (2) a high-velocity (23,500 km
s$^{-1}$) component visible during the first $\sim$ 3.6 days post-explosion,
which locates the component within the outer $<$ 16\% of the ejecta mass.
Asymmetric, subsonic explosion processes producing a non-spherical photosphere
provide an explanation for the simultaneous presence of the two components, as
well as the red excess emission via a slight ${\rm{^{56}Ni}}$ enrichment in the
outer $\sim$ 0.5\% of the ejecta mass. Our spectrum from 300 days post-peak
advances the constraint against non-degenerate companions and further supports
a near-Chandrasekhar-mass explosion origin. Off-center ignited
delayed-detonations of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs may be responsible for
the observed features of SN 2021aefx in some normal Type Ia SNe.

domain generalization methods typically train a representation function
followed by a classifier jointly to minimize both the classification risk and
the domain discrepancy. However, when it comes to model selection, most of
these methods rely on traditional validation routines that select models solely
based on the lowest classification risk on the validation set. In this paper,
we theoretically demonstrate a trade-off between minimizing classification risk
and mitigating domain discrepancy, i.e., it is impossible to achieve the
minimum of these two objectives simultaneously. Motivated by this theoretical
result, we propose a novel model selection method suggesting that the
validation process should account for both the classification risk and the
domain discrepancy. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by
numerical results on several domain generalization datasets.

the ziagzag antiferromagnetic order as hydrostatic pressure increases.
Furthermore, a reversible pressure-induced structural transition occurs at a

magnetic transition temperature is discussed in relation to a pressure-induced

difficulty arises from the fact that changing a variable may affect other

a deceptive landscape. In this work, we compare two approaches to a baseline
solution: a Genetic Algorithm and a CMA-ES algorithm. There are two objectives
when designing the bridges: minimizing the cost and maintaining the structural
constraints in acceptable values to be considered safe. These are conflicting
objectives, meaning that decreasing the cost often results in a bridge that is
not structurally safe. The results suggest that CMA-ES is a better option for
finding good solutions in the search space, beating the baseline with the same

resolved positively the so-called No Low-Energy Trivial State (NLTS) conjecture
by Freedman and Hastings. The conjecture postulated the existence of
linear-size local Hamiltonians on n qubit systems for which no near-ground
state can be prepared by a shallow (sublogarithmic depth) circuit. The
construction in [ABN22] is based on recently developed good quantum codes.
Earlier results in this direction included the constructions of the so-called
Combinatorial NLTS -- a weaker version of NLTS -- where a state is defined to
have low energy if it violates at most a vanishing fraction of the Hamiltonian
terms [AB22]. These constructions were also based on codes.
  In this paper we provide a ""non-code"" construction of a class of Hamiltonians
satisfying the Combinatorial NLTS. The construction is inspired by one in
[AB22], but our proof uses the complex solution space geometry of random K-SAT
instead of properties of codes. Specifically, it is known that above a certain
clause-to-variables density the set of satisfying assignments of random K-SAT
exhibits an overlap gap property, which implies that it can be partitioned into
exponentially many clusters each constituting at most an exponentially small
fraction of the total set of satisfying solutions. We establish a certain
robust version of this clustering property for the space of near-satisfying
assignments and show that for our constructed Hamiltonians every combinatorial
near-ground state induces a near-uniform distribution supported by this set.
Standard arguments then are used to show that such distributions cannot be
prepared by quantum circuits with depth o(log n). Since the clustering property
is exhibited by many random structures, including proper coloring and maximum
cut, we anticipate that our approach is extendable to these models as well.

nonlinear parabolic PDEs of the second order in a backward-forward manner,
namely one terminal and one initial conditions are prescribed respectively for
the value function and the population density. In this paper, we show that
uniqueness of solutions to the MFGS can be guaranteed if, among all four
possible terminal and initial conditions, eitheir only two terminal or only two
initial conditions are given. In both cases H\""older stability estimates are
proven. This means that he accuracies of the solutions are estimated in terms
of the given data. Moreover, these estimates readily imply uniqueness of
corresponding problems for the MFGS. The main mathematical apparatus to
establish those results is two new Carleman estimates, which may find
application in other contexts associated with coupled parabolic PDEs.

billion by 2025. Roughly 70% of all IoT devices employ weak or no encryption;
thus, putting them and their connected infrastructure at risk of attack by
devices that are wrongly authenticated or not authenticated at all. A physical
layer security approach -- known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) --
has been proposed and is being pursued as a viable IoT security mechanism. SEI
is advantageous because it is a passive technique that exploits inherent and
distinct features that are unintentionally added to the signal by the IoT Radio
Frequency (RF) front-end. SEI's passive exploitation of unintentional signal
features removes any need to modify the IoT device, which makes it ideal for
existing and future IoT deployments. Despite the amount of SEI research
conducted, some challenges must be addressed to make SEI a viable IoT security
approach. One challenge is the extraction of SEI features from signals
collected under multipath fading conditions. Multipath corrupts the inherent
SEI features that are used to discriminate one IoT device from another; thus,
degrading authentication performance and increasing the chance of attack. This
work presents two semi-supervised Deep Learning (DL) equalization approaches
and compares their performance with the current state of the art. The two
approaches are the Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) and Joint
Convolutional Auto-Encoder and Convolutional Neural Network (JCAECNN). Both
approaches learn the channel distribution to enable multipath correction while
simultaneously preserving the SEI exploited features. CGAN and JCAECNN
performance is assessed using a Rayleigh fading channel under degrading SNR, up
to thirty-two IoT devices, and two publicly available signal sets. The JCAECNN
improves SEI performance by 10% beyond that of the current state of the art.

which the random dimer coverings form Schur processes. We study asymptotic
limits of random dimer coverings on rail yard graphs with free boundary
conditions on both the left boundary and the right boundary (double-sided free
boundary) when the mesh sizes of the graphs go to 0. Each dimer covering
corresponds to a sequence of interlacing partitions starting with an arbitrary
partition and ending in an arbitrary partition. Under the assumption that the
probability of each dimer covering is proportional to the product of weights of
present edges, we obtain the moment formula for the height function which
includes an infinite product. By passing down to the scaling limit, we compute
the limit shape (law of large numbers) of the rescaled height functions and
prove the convergence of unrescaled height fluctuations to a diffeomorphic
image of the restriction of the 0-boundary Gaussian free field (central limit
theorem) on the upper half plane to a subset. Applications include the limit
shape and height fluctuations for free boundary steep tilings as proposed in
\cite{BCC17}. The technique to obtain these results is to analyze a class of
Macdonald processes with dual specializations, subject to further complexities
arising from the infinite product in the moment formula.

where it was not present before is named alien. Due to the harm it poses to
biodiversity and the expenses associated with its control, the phenomenon of
alien species invasions is currently under careful examination. Although the
presence of a considerable literature on the subject, the formulation of a
dedicated statistical model has been deemed essential. The objective is to
overcome current computational constraints while also correctly accounting for
the dynamics behind the spread of alien species.
  A first record can be seen as a relational event, where the species (the
sender) reaches a region (the receiver) for the first time in a certain year.
As a result, whenever an alien species is introduced, the relational event
graph adds a time-stamped edge. Besides potentially time-varying exogenous and
endogenous covariates, our smooth relational event model (REM) also
incorporates time-varying and random effects to explain the invasion rate.
Particularly, we aim to track temporal variations in impacts' direction and
magnitude of the ecological, socioeconomic, historical, and cultural forces at
work. Network structures of particular interest (such as species' co-invasion
affinity) are inspected as well.
  Our inference procedure relies on case-control sampling, yielding the same
likelihood as that of a logistic regression. Due to the smooth nature of the
incorporated effects, we may fit a generalised additive model where random
effects are also estimated as 0-dimensional splines. The consequent
computational advantage makes it possible to simultaneously examine many
taxonomies. We explore how vascular plants and insects behave together. The
goodness of fit of the smooth REM may be evaluated by means of test statistics
computed as region-specific sums of martingale-residuals.

located in the upper-right neighbor of the doubly magic nuclei on the nuclear
chart (N,Z), such as those in Ba and Ra-Th regions. This systematics has been
attributed to the parity mixing of the approximately degenerate Delta l=3 pair
of single-particle levels near the Fermi surface. Purpose: Nuclear deformations
are governed in most cases by the gross shell structures of the single-particle
spectra. I will consider the systematics in octupole deformation from the view
point of the gross shell structure, and investigate the mechanism of its
manifestation using the semiclassical periodic orbit theory. Methods: To focus
on the role of deformation, simplified infinite-well (cavity) and radial
power-law potential models are employed taking account of quadrupole and
octupole shape degrees of freedom. Nuclear ground state deformations are
investigated over the nuclear chart, and the properties of the deformed shell
structures are analyzed by means of the semiclassical periodic orbit theory.
Results and conclusions: The systematics in nuclear ground-state octupole
deformations are reproduced in simplified mean-field potential models with of
without parity mixing between Delta l=3 pair of levels. The strong octupole
deformed shell effect at above the spherical shell closures are explained
simply and clearly using the semiclassical periodic-orbit theory. They are
associated with the local restoration of dynamical symmetry, which enhance the
contribution of classical periodic orbits to the gross shell effect.

meetings has increased dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic. However, not
all meetings are inclusive, especially in terms of the participation rates
among attendees. In a recent large-scale survey conducted at Microsoft, the top
suggestion given by meeting participants for improving inclusiveness is to
improve the ability of remote participants to interrupt and acquire the floor
during meetings. We show that the use of the virtual raise hand (VRH) feature
can lead to an increase in predicted meeting inclusiveness at Microsoft. One
challenge is that VRH is used in less than 1% of all meetings. In order to
drive adoption of its usage to improve inclusiveness (and participation), we
present a machine learning-based system that predicts when a meeting
participant attempts to obtain the floor, but fails to interrupt (termed a
`failed interruption'). This prediction can be used to nudge the user to raise
their virtual hand within the meeting. We believe this is the first failed
speech interruption detector, and the performance on a realistic test set has
an area under curve (AUC) of 0.95 with a true positive rate (TPR) of 50% at a
false positive rate (FPR) of <1%. To our knowledge, this is also the first

recent theoretical framing of screech as absolute instability, and further
reveal the spatial separation of individual processes for screech generation.
From the leading-order SPOD mode, direct evidence of the guided jet mode being
the screech closure mechanism, not the external acoustic feedback, is observed.
A match in the spatial wavenumber suggests the guided jet mode is generated via
interactions between the Kelvin-Helmholtz wave and the shock cells. The energy
of the oppositely-moving waves shows spatially global and non-periodic behavior
of the coherent structures in the streamwise direction. The ratio of wave
energy identifies regions where distinct processes in screech generation take
place by comparing the rate of energy propagation in the downstream direction
to that of the upstream direction. The distinct regions correspond to initial
shear layer receptivity, sound emission, guided jet mode excitation and decay
of coherence. The leading-order SPOD mode also enables the approximation of
Lighthill's stress tensor and allows for accurate calculation of the far-field

instead of Fourier transform, non-Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian, etc) to
conclude that ultimately it stems from allowing the connection to become
imaginary in a section of its contour. In turn this is the unavoidable
consequence of representing the Euclidean theory as an imaginary image within a

underlying theory and replace the connection's foray into the imaginary axis by
an actual signature change (with the connection, action and Hamiltonian
remaining real). The structural obstacles to unitarity are then removed, but
special care must still be taken, because the Euclidean theory {\it a priori}
has boundaries, so that appropriate boundary conditions are required for
unitarity. Reflecting boundary conditions would reinstate a Hartle-Hawking-like

introduction of ABCs alters the Hamiltonian structure of the dynamics, and
existing quantum algorithms can not be directly applied since the evolution is
no longer unitary. The current paper utilizes a recently introduced
Schr\""odingerisation method (Jin et al. arXiv:2212.13969 and arXiv:2212.14703)
that converts non-Hermitian dynamics to a Schr\""odinger form, for the

excellent performance on the MSTAR dataset. However, due to constrained imaging
conditions, MSTAR has data biases such as background correlation, i.e.,
background clutter properties have a spurious correlation with target classes.
Deep learning can overfit clutter to reduce training errors. Therefore, the
degree of overfitting for clutter reflects the non-causality of deep learning
in SAR ATR. Existing methods only qualitatively analyze this phenomenon. In
this paper, we quantify the contributions of different regions to target
recognition based on the Shapley value. The Shapley value of clutter measures
the degree of overfitting. Moreover, we explain how data bias and model bias
contribute to non-causality. Concisely, data bias leads to comparable
signal-to-clutter ratios and clutter textures in training and test sets. And
various model structures have different degrees of overfitting for these
biases. The experimental results of various models under standard operating
conditions on the MSTAR dataset support our conclusions. Our code is available

how the proposed model can capture the complex interaction between different

model. At inference, given one or more views of a novel real-world object, FINV
first finds a set of latent codes for the object by inverting the generative
model from multiple initial seeds. Maintaining the set of latent codes, FINV
filters and resamples them after receiving each new observation, akin to
particle filtering. The generator is then finetuned for each latent code on the

rotate slower than theoretically predicted by stellar models with purely
hydrodynamical transport processes. Recent studies on main sequence stars,
particularly Gamma Doradus ($\gamma$ Dor) stars, revealed their internal
rotation rate for hundreds of stars, offering a counterpart on the main
sequence for studies of angular momentum transport. Aims. We investigate
whether such a disagreement between observed and predicted internal rotation
rates is present in main sequence stars by studying angular momentum transport
in $\gamma$ Dor stars. Furthermore, we test whether models of rotating stars
with internal magnetic fields can reproduce their rotational properties.
Methods. We compute rotating models with the Geneva stellar evolution code
taking into account meridional circulation and the shear instability. We also
compute models with internal magnetic fields using a general formalism for
transport by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo. We then compare these models to
observational constraints for $\gamma$ Dor stars that we compiled from the
literature, combining so the core rotation rates, projected rotational
velocities from spectroscopy, and constraints on their fundamental parameters.
Results. We show that combining the different observational constraints
available for $\gamma$ Dor stars enable to clearly distinguish the different
scenarios for internal angular momentum transport. Stellar models with purely
hydrodynamical processes are in disagreement with the data whereas models with
internal magnetic fields can reproduce both core and surface constraints
simultaneously. Conclusions. Similarly to results obtained for subgiant and red
giant stars, angular momentum transport in radiative regions of $\gamma$ Dor
stars is highly efficient, in good agreement with predictions of models with
internal magnetic fields.

automatic video analysis by Artificial Intelligence is becoming more
widespread. As the amount of video used for image recognition increases,
efficient compression methods for such video data are necessary. In general,
when the image quality deteriorates due to image encoding, the image
recognition accuracy also falls. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
neural-network-based approach to improve image recognition accuracy, especially
the object detection accuracy by applying post-processing to the encoded video.
Versatile Video Coding (VVC) will be used for the video compression method,
since it is the latest video coding method with the best encoding performance.
The neural network is trained using the features of YOLO-v7, the latest object
detection model. By using VVC as the video coding method and YOLO-v7 as the
detection model, high object detection accuracy is achieved even at low bit
rates. Experimental results show that the combination of the proposed method
and VVC achieves better coding performance than regular VVC in object detection
accuracy.

dominated by point clouds captured under normal weather. We introduce
SemanticSTF, an adverse-weather point cloud dataset that provides dense
point-level annotations and allows to study 3DSS under various adverse weather
conditions. We study all-weather 3DSS modeling under two setups: 1) domain
adaptive 3DSS that adapts from normal-weather data to adverse-weather data; 2)
domain generalizable 3DSS that learns all-weather 3DSS models from
normal-weather data. Our studies reveal the challenge while existing 3DSS
methods encounter adverse-weather data, showing the great value of SemanticSTF
in steering the future endeavor along this very meaningful research direction.
In addition, we design a domain randomization technique that alternatively
randomizes the geometry styles of point clouds and aggregates their embeddings,
ultimately leading to a generalizable model that can improve 3DSS under various
adverse weather effectively. The SemanticSTF and related codes are available at

which the deterioration accelerates to end of life (EOL). The knee onset, which
marks the initiation of the accelerated degradation rate, is crucial in
providing an early warning of the battery's performance changes. However, there
is only limited literature on online knee onset identification. Furthermore, it
is good to perform such identification using easily collected measurements. To
solve these challenges, an online knee onset identification method is developed
by exploiting the temporal information within the discharge data. First, the
temporal dynamics embedded in the discharge voltage cycles from the slight
degradation stage are extracted by the dynamic time warping. Second, the
anomaly is exposed by Matrix Profile during subsequence similarity search. The
knee onset is detected when the temporal dynamics of the new cycle exceed the
control limit and the profile index indicates a change in regime. Finally, the
identified knee onset is utilized to categorize the battery into long-range or
short-range categories by its strong correlation with the battery's EOL cycles.
With the support of the battery categorization and the training data acquired
under the same statistic distribution, the proposed SOH estimation model
achieves enhanced estimation results with a root mean squared error as low as
0.22%.

shown that several relativistic mechanisms, including inverse spin-Hall effect,
inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect and inverse spin-orbit-torque effect, can
convert longitudinally injected spin-polarized currents from magnetic materials
to transverse charge currents, thereby harnessing these currents for terahertz
generation. However, these mechanisms typically require external magnetic
fields and suffer from low spin-polarization rates and low efficiencies of
relativistic spin-to-charge conversion. In this work, we present a novel
nonrelativistic and nonmagnetic mechanism that directly utilizes the
photo-excited high-density charge currents across the interface. We demonstrate
that the electrical anisotropy of conductive oxides RuO2 and IrO2 can
effectively deflect injected charge currents to the transverse direction,
resulting in efficient and broadband terahertz radiation. Importantly, this new
mechanism has the potential to offer much higher conversion efficiency compared
to previous methods, as conductive materials with large electrical anisotropy
are readily available, whereas further increasing the spin-Hall angle of
heavy-metal materials would be challenging. Our new findings offer exciting
possibilities for directly utilizing these photo-excited high-density currents

networks (HGNNs) in modeling heterogeneous information networks (HINs). In this
paper, we focus on the benchmark task of HGNNs, i.e., node classification, and
empirically find that typical HGNNs are not good at predicting the label of a
test node whose receptive field (1) has few training nodes from the same
category or (2) has multiple training nodes from different categories. A
possible explanation is that their message passing mechanisms may involve
noises from different categories, and cannot fully explore task-specific
knowledge such as the label dependency between distant nodes. Therefore,
instead of introducing a new HGNN model, we propose a general post-training
framework that can be applied on any pretrained HGNNs to further inject
task-specific knowledge and enhance their prediction performance. Specifically,
we first design an auxiliary system that estimates node labels based on (1) a
global inference module of multi-channel label propagation and (2) a local
inference module of network schema-aware prediction. The mechanism of our
auxiliary system can complement the pretrained HGNNs by providing extra
task-specific knowledge. During the post-training process, we will strengthen
both system-level and module-level consistencies to encourage the cooperation
between a pretrained HGNN and our auxiliary system. In this way, both systems
can learn from each other for better performance. In experiments, we apply our
framework to four typical HGNNs. Experimental results on three benchmark
datasets show that compared with pretrained HGNNs, our post-training framework
can enhance Micro-F1 by a relative improvement of 3.9% on average. Code, data

the best-constrained parameter given by $S'_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm

Our HSC-Y3 data exhibits about 2.5$\sigma$ tension with the Planck inferred
$S_8$ value for the $\Lambda$CDM model, and hints at a non-zero residual
photo-$z$ bias implying that the true mean redshift of the HSC galaxies at
$z\gtrsim 0.75$ is higher than that implied by the original photo-$z$
estimates.

three two-point correlation functions measured from the Year 3 Hyper
Suprime-Cam (HSC-Y3) imaging data, covering 416 deg$^2$, and the SDSS DR11
spectroscopic galaxies spanning the redshift range $[0.15, 0.70]$. We subdivide
the SDSS galaxies into three volume-limited samples separated in redshift, each
of which acts as a large-scale structure tracer characterized by the
measurement of the projected correlation function, $w_{\rm p}(R)$. We also use
the measurements of the galaxy-galaxy weak lensing signal $\Delta \Sigma(R)$
for each of these SDSS samples which act as lenses for a secure sample of
source galaxies selected from the HSC-Y3 shape catalog based on their
photometric redshifts. We combine these measurements with the cosmic shear
correlation functions, $\xi_{\pm}(\vartheta)$, measured for our HSC source
sample. We model these observables with the minimal bias model of the galaxy
clustering observables in the context of a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We use
conservative scale cuts, $R>12$ and $8~h^{-1}$Mpc, for $\Delta\Sigma$ and
$w_{\rm p}$, respectively, where the minimal bias model is valid, in addition
to conservative prior on the residual bias in the mean redshift of the HSC
photometric source galaxies. Our baseline analysis yields
$S_8=0.775^{+0.043}_{-0.038}$ (68% C.I.) for the $\Lambda$CDM model, after
marginalizing over uncertainties in other parameters. Our value of $S_8$ is
consistent with that from the Planck 2018 data, but the credible interval of
our result is still relatively large. Our results are statistically consistent
with those of a companion paper, which extends this analysis to smaller scales
with an emulator-based halo model.

network (WROSN) becomes a potential solution for on-orbit, high-capacity, and
high-speed communication. Since the inter-satellite links (ISLs) are

WROSN is assigning limited laser communication terminals for each satellite to
establish ISLs with the visible satellites. Therefore, we propose a links
assignment scheme (LAS) based on the potential edges importance matrix (PEIM)

dual-layer constellation. The simulation results showed that the LAS based on
the PEIM algorithm is better than LAS based on the random or Greedy algorithm
in terms of node-to-node distance, node pair connectivity, wavelength demand,
and transmission delay. The node pair connectivity and wavelength demand in
WROSN is a trade-off problem. The research in this paper also brings a novel
method for reduction of the cost of the on-board resources, that is through
designing topology of the ISLs with links assignment algorithm.

strong learning ability which has drawn great interest among researchers in the
field of outlier detection. However, conventional autoencoder-based methods
lacked considerations in two aspects. This limited their performance in outlier
detection. First, the mean squared error used in conventional autoencoders
ignored the judgment uncertainty of the autoencoder, which limited their
representation ability. Second, autoencoders suffered from the abnormal
reconstruction problem: some outliers can be unexpectedly reconstructed well,
making them difficult to identify from the inliers. To mitigate the
aforementioned issues, two novel methods were proposed in this paper. First, a
novel loss function named Probabilistic Reconstruction Error (PRE) was
constructed to factor in both reconstruction bias and judgment uncertainty. To
further control the trade-off of these two factors, two weights were introduced
in PRE producing Adjustable Probabilistic Reconstruction Error (APRE), which
benefited the outlier detection in different applications. Second, a
conceptually new outlier scoring method based on mean-shift (MSS) was proposed
to reduce the false inliers caused by the autoencoder. Experiments on 32
real-world outlier detection datasets proved the effectiveness of the proposed
methods. The combination of the proposed methods achieved 41% of the relative
performance improvement compared to the best baseline. The MSS improved the
performance of multiple autoencoder-based outlier detectors by an average of
20%. The proposed two methods have the potential to advance autoencoder's
development in outlier detection. The code is available on www.OutlierNet.com

quantum information processing protocol. Such interactions result in depletion
of quantum resources. Two important figure of merits in the context of quantum
information are the fully entangled fraction (FEF) and conditional entropy of a
composite quantum system. FEF has a key role to play in tasks like
teleportation. Conditional entropy on the other hand can be negative for
certain quantum states and thus the negativity remains a resource for tasks
like dense coding and state merging. FEF $ > 1/d $ for a $ d \otimes d $
quantum system is a significant threshold, however for some quantum states it
remains less than the threshold even with global unitary operations,
consequently being known as states having absolute fully entangled fraction
(AFEF). Pertaining to conditional von Neumann entropy, there are some states
which retains the nonnegativity of the conditional entropy under global unitary
action, to be called as states with absolute conditional von Neumann entropy
nonnegative (ACVENN) property. In the present submission, we probe the action
of some quantum channels in two qubits and two qudits and find that some
quantum states move from the non-absolute regime to the absolute regime under
the action. Since, global unitary operations are unable to retrieve them back
to the non-absolute regime, we provide a prescription for the retrieval using
an entanglement swapping network. Furthermore, we extend the notion of
absoluteness to conditional R\'enyi entropies and find the required condition
for a state to have absolute conditional R\'enyi entropy non-negative (ACRENN)
property. We then extend the work to include the marginals of a tripartite

with $m$ edges, then $\lambda (G)\le \sqrt{m}$, equality holds if and only if
$G$ is a complete bipartite graph. A well-known spectral conjecture of
Bollob\'{a}s and Nikiforov [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 97 (2007)] asserts that if
$G$ is a $K_{r+1}$-free graph with $m$ edges, then $\lambda_1^2(G) +
\lambda_2^2(G) \le (1-\frac{1}{r})2m$. Recently, Lin, Ning and Wu [Combin.
Probab. Comput. 30 (2021)] confirmed the conjecture in the case $r=2$. Using
this base case, they proved further that $\lambda (G)\le \sqrt{m-1}$ for every
non-bipartite triangle-free graph $G$, with equality if and only if $m=5$ and
$G=C_5$. Moreover, Zhai and Shu [Discrete Math. 345 (2022)] presented an
improvement by showing $\lambda (G) \le \beta (m)$, where $\beta(m)$ is the
largest root of $Z(x):=x^3-x^2-(m-2)x+m-3$. The equality in Zhai-Shu's result
holds only if $m$ is odd and $G$ is obtained from the complete bipartite graph
$K_{2,\frac{m-1}{2}}$ by subdividing exactly one edge. Motivated by this
observation, Zhai and Shu proposed a question to find a sharp bound when $m$ is
even. We shall solve this question by using a different method and characterize
three kinds of spectral extremal graphs over all triangle-free non-bipartite
graphs with even size. Our proof technique is mainly based on applying Cauchy's
interlacing theorem of eigenvalues of a graph, and with the aid of a triangle
counting lemma in terms of both eigenvalues and the size of a graph.

water, so a need exists to better understand the seismic response of moving
water on glaciers. We present an analytic framework to model seismic signals at

smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH) simulations. The framework is tailored to
understanding the seismic body wave response of transient moving water events
and produces a simulated dataset of water-ice collisions to predict the motion
due to body waves at any location on the glacier. The synthetic acceleration
time series generated are invariant to the simulation resolution, and consider
frequency-dependent weak dispersion and attenuation due to the propagating

subsequent flow of water through glacier channels with differing geometries.
Our focus is on the waveform attributes rather than exact waveform matching in
view of the dynamic nature of the glacier environment. The flexibility inherent
in the computational framework will allow for the simulation of seismic signals

heterogeneous remote sensing (RS) images. For this problem, an unsupervised
change detection method has been proposed recently based on the image
translation technique of Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (CycleGANs),
where one image is translated from its original modality to the modality of the
other image so that the difference map can be obtained by performing
arithmetical subtraction. However, the difference map derived from subtraction
is susceptible to image translation errors, in which case the changed area and
the unchanged area are less distinguishable. To overcome the above shortcoming,
we propose a new unsupervised copula mixture and CycleGAN-based CD method
(COMIC), which combines the advantages of copula mixtures on statistical
modeling and the advantages of CycleGANs on data mining. In COMIC, the
pre-event image is first translated from its original modality to the
post-event image modality. After that, by constructing a copula mixture, the
joint distribution of the features from the heterogeneous images can be learnt
according to quantitive analysis of the dependence structure based on the
translated image and the original pre-event image, which are of the same
modality and contain totally the same objects. Then, we model the CD problem as
a binary hypothesis testing problem and derive its test statistics based on the
constructed copula mixture. Finally, the difference map can be obtained from
the test statistics and the binary change map (BCM) is generated by K-means
clustering. We perform experiments on real RS datasets, which demonstrate the
superiority of COMIC over the state-of-the-art methods.

The other factor is the memory of the photonic environment, for which a single

regime, to exponential decay. In waveguide setup, this crossover has a time
scale longer than the retardation, thus impacts on the building up of

use in assessing text quality. We compared three kinds of reference-free
evaluation methods based on ChatGPT or similar LLMs. The experimental results
prove that ChatGPT is capable to evaluate text quality effectively from various
perspectives without reference and demonstrates superior performance than most
existing automatic metrics. In particular, the Explicit Score, which utilizes
ChatGPT to generate a numeric score measuring text quality, is the most
effective and reliable method among the three exploited approaches. However,
directly comparing the quality of two texts using ChatGPT may lead to
suboptimal results. We hope this report will provide valuable insights into

simulations but are very challenging to estimate from observations. The DM halo
density profile of observed galaxies is modelled using multiple probes that
trace the dark matter potential. However, the angular momentum distribution of
DM halos is still a subject of debate. In this study we investigate a method
for estimating the halo spin and halo concentration of low surface brightness
(LSB), gas-rich dwarf barred galaxy UGC 5288, by forward modelling disk
properties derived from observations - stellar and gas surface densities, disk
scale length, HI rotation curve, bar length and bar ellipticity. We combine
semi-analytical techniques, N-body/SPH and cosmological simulations to model
the DM halo of UGC 5288 with both a cuspy Hernquist profile and a flat-core
pseudo-isothermal profile. We find that the best match with observations is a
pseudo-isothermal halo model with a core radius of $r_{c} = 0.23$ kpc, and halo
spin of $\lambda$= 0.08 at the virial radius. Although our findings are
consistent with previous core radius estimates of the halo density profile of
UGC 5288, as well as with the halo spin profiles of similar mass analogues of
UGC5288 in the high-resolution cosmological-magneto-hydrodynamical simulation
TNG50, there still remain some uncertainties as we are limited in our knowledge
of the formation history of the galaxy. Additionally, we find that the inner
halo spin ($ r< 10$ kpc) in barred galaxies is different from the unbarred
ones, and the halo spin shows weak correlations with bar properties.

modality routinely applied in our modern healthcare. High radioactivity caused
by the injected tracer dose is a major concern in PET imaging and limits its
clinical applications. However, reducing the dose leads to inadequate image
quality for diagnostic practice. Motivated by the need to produce high quality
images with minimum low-dose, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based
methods have been developed for high quality PET synthesis from its low-dose
counterparts. Previous CNNs-based studies usually directly map low-dose PET
into features space without consideration of different dose reduction level. In
this study, a novel approach named CG-3DSRGAN (Classification-Guided Generative
Adversarial Network with Super Resolution Refinement) is presented.
Specifically, a multi-tasking coarse generator, guided by a classification
head, allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the noise-level features
present in the low-dose data, resulting in improved image synthesis. Moreover,
to recover spatial details of standard PET, an auxiliary super resolution
network - Contextual-Net - is proposed as a second-stage training to narrow the
gap between coarse prediction and standard PET. We compared our method to the
state-of-the-art methods on whole-body PET with different dose reduction
factors (DRFs). Experiments demonstrate our method can outperform others on all

we are getting the above mentioned convergence rate without the need for
characterizing the range space of modelling operator, which is in contrast to
the general convergence theory of Tikhonov-regularization for non linear

range of the adjoint of the Fr{\'e}chet derivative of modelling operator, a
challenging task for many problems.

  in fish",,,,,"q-bio.NC physics.bio-ph q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While mathematical models, in particular self-propelled particle (SPP)
models, capture many of the observed properties of large fish schools, they do
not always capture the interactions of smaller shoals. Nor do these models tend
to account for the observation that, when swimming alone or in smaller groups,
many species of fish use intermittent locomotion, often referred to as burst
and coast or burst and glide. Recent empirical studies have suggested that
burst and glide movement is indeed pivotal to the social interactions of
individual fish. In this paper, we propose a model of social burst and glide
motion by combining a well-studied model of neuronal dynamics, the
FitzHugh-Nagumo model, with a model of fish motion. We begin by showing that
the model can capture the motion of a single fish swimming down a channel. By
then extending to a two fish model, where visual stimuli of the position of the
other fish affect the internal burst or glide state of the fish, we find that
our model captures a rich set of swimming dynamics found in many species of
fish. These include: leader-follower behaviour; periodic changes in leadership;
apparently random (i.e. chaotic) leadership change; and pendulum-like
tit-for-tat turn taking. Unlike SPP models, which assume that fish move at a
constant speed, the model produces realistic motion of individual fish.
Moreover, unlike previous studies where a random component is used for
leadership switching to occur, we show that leadership switching, both periodic
and chaotic, can be the result of a deterministic interaction. We give several
empirically testable predictions on how fish interact and discuss our results
in light of recently established correlations between fish locomotion and brain
activity.

resolve the issue of unknown system dynamic, we follow the existing approach by
converting the RCP to a scenario convex program (SCP) by randomly collecting
finite samples of system trajectory. However, to improve the sample efficiency
to achieve a desired confidence bound, we provide a new posteriori method with
validation tests. Specifically, after collecting a set of data for the SCP, we
further collect another set of independent \emph{validate data} as posterior

bound for the safety of the controller that connects the original sample data,
the support constraints, and the validation data. The efficiency of the
proposed approach is illustrated by a case study of room temperature control.
We show that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach can
significantly reduce the required number of sample data to achieve a desired

predictions from a learned prediction model to plan a path for an autonomous
vehicle to adaptively and efficiently survey the region of interest. In turn,
the sampled data is used to obtain better predictions by giving an updated
initial state to the predictive model. For predictive model, we use
Knowledged-based Neural Ordinary Differential Equations to train models of
fluid processes. These models are orders of magnitude smaller in size and run
much faster than fluid data obtained from direct numerical simulations of the
partial differential equations that describe the fluid processes or other
comparable computational fluids models. For path planning, we use reinforcement
learning based planning algorithms that use the field predictions as reward
functions. We evaluate our adaptive sampling path planning algorithm on both
numerically simulated fluid data and real-world nowcast ocean flow data to show
that we can sample the spatiotemporal field in the given region of interest for
long time horizons. We also evaluate PASST algorithm's generalization ability

two-dimensional hexagonal boron nitride, which suffers from significant

timescales, the translation diffusion, metastable-state-related bunching
shoulders, rotational dynamics, and antibunching features are disentangled by
their distinct photon-correlation timescales, which collectively quantify the
normalized two-photon emission quantum yield. Leveraging its femtosecond
resolution, spectral selectivity and ultralow noise (two orders of magnitude
improvement over solid-state methods), we visualize electron-phonon coupling in
the time domain at the single defect level, and discover the acceleration of
polaronic formation driven by multi-electron excitation. Corroborated with

framework is formed by stacking two VAEs (one for image manifold learning and

It is shown that it can perform inverse design (generate a design structure for

""I poured out the bottle"" encodes the fact that the bottle became empty). We
describe REMEDI, a method for learning to map statements in natural language to
fact encodings in an LM's internal representation system. REMEDI encodings can
be used as knowledge editors: when added to LM hidden representations, they
modify downstream generation to be consistent with new facts. REMEDI encodings
may also be used as probes: when compared to LM representations, they reveal
which properties LMs already attribute to mentioned entities, in some cases
making it possible to predict when LMs will generate outputs that conflict with
background knowledge or input text. REMEDI thus links work on probing,
prompting, and LM editing, and offers steps toward general tools for
fine-grained inspection and control of knowledge in LMs.

assists an object detector by guiding it to exploit discriminative features
among cells. The features may be pathologist-provided or inferred directly from
visual data. We validate our model on two publicly available datasets (CoNSeP

reformulating the uncertain nonlinear system as an uncertain linear

  https://semanticdh.github.io/AnchorDEF",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes an anchor-based deformation model, namely AnchorDEF, to
predict 3D garment animation from a body motion sequence. It deforms a garment
mesh template by a mixture of rigid transformations with extra nonlinear
displacements. A set of anchors around the mesh surface is introduced to guide
the learning of rigid transformation matrices. Once the anchor transformations
are found, per-vertex nonlinear displacements of the garment template can be
regressed in a canonical space, which reduces the complexity of deformation
space learning. By explicitly constraining the transformed anchors to satisfy
the consistencies of position, normal and direction, the physical meaning of
learned anchor transformations in space is guaranteed for better
generalization. Furthermore, an adaptive anchor updating is proposed to
optimize the anchor position by being aware of local mesh topology for learning
representative anchor transformations. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
on different types of garments demonstrate that AnchorDEF achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on 3D garment deformation prediction in motion,
especially for loose-fitting garments.

reduce the repair bandwidth and disk I/O complexity during the storage node
repair process. A code with locality $(r,\delta)$ (also called an
$(r,\delta)$-LRC) can repair up to $\delta-1$ symbols in a codeword
simultaneously by accessing at most other $r$ symbols in the codeword. An
optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRC is a code that achieves the Singleton-type bound on
$r,\delta$, the code length, the code size and the minimum distance.
Constructing optimal LRCs receives wide attention recently. In this paper, we
give a new method to analyze the $(r,\delta)$-locality of cyclic codes. Via the
characterization of locality, we obtain several classes of optimal
$(r,\delta)$-LRCs. When the minimum distance $d$ is greater than or equal to
$2\delta+1$, we present a class of $q$-ary optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs whose code
lengths are unbounded. In contrast, the existing works only show the existence
of $q$-ary optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs of code lengths
$O(q^{1+\frac{\delta}{2}})$. When $d$ is in between $\delta$ and $2\delta$, we
present five classes of optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs whose lengths are unbounded.
Compared with the existing constructions of optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs with
unbounded code lengths, three classes of our LRCs do not have the restriction
of the distance $d\leq q$. In other words, our optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs can
have large distance over a relatively small field, which are desired by
practical requirement of high repair capability and low computation cost.
Besides, for the case of the minimal value $2$ of $\delta$, we find out all the
optimal cyclic $(r,2)$-LRCs of prime power lengths.

The main improvement is a N-1 strategy, where we consider topology actions that
keep the grid stable, even if one line is disconnected. More, we also propose a
topology reversion to the original grid, which proved to be beneficial. The
improvements are tested against reference approaches on the challenge test sets

direct comparison between rule-based and RL agent we find similar performance.
However, the RL agent has a clear computational advantage. We also analyse the

a density stratified, quiescent, viscous liquid layer with a free-surface. The
geometry is a two-dimensional, rectangular configuration taking into account
surface-tension and gravity. Linearised predictions are obtained by solving the
IVP analytically for free-surface and vortical initial perturbations. The
viscous spectrum comprises a discrete spectrum of propagating surface and
internal modes and damped vorticity modes. Continuous spectra may also exist
depending on whether the domain is bounded or unbounded. It is shown that
independent of stratification, the vorticity modes in the spectrum play an
important role. For an unstratified pool of a highly viscous liquid, the
vorticity modes are found to make a large contribution to the temporal
evolution of the transient vorticity layer, at the free-surface. It is
demonstrated that the temporal evolution of localised vortical perturbations
sufficiently deep inside the pool, cannot be captured by surface modes
(capillarity-gravity modes) and require contributions from the vorticity modes.
The free-surface signature of a deep, localised, vortical perturbation is
however found to be negligible. On a stratified pool of viscous liquid, such
vortical initial perturbations are shown to have significant projections on
vorticity as well as internal gravity modes. In the infinite depth limit of an
unstratified pool, the contribution from the continuous spectrum vorticity
modes is analysed vis-a-vis that from their finite depth, discrete spectrum
counterparts. Several analytical predictions are compared against direct
numerical simulations (DNS) obtaining excellent agreement. Our results extend
classical ones due to Lamb (1932), Yih (1960), Prosperetti (1976), Prosperetti

This paper explores the limits of a permissioned blockchain framework,

benefit from the auditability and security properties of a blockchain. We study
the potential benefits and the main limitations of such an approach. We
introduce a new design and implementation for a event-driven Fabric-ROS 2
bridge that is able to maintain lower latencies at higher network loads than
previous solutions. We also show this opens the door to more realistic use

when the applied magnetic field is in the (heat) current plane. In contrast to
the normal Hall effect, the in-plane Hall effect requires the absence of
certain crystal symmetries, and possibly manifests a non-trivial topology of
quantum materials. An accurate estimation of the intrinsic in-plane (thermal)
Hall conductivity is crucial to identify the underlying mechanisms as in the
case of the Kitaev spin-liquid candidate alpha-RuCl3. Here, we give the
symmetry conditions for the in-plane Hall effect and discuss the implications
that may impede the experimental evaluation of the in-plane (thermal) Hall
conductivity within the single-device measurement. First, the lack of symmetry
in crystals can create merohedral twin domains that cancel the total Hall
signal. Second, even in a twin-free crystal, the intrinsic response is
potentially contaminated by the out-of-plane conduction in three-dimensional
systems, which is systematically unavoidable in the in-plane Hall systems.
Third, even in a quasi-two-dimensional system, the conversion of (thermal)
resistivity, rho (lambda), to (thermal) conductivity, sigma (kappa) requires
protocols beyond the widely-used simplified formula due to the lack of
in-plane-rotational symmetry. In principle, two independent sample devices are
necessary to accurately estimate the s_xy (k_xy). As a case study, we discuss
the half-integer quantization of the in-plane thermal Hall effect in the
spin-disordered state of alpha-RuCl3. For an accurate measurement of the
thermal Hall effect, it is necessary to avoid crystals with the merohedral
twins contributing oppositely to k_xy, while the out-of-plane transport may
have a negligible effect. To deal with the field-induced rotational-symmetry
breaking, we propose two symmetry-based protocols, improved single-device and
two-device methods.

more practical and feasible approach compared to unsupervised domain adaptation

significant limitations associated with SFUDA approaches are often overlooked,
which limits their practicality in real-world applications. These limitations
include a lack of principled ways to determine optimal hyperparameters and
performance degradation when the unlabeled target data fail to meet certain
requirements such as a closed-set and identical label distribution to the
source data. All these limitations stem from the fact that SFUDA entirely
relies on unlabeled target data. We empirically demonstrate the limitations of
existing SFUDA methods in real-world scenarios including out-of-distribution
and label distribution shifts in target data, and verify that none of these
methods can be safely applied to real-world settings. Based on our experimental
results, we claim that fine-tuning a source pretrained model with a few labeled

the limitations of SFUDA. Contrary to common belief, we find that carefully
fine-tuned models do not suffer from overfitting even when trained with only a

bias. Our experimental results on various domain adaptation benchmarks
demonstrate that the few-shot fine-tuning approach performs comparatively under

conservative $2\sigma$ upper limit of $<39\,M_\oplus$. For planets b and d, we

$0.66\pm0.26\,M_{\rm Jup}$. Comparing the updated mass and radius constraints

and bandwidths. Using this approach, we designed and fabricated a waveguide
with a low and flat dispersion profile of less than 43 ps/km/nm across a
wavelength range spanning over 1000 nm. We show that, when pumped at the
telecom C-band, we can generate a supercontinuum that spans over 1.5 octave,
from approximately 817 nm to 2183 nm. The numerical simulations, whose
parameters are derived from the measured waveguide dimension and material
indices, exhibit good agreement with experimental measurements, where one can
observe both a qualitative and quantitative match in the supercontinuum overall
spectrum and specific features (e.g. soliton and dispersive wave locations).
This study represents an important step forward in the control and manipulation
of dispersive and nonlinear dynamics in highly doped silica glass waveguides,
paving the way towards advanced on-chip broadband light manipulation.

effectively distinguishing a small set of positive relations from the majority

work, we aim to achieve better integration of both the discriminability and
robustness for the DocRE problem. Specifically, we first design an effective
loss function to endow high discriminability to both probabilistic outputs and
internal representations. We innovatively customize entropy minimization and
supervised contrastive learning for the challenging multi-label and long-tailed
learning problems. To ameliorate the impact of label errors, we equipped our
method with a novel negative label sampling strategy to strengthen the model
robustness. In addition, we introduce two new data regimes to mimic more

moving frame at each time step, where the equations admit stationary solutions,
for which well-balanced techniques are suitable. Then, the solution is shifted
back to the stationary frame in a well-balanced manner. We illustrate this
methodology on parabolic reaction-diffusion equations, such as the

  Information Fusion","Accepted by ICMR 2023",,,,"cs.CV cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The easy sharing of multimedia content on social media has caused a rapid
dissemination of fake news, which threatens society's stability and security.
Therefore, fake news detection has garnered extensive research interest in the
field of social forensics. Current methods primarily concentrate on the
integration of textual and visual features but fail to effectively exploit
multi-modal information at both fine-grained and coarse-grained levels.
Furthermore, they suffer from an ambiguity problem due to a lack of correlation
between modalities or a contradiction between the decisions made by each
modality. To overcome these challenges, we present a Multi-grained Multi-modal
Fusion Network (MMFN) for fake news detection. Inspired by the multi-grained
process of human assessment of news authenticity, we respectively employ two
Transformer-based pre-trained models to encode token-level features from text
and images. The multi-modal module fuses fine-grained features, taking into
account coarse-grained features encoded by the CLIP encoder. To address the
ambiguity problem, we design uni-modal branches with similarity-based weighting
to adaptively adjust the use of multi-modal features. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
three prevalent datasets.

sound effects, replacing a musical instrument, and repairing damaged audio.
Recently, some diffusion-based methods achieved zero-shot audio editing by
using a diffusion and denoising process conditioned on the text description of
the output audio. However, these methods still have some problems: 1) they have
not been trained on editing tasks and cannot ensure good editing effects; 2)
they can erroneously modify audio segments that do not require editing; 3) they
need a complete description of the output audio, which is not always available
or necessary in practical scenarios. In this work, we propose AUDIT, an
instruction-guided audio editing model based on latent diffusion models.
Specifically, AUDIT has three main design features: 1) we construct triplet
training data (instruction, input audio, output audio) for different audio
editing tasks and train a diffusion model using instruction and input (to be
edited) audio as conditions and generating output (edited) audio; 2) it can
automatically learn to only modify segments that need to be edited by comparing
the difference between the input and output audio; 3) it only needs edit
instructions instead of full target audio descriptions as text input. AUDIT
achieves state-of-the-art results in both objective and subjective metrics for
several audio editing tasks (e.g., adding, dropping, replacement, inpainting,
super-resolution). Demo samples are available at https://audit-demo.github.io/.

presence of bare atoms in these particular situations has been confirmed by
solving Saha ionization equation taking into account the ionization potential
depression (IPD). At these temperatures, low lying excited energy levels of
parent nuclei may have thermal equilibrium population and those excited levels
may also decay via $\beta^-$ emission. The Nuclear Matrix Element (NME) of all
the transitions of the set of 15 nuclei is calculated using nuclear
shell-model. These NME are then used to calculate the comparative half-life
($ft_{1/2}$) of the transitions. Calculated terrestrial half-lives of the
$\beta^-$ decays are in good agreement with the experimental results in most of
the cases. Decay to bound and continuum states of bare atoms from
ground/isomeric levels and excited nuclear levels have been calculated
separately. The ratio of bound state to continuum state decay rates as a
function of IPD modified $Q$-value reveals that bound state $\beta^-$ decay
rate may compete and even dominate for $Q$-value $<$ 100 keV. The importance of
the bound state $\beta^-$ decay in stellar situations has been shown
explicitly. We have calculated total $\beta^-$ decay rates (bound state plus

poses an interesting mathematical challenge. When constructing analytic
waveforms in the frequency domain, one has to contend with the fact that the
phase of the Fourier integral in non-monotonic, resulting in a breakdown of the
standard stationary phase approximation. In this work, we study this breakdown
within the context of catastrophe theory. We find that the stationary phase
approximation holds in the context of eccentric Keplerian orbits when the
Fourier frequency satisfies $f_{\rm min} < f < f_{\rm max}$, where $f_{\rm
min/max}$ are integer multiples of the apocenter/pericenter frequencies,
respectively. For values outside of this interval, the phase undergoes a fold
catastrophe, giving rise to an Airy function approximation of the Fourier
integral. Using these two different approximations, we generate a matched
asymptotic expansion that approximates generic Fourier integrals of Keplerian
motion for bound orbits across all frequency values. This asymptotic expansion
is purely analytic and closed-form. We discuss several applications of this
investigation and the resulting approximation, specifically: 1) the development
and improvement of effective fly-by waveforms, 2) the transition from burst
emission in the high eccentricity limit to wave-like emission in the
quasi-circular limit, which results in an analogy between eccentric
gravitational wave bursts and Bose-Einstein condensates, and 3) the calculation
of f-mode amplitudes from stars in eccentric orbits in terms of complex Hansen
coefficients. The techniques and approximations developed herein are generic,
and will be useful for future studies of gravitational waves from eccentric

better modeled using the subsequent INR network, leading to significantly
alleviated spectral bias. Furthermore, the expressive power of the DINER is
determined by the width of the hash-table. Different width corresponds to
different geometrical elements in the attribute space, \textit{e.g.}, 1D curve,

decouple the high-dimensional conflicts and further reduce the difficulty of
obtaining feasible trajectories. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel

the first layer, based on the initial guidance trajectories, Mixed Integer
Quadratic Programming is designed to construct ISTCs capable of resolving
conflicts in generic multi-vehicle scenarios. And then in the second layer,
Non-Linear Programming is settled to generate in-corridor trajectories that
satisfy the vehicle dynamics. By introducing ISTCs, the multi-vehicle
coordinated motion planning problem is able to be decoupled into single-vehicle
trajectory optimization problems, which greatly decentralizes the computational
pressure and has great potential for real-world applications. Besides, the
proposed method searches for feasible solutions in the 3-D $(x,y,t)$

Though witnessing the great power of deep learning, existing HSI denoising
methods suffer from limitations in capturing the non-local self-similarity.
Transformers have shown potential in capturing long-range dependencies, but few
attempts have been made with specifically designed Transformer to model the
spatial and spectral correlation in HSIs. In this paper, we address these
issues by proposing a spectral enhanced rectangle Transformer, driving it to
explore the non-local spatial similarity and global spectral low-rank property
of HSIs. For the former, we exploit the rectangle self-attention horizontally
and vertically to capture the non-local similarity in the spatial domain. For
the latter, we design a spectral enhancement module that is capable of
extracting global underlying low-rank property of spatial-spectral cubes to
suppress noise, while enabling the interactions among non-overlapping spatial
rectangles. Extensive experiments have been conducted on both synthetic noisy
HSIs and real noisy HSIs, showing the effectiveness of our proposed method in
terms of both objective metric and subjective visual quality. The code is

cannot propagate circular periodic currents once rotation symmetry of the
system is broken. However a persistent current may appear due to inter-particle
interactions exceeding some critical strength. In this up-critical regime
breaking of the symmetry between the clockwise and anticlockwise rotations
takes place. We consider this symmetry-breaking scenario in the case of a
spinor condensate of exciton polaritons trapped on a ring split by a potential
barrier. Due to the intrinsic symmetry of the effective spin-orbit interaction
which stems from the linear splitting between transverse-electric and
transverse-magnetic microcavity modes, the potential barrier blocks the
circulating current and imposes linear polarization patterns. On the other
hand, circularly polarized polaritons form circular currents propagating in
opposite directions with equal absolute values of angular momentum. In the
presence of inter-particle interactions, the symmetry of clockwise and
anticlockwise currents can be broken spontaneously. We describe several
symmetry-breaking scenarios which imply either restoration of the global
condensate rotation or the onset of the circular polarization in the
symmetry-broken state.

modern information theory, the goal of communications has long been promising
accurate message reconstruction at a refined bit-by-bit level, which
deliberately neglects the semantics/effectiveness aspect of information.
Nevertheless, the recent development of wireless technologies and the spurt of
deep learning (DL) techniques allow us to reclaim the meaning/usefulness aspect
in the design of future 6G communication paradigms, where goal-oriented
communication is becoming a trend. Age of Information (AoI), a well-known
metric that captures the importance of information by recording the time
elapsed from the generation time slot, has been extended to various variants,
such as Value of Information (VoI), Urgency of Information (UoI), Age of
Incorrect Information (AoII), and etc. While each of them proposes novel ways
to measure the meaning/usefulness aspect of information, there is not yet an
integrated framework encompassing all of them. To this end, we propose a novel
tensor-based approach, the Goal-oriented Tensor (GoT), to unify them, which
also allows more flexible and fine-grained goal characterizations. Following
the proposed GoT, we architect a holistic goal-oriented framework to enable
goal-oriented semantic communications, in which information perception,
dissemination, and control-plane decisions are implemented in accordance with
specific goals. Finally, we outline several open challenges to fulfill the
vision of the GoT framework.

to late-A types during the main sequence phase. F stars, either with or without
hot Jupiters, are usually X-ray emitters. The very low level of X-ray emission
of the F5 star WASP-18 despite its relatively young age and spectral type is
thus quite peculiar. [Abridged] We observed KELT-24 with \xmm\ for a total of
43 ks in order to test if the X-ray activity of this star is depressed by the
interaction with its massive hot Jupiter, as is the case of WASP-18. KELT-24 is
detected in combined EPIC images with a high significance level. Its average
coronal spectrum is well described by a cool component at 0.36 keV and a hotter
component at 0.98 keV. We detected a flare with a duration of about 2 ks,
during which the coronal temperature reached 3.5 keV. The unabsorbed quiescent
flux in 0.3-8.0 keV is $\sim1.33\times10^{-13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$,
corresponding to a luminosity of $1.5\times10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the
distance of the star. The luminosity is well within the range of the typical
X-ray luminosity of F stars in Hyades, which are coeval. We conclude that the
activity of KELT-24 appears normal, as expected, and is not affected by any
star--planet interaction. From the analysis of TESS light curves, we infer a
distribution of optical flares for KELT-24 and WASP-18. Small optical
flickering similar to flares is recognized in WASP-18 but at lower levels of
energy and amplitude than in KELT-24. We discuss the causes of the low activity
of WASP-18. Either WASP-18b could hamper the formation of a corona bright in
X-rays in its host star through some form of tidal interaction, or the star has
entered a minimum of activity similar to the solar Maunder minimum. This latter
hypothesis would make WASP-18 among the few candidates showing such a quench of
stellar activity.

significantly suppresses the view-specific information on the representation
space where the viewpoints are coarsely aligned. By maximizing mutual

FoCoViL associates actions with common view-invariant properties and
simultaneously separates the dissimilar ones. We further propose an adaptive
focalization method based on pairwise similarity to enhance contrastive
learning for a clearer cluster boundary in the learned space. Different from
many existing self-supervised representation learning work that rely heavily on
supervised classifiers, FoCoViL performs well on both unsupervised and

periods might result in different findings. Practical implications: When
funding to publish in open or hybrid access journals is not available, it is
advisable to self-archiving the pre-print or post-print version in a freely

applications ranging from two-qubit gate generation to optimization of receiver

manipulation is among important tasks to study for such systems. Typically
coherent control, e.g. a shaped laser pulse, is used to manipulate two-qubit
systems. However, the environment can also be used $\unicode{x2013}$ as an
incoherent control resource. In this article, we consider optimal state
manipulation for a two-qubit system whose dynamics is governed by the
Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation, where coherent control
enters into the Hamiltonian and incoherent control into both the Hamiltonian
(via Lamb shift) and the superoperator of dissipation. We exploit two
physically different classes of interaction with coherent control and optimize
the Hilbert-Schmidt overlap between final and target density matrices,
including optimization of its steering to a given value. We find the conditions
when zero coherent and incoherent controls satisfy the Pontryagin maximum
principle, and in addition, when they form a stationary point of the objective
functional. Moreover, we find a case when this stationary point provides the
globally minimal value of the overlap. Using upper and lower bounds for the
overlap, we develop one- and two-step gradient projection methods operating
with functional controls.

onboard {\em AstroSat} along with ground-based data (UBVRI filters), {\em

Based on the FUV-optical colour-magnitude diagrams, we classify the sources
into the horizontal branch (HB) stars, post-HB stars, and hot white dwarfs
(WDs) in both the GCs. The comparison of synthetic and observed colours of the
observed HB stars suggests that the mass-loss at the red giant branch (RGB) and
He spread in both clusters have a simultaneous effect on the different HB
distributions detected in M3 and M13, such that, HB stars of M13 require a
larger spread in He (${\rm 0.247-0.310}$) than those of M3 (${\rm Y=
0.252-0.266}$). The evolutionary status of HB stars, post-HB stars, and WDs are
studied using SED fit parameters and theoretical evolutionary tracks on the H-R
diagram. We found that the observed post-HB stars have evolved from zero-age HB
(ZAHB) stars of the mass range $0.48-0.55$ \Msun\ in M3 and M13. We detect 24
WD candidates in each cluster having ${\rm \log(L_{bol}/L_\odot)}$ in the range
$-0.8$ to $+0.6$ and ${\rm \log(T_{eff}/K)}$ in the range of 4.2 to 5.0.
Placing the WDs on the H-R diagram and comparing them with models suggest that
M13 has a population of low-mass WDs, probably originating from binary
evolution.

Efimov states, which appear in the limit of a diverging two-body scattering
length. Using this model, we calculate three-body adiabatic and effective
potential curves and study how the strength (or width) of the Feshbach
resonance affects the three-body potential that is connected to the Efimov
effect. We find that the position of the repulsive barrier, which has been used
to explain the so-called van der Waals universality in broad resonances, is
slightly shifted as the narrow resonance limit is approached and that this
shift is correlated to the appearance of two avoided crossings in the adiabatic
energy landscape. More importantly, the attractive well is markedly shifted
upward in energy and is extremely shallow for the narrowest resonance. We argue
that this behavior is connected to the breakdown of van der Waals universality
for weak (narrow) resonances.

capture-recapture (CR) experiments, it carries a higher risk of
misidentifications than direct observations. As a consequence, one must screen
the data to retain only the reliable data before applying a classical CR model.
This procedure is unacceptable when too few data would remain. Models able to
deal with misidentifications have been proposed but are barely used. Three
objectives are pursued in this paper. First, we present the Latent Multinomial
Model of Link et al. (2010) where estimates of the model are obtained from a
Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC). Second we show the impact of the use of an
informative prior over the estimations when the capture rate is low. Finally we
extend the model to the multistate paradigm as an example of its flexibility.
  We showed that, without prior information, with capture rate at 0.2 or lower,
parameters of the model are difficult to estimate i.e. either the MCMC does not
converge or the estimates are biased. In that case, we show that adding an
informative prior on the identification probability solves the identifiability
problem of the model and allow for convergence. It also allows for good quality
estimates of population size, although when the capture rate is 0.1 it
underestimates it of about 10%. A similar approach on the multistate extension

indexing, that is, preprocessing a given string for specific queries. By now we
have a number of efficient solutions for this problem when the queries ask for
an exact occurrence of a given pattern $P$. However, practical applications
motivate the necessity of considering more complex queries, for example
concerning near occurrences of two patterns. Recently, Bille et al. [CPM 2021]
introduced a variant of such queries, called gapped consecutive occurrences, in
which a query consists of two patterns $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ and a range $[a,b]$,
and one must find all consecutive occurrences $(q_1,q_2)$ of $P_{1}$ and
$P_{2}$ such that $q_2-q_1 \in [a,b]$. By their results, we cannot hope for a
very efficient indexing structure for such queries, even if $a=0$ is fixed
(although at the same time they provided a non-trivial upper bound). Motivated
by this, we focus on a text given as a straight-line program (SLP) and design
an index taking space polynomial in the size of the grammar that answers such
queries in time optimal up to polylog factors.

samples to the ES results in high inference accuracy, but it defeats the
purpose of embedding S-ML on the ED and deprives the benefits of reduced
latency, bandwidth savings, and energy efficiency of doing local inference. To
get the best out of both worlds, i.e., the benefits of doing inference on the
ED and the benefits of doing inference on ES, we explore the idea of
Hierarchical Inference (HI), wherein S-ML inference is only accepted when it is
correct, otherwise the data sample is offloaded for L-ML inference. However,
the ideal implementation of HI is infeasible as the correctness of the S-ML
inference is not known to the ED. We thus propose an online meta-learning
framework to predict the correctness of the S-ML inference. The resulting
online learning problem turns out to be a Prediction with Expert Advice (PEA)
problem with continuous expert space. We consider the full feedback scenario,
where the ED receives feedback on the correctness of the S-ML once it accepts
the inference, and the no-local feedback scenario, where the ED does not
receive the ground truth for the classification, and propose the HIL-F and
HIL-N algorithms and prove a regret bound that is sublinear with the number of

and data used during training. However it is often desirable to tune the model
at inference time based on external factors such as preferences of the user or
dynamic characteristics of the data. This is especially important to balance
the perception-distortion trade-off of ill-posed image-to-image translation
tasks. In this work, we propose to optimize a parametric tunable convolutional
layer, which includes a number of different kernels, using a parametric
multi-loss, which includes an equal number of objectives. Our key insight is to
use a shared set of parameters to dynamically interpolate both the objectives
and the kernels. During training, these parameters are sampled at random to
explicitly optimize all possible combinations of objectives and consequently
disentangle their effect into the corresponding kernels. During inference,
these parameters become interactive inputs of the model hence enabling reliable
and consistent control over the model behavior. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our tunable convolutions effectively work as a drop-in
replacement for traditional convolutions in existing neural networks at
virtually no extra computational cost, outperforming state-of-the-art control
strategies in a wide range of applications; including image denoising,
deblurring, super-resolution, and style transfer.

  Degradation?",,,,,"cs.PF","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  In the context of decision making under explorable uncertainty, scheduling
with testing is a powerful technique used in the management of computer systems
to improve performance via better job-dispatching decisions. Upon job arrival,
a scheduler may run some \emph{testing algorithm} against the job to extract
some information about its structure, e.g., its size, and properly classify it.
The acquisition of such knowledge comes with a cost because the testing
algorithm delays the dispatching decisions, though this is under control. In
this paper, we analyze the impact of such extra cost in a load balancing
setting by investigating the following questions: does it really pay off to
test jobs? If so, under which conditions? Under mild assumptions connecting the
information extracted by the testing algorithm in relationship with its running
time, we show that whether scheduling with testing brings a performance
degradation or improvement strongly depends on the traffic conditions, system
size and the coefficient of variation of job sizes. Thus, the general answer to
the above questions is non-trivial and some care should be considered when
deploying a testing policy. Our results are achieved by proposing a load
balancing model for scheduling with testing that we analyze in two limiting
regimes. When the number of servers grows to infinity in proportion to the
network demand, we show that job-size testing actually degrades performance
unless short jobs can be predicted reliably almost instantaneously \emph{and}
the network load is sufficiently high. When the coefficient of variation of job
sizes grows to infinity, we construct testing policies inducing an arbitrarily
large performance gain with respect to running jobs untested.

grow in size, visualizing them effectively becomes challenging. Downsampling,
which involves data aggregation or selection, is a well-established approach to
overcome this challenge. This work focuses on data selection algorithms, which
accomplish downsampling by selecting values from the original time series.
Despite their widespread adoption in visualization platforms and time series
databases, there is limited literature on the evaluation of these techniques.
To address this, we propose an extensive metrics-based evaluation methodology.
Our methodology analyzes visual representativeness by assessing how well a
downsampled time series line chart visually approximates the original data.
Moreover, our methodology includes a novel concept called ""visual stability"",
which captures visual changes when updating (streaming) or interacting with the
visualization (panning and zooming). We evaluated four data point selection
algorithms across three open-source visualization toolkits using our proposed
methodology, considering various figure-drawing properties. Following the
analysis of our findings, we formulated a set of evidence-based guidelines for
line chart visualization at scale with downsampling. To promote reproducibility
and enable the qualitative evaluation of new advancements in time series data
point selection, we have made our methodology and results openly accessible.

online advertising and recommendation. While multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
serves as a core component in many deep CTR prediction models, it has been
widely recognized that applying a vanilla MLP network alone is inefficient in
learning multiplicative feature interactions. As such, many two-stream
interaction models (e.g., DeepFM and DCN) have been proposed by integrating an
MLP network with another dedicated network for enhanced CTR prediction. As the
MLP stream learns feature interactions implicitly, existing research focuses
mainly on enhancing explicit feature interactions in the complementary stream.
In contrast, our empirical study shows that a well-tuned two-stream MLP model
that simply combines two MLPs can even achieve surprisingly good performance,
which has never been reported before by existing work. Based on this
observation, we further propose feature gating and interaction aggregation
layers that can be easily plugged to make an enhanced two-stream MLP model,
FinalMLP. In this way, it not only enables differentiated feature inputs but
also effectively fuses stream-level interactions across two streams. Our
evaluation results on four open benchmark datasets as well as an online A/B
test in our industrial system show that FinalMLP achieves better performance
than many sophisticated two-stream CTR models. Our source code will be

additional workload, in-creasing teacher ownership and trust, generating

are also essential for the adoption of AI in schools and may predict teachers
engagement with the platform better. We conclude the paper with a discussion on

a hydrostatically loaded radial fracture. This limit depends on the mechanical
properties of the surrounding solid and the density contrast between the fluid
and the solid. Self-sustained fracture growth is characterized by two
dimensionless numbers. The first parameter is a buoyancy factor that compares
the total released volume to the limiting volume to determine whether buoyant
growth occurs. The second parameter is the dimensionless viscosity of a radial
fracture at the time when buoyant effects become of order 1. This dimensionless
viscosity notably depends on the rate at which the fluid volume is released,
indicating that both the total volume and release history impact self-sustained
buoyant growth. Six well-defined propagation histories can be identified based
on these two dimensionless numbers. Their growth evolves between distinct
limiting regimes of radial and buoyant propagation, resulting in different
fracture shapes. We can identify two growth rates depending on the dominant
energy dissipation mechanism (viscous flow vs fracture creation) in the
fracture head. For finite values of material toughness, the toughness-dominated
limit represents a late-time solution for all fractures in growth rate and head
shape (possibly reached only at a very late time). The viscosity-dominated
limit can appear at intermediate times. Our three-dimensional simulations
confirm the predicted scalings and highlight the importance of considering the
entire propagation and release history for accurate analysis of buoyant
hydraulic fractures.

  added; the benchmark model is switched. Main conclusion unchanged",,,,"hep-ph astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The nature of dark matter (DM) remains one of the most important unanswered
questions in particle physics. Here, we propose a novel scenario for DM in
which weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can freeze-in due to a
first-order phase transition (FOPT) in the early Universe. The FOPT dilutes the
pre-existing DM density to zero and leads to a sudden change in DM mass,
preventing WIMPs from re-equilibrating due to their large mass-to-temperature
ratio. Following the FOPT, WIMPs are produced via a freeze-in process, even
though their interactions are NOT feeble. We demonstrate this concept using a
simplified model and then apply it to a realistic model with a delayed
electroweak phase transition. Our work presents a promising new direction for
the freeze-in mechanism, and also extends the category of WIMP DM.

proposes an extension to PINNs called Laplace-based fractional physics-informed

introducing a mass of auxiliary points and simplifies the loss function. We
validate the effectiveness of the Laplace-fPINNs approach using several

effectively solve both the forward and inverse problems of high-dimensional

next-best-view (NBV) methods that can autonomously perform 3D reconstruction of
unknown objects. However, they are slowed down by local path planning, which is
improved by our previously proposed set-covering-based network SCVP using
one-shot view planning and global path planning. In this work, we propose a
combined pipeline that selects a few NBVs before activating the network to
improve model completeness. However, this pipeline will result in more views
than expected because the SCVP has not been trained from multiview scenarios.
To reduce the overall number of views and paths required, we propose a
multiview-activated architecture MA-SCVP and an efficient dataset sampling
method for view planning based on a long-tail distribution. Ablation studies
confirm the optimal network architecture, the sampling method and the number of
samples, the NBV method and the number of NBVs in our combined pipeline.
Comparative experiments support the claim that our system achieves faster and
more complete reconstruction than state-of-the-art systems. For the reference

of all systems, the resource will have to be shared in an optimal fashion. In
this scenario, we want the systems to automatically converge to an optimal

architecture where each separate system is controlled by a local PI controller.
The controllers are then coordinated through a global rank-one anti-windup

minimizes the infinity-norm of stationary state deviations. Convergence is
investigated via a randomized numerical study, and a district heating-inspired

  We propose a novel sampling-based iterative algorithm, the iterated diffusion
bridge mixture transport (IDBM), aimed at solving the dynamic Schr\""odinger

  Recent advancements in generative modeling employ the time-reversal of a
diffusion process to define a generative process that approximately transports
a simple distribution to the data distribution. As an alternative, we propose
using the first iteration of the IDBM procedure as an approximation-free method
for realizing this transport. This approach offers greater flexibility in
selecting the generative process dynamics and exhibits faster training and
superior sample quality over longer discretization intervals. In terms of
implementation, the necessary modifications are minimally intrusive, being
limited to the training loss computation, with no changes necessary for
generative sampling.

model message passing among nodes. The messages are often deterministic.
Questions naturally arise: Does there exist uncertainty in the messages? How
could we propagate such uncertainty over a graph together with messages? To
address these issues, we propose a Bayesian uncertainty propagation (BUP)
method, which embeds GNNs in a Bayesian modeling framework, and models
predictive uncertainty of node classification with Bayesian confidence of
predictive probability and uncertainty of messages. Our method proposes a novel
uncertainty propagation mechanism inspired by Gaussian models. Moreover, we
present an uncertainty oriented loss for node classification that allows the
GNNs to clearly integrate predictive uncertainty in learning procedure.
Consequently, the training examples with large predictive uncertainty will be
penalized. We demonstrate the BUP with respect to prediction reliability and
out-of-distribution (OOD) predictions. The learned uncertainty is also analyzed
in depth. The relations between uncertainty and graph topology, as well as
predictive uncertainty in the OOD cases are investigated with extensive
experiments. The empirical results with popular benchmark datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of the proposed method.

of zirconium hydrides is accompanied by a transformation strain, the effects of
which on the development of localized deformation zones are not
well-understood. This study uses a crystal plasticity finite element model that
is coupled with diffusion subroutines to quantify such effects. For this
purpose, a zirconium specimen was hydrided in the absence of any external
mechanical loads. With the use of electron backscatter diffraction, the
rotation fields around the inter and intragranular hydrides as well as those
located at grain boundaries or triple points were measured at a high spatial
resolution. The as-measured zirconium and hydride morphologies were mapped to
the model for numerical simulation. Both numerical and experimental results
show that hydride precipitation induces large rotation fields within the
zirconium matrix, where such rotations are at their maximum in the vicinity of
hydride tips. While the crystallographic orientations and shapes of hydrides
affect the magnitude of rotation fields, both experimental and modeling results
revealed the development of discrete and parallel geometrically necessary
dislocation fields. It is shown that the stress field resulting from hydride
precipitation affects the patterning of hydrogen distribution, which in return
affects further hydride interlinking.

abundance measurement of Si, S, Ar, Ca and Fe, in four prominent diffuse X-ray
features located in the central parsec of the Galaxy, which are the
manifestation of shock-heated hot gas. A two-temperature, non-equilibrium
ionization spectral model is employed to derive the abundances of these five
elements. In this procedure, a degeneracy is introduced due to uncertainties in
the composition of light elements, in particular, H, C and N. Assuming that the
hot gas is H-depleted but C- and N-enriched, as would be expected for a
standard scenario in which the hot gas is dominated by Wolf-Rayet star winds,
the spectral fit finds a generally subsolar abundance for the heavy elements.
If, instead, the light elements had a solar-like abundance, the heavy elements
have a fitted abundance of $\sim$1--2 solar. The $\alpha$/Fe abundance ratio,
on the other hand, is mostly supersolar and insensitive to the exact
composition of the light elements. These results are robust against potential
biases due to either a moderate spectral S/N or the presence of non-thermal

emission up to a polarization degree of ~80%. However, such expectations are
being challenged by recent observations of XRPs with the Imaging X-ray
Polarimeter Explorer (IXPE). Here we report on the results of yet another XRP,
EXO 2030+375, observed with IXPE and contemporarily monitored with Insight-HXMT

sources, analysis of the EXO 2030+375 data returns a low polarization degree of
0%-3% in the phase-averaged study and variation in the range 2%-7% in the
phase-resolved study. Using the rotating vector model we constrain the geometry
of the system and obtain a value for the magnetic obliquity of ~$60^{\circ}$.
Considering also the estimated pulsar inclination of ~$130^{\circ}$, this
indicates that the magnetic axis swings close to the observer line of sight.
Our joint polarimetric, spectral and timing analysis hint to a complex
accreting geometry where magnetic multipoles with asymmetric topology and
gravitational light bending significantly affect the observed source behavior.

social topology is taken into account. The model is able to predict successive
waves of infections without the need to account for reinfections, and it can
qualitatively reproduce the wave patterns observed across many countries during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequent waves can have a higher peak of infections if
the restrictiveness of the lockdown is above a certain threshold. The model is
flexible and can implement various social distancing strategies by adjusting
the restrictiveness and the duration of lockdown measures or specifying whether
they occur once or repeatedly. It also includes the option to consider
essential workers that do not isolate during a lockdown.

attention of the whole world to it. Carbon footprint is the main factor that
drives greenhouse emissions up and results in the temperature increase of the

reducing carbon emissions by transportation, food consumption and household
activities, we ignore the contribution of CO2eq emissions produced by online
activities. In the current information era, we spend a big amount of our days
browsing online. This activity consumes electricity which in turn produces
CO2eq. While website browsing contributes to the production of greenhouse gas
emissions, the impact of the Internet on the environment is further exacerbated
by the web-tracking practice. Indeed, most webpages are heavily loaded by
tracking content used mostly for advertising, data analytics and usability
improvements. This extra content implies big data transmissions which results
in higher electricity consumption and thus higher greenhouse gas emissions. In
this work, we focus on the overhead caused by web tracking and analyse both its
network and carbon footprint. By leveraging the browsing telemetry of 100k
users and the results of a crawling experiment of 2.7M websites, we find that
web tracking increases data transmissions upwards of 21%, which in turn implies
the additional emission of around 11 Mt of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
every year. We find such contribution to be far from negligible, and comparable
to many activities of modern life, such as meat production, transportation, and
even cryptocurrency mining. Our study also highlights that there exist
significant inequalities when considering the footprint of different countries,
website categories, and tracking organizations, with a few actors contributing
to a much greater extent than the remaining ones.

capacity of combining the strengths of deep learning and probabilistic models

continuous and dense. However in many applications, sparse representations are
expected, such as learning sparse high dimensional embedding of data in an
unsupervised setting, and learning multi-labels from thousands of candidate
tags in a supervised setting. In some scenarios, there could be further
restriction on degree of sparsity: the number of non-zero features of a
representation cannot be larger than a pre-defined threshold $L_0$. In this
paper we propose a sparse deep latent generative model SDLGM to explicitly
model degree of sparsity and thus enable to learn the sparse structure of the
data with the quantified sparsity constraint. The resulting sparsity of a
representation is not fixed, but fits to the observation itself under the
pre-defined restriction. In particular, we introduce to each observation $i$ an
auxiliary random variable $L_i$, which models the sparsity of its
representation. The sparse representations are then generated with a two-step
sampling process via two Gumbel-Softmax distributions. For inference and
learning, we develop an amortized variational method based on MC gradient
estimator. The resulting sparse representations are differentiable with
backpropagation. The experimental evaluation on multiple datasets for
unsupervised and supervised learning problems shows the benefits of the

geometry which is the metric space comprising the second derivatives of entropy

black holes (RNBHs) are known to be endowed with a flat Ruppeiner geometry for
all higher spacetime dimensions. However this holds true if one invokes
classical gravity where the semi-classical Bekenstein-Hawking entropy best
describes the thermodynamics of the system. If the much deeper string and
quantum gravity theories entail modifications to BH entropy, this prompts the
question whether the Ruppeiner flatness associated with higher dimensional
RNBHs still persists. We investigate this problem by considering
non-perturbative (exponential) and perturbative (logarithmic) modifications to
BH entropy of a $5$D RNBH. We find that while the case is so for larger
(classical) geometries, the situation is radically altered for smaller
(quantum) geometries. Namely, we show surprising emergence of multiple phase
transitions that depend on the choice of extent of corrections to BH entropy
and the BH charge. More emphasis is laid on the exponential case as the
contributions become highly non-trivial on small scales. An essential critical
mass scale arises in this case, that marks the onset of these phase transitions
while the BH diminishes in size via Hawking evaporation. We contend that this
critical value of mass perhaps best translates as the epoch of a classical to
quantum BH phase transition.

accurate electronic structure theory for a set of points on the path are fitted
with a machine-learning technique (in our case symmetric gradient domain
machine learning or sGDML) to produce a semi-local reactive Potential Energy
Surface (PES), embracing reactants, products and transition state (TS) regions.
This approach has been successfully applied to a unimolecular (Bergman
cyclization of enediyne) and a bimolecular (S$_\text{N}$2 substitution)
reaction. In particular, we demonstrate that with only 50 to 150 energy-force
evaluations with the accurate reference methods (here CASSCF and CCSD) it is
possible to construct a semi-local PES giving qualitative agreement for
stationary-point geometries, intrinsic reaction-coordinates and barriers.
Furthermore, we find a qualitative agreement in vibrational frequencies and
reaction rate coefficients. The key aspect of the method's performance is its
multi-scale nature, which not only saves computational effort but also allows
extracting meaningful information along the reaction path, characterized by
zero gradients in all but one direction. Agnostic to the nature of the TS and
computationally economic, the protocol can be readily automated and routinely

same class. The motion autodecoder is a lightweight architecture to reconstruct
pixel motions from the differential features, which explicitly embeds the
network with motion dynamics. By this means, MoLo can simultaneously learn
long-range temporal context and motion cues for comprehensive few-shot
matching. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we evaluate MoLo on five standard

views at interactive rates. Since SRT uses camera poses with respect to an
arbitrarily chosen reference camera, it is not invariant to the order of the
input views. As a result, SRT is not directly applicable to large-scale scenes
where the reference frame would need to be changed regularly. In this work, we
propose Relative Pose Attention SRT (RePAST): Instead of fixing a reference
frame at the input, we inject pairwise relative camera pose information
directly into the attention mechanism of the Transformers. This leads to a
model that is by definition invariant to the choice of any global reference
frame, while still retaining the full capabilities of the original method.
Empirical results show that adding this invariance to the model does not lead
to a loss in quality. We believe that this is a step towards applying fully
latent transformer-based rendering methods to large-scale scenes.

non-linear data distributions through a number of latent variables and these
models use a nonlinear function (generator) to map latent samples into the data

latent space shows an unsatisfactory projection of the data space, which
results in poor representation learning. This weak projection, however, can be
addressed by a Riemannian metric, and we show that geodesics computation and
accurate interpolations between data samples on the Riemannian manifold can
substantially improve the performance of deep generative models. In this paper,
a Variational spatial-Transformer AutoEncoder (VTAE) is proposed to minimize
geodesics on a Riemannian manifold and improve representation learning. In
particular, we carefully design the variational autoencoder with an encoded
spatial-Transformer to explicitly expand the latent variable model to data on a
Riemannian manifold, and obtain global context modelling. Moreover, to have
smooth and plausible interpolations while traversing between two different
objects' latent representations, we propose a geodesic interpolation network
different from the existing models that use linear interpolation with inferior
performance. Experiments on benchmarks show that our proposed model can improve
predictive accuracy and versatility over a range of computer vision tasks,

multimode optomechanics, it becomes an interesting topic to create quadrature
squeezing in multiple mechanical resonators. However, in the
multiple-degenerate-mechanical-mode optomechanical systems, the dark-mode
effect strongly suppresses the quantum effects in mechanical modes. Here we
study the generation of mechanical squeezing in a two-mechanical-mode
optomechanical system by breaking the dark-mode effect with the
synthetic-gauge-field method. We find that when the mechanical modes work at a
finite temperature, the mechanical squeezing is weak or even disappeared due to
the dark-mode effect, while the strong mechanical squeezing can be generated
once the dark-mode effect is broken. In particular, the
thermal-phonon-occupation tolerance of the mechanical squeezing is
approximately three orders of magnitude larger than that without breaking the
dark-mode effect. We also generalize this method to break the dark modes and to
create the mechanical squeezing in a multiple-mechanical-mode optomechanical

(HoP) for multi-view 3D detection to leverage temporal information more
effectively. The HoP approach is straightforward: given the current timestamp
t, we generate a pseudo Bird's-Eye View (BEV) feature of timestamp t-k from its
adjacent frames and utilize this feature to predict the object set at timestamp
t-k. Our approach is motivated by the observation that enforcing the detector
to capture both the spatial location and temporal motion of objects occurring
at historical timestamps can lead to more accurate BEV feature learning. First,
we elaborately design short-term and long-term temporal decoders, which can
generate the pseudo BEV feature for timestamp t-k without the involvement of
its corresponding camera images. Second, an additional object decoder is
flexibly attached to predict the object targets using the generated pseudo BEV
feature. Note that we only perform HoP during training, thus the proposed
method does not introduce extra overheads during inference. As a plug-and-play
approach, HoP can be easily incorporated into state-of-the-art BEV detection
frameworks, including BEVFormer and BEVDet series. Furthermore, the auxiliary
HoP approach is complementary to prevalent temporal modeling methods, leading
to significant performance gains. Extensive experiments are conducted to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed HoP on the nuScenes dataset. We

allows the bacterium Escherichia coli to divide even faster than the time it
takes to replicate the entire chromosome in nutrient-rich environments. What
mechanisms give rise to synchronous replication initiation remains however
poorly understood. Via mathematical modelling, we identify four distinct
synchronization regimes depending on two quantities: the duration of the
so-called licensing period during which the initiation potential in the cell
remains high after the first origin has fired and the duration of the blocking
period during which already initiated origins remain blocked. For synchronous
replication initiation, the licensing period must be long enough such that all
origins can be initiated, but shorter than the blocking period to prevent
reinitiation of origins that have already fired. We find an analytical
expression for the degree of synchrony as a function of the duration of the
licensing period, which we confirm by simulations. Our model reveals that the
delay between the firing of the first and the last origin scales with the
coefficient of variation (CV) of the initiation volume. Matching these to the
values measured experimentally shows that the firing rate must rise with the
cell volume with an effective Hill coefficient that is at least 20; the
probability that all origins fire before the blocking period is over is then at
least 92%. Our analysis thus reveals that the low CV of the initiation volume
is a consequence of synchronous replication initiation. Finally, we show that
the previously presented molecular model for the regulation of replication
initiation in E. coli can give rise to synchronous replication initiation for
biologically realistic parameters.

commonly used technique for predicting biological activities of compounds using
their molecular descriptors. Predictions from QSAR models can help, for
example, to optimize molecular structure; prioritize compounds for further
experimental testing; and estimate their toxicity. In addition to the accurate
estimation of the activity, it is highly desirable to obtain some estimate of
the uncertainty associated with the prediction, e.g., calculate a prediction
interval (PI) containing the true molecular activity with a pre-specified
probability, say 70%, 90% or 95%. The challenge is that most machine learning
(ML) algorithms that achieve superior predictive performance require some
add-on methods for estimating uncertainty of their prediction. The development
of these algorithms is an active area of research by statistical and ML
communities but their implementation for QSAR modeling remains limited.
Conformal prediction (CP) is a promising approach. It is agnostic to the
prediction algorithm and can produce valid prediction intervals under some weak
assumptions on the data distribution. We proposed computationally efficient CP
algorithms tailored to the most advanced ML models, including Deep Neural
Networks and Gradient Boosting Machines. The validity and efficiency of
proposed conformal predictors are demonstrated on a diverse collection of QSAR

electrically controllable qubits in a two-dimensional system. Of particular
interest is the ability to encode quantum information not only as spin qubits
but also in the so-called valley degree of freedom, a two-fold orbital
degeneracy that arises from the symmetry of the hexagonal Bravais lattice.
Known spin-mixing and orbital-mixing mechanisms are unlikely to be at work for
valleys. Moreover, the topological nature of valley states in BLG promises
unique routes for coherent qubit manipulation. Gate-defined BLG quantum-dot
devices have been recently established as a versatile building block for
accessing high-quality spin and valley quantum states. However, measurements of
the relaxation time of valley states -- which ultimately limits these qubits'
coherence properties and therefore their suitability as practical qubits --
remained so far elusive. Here we report the first measurement of the
characteristic relaxation times of spin and valley states, obtained in a
high-quality BLG device containing gate-defined double quantum dots. We show
that valley states can be distinguished with a fidelity of well above
$99\,\text{%}$ and report remarkably long relaxation time between valley
triplets and singlets, exceeding $500\,\text{ms}$ at $B=250\,\text{mT}$, more
than one order of magnitude longer than the relaxation times we measure for
spin states. Our approach to isolating valley states paves the way to measuring
coherent valley-qubit oscillations and, in combination with the recently
demonstrated electrical tunability of the valley $g$-factor, could provide a
practical platform for the electrical control of long-lived valley qubits in
BLG.

modes. Micromagnetic simulations indicate that the edge modes emerge within the
original magnonic band gap and at the intersection between a mini-flatband and
a propagation magnon branch. Our theoretical estimate for the Berry curvature
of the magnon-magnon coupling suggests a non-trivial topology for the chiral
edge modes and confirms the key role played by the dipolar interaction. Our
findings shed light on the topological nature of the magnon edge mode for
emergent moir\'e magnonics.

T5, GPT-3, ChatGPT) have shown a massive improvement and are now capable of
generating human-like long coherent texts at scale, yielding so-called deepfake
texts. This advancement, despite their benefits, can also cause security and
privacy issues (e.g., plagiarism, identity obfuscation, disinformation attack).
As such, it has become critically important to develop effective, practical,
and scalable solutions to differentiate deepfake texts from human-written
texts. Toward this challenge, in this work, we investigate how factors such as
skill levels and collaborations impact how humans identify deepfake texts,
studying three research questions: (1) do collaborative teams detect deepfake
texts better than individuals? (2) do expert humans detect deepfake texts
better than non-expert humans? (3) what are the factors that maximize the
detection performance of humans? We implement these questions on two platforms:
(1) non-expert humans or asynchronous teams on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) and
(2) expert humans or synchronous teams on the Upwork. By analyzing the
detection performance and the factors that affected performance, some of our
key findings are: (1) expert humans detect deepfake texts significantly better
than non-expert humans, (2) synchronous teams on the Upwork detect deepfake
texts significantly better than individuals, while asynchronous teams on the
AMT detect deepfake texts weakly better than individuals, and (3) among various
error categories, examining coherence and consistency in texts is useful in
detecting deepfake texts. In conclusion, our work could inform the design of
future tools/framework to improve collaborative human detection of deepfake
texts.

dissipative spin hydrodynamic equations using the entropy current approach. In
our analysis, we consider a general energy-momentum tensor with symmetric and

conserved, has a simple phenomenological form that is antisymmetric only in the
last two indices. Apart from the evolution equations for energy density, fluid
flow, and spin density, we also find relaxation-type dynamical equations for
various dissipative currents. The latter are consistently derived within the
second-order theory as gradient corrections to the energy-momentum and spin
tensors. We argue that this approach correctly reproduces the corresponding
Navier-Stokes limit of spin hydrodynamic equations. Throughout our analysis,
the spin chemical potential is considered a $\mathcal{O}(\partial)$ quantity in
the hydrodynamic gradient expansion and reduces to thermal vorticity in the
global equilibrium. New coefficients appearing in the generalized spin
hydrodynamic equations are undetermined and can only be evaluated within a
proper underlying microscopic theory of a given system.

the CO luminosity does not correlate with AGN luminosity and Eddington ratio,
while the molecular gas fraction is weakly correlated with Eddington ratio. The
type 1 AGNs can be roughly separated into two populations in terms of
infrared-to-CO luminosity ratio, one population presenting values typically

comparable to those measured for starbursts. We find no evidence that AGN

cannot be explained by a starburst-driven scenario and is therefore likely
dominated by the active galactic nucleus in this galaxy. In addition to the

pressing need, leading to extensive research efforts focused on designing FASTQ
compressors. Previous researches show that lossless compression of quality
values seems to reach its limits. But there remain lots of room for the
compression of the reads part. Results: By investigating the characters of the
sequencing process, we present a new algorithm for compressing reads in FASTQ

reviewed the pipeline of reference-based algorithms and identified three key
components that heavily impact storage: the matching positions of reads on the
reference sequence(refpos), the mismatched positions of bases on reads(mispos)
and the matching failed reads(unmapseq). To reduce their sizes, we conducted a
detailed analysis of the distribution of matching positions and sequencing
errors and then developed the three modules of AMGC. According to the

ejected outwards and heated, forming a cool jet ~ 6000 K and a hot X-ray jet ~

performance in 2D visual perception tasks. However, their performance in
multi-view 3D object detection remains inferior to the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
of convolutional neural network based detectors. In this work, we investigate
this issue from the perspective of bird's-eye-view (BEV) feature generation.
Specifically, we examine the BEV feature generation method employed by the
transformer-based SOTA, BEVFormer, and identify its two limitations: (i) it
only generates attention weights from BEV, which precludes the use of lidar
points for supervision, and (ii) it aggregates camera view features to the BEV
through deformable sampling, which only selects a small subset of features and
fails to exploit all information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
novel BEV feature generation method, dual-view attention, which generates
attention weights from both the BEV and camera view. This method encodes all
camera features into the BEV feature. By combining dual-view attention with the
BEVFormer architecture, we build a new detector named VoxelFormer. Extensive
experiments are conducted on the nuScenes benchmark to verify the superiority
of dual-view attention and VoxelForer. We observe that even only adopting 3
encoders and 1 historical frame during training, VoxelFormer still outperforms
BEVFormer significantly. When trained in the same setting, VoxelFormer can
surpass BEVFormer by 4.9% NDS point. Code is available at:

  The solution of EF is highly efficient: i) the state variables are only the
sensor poses -- trajectory, while the plane parameters are estimated previously
in closed from and ii) EF alternating optimization uses a Newton-Raphson method
by a direct analytical calculation of the gradient and the Hessian, which turns
out to be a block diagonal matrix. Since we require to differentiate over

expressed in terms of wet surface ratios (WSR) over a number of subdomains of

However, the non-Gaussianity of the observation errors associated with

EnKF, thus jeopardizing the optimality of the filter analysis. The novelty of
this paper lies in the treatment of the non-Gaussianity of the SAR-derived WSR
observations with a Gaussian anamorphosis process (GA). This DA strategy was

couple to the cosmic expansion. The mass of these SMBHs increase as the cubic
power of the cosmic scale factor, leaving the energy density of the SMBHs
unchanged when the universe expands. However, following general principles of
general relativity, namely, locality or junction conditions, we show that the
inner part of a gravitationally bounded system is unaware of the cosmic
expansion, since the outer solution can be smoothly replaced by an
asymptotically flat background. For the same reason, the direct reason that we
do not expand with the expansion of the universe is not that we are bound
states, but rather we are positioned in a greater gravitationally bounded
system, namely the local group.

the production of heavier ALPs through the photon coalescence process,
enlarging the mass range of ALPs that could be observed in this way and giving
a stronger bound from the observation of SN 1987A. Furthermore, we present a
new analytical method for calculating the predicted gamma-ray signal from ALP
decays. With this method we can rigorously prove the validity of an
approximation that has been used in some of the previous literature, which we
show here to be valid only if all gamma rays arrive under extremely small
observation angles (i.e. very close to the line of sight to the SN). However,
it also shows where the approximation is not valid, and offers an efficient
alternative to calculate the ALP-induced gamma-ray flux in a general setting
when the observation angles are not guaranteed to be small. We also estimate
the sensitivity of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) to this gamma-ray
signal from a future nearby SN and show that in the case of a non-observation
the current bounds on the ALP-photon coupling $ g_{a\gamma} $ are strengthened
by about an order of magnitude. In the case of an observation, we show that it
may be possible to reconstruct the product $ g_{a\gamma}^2 m_a $, with $ m_a $
the mass of the ALP.

rescaling. Our framework first embeds an HR image into a JPEG LR thumbnail by
an encoder with our proposed quantization prediction module, which minimizes
the file size of the embedding LR JPEG thumbnail while maximizing HR
reconstruction quality. Then, an efficient frequency-aware decoder reconstructs
a high-fidelity HR image from the LR one in real time. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous image rescaling baselines

avenue for semi-autonomous robotic disassembly that addresses these challenges.
However, it is suggested that quality and realism of the user's haptic
interactions with the environment is important for precise, contact-rich and
safety-critical tasks. To investigate this proposition, we demonstrate the
disassembly of a Nissan Leaf 2011 module stack as a basis for a comparative
study between a traditional asymmetric haptic-'cobot' master-slave framework
and identical master and slave cobots based on task completion time and success
rate metrics. We demonstrate across a range of disassembly tasks a time
reduction of 22%-57% is achieved using identical cobots, yet this improvement
arises chiefly from an expanded workspace and 1:1 positional mapping, and
suffers a 10-30% reduction in first attempt success rate. For unbolting and
grasping, the realism of force feedback was comparatively less important than
directional information encoded in the interaction, however, 1:1 force mapping
strengthened environmental tactile cues for vacuum pick-and-place and contact
cutting tasks.

projection. As the projection is not injective, a stabilisation based upon the
complementary projection is added in order to restore well-posedness. Within
the framework of elliptic problems, the discrete problem may be viewed as a
reformulation of a discrete obstacle problem, incorporating the inequality
constraints through Lipschitz projections. The derivation of the proposed
method is exemplified for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion problems.
Near-best approximation results in suitable norms are established. In
particular, we prove that, in the linear case, the numerical solution is the
best approximation in the energy norm among all nodally bound-preserving finite

optimizing the parameters over an additional dataset, we find prediction
regions that are not conservative. We show that this problem can be cast as a

fusion methods mostly focus on concatenating or summing up the output
embeddings, without considering interacting and aligning the embeddings of the
same vertices on different manifolds, which can lead to distortion and
impression in the final fusion results. Besides, it is also challenging to fuse
the embeddings of the same vertices from different coordinate systems. In face
of these challenges, we propose the Fused Manifold Graph Neural Network
(FMGNN), a novel GNN architecture that embeds graphs into different Riemannian
manifolds with interaction and alignment among these manifolds during training
and fuses the vertex embeddings through the distances on different manifolds
between vertices and selected landmarks, geometric coresets. Our experiments
demonstrate that FMGNN yields superior performance over strong baselines on the
benchmarks of node classification and link prediction tasks.

the mechanism(s) for such efficient electron acceleration in solar flare (and
similar astrophysical settings) presents a major challenge. This is due in part
to a lack of observational constraints related to conditions in the primary
acceleration region itself. Accelerated electrons with energies above
$\sim$20~keV are revealed by hard X-ray (HXR) bremsstrahlung emission, while
accelerated electrons with even higher energies manifest themselves through
radio gyrosynchrotron emission. Here we show, for a well-observed flare on
2017~September~10, that a combination of \emph{RHESSI} hard X-ray and and
SDO/AIA EUV observations provides a robust estimate of the fraction of the
ambient electron population that is accelerated at a given time, with an upper
limit of $\sim 10^{-2}$ on the number density of nonthermal ($\ge 20$~keV)
electrons, expressed as a fraction of the number density of ambient protons in
the same volume. This upper limit is about two orders of magnitude lower than
previously inferred from microwave observations of the same event. Our results
strongly indicate that the fraction of accelerated electrons in the coronal
region at any given time is relatively small, but also that the overall
duration of the HXR emission requires a steady resupply of electrons to the
acceleration site. Simultaneous measurements of the instantaneous accelerated
electron number density and the associated specific electron acceleration rate
provide key constraints for a quantitative study of the mechanisms leading to
electron acceleration in magnetic reconnection events.

the layer norm operation and weights in linear layers. In our experiments, RPTQ
achieved a significant breakthrough by utilizing 3-bit activation in LLMs for

column in the natural environment are often subject to the action of surface
gravity waves. By modelling such anisotropic particles as small spheroids that
slowly settle (or rise) in a wavy environment, we consider how the particle
shape and buoyancy couple to the background wave-driven flow to influence the
particle orientation, drift, and dispersion. A multiscale expansion allows the
wave-induced oscillations to be separated from the wave-averaged particle
motion. Using the wave-averaged equations of particle motion, we demonstrate
that spheroidal particles have a wave-induced preferential orientation with
different stable solutions for prolate and oblate particles. The resulting
preferential orientation positions particles with their longest axis pointing
in the direction of wave propagation and upwards against gravity. The angle at
which the longest axis points upwards is a function of particle aspect ratio.
In this orientation, particles drift in the direction opposite to wave
propagation, weakening and potentially even reversing their Stokes drift. The
wave-induced stable orientation also results in a reduced settling velocity
relative to a random (isotropic) orientation. The dispersion of a particle
cloud is controlled by the distribution of orientations. For a cloud of
particles released together with random (isotropic) orientation, the initial
cloud growth rate is ballistic in all directions. Wave action acts to suppress
the vertical dispersion, but enhances horizontal dispersion into a
super-ballistic state when the Stokes drift shear acts on a particle cloud that
has expanded in the vertical direction.

phenomena of dissipation and cumulation of electrical energy (an external
source in continuous media) are discussed, accompanied by the formation of
cumulative-dissipative structures and their ordering into a regular system - a
dynamic dissipative ""crystal"" with a long-range dynamic order. The excitation
of new degrees of freedom in such systems provides attractiveness or geometric
self-focusing of energy-mass-momentum flows (EMMF) for the entire regular
system. As a result of cumulation, EMMF structures acquire hyper-properties.
The cumulation of EMMF in rendered structures is a common property of media
activated to form 4D structures. The basis of such a dissipative structure is
an attractor, the end result of which is a cumulative jet from an attractor
with hyper-properties. Therefore, these structures are cumulative-dissipative.
We discuss a method for describing these structures and prove that cumulative
processes in plasmoids exist and can be described theoretically, although not
with the help of full-fledged mathematical 4D models. It has been theoretically
and experimentally proven that the cumulation of the electric field due to the
ambipolar drift of the plasma is an inherent property of the current carrying
gas-discharge plasma. The results obtained by modeling shock waves of the
electric field (E/N) can be useful to explain the cumulative formation in the
heliosphere, atmosphere and ionosphere of the Earth, since the Earth has a
negative charge of about 500,000 C, and the Sun positively charged at the level
of 1400 C. Based on the mathematical approach, a classification of shock waves
and types of cumulation in 4D space-time will be carried out.

presented a new theory: how Henry's Law regulates the concentration of CO$_2$
in the atmosphere. This theory uses a physically perfect unit impulse response
to convolve signals. By comparing the theory and the present observations we
are able to derive the response time about 7.4 years, which is roughly the
residence time of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere. In addition, according to Henry's
Law we can derive the temperature dependence of the equilibrium concentration
of CO$_2$. It turns out that now the major increase of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere
is due to the temperature change, the reason for which is approximately a
change of cloudiness ($90\%$) and the rest ($10\%$) the greenhouse effect. The
corresponding increase of CO$_2$ is $83$~ppm/$^\circ$C. According to our
theory, the causality is very clear: the increase of the temperature results in
more CO$_2$ in the atmosphere. This further CO$_2$ concentration increases also
the temperature but less than $10\%$ via the greenhouse effect. The human
contribution to the CO$_2$ concentration and the temperature is very small.
About $90\%$ of a big human release of CO$_2$ dissolves in water. That is why
the human release now warms the climate less than $0.03 ^\circ$C. We can also
perform an inverse operation or calculate the temperature profile from the
observed CO$_2$ curve. So we propose a new thermometer for the global surface
temperature. This can be used almost in real time and it is more accurate than
the present methods. It turns out that probably also N$_2$O and SF$_6$
concentrations in the atmosphere operate as global thermometers.

system that can be induced by controlling the interaction between resonant
photonic modes. EPs can enable unusual optical phenomena and significantly
enhance the optical sensitivity under small perturbations. However, most
studies thus far have been limited to static photonic structures. In this
study, we propose and experimentally demonstrate electrically addressable EP in
a plasmonic structure. Inspired by optical microcavity studies, we employ a
localized spoof plasmon structure that supports circulating plasmonic modes in
a compact single-resonator geometry. The plasmonic modes are perturbed by an
angled metal line, and the interaction between the plasmonic modes is
electrically controlled using a varactor. Continuous electrical tuning of the
varactor capacitance facilitates simultaneous coalescence of the real and
imaginary parts of the eigenfrequency, allowing the direct addressing of EPs.
We first investigate the eigenmodes and their coupling in localized plasmonic
structures using numerical simulations. We then present experimentally measured
spectra that manifest the coalescence of the two resonant modes in both the
resonance frequency and linewidth. Electrically addressable EPs in compact
plasmonic structures may provide exciting opportunities for highly functional

for transparent and comprehensible explanations of their decision-making.
However, most explanation methods that have been developed so far are not
intuitively understandable for lay users. In contrast, natural language
explanations (NLEs) promise to enable the communication of a model's
decision-making in an easily intelligible way. While current models
successfully generate convincing explanations, it is an open question how well
the NLEs actually represent the reasoning process of the models - a property
called faithfulness. Although the development of metrics to measure
faithfulness is crucial to designing more faithful models, current metrics are
either not applicable to NLEs or are not designed to compare different model
architectures across multiple modalities.
  Building on prior research on faithfulness measures and based on a detailed
rationale, we address this issue by proposing three faithfulness metrics:
Attribution-Similarity, NLE-Sufficiency, and NLE-Comprehensiveness. The
efficacy of the metrics is evaluated on the VQA-X and e-SNLI-VE datasets of the
e-ViL benchmark for vision-language NLE generation by systematically applying
modifications to the performant e-UG model for which we expect changes in the
measured explanation faithfulness. We show on the e-SNLI-VE dataset that the
removal of redundant inputs to the explanation-generation module of e-UG
successively increases the model's faithfulness on the linguistic modality as
measured by Attribution-Similarity. Further, our analysis demonstrates that
NLE-Sufficiency and -Comprehensiveness are not necessarily correlated to
Attribution-Similarity, and we discuss how the two metrics can be utilized to
gain further insights into the explanation generation process.

a thin layer of metal acting as electrodes. This system bends when it is
subject to an electric field orthogonal to the film and can thus be used as an
actuator. Conversely, the deflection of the film generates a potential
difference between the electrodes ; the same system can therefore be used as a
sensor.We have developed a ''continuous medium'' model for this system. The
thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes had enabled us to establish its
constitutive equations.We are currently interested in a system of close
properties based on PEDOT, a semiconductor EAP. The central part of the device
consists in two interpenetrating polymers playing the role of an ions
reservoir. The PEDOT is polymerized on each side and forms an interpenetrating
network with the two other polymers. A pseudo trilayer is obtained, the two
outer layers containing the PEDOT acting as electrodes. It is then saturated
with an ionic liquid. When the blade thus obtained is placed in an electric
field orthogonal to its faces, the PEDOT undergoes a reduction reaction (or
dedoping) on the side of the negative electrode, which attracts cations from
the central part and therefore swells ; the blade ultimately bends towards the
positive electrode.We have first adapted our model to this two-components
system : the cations on the one hand, and the three polymers and the anions on
the other hand. We have written its balance equations and thermodynamic
relations first at the microscopic scale for each phase, then at the
macroscopic scale for the whole material using an averaging technique. The
thermodynamics of linear irreversible processes then provides its constitutive
relations : a Kelvin - Voigt type stress-strain relation and generalized
Fourier's and Darcy's laws. The equations obtained were applied to the case of
a cantilevered blade subject to a continuous potential difference at constant
temperature. The numerical resolution of the equations system enabled us to
draw the profiles of the different quantities, which are very steep functions

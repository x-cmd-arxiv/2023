major challenge for automated driving systems. Different from the detection of
ordinary objects with pre-definable classes, detecting unexpected obstacles on
the road cannot be resolved by upscaling the sensor technology alone (e.g.,
high resolution video imagers / radar antennas, denser LiDAR scan lines). This
is due to the fact, that there is a wide variety in the types of unexpected
obstacles that also do not share a common appearance (e.g., lost cargo as a
suitcase or bicycle, tire fragments, a tree stem). Also adding object classes
or adding \enquote{all} of these objects to a common \enquote{unexpected
obstacle} class does not scale. In this contribution, we study the feasibility
of using a deep learning video-based lane corridor (called \enquote{AI
ego-corridor}) to ease the challenge by inverting the problem: Instead of
detecting a previously unseen object, the AI ego-corridor detects that the
ego-lane ahead ends. A smart ground-truth definition enables an easy
feature-based classification of an abrupt end of the ego-lane. We propose two
neural network designs and research among other things the potential of
training with synthetic data. We evaluate our approach on a test vehicle
platform. It is shown that the approach is able to detect numerous previously
unseen obstacles at a distance of up to 300 m with a detection rate of 95 %.

To solve the problem, we construct a corresponding to the process sequence of

increment sequence, we obtain formulas for calculating values of the mean
square errors and the spectral characteristics of the optimal estimates of the

the minimax (robust) spectral characteristics of the optimal linear estimates
of functionals are derived in the case where the sets of admissible spectral

topological errors like overlapping regions, disrupted connections, and voids.
To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel loss function, namely
Topology-Aware Focal Loss (TAFL), that incorporates the conventional Focal Loss
with a topological constraint term based on the Wasserstein distance between
the ground truth and predicted segmentation masks' persistence diagrams. By
enforcing identical topology as the ground truth, the topological constraint
can effectively resolve topological errors, while Focal Loss tackles class
imbalance. We begin by constructing persistence diagrams from filtered cubical
complexes of the ground truth and predicted segmentation masks. We subsequently
utilize the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm to determine the optimal transport plan
between the two persistence diagrams. The resultant transport plan minimizes
the cost of transporting mass from one distribution to the other and provides a
mapping between the points in the two persistence diagrams. We then compute the
Wasserstein distance based on this travel plan to measure the topological
dissimilarity between the ground truth and predicted masks. We evaluate our
approach by training a 3D U-Net with the MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation
(BraTS) challenge validation dataset, which requires accurate segmentation of
3D MRI scans that integrate various modalities for the precise identification
and tracking of malignant brain tumors. Then, we demonstrate that the quality
of segmentation performance is enhanced by regularizing the focal loss through
the addition of a topological constraint as a penalty term.

  note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2105.09111",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) as an emerging technique have
shown superior capacity of dealing with heterogeneous information network
(HIN). However, most HGNNs follow a semi-supervised learning manner, which
notably limits their wide use in reality since labels are usually scarce in
real applications. Recently, contrastive learning, a self-supervised method,
becomes one of the most exciting learning paradigms and shows great potential
when there are no labels. In this paper, we study the problem of
self-supervised HGNNs and propose a novel co-contrastive learning mechanism for
HGNNs, named HeCo. Different from traditional contrastive learning which only
focuses on contrasting positive and negative samples, HeCo employs cross-view
contrastive mechanism. Specifically, two views of a HIN (network schema and
meta-path views) are proposed to learn node embeddings, so as to capture both
of local and high-order structures simultaneously. Then the cross-view
contrastive learning, as well as a view mask mechanism, is proposed, which is
able to extract the positive and negative embeddings from two views. This
enables the two views to collaboratively supervise each other and finally learn
high-level node embeddings. Moreover, to further boost the performance of HeCo,
two additional methods are designed to generate harder negative samples with
high quality. Besides the invariant factors, view-specific factors
complementally provide the diverse structure information between different
nodes, which also should be contained into the final embeddings. Therefore, we
need to further explore each view independently and propose a modified model,
called HeCo++. Specifically, HeCo++ conducts hierarchical contrastive learning,
including cross-view and intra-view contrasts, which aims to enhance the mining
of respective structures.

utilize the multi-crop views to generate the negatives via the center-crop and
the random-crop, which can improve the diversity of negatives and meanwhile
increase the quality of negatives. To constrain the embedings in the deep

encourages the generated images to be close to the real images in the embedding

are obtained at lower neutrino energies and are subject to different sources of

computationally efficient and able to group series generated from similar

extensive simulation study shows that the proposed methods outperform several

Leveraging the Faddeev-Jackiw method, we identify and classify all

exotic phases: (i) the stripe-rung ferromagnet (SRFM), (ii) the anisotropic
anti-ferromagnet (AAFM), (iii) the Dimer, and (iv) the stripe-leg ferromagnet
(SLFM) in absence of any external magnetic field. In this work, the effect of
externally applied longitudinal and transverse fields on quantum phases are
studied. In both cases, we show that there exist two plateau phases at $1/4$,
and $1/2$ of the saturation of magnetization. Due to the strong rung dimer
formation, the system opens a finite spin gap for all the phases resulting in
zero magnetization plateau in presence of a longitudinal field. The mechanism
of plateau formation is analyzed using spin density, quantum fidelity, and
quantum concurrence. In the (i) SRFM phase, Ising exchanges are dominant for
all spins but the Heisenberg rungs are weak, and therefore, the magnetization
shows a continuous transition as a function of transverse field. In the other
three phases [(ii)-(iv)], Ising dimer rungs are weak and broken first to reach
the plateau at $1/2$ of the saturation magnetization, having a large gap, which
is closed by further application of the field. We use the exact diagonalization
(ED) and the transfer matrix method (TM) to solve the Hamiltonian.

two common forms of additional contextual information that often help
developers understand code better. For the experiments, we study code
completion in two granularity levels; token and line completion and take three
recent and large-scale language models for source code: UniXcoder, CodeGPT, and
InCoder with five evaluation metrics. Finally, we perform the Wilcoxon Signed
Rank test to gauge significance and measure the effect size. Contrary to our
expectations, all models perform better if type annotations are removed (albeit
the effect sizes are small). For comments, we find that the models perform
better in the presence of multi-line comments (again with small effect sizes).
Based on our observations, we recommend making proper design choices when
training, fine-tuning, or simply selecting such models given the intended data

further investigated to improve the practicality and accuracy of

orthogonal: the former needs edges to be assigned colors immediately after
insertion, typically without any space restrictions, while the latter limits
memory to sublinear in the input size but allows an edge's color to be
announced any time after its insertion. We aim for the best of both worlds by
designing small-space online algorithms for edge coloring. We study the problem
under both (adversarial) edge arrivals and vertex arrivals. Our results
significantly improve upon the memory used by prior online algorithms while
achieving an $O(1)$-competitive ratio. In particular, for $n$-node graphs with
maximum vertex-degree $\Delta$ under edge arrivals, we obtain an online
$O(\Delta)$-coloring in $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{\Delta})$ space. This is also the
first W-streaming edge-coloring algorithm using $O(\Delta)$ colors (in
sublinear memory). All prior works either used linear memory or
$\omega(\Delta)$ colors. We also achieve a smooth color-space tradeoff: for any
$t=O(\Delta)$, we get an $O(\Delta t (\log^2 \Delta))$-coloring in
$\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{\Delta/t})$ space, improving upon the state of the art that
used $\tilde{O}(n\Delta/t)$ space for the same number of colors (the
$\tilde{O}(.)$ notation hides polylog$(n)$ factors). The improvements stem from
extensive use of random permutations that enable us to avoid previously used

fallback of the SN ejecta. We study the impact of these updates by performing
$N$-body simulations following instantaneous gas expulsion. For comparison, we
simulate two additional model sets with the previous treatment of stars: one
with high kicks and another with artificial removal of the kicks. Our model
clusters initially consist of about one hundred thousand stars, formed with
centrally-peaked efficiency. We find that the updated treatment of stars, due
to the fallback-scaled lower natal kicks, allows clusters to retain SN remnants
after violent relaxation. The mass contribution of the retained remnants does
not exceed a few percent of the total bound cluster mass during the early
evolution. For this reason, the first giga year of evolution is not affected
significantly by this effect. Nevertheless, during the subsequent long-term
evolution, the retained BHs accelerate mass segregation, leading to the faster
dissolution of the clusters.

for a specific optimum spinning reserve power for a particular power grid.
Using this optimization framework, we also determine the total dispatchable

constraints, this paper evaluates several factors: availability,
dispatchability, non-dispatchability, spinning reserve, and arbitrage factor.
These factors are used as constraints in this LP optimization to determine the
total optimal reserve power from the existing DERs. The proposed optimization
framework maximizes the ratio of dispatchable to non-dispatchable power to
minimize unit commitment problems within a specific range of spinning reserve

layers has led to the exciting field of twistronics. However, practical
applications of such systems are challenging since the specific angular
correlations between the layers must be precisely controlled and the layers
have to be single crystalline with uniform atomic ordering. Here, we suggest an
alternative, simple and scalable approach where nanocrystalline two-dimensional
(2D) film on three-dimensional (3D) substrates yield
twisted-interface-dependent properties. Ultrawide-bandgap hexagonal boron
nitride (h-BN) thin films are directly grown on high in-plane lattice
mismatched wide-bandgap silicon carbide (4H-SiC) substrates to explore the
twist-dependent structure-property correlations. Concurrently, nanocrystalline
h-BN thin film shows strong non-linear second-harmonic generation and ultra-low
cross-plane thermal conductivity at room temperature, which are attributed to
the twisted domain edges between van der Waals stacked nanocrystals with random
in-plane orientations. First-principles calculations based on time-dependent
density functional theory manifest strong even-order optical nonlinearity in
twisted h-BN layers. Our work unveils that directly deposited 2D
nanocrystalline thin film on 3D substrates could provide easily accessible
twist-interfaces, therefore enabling a simple and scalable approach to utilize

systems with limited labels. While recognition models improve with model size
and amount of data, many specialized applications of computer vision have
severe resource constraints both during training and inference. Transfer
learning is an effective solution for training with few labels, however often
at the expense of a computationally costly fine-tuning of large base models. We
propose to mitigate this unpleasant trade-off between compute and accuracy via
semi-supervised cross-domain distillation from a set of diverse source models.
Initially, we show how to use task similarity metrics to select a single
suitable source model to distill from, and that a good selection process is
imperative for good downstream performance of a target model. We dub this
approach DistillNearest. Though effective, DistillNearest assumes a single
source model matches the target task, which is not always the case. To
alleviate this, we propose a weighted multi-source distillation method to
distill multiple source models trained on different domains weighted by their
relevance for the target task into a single efficient model (named
DistillWeighted). Our methods need no access to source data, and merely need
features and pseudo-labels of the source models. When the goal is accurate
recognition under computational constraints, both DistillNearest and
DistillWeighted approaches outperform both transfer learning from strong
ImageNet initializations as well as state-of-the-art semi-supervised techniques
such as FixMatch. Averaged over 8 diverse target tasks our multi-source method
outperforms the baselines by 5.6%-points and 4.5%-points, respectively.

that the emission of a non-standard second neutrino burst, dominated by

deconfined quark matter but also reveals information about the state of matter
at extreme conditions encountered at the supernova interior. To this end, a
large set of spherically symmetric supernova models is investigated, studying
the dependence on the equation of state and on the stellar progenitor. General
relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics is employed featuring
three-flavor Boltzmann neutrino transport and a microscopic hadron-quark hybrid
matter equation of state class, that covers a representative range of

of the neutrino signal and properties of the equation of state. In particular,
a set of novel relations have been found empirically. These potentially provide

Building such a system requires reconstructing the root-body and articulated

likely to contain larger motions (which complicates reconstruction). To address
these challenges, we present Total-Recon, the first method to

predictions of current micro-physical models of CR transport in
magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence are drastically different from what is
observed. These models of transport usually focus on MHD turbulence in the
presence of a strong guide field and ignore the impact of turbulent
intermittency on particle propagation. This motivates our studying the
alternative regime of large-amplitude turbulence with $\delta B/B_0 \gg 1$, in
which intermittent small-scale magnetic field reversals are ubiquitous. We
study particle transport in such turbulence by integrating trajectories in
stationary snapshots. To quantify spatial diffusion, we use a setup with
continuous particle injection and escape, which we term the turbulent leaky
box. We find that particle transport is very different from the
strong-guide-field case. Low-energy particles are better confined than
high-energy particles, despite less efficient pitch-angle diffusion at small
energies. In the limit of weak guide field, energy-dependent confinement is
driven by the energy-dependent (in)ability to follow reversing magnetic field
lines exactly and by the scattering in regions of ``resonant curvature"", where
the field line bends on a scale that is of order the local particle
gyro-radius. We derive a heuristic model of particle transport in magnetic
folds that approximately reproduces the energy dependence of transport found in
the leaky-box experiments. We speculate that CR propagation in the Galaxy is
regulated by the intermittent field reversals highlighted here and discuss the
implications of our findings for the transport of CRs in the Milky Way.

a fast-rolling scalar field. Dark matter that is thermally produced during an
era of kination requires larger-than-canonical annihilation cross sections to
generate the observed dark matter relic abundance. Furthermore, dark matter
density perturbations that enter the horizon during an era of kination grow
linearly with the scale factor prior to radiation domination. We show how the
resulting enhancement to the small-scale matter power spectrum increases the
microhalo abundance and boosts the dark matter annihilation rate. We then use
gamma-ray observations to constrain thermal dark matter production during
kination. The annihilation boost factor depends on the minimum halo mass, which
is determined by the small-scale cutoff in the matter power spectrum.
Therefore, observational limits on the dark matter annihilation rate imply a
minimum cutoff scale for a given dark matter particle mass and kination
scenario. For dark matter that was once in thermal equilibrium with the
Standard Model, this constraint establishes a maximum allowed kinetic
decoupling temperature for the dark matter. This bound on the decoupling
temperature implies that the growth of perturbations during kination cannot
appreciably boost the dark matter annihilation rate if dark matter was once in
thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model.

analytical model to analyse the collisional evolution of solids in debris
discs, focusing on their joint radial and temporal dependence. Consistent with
previous models, we find that as the largest planetesimals reach collisional
equilibrium in the inner regions, the surface density of dust and solids
becomes proportional to $\sim r^{2}$ within a certain critical radius. We
present simple equations to estimate the critical radius and surface density of
dust as a function of the maximum planetesimal size and initial surface density
in solids (and vice versa). We apply this model to ALMA observations of 7 wide
debris discs. We use both parametric and non-parametric modelling to test if
their inner edges are shallow and consistent with collisional evolution. We
find that 4 out of 7 have inner edges consistent with collisional evolution.
Three of these would require small maximum planetesimal sizes below 10 km, with
HR 8799's disc potentially lacking solids larger than a few centimeters. The
remaining systems have inner edges that are much sharper, which requires
maximum planetesimal sizes $\gtrsim10$ km. Their sharp inner edges suggest they

highly uncertain component of galaxy evolution models. In this paper, we extend
the $z\sim0.7$ MZR by $\sim$0.5 dex up to
log$(M_\star/\textrm{M}_\odot)\sim11.1$. We use extremely deep VLT VIMOS
spectra from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) survey to
measure metallicities for 145 galaxies. The LEGA-C MZR matches the
normalization of the $z\sim0.8$ DEEP2 MZR where they overlap, so we combine the
two to create an MZR spanning from 9.3 to 11.1 log$(M_\star/\textrm{M}_\odot)$.
The LEGA-C+DEEP2 MZR at $z\sim0.7$ is offset to slightly lower metallicities
(0.05-0.13 dex) than the $z\sim0$ MZR, but it otherwise mirrors the established
power law rise at low/intermediate stellar masses and asymptotic flattening at
high stellar masses. We compare the LEGA-C+DEEP2 MZR to the MZR from two
cosmological simulations (IllustrisTNG and SIMBA), which predict qualitatively
different metallicity trends for high-mass galaxies. This comparison highlights
that our extended MZR provides a crucial observational constraint for galaxy

(2023) reported the serendipitous discovery of a thin
linear object interpreted as the trail of star-forming regions left behind by a
runaway supermassive black hole (SMBH) kicked out from the center of a galaxy.
Despite the undeniable interest in the idea, the actual physical interpretation
is not devoid of difficulty. The wake of a SMBH produces only small
perturbations on the external medium, which has to be in exceptional physical
conditions to collapse gravitationally and form a long (40 kpc) massive (3e9
Msun) stellar trace in only 39 Myr. Here we offer a more conventional
explanation: the stellar trail is a bulgeless galaxy viewed edge-on. This
interpretation is supported by the fact that its position--velocity curve
resembles a rotation curve which, together with its stellar mass, puts the
object right on top of the Tully-Fisher relation characteristic of disk
galaxies. Moreover, the rotation curve (Vmax sim 110 km/s), stellar mass,
extension, width (z0 sim 1.2 kpc), and surface brightness profile of the object
are very much like those of IC5249, a well-known local bulgeless edge-on
galaxy. These observational facts are difficult to interpret within the SMBH
wake scenario. We discuss in detail the pros and cons of the two options.

Interpretable machine-learning approaches for separating eclipsing binaries

Long-duration GRBs (with $T_{90} > 2s$) have traditionally been thought to be

(with $T_{90} < 2s$) from compact binary mergers. However, recent observations
of a long GRB associated with a kilonova (KN) and a short GRB with supernova

In this {\it Letter}, we focus on GRBs associated with KNe, believed to be
originating from mergers of binaries involving neutron stars (NS). We make use
of the GRB prompt emission light curves of {\it Swift}-BAT 2022 GRB catalog and
employ machine learning algorithms to study the classification of GRB

these clusters may be due to subclasses of binary neutron star (BNS) and/or

and light curves of SN2020udy are in good agreement with those of the 'N5def'
deflagration model of a near Chandrasekhar-mass carbon-oxygen white dwarf.
However, as has been seen in previous studies of similar luminosity events, SN
2020udy evolves slower than the model. Broad-band linear polarisation
measurements taken at and after peak are consistent with no polarisation, in
agreement with the predictions of the companion-star configuration from the
early light curve measurements. The host galaxy environment is low metallicity
and is consistent with a young stellar population. Overall, we find the most
plausible explosion scenario to be the incomplete disruption of a CO white
dwarf near the Chandrasekhar-mass limit, with a helium-star companion.

Type IIn supernova SN2017hcc, covering 16 to 391 days after explosion. In our
first epoch we measure continuum polarization as high as 6%, making SN 2017hcc
the most intrinsically polarized SN ever reported. During the first 29 days of
coverage, when the polarization is strongest, the continuum polarization has a
wavelength dependence that rises toward blue wavelengths, and becomes
wavelength independent by day 45. The polarization strength drops rapidly
during the first month, even as the SN flux is still climbing to peak
brightness. Nonetheless, record-high polarization is maintained until day 68,
at which point the source polarization declines to 1.9%, comparable to peak
levels in previous well-studied SNe IIn. Thereafter the SN continues in
polarization decline, while exhibiting only minor changes in position angle on
the sky. The blue slope of the polarized continuum during the first month,
accompanied by short-lived polarized flux for Balmer emission, suggests that an
aspherical distribution of dust grains in pre-shock circumstellar material
(CSM) is echoing the SN IIn spectrum and strongly influencing the polarization,
while the subsequent decline during the wavelength-independent phase appears
broadly consistent with electron scattering near the SN/CSM interface. The
persistence of the polarization position angle between these two phases
suggests that the pre-existing CSM responsible for the dust scattering at early
times is part of the same geometric structure as the electron-scattering region
that dominates the polarization at later times. SN2017hcc appears to be yet
another, but much more extreme, case of aspherical yet well-ordered CSM in Type
IIn SNe, possibly resulting from pre-SN mass loss shaped by a binary progenitor
system.

promising way of driving accretion in protoplanetary discs. Aims. We
investigate the evolution of large protoplanetary disc populations under the
influence of magnetically driven disc winds as well as internal and external
photoevaporation. We aim to constrain magnetic disc wind models through
comparisons with observations. Methods. We ran 1D vertically integrated
evolutionary simulations for low-viscosity discs, including magnetic braking
and various outflows. The initial conditions were varied and chosen to produce
populations that are representative of actual disc populations inferred from
observations. We then compared the observables from the simulations (e.g.
stellar accretion rate, disc mass evolution, disc lifetime, etc.) with
observational data. Results. Our simulations show that to reach stellar
accretion rates comparable to those found by observations $\sim
10^{-8}\mathrm{M}_\odot / \mathrm{yr}$, it is necessary to have access not only
to strong magnetic torques, but weak magnetic winds as well. The presence of a
strong magnetic disc wind, in combination with internal photoevaporation, leads
to the rapid opening of an inner cavity early on, allowing the stellar
accretion rate to drop while the disc is still massive. Furthermore, our model
supports the notion that external photoevaporation via the ambient
far-ultraviolet radiation of surrounding stars is a driving force in disc
evolution and could potentially exert a strong influence on planetary
formation. Conclusions. Our disc population syntheses show that for a subset of
magnetohydrodynamic wind models (weak disc wind, strong torque), it is possible
to reproduce important statistical observational constraints. The magnetic disc
wind paradigm thus represents a novel and appealing alternative to the
classical $\alpha$-viscosity scenario.

(Proportional - Integral - Derivative) control loop factors for modifying
response thresholds in a decentralized, non-communicating, threshold-based
swarm. Each agent in our swarm has a set of four thresholds, each corresponding
to a task the agent is capable of performing. The agent will act on a
particular task if the stimulus is higher than its corresponding threshold. The
ability to modify their thresholds allows the agents to specialize dynamically
in response to task demands. Current approaches to dynamic thresholds typically
use a learning and forgetting process to adjust thresholds. These methods are
able to effectively specialize once, but can have difficulty re-specializing if
the task demands change. Our approach, inspired by the PID control loop, alters
the threshold values based on the current task demand value, the change in task
demand, and the cumulative sum of previous task demands. We show that our
PID-inspired method is scalable and outperforms fixed and current learning and
forgetting response thresholds with non-changing, constant, and abrupt changes
in task demand. This superior performance is due to the ability of our method
to re-specialize repeatedly in response to changing task demands.

revolution driven mainly by the popularization of 3D-printing techniques, which
has enabled the implementation of modern microwave and photonic devices with
advanced functionalities. However, the analysis of 3D metamaterials is complex
and computationally costly in comparison to their 1D and 2D counterparts due to
the intricate geometries involved. In this paper, we present a fully-analytical
framework based on Floquet-Bloch modal expansions of the electromagnetic fields
and integral-equation methods for the analysis of 3D metamaterials and
metagratings. Concretely, we focus on 3D configurations formed by periodic
arrangements of rectangular waveguides with longitudinal slot insertions. The
analytical framework is computationally efficient compared to full-wave
solutions and also works under oblique incidence conditions. Furthermore, it
comes associated with an equivalent circuit that allows to gain physical
insight into the scattering and diffraction phenomena. The analytical
equivalent circuit is tested against full-wave simulations in commercial
software CST. Simulation results show that the proposed 3D structures provide
independent polarization control of the two orthogonal polarizations states.
This key property is of potential interest for the production of full-metal
polarizers, such as the one illustrated.

number of iterations that is independent of the mesh size and polynomial

algebraic multigrid methods. High-performance GPU-accelerated algorithms for

tracing with global illumination. Unlike existing work that focuses on
converting point clouds to other representations--e.g., surfaces or implicit

we train a set transformer that, given a small number of local neighbor points

material blending weights, which are used to render the outcome of this light

achieves higher estimation accuracy than state-of-the-art surface

assigns a dose to each cohort of patients based on accumulating data on
dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) events. In making a dose transition decision, a
key scientific question is whether the true DLT rate of the current dose
exceeds the target DLT rate, and the statistical question is how to evaluate
the statistical evidence in the available DLT data with respect to that
scientific question. In this article, I propose to use generalized likelihood
ratios (GLRs) to measure statistical evidence and support dose transition
decisions. This leads to a GLR-based interval design with three parameters: the
target DLT rate and two GLR cut-points representing the levels of evidence
required for dose escalation and de-escalation. The GLR-based design gives a
likelihood interpretation to each existing interval design and provides a
unified framework for comparing different interval designs in terms of how much
evidence is required for escalation and de-escalation. A GLR-based comparison
of four popular interval designs reveals that the BOIN and TEQR designs require
similar amounts of evidence for escalation and de-escalation, while the mTPI
and i3+3 designs require more evidence for de-escalation than for escalation.
Simulation results demonstrate that the last two designs tend to produce higher
proportions of over-treated patients than the first two. These observations
motivate the consideration of GLR-based designs that require more evidence for
escalation than for de-escalation. Such designs are shown to reduce the
proportion of over-treated patients while maintaining the same accuracy of dose
selection, as compared to the four popular interval designs.

saturation momentum, and is well separated in pseudo-rapidity from the hard
dijets. The emission of the semi-hard jet allows for strong scattering, thus
avoiding the ""higher-twist"" suppression of the exclusive dijet production due
to colour transparency. We compute the trijet cross-section using the

  Systems via Sums-of-Squares Optimization","Under review",,,,"cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present a method for synthesizing dynamic, reduced-order output-feedback
polynomial control policies for control-affine nonlinear systems which
guarantees runtime stability to a goal state, when using visual observations
and a learned perception module in the feedback control loop. We leverage
Lyapunov analysis to formulate the problem of synthesizing such policies. This
problem is nonconvex in the policy parameters and the Lyapunov function that is
used to prove the stability of the policy. To solve this problem approximately,
we propose two approaches: the first solves a sequence of sum-of-squares
optimization problems to iteratively improve a policy which is provably-stable
by construction, while the second directly performs gradient-based optimization
on the parameters of the polynomial policy, and its closed-loop stability is
verified a posteriori. We extend our approach to provide stability guarantees
in the presence of observation noise, which realistically arises due to errors
in the learned perception module. We evaluate our approach on several
underactuated nonlinear systems, including pendula and quadrotors, showing that
our guarantees translate to empirical stability when controlling these systems
from images, while baseline approaches can fail to reliably stabilize the
system.

are very uniform, e.g., large patches of blue sky, while other areas are
scattered with many small objects. Yet, the commonly used successive grid
downsampling strategy in convolutional deep networks treats all areas equally.
Hence, small objects are represented in very few spatial locations, leading to
worse results in tasks such as segmentation. Intuitively, retaining more pixels
representing small objects during downsampling helps to preserve important
information. To achieve this, we propose AutoFocusFormer (AFF), a
local-attention transformer image recognition backbone, which performs adaptive
downsampling by learning to retain the most important pixels for the task.
Since adaptive downsampling generates a set of pixels irregularly distributed
on the image plane, we abandon the classic grid structure. Instead, we develop
a novel point-based local attention block, facilitated by a balanced clustering
module and a learnable neighborhood merging module, which yields
representations for our point-based versions of state-of-the-art segmentation
heads. Experiments show that our AutoFocusFormer (AFF) improves significantly

idealization are two appealing theoretical strategies that have been separately
studied as alternatives to solve some problems rooted in the $\Lambda$CDM

cosmological setting and investigate their cosmological implications, paying
particular attention in the interplay between these two constituents in
different cosmological periods. Specifically, we consider a well-studied
running vacuum model inspired by renormalization group, and a recently proposed
general parameterization for the bulk viscosity $\xi$. By employing dynamical
system analysis, we explore the physical aspects of the new phase space that
emerges from the combined models and derive stability conditions that ensure
complete cosmological dynamics. We identify four distinct classes of models and
find that the critical points of the phase space are non-trivially renewed
compared to the single scenarios. We then proceed, in a joint and complementary
way to the dynamical system analysis, with a detailed numerical exploration to
quantify the impact of both the running parameter and the bulk viscosity
coefficient on the cosmological evolution. Thus, for some values of the model
parameters, numerical solutions show qualitative differences from the
$\Lambda$CDM model, which is phenomenologically appealing in light of

Agents (AICAs), and briefly explains the importance of this field and the
motivation for its emergence. AICA is a software agent that resides on a
system, and is responsible for defending the system from cyber compromises and
enabling the response and recovery of the system, usually autonomously. The
autonomy of the agent is a necessity because of the growing scarcity of human
cyber-experts who could defend systems, either remotely or onsite, and because
sophisticated malware could degrade or spoof the communications of a system
that uses a remote monitoring center. An AICA Reference Architecture has been
proposed and defines five main functions: (1) sensing and world state
identification, (2) planning and action selection, (3) collaboration and
negotiation, (4) action execution and (5) learning and knowledge improvement.
The chapter reviews the details of AICA's environment, functions and
operations. As AICA is intended to make changes within its environment, there
is a risk that an agent's action could harm a friendly computer. This risk must
be balanced against the losses that could occur if the agent does not act. The
chapter discusses means by which this risk can be managed and how AICA's design
features could help build trust among its users.

two-level, non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we observe temporal correlation values up
to 1.703(4) for the Leggett-Garg parameter $K_3$, clearly exceeding the
hitherto inviolable L\""{u}der's bound of 1.5. These excesses occur across the

the sample efficiency and convergence behavior of different optimization

laser heating and insensitivity below the surface prevent their application to
encapsulated low-dimensional electron systems at millikelvin temperatures, home
to numerous intriguing electronic phases. Here, we introduce time, momentum,
and energy resolved pump-probe tunneling spectroscopy (Tr-MERTS). The method
allows the injection of electrons at particular energies and observation of
their subsequent decay in energy-momentum space. Using Tr-MERTS, we visualize
electronic decay processes in Landau levels with lifetimes up to tens of
microseconds. Although most observed features agree with simple
energy-relaxation, we discover an unexpected splitting in the nonequilibrium
energy spectrum in the vicinity of a ferromagnetic state. An exact
diagonalization study of the system suggests that the splitting arises from a
maximally spin-polarized higher energy state, distinct from a conventional
equilibrium skyrmion. Furthermore, we observe time-dependent relaxation of the
splitting, which we attribute to single-flipped spins forming topological spin
textures. These results establish Tr-MERTS as a powerful tool for studying the
dynamics and properties of a two-dimensional electronic system beyond

recently made huge progress in terms of speed and quality, thanks to the advent

new line of methods recently emerged trying to harness diffusion models,

have two major drawbacks. First, rather than commonly used 3D meshes, they
instead generate neural radiance fields (NeRFs), making them impractical for
most real applications. Second, these approaches tend to produce over-saturated
models, giving the output a cartoonish looking effect. Therefore, in this work
we propose a novel method for generation of highly realistic-looking 3D meshes.

is a function that maps each typable lambda-term to an element of a

creates a ""wrapper"" containing a copy of the argument that cannot be erased and
cannot interact with the context in any other way. Both measures rely crucially
on the observation, known to Turing and Prawitz, that contracting a redex
cannot create redexes of higher degree, where the degree of a redex is defined
as the height of the type of its lambda-abstraction. The W-measure maps each
lambda-term to a natural number, and it is obtained by evaluating the term in

maps each lambda-term to a structure of nested multisets, where the nesting

Pulmonary hypertension. The estimated 5-year survival rate from the time of
diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is only 57% without therapy and patients
with right heart failure only survive for approximately 1 year without
treatment (Benza et al., 2012). Given the indolent nature of the disease, early
detection of PH remains a challenge leading to delays in therapy.
Echocardiography is currently used as a screening tool for diagnosing PH.
However, electrocardiography (ECG), a more accessible, simple to use, and
cost-effective tool compared to echocardiography, is less studied and explored
for screening at-risk patients for PH. The goal of this project is to create a
neural network model which can process an ECG signal and detect the presence of

  Probabilistic Agent Dropout","22 pages, 4 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.AI cs.LG cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This work studies a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP) that can
undergo agent dropout and the computation of policies for the post-dropout
system based on control and sampling of the pre-dropout system. The
controller's objective is to find an optimal policy that maximizes the value of
the expected system given a priori knowledge of the agents' dropout
probabilities. Finding an optimal policy for any specific dropout realization
is a special case of this problem. For MDPs with a certain transition
independence and reward separability structure, we assume that removing agents
from the system forms a new MDP comprised of the remaining agents with new
state and action spaces, transition dynamics that marginalize the removed
agents, and rewards that are independent of the removed agents. We first show
that under these assumptions, the value of the expected post-dropout system can
be represented by a single MDP; this ""robust MDP"" eliminates the need to
evaluate all $2^N$ realizations of the system, where $N$ denotes the number of
agents. More significantly, in a model-free context, it is shown that the
robust MDP value can be estimated with samples generated by the pre-dropout
system, meaning that robust policies can be found before dropout occurs. This
fact is used to propose a policy importance sampling (IS) routine that performs
policy evaluation for dropout scenarios while controlling the existing system
with good pre-dropout policies. The policy IS routine produces value estimates
for both the robust MDP and specific post-dropout system realizations and is
justified with exponential confidence bounds. Finally, the utility of this
approach is verified in simulation, showing how structural properties of agent
dropout can help a controller find good post-dropout policies before dropout
occurs.

interactive decision making (bandits, reinforcement learning, and beyond) that,
rather than only performing well in the worst case, adapt to favorable
properties of real-world instances for improved performance. We aim for
instance-optimality, a strong notion of adaptivity which asserts that, on any
particular problem instance, the algorithm under consideration outperforms all
consistent algorithms. Instance-optimality enjoys a rich asymptotic theory
originating from the work of
\citet{lai1985asymptotically,graves1997asymptotically}, but non-asymptotic
guarantees have remained elusive outside of certain special cases. Even for
problems as simple as tabular reinforcement learning, existing algorithms do
not attain instance-optimal performance until the number of rounds of
interaction is doubly exponential in the number of states.
  In this paper, we take the first step toward developing a non-asymptotic
theory of instance-optimal decision making with general function approximation.
We introduce a new complexity measure, the Allocation-Estimation Coefficient
(AEC), and provide a new algorithm, $\mathsf{AE}^2$, which attains
non-asymptotic instance-optimal performance at a rate controlled by the AEC.
Our results recover the best known guarantees for well-studied problems such as
finite-armed and linear bandits and, when specialized to tabular reinforcement
learning, attain the first instance-optimal regret bounds with polynomial
dependence on all problem parameters, improving over prior work exponentially.
We complement these results with lower bounds that show that i) existing
notions of statistical complexity are insufficient to derive non-asymptotic
guarantees, and ii) under certain technical conditions, boundedness of the AEC
is necessary to learn an instance-optimal allocation of decisions in finite
time.

representation in terms of color and density, enabling computational redundancy
to be squeezed out by adopting different (1) grid sizes and (2) update
frequencies for the color and density branches. Our hardware accelerator
further reduces the dominant memory accesses for embedding grid interpolation
by (1) mapping multiple nearby points' memory read requests into one during the
feed-forward process, (2) merging embedding grid updates from the same sliding
time window during back-propagation, and (3) fusing different computation cores
to support the different grid sizes needed by the color and density branches of

Instant-3D, achieving a large training time reduction of 41x - 248x while

considerably. In addition to the synthesis of new materials, the possibility of
realizing ultracold atoms on an optical kagome lattice (KL) raises interesting
issues. For instance, by considering the Hubbard model on an anisotropic KL,
with a hopping $t^\prime$ along one of the directions, one is able to
interpolate between the Lieb lattice ($t^\prime=0$) and the isotropic KL
($t^\prime=t$). The ground state of the former is a ferrimagnetic insulator for
any on-site repulsion, $U$, while the latter displays a transition between a
paramagnetic metal and a Mott insulator. One may thus consider $t^\prime$ as a
parameter controlling the degree of magnetic frustration in the system. By
means of extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we have examined magnetic
and transport properties as $t^\prime$ varies between these limits in order to
set up a phase diagram in the $(U/t, t^\prime/t)$ parameter space. As an
auxiliary response, analysis of the average sign of the fermionic determinant

difficult because they do not admit standard dynamic programming equations

decompositions that augment the state space with discrete risk levels have
recently gained popularity in the RL community. Prior work has shown that these
decompositions are optimal when the risk level is discretized sufficiently.
However, we show that these popular decompositions for
Conditional-Value-at-Risk (CVaR) and Entropic-Value-at-Risk (EVaR) are
inherently suboptimal regardless of the discretization level. In particular, we
show that a saddle point property assumed to hold in prior literature may be
violated. However, a decomposition does hold for Value-at-Risk and our proof
demonstrates how this risk measure differs from CVaR and EVaR. Our findings are
significant because risk-averse algorithms are used in high-stake environments,
making their correctness much more critical.

this limitation, this paper proposes a 3D controllable generative face model to
produce high-quality albedo and precise 3D shape leveraging existing 2D

manipulation, this method enables editing of detailed 3D rendered faces. The
proposed framework utilizes an alternating descent optimization approach over
shape and albedo. Differentiable rendering is used to train high-quality shapes
and albedo without 3D supervision. Moreover, this approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the well-known NoW benchmark for shape
reconstruction. It also outperforms the SOTA reconstruction models in
recovering rendered faces' identities across novel poses by an average of 10%.
Additionally, the paper demonstrates direct control of expressions in 3D faces
by exploiting latent space leading to text-based editing of 3D faces.

evaluate the impact of different queue routing strategies. Our simulation
results show that by changing the way RHY is routed to shelters, we can reduce
the average wait time by approximately a day and decrease the proportion of RHY

framework that allows the combination of GCNs with different types of manifold

employed are completely unsupervised, which is especially useful for scenarios
where the availability of labeled data is a concern. A broad experimental

interact pairwise over a weighted graph with two communities. Edges within each
community have identical weights, different from the weights between
communities. It is shown that, at the early stage of the opinion evolution, the
expected agent states in the same community have identical sign, despite
influence of stubborn agents. Moreover, it is shown that the expected states of
the agents in the same community concentrate around the initial average opinion
of that community, if the weights within communities are larger than between.
In contrast, if the edge weights between communities are larger, then the
expected states of all agents concentrate around everyone's initial average
opinion. Different from the traditional asymptotic analysis in the opinion
dynamics literature, these results focus on the initial phase of opinion
evolution and establish a correspondence between community structure and
transient behavior of the gossip model. The results are illustrated by
numerical examples.

for both active droplets and isotropically active particles in an unbounded

be experimentally observed for active particles. In this paper, we
theoretically demonstrate that spontaneous motion for an active spherical
particle closely fitting in a cylindrical channel is possible at arbitrarily
small $Pe$. Scaling arguments in the limit where the dimensionless clearance
$\epsilon\ll1$ reveal that when $Pe=O(\epsilon^{1/2})$, the confined particle
reaches speeds comparable to those achieved in an unbounded fluid at moderate

distinguished limit, where the fluid domain decomposes into several asymptotic
regions: a gap region, where the lubrication approximation applies;
particle-scale regions, where the concentration is uniform; and far-field
regions, where solute transport is one-dimensional. We derive an asymptotic

$\overline{Pe}\searrow0$. Our results could pave the way for experimental

  Interference: An Application to Air Pollution Regulatory Policy",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Marginalized groups are exposed to disproportionately high levels of air
pollution. In this context, robust evaluations of the heterogeneous health
impacts of air pollution regulations are key to justifying and designing
maximally protective future interventions. Such evaluations are complicated by
two key issues: 1) much of air pollution regulatory policy is focused on
intervening on large emissions generators while resulting health impacts are
measured in exposed populations; 2) due to air pollution transport, an
intervention on one emissions generator can impact geographically distant
communities. In causal inference, such a scenario has been described as that of
bipartite network interference (BNI). To our knowledge, no literature to date
has considered how to estimate heterogeneous causal effects with BNI. First, we
propose, implement, and evaluate causal estimators for subgroup-specific
treatment effects via augmented inverse propensity weighting and G-computation
methods in the context of BNI. Second, we design and implement an empirical
Monte Carlo simulation approach for BNI through which we evaluate the
performance of the proposed estimators. Third, we use the proposed methods to
estimate the causal effects of flue gas desulfurization scrubber installations
on coal-fired power plants on ischemic heart disease hospitalizations among
27,312,190 Medicare beneficiaries residing across 29,034 U.S. ZIP codes. While

high-poverty and predominantly non-white ZIP codes, scrubber installations at
their most influential power plants, when less-influential plants are
untreated, are found to result in statistically significant decreases in IHD
hospitalizations, with reduction ranging from 6.4 to 43.1 hospitalizations per

along with communication (e.g., 6G), computing (e.g., edge computing), and
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to enable many connected intelligence
services. In order to handle the large amounts of network data based on digital
twins (DTs), wireless systems can exploit the paradigm of semantic
communication (SC) for facilitating informed decision-making under strict
communication constraints by utilizing AI techniques such as causal reasoning.
In this paper, a novel framework called causal semantic communication (CSC) is
proposed for DT-based wireless systems. The CSC system is posed as an imitation
learning (IL) problem, where the transmitter, with access to optimal network
control policies using a DT, teaches the receiver using SC over a bandwidth
limited wireless channel how to improve its knowledge to perform optimal
control actions. The causal structure in the source data is extracted using
novel approaches from the framework of deep end-to-end causal inference,
thereby enabling the creation of a semantic representation that is causally
invariant, which in turn helps generalize the learned knowledge of the system
to unseen scenarios. The CSC decoder at the receiver is designed to extract and
estimate semantic information while ensuring high semantic reliability. The
receiver control policies, semantic decoder, and causal inference are
formulated as a bi-level optimization problem within a variational inference
framework. This problem is solved using a novel concept called network state
models, inspired from world models in generative AI, that faithfully represents
the environment dynamics leading to data generation. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed CSC system outperforms state-of-the-art SC
systems by achieving better semantic reliability and reduced semantic
representation.

discovering the presence of hidden information within stego-images using
trained neural networks as steganalyzers that are applied to stego-images. Our
results show that such steganalyzers are less effective when SA-CNN is employed
during the generation of a stego-image. We also explore the advantages and
disadvantages of representing all the possible outputs of our SA-CNN within a
smaller, discrete space, rather than a continuous space. Our SA-CNN enables
certain classes of parametric steganographic algorithms to be customized based
on characteristics of the cover media in which information is to be embedded.
Thus, SA-CNN is adaptive in the sense that it enables the core steganographic
algorithm to be especially configured for each particular instance of cover
media. Experimental results are provided that employ a recent steganographic
technique, S-UNIWARD, both with and without the use of SA-CNN. We then apply
both sets of stego-images, those produced with and without SA-CNN, to an

this approach for the integration of neural networks with hand-crafted

functionality of devices and applications based on the diamond-silica
interface. Controlling these phenomena is highly desirable, but difficult since
extrinsic factors, such as the surface termination by adsorbed species, can
deeply affect the reactivity of diamond and its resistance to wear. In this
work, we investigate the effects of diamond oxidation by massive ab initio
molecular dynamics simulations of silica sliding against diamond surfaces
considering different surface orientations, O-coverages, and tribological
conditions. Our findings reveal a dual role of oxygen that depends on coverage.
At full coverage, the adsorbed oxygen is very effective in friction and wear
reduction because the repulsion with the silica counter-surface prevents the
formation of chemical bonds across the interface. At reduced coverage and high
pressure, Si-O-C bonds are anyway established. In this situation the presence
of oxygen results detrimental as it weakens the surface C-C bonds making the
surface more vulnerable to wear. Indeed we observed atomic wear on the C(110)
surface at 50% O-coverage under harsh tribological conditions. The mechanisms
of friction reduction and atomistic wear are explained through the analysis of
the electronic properties and surface-surface interactions. Overall, our
accurate in silico experiments shed light into the effects of adsorbed oxygen
on the tribological behavior of diamond and show how oxidized diamond can be
worn by silica.

However, in addition to confidently presenting factually inaccurate information

number of input and output tokens that can be processed at once, making them
potentially less effective on tasks that require processing a large set or
continuous stream of information. A common approach to reducing the size of
data is through lossless or lossy compression. Yet, in some cases it may not be
strictly necessary to perfectly recover every detail from the original data, as
long as a requisite level of semantic precision or intent is conveyed.

on downstream tasks, fully unleashing FViTs' potential under data-limited
scenarios (e.g., few-shot tuning) remains a challenge due to FViTs' data-hungry
nature. Common data augmentation techniques fall short in this context due to
the limited features contained in the few-shot tuning data. To tackle this
challenge, we first identify an opportunity for FViTs in few-shot tuning:
pretrained FViTs themselves have already learned highly representative features
from large-scale pretraining data, which are fully preserved during widely used
parameter-efficient tuning. We thus hypothesize that leveraging those learned
features to augment the tuning data can boost the effectiveness of few-shot
FViT tuning. To this end, we propose a framework called Hint-based Data
Augmentation (Hint-Aug), which aims to boost FViT in few-shot tuning by
augmenting the over-fitted parts of tuning samples with the learned features of
pretrained FViTs. Specifically, Hint-Aug integrates two key enablers: (1) an
Attentive Over-fitting Detector (AOD) to detect over-confident patches of
foundation ViTs for potentially alleviating their over-fitting on the few-shot
tuning data and (2) a Confusion-based Feature Infusion (CFI) module to infuse
easy-to-confuse features from the pretrained FViTs with the over-confident
patches detected by the above AOD in order to enhance the feature diversity
during tuning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on five datasets and
three parameter-efficient tuning techniques consistently validate Hint-Aug's
effectiveness: 0.04% ~ 32.91% higher accuracy over the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
data augmentation method under various low-shot settings. For example, on the
Pet dataset, Hint-Aug achieves a 2.22% higher accuracy with 50% less training
data over SOTA data augmentation methods.

high token-diversity to generate image features. Img2Vec pre-trained on
ImageNet unlabeled data with ViT-B yields 85.1\% top-1 accuracy on fine-tuning.
Moreover, we scale up Img2Vec on larger models, ViT-L and ViT-H, and get
$86.7\%$ and $87.5\%$ accuracy respectively. It also achieves state-of-the-art
results on other downstream tasks, e.g., 51.8\% mAP on COCO and 50.7\% mIoU on
ADE20K. Img2Vec is a simple yet effective framework tailored to deep feature
MIM learning, accomplishing superb comprehensive performance on representative
vision tasks.

image generation and manipulation. In this paper, we explore a novel paradigm
of using the diffusion model and classifier guidance in the latent semantic
space for compositional visual tasks. Specifically, we train latent diffusion
models and auxiliary latent classifiers to facilitate non-linear navigation of
latent representation generation for any pre-trained generative model with a
semantic latent space. We demonstrate that such conditional generation achieved
by latent classifier guidance provably maximizes a lower bound of the
conditional log probability during training. To maintain the original semantics
during manipulation, we introduce a new guidance term, which we show is crucial
for achieving compositionality. With additional assumptions, we show that the
non-linear manipulation reduces to a simple latent arithmetic approach. We show
that this paradigm based on latent classifier guidance is agnostic to
pre-trained generative models, and present competitive results for both image
generation and sequential manipulation of real and synthetic images. Our
findings suggest that latent classifier guidance is a promising approach that
merits further exploration, even in the presence of other strong competing
methods.

users and merchants, where the service search engine plays a vital role in
improving the user experience by quickly obtaining desirable results via
textual queries. Unfortunately, users' uncontrollable search customs usually
bring vast amounts of long-tail queries, which severely threaten the capability
of search models. Inspired by recently emerging graph neural networks (GNNs)
and contrastive learning (CL), several efforts have been made in alleviating
the long-tail issue and achieve considerable performance. Nevertheless, they
still face a few major weaknesses. Most importantly, they do not explicitly
utilize the contextual structure between heads and tails for effective
knowledge transfer, and intention-level information is commonly ignored for
more generalized representations.
  To this end, we develop a novel framework GARCIA, which exploits the graph
based knowledge transfer and intention based representation generalization in a
contrastive setting. In particular, we employ an adaptive encoder to produce
informative representations for queries and services, as well as hierarchical
structure aware representations of intentions. To fully understand tail queries
and services, we equip GARCIA with a novel multi-granularity contrastive
learning module, which powers representations through knowledge transfer,
structure enhancement and intention generalization. Subsequently, the complete
GARCIA is well trained in a pre-training&fine-tuning manner. At last, we
conduct extensive experiments on both offline and online environments, which
demonstrates the superior capability of GARCIA in improving tail queries and
overall performance in service search scenarios.

networks. Such adversarial network perturbation greatly influences the opinion
formation of the public and threatens our societies. Thus, it is critical to
study and control the influence of adversarial network perturbation. Although
tremendous efforts have been made in both academia and industry to guide and
control the public opinion dynamics, most of these works assume that the
network is static, and ignore such adversarial network perturbation. In this
work, based on the well-accepted Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model, we
model the adversarial network perturbation and analyze its impact on the

optimal network perturbation, which maximally changes the network's opinion.
Next, from the network defender's perspective, we formulate a Stackelberg game

three-dimensional vortex dynamics of pitching swept wings, with the sweep angle
ranging from 0 to 25 degrees. The structural dynamics of the wings are
simulated using a cyber-physical control system. With a constant flow speed, a
prescribed high inertia and a small structural damping, we show that the system
undergoes a subcritical Hopf bifurcation to large-amplitude limit-cycle
oscillations (LCOs) for all the sweep angles. The onset of LCOs depends largely
on the static characteristics of the wing. The saddle-node point is found to
change non-monotonically with the sweep angle, which we attribute to the
non-monotonic power transfer between the ambient fluid and the elastic mount.
An optimal sweep angle is observed to enhance the power extraction performance
and thus promote LCOs and destabilize the aeroelastic system. The frequency
response of the system reveals a structural-hydrodynamic oscillation mode for
wings with relatively high sweep angles. Force, moment, and three-dimensional
flow structures measured using multi-layer stereoscopic particle image
velocimetry are analyzed to explain the differences in power extraction for
different swept wings. Finally, we employ a physics-based Force and Moment

computing (HPC) systems generate vast data volumes. Thus, data compression is
becoming a critical technique to mitigate the storage burden and data-movement
cost. However, existing lossy compressors for scientific data cannot achieve a
high compression ratio and throughput simultaneously, hindering their adoption
in many applications requiring fast compression, such as in-memory compression.
To this end, in this work, we develop a fast and high-ratio error-bounded lossy
compressor on GPUs for scientific data (called FZ-GPU). Specifically, we first
design a new compression pipeline that consists of fully parallelized
quantization, bitshuffle, and our newly designed fast encoding. Then, we
propose a series of deep architectural optimizations for each kernel in the
pipeline to take full advantage of CUDA architectures. We propose a warp-level
optimization to avoid data conflicts for bit-wise operations in bitshuffle,
maximize shared memory utilization, and eliminate unnecessary data movements by
fusing different compression kernels. Finally, we evaluate FZ-GPU on two NVIDIA
GPUs (i.e., A100 and RTX A4000) using six representative scientific datasets
from SDRBench. Results on the A100 GPU show that FZ-GPU achieves an average
speedup of 4.2X over cuSZ and an average speedup of 37.0X over a multi-threaded
CPU implementation of our algorithm under the same error bound. FZ-GPU also
achieves an average speedup of 2.3X and an average compression ratio
improvement of 2.0X over cuZFP under the same data distortion.

formed during an ultra-slow-roll phase leading to a large enhancement of the
power spectrum of scalar (curvature) perturbations by 6 or 7 orders of

found that extreme fine-tuning of the parameters in our models can lead to a
formation of the Earth-size PBH with the masses of approximately $10^{27}$ g,

to the perturbative upper bound on the amplitude of large scalar perturbations

these pose a threat to democracy. While disagreement on policy issues is

and ideological sorting. Observational studies have described the rising
ideological alignment and experimental work has addressed the relevant
mechanisms involved in political interactions. However, how these two relevant
phenomena relate to each other is still unclear. To address this question, we
propose a multidimensional agent-based model that incorporates two main
mechanisms: homophily, in which people who share similar opinions are more
likely to interact, and ingroup-coherence favoritism, in which partisans are
more attracted to coherent ingroups rather than incoherent or outgroup members.
We developed and solved the model's master equations that perfectly describe
the simulated model's dynamics. We found that the ideological alignment
reported in political opinions in several experiments can only be explained by
the presence of ingroup-coherence favoritism in pairwise interactions. By
comparing the model's outcomes with more than 20,000 opinions from people
living in different countries, the model can infer the weight of
ingroup-coherence needed to match each other. We found a strong correspondence

impediment to its widespread adoption. The situation is further compounded by
the fact that O-RAN's flagship use case, network slicing, presents a rigid
dichotomy. On the one hand, systems research in the slicing domain is largely
centered around LTE, while, on the other hand, 3GPP slicing specifications
exclusively cater to 5G Standalone (SA). From a practical standpoint, most
commercial networks today use a mix of 4G, 5G NSA (Non-standalone), and 5G SA,
necessitating the need for solutions across all radio access technologies

HexRAN, a first of its kind purpose-built multi-RAT O-RAN compliant access

O-RAN service model in support of slicing. Furthermore, the paper also includes
a comprehensive system evaluation addressing the key themes of scalability and

arbitrarily hard without exploiting target domain information. To address this
issue, test-time adaptive (TTA) methods are proposed. Existing TTA methods
require offline target data or extra sophisticated optimization procedures
during the inference stage. In this work, we adopt Non-Parametric Classifier to
perform the test-time Adaptation (AdaNPC). In particular, we construct a memory
that contains the feature and label pairs from training domains. During
inference, given a test instance, AdaNPC first recalls K closed samples from
the memory to vote for the prediction, and then the test feature and predicted
label are added to the memory. In this way, the sample distribution in the
memory can be gradually changed from the training distribution towards the test
distribution with very little extra computation cost. We theoretically justify
the rationality behind the proposed method. Besides, we test our model on
extensive numerical experiments. AdaNPC significantly outperforms competitive
baselines on various DG benchmarks. In particular, when the adaptation target
is a series of domains, the adaptation accuracy of AdaNPC is 50% higher than
advanced TTA methods. The code is available at

the higher-order neighbor relations (i.e., a matching structure among multiple

superiority of capturing neighbor relations in single-modality retrieval tasks.
However, it is ineffective to directly extend existing re-ranking algorithms to
image-text retrieval. In this paper, we analyze the reason from four
perspectives, i.e., generalization, flexibility, sparsity, and asymmetry, and
propose a novel learnable pillar-based re-ranking paradigm. Concretely, we
first select top-ranked intra- and inter-modal neighbors as pillars, and then
reconstruct data samples with the neighbor relations between them and the

excavate the sparse positive items within a neighborhood. We also present a
structure alignment constraint to promote cross-modal collaboration and align

and hardware have converged with the High Performance Computing (HPC)
counterparts. Nevertheless, the programming methodology of DL and HPC systems

vendor-optimized libraries. Such libraries provide close-to-peak performance on
specific platforms, kernels and shapes thereof that vendors have dedicated
optimizations efforts, while they underperform in the remaining use-cases,
yielding non-portable codes with performance glass-jaws. This work introduces a
framework to develop efficient, portable DL and HPC kernels for modern CPU
architectures. We decompose the kernel development in two steps: 1) Expressing
the computational core using Tensor Processing Primitives (TPPs): a compact,
versatile set of 2D-tensor operators, 2) Expressing the logical loops around
TPPs in a high-level, declarative fashion whereas the exact instantiation
(ordering, tiling, parallelization) is determined via simple knobs. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach using standalone kernels and
end-to-end workloads that outperform state-of-the-art implementations on
diverse CPU platforms.

light detection and ranging~(LiDAR) sensors has been increased to model
environments for efficient site management. However, it is observed that
sometimes LiDAR-based approaches diverge in narrow and confined environments,
such as spiral stairs and corridors, caused by fixed parameters regardless of
the changes in the environments. That is, the parameters of LiDAR (-inertial)
odometry are mostly set for open space; thus, if the same parameters suitable
for the open space are applied in a corridor-like scene, it results in
divergence of odometry methods, which is referred to as \textit{degeneracy}. To
tackle this degeneracy problem, we propose a robust LiDAR inertial odometry
called \textit{AdaLIO}, which employs an adaptive parameter setting strategy.
To this end, we first check the degeneracy by checking whether the surroundings
are corridor-like environments. If so, the parameters relevant to voxelization
and normal vector estimation are adaptively changed to increase the number of
correspondences. As verified in a public dataset, our proposed method showed
promising performance in narrow and cramped environments, avoiding the
degeneracy problem.

function not necessarily conserved in the whole phase space $T^*Q$ but when
restricted to a certain invariant subspace ${\cal W}\subseteq T^*Q$ it becomes
a Liouville first integral. For natural Hamiltonian systems, it is demonstrated
that such a function $\cal I$ allows us to construct a lower dimensional

K at 5 T for CrI$_3$/Hf. This improved MCE is ascribed to the enhancement of
magnetic moment and intralayer exchange coupling in CrI$_3$ due to the

further found to tune MCE of CrI$_3$ in heterostructures and could shift the
peak temperature by around 10 K in CrI$_3$/Hf, thus manipulating the working

Here, with the help of self-supervised learning, we propose a physics-informed

present a low-complexity link scheduling algorithm that divides the D2D network

buildings and roads. Effective detection of surface cracks is significant for
damage evaluation and structure maintenance. In recent years, the emergence and
development of deep learning techniques have shown great potential to
facilitate surface crack detection. Currently, most reported tasks were
performed by a convolutional neural network (CNN), while the limitation of CNN
may be improved by the transformer architecture introduced recently. In this
study, we investigated nine promising models to evaluate their performance in
pavement surface crack detection by model accuracy, computational complexity,
and model stability. We created 711 images of 224 by 224 pixels with crack
labels, selected an optimal loss function, compared the evaluation metrics of
the validation dataset and test dataset, analyzed the data details, and checked
the segmentation outcomes of each model. We find that transformer-based models
generally are easier to converge during the training process and have higher
accuracy, but usually exhibit more memory consumption and low processing
efficiency. Among nine models, SwinUNet outperforms the other two transformers
and shows the highest accuracy among nine models. The results should shed light
on surface crack detection by various deep-learning models and provide a
guideline for future applications in this field.

shown that parallel-in-time techniques have the potential to remedy one of the
main computational drawbacks of parallel-in-space solvers. In particular, it is
well-known that for large-scale evolution problems space parallelization
saturates long before all processing cores are effectively used on today's
large scale parallel computers. Among the many approaches for time-parallel
time integration, ParaDiag schemes have proved themselves to be a very
effective approach. In this framework, the time stepping matrix or an
approximation thereof is diagonalized by Fourier techniques, so that
computations taking place at different time steps can be indeed carried out in
parallel. We propose here a new ParaDiag algorithm combining the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula and Krylov techniques. A panel of diverse

centrifugal forces that cause W to accumulate in the outboard region,
generating an in-out poloidal asymmetry. This asymmetry enhances neoclassical
inward convection, which can lead to central accumulation of W in cases of
strong plasma rotation. The core accumulation of W is mainly driven by inward
neoclassical convection. However, as momentum injection continues,
roto-diffusion, proportional to the radial gradient of the toroidal velocity,
becomes significant and generate outward turbulent flux in the case of ion

industrial communities as many graphs in real applications evolve over time.
Continuous subgraph matching (shorted as CSM) aims to report the incremental
matches of a query graph in such streaming graphs. It involves two major steps,
i.e., candidate maintenance and incremental match generation, to answer CSM.
Throughout the course of continuous subgraph matching, incremental match
generation backtracking over the search space dominates the total cost.
However, most previous approaches focus on developing techniques for efficient
candidate maintenance, while incremental match generation receives less
attention despite its importance in CSM. Aiming to minimize the overall cost,
we propose two techniques to reduce backtrackings in this paper. We present a
cost-effective index CaLiG that yields tighter candidate maintenance, shrinking
the search space of backtracking. In addition, we develop a novel incremental
matching paradigm KSS that decomposes the query vertices into conditional
kernel vertices and shell vertices. With the matches of kernel vertices, the
incremental matches can be produced immediately by joining the candidates of
shell vertices without any backtrackings. Benefiting from reduced
backtrackings, the elapsed time of CSM decreases significantly. Extensive
experiments over real graphs show that our method runs faster than the
state-of-the-art algorithm orders of magnitude.

localize temporal boundaries of actions for the video, given only video-level
category labels in the training datasets. Due to the lack of boundary
information during training, existing approaches formulate WTAL as a
classificationproblem, i.e., generating the temporal class activation map
(T-CAM) for localization. However, with only classification loss, the model
would be sub-optimized, i.e., the action-related scenes are enough to
distinguish different class labels. Regarding other actions in the
action-related scene ( i.e., the scene same as positive actions) as co-scene
actions, this sub-optimized model would misclassify the co-scene actions as
positive actions. To address this misclassification, we propose a simple yet
efficient method, named bidirectional semantic consistency constraint (Bi-SCC),
to discriminate the positive actions from co-scene actions. The proposed Bi-SCC
firstly adopts a temporal context augmentation to generate an augmented video
that breaks the correlation between positive actions and their co-scene actions
in the inter-video; Then, a semantic consistency constraint (SCC) is used to
enforce the predictions of the original video and augmented video to be
consistent, hence suppressing the co-scene actions. However, we find that this
augmented video would destroy the original temporal context. Simply applying
the consistency constraint would affect the completeness of localized positive
actions. Hence, we boost the SCC in a bidirectional way to suppress co-scene
actions while ensuring the integrity of positive actions, by cross-supervising
the original and augmented videos. Finally, our proposed Bi-SCC can be applied
to current WTAL approaches, and improve their performance. Experimental results
show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on THUMOS14 and

structurally nontrivial, so-called non-Ising domain walls, where the
Polarisation is non-zero along the entire wall. Our approach enables us to find
solutions for domain walls in any orientation, and the existence and energy of
these walls depend on their particular orientation. We find that, across all
phases of the material, there are orientations where the non-Ising walls have
lower energy than Ising walls. The most interesting property of these domain
walls is their non-monotonic interaction forces, allowing them to form stable
domain-wall clusters rather than following standard behavior where domain walls
annihilate or repel each other. We found the required external electric field
to create the non-Ising configurations. Besides theoretical interest, this
unconventional property of domain walls makes them a good candidate for memory

crossflow aligned with the freestream. An open-loop optimal periodic forcing is
defined by the carrier frequency, the duty cycle and the phase difference
between actuators as control parameters. The control laws are optimised with
respect to the unperturbed TBL and to the actuation with a steady jet. The cost
function includes the wall convective heat transfer rate and the cost of the

thermography and characterised also with particle image velocimetry
measurements. The optimal controller yields a slightly asymmetric flow field.
The LGAC algorithm converges to the same frequency and duty cycle for all the
actuators. It is noted that such frequency is strikingly equal to the inverse
of the characteristic travel time of large-scale turbulent structures advected
within the near-wall region. The phase difference between multiple jet
actuation has shown to be very relevant and the main driver of flow asymmetry.
The results pinpoint the potential of machine learning control in unravelling

matter, i.e., $\sigma/m<{\cal O}(0.1)\,{\rm cm^2/g}$ at the scattering velocity
of ${\cal O}(10)\,{\rm km/s}$. Resonant self-interacting dark matter (rSIDM) is
one possibility that can be consistent with the UFDs and explain the low
central densities of rotation-supported galaxies; the cross section is
resonantly enhanced to be $\sigma/m = {\cal O}(1)\,{\rm cm^2/g}$ around the
scattering velocity of ${\cal O}(100)\,{\rm km/s}$ while being suppressed at
lower velocities. To further assess this possibility, since the inferred dark
matter distribution of halos from astrophysical observations is usually
compared to that in constant-cross section SIDM (cSIDM), whether the structures
of rSIDM halos can be approximated by the cSIDM halo profiles needs to be
clarified. In this work, we employ the grovothermal fluid method to investigate
the structural evolution of rSIDM halos in a wide mass range. We find that
except for halos in a specific mass range, the present structures of rSIDM
halos are virtually indistinguishable from those of the cSIDM halos. For halos
in the specific mass range, the resonant self-scattering renders a break in
their density profile. We demonstrate how such a density-profile break appears
in astrophysical observations, e.g., rotation curves and line-of-sight velocity
dispersion profiles. We show that for halos above the specific mass range, the
density-profile break thermalizes to disappear before the present. We
demonstrate that such distinctive thermalization dynamics can leave imprints on
the orbital classes of stars with similar ages and metallicities.

highly-sparse models, e.g. with less than 10% remaining weights, which do not
decrease in accuracy nor substantially increase in bias when compared to dense

models exhibit higher uncertainty in their outputs, as well as increased
correlations, which we directly link to increased bias. We propose easy-to-use
criteria which, based only on the uncompressed model, establish whether bias
will increase with pruning, and identify the samples most susceptible to biased

involves identifying three-dimensional (3D) geometry, such as the location of
corners and boundaries, and performing 3D reconstruction. However, occlusion is
a common issue that can negatively impact room layout estimation, and this has
not been thoroughly studied to date. It is possible to obtain 3D shape
information of rooms as drawings of buildings and coordinates of corners from
image datasets, thus we propose providing both 2D panoramic and 3D information
to a model to effectively deal with occlusion. However, simply feeding 3D
information to a model is not sufficient to utilize the shape information for
an occluded area. Therefore, we improve the model by introducing 3D
Intersection over Union (IoU) loss to effectively use 3D information. In some
cases, drawings are not available or the construction deviates from a drawing.
Considering such practical cases, we propose a method for distilling knowledge
from a model trained with both images and 3D information to a model that takes
only images as input. The proposed model, which is called Shape-Net, achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on benchmark datasets. We also confirmed
its effectiveness in dealing with occlusion through significantly improved

hierarchy of moment-SOS relaxations for this problem to obtain convergent upper
bounds of the optimal value by solving a sequence of semidefinite programs. To
this end, we apply the Positivstellensatz for polynomial matrices and its dual

this hierarchy to solve the problem of minimizing the smallest eigenvalue of a

conversational agent would need to be able to provide search capabilities over
the item catalog, understand and make recommendations based on the user's
preferences, and answer a range of questions related to items and their usage.
Yet, existing conversational datasets do not fully support the idea of mixing
different conversational goals (i.e., search, recommendation, and question
answering) and instead focus on a single goal. To address this, we introduce
MG-ShopDial: a dataset of conversations mixing different goals in the domain of
e-commerce. Specifically, we make the following contributions. First, we
develop a coached human-human data collection protocol where each dialogue
participant is given a set of instructions, instead of a specific script or
answers to choose from. Second, we implement a data collection tool to
facilitate the collection of multi-goal conversations via a web chat interface,
using the above protocol. Third, we create the MG-ShopDial collection, which
contains 64 high-quality dialogues with a total of 2,196 utterances for
e-commerce scenarios of varying complexity. The dataset is additionally
annotated with both intents and goals on the utterance level. Finally, we
present an analysis of this dataset and identify multi-goal conversational
patterns.

inconsistent zero-shot segmentation performance across different unseen medical

particular when multi-temporal data are concerned. In landscapes with complex
geometry such as urban environment, vertical information turn out to be a very
useful knowledge not only to highlight changes but also to classify them into
different categories. In this paper, we focus on change segmentation directly
using raw 3D point clouds (PCs), to avoid any loss of information due to
rasterization processes. While deep learning has recently proved its
effectiveness for this particular task by encoding the information through
Siamese networks, we investigate here the idea of also using change information
in early steps of deep networks. To do this, we first propose to provide the
Siamese KPConv State-of-The-Art (SoTA) network with hand-crafted features and
especially a change-related one. This improves the mean of Intersection over
Union (IoU) over classes of change by 4.70\%. Considering that the major
improvement was obtained thanks to the change-related feature, we propose three
new architectures to address 3D PCs change segmentation: OneConvFusion, Triplet
KPConv, and Encoder Fusion SiamKPConv. All the three networks take into account
change information in early steps and outperform SoTA methods. In particular,
the last network, entitled Encoder Fusion SiamKPConv, overtakes SoTA with more
than 5% of mean of IoU over classes of change emphasizing the value of having
the network focus on change information for change detection task.

Carter constant leads to that of unstable circular photon orbits on a
two-dimensional plane not limited to the equatorial plane and unstable
spherical photon orbits in the three-dimensional space. These circular or
spherical photon orbits can determine two impact parameters, which are used to
calculate black hole shadows. For the case of a spherically symmetric
nonrotating black hole, the black hole shadow is circular and its size is
independent of an observation angle and a plane on which a circular photon
orbit exists. The shadow size increases as any one of the parameters involving
the cloud of strings, quintessence parameter, and magnitude of quintessential
state parameter increases. However, the black hole shadow is dependent on the
observation angle when the black hole is spinning and axially symmetric. The
shadow is nearly circular when the observation angle decreases to zero for a
larger black hole spin. It seems to be more deformable when the black hole spin
increases for a larger observation angle. In this case, the shadow size
increases as any one of the parameters increases. The curvature radii at the
characteristic points increase with the parameters increasing. Based on the
Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87*, the constraint of the curvature
radius is used to constrain the parameters. For slowly rotating spin black
holes, the allowed regions of the parameters including the cosmological
constant are given.

within a fixed range. This partial observability affects the agent's ability to
assess the quality of the actions of surrounding agents. This paper focuses on
developing a method to capture more effective information from local
observations in order to select more effective actions. Previous work in this
field employs probability distributions or weighted mean field to update the
average actions of neighborhood agents, but it does not fully consider the
feature information of surrounding neighbors and leads to a local optimum. In
this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm,
Partially Observable Mean Field Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning based on
Graph--Attention (GAMFQ) to remedy this flaw. GAMFQ uses a graph attention
module and a mean field module to describe how an agent is influenced by the
actions of other agents at each time step. This graph attention module consists
of a graph attention encoder and a differentiable attention mechanism, and this
mechanism outputs a dynamic graph to represent the effectiveness of
neighborhood agents against central agents. The mean--field module approximates
the effect of a neighborhood agent on a central agent as the average effect of
effective neighborhood agents. We evaluate GAMFQ on three challenging tasks in
the MAgents framework. Experiments show that GAMFQ outperforms baselines
including the state-of-the-art partially observable mean-field reinforcement

  ratio dependance","Submitted to the Journal for Fluid Mechanics",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Vertical convection, often also called lateral convection, is the fluid
motion that is induced by the heating and cooling of two opposed vertical
boundaries of a rectangular cavity. In this numerical study, we consider the
linear stability of the steady two-dimensional flow reached at Rayleigh numbers
of O($10^8$). This flow consists of two plume motions near the boundaries and a
linear stable temperature stratification in the interior. As a function of the
Prandtl number, $Pr$, and the height-to-width aspect ratio of the domain, $A$,
the base flow (steady state) of each case is computed and linear simulations
are used to obtain the properties of the leading linear mode of instability.
  The flow regimes show a rich variation with Prandtl number and aspect ratio.
These regimes depend on whether the plumes generate a circulation in the entire
cavity, detach from the horizontal boundaries or the corner regions, and
further on whether the oscillation frequency of the instability is slower (or
faster) than the buoyancy frequency of the stratification in the interior, and
allows for the presence of internal waves (or not), Accordingly, the regime is
called slow or fast, respectively. Internal wave allow for the coupling between
the top and bottom plumes, and their absence implies asymmetry in part of the
regimes. Six essentially different flow regimes are found in the range of $0.1
\leq Pr \leq 4$ and $0.5 \leq A \leq 2$.

  Processing",,,,"eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Speech translation (ST) automatically converts utterances in a source
language into text in another language. Splitting continuous speech into
shorter segments, known as speech segmentation, plays an important role in ST.
Recent segmentation methods trained to mimic the segmentation of ST corpora
have surpassed traditional approaches. Tsiamas et al. proposed a segmentation
frame classifier (SFC) based on a pre-trained speech encoder called wav2vec
2.0. Their method, named SHAS, retains 95-98% of the BLEU score for ST corpus
segmentation. However, the segments generated by SHAS are very different from
ST corpus segmentation and tend to be longer with multiple combined utterances.
This is due to SHAS's reliance on length heuristics, i.e., it splits speech
into segments of easily translatable length without fully considering the
potential for ST improvement by splitting them into even shorter segments.
Longer segments often degrade translation quality and ST's time efficiency. In
this study, we extended SHAS to improve ST translation accuracy and efficiency
by splitting speech into shorter segments that correspond to sentences. We
introduced a simple segmentation algorithm using the moving average of SFC
predictions without relying on length heuristics and explored wav2vec 2.0
fine-tuning for improved speech segmentation prediction. Our experimental
results reveal that our speech segmentation method significantly improved the
quality and the time efficiency of speech translation compared to SHAS.

between $10^{16}$ cm to $10^{17}$ cm from the supermassive black hole, deducing
it was non-relativistic and launched quasi-simultaneously with the initial

ejected from stream-stream collisions (more likely), the unbound debris stream,

climate science and aviation technology. Probing the atomic structure in the
homogeneous ice nucleation process from scratch is of great value but still
experimentally unachievable. Theoretical simulations have found that ice
originates from the low-mobile region with increasing abundance and persistence
of tetrahedrally coordinated water molecules. However, a detailed microscopic
picture of how the disordered hydrogen-bond network rearranges itself into an
ordered network is still unclear. In this work, we use a deep neural network
(DNN) model to ""learn"" the interatomic potential energy from quantum mechanical
data, thereby allowing for large-scale and long molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations with ab initio accuracy. The nucleation mechanism and dynamics at
atomic resolution, represented by a total of 36 $\mu$s-long MD trajectories,
are deeply affected by the structural and dynamical heterogeneity in
supercooled water. We find that imperfectly coordinated (IC) water molecules
with high mobility pave the way for hydrogen-bond network rearrangement,
leading to the growth or shrinkage of the ice nucleus. The hydrogen-bond
network formed by perfectly coordinated (PC) molecules stabilizes the nucleus,
thus preventing it from vanishing and growing. Consequently, ice is born
through competition and cooperation between IC and PC molecules. We anticipate
that our picture of the microscopic mechanism of ice nucleation will provide
new insights into many properties of water and other relevant materials.

Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique to provide stakeholders of complex

explanations results in a potential disagreement problem among stakeholders.
Ethical issues arise when for example, malicious agents use this diversity to
fairwash an unfair machine learning model by hiding sensitive features. As
legislators worldwide tend to start including the right to explanations for
data-driven, high-stakes decisions in their policies, these ethical issues

quantum network protocols that require a certain number of entangled pairs.
Here, we consider a setting in which a process generates a quantum resource

memory that is subject to time-dependent noise. To maintain sufficient quality
for an application, each resource state is discarded from the memory after $w$
time steps. Let $s$ be the number of desired resource states required by a
protocol. We characterise the probability distribution $X_{(w,s)}$ of the ages
of the quantum resource states, once $s$ states have been generated in a window
$w$. Combined with a time-dependent noise model, the knowledge of this
distribution allows for the calculation of fidelity statistics of the $s$

Specifically, with an example of a Blind Quantum Computing (BQC) protocol, we

the learner with communication-constrained feedback based on the rewards for

such that the second moment of the encoded rewards is no more than $P$, and
this encoded reward is further corrupted by additive Gaussian noise of variance

for sharing statistics of datasets while limiting the disclosure of private
information about the involved individuals. This is achieved by randomly
perturbing the statistics to be published, which in turn leads to a
privacy-accuracy trade-off: larger perturbations provide stronger privacy
guarantees, but they result in less accurate statistics that offer lower
utility to the recipients. Of particular interest are therefore optimal
mechanisms that provide the highest accuracy for a pre-selected level of
privacy. To date, work in this area has focused on specifying families of
perturbations a priori and subsequently proving their asymptotic and/or
best-in-class optimality. In this paper, we develop a class of mechanisms that
enjoy non-asymptotic and unconditional optimality guarantees. To this end, we
formulate the mechanism design problem as an infinite-dimensional
distributionally robust optimization problem. We show that the problem affords
a strong dual, and we exploit this duality to develop converging hierarchies of
finite-dimensional upper and lower bounding problems. Our upper (primal) bounds
correspond to implementable perturbations whose suboptimality can be bounded by
our lower (dual) bounds. Both bounding problems can be solved within seconds
via cutting plane techniques that exploit the inherent problem structure. Our
numerical experiments demonstrate that our perturbations can outperform the
previously best results from the literature on artificial as well as standard

We address such problems by designing an adaptive transmission scheme employing
multiuser shared access (MUSA) based grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access
and use short packet communication for low latency of the IoT-to-UAV
communication. Specifically, to accommodate bursty traffic, we design an
analytical framework and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the
performance by determining the optimal number of transmission time slots,
subject to the stringent reliability and latency constraints. We compare the

classical correlation by performing local quantum or classical operations on
the seed, i.e., any communications are not allowed. We consider the following
fundamental problem about this setting: whether Alice and Bob can use a given
seed to generate a target classical correlation. We show that this problem has
rich mathematical structures. Firstly, we prove that even if the seed is a pure
bipartite state, the above decision problem is already NP-hard and a similar
conclusion can also be drawn when the seed is also a classical correlation,
implying that this problem is hard to solve generally. Furthermore, we prove
that when the seed is a pure quantum state, solving the problem is equivalent
to finding out whether the target classical correlation has some canonical form
of positive semi-definite factorizations that matches the seed pure state,
revealing an interesting connection between the current problem and
optimization theory. Based on this observation and other insights, we give
several necessary conditions where the seed pure state has to satisfy to
generate the target classical correlation, and it turns out that these
conditions can also be generalized to the case that the seed is a mixed quantum
state. Lastly, since canonical forms of positive semi-definite factorizations
play a crucial role in solving the problem, we develop an algorithm that can
compute them for an arbitrary classical correlation, which has decent
performance on the cases we test.

  Technologies (MOCAST) on Electronics and Communications",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Systolic Array (SA) architectures are well suited for accelerating matrix
multiplications through the use of a pipelined array of Processing Elements
(PEs) communicating with local connections and pre-orchestrated data movements.
Even though most of the dynamic power consumption in SAs is due to
multiplications and additions, pipelined data movement within the SA
constitutes an additional important contributor. The goal of this work is to
reduce the dynamic power consumption associated with the feeding of data to the
SA, by synergistically applying bus-invert coding and zero-value clock gating.
By exploiting salient attributes of state-of-the-art CNNs, such as the value
distribution of the weights, the proposed SA applies appropriate encoding only
to the data that exhibits high switching activity. Similarly, when one of the
inputs is zero, unnecessary operations are entirely skipped. This selectively
targeted, application-aware encoding approach is demonstrated to reduce the
dynamic power consumption of data streaming in CNN applications using Bfloat16
arithmetic by 1%-19%. This translates to an overall dynamic power reduction of
6.2%-9.4%.

years in many AGN, the so called Ultra-Fast Outflows (UFOs). Outflows are
intimately related to mass accretion due to the conservation of angular
momentum, and therefore are a key ingredient of most accretion disk models
around BHs. At the same time, nuclear winds and outflows can provide the
feedback which regulates the joint BH and galaxy growth. We reconsider UFO
observations in the framework of the Magneto-Hydrodynamic Disk Wind (MHDW)
scenario and study their statistical properties. We derive the typical
wind-activity history in our sources by assuming that it can be statistically
described by population functions. We study the statistical properties of UFOs
from the literature and derive the distribution functions of the ratio $\bar
\omega$ between the mass outflow and inflow rates, and the ratio $\lambda_w$
between the mass outflow and the Eddington accretion rates. We study the links
between $\bar \omega$ and $\lambda_w$ and the Eddington ratio
$\lambda={L_{bol}}/{L_{Edd}}$. We find that the distribution functions of $\bar
\omega$ and $\lambda_w$ can be described as power laws above some threshold,
suggesting that there may be many wind sub-events for each major wind event in
each AGN activity cycle, which is a fractal behaviour in agreement with current
MHDW and Chaotic Cold Accretion theories. We then introduce a simple cellular
automaton to investigate how the dynamical properties of an idealized disk-wind
system changes following the introduction of simple feedback rules. We find
that without feedback the system is over-critical. Conversely, if feedback is
present, the system can be driven toward self organized criticality. Our
results corroborate the hypothesis that AGN feedback is a necessary key

CrPS$_4$ exhibit large, gate-tunable low-temperature magnetoconductance, due to
changes in magnetic state induced by the applied magnetic field. The
microscopic mechanism coupling the conductance to the magnetic state is however
not understood. We identify this mechanism by analyzing the evolution with
temperature and magnetic field of the parameters determining the transistor
behavior, the carrier mobility and threshold voltage. We find that for
temperatures $T$ close to the n\'eel temperature $T_N$, the magnetoconductance
originates from the increase in mobility due to cooling or the applied magnetic
field, which reduce disorder originating from spin fluctuations. For $T<<T_N$,
the mechanism is entirely different: the mobility is field and temperature
independent, and what changes is the threshold voltage, so that increasing the
field at fixed gate voltage increases the density of accumulated electrons. The
change in threshold voltage is due to a shift in the conduction band-edge as
confirmed by \emph{ab-initio} calculations that capture the magnitude of the
effect. Our results demonstrate that the bandstructure of CrPS$_4$ depends on
its magnetic state and reveal a mechanism for magnetoconductance in transistors

topological properties of our models reveal several intriguing results. For
example, they have complex energy gaps with distinct features, that is, a line
gap for the non-PT symmetric case and a point gap for the PT symmetric case.
Further, the NH skin effect, a distinctive feature of the NH system, is
non-existent here and is confirmed via computing the local density of states.
The bulk-boundary correspondence for both the NH variants obeys a bi-orthogonal

behaviour of the topological invariant, namely, the complex Berry phase, which
shows a sharp transition from a finite value to zero. Interestingly, the PT

in a suspension of passive particles with short-range repulsive interactions
and a larger self-diffusion coefficient. While the forces affecting the
single-particle are thermal-like fluctuations and repulsion, due to other
particles in the suspension, our numerical simulations show that on
intermediate time scales directed motion on a single-particle level emerges.
This emergent directional motion leads to a breakdown of the Einstein relation
and non-monotonic augmentation of the measured diffusion coefficient.
Directional tendency increases with the density of the suspension and leads to
growth of the diffusivity with the density of the suspension, a phenomenon
recently observed for a system of hard spheres by Ilker, Castellana, and
Joanny. Counter-intuitively, the directional flow originates from the tendency
of different particles to push each other out of their way. Due to such
strictly repulsive interactions, nearby particles form into temporally
correlated pairs and move cooperatively, thus creating a preferred direction of
motion on intermediate time scales. We show that directional motion emerges
when the ratio of the self-diffusion coefficients of the tracked particle and
suspension constituents is below a critical value.

  Prediction in ICU Trauma Patients",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sepsis is a syndrome that develops in response to the presence of infection.
It is characterized by severe organ dysfunction and is one of the leading
causes of mortality in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) worldwide. These
complications can be reduced through early application of antibiotics, hence
the ability to anticipate the onset of sepsis early is crucial to the survival
and well-being of patients. Current machine learning algorithms deployed inside
medical infrastructures have demonstrated poor performance and are insufficient
for anticipating sepsis onset early. In recent years, deep learning
methodologies have been proposed to predict sepsis, but some fail to capture
the time of onset (e.g., classifying patients' entire visits as developing
sepsis or not) and others are unrealistic to be deployed into medical
facilities (e.g., creating training instances using a fixed time to onset where
the time of onset needs to be known apriori). Therefore, in this paper, we
first propose a novel but realistic prediction framework that predicts each
morning whether sepsis onset will occur within the next 24 hours using data
collected at night, when patient-provider ratios are higher due to
cross-coverage resulting in limited observation to each patient. However, as we
increase the prediction rate into daily, the number of negative instances will
increase while that of positive ones remain the same. Thereafter, we have a
severe class imbalance problem, making a machine learning model hard to capture
rare sepsis cases. To address this problem, we propose to do nightly profile
representation learning (NPRL) for each patient. We prove that NPRL can
theoretically alleviate the rare event problem. Our empirical study using data
from a level-1 trauma center further demonstrates the effectiveness of our
proposal.

point in the execution where the actual behavior diverges from the desired
behavior. For example, a variable may get assigned a wrong value, which then
negatively influences the remaining computation. Once a developer identifies
such a divergence, how to fix the code so that it provides the desired
behavior? This paper presents TraceFixer, a technique for predicting how to
edit source code so that it does not diverge from the expected behavior
anymore. The key idea is to train a neural program repair model that not only
learns from source code edits but also exploits excerpts of runtime traces. The
input to the model is a partial execution trace of the incorrect code, which
can be obtained automatically through code instrumentation, and the correct
state that the program should reach at the divergence point, which the user
provides, e.g., in an interactive debugger. Our approach fundamentally differs
from current program repair techniques, which share a similar goal but exploit
neither execution traces nor information about the desired program state. We
evaluate TraceFixer on single-line mistakes in Python code. After training the
model on hundreds of thousands of code edits created by a neural model that
mimics real-world bugs, we find that exploiting execution traces improves the
bug-fixing ability by 13% to 20% (depending on the dataset, within the top-10
predictions) compared to a baseline that learns from source code edits only.
Applying TraceFixer to 20 real-world Python bugs shows that the approach
successfully fixes 10 of them.

node pairs until all node pairs are found. In designing Grad-Align+, we account
for how to augment node features in the sense of performing the NA task and how
to design our NA method by maximally exploiting the augmented node features. To
achieve this goal, we develop Grad-Align+ consisting of three key components:
1) centrality-based node feature augmentation (CNFA), 2) graph neural network
(GNN)-aided embedding similarity calculation alongside the augmented node
features, and 3) gradual NA with similarity calculation using the information
of aligned cross-network neighbor-pairs (ACNs). Through comprehensive
experiments, we demonstrate that Grad-Align+ exhibits (a) the superiority over
benchmark NA methods by a large margin, (b) empirical validations as well as
our theoretical findings to see the effectiveness of CNFA, (c) the influence of
each component, (d) the robustness to network noises, and (e) the computational
efficiency.

sub-Neptunes, unexplained by simulations so far. We utilize N-body simulations
including pebble and gas accretion as well as planetary migration to
investigate how the gas accretion rates influence the formation of systems of
inner sub-Neptunes and outer gas giants as well as the eccentricity
distribution of the outer giant planets. Less efficient envelope contraction
rates allow a more efficient formation of systems with inner sub-Neptunes and
outer giants. This is caused by the fact that the cores formed in the inner
disc are too small to accrete large envelopes and only cores growing in the
outer disc can become giants. As a result, instabilities between the outer
giant planets do not necessarily destroy the inner systems of sub-Neptunes
unlike simulations where giant planets can form closer in. Our simulations show
that up to 50% of the systems of cold Jupiters could have inner sub-Neptunes,
in agreement with observations. Our simulations show a good agreement with the
eccentricity distribution of giants, even though we find a slight mismatch to
the mass and semi-major axes distributions. Synthetic transit observations of
the inner systems (r<0.7 AU) reveal an excellent match to the Kepler
observations, where our simulations match the period ratios of adjacent planet
pairs. Thus, the breaking the chains model for super-Earth and sub-Neptune
formation remains consistent with observations even when outer giant planets
are present. However, simulations with outer giant planets produce more systems
with mostly only one inner planet and with larger eccentricities, in contrast
to simulations without outer giants. We thus predict that systems with truly
single close-in planets are more likely to host outer gas giants and we
consequently suggest RV follow-up observations of these systems to constrain
the formation pathway.

$\Phi_t\colon \Omega\to\Omega$ is holomorphic for every $t\ge 0$,
$\Phi_0(z)=z$, for every $z\in\Omega$, $\Phi_t\circ\Phi_s=\Phi_{s+t}$, for

convergence on compact subsets, P. Gumenyuk proved in 2014 that, when $\Omega$
is the unit disc, the convergence is uniform on the whole $\mathbb D$. When
$\Omega$ is a half-plane, it is not difficult to show that the result is no

  In this paper, we enhance Gumenyuk's result by proving that for every
continuous semigroup $\{\Phi_t \}_{t\ge 0}$ on $\mathbb D$ we have $$
\sup_{z\in\mathbb D} |\Phi_t(z)-z|= O(\sqrt t), \quad t\to 0^+. $$ In addition,
we provide an example showing that $O(\sqrt t)$ is the best possible rate of
uniform convergence valid for all semigroups on $\mathbb D$.
  When $\Omega$ is a half-plane we prove that there is uniform convergence to
the identity under certain boundedness conditions on the infinitesimal
generator of the semigroup. These boundedness conditions are fulfilled when the
semigroup $\{\Phi_t \}_{t\ge 0}$ is included in the Gordon-Hedenmalm class (the
one which produces bounded composition operators on Hardy spaces of Dirichlet
series). An important ingredient in the proofs of these results is the use of
harmonic measures, which we have done through a classic result of M.

By rewriting neuronal dynamics without reset to a general formulation, we

To avoid the use of future inputs for step-by-step inference, the weights of

sequences of varying lengths. We evaluate the PSN family on simulation speed
and temporal/static data classification, and the results show the overwhelming
advantage of the PSN family in efficiency and accuracy. To the best of our

cooperative driving applications. Sensors are able to detect objects in the
surrounding environment and information such as their current location is
exchanged among vehicles. In order to cope with the vehicles' mobility, such
information is required to be as fresh as possible for proper operation of
cooperative driving applications. The age of information (AoI) has been
proposed as a metric for evaluating freshness of information; recently also
within the context of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). We investigate
mechanisms to reduce the AoI of data transported in form of beacon messages
while controlling their emission rate. We aim to balance packet collision
probability and beacon frequency using the average peak age of information
(PAoI) as a metric. This metric, however, only accounts for the generation time
of the data but not for application-specific aspects, such as the location of
the transmitting vehicle. We thus propose a new way of interpreting the AoI by
considering information context; thereby incorporating vehicles' locations. As
an example, we characterize such importance using the orientation and the
distance of the involved vehicles. In particular, we introduce a weighting
coefficient used in combination with the PAoI to evaluate the information
freshness; emphasizing on information from more important neighbors. We further
design the beaconing approach in a way to meet a given AoI requirement, thus,
saving resources on the wireless channel while keeping the AoI minimal. We
illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in Manhattan-like urban scenarios;
reaching pre-specified targets for the AoI of beacon messages.

optimal number of such queries, as a function of both$\epsilon$ and $K$, is not
known.We make progress on this question on two fronts. First, we fully
characterise the query complexity of learning exact equilibria ($\epsilon=0$),
by showing that they require a number of queries that is linearin $K$, which
means that it is essentially as hard as querying the wholematrix, which can
also be done with $K$ queries. Second, for $\epsilon > 0$, the currentquery
complexity upper bound stands at $O(\min(\ln(K) / \epsilon , K))$. We argue
that, unfortunately, obtaining matchinglower bound is not possible with
existing techniques: we prove that nolower bound can be derived by constructing
hard matrices whose entriestake values in a known countable set, because such
matrices can be fullyidentified by a single query. This rules out, for
instance, reducing toa submodular optimization problem over the hypercube by
encoding itas a binary matrix. We then introduce a new technique for lower
bounds,which allows us to obtain lower bounds of order$\tilde\Omega(\log(1 /

have experienced enormous success over the past decades. However, in practice,
they suffer from a problem called posterior collapse, which occurs when the
encoder coincides, or collapses, with the prior taking no information from the
latent structure of the input data into consideration. In this work, we
introduce an inverse Lipschitz neural network into the decoder and, based on
this architecture, provide a new method that can control in a simple and clear
manner the degree of posterior collapse for a wide range of VAE models equipped
with a concrete theoretical guarantee. We also illustrate the effectiveness of
our method through several numerical experiments.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.DC cs.ET","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop a framework for self-induced phase changes in programmable matter
in which a collection of agents with limited computational and communication
capabilities can collectively perform appropriate global tasks in response to
local stimuli that dynamically appear and disappear. Agents reside on graph
vertices, where each stimulus is only recognized locally, and agents
communicate via token passing along edges to alert other agents to transition
to an ""aware"" state when stimuli are present and an ""unaware"" state when the
stimuli disappear. We present an Adaptive Stimuli Algorithm that is robust to
competing waves of messages as multiple stimuli change, possibly adversarially.
Moreover, in addition to handling arbitrary stimulus dynamics, the algorithm
can handle agents reconfiguring the connections (edges) of the graph over time
in a controlled way.
  As an application, we show how this Adaptive Stimuli Algorithm on
reconfigurable graphs can be used to solve the foraging problem, where food
sources may be discovered, removed, or shifted at arbitrary times. We would
like the agents to consistently self-organize using only local interactions,
such that if the food remains in position long enough, the agents transition to
a gather phase, collectively forming a single large component with small
perimeter around the food. Alternatively, if no food source has existed
recently, the agents should self-induce a switch to a search phase in which
they distribute themselves randomly throughout the lattice region to search for
food. Unlike previous approaches to foraging, this process is indefinitely
repeatable. Like a physical phase change, microscopic changes such as the
deletion or addition of a single food source triggers these macroscopic,
system-wide transitions as agents share information about the environment and
respond locally to get the desired collective response.

adaptable to abnormality. This requirement entails distribution system
operators (DSOs) to optimize restoration to normal operational states
dynamically. However, these design challenges demand collaborative research
efforts on sophisticated modeling and simulation approaches. Approach: In the
ESOSEG research project, analyzing the smart grid domain as a
software-intensive system, we employed a dynamic architecture approach,
particularly the FOCUS theory, to model and assure the domains' self-healing
requirements. Although some works specify various self-healing systems, to the
best of our knowledge, the use of the approach in smart grids is the first work
to enable a formal specification and verification of self-healing properties in
smart grids. Results: As a result, to support the modeling and verification
process, we developed tool support with Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF),
Xtext, and other languages in the EMF ecosystem. The tool includes a grammar or
a meta-model of the DSL, an interface to enable textual and graphical modeling
of architectural patterns and code transformer engine for verification.
Furthermore, we evaluated the modeling and verification features of the tool
support with an e-Car charging scenario for modeling adaptive self-healing
properties. Futureworks: As an outlook, future works could include
investigation of comprehensive case studies. These, for instance, could be
further particular adaptability scenarios addressing challenges in DSOs.
Another interesting aspect could be the evaluation of the modeling approach by
investigating its use with engineers involved in a smart grid design. Next, the
evaluation could be followed with abstractions of the verification process to
make it useable by system architects with no knowledge of the proof language,
Isabelle/HOL.

that a simple binary phase mask can work with the spherical aberration
inevitably induced by thick sample inhomogeneities, to extend the DOF of a
single-molecule fluorescence microscope over more than 4 {\mu}m. The effect of
point-spread-function (PSF) engineering over spherical aberration regularizes
inhomogeneities of the PSF along the optical axis by restricting it to a narrow
distribution. This allows the use of a single fitting function (i.e. Gaussian
function) to localize single emitters over the whole extended DOF. Application
of this simple approach on diffusing nanoparticles demonstrate that SPT
trajectories can be recorded on significantly longer times.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments, namely Reward-Weighted (R-Weighted)
and Loss-Weighted (L-Weighted) gradient merger. The R/L weighted methods
replace standard practices for training multiple agents, such as summing or
averaging the gradients. The core of our methods is to scale the gradient of
each actor based on how high the reward (for R-Weighted) or the loss (for
L-Weighted) is compared to the other actors. During training, each agent
operates in differently initialized versions of the same environment, which
gives different gradients from different actors. In essence, the R-Weights and
L-Weights of each agent inform the other agents of its potential, which again
reports which environment should be prioritized for learning. This approach of
distributed learning is possible because environments that yield higher
rewards, or low losses, have more critical information than environments that
yield lower rewards or higher losses. We empirically demonstrate that the
R-Weighted methods work superior to the state-of-the-art in multiple RL

separation of clutter, flow and noise in high frame rate ultrasound flow
imaging. The use of SVD as a clutter filter has greatly improved techniques
such as vector flow imaging, functional ultrasound and super-resolution
ultrasound localization microscopy. The removal of clutter and noise relies on
the assumption that tissue, flow and noise are each represented by different
subsets of singular values, so that their signals are uncorrelated and lay on
orthogonal sub-spaces. This assumption fails in the presence of tissue motion,
for near-wall or microvascular flow, and can be influenced by an incorrect
choice of singular value thresholds. Consequently, separation of flow, clutter
and noise is imperfect, which can lead to image artefacts not present in the
original data. Temporal and spatial fluctuation in intensity are the commonest
artefacts, which vary in appearance and strengths. Ghosting and splitting
artefacts are observed in the microvasculature where the flow signal is
sparsely distributed. Singular value threshold selection, tissue motion, frame
rate, flow signal amplitude and acquisition length affect the prevalence of
these artefacts. Understanding what causes artefacts due to SVD clutter and
noise removal is necessary for their interpretation.

accreting solids until they are massive enough to accrete gas. For giant planet
formation this means that a massive core must form within the lifetime of the
gas disk. The accretion of roughly km-sized planetesimals and the accretion of
mm-cm sized pebbles are typically discussed separately as the main solid
accretion mechanisms. We investigate the interplay between the two accretion
processes in a disk containing both pebbles and planetesimals for planet
formation in general and in the context of giant planet formation specifically.
The goal is to disentangle and understand the fundamental interactions that
arise in such hybrid pebble-planetesimal models. We combine a simple model of
pebble formation and accretion with a global model of planet formation which
considers the accretion of planetesimals. We compare synthetic populations of
planets formed in disks composed of different amounts of pebbles and 600 meter
sized planetesimals. On a system-level, we study the formation pathway of giant
planets in these disks. We find that, in hybrid disks containing both pebbles
and planetesimals, the formation of giant planets is strongly suppressed
whereas in a pebbles-only or planetesimals-only scenario, giant planets can
form. We identify the heating associated with the accretion of up to 100 km
sized planetesimals after the pebble accretion period to delay the runaway gas
accretion of massive cores. Coupled with strong inward type-I migration acting
on these planets, this results in close-in icy sub-Neptunes originating from
the outer disk. We conclude that, in hybrid pebble-planetesimal scenarios, the
late accretion of planetesimals is a critical factor in the giant planet
formation process and that inward migration is more efficient for planets in
increasingly pebble dominated disks.

nm wide GNR is examined electrically and optically (armchair and zigzag), with
the latter method being a check on the quality of the GNR devices and the

`Expand-and-Cluster' that needs only the number of hidden layers and the
activation function of the probed ANN to identify all network parameters. In
the expansion phase, we train a series of networks of increasing size using the
probed data of the ANN as a teacher. Expansion stops when a minimal loss is
consistently reached in networks of a given size. In the clustering phase,
weight vectors of the expanded students are clustered, which allows structured
pruning of superfluous neurons in a principled way. We find that an
overparameterization of a factor four is sufficient to reliably identify the
minimal number of neurons and to retrieve the original network parameters in
$80\%$ of tasks across a family of 150 toy problems of variable difficulty.
Furthermore, shallow and deep teacher networks trained on MNIST data can be
identified with less than $5\%$ overhead in the neuron number. Thus, while
direct training of a student network with a size identical to that of the
teacher is practically impossible because of the highly non-convex loss
function, training with mild overparameterization followed by clustering and
structured pruning correctly identifies the target network.

for combinatorial optimization problems, which are often formulated as
ground-state (lowest-energy) search problems of the Ising model. Since the
bit-width of coefficients on Ising machines is limited, the Ising model must be
transformed into the Ising model with the bit-width reduced to correspond to a
specific Ising machine. One bit-width reduction method adds auxiliary spins to
transform into a bit-width reduced (BWR) Ising model in which the ground states
are theoretically the same as those of the Ising model before bit-width
reduction (original Ising model). Herein we compare the dynamical processes of
the original Ising model and the BWR Ising model via the bit-width reduction
method. Simulated annealing (SA) shows that the dynamical process differs
significantly by model. Analysis from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics
found that the BWR Ising model with added auxiliary spins has two
characteristic properties: an effective temperature and a slow relaxation.
These properties are derived from the entropy effects of the auxiliary spins,
which are not present in the original Ising model. Moreover, to obtain the same
dynamical process as the original Ising model, we proposed SA parameters for
the BWR Ising model. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the dynamical
process of the BWR Ising model with the proposed SA parameters are close to
that of the original Ising model.

Shannon information theory by proposing a novel quantity, namely troenpy.
Troenpy measures the certainty, commonness and similarity of the underlying
distribution. To demonstrate its usefulness, we propose a troenpy based
weighting scheme for document with class labels, namely positive class
frequency (PCF). On a collection of public datasets we show the PCF based
weighting scheme outperforms the classical TF-IDF and a popular Optimal
Transportation based word moving distance algorithm in a kNN setting. We
further developed a new odds-ratio type feature, namely Expected Class
Information Bias(ECIB), which can be regarded as the expected odds ratio of the
information quantity entropy and troenpy. In the experiments we observe that
including the new ECIB features and simple binary term features in a simple
logistic regression model can further significantly improve the performance.
The simple new weighting scheme and ECIB features are very effective and can be
computed with linear order complexity.

experimentally measured strength of the polymer network is orders of magnitude
lower than the strength of covalent bonds. We investigate the effect of
statistical variation of the number of links in polymer chains on strength
using a parallel chain model. Each polymer chain is represented by a
freely-jointed chain, with a characteristic J-shaped force-extension curve. The
chain carries entropic forces for most of the extension and carries covalent
forces only for a narrow range of extension. The entropic forces are orders of
magnitude lower than the covalent forces. Chains with a statistical
distribution of the number of links per chain are pulled between two rigid
parallel plates. Chains with fewer links attain covalent forces and rupture at
smaller extensions, while chains with more links still carry entropic forces.
We compute the applied force on the rigid plates as a function of extension and
define the strength of the parallel chain model by the maximum force divided by
the total number of chains. With the J-shaped force-extension curve of each
chain, even a small scatter in the number of links per chain greatly reduces
the strength of the parallel chain model. We further show that the strength of
the parallel chain model relates to the scatter in the number of links per
chain according to a power law.

model traffic flow and assign Social Value Orientation (SVO) as context. We
then adopt a two-stage framework. In Stage 1, each agent in our socially-aware
traffic flow is driven by a hierarchical policy where upper-level policy
communicates genuine SVOs of all agents, which the lower-level policy takes as
input. In Stage 2, each agent in the socially adversarial traffic flow is
driven by the hierarchical policy where upper-level communicates mistaken SVOs,
taken by the lower-level policy trained in Stage 1. Driving policy is
adversarially trained through a zero-sum game formulation with upper-level

determines the fate of the binary after the merger: a prompt collapse to black

survives up to a few seconds before collapsing to a black hole. Determining the
evolution of a binary neutron star system will therefore place strong
constraints on the equation of state. We present a morphology-independent
method, developed in the framework of the coherentWaveBurst analysis of signals
from ground-based interferometric detectors of gravitational waves. The method
characterizes the time-frequency postmerger gravitational-wave emission from a

following quantities to characterize the postmerger emission: ratio of signal
energies and match of luminosity profile in different frequency bands, weighted
central frequency and bandwidth. From these quantities, based on the study of

build a statistics to discriminate between the different scenarios after the

vary with urban features and the opportunities for human interactions, but it
might also differ according to the underlying social conditions of city
inhabitants across and within social surroundings. Such heterogeneity in how
different demographic groups may experience cities has the potential to cause
gender segregation because of differences in the preferences of inhabitants,
their accessibility and opportunities, and large-scale mobility behaviours.
However, traditional studies have failed to capture fully a high-frequency
understanding of how urban vibrancy is linked to urban features, how this might
differ for different genders, and how this might affect segregation in cities.
Our results show that (1) there are differences between males and females in
terms of urban vibrancy, (2) the differences relate to `Points of Interest` as
well as transportation networks, and (3) that there are both positive and
negative `spatial spillovers` existing across each city. To do this, we use a
quantitative approach using Call Detail Record data--taking advantage of the
near-ubiquitous use of mobile phones--to gain high-frequency observations of
spatial behaviours across the seven most prominent cities of Italy. We use a

important direction to unravel the spin puzzle in hadronic physics. To include
spin degrees of freedom in the small $x$ regime requires going beyond the usual
eikonal approximation in high energy QCD. We developed an effective Hamiltonian
approach to study spin related observables in the small $x$ regime using the
shockwave formalism. The small-$x$ effective Hamiltonian incorporates both
quark and gluon propagators in the background fields and the background field
induced interaction vertices up to next-to-eikonal order. A novel feature of
sub-eikonal interactions is the background gluon field induced gluon radiation
inside the shockwave. Its relation to chromo-electrically polarized Wilson line
correlator is established both in small $x$ helicity evolution and in
longitudinal double-spin asymmetry for gluon production.

been developed to tag a boosted top quark in its hadronic decay channel.
Recently tagging the same in the semi-leptonic channel has begun to receive a
lot of attention. In the current study, we develop a methodology to tag a
boosted top quark ($p_T>$ 200 GeV) in its semi-leptonic decay channel with a
$\tau$-lepton in the final state. In this analysis, the constituents of the top
fatjet are reclustered using jet substructure technique to obtain the subjets,
and then $b$- and $\tau$- like subjets are identified by applying standard $b$-

background can be rejected effectively using several kinematic variables of
these subjects, such as energy sharing among the jets, invariant mass,
transverse mass, Nsubjettiness etc., leading to high signal tagging

employing multivariate analysis techniques. We find that using this proposed
top-tagger, a signal efficiency of $\sim 77\%$ against a background efficiency
of $\sim 3\%$ can be achieved. We also extend the proposed top-tagger to the

major challenges to achieve macroscopic coherent spin currents and realistic
spintronic or valleytronic devices, specifically at room temperature, where
strong thermal fluctuations could further obscure the spin flow. Exciton
polaritons in semiconductor microcavities being the quantum superposition of
excitons and photons, are believed to be promising platforms for spin-dependent
optoelectronic or, in short, spin-optronic devices. Long-range spin current
flows of exciton polaritons may be controlled through the optical spin Hall

from programming errors. Explicit programming errors usually manifest through
error messages and stack traces. These stack traces describe the chain of
function calls that lead to an anomalous situation, or exception. Indeed, these
exceptions may cross the entire software stack (including applications and
libraries). Thus, studying the patterns in stack traces can help practitioners
and researchers understand the causes of exceptions in ML applications and the
challenges faced by ML developers. To that end, we mine Stack Overflow (SO) and
study 11,449 stack traces related to seven popular Python ML libraries. First,
we observe that ML questions that contain stack traces gain more popularity
than questions without stack traces; however, they are less likely to get
accepted answers. Second, we observe that recurrent patterns exists in ML stack
traces, even across different ML libraries, with a small portion of patterns
covering many stack traces. Third, we derive five high-level categories and 25
low-level types from the stack trace patterns: most patterns are related to
python basic syntax, model training, parallelization, data transformation, and
subprocess invocation. Furthermore, the patterns related to subprocess
invocation, external module execution, and remote API call are among the least

experiments have shown that global differences persist even between

in the densities of donor/acceptor sites. We develop an analytical model,
backed by numerical simulations, that smoothly connects the global and
deterministic charge transfer of different materials to the local and
stochastic mosaic picture normally associated with identical materials. Going
further, we extend our model to explain the effect of contact asymmetries

important influence in the tropics and beyond; however, many of its
characteristics are poorly understood, including their initiation and
completion. Here we define Madden-Julian events as the contiguous time periods
with an active MJO, and we show that both the durations and the sizes of these
events are well described by a double power-law distribution. Thus, small
events have no characteristic scale, and the same for large events;
nevertheless, both types of events are separated by a characteristic duration
of about 27 days (this corresponds to half a cycle, roughly). Thus, after 27
days, there is a sharp increase in the probability that an event gets extinct.
We find that this effect is independent of the starting and ending phases of
the events, which seems to point to an internal mechanism of exhaustion rather
than to the effect of an external barrier. Our results would imply an important
limitation of the MJO as a driver of sub-seasonal predictability.

backpropagating errors, and updating weights. This is inherently required by
the learning algorithm since the gradient descent learning rule relies on the
chain product of partial derivatives. However, it is challenging to implement
deep learning in hardware systems that use noisy analog memristors as
artificial synapses, as well as not being biologically plausible.
Memristor-based implementations generally result in an excessive cost of
neuronal circuits and stringent demands for idealized synaptic devices. Here,
we demonstrate that the requirement for high precision is not necessary and
that more efficient deep learning can be achieved when this requirement is
lifted. We propose a binary stochastic learning algorithm that modifies all
elementary neural network operations, by introducing (i) stochastic
binarization of both the forwarding signals and the activation function
derivatives, (ii) signed binarization of the backpropagating errors, and (iii)
step-wised weight updates. Through an extensive hybrid approach of software
simulation and hardware experiments, we find that binary stochastic deep
learning systems can provide better performance than the software-based
benchmarks using the high-precision learning algorithm. Also, the binary
stochastic algorithm strongly simplifies the neural network operations in
hardware, resulting in an improvement of the energy efficiency for the
multiply-and-accumulate operations by more than three orders of magnitudes.

annealing, a promising framework for quantum computing that may provide a
quantum advantage for certain tasks. Quantum annealing involves letting a
quantum system evolve according to the Schr\""odinger equation, with the goal of
obtaining the optimal solution to an optimization problem through measurements
of the final state. However, the continuous nature of quantum annealing makes
analytical analysis challenging, particularly with regard to the instantaneous
eigenenergies. The adiabatic theorem provides a theoretical result for the
annealing time required to obtain the optimal solution with high probability,
which is inversely proportional to the square of the minimum spectral gap.
Avoided level crossings can create exponentially closing gaps, which can lead
to exponentially long running times for optimization problems. In this paper,
we use a perturbative expansion to derive a condition for the occurrence of an
avoided level crossing during the annealing process. We then apply this
condition to the MaxCut problem on bipartite graphs. We show that no
exponentially small gaps arise for regular bipartite graphs, implying that QA
can efficiently solve MaxCut in that case. On the other hand, we show that
irregularities in the vertex degrees can lead to the satisfaction of the
avoided level crossing occurrence condition. We provide numerical evidence to
support this theoretical development, and discuss the relation between the
presence of exponentially closing gaps and the failure of quantum annealing.

The orbital and magnetic properties of the system imply that the magnetospheres
overlap at all orbital phases, suggesting the possibility of variable
inter-star magnetospheric interaction due to the non-negligible eccentricity of
the orbit. To investigate this effect, we observed the X-ray emission from
$\epsilon$ Lupi both near and away from periastron passage, using the Neutron
Star Interior Composition Explorer mission (NICER) X-ray Telescope. We find
that the system produces excess X-ray emission at the periastron phase,
suggesting the presence of variable inter-star magnetospheric interaction. We
also discover that the enhancement at periastron is confined to a very narrow
orbital phase range ($\approx 5\%$ of the orbital period), but the X-ray
properties close to periastron phase are similar to those observed away from
periastron. From these observations, we infer that the underlying cause is
magnetic reconnection heating the stellar wind plasma, rather than shocks
produced by wind-wind collision. Finally, by comparing the behavior of
$\epsilon$ Lupi with that observed for cooler magnetic binary systems, we
propose that elevated X-ray flux at periastron phase is likely a general

the width of the twist wall around the skyrmion's core. The width evolves in a

originating from the decay of a neutral long-lived particle (LLP) and
reconstructed in the decay modes $H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ and $Z\rightarrow
ee$. The analysis uses the full Run 2 data set of proton$-$proton collisions
delivered by the LHC at an energy of $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV between 2015 and 2018
and recorded by the ATLAS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity
of 139 fb$^{-1}$. Exploiting the capabilities of the ATLAS liquid argon
calorimeter to precisely measure the arrival times and trajectories of
electromagnetic objects, the analysis searches for the signature of pairs of
photons or electrons which arise from a common displaced vertex and which
arrive after some delay at the calorimeter. The results are interpreted in a
gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking model with pair-produced higgsinos that
decay to LLPs, and each LLP subsequently decays into either a Higgs boson or a
$Z$ boson. The final state includes at least two particles that escape direct
detection, giving rise to missing transverse momentum. No significant excess is
observed above the background expectation. The results are used to set upper
limits on the cross section for higgsino pair production, up to a
$\tilde\chi^0_1$ mass of 369 (704) GeV for decays with 100% branching ratio of
$\tilde\chi^0_1$ to Higgs ($Z$) bosons for a $\tilde\chi^0_1$ lifetime of 2 ns.
A model-independent limit is also set on the production of pairs of photons or
electrons with a significant delay in arrival at the calorimeter.

  benefit from general coverage conditions?","Accepted by ICML 2023",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In online reinforcement learning (RL), instead of employing standard
structural assumptions on Markov decision processes (MDPs), using a certain
coverage condition (original from offline RL) is enough to ensure
sample-efficient guarantees (Xie et al. 2023). In this work, we focus on this
new direction by digging more possible and general coverage conditions, and
study the potential and the utility of them in efficient online RL. We identify
more concepts, including the $L^p$ variant of concentrability, the density
ratio realizability, and trade-off on the partial/rest coverage condition, that
can be also beneficial to sample-efficient online RL, achieving improved regret
bound. Furthermore, if exploratory offline data are used, under our coverage
conditions, both statistically and computationally efficient guarantees can be
achieved for online RL. Besides, even though the MDP structure is given, e.g.,
linear MDP, we elucidate that, good coverage conditions are still beneficial to
obtain faster regret bound beyond $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ and even a
logarithmic order regret. These results provide a good justification for the
usage of general coverage conditions in efficient online RL.

  Adversarial Debiasing",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Evidence-aware fake news detection aims to conduct reasoning between news and
evidence, which is retrieved based on news content, to find uniformity or
inconsistency. However, we find evidence-aware detection models suffer from
biases, i.e., spurious correlations between news/evidence contents and
true/fake news labels, and are hard to be generalized to Out-Of-Distribution
(OOD) situations. To deal with this, we propose a novel Dual Adversarial
Learning (DAL) approach. We incorporate news-aspect and evidence-aspect
debiasing discriminators, whose targets are both true/fake news labels, in DAL.
Then, DAL reversely optimizes news-aspect and evidence-aspect debiasing
discriminators to mitigate the impact of news and evidence content biases. At
the same time, DAL also optimizes the main fake news predictor, so that the
news-evidence interaction module can be learned. This process allows us to
teach evidence-aware fake news detection models to better conduct news-evidence
reasoning, and minimize the impact of content biases. To be noted, our proposed
DAL approach is a plug-and-play module that works well with existing backbones.
We conduct comprehensive experiments under two OOD settings, and plug DAL in
four evidence-aware fake news detection backbones. Results demonstrate that,
DAL significantly and stably outperforms the original backbones and some
competitive debiasing methods.

Each blockchain node hosts an SGX-enabled processor that securely performs the
FL-based aggregation tasks to generate a global model. Blockchain nodes can
verify the authenticity of the aggregated model, run a blockchain consensus
mechanism to ensure the integrity of the model, and add it to the distributed

that does not require fully sampled k-space data.
  METHODS: ReSiDe is inspired by plug-and-play (PnP) methods and employs a
denoiser as a regularizer. In contrast to traditional PnP approaches that
utilize generic denoisers or train deep learning-based denoisers using
high-quality images or image patches, ReSiDe directly trains the denoiser on
the image or images being reconstructed from the undersampled data. We
introduce two variations of our method, ReSiDe-S and ReSiDe-M. ReSiDe-S is
scan-specific and works with a single set of undersampled measurements, while
ReSiDe-M operates on multiple sets of undersampled measurements. More
importantly, the trained denoisers in ReSiDe-M are stored for PnP recovery
without further training. To improve robustness, the denoising strength in
ReSiDe-S and ReSiDe- M is auto-tuned using the discrepancy principle.
  RESULTS: Studies I, II, and III compare ReSiDe-S and ReSiDe-M against other
self-supervised or unsupervised methods using data from T1- and T2-weighted
brain MRI, MRXCAT digital perfusion phantom, and first-pass cardiac perfusion,
respectively. ReSiDe-S and ReSiDe-M outperform other methods in terms of
reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure
for Studies I and II and in terms of expert scoring for Study III.
  CONCLUSION: A self-supervised image reconstruction method is presented and
validated in both static and dynamic MRI applications. These developments can
benefit MRI applications where availability of fully sampled training data is
limited.

LDM is more stable and requires less computation to train than GANs, albeit
with more computationally expensive generation. We benchmark it against the
GAN-based Deep Generative Models of Rainfall (DGMR) and a statistical model,
PySTEPS. The LDM produces more accurate precipitation predictions, while the
comparisons are more mixed when predicting whether the precipitation exceeds
predefined thresholds. The clearest advantage of the LDM is that it generates
more diverse predictions than DGMR or PySTEPS. Rank distribution tests indicate
that the distribution of samples from the LDM accurately reflects the
uncertainty of the predictions. Thus, LDMs are promising for any applications
where uncertainty quantification is important, such as weather and climate.

outbursts in 1938, 1989, and 2015. During these events, it has been possible to
determine relevant data of the system; such as the masses of the compact object
(a black hole, BH) and its companion, the orbital period, the companion
spectral type, and luminosity class, among others. Remarkably, the companion
star has a metallicity appreciably higher than solar. All these data allow us
to construct theoretical models to account for its structure, looking for its
initial configuration and predicting its final fate. Assuming that the BH is
already formed when the primary star reaches the Zero Age Main Sequence, we
used our binary evolution code for such a purpose. We obtained that the present
characteristics of the system are nicely accounted for by a model with initial
masses of 9 solar masses for the BH, 1.5 solar masses for the companion star,
an initial orbital period of 1.5 d and considering that at most 30% of the mass
transferred by the donor is accreted by the BH. The metallicity of the donor
for our best fit was Z = 0.028 (twice solar metallicity). We also studied the
evolution of the BH spin parameter assuming that initially, it is not rotating.
Remarkably, the spin of the BHs in our models is far from reaching the
available observational determination. This may indicate that the BH in V404
Cyg is initially spinning, a result that may be relevant for understanding the
formation BHs in the context of LMXB systems.

game thus captures the tension between resource pooling (to benefit from the
resulting statistical economies of scale) and competition between coalitions
over market share. In a departure from the prior literature on resource pooling
for congestible services, we show that the grand coalition is in general not
stable, once we allow for competition over market share. In fact, under
classical notions of stability (defined via blocking by any coalition), we show
that no partition is stable. This motivates us to introduce more restricted
(and relevant) notions of blocking; interestingly, we find that the stable
configurations under these novel notions of stability are duopolies, where the
dominant coalition exploits its economies of scale to corner a disproportionate
market share. Furthermore, we completely characterise the stable duopolies in

bosons (e.g. dark photon) arising from various $U(1)$ extensions of the
standard model. It is known that the dark photon production rate is suppressed
by the dark photon mass if it is well below the plasmon mass of the medium. We
show that for more general $U(1)$ gauge bosons, this suppression is absent if
the couplings are not in alignment with those of the photon. We investigate a
few frequently discussed $U(1)$ models including $B-L$, $L_{\mu}-L_{\tau}$, and
$L_{e}-L_{\mu(\tau)}$, and derive the stellar cooling bounds for these models.

optimization problems in robotics. While their resulting trajectories tend to
be dynamically accurate, they may also present large kinematic errors in the
case of constrained mechanical systems, i.e., those whose state coordinates are
subject to holonomic or nonholonomic constraints, like loop-closure or
rolling-contact constraints. These constraints confine the robot trajectories
to an implicitly-defined manifold, which complicates the computation of
accurate solutions. Discretization errors inherent to the transcription of the
problem easily make the trajectories drift away from this manifold, which
results in physically inconsistent motions that are difficult to track with a
controller. This paper reviews existing methods to deal with this problem and
proposes new ones to overcome their limitations. Current approaches either
disregard the kinematic constraints (which leads to drift accumulation) or
modify the system dynamics to keep the trajectory close to the manifold (which
adds artificial forces or energy dissipation to the system). The methods we
propose, in contrast, achieve full drift elimination on the discrete
trajectory, or even along the continuous one, without artificial modifications
of the system dynamics. We illustrate and compare the methods using various
examples of different complexity.

However, two fundamental problems exist with the conventional scheme of EP
encircling: the speed of mode conversion is restricted by the adiabatic
requirement, and the chirality cannot be freely controlled. We introduce a
method for dynamically engineering adiabaticity in the evolution of
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that allows for both chiral and non-chiral mode
conversion on the same path. Our method is based on quantifying and controlling
the instantaneous adiabaticity, allowing for non-uniform evolution throughout
the entire path. By optimizing the evolution based on the distributed nature of
adiabaticity, we achieve the same quality as conventional quasi-adiabatic
evolution in only one-third of the time. Our approach provides a comprehensive
and universal solution to address the speed and chirality challenges associated
with EP encircling. It also facilitates the dynamic manipulation and regulation
of non-adiabatic processes, thereby accelerating the operation and allowing for
a selection among various mode conversion patterns.

building blocks that have possibly formed the Galactic halo. In this framework,
the enrichment from neutron star mergers can be influenced by the dynamics of
the binary systems in the gravitational potential of the original host galaxy.
In the least massive systems, the neutron stars can merge outside the host
galaxy and so only a small fraction of newly produced Eu can be retained by the
parent galaxy itself.\\ Results. In the framework of this new scenario, the
accreted merging neutron stars are able to explain the presence of stars with
sub-solar [Eu/Fe] ratios at [Fe/H]$\leq-3$, but only if we assume a delay time
distribution for merging of the neutron stars $\propto t^{-1.5}$. We confirm
the correlation between the dispersion of [Eu/Fe] at a given metallicity and
the fraction of massive stars which give origin to neutron star mergers. The
mixed scenario, where both neutron star mergers and magneto-rotational
supernovae do produce Eu, can explain the observed spread in the Eu abundance
also for a delay time distribution for mergers going either as $\propto t^{-1}$

during the Paleozoic era, whose method of locomotion is understudied. As a
baseline case, a flow over a smooth orthoconic model with a blunt cone end is
investigated numerically at Reynolds numbers from 500 to 1500. As Reynolds
increases, two different shedding mechanisms - hairpin-vortex wake and
spiral-vortex wake - are captured. We notice that an introduction of annulation
over the cone surface changes the critical Reynolds number for the transition
of the shedding mechanism. The dominant shedding frequency increases with the
Reynolds number for the smooth and annulated cone flows. Moreover, the
annulation reduces the dominant frequency for the same Reynolds number and
increases the time-averaged drag coefficient. Modal decompositions - Proper
Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
(SPOD) - are used to capture the coherent structures and their oscillating
frequencies. We have captured modes corresponding to the hairpin-vortex wake
and spiral-vortex wake shedding mechanisms. Comparing the leading POD modes for
the smooth and the annulated cone flows, we find that the annulation can reduce
the twisting effects of the coherent structures in the wake. Additionally, we
find that the SPOD analysis can identify modes presenting both hairpin-vortex
wake and spiral-vortex wake in one flow condition as leading modes, while the
POD leading modes only reveal one shedding mechanism in each flow.

small-disturbance equations with curved characteristic boundaries. We establish
the $L^1$--convergence estimate of these two solutions with the optimal
convergence rate, which justifies Van Dyke's similarity theory rigorously for
the compressible full Euler flows. This is the first mathematical result on the
comparison of two solutions of the compressible Euler equations with

special structures of the two systems and establish the global existence and
the $L^1$--stability of the entropy solutions under the smallness assumptions
on the total variation of both the initial data and the tangential slope of the
wedge boundary. Based on the $L^1$--stability properties of the approximate
solutions to the scaled equations with parameter $\tau$, a uniform Lipschtiz
continuous map with respect to the initial data and the wedge boundary is
obtained. Next, we compare the solutions given by the Riemann solvers of the
two systems by taking the boundary perturbations into account case by case.
Then, for a given fixed hypersonic similarity parameter, as the Mach number

abundance to appear in stellar spectra, detection of Th has to date been
tentative and based on just a few weak and blended lines. Here, we present
convincing evidence not only for the first Th detection in a magnetic
chemically peculiar Ap star but also for the first detection of Th III in a
stellar spectrum. CPD-62 2717 was initially recognized as a highly-magnetized
Ap star thanks to resolved magnetically split lines captured in $H$-band
spectra from the SDSS/APOGEE survey. The star was subsequently pinpointed as
extraordinarily peculiar when careful inspection of the $H$-band line content
revealed the presence of five lines of Th III, none of which are detected in
the other $\sim1500$ APOGEE-observed Ap stars. Follow-up with the VLT+UVES
confirmed a similarly peculiar optical spectrum featuring dozens of Th III
lines, among other peculiarities. Unlike past claims of Th detection, and owing
to high-resolution observations of the strong ($\sim$8$-$12$\,$kG) magnetic
field of CPD-62 2717, the detection of Th III can in this case be supported by
matches between the observed and theoretical magnetic splitting patterns.
Comparison of CPD-62 2717 to stars for which Th overabundances have been
previously reported (e.g., Przybylski's Star) indicate that only for CPD-62
2717 is the Th detection certain. Along with the focus on Th III, we use time
series measurements of the magnetic field modulus to constrain the rotation
period of CPD-62 2717 to $\sim$4.8 years, thus establishing it as a new example
of a super-slowly-rotating Ap star.

the dichroism of macular pigments held in Henle's fiber layer of the retina and
can be inhibited by retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration,
which alter the structure of the macula. Structured light tools enable the
direct probing of macular pigment density through the perception of
polarization-dependent entoptic patterns. Here, we directly measure the visual
angle of an entoptic pattern created through the illumination of the retina
with a structured state of light and a perception task that is insensitive to
corneal birefringence. The central region of the structured light stimuli was
obstructed, with the size of the obstruction varying according to a
psychophysical staircase. The perceived size of the entoptic pattern was
observed to vary between participants, with an average visual angle threshold
radius of $9.5^\circ \pm 0.9^\circ$, 95% C.I. = [$5.8^\circ$, $13^\circ$], in a
sample of healthy participants. These results (with eleven azimuthal fringes)
differ markedly from previous estimates of the Haidinger's brush phenomenon's
extant (two azimuthal fringes), of $3.75^\circ$, suggesting that higher
azimuthal fringe density increases pattern visibility. The increase in apparent
size and clarity of entoptic phenomenon produced by the presented structured
light stimuli may possess greater potential to detect the early signs of
macular disease over perception tasks using uniform polarization stimuli.

rotation rates predicted by asteroseismology and by starspots measurements for
four main-sequence stars from the Kepler LEGACY sample, considering different
AM transport prescriptions, and investigated if some of these prescriptions
could be ruled out.
  We decoupled the modelling of the structure and of the rotational profile,
respectively obtained by an asteroseismic characterization and by using
rotating models including a detailed treatment of the AM transport. We then
compared the mean asteroseismic rotation rate with the surface rotation rate
from starspots measurements for each of the AM transport prescriptions. In the
hotter part of the HRD (M > ~ 1.2Msun), combining asteroseismic constraints
from splittings of pressure modes and surface rotation rates does not allow to
conclude on the need for an efficient AM transport in addition to the sole
transport by meridional circulation and shear instability. Both prescriptions
are indeed consistent with the quasi-solid rotation measured by Benomar et al.
(2015) and Nielsen et al. (2017). In the colder part of the HRD, the situation
is different due to the efficient braking of the stellar surface by magnetised
winds. We find a clear disagreement between the rotational properties of models
including only hydrodynamic processes and asteroseismic constraints, while
models with magnetic fields correctly reproduce the observations, similarly to
the solar case.
  This shows the existence of a mass regime corresponding to main-sequence
stars around ~ 6000 - 6200 K for which it is difficult to constrain the AM
transport processes, unlike for hotter, Gamma Dor stars or colder, less massive
solar analogs.

underlying structure of their latent spaces is still poorly understood, thereby
making the task of performing semantically meaningful latent traversals an open

modeling latent structures linearly, and finding corresponding linear
directions which result in `disentangled' generations. In this work, we instead
propose to model latent structures with a learned dynamic potential landscape,
thereby performing latent traversals as the flow of samples down the
landscape's gradient. Inspired by physics, optimal transport, and neuroscience,
these potential landscapes are learned as physically realistic partial
differential equations, thereby allowing them to flexibly vary over both space
and time. To achieve disentanglement, multiple potentials are learned
simultaneously, and are constrained by a classifier to be distinct and
semantically self-consistent. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our method
achieves both more qualitatively and quantitatively disentangled trajectories
than state-of-the-art baselines. Further, we demonstrate that our method can be
integrated as a regularization term during training, thereby acting as an
inductive bias towards the learning of structured representations, ultimately
improving model likelihood on similarly structured data.

processes from computationally expensive storm-resolving models while retaining
many features at a fraction of computational cost. Yet, climate simulations
with embedded neural network parameterizations are still challenging and highly
depend on the deep learning solution. This is likely associated with spurious
non-physical correlations learned by the neural networks due to the complexity
of the physical dynamical system. Here, we show that the combination of
causality with deep learning helps removing spurious correlations and
optimizing the neural network algorithm. To resolve this, we apply a causal
discovery method to unveil key physical drivers in the set of input predictors
of atmospheric subgrid-scale processes of a superparameterized climate model in
which deep convection is explicitly resolved. The resulting causally-informed
neural networks are coupled to the climate model, hence, replacing the
superparameterization and radiation scheme. We show that the climate
simulations with causally-informed neural network parameterizations retain many
convection-related properties of the original high-resolution climate model and
clearly outperform the non-causal approach, while retaining similar
generalization capabilities to unseen climates. The combination of causal

analyzing SDEs, we identify the asymptotic behaviors of LPSA for different

asymptotic bias-variance trade-off and yields phase transition phenomenons,
according to the relative magnitude of $p_n$ w.r.t. $\eta_n$. This finding
provides insights on selecting appropriate ${(p_n, \eta_n)}_{n \geq 1}$ to
minimize the projection cost. Additionally, we propose the Debiased LPSA
(DLPSA) as a practical application of our jump diffusion approximation result.
DLPSA is shown to effectively reduce projection complexity compared to vanilla
LPSA.

IIn supernovae (SNe IIn). We find that after correcting for likely interstellar
polarization, SNe IIn commonly show intrinsic continuum polarization of 1--3%
at the time of peak optical luminosity, although a few show weaker or
negligible polarization. While some SNe IIn have even stronger polarization at
early times, their polarization tends to drop smoothly over several hundred
days after peak. We find a tendency for the intrinsic polarization to be
stronger at bluer wavelengths, especially at early times. While polarization
from an electron scattering region is expected to be grey, scattering of SN
light by dusty circumstellar material (CSM) may induce such a
wavelength-dependent polarization. For most SNe IIn, changes in polarization
degree and wavelength dependence are not accompanied by changes in the position
angle, requiring that asymmetric pre-SN mass loss had a persistent geometry.
While 2--3% polarization is typical, about 30% of SNe IIn have very low or
undetected polarization. Under the simplifying assumption that all SN IIn
progenitors have axisymmetric CSM (i.e. disk/torus/bipolar), then the
distribution of polarization values we observe is consistent with similarly
asymmetric CSM seen from a distribution of random viewing angles. This
asymmetry has very important implications for understanding the origin of
pre-SN mass loss in SNe IIn, suggesting that it was shaped by binary
interaction.

Non-symplectic nature of the transformation between the usual commutative space
and NCS restricts the straightforward use of Simon's condition in NCS. We have
transformed the NCS system to an equivalent Hamiltonian in commutative space
through the Bopp shift, which enables the utilization of the separability
criterion. To make our study fairly general and to analyze the effect of
parameters on the separability of bipartite state in NC-space, we have
considered a bilinear Hamiltonian with time-dependent (TD) parameters, along
with a TD external interaction, which is linear in field modes. The system is
transformed ($Sp(4,\mathbb{R})$) into canonical form keeping the intrinsic
symplectic structure intact. The solution of the TD-Schr\""{o}dinger equation is
obtained with the help of the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method (LRIM).
Expectation values of the observables (thus the covariance matrix ) are
constructed from the states obtained from LRIM. It turns out that the existence
of the anisotropy in the oscillator determines the separability of the states.
In particular, for an isotropic oscillator, the bipartite states are always
separable, whereas particular anisotropic parameter values may cease the
separability. Thus tuning the parameter values, one can destroy or recreate the
separability of states. With the help of a toy model, we have demonstrated how
the tuning of a TD- NCS parameter affects the separability.

deep learning methods represented by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

generate high-degree-of-freedom meta-atoms based on S-parameter requirements.
However, the adversarial training process of GANs makes the network unstable

the Markov process that transforms the original structure into a Gaussian

globally stable. The acquired results establish a threshold time limit for the
impulsive release of various controls as well as some valid theoretical
conclusions for effective pest management. Furthermore, after a numerical
comparison, we conclude that integrated pest management is more effective than
single biological or chemical controls. Finally, we illustrate the analytical
results through numerical simulations.

  Electrocatalysis","1 file, 20 pages, 15 figures",,,,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.atm-clus","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Electrocatalysis is a catalytic process where the rate of an electrochemical
reaction occurring at the electrode-electrolyte interface can be controlled by
varying the electrical potential. Electrocatalysis can be applied to generate
hydrogen which can be stored for future use in fuel cells for clean
electricity. The use of solid oxide in electrocatalysis specially in hydrogen
evolution reaction is promising. However, further improvements are essential in
order to meet the ever-increasing global energy demand. Improvement of the
performance of these high energy chemical systems is directly linked to the
understanding and improving the complex physical and chemical phenomena and
exchanges that take place at their different interfaces. To enable large length
and time scale atomistic simulations of solid oxide electrocatalysis for
hydrogen generation, we developed an eReaxFF force field for barium zirconate
doped with 20 mol% of yttrium (BZY20). All parameters for the eReaxFF were
optimized to reproduce quantum mechanical (QM) calculations on relevant
condensed phase and cluster systems describing oxygen vacancies, vacancy
migrations, water adsorption, water splitting and hydrogen generation on the
surfaces of the BZY20 solid oxide. Using the developed force field, we
performed zero-voltage molecular dynamics simulations to observe water
adsorption and the eventual hydrogen production. Based on our simulation
results, we conclude that this force field sets a stage for the introduction of
explicit electron concept in order to simulate electron conductivity, electron
leakage and non-zero-voltage effects on hydrogen generation. Overall, we
demonstrate how atomistic-scale simulations can enhance our understanding of
processes at interfaces in solid oxide materials.

  Investigating the Homophily Principle on Node Distinguishability",,,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Homophily principle, i.e. nodes with the same labels are more likely to be
connected, has been believed to be the main reason for the performance
superiority of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) over node-based Neural Networks on
Node Classification tasks. Recent research suggests that, even in the absence
of homophily, the advantage of GNNs still exists as long as nodes from the same
class share similar neighborhood patterns. However, this argument only
considers intra-class Node Distinguishability (ND) and neglects inter-class ND,
which provides incomplete understanding of homophily. In this paper, we first
demonstrate the aforementioned insufficiency with examples and argue that an
ideal situation for ND is to have smaller intra-class ND than inter-class ND.
To formulate this idea, we propose Contextual Stochastic Block Model for
Homophily (CSBM-H) and define two metrics, Probabilistic Bayes Error (PBE) and
negative generalized Jeffreys divergence, to quantify ND, through which we can
find how intra- and inter-class ND influence ND together. We visualize the
results and give detailed analysis. Through experiments, we verified that the
superiority of GNNs is indeed closely related to both intra- and inter-class ND
regardless of homophily levels, based on which we propose a new performance
metric beyond homophily, which is non-linear and feature-based. Experiments
indicate it significantly more effective than the existing homophily metrics on
revealing the advantage and disadvantage of GNNs on both synthetic and
benchmark real-world datasets.

extensive simulations for the case of Colombia, a country that consists mostly

hypothetical case where farmers perfectly know their farm's epidemiological
state and the weather in advance, any pandemic-related efforts can only amount
to a limited profit of roughly 4% on investment. In the more realistic case,
any pandemic-related efforts are expected to result in economic losses,

  Learning for Financial Marketing",,,,,"cs.IR cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-task learning for various real-world applications usually involves
tasks with logical sequential dependence. For example, in online marketing, the
cascade behavior pattern of $impression \rightarrow click \rightarrow
conversion$ is usually modeled as multiple tasks in a multi-task manner, where
the sequential dependence between tasks is simply connected with an explicitly
defined function or implicitly transferred information in current works. These
methods alleviate the data sparsity problem for long-path sequential tasks as
the positive feedback becomes sparser along with the task sequence. However,
the error accumulation and negative transfer will be a severe problem for
downstream tasks. Especially, at the beginning stage of training, the
optimization for parameters of former tasks is not converged yet, and thus the
information transferred to downstream tasks is negative. In this paper, we
propose a prior information merged model (\textbf{PIMM}), which explicitly
models the logical dependence among tasks with a novel prior information merged
(\textbf{PIM}) module for multiple sequential dependence task learning in a
curriculum manner. Specifically, the PIM randomly selects the true label
information or the prior task prediction with a soft sampling strategy to
transfer to the downstream task during the training. Following an
easy-to-difficult curriculum paradigm, we dynamically adjust the sampling
probability to ensure that the downstream task will get the effective
information along with the training. The offline experimental results on both
public and product datasets verify that PIMM outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines. Moreover, we deploy the PIMM in a large-scale FinTech platform, and
the online experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of PIMM.

  discovery",,,,,"q-bio.BM cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A central task in computational drug discovery is to construct models from
known active molecules to find further promising molecules for subsequent
screening. However, typically only very few active molecules are known.
Therefore, few-shot learning methods have the potential to improve the
effectiveness of this critical phase of the drug discovery process. We
introduce a new method for few-shot drug discovery. Its main idea is to enrich
a molecule representation by knowledge about known context or reference
molecules. Our novel concept for molecule representation enrichment is to
associate molecules from both the support set and the query set with a large
set of reference (context) molecules through a Modern Hopfield Network.
Intuitively, this enrichment step is analogous to a human expert who would
associate a given molecule with familiar molecules whose properties are known.
The enrichment step reinforces and amplifies the covariance structure of the
data, while simultaneously removing spurious correlations arising from the
decoration of molecules. Our approach is compared with other few-shot methods
for drug discovery on the FS-Mol benchmark dataset. On FS-Mol, our approach
outperforms all compared methods and therefore sets a new state-of-the art for
few-shot learning in drug discovery. An ablation study shows that the
enrichment step of our method is the key to improve the predictive quality. In
a domain shift experiment, we further demonstrate the robustness of our method.

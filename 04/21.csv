  Generation","arXiv version",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Our goal is to synthesize 3D human motions given textual inputs describing
simultaneous actions, for example 'waving hand' while 'walking' at the same
time. We refer to generating such simultaneous movements as performing 'spatial
compositions'. In contrast to temporal compositions that seek to transition
from one action to another, spatial compositing requires understanding which
body parts are involved in which action, to be able to move them
simultaneously. Motivated by the observation that the correspondence between
actions and body parts is encoded in powerful language models, we extract this
knowledge by prompting GPT-3 with text such as ""what are the body parts
involved in the action <action name>?"", while also providing the parts list and
few-shot examples. Given this action-part mapping, we combine body parts from
two motions together and establish the first automated method to spatially
compose two actions. However, training data with compositional actions is
always limited by the combinatorics. Hence, we further create synthetic data
with this approach, and use it to train a new state-of-the-art text-to-motion
generation model, called SINC (""SImultaneous actioN Compositions for 3D human
motions""). In our experiments, we find training on additional synthetic
GPT-guided compositional motions improves text-to-motion generation.

star-forming to quiescent remains a key question in galaxy evolution. We
present evidence from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey for
fading AGN activity in 6/93 post-starburst galaxies. These six galaxies show
extended emission line regions (EELRs) consistent with ionization from past AGN
activity, analogous to ""Hanny's voorwerp"" and other systems where the OIII5007
emission is bright enough to be visible in broadband imaging. Using the
infrared luminosities from IRAS to estimate the current AGN luminosity, we find
that 5/6 of the post-starburst galaxies have current AGN which have faded from
the peak luminosity required to have ionized the EELRs. Given the rate at which
we observe EELRs, the typical EELR visibility timescale, and an estimate of how
often EELRs would be visible, we estimate the duty cycle of AGN activity during
the post-starburst phase. The timescale for the galaxy to cycle between peaks
in AGN luminosity is $t_{\rm EELR}\sim1.1-2.3\times10^5$ yr. Given the rate at
which we observe current AGN activity during this phase, we estimate that the
AGN spends only 5.3% of this time (or $t_{\rm ON} = 0.6-1.3\times10^4$ yr) in
its luminous phase, with the rest of the time spent ""off"" or in a
low-luminosity phase. The length of this duty cycle may explain why so few
luminous AGN have been observed during the post-starburst phase, despite
evidence for AGN feedback at work.

performances on a variety of NLP tasks, its performance on NER is still
significantly below supervised baselines. This is due to the gap between the
two tasks the NER and LLMs: the former is a sequence labeling task in nature
while the latter is a text-generation model.
  In this paper, we propose GPT-NER to resolve this issue. GPT-NER bridges the
gap by transforming the sequence labeling task to a generation task that can be
easily adapted by LLMs e.g., the task of finding location entities in the input
text ""Columbus is a city"" is transformed to generate the text sequence
""@@Columbus## is a city"", where special tokens @@## marks the entity to
extract. To efficiently address the ""hallucination"" issue of LLMs, where LLMs
have a strong inclination to over-confidently label NULL inputs as entities, we
propose a self-verification strategy by prompting LLMs to ask itself whether
the extracted entities belong to a labeled entity tag.
  We conduct experiments on five widely adopted NER datasets, and GPT-NER
achieves comparable performances to fully supervised baselines, which is the
first time as far as we are concerned. More importantly, we find that GPT-NER
exhibits a greater ability in the low-resource and few-shot setups, when the
amount of training data is extremely scarce, GPT-NER performs significantly
better than supervised models. This demonstrates the capabilities of GPT-NER in
real-world NER applications where the number of labeled examples is limited.

Road Genome is to understand the scene structure by investigating the
relationship of perceived entities among traffic elements and lanes. Built on

Network (CNN). This is problematic in case the user wants to preserve the
privacy of the data and the service provider does not want to reveal the
weights of his CNN. Secure Inference allows the two parties to engage in a
protocol that preserves their respective privacy concerns, while revealing only
the inference result to the user. This is known as Multi-Party Computation
(MPC). A major bottleneck of MPC algorithms is communication, as the parties
must send data back and forth. The linear component of a CNN (i.e.
convolutions) can be done efficiently with minimal communication, but the
non-linear part (i.e., ReLU) requires the bulk of communication bandwidth. We
propose two ways to accelerate Secure Inference. The first is based on the
observation that the ReLU outcome of many convolutions is highly correlated.
Therefore, we replace the per pixel ReLU operation by a ReLU operation per
patch. Each layer in the network will benefit from a patch of a different size
and we devise an algorithm to choose the optimal set of patch sizes through a
novel reduction of the problem to a knapsack problem. The second way to
accelerate Secure Inference is based on cutting the number of bit comparisons
required for a secure ReLU operation. We demonstrate the cumulative effect of
these tools in the semi-honest secure 3-party setting for four problems:
Classifying ImageNet using ResNet50 backbone, classifying CIFAR100 using
ResNet18 backbone, semantic segmentation of ADE20K using MobileNetV2 backbone

Boolean network is essential to predict and control the system's dynamical
behavior, for example, detecting key therapeutic targets to control pathways in
models of biological signaling and regulation. Exact estimation is generally
not possible due to the fact that the number of configurations that must be
considered grows exponentially with the system size. However, approximate,
scalable methods exist in the literature. These methods can be divided in two
main classes: (i) graph-theoretic methods that rely on representations of
Boolean dynamics into static graphs, (ii) and mean-field approaches that
describe average trajectories of the system but neglect dynamical correlations.
Here, we compare systematically the performance of these state-of-the-art
methods on a large collection of real-world gene regulatory networks. We find
comparable performance across methods. All methods underestimate the ground
truth, with mean-field approaches having a better recall but a worse precision
than graph-theoretic methods. Computationally speaking, graph-theoretic methods
are faster than mean-field ones in sparse networks, but are slower in dense
networks. The preference of which method to use, therefore, depends on a
network's connectivity and the relative importance of recall vs. precision for
the specific application at hand.

characterized by an energy cascade from large to small scales where the cascade
is eventually arrested by dissipation. In this Letter, we show how to harness
these seemingly structureless turbulent cascades to generate patterns.
Conceptually, pattern or structure formation entails a process of wavelength
selection: patterns typically arise from the linear instability of a
homogeneous state. By contrast, the mechanism we propose here is fully
non-linear and triggered by a non-dissipative arrest of turbulent cascades.
Instead of being dissipated, energy piles up at intermediate scales. Using a
combination of theory and large-scale simulations, we show that the tunable
wavelength of these cascade-induced patterns is set by a non-dissipative
transport coefficient called odd or gyro viscosity. This non-dissipative
viscosity is ubiquitous in chiral systems ranging from plasmas, bio-active
media and quantum fluids. Beyond chiral fluids, cascade-induced pattern
formation could occur in natural systems including oceanic and atmospheric
flows, planetary and stellar plasma such as the solar wind, as well as in
industrial processes such as the pulverization of objects into debris or in
chemistry and biology where the coagulation of droplets can be interrupted at a
tunable scale.

empirically invalidate the argument that training and certifying the classifier

conferred are a direct result of progressively reducing metabolic expenditure
due to colder temperatures while simultaneously avoiding the irreversible
damage caused by the crystallization of ice. Unfortunately, the freezing of
water in bulk systems of clinical relevance is dominated by random
heterogeneous nucleation initiated by uncharacterized trace impurities, and the
marked unpredictability of this behavior has prevented implementation of
supercooling outside of controlled laboratory settings and in volumes larger
than a few milliliters. Here, we develop a statistical model that jointly
captures both the inherent stochastic nature of nucleation using conventional
Poisson statistics as well as the random variability of heterogeneous
nucleation catalysis through bivariate extreme value statistics. Individually,
these two classes of models cannot account for both the time-dependent nature
of nucleation and the sample-to-sample variability associated with
heterogeneous catalysis, and traditional extreme value models have only
considered variation of the characteristic nucleation temperature. We conduct a
series of constant cooling rate and isothermal nucleation experiments with
physiological saline solutions and leverage the statistical model to evaluate
the natural variability of kinetic and thermodynamic nucleation parameters. By
quantifying freezing probability as a function of temperature, supercooled
duration, and system volume, while accounting for nucleation site variability,
this study also provides a basis for the rational design of stable supercooled

can be used more efficiently in a setting where drivers, in addition to having
personal vehicle batteries, have access to a shared battery resource. More
precisely, we consider the problem of minimizing aggregate battery capacity in
settings with and without a shared resource subject to the requirement that
driver commuting needs are met with high reliability. To assess the potential
for reductions in deployed battery capacity with the addition of a shared

has proved itself to be crucial for sensing and energy harvesting. Topological
semimetals with gapless energy dispersion and abundant topological surface and

circular photogalvanic effect observed in Weyl semimetals. Here we find that
for a topological nodal-line semimetal (NLSM) with nodal ring bulk states and
drumhead surface states (DSS), a significant photocurrent can be produced by an
electromagnetic (EM) wave by means of the quantum Hall effect. The Hall current
is enabled by electron transfer between Landau levels (LLs) and triggered by
both the electric field and magnetic field components of an EM wave. This Hall
current is physically connected to an unusually large quantum-Hall conductivity
of the zeroth LLs resulting from quantized DSS. These LLs are found to be
highly degenerate due to the unique band-folding effect associated with
magnetic-field-induced expansion of a unit cell. Furthermore, we observe that
the Hall current induced solely by an in-plane linearly-polarized EM wave
becomes a quantized entity which allows for possible direct measurement of the
DSS density in a topological NLSM. This work paves a way toward designing
high-magnetic-field-sensitivity detection devices for industrial and space
applications, such as the development of self-detection of

is widely adopted in literature, we find that simple frame alignment already
provides enough essence without temporal attention. To this end, in this paper,
we proposed a novel Implicit Learnable Alignment (ILA) method, which minimizes
the temporal modeling effort while achieving incredibly high performance.
Specifically, for a frame pair, an interactive point is predicted in each
frame, serving as a mutual information rich region. By enhancing the features
around the interactive point, two frames are implicitly aligned. The aligned
features are then pooled into a single token, which is leveraged in the
subsequent spatial self-attention. Our method allows eliminating the costly or
insufficient temporal self-attention in video. Extensive experiments on

non-stationarity, excessive action distribution shift, and overfitting. We
perform thorough empirical analysis on state-based DeepMind control suite (DMC)

severely affects the performance of deep RL algorithms, and prior methods that

Multiple series of simulations with different luminosities and radiative

investigated. From the results of these simulations we extrapolate to find the
entrainment rate at the nominal heating rate and thermal diffusion given by the

reduces the initially unrealistically large entrainment. This reduction is
enabled by a spatial separation that develops between the entropy gradient and
the composition gradient. The convective boundary moves outward much more
slowly at the end of these simulations. Finally, we present a method to predict
the extent and character of penetrative convection beyond the Schwarzschild

structured molecular gas distribution with a clear nucleus, a nuclear ring and
offset dust lanes. We identify $170$ spatially- and spectrally-resolved giant
molecular clouds (GMCs). These clouds have comparable sizes ($R_{\mathrm{c}}$)
and larger gas masses, observed linewidths ($\sigma_{\mathrm{obs,los}}$) and
gas mass surface densities than those of clouds in the Milky Way disc. The size
-- linewidth relation of the clouds is one of the steepest reported so far
($\sigma_{\mathrm{obs,los}}\propto R_{\mathrm{c}}^{1.20}$), the clouds are on
average only marginally bound (with a mean virial parameter
$\langle\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}\rangle\approx2$), and high velocity dispersions
are observed in the nuclear ring. These behaviours are likely due to bar-driven
gas shocks and inflows along the offset dust lanes, and we infer an inflow
velocity of $\approx120$ kms$^{-1}$ and a total molecular gas mass inflow rate
of $\approx5$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ into the nuclear ring. The observed internal
velocity gradients of the clouds are consistent with internal turbulence. The
number of clouds in the nuclear ring decreases with azimuthal angle downstream
from the dust lanes without clear variation of cloud properties. This is likely
due to the estimated short lifetime of the clouds ($\approx6$ Myr), which
appears to be mainly regulated by cloud-cloud collision and/or shear processes.
Overall, it thus seems that the presence of the large-scale bar and gas inflows
to the centre of NGC 5806 affect cloud properties.

questions in a model where parties have access to shared EPR pairs, thus
demonstrating the cryptographic power of this resource.
  First, we construct a one-shot (i.e., single message) string oblivious
transfer (OT) protocol with random receiver bit in the shared EPR pairs model,
assuming the (sub-exponential) hardness of LWE. Building on this, we show that
{\em secure teleportation through quantum channels} is possible. Specifically,
given the description of any quantum operation $Q$, a sender with (quantum)
input $\rho$ can send a single classical message that securely transmits
$Q(\rho)$ to a receiver. That is, we realize an ideal quantum channel that
takes input $\rho$ from the sender and provably delivers $Q(\rho)$ to the
receiver without revealing any other information. This immediately gives a
number of applications in the shared EPR pairs model: (1) non-interactive
secure computation of unidirectional \emph{classical} randomized
functionalities, (2) NIZK for QMA from standard (sub-exponential) hardness
assumptions, and (3) a non-interactive \emph{zero-knowledge} state synthesis
protocol.

protocol for classical functionalities in the shared EPR pairs model that is
\emph{unconditionally-secure} in the (quantum-accessible) random oracle model.

considering them as instances of the same Feller-continuous Markov process with
different initial conditions. Moreover, the authors show that these so-called
pruning processes converge in the Skorokhod space of c\`adl\`ag paths with
values in the space of bi-measure $\mathbb{R}$-trees, whenever the initial
bi-measure $\mathbb{R}$-trees converge.
  In this paper we first provide an example to the above principle by verifying
that a sequence of suitably rescaled critical conditioned Galton-Watson trees
whose offspring distributions lie in the domain of attraction of a stable law
of index $\alpha \in (1,2]$ converge to the $\alpha$-stable L\'evy-tree in the

wave packets for protons are performed by solving the time-dependent

visibility, are investigated. The results show that the Talbot fringes shift
significantly in the transverse direction even for a small change in the
applied electric field ($\Delta E_0$ $=0.1$ V/m) and its orientation ($\Delta
\theta$ $=0.1^o$). The potential barriers arising from a spatially modulated
electric field are observed to cause significant distortions in the Talbot

to the efficient transfer of energy from the oscillating field to the wave

$\omega_0$ ($=2\pi/T_0$), where $T_0$ is the interaction time. This study will
be helpful in uniform electric field-controlled precision metrology, developing
a highly sensitive electric field sensor based on Talbot interference, and
precisely aligning the matter wave optical setup. Furthermore, the sidebands in
the Talbot fringe can be used as a precise tool as momentum splitter in matter

single prompts highly varies depending on the dataset and the task, from
IoU=0.1135 for spine MRI to IoU=0.8650 for hip X-ray. (2) Segmentation
performance appears to be better for well-circumscribed objects with prompts
with less ambiguity and poorer in various other scenarios such as the
segmentation of brain tumors. (3) SAM performs notably better with box prompts
than with point prompts. (4) SAM outperforms similar methods RITM, SimpleClick,

multiple-point prompts are provided iteratively, SAM's performance generally
improves only slightly while other methods' performance improves to the level
that surpasses SAM's point-based performance. We also provide several
illustrations for SAM's performance on all tested datasets, iterative
segmentation, and SAM's behavior given prompt ambiguity. We conclude that SAM
shows impressive zero-shot segmentation performance for certain medical imaging

make a significant impact in automated medical image segmentation in medical

rich features capture not only objects but also less relevant image background.
In contrast, Instance Discrimination (ID) methods focus on objects. In this
work, we study how to combine the efficiency and scalability of MIM with the
ability of ID to perform downstream classification in the absence of large
amounts of labeled data. To this end, we introduce Masked Autoencoder
Contrastive Tuning (MAE-CT), a sequential approach that applies Nearest
Neighbor Contrastive Learning (NNCLR) to a pre-trained MAE. MAE-CT tunes the
rich features such that they form semantic clusters of objects without using
any labels. Applied to large and huge Vision Transformer (ViT) models, MAE-CT
matches or excels previous self-supervised methods trained on ImageNet in
linear probing, k-NN and low-shot classification accuracy as well as in
unsupervised clustering accuracy. Notably, similar results can be achieved
without additional image augmentations. While ID methods generally rely on
hand-crafted augmentations to avoid shortcut learning, we find that nearest
neighbor lookup is sufficient and that this data-driven augmentation effect
improves with model size. MAE-CT is compute efficient. For instance, starting
from a MAE pre-trained ViT-L/16, MAE-CT increases the ImageNet 1% low-shot
accuracy from 67.7% to 72.6%, linear probing accuracy from 76.0% to 80.2% and

  Generative Models",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces GenCorres, a novel unsupervised joint shape matching
(JSM) approach. The basic idea of GenCorres is to learn a parametric mesh
generator to fit an unorganized deformable shape collection while constraining
deformations between adjacent synthetic shapes to preserve geometric structures
such as local rigidity and local conformality. GenCorres presents three
appealing advantages over existing JSM techniques. First, GenCorres performs
JSM among a synthetic shape collection whose size is much bigger than the input
shapes and fully leverages the data-driven power of JSM. Second, GenCorres
unifies consistent shape matching and pairwise matching (i.e., by enforcing
deformation priors between adjacent synthetic shapes). Third, the generator
provides a concise encoding of consistent shape correspondences. However,
learning a mesh generator from an unorganized shape collection is challenging.
It requires a good initial fitting to each shape and can easily get trapped by
local minimums. GenCorres addresses this issue by learning an implicit
generator from the input shapes, which provides intermediate shapes between two
arbitrary shapes. We introduce a novel approach for computing correspondences
between adjacent implicit surfaces and force the correspondences to preserve
geometric structures and be cycle-consistent. Synthetic shapes of the implicit
generator then guide initial fittings (i.e., via template-based deformation)
for learning the mesh generator. Experimental results show that GenCorres
considerably outperforms state-of-the-art JSM techniques on benchmark datasets.
The synthetic shapes of GenCorres preserve local geometric features and yield
competitive performance gains against state-of-the-art deformable shape
generators.

observe. A growing portion of that information is not only provided, but
carefully curated by social media platforms. Although lawmakers largely agree
that platforms should not operate without any oversight, there is little
consensus on how to regulate social media. There is consensus, however, that
creating a strict, global standard of ""acceptable"" content is untenable (e.g.,
in the US, it is incompatible with Section 230 of the Communications Decency
Act and the First Amendment).
  In this work, we propose that algorithmic filtering should be regulated with
respect to a flexible, user-driven baseline. We provide a concrete framework
for regulating and auditing a social media platform according to such a
baseline. In particular, we introduce the notion of a baseline feed: the
content that a user would see without filtering (e.g., on Twitter, this could
be the chronological timeline). We require that the feeds a platform filters
contain ""similar"" informational content as their respective baseline feeds, and
we design a principled way to measure similarity. This approach is motivated by
related suggestions that regulations should increase user agency. We present an
auditing procedure that checks whether a platform honors this requirement.
Notably, the audit needs only black-box access to a platform's filtering
algorithm, and it does not access or infer private user information. We provide
theoretical guarantees on the strength of the audit. We further show that
requiring closeness between filtered and baseline feeds does not impose a large
performance cost, nor does it create echo chambers.

great success in various applications, such as image and video analysis,
natural language processing, recommendation systems, and drug discovery.
However, inherent uncertainties derived from different root causes have been
realized as serious hurdles for DNNs to find robust and trustworthy solutions
for real-world problems. A lack of consideration of such uncertainties may lead
to unnecessary risk. For example, a self-driving autonomous car can misdetect a
human on the road. A deep learning-based medical assistant may misdiagnose
cancer as a benign tumor.
  In this work, we study how to measure different uncertainty causes for DNNs
and use them to solve diverse decision-making problems more effectively. In the
first part of this thesis, we develop a general learning framework to quantify
multiple types of uncertainties caused by different root causes, such as
vacuity (i.e., uncertainty due to a lack of evidence) and dissonance (i.e.,
uncertainty due to conflicting evidence), for graph neural networks. We provide
a theoretical analysis of the relationships between different uncertainty
types. We further demonstrate that dissonance is most effective for
misclassification detection and vacuity is most effective for
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. In the second part of the thesis, we study
the significant impact of OOD objects on semi-supervised learning (SSL) for
DNNs and develop a novel framework to improve the robustness of existing SSL
algorithms against OODs. In the last part of the thesis, we create a general
learning framework to quantity multiple uncertainty types for multi-label
temporal neural networks. We further develop novel uncertainty fusion operators

this but do not generalize well when the input pose is far from those seen
during training. For rigid point clouds, remarkable generalization has been
achieved by leveraging SE(3)-equivariant networks, but these methods do not
work on articulated objects. In this work we extend this idea to human bodies
and propose ArtEq, a novel part-based SE(3)-equivariant neural architecture for
SMPL model estimation from point clouds. Specifically, we learn a part
detection network by leveraging local SO(3) invariance, and regress shape and
pose using articulated SE(3) shape-invariant and pose-equivariant networks, all
trained end-to-end. Our novel equivariant pose regression module leverages the
permutation-equivariant property of self-attention layers to preserve
rotational equivariance. Experimental results show that ArtEq can generalize to
poses not seen during training, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
74.5%, without requiring an optimization refinement step. Further, compared
with competing works, our method is more than three orders of magnitude faster

further unleash the users' creativity, it is desirable for the model to be
controllable by multiple modalities simultaneously, e.g., generating and
editing faces by describing the age (text-driven) while drawing the face shape
(mask-driven). In this work, we present Collaborative Diffusion, where
pre-trained uni-modal diffusion models collaborate to achieve multi-modal face
generation and editing without re-training. Our key insight is that diffusion
models driven by different modalities are inherently complementary regarding
the latent denoising steps, where bilateral connections can be established
upon. Specifically, we propose dynamic diffuser, a meta-network that adaptively
hallucinates multi-modal denoising steps by predicting the spatial-temporal
influence functions for each pre-trained uni-modal model. Collaborative
Diffusion not only collaborates generation capabilities from uni-modal
diffusion models, but also integrates multiple uni-modal manipulations to
perform multi-modal editing. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate the superiority of our framework in both image quality and

from localizing most FRBs to their host galaxies. Very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) can readily provide the subarcsecond resolution needed to
localize many FRBs to their hosts. Thus we developed TONE: an interferometric
array of eight $6~\mathrm{m}$ dishes to serve as a pathfinder for the CHIME/FRB
Outriggers project, which will use wide field of view cylinders to determine
the sky positions for a large sample of FRBs, revealing their positions within
their host galaxies to subarcsecond precision. In the meantime, TONE's
$\sim3333~\mathrm{km}$ baseline with CHIME proves to be an excellent testbed
for the development and characterization of single-pulse VLBI techniques at the

astrometric errors are dominated by uncertainties in the clock measurements
which build up between successive Crab pulsar calibrations which happen every

the resulting image, providing feedback to the reconstructor. Different from
work based on distillation which produces a single 3D asset for each textual

can output a controllable 3D asset from a given image, real or generated, in
only seconds. Our network can be used for analysis, including monocular

frame of observers, the equivalence principle dictates that in the gradient
approximation for the long-wavelength mode there is only a single, manifestly
time-independent consistency relation for the $N$-point function. This simple
form is dictated by the initial mapping between synchronous and local
coordinates, unlike Newtonian gauge and its correspondingly separate dilation
and Newtonian consistency relations. Dynamical effects only appear at quadratic
order in the squeezed limit and are again characterized by a change in the
local background, also known as the separate universe approach. We show that
for the 3-point function the compatibility between these squeezed-limit
relations and second-order perturbation theory requires both the initial and

clarifies the role of evolution or late-time projection effects in establishing
the consistency relation for observable bispectra, which is especially

below the matter-radiation equality scale in the MD era. Defining an

VLQs leads to flavour-changing neutral currents at tree level and deviations
from unitarity of the CKM matrix, introducing rich phenomenological
implications. These new effects are naturally suppressed by the masses of the
new quarks, that are constrained to be above the electroweak scale. In
addition, striking new effects can be achieved with the inclusion of an extra

with Compton scattering on free electrons, photo-absorption and fluorescence by
cold atomic gas, scattering on bound electrons, and extinction by dust. This
includes a novel treatment of extreme-forward scattering by dust, and a
detailed description of anomalous Rayleigh scattering. To verify our X-ray
implementation, we performed the first dedicated benchmark of X-ray torus

the 3D nature of the code by producing synthetic X-ray images and spectra of
clumpy torus models. SKIRT forms a powerful new tool to model AGN circumnuclear

the need for a robust framework that can handle non-linear 3D radiative

an asymptotically exact renormalization group (RG) approach. In two dimensions,
the same RG rules have been implemented numerically, and demonstrate a flow to
infinite randomness. However, analytical understanding of the structure of this
RG has remained elusive due to the development of geometrical structure in the
graph of interacting spins. To understand the character of the fixed point, we
consider the RG flow acting on a joint ensemble of graphs and couplings. We
propose that the RG effectively occurs in two stages: (1) randomization of the
interaction graph until it belongs to a certain ensemble of random
triangulations of the plane, and (2) a flow of the distributions of couplings
to infinite randomness while the graph ensemble remains invariant. This picture
is substantiated by a numerical RG in which one obtains a steady-state graph
degree distribution and subsequently infinite-randomness scaling distributions
of the couplings. Both of these aspects of the RG flow can be approximately
reproduced in simplified analytical models.

the accuracy and potential performance benefits of two advanced Maxwell solver
algorithms: a non-standard finite difference scheme (CKC) and an
ultrahigh-order pseudo-spectral method (PSATD). We find that for the
relativistic reconnection problem, CKC and PSATD qualitatively and
quantitatively match the standard Yee-grid finite-difference method. CKC and
PSATD both admit a time step that is 40% longer than Yee, resulting in a ~40%
faster time to solution for CKC, but no performance benefit for PSATD when
using a current deposition scheme that satisfies Gauss's law. Relaxing this
constraint maintains accuracy and yields a 30% speedup. Unlike Yee and CKC,
PSATD is numerically stable at any time step, allowing for a larger time step
than with the finite-difference methods. We found that increasing the time step
2.4-3 times over the standard Yee step still yields accurate results, but only
translates to modest performance improvements over CKC due to the current
deposition scheme used with PSATD. Further optimization of this scheme will
likely improve the effective performance of PSATD.

Close to the SMBH, where the velocity dispersion is larger than the escape

stellar population within $0.01$ pc is halved within about a Gyr because of
destructive collisions. Additionally, we predict a diffuse population of

this actor can exhibit complex and multimodal characteristics, suggesting
issues with the conditional Gaussian actor fit with advantage weighted

two systems derived from the layered superconductor 2H-TaS$_2$ were reported.
These systems share the common feature that additional layers have been
inserted between the 1H-TaS$_2$ layers. In both cases, the $\pi$ phase shift
has been interpreted as evidence for the emergence of exotic superconductivity
in the 1H layers. Here, we propose an alternative explanation assuming that
superconductivity in the individual 1H layers is of conventional $s$-wave
nature derived from the parent 2H-TaS$_2$. We show that a negative Josephson
coupling between neighboring 1H layers can explain the observations.
Furthermore, we find that the negative coupling arises naturally due to the
well understood spin-momentum locking of Ising type in a single 1H layer
together with the inversion symmetry of the double layer. By paying attention
to the overall inversion symmetry in the material, we can also explain the
absence of a $\pi$ phase shift in the control sample when achiral molecules are
intercalated. In the exotic superconductivity scenario, it is challenging to
explain why the critical temperature is almost the same as in the parent
material and, in the 4Hb case, the superconductivity's robustness to disorder.
Both are non-issues in our picture, which further pinpoints the common origin
of the effect and exposes the common features that are special in these two
systems.

correlated electronic phases that spontaneously break its underlying
symmetries. The microscopic nature of these phases and their residual
symmetries stands as a key outstanding puzzle whose resolution promises to shed
light on the origin of superconductivity in twisted materials. Here we
investigate correlated phases of MATTG using scanning tunneling microscopy and
identify striking signatures of interaction-driven spatial symmetry breaking.
In low-strain samples, over a filling range of about 2-3 electrons or holes per
moir\'e unit cell, we observe atomic-scale reconstruction of the graphene
lattice that accompanies a correlated gap in the tunneling spectrum. This
short-scale restructuring appears as a Kekul\'e supercell -- implying
spontaneous inter-valley coherence between electrons -- and persists in a wide
range of magnetic fields and temperatures that coincide with the development of
the gap. Large-scale maps covering several moir\'e unit cells further reveal a
slow evolution of the Kekul\'e pattern, indicating that atomic-scale
reconstruction coexists with translation symmetry breaking at the much longer
moir\'e scale. We employ auto-correlation and Fourier analyses to extract the
intrinsic periodicity of these phases and find that they are consistent with
the theoretically proposed incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral order. Moreover, we
find that the wavelength characterizing moir\'e-scale modulations monotonically
decreases with hole doping away from half-filling of the bands and depends only
weakly on the magnetic field. Our results provide essential insights into the
nature of MATTG correlated phases in the presence of strain and imply that
superconductivity emerges from an inter-valley coherent parent state.

that large speed transitions, together with higher maximum speed attained,

as the fundamental class of non-scattering sources with several potential
applications ranging from nonlinear optics to thermodynamics thanks to their
field confinement and minimal scattering fingerprints. Nevertheless, other
non-radiating sources are also possible and can provide significant energy
confinement at the nanoscale if they spectrally overlap with their electrical
counterparts. On the other hand, super-scattering states represent the opposite
regime of light-matter interaction wherein the scattering cross-section of a
particular multipolar moment exceeds the single-channel limit, leading to a
strong scattering in the direction of the pump beam. Here, we demonstrate that
the interplay between the topology of incident light and the subwavelength
scatterer can lead to these two opposite regimes of light-matter interactions
within an isolated all-dielectric meta-atom. In particular, we show that the
presented scatterer can support new non-scattering states, called hybrid
anapole, leading to significant suppression of the far-field radiation and
enhancement of electromagnetic energy inside the meta-atom. We also explore the
role of particle orientation and its inversion symmetry on the scattering
response and show how switching between non-scattering to super-scattering
states can occur within the same platform. The presented study elucidates the
role of light and matter topologies in the scattering response of subwavelength
meta-atoms and reveals the formation of two extreme opposite regimes of
light-matter interaction, opening new avenues in several applications ranging

to take a spectrum of all the events, likely only getting host redshifts long
after the SNe Ia have faded, we need to turn to methods that could separate
these populations based purely on photometry or host properties. Here, we
present a study of a sample of well observed, nearby SNe Ia and their hosts to
determine if there are significant enough difference between these populations
that can be discerned only from the stellar population properties of their
hosts. Our results indicate that the global host properties, including star
formation, stellar mass, stellar population age, and dust attenuation, of
sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions do not differ significantly from those of
normal mass origin. However, we do find evidence using Na I D equivalent widths
that the local environments of sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions are more
dust-affected than normal SNe Ia. Future work requires strengthening
photometric probes of sub-Chandrasekhar SNe and their local environments to
distinguish these events.

reducing customer engagement over a specific period. Two main business
marketing strategies play vital roles to increase market share dollar-value:
gaining new and preserving existing customers. Customer acquisition cost can be
five to six times that for customer retention, hence investing in customers
with churn risk is smart. Causal analysis of the churn model can predict
whether a customer will churn in the foreseeable future and assist enterprises
to identify effects and possible causes for churn and subsequently use that
knowledge to apply tailored incentives. This paper proposes a framework using a
deep feedforward neural network for classification accompanied by a sequential
pattern mining method on high-dimensional sparse data. We also propose a causal
Bayesian network to predict cause probabilities that lead to customer churn.
Evaluation metrics on test data confirm the XGBoost and our deep learning model
outperformed previous techniques. Experimental analysis confirms that some
independent causal variables representing the level of super guarantee
contribution, account growth, and customer tenure were identified as
confounding factors for customer churn with a high degree of belief. This paper

transition between the activated (or open) and deactivated (or closed) states
of an ion-channel, which makes transport through that channel highly selective.
In general, gating is a mechanism that imposes an additional restriction on a
transport, as the process ends only when the `gate' is open and continues
otherwise. When diffusion occurs in presence of a constant bias to a {\it
gated} target, i.e., to a target that switches between an open and a closed
state, the dynamics essentially slows down compared to {\it ungated}
drift-diffusion, resulting in an increase in the mean completion time. In this
work, we utilize stochastic resetting as an external protocol to counterbalance
the delay due to gating. We consider a particle that undergoes drift-diffusion
in the presence of a stochastically gated target and is moreover subjected to a
rate-limiting resetting dynamics. Calculating the minimal mean completion time
rendered by an optimal resetting for this exactly-solvable system, we construct
a phase diagram that owns three distinct phases: (i) where resetting can make
gated drift-diffusion faster even compared to the original ungated process,
(ii) where resetting still expedites gated drift-diffusion, but not beyond the
original ungated process, and (iii) where resetting fails to expedite gated
drift-diffusion. Gated drift-diffusion aptly models various stochastic
processes such as chemical reactions that exclusively take place for certain
activated state of the reactants. Our work predicts the conditions where
stochastic resetting can act as a useful strategy to enhance the rate of such
processes without compromising on their selectivity.

symmetries and conservation laws of gl-regular Nijenhuis operators. We prove
the splitting Theorem for symmetries and conservation laws of Nijenhuis
operators, show that the space of symmetries of a gl-regular Nijenhuis operator
forms a commutative algebra with respect to (pointwise) matrix multiplication.
Moreover, all the elements of this algebra are strong symmetries of each other.
We establish a natural relationship between symmetries and conservation laws of
a gl-regular Nijenhuis operator and systems of the first and second companion
coordinates. Moreover, we show that the space of conservation laws is naturally
related to the space of symmetries in the sense that any conservation laws can
be obtained from a single conservation law by multiplication with an
appropriate symmetry. In particular, we provide an explicit description of all
symmetries and conservation laws for gl-regular operators at algebraically
generic points. The second line of results contains an application of the
theoretical part to a certain system of partial differential equations of
hydrodynamic type, which was previously studied by different authors, but
mainly in the diagonalisable case. We show that this system is integrable in
quadratures, i.e., its solutions can be found for almost all initial curves by
integrating closed 1-forms and solving some systems of functional equations.
The system is not diagonalisable in general, and construction and integration
of such systems is an actively studied and explicitly stated problem in the
literature.

lattice that exhibits quantized Hall conductance in the absence of an external

by varying one of its three nearest neighbour hopping amplitudes ($t_1$), while
keeping the other two ($t$) fixed. This breaks the $C_3$ symmetry of the
Hamiltonian, while the $M_x*T$ symmetry is preserved. The symmetry breaking
causes the Dirac cones to shift from the K and the K' points in the Brillouin
zone (BZ) to an intermediate M point. This is evident from the Berry curvature
plots which show a similar shift in the corresponding values as a function of
$\frac{t_1}{t}$. We observe two different topological phases, one being a
topological insulator (TI) phase and the other is a higher order topological
insulator (HOTI). The Chern number ($C$) remains perfectly quantized at a value
of $C=1$ for the TI phase and goes to zero in the HOTI phase. Furthermore the
evolution of the Wannier charge center (WCC) as the band is deformed shows a
jump in the TI phase indicating a non-trivial bulk. We also study the HOTI

the presence of in-gap zero energy corner modes. The polarization of the

distributed nature of FL and the unvetted participants' data makes it
vulnerable to backdoor attacks. In these attacks, adversaries inject malicious
functionality into the centralized model during training, leading to
intentional misclassifications for specific adversary-chosen inputs. While
previous research has demonstrated successful injections of persistent
backdoors in FL, the persistence also poses a challenge, as their existence in
the centralized model can prompt the central aggregation server to take
preventive measures to penalize the adversaries. Therefore, this paper proposes
a methodology that enables adversaries to effectively remove backdoors from the
centralized model upon achieving their objectives or upon suspicion of possible
detection. The proposed approach extends the concept of machine unlearning and
presents strategies to preserve the performance of the centralized model and
simultaneously prevent over-unlearning of information unrelated to backdoor
patterns, making the adversaries stealthy while removing backdoors. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores machine unlearning in FL
to remove backdoors to the benefit of adversaries. Exhaustive evaluation
considering image classification scenarios demonstrates the efficacy of the
proposed method in efficient backdoor removal from the centralized model,

a combination of interpolation and the standard estimator. We apply the S-ACF
to astrophysical data by extracting rotation periods for the spotted star KIC

its applications ranging from radiative cooling to thermal management. In this
paper, we design a multi-band graphene-based metamaterial absorber compatible
with infrared applications and radiative cooling performance. The proposed
structure consists of the single-sized metal-insulator-metal (MIM) grating
deposited on metal/insulator substrate and single-layer graphene. The system
realizes a broadband perfect absorption ranging from 940 nm to 1498 nm and a
narrowband perfect absorption at the resonance wavelength of 5800 nm.
Meanwhile, the absorptivity of the structure is suppressed within the mid-wave
infrared (MWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) ranges. Furthermore, to
demonstrate the tunability of the structure, an external voltage gate is
applied to the single-layer graphene. It is shown that, by varying the chemical
potential of graphene layer from 0 eV to 1 eV , the absorption resonances at
the mid-infrared (MIR) range can shift toward the shorter wavelengths. It is
also observed that the structure can possess an average net cooling power over
18 at the ambient temperature, when is varied from 0 eV to 1 eV. Finally, we
investigate the overall performances of the structure as a function of

theory ``really'' contains only unitary physical dynamics--i.e., that the only
physically quantifiable evolution is that given by the time-dependent
Schrodinger equation. This leads to two distinct classes of interpretations for
the standard theory in its orthodox form: (i) an Everettian-type approach
assuming that all mutually exclusive outcomes occur in different ``branches''
of the universe; or (ii) single-outcome approaches that assume a ``projection
postulate'' (PP) with no accompanying physical account within quantum theory. A
contrasting, unorthodox approach is to suggest forms of quantum theory that
involve physical non-unitarity; these are called ``objective collapse models.''
Among these are Penrose's theory of gravitation-induced collapse and the
Transactional Interpretation. The primary focus of this paper is an example
demonstrating that standard quantum theory (with or without the projection
postulate) can in-principle yield empirically consequential inconsistencies.
Thus, it appears that for quantum theory to be viable in a realist sense (as
opposed to being an instrumentalist protocol in which inconsistencies are
evaded by changing the protocol), it must possess genuine, physical
non-unitarity yielding well-defined single outcomes. This leads to the
conclusion that objective collapse models should be more seriously considered.

learn an approximation to a processor's capability function. We explore how to
define the capability function, and we explain how data for training neural

convolutional neural networks can accurately model a processor's capability

weakened so that the blocking of changes is limited to only those with
multilateral backings. This principle of consensual blocking, as well as the
traditional core-defining principle of unilateral blocking and one straddling
in between, can all be applied to partition-allocation pairs. Each such pair is
made up of a partition of the grand coalition and a corresponding allocation
vector whose components are individually rational and efficient for the various
constituent coalitions of the given partition. For the resulting strong,
medium, and weak stability concepts, the first is core-compatible in that the
traditional core exactly contains those allocations that are associated through
this strong stability concept with the all-consolidated partition consisting of
only the grand coalition. Probably more importantly, the latter medium and weak
stability concepts are universal. By this, we mean that any game, no matter how
``poor'' it is, has its fair share of stable solutions. There is also a
steepest ascent method to guide the convergence process to a mediumly stable

$n$-dimensional locally area minimising rectifiable current $T$ of codimension
$\geq 2$ near its typical (i.e.\ ${\mathcal H}^{n-2}$ a.e.) singular points.
Our approach relies on an intrinsic frequency function for $T$, which we call
the \emph{planar frequency function}, which is defined geometrically relative
to a given $n$-dimensional plane $P$ and a given base point in the support of
$T$. In the present article we establish that the planar frequency function
satisfies an approximate monotonicity property, and takes values $\leq 1$ on
any cone ($\neq P$) meeting $P^{\perp}$ only at the origin, whenever the base
point is the vertex of the cone. Using these properties we obtain a
\emph{decomposition theorem} for the singular set of $T$, which (roughly
speaking) asserts the following: for any integer $q \geq 2$, the set ${\rm
sing}_{q} \, T$ of density $q$ singularities of $T$ can be written as ${\rm
sing}_{q} \, T = {\mathcal S} \cup {\mathcal B}$ for disjoint sets ${\mathcal
S}$ and ${\mathcal B}$, where: (I) each point $Z \in {\mathcal S}$ has a
neighbourhood ${\mathbf B}_{\rho_{Z}}(Z)$ such that about any point $Z^{\prime}
\in {\mathbf B}_{\rho_{Z}}(Z) \cap {\rm spt} \, T$ with density $\geq q$ and at
any scale $\rho^{\prime} < \rho_{Z}$, $T$ is significantly closer to some
non-planar cone ${\mathbf C}_{Z^{\prime}, \rho^{\prime}}$ than to any plane,
and (II) ${\mathcal B}$ is relatively closed in ${\rm sing}_{q} \, T$ and $T$
satisfies a locally uniform estimate along ${\mathcal B}$ implying decay of $T$
to a unique tangent plane faster than a fixed exponential rate in the scale.
This result is central to the more refined analysis of $T$ we perform in
\cite{KrumWicb} and \cite{KrumWicc}.

time between data gathering and publication of scientific results. Because of
that, the US NGO heavily invests in producing data reduction tutorials and

the support provided to the user community is sufficient and effective, through
website analytics and social media engagement numbers. These quantitative
metrics serve as the baseline for internal reporting and directing efforts to
new or current products. In the era of the NSF's National Optical-Infrared
Astronomy Research Laboratory (NOIRLab), the US NGO is well-positioned to be
the liaison between the US user base and the Gemini Observatory. Furthermore,
collaborations within NOIRLab programs, such as the Astro Data Lab and the Time

new products. The future landscape laid out by the Astro 2020 report confirms
the need to establish such synergies and provide more integrated user support

flexible strategy is the switched-array-based channel sounding, where antenna
elements are activated at different time instants to measure the channel
spatial characteristics. Although its hardware complexity is decreased due to
fewer radio-frequency (RF) chains, sequentially switching the antenna elements
can result in aliasing in the joint estimation of angles and Doppler
frequencies of multipath components (MPCs). Therefore, pseudo-random switching
has been proposed to mitigate such aliasing and increase estimation accuracy in
both angular and Doppler domains. Nevertheless, the increased Doppler
resolution could cause additional post-processing complexity of parameter
estimation, which is relevant when the Doppler frequencies are not of interest,
e.g., for spatial channel modeling. This paper proposes an improved hybrid
sequential and random switching scheme. The primary purpose is to maintain the
estimation accuracy of angles of MPCs while decreasing the resolution of
Doppler frequencies for minimized complexity of channel parameter estimation. A
simulated-annealing algorithm is exploited to obtain an optimized switching

pixels, which degrade FP detection. On the other hand, high dynamic range (HDR)
images usually present no saturated pixels but FP detection algorithms do not
take advantage of all the information present in such images. FP detection
frequently relies on differential methods, which work well in LDR images.
However, in HDR images, the differential operation response in bright areas
overshadows the response in dark areas. As an alternative to standard FP
detection methods, this study proposes an FP detector based on a coefficient of
variation (CV) designed for HDR images. The CV operation adapts its response
based on the standard deviation of pixels inside a window, working well in both
dark and bright areas of HDR images. The proposed and standard detectors are
evaluated by measuring their repeatability rate (RR) and uniformity. Our
proposed detector shows better performance when compared to other standard
state-of-the-art detectors. In uniformity metric, our proposed detector
surpasses all the other algorithms. In other hand, when using the repeatability
rate metric, the proposed detector is worse than Harris for HDR and SURF
detectors.

system with a spatially bounded supersonic flow may evolve into a
self-oscillating state that periodically emits solitons, in a process
originating from the well-known Landau instability. Here, we report observation
of self-oscillating supersonic flows in a two-dimensional atomic superfluid. By
imposing a local particle sink with strong loss, we induce a convergent radial
flow forming an acoustic analogue of a black-hole horizon and an inner horizon
around the sink. The observed superflow appears to be modulated by
quasi-periodic bursts of superluminal signals. We measure their frequencies and
find surprising agreement with numerical simulations of soliton oscillation
frequencies within the black-hole horizon. The presented experiment
demonstrates a new method for creating supersonic flows in atomic superfluids,
which may find applications in quantum simulations of curved spacetime,
supersonic turbulence, and self-oscillating dynamics in dissipative many-body
systems.

training setting for single-cell segmentation models, where the only available
training label is the rough locations of individual cells. The specific problem
is of practical interest due to the widely available nuclei counter-stain data
in biomedical literature, from which the cell locations can be derived

called collaborative knowledge sharing, which is related to but distinct from
the more well-known consistency learning methods. This strategy achieves
self-learning by sharing knowledge between a principal model and a very
light-weight collaborator model. Importantly, the two models are entirely
different in their architectures, capacities, and model outputs: In our case,
the principal model approaches the segmentation problem from an
object-detection perspective, whereas the collaborator model a sematic
segmentation perspective. We assessed the effectiveness of this strategy by
conducting experiments on LIVECell, a large single-cell segmentation dataset of

with three hidden layers is trained to extract reproductive features from the
concatenated ouput of CNNs. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
framework, three different classifiers, which are single-layer perceptron
(SLP), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM) are used.
Furthermore, the deep CNN architectures are used to create benchmark models and
trained on the same dataset for comparision. The proposed framework outperforms
other frameworks wih pre-trained feature extractors in binary classification

fibers in Groningen, the Netherlands. First, we recover the laterally varying
surface wave phase velocities (i.e., local dispersion curves) from the
fundamental-mode surface waves. We utilize the Multi Offset Phase Analysis
(MOPA) for the recovery of the laterally varying phase velocities. In this way,
we take into account the lateral variability of the subsurface structures.
  Then, instead of inverting each local dispersion curve independently, we
propose to use a novel 2D transdimensional surface wave tomography algorithm to
image the subsurface. In this approach, we parameterize the model space using
2D Voronoi cells and invert all the local dispersion curves simultaneously to
consider the lateral spatial correlation of the inversion result. Additionally,
this approach reduces the solution nonuniqueness of the inversion problem.
  The proposed methodology successfully recovered the shear-wave velocity of
the synthetic data. Application to the field data also confirms the reliability
of the proposed algorithm. The recovered 2D shear-wave velocity profile is
compared to shear-wave velocity logs obtained at the location of two boreholes,

temperature conditions. Compared to the regular use of instantaneous
temperature, the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is decreased by 30.73%
by using the proposed input feature selection and leading temperature
relationships. Our model is generalised and applied to eight real distribution
networks in Victoria, Australia, during the wildfire seasons of 2015-2020. We
demonstrate that the GRU-based model consistently outperforms another DL model,
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), at every step, giving average improvements in
Mean Squared Error (MSE) and MAPE of 10.06% and 12.86%, respectively. The
sensitivity to large-scale climate variability in training data sets, e.g. El
Ni\~no or La Ni\~na years, is considered to understand the possible
consequences for load forecasting performance stability, showing minimal
impact. Other factors such as regional poverty rate and large-scale off-peak
electricity use are potential factors to further improve forecast performance.
The proposed method achieves an average forecast MAPE of around 3%, giving a
potential annual energy saving of AU\$80.46 million for the state of Victoria.

They are also deflected in intergalactic magnetic fields (IGMFs), particularly
those associated with Mpc-scale structures. These deflections extend the
propagation times of CR particles, forming a magnetic horizon for each CR
species. The cumulative cooling and interactions of a CR ensemble also modifies
their spectral shape and composition observed on Earth. We construct a
transport formulation to calculate the observed UHE CR spectral composition for
4 classes of source population. The effects on CR propagation brought about by
IGMFs are modeled as scattering processes during transport, by centers
associated with cosmic filaments. Our calculations demonstrate that IGMFs can
have a marked effect on observed UHE CRs, and that source population models are
degenerate with IGMF properties. Interpretation of observations, including the
endorsement or rejection of any particular source classes, thus needs careful
consideration of the structural properties and evolution of IGMFs. Future
observations providing tighter constraints on IGMF properties will
significantly improve confidence in assessing UHE CR sources and their

all symmetric matrices. They showed the flow is integrable, in the classical
sense of having $d$ integrals in involution on its $2d$-dimensional phase

Symes (1980, 1982) solved it explicitly via $QR$-factorization and conjugation.
Secondly, Deift, Li, Nanda, and Tomei (1986) 'tridiagonalized' the system into
a family of tridiagonal Toda lattices which are solvable and integrable. In
this paper we derive their tridiagonalization procedure in a natural way using
the fact that the symmetric Toda flow is diffeomorphic to a twisted gradient
flow on a flag variety, which may then be decomposed into flows on a product of
Grassmannians. These flows may in turn be embedded into projective spaces via
Pl\""ucker embeddings, and mapped back to tridiagonal Toda lattice flows using
Moser's construction. In addition, we study the tridiagonalized flows projected
onto a product of permutohedra, using the twisted moment map of Bloch,
Flaschka, and Ratiu (1990). These ideas are facilitated in a natural way by the

copula families. We study the properties of the model; compare it to the linear
mixed model and end with special cases. When the three copula families and the
marginal distributions are normal, the model is equivalent to a normal linear
mixed model with random, cluster specific, intercepts. The method to select the
three copula families and to estimate their parameters are proposed. We perform

synthesis task due to unobserved elements within the scene (i.e., occlusion)
and outside the field-of-view makes the use of generative models appealing to
capture the variety of possible outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel
generative model which is capable of producing a sequence of photorealistic
images consistent with a specified camera trajectory, and a single starting
image. Our approach is centred on an autoregressive conditional diffusion-based
model capable of interpolating visible scene elements, and extrapolating
unobserved regions in a view, in a geometrically consistent manner.
Conditioning is limited to an image capturing a single camera view and the
(relative) pose of the new camera view. To measure the consistency over a
sequence of generated views, we introduce a new metric, the thresholded
symmetric epipolar distance (TSED), to measure the number of consistent frame
pairs in a sequence. While previous methods have been shown to produce high
quality images and consistent semantics across pairs of views, we show
empirically with our metric that they are often inconsistent with the desired

inference based on the information contained within the step, preceding steps,

ReCEval using natural language inference models and information-theoretic
measures. On multiple datasets, ReCEval is highly effective in identifying
different types of errors, resulting in notable improvements compared to prior
methods. We demonstrate that our informativeness metric captures the expected
flow of information in high-quality reasoning chains and we also analyze the

first recognizes the correlations among instances by establishing the graph and
then migrates the implicit information mined from the feature space to the

a vital component in the pursuit of causality knowledge. Causality is
frequently intertwined with temporal elements, as the progression from cause to
effect is not instantaneous but rather ensconced in a temporal dimension. Thus,
the extraction of temporal causality holds paramount significance in the field.
In light of this, we propose a method for extracting causality from the text
that integrates both temporal and causal relations, with a particular focus on
the time aspect. To this end, we first compile a dataset that encompasses
temporal relationships. Subsequently, we present a novel model, TC-GAT, which
employs a graph attention mechanism to assign weights to the temporal
relationships and leverages a causal knowledge graph to determine the adjacency
matrix. Additionally, we implement an equilibrium mechanism to regulate the
interplay between temporal and causal relations. Our experiments demonstrate
that our proposed method significantly surpasses baseline models in the task of
causality extraction.

Other researchers have used hot and cold blocks to deceive infrared imaging

regarded as posteriori information. So this method can deal with both
data-driven and data-free problems. As a result, it can solve the special form
of compressible N-S equations -- -Shallow-Water equations, and incompressible
N-S equations. As boundary conditions are known, this method only needs the
flow field information at a certain time to restore the past and future flow

smart contract vulnerability detection based on formal methods: DLVA checks
contracts for 29 vulnerabilities in 0.2 seconds, a speedup of 10-500x+ compared
to traditional tools.
  DLVA has three key components. Smart Contract to Vector (SC2V) uses neural
networks to map arbitrary smart contract bytecode to an high-dimensional
floating-point vector. Sibling Detector (SD) classifies contracts when a target
contract's vector is Euclidian-close to a labeled contract's vector in a
training set; although only able to judge 55.7% of the contracts in our test
set, it has an average accuracy of 97.4% with a false positive rate of only
0.1%. Lastly, Core Classifier (CC) uses neural networks to infer vulnerable
contracts regardless of vector distance. DLVA has an overall accuracy of 96.6%
with an associated false positive rate of only 3.7%.

attention in recent years due to its potential for revolutionizing traditional
manufacturing processes. One key challenge in 3D printing is managing energy
consumption, as it directly impacts the cost, efficiency, and sustainability of
the process. In this paper, we propose an energy management system that
leverages the refinement of manifold model morphing in a flexible grasping
space, to reduce costs for biological 3D printing. The manifold model is a
mathematical representation of the 3D object to be printed, and the refinement
process involves optimizing the morphing parameters of the manifold model to
achieve desired printing outcomes. To enable flexibility in the grasping space,
we incorporate data-driven approaches, such as machine learning and data
augmentation techniques, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of the energy
management system. Our proposed system addresses the challenges of limited
sample data and complex morphologies of manifold models in layered additive
manufacturing. Our method is more applicable for soft robotics and
biomechanisms. We evaluate the performance of our system through extensive
experiments and demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting and managing energy
consumption in 3D printing processes. The results highlight the importance of
refining manifold model morphing in the flexible grasping space for achieving
energy-efficient 3D printing, contributing to the advancement of green and

communication between clients and servers may not be possible, such as remote
areas without proper communication infrastructure. To overcome this challenge,
a new framework called FedEx (Federated Learning via Model Express Delivery) is
proposed. This framework employs mobile transporters, such as UAVs, to
establish indirect communication channels between the server and clients. These
transporters act as intermediaries and allow for model information exchange.
The use of indirect communication presents new challenges for convergence
analysis and optimization, as the delay introduced by the transporters'
movement creates issues for both global model dissemination and local model
collection. To address this, two algorithms, FedEx-Sync and FedEx-Async, are
proposed for synchronized and asynchronized learning at the transporter level.
Additionally, a bi-level optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the joint

on various issues and also in the way, get exposed to others' opinions. Be it
for selective exposure of news feed recommendation algorithms or our own
inclination to listen to opinions that support ours, the result is that we get
more and more exposed to opinions closer to ours. Further, any population is
inherently heterogeneous i.e. people will hold a varied range of opinions
regarding a topic and showcase a varied range of openness to get influenced by
others. In this paper, we demonstrate the different behavior put forward by
open- and close-minded agents towards an issue, when allowed to freely intermix
and communicate.
  We have shown that the intermixing among people leads to formation of opinion
echo chambers i.e. a small closed network of people who hold similar opinions
and are not affected by opinions of people outside the network. Echo chambers
are evidently harmful for a society because it inhibits free healthy
communication among all and thus, prevents exchange of opinions, spreads
misinformation and increases extremist beliefs. This calls for reduction in
echo chambers, because a total consensus of opinion is neither possible nor is
welcome. We show that the number of echo chambers depends on the number of
close-minded agents and cannot be lessened by increasing the number of
open-minded agents. We identify certain 'moderate'-minded agents, who possess
the capability of manipulating and reducing the number of echo chambers. The
paper proposes an algorithm for intelligent placement of moderate-minded agents
in the opinion-time spectrum by which the opinion echo chambers can be
maximally reduced. With various experimental setups, we demonstrate that the
proposed algorithm fares well when compared to placement of other agents (open-

spin-orbit coupling in the two-dimensional (2D) layered bismuth-based
oxyselenide, Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$Se, makes it a potential material for spintronic
devices. However, its spin-related properties have not been extensively studied
due to the centrosymmetric nature of its crystal structure. By using
first-principles density-functional theory calculation, this study reports the
emergence of Rashba-spin-valley states in Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$Se monolayer (ML).
Breaking the crystal inversion symmetry of Bi$_{2}$O$_{2}$Se ML using an
external electric field enables the Rashba-spin-valley formation, causing the
appearance of the Rashba-type splitting around the $\Gamma$ valley and
spin-valley coupling at the $D$ valleys located near the middle of $\Gamma-M$
line. In addition to the typical Rashba-type spin textures around the $\Gamma$
valley, the study also observed in-plane unidirectional spin textures around
the $D$ valleys, which is a rare phenomenon in 2D materials. The observed
Rashba-spin-valley states are driven by the lowering point group symmetry of
the crystal from $D_{4h}$ to $C_{4v}$ enforced by the electric field, as
clarified through $\vec{k}\cdot\vec{p}$ model derived from symmetry analysis.
More importantly, tuning the Rashba and spin-valley states by using biaxial
strain offers a promising route to regulate the spin textures and spin

reveal the complex origin of the anomalous Hall effect arising in noncollinear
antiferromagnets by performing Hall measurements with fields applied in
selected directions in space with respect to the crystalline axes. Our coplanar
magnetic field geometry goes beyond the conventional perpendicular field
geometry used for ferromagnets and allows us to suppress any magnetic dipole
contribution. It allows us to map the in-plane anomalous Hall contribution and
we demonstrate a 120$^\circ$ symmetry which we find to be governed by the
octupole moment at high fields. At low fields we subsequently discover a
surprising topological Hall-like signature and, from a combination of
theoretical techniques, we show that the spins can be recast into dipole,
emergent octupole and noncoplanar effective magnetic moments. These co-existing
orders enable magnetization dynamics unachievable in either ferromagnetic or

However, most of the existing models learn the geometric representation in an
implicit way, which has been found insufficient for the RE task since geometric
information is especially crucial for RE. Moreover, we reveal another factor
that limits the performance of RE lies in the objective gap between the
pre-training phase and the fine-tuning phase for RE. To tackle these issues, we

GeoLayoutLM explicitly models the geometric relations in pre-training, which we

specially designed geometry-related pre-training tasks. Additionally, novel
relation heads, which are pre-trained by the geometric pre-training tasks and
fine-tuned for RE, are elaborately designed to enrich and enhance the feature

GeoLayoutLM achieves highly competitive scores in the SER task and

labeled target samples. Compared with UDA, the key to SSDA lies how to most
effectively utilize the few labeled target samples. Existing SSDA approaches
simply merge the few precious labeled target samples into vast labeled source
samples or further align them, which dilutes the value of labeled target
samples and thus still obtains a biased model. To remedy this, in this paper,
we propose to decouple SSDA as an UDA problem and a semi-supervised learning

target samples and then adapt the learned UDA model in a semi-supervised way
using labeled and unlabeled target samples. By utilizing the labeled source

computes possible outputs of a program given inputs, while the backward
abstract interpretation computes possible inputs of a program given outputs. By
iteratively performing the two abstract interpretations in an alternating
fashion, we can effectively determine if any completion of each partial program
as a candidate can satisfy the input-output examples. We apply our approach to
a standard formulation, syntax-guided synthesis (SyGuS), thereby supporting a
wide range of inductive synthesis tasks. We have implemented our approach and
evaluated it on a set of benchmarks from the prior work. The experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches thanks to the sophisticated abstract interpretation techniques.

a cluster-level CVCL strategy is presented to explore consistent semantic label

learning to normalize each input sample. Our learning-based normalization

holistic shape reconstruction (HSR) of complex objects utilizing a
Single-Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD)-based time-of-flight sensor. As
illustrated in Fig. 1, our method enables new capabilities to reconstruct
near-$360^\circ$ surrounding geometry of an object from a single scan spot. In
such a scenario, traditional line-of-sight (LOS) imaging methods only see the
front part of the object and typically fail to recover the occluded back
regions. Inspired by recent advances of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging
techniques which have demonstrated great power to reconstruct occluded objects,
Omni-LOS marries LOS and NLOS together, leveraging their complementary
advantages to jointly recover the holistic shape of the object from a single
scan position. The core of our method is to put the object nearby diffuse walls
and augment the LOS scan in the front view with the NLOS scans from the
surrounding walls, which serve as virtual ``mirrors'' to trap lights toward the
object. Instead of separately recovering the LOS and NLOS signals, we adopt an
implicit neural network to represent the object, analogous to NeRF and NeTF.
While transients are measured along straight rays in LOS but over the spherical
wavefronts in NLOS, we derive differentiable ray propagation models to
simultaneously model both types of transient measurements so that the NLOS
reconstruction also takes into account the direct LOS measurements and vice
versa. We further develop a proof-of-concept Omni-LOS hardware prototype for
real-world validation. Comprehensive experiments on various wall settings
demonstrate that Omni-LOS successfully resolves shape ambiguities caused by
occlusions, achieves high-fidelity 3D scan quality, and manages to recover
objects of various scales and complexity.

the alkali modifier on the surface properties depends strongly on the nature of
the surface. The FS exhibits a monotonic increase of modifier concentration
with increasing alkali size while the MS shows a saturation of alkali
concentration when going from Na to K glasses, indicating the presence of two
competing mechanism that influence the properties of a MS. For the FS, we find
that larger alkali ions reduce the concentration of under-coordinated Si atoms
and increase the fraction of two-membered rings, implying an enhanced chemical
reactivity of the surface. For both types of surfaces, the roughness is found
to increase with alkali size, with the effect being more pronounced for the FS

scaling behavior that is independent of the alkali species considered: The ones
for the MS are compatible with the prediction of the frozen capillary wave

Flexible Model Poisoning Attack (FMPA) that can achieve versatile attack goals.
We consider a practical threat scenario where no extra knowledge about the FL
system (e.g., aggregation rules or updates on benign devices) is available to
adversaries. FMPA exploits the global historical information to construct an
estimator that predicts the next round of the global model as a benign
reference. It then fine-tunes the reference model to obtain the desired
poisoned model with low accuracy and small perturbations. Besides the goal of
causing DoS, FMPA can be naturally extended to launch a fine-grained
controllable attack, making it possible to precisely reduce the global
accuracy. Armed with precise control, malicious FL service providers can gain
advantages over their competitors without getting noticed, hence opening a new
attack surface in FL other than DoS. Even for the purpose of DoS, experiments
show that FMPA significantly decreases the global accuracy, outperforming six

particular, eye-tracking-while-reading data has been argued to bear the
potential to make machine-learning-based language models exhibit a more
human-like linguistic behavior. However, one of the main challenges in modeling
human scanpaths in reading is their dual-sequence nature: the words are ordered
following the grammatical rules of the language, whereas the fixations are
chronologically ordered. As humans do not strictly read from left-to-right, but
rather skip or refixate words and regress to previous words, the alignment of
the linguistic and the temporal sequence is non-trivial. In this paper, we
develop Eyettention, the first dual-sequence model that simultaneously
processes the sequence of words and the chronological sequence of fixations.
The alignment of the two sequences is achieved by a cross-sequence attention
mechanism. We show that Eyettention outperforms state-of-the-art models in

algorithms that draw inspiration from diverse fields such as Electrical and
Electronic Engineering, Information Theory, Differential Geometry, and Neural
Network architectures. We provide a complete overview of the existing data
encoding schemes and show how to use them in Genomics. The algorithms provided
utilise lossless compression, wavelet-based encoding, and information entropy.
Moreover, we propose a contemporary method for testing encoded DNA sequences
using Quantum Boltzmann Machines. To evaluate the effectiveness of our

for testing against real-world scenarios. Our research contributes to
developing classical-to-quantum data encoding methods in the science of

  drip-line",,,,,"nucl-th nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: The pairing correlation in weakly bound nuclei causes a mixing
among bound and unbound configurations. A remarkable consequence is emergence
of the quasiparticle resonance, which has been predicted with the coordinate
space Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) theory, but not yet observed
experimentally. Purpose: We discuss possible observation of quasiparticle
resonances in decay spectrum of unbound nuclei near the neutron drip-line. We
deal with an example of unbound nucleus ${}^{21}$C which disintegrates to
${}^{20}$C and a neutron. Method: We describe a scattering state consisting of
${}^{20}$C and a neutron in the framework of the HFB formalism. We assume that
a nucleon knockout reaction produces a doorway state of the decay, and we
evaluate the decay spectrum by taking an overlap of the doorway state and the
scattering state of ${}^{20}\mathrm{C}+n$. A numerical calculation was
performed with the Woods-Saxon potential and a density-dependent effective
pairing interaction. Results: We show that the quasiparticle resonance appears
as low-lying peaks in the decay spectrum of ${}^{21}$C. They originate from the
weakly bound single-neutron orbits $2s_{1/2}$ and $1d_{5/2}$, but emerge as
unbound resonant quasiparticle states under the influence of the neutron
pairing correlation. The resonance energy and the width of the calculated
quasiparticle resonances are consistent with an experimental observation
whereas they are sensitive to the neutron pairing correlation. Conclusion: The
results suggest that nucleon knockout reactions populating the unbound nucleus
${}^{21}\mathrm{C}$ provide realistic opportunity of experimentally observing
the quasiparticle resonance and of disclosing the pairing correlation in
neutron-rich nuclei.

fixing, which avoids both problems. In particular, this allows to show that
important physical features, like the counting of the degrees of freedom, do
not depend on a particular gauge choice, as expected. Moreover, the resulting

pancreatic tissue fragments are then stained to classify whether they are
pancreatic cancer. However, staining and visual inspection are time consuming.
In addition, if the pancreatic tissue fragment cannot be examined after
staining, the collection must be done again on the other day. Therefore, our
purpose is to classify from an unstained image whether it is available for
examination or not, and to exceed the accuracy of visual classification by
specialist physicians. Image classification before staining can reduce the time
required for staining and the burden of patients. However, the images of
pancreatic tissue fragments used in this study cannot be successfully
classified by processing the entire image because the pancreatic tissue
fragments are only a part of the image. Therefore, we propose a
DeformableFormer that uses Deformable Convolution in MetaFormer framework. The
architecture consists of a generalized model of the Vision Transformer, and we
use Deformable Convolution in the TokenMixer part. In contrast to existing
approaches, our proposed DeformableFormer is possible to perform feature
extraction more locally and dynamically by Deformable Convolution. Therefore,
it is possible to perform suitable feature extraction for classifying target.
To evaluate our method, we classify two categories of pancreatic tissue
fragments; available and unavailable for examination. We demonstrated that our
method outperformed the accuracy by specialist physicians and conventional

work, we study entanglement-assisted communication over classical network
channels. When there is asymmetry such that noise introduced by the channel
depends on the input alphabets, non communicating senders may exploit shared
entangled states to overcome the noise. We consider multiple access channels,
an essential building block for many complex networks, and develop an extensive
framework for n-senders and 1-receiver multiple access channels based on
nonlocal games. We obtain generic results for computing correlation assisted
sum-capacities of these channels. The considered channels introduce less noise
on winning and more noise on losing the game, and the correlation assistance is
classified as local (L), quantum (Q), or no-signaling (NS). Furthermore, we
consider a broad class of multiple access channels such as depolarizing ones
that admix a uniform noise with some probability and prove general results on
their sum-capacities. Finally, we apply our analysis to three specific
depolarizing multiple access channels based on Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt,
magic square, and Mermin-GHZ nonlocal games. In all three cases we find
significant enhancements in sum-capacities on using nonlocal correlations. We
obtain either exact expressions for sum-capacities or suitable upper and lower
bounds on them. The general framework developed in this work has much wider

Nozaki-Bekki soliton. These dissipative waveforms emerge in a family of
traveling localized dark pulses, known within the famed complex Ginzburg-Landau

programming, primal-dual relationships, local search heuristics etc. do not
scale for a large supply chain system involving millions of decision variables.
Using the concepts of sub-modularity and optimal transport theory, we present a
scalable algorithm for determining the set of facilities to be opened under a
cardinality constraint. By introducing various schemes such as: (i) iterative
facility selection using incremental gain, (ii) approximation of the linear
program using novel multi-stage Sinkhorn iterations, (iii) creation of

unusual non-monotonic wave number dependence, where $d\omega_0/dq < 0$, at
intermediate $q$, under strong coupling conditions. This effect was
subsequently explained by the pair alignment of electrons %at an intermediate
range of wave numbers [T. Dornheim \textit{et al.}, Comm. Phys. \textbf{5}, 304

roton-type behavior known from superfluids should be observable in a dense,
partially ionized hydrogen plasma. Based on a combination of path integral
Monte Carlo simulations and linear response results for the density response

a UAV-based aerial disaster image classification dataset and demonstrate that
it outperforms the baseline by up to 15 times in terms of classification

decreasing trend with some variations due to minor outbursts. The linear
spin-down rate is $\sim-1.9\times10^{-12}$ Hz/s during the period of lowest
luminosity, from which one can infer a dipole field $\sim1.75\times10^{13}$ G.
The $\dot{\nu}-L$ relation during the spin-down regime is complex, and the
$\dot{\nu}$ is close to 0 when the luminosity reaches both the high end
($L_{38}\sim0.3$) and the lowest value ($L_{38}\sim0.03$). The luminosity of
zero-torque is different for the giant outburst and other minor outbursts. It
is likely due to different accretion flows for different types of outburst, as
evidenced by the differences of the spectra and pulse profiles at a similar
luminosity for different types of outburst (giant or not). The pulse profile
changes from double peaks in the spin-up state to a single broad peak in the
low spin-down regime, indicating the emission beam/region is larger in the low
spin-down regime. These results show that accretion is still ongoing in the low
spin-down regime for which the neutron star is supposed to be in a propeller

to the idea of creating synthetic datasets to alleviate risk, bias, harm, and
privacy concerns inherent in the real data. This concept relies on Generative
AI models to produce unbiased, privacy-preserving synthetic data while being
true to the real data. In this new paradigm, how can we tell if this approach
delivers on its promises? We present an auditing framework that offers a
holistic assessment of synthetic datasets and AI models trained on them,
centered around bias and discrimination prevention, fidelity to the real data,
utility, robustness, and privacy preservation. We showcase our framework by
auditing multiple generative models on diverse use cases, including education,

tabular, to time-series, to natural language. Our use cases demonstrate the
importance of a holistic assessment in order to ensure compliance with
socio-technical safeguards that regulators and policymakers are increasingly

synthetic datasets based on their prescribed safeguards and their desired
trade-offs. Moreover, we devise a trust-index-driven model selection and
cross-validation procedure via auditing in the training loop that we showcase
on a class of transformer models that we dub TrustFormers, across different
modalities. This trust-driven model selection allows for controllable trust
trade-offs in the resulting synthetic data. We instrument our auditing

we review the two common benchmarks and observe that they are insufficient to
assess the true capability of models on fine-grained cross-modal semantic

benchmarks are coarse-grained. Based on the observation, we renovate the
coarse-grained images and texts in the old benchmarks and establish the
improved benchmarks called MSCOCO-FG and Flickr30K-FG. Specifically, on the

two components, i.e. face embeddings enhancement using the embeddings from

information extraction. The embeddings are combined to predict the linkage
probabilities for all node pairs to replace the cosine similarities to produce
new subgraphs that can be further used for aggregation of GCNs or other

examines the nearby attack nodes and conceals the trusted node in the routing

us to determine the temperature dependence of the IS vibrational spectra under
thermal conditions as well as the time evolution of the non-equilibrium
transient spectra induced by femtosecond laser pulses. Under thermal conditions
(i.e., for equal electronic $T_e$ and phononic $T_l$ temperatures), the
calculated lifetimes at 10-150~K are mostly due to nonadiabatic couplings (NC),
i.e., first-order electronic excitations. As temperature increases, also the
contribution of the second-order electron mediated phonon-phonon couplings
(EMPPC) progressively increases from 25\% at low temperatures to 50\% at 300~K.
Our calculations for the laser-induced non-equilibrium conditions comprise
experimental absorbed fluences of 6-130~J/m$^2$. For fluences for which
$T_e>$2000~K, the transient vibrational spectra are characterized by two
different regimes that follow the distinct time-evolution of $T_e$ and $T_l$

the initial fast regime becomes progressively negligible as $T_e$ decreases and
only the steady second regime remains visible. Qualitatively, all these

ejections could happen just after the slim disk emerging from the standard disk
at some distance runs over the standard disk and reaches the vicinity of the
central black hole. The standard disk releases about a half of the
gravitational energy in the course of the accretion, but the released radiative
energy could be absorbed by the optically thick slim disk covering the standard
disk in this situation. Then, since the inward motion of the slim disk is much
faster than that of the standard disk, a quantity of energy released by an
amount of gas in the standard disk is received by the much smaller amount of
gas in the slim disk. As the result, the energy per mass received by the slim
disk is expected to be largely amplified and is estimated to get highly
relativistic. Since the energy is much larger than the gravitational energy,
the height of the slim disk could significantly increase. Hence, the innermost
part of the slim disk from which almost all the angular momentum has been
transferred outward could have a much larger height than the black hole size
and collide with one another around the central axis of the disk, turning to an
outward flow along the axis normal to the disk plane. The flow in this
direction can be approximated to be that through the de Laval nozzle and could
become supersonic near the distance where the flow has the smallest cross
section.

conduct a mathematical runtime analysis of the MA on the CLIFF benchmark. Apart
from one local optimum, cliff functions are monotonically increasing towards
the global optimum. Consequently, to optimize a cliff function, the MA only
once needs to accept an inferior solution. Despite seemingly being an ideal
benchmark for the MA to profit from its main working principle, our
mathematical runtime analysis shows that this hope does not come true. Even
with the optimal temperature (the only parameter of the MA), the MA optimizes
most cliff functions less efficiently than simple elitist evolutionary
algorithms (EAs), which can only leave the local optimum by generating a
superior solution possibly far away. This result suggests that our
understanding of why the MA is often very successful in practice is not yet

consists of scenes with a high number of vehicles, and it can be challenging to
determine which are the most critical vehicles regarding the safety of an ego
vehicle. Therefore, we present the inverse universal traffic quality, a
criticality metric for urban traffic independent of predefined adversary
vehicles and vehicle constellations such as intersection trajectories or
car-following scenarios. Our metric is universally applicable for different
urban traffic situations, e.g., intersections or roundabouts, and can be
adjusted to certain situations if needed. Additionally, in this paper, we
evaluate the proposed metric and compares its result to other well-known
criticality metrics of this field, such as time-to-collision or

In this work, we demonstrate an adversarial machine learning algorithm to
determine the parameters of a quantum dot-based Kitaev chain. We train a
convolutional conditional generative adversarial neural network (Conv-cGAN)
with simulated differential conductance data and use the model to predict the
parameters at which Majorana bound states are predicted to appear. In
particular, the Conv-cGAN model facilitates a rapid, numerically efficient
exploration of the phase diagram describing the transition between elastic
co-tunneling and crossed Andreev reflection regimes. We verify the theoretical
predictions of the model by applying it to experimentally measured conductance
obtained from a minimal Kitaev chain consisting of two spin-polarized quantum
dots coupled by a superconductor-semiconductor hybrid. Our model accurately
predicts, with an average success probability of $97$\%, whether the
measurement was taken in the elastic co-tunneling or crossed Andreev

then emerges: as the HRIS operates concurrently with the communication

representations of workload-allocator interaction. We use two-dimensional
rectangular bin packing (2DBP) as our foundation. Classical 2DBP algorithms
minimize their products' makespan, but virtual memory systems employing demand
paging deem such a criterion inappropriate. We view an allocator's placement
decisions as a solution to a 2DBP instance, optimizing some unknown criterion
particular to that allocator's policy. Our end product is a compact data
structure that fits e.g. the simulation of 80 million requests in a 350 MiB
file. By design, it is concerned with events residing entirely in virtual
memory; no information on memory accesses, indexing costs or any other factor
is kept.
  We bootstrap our contribution's significance by exploring its relationship to
maximum resident set size (RSS). Our baseline is the assumption that less
fragmentation amounts to smaller peak RSS. We thus define a fragmentation
metric in the 2DBP substrate and compute it for 28 workloads linked to 4 modern
allocators. We also measure peak RSS for the 112 resulting pairs. Our metric
exhibits a strong monotonic relationship (Spearman coefficient $\rho>0.65$) in
half of those cases: allocators achieving better 2DBP placements yield
$9\%$-$30\%$ smaller peak RSS, with the trends remaining consistent across two
different machines.
  Considering our representation's minimalism, the presented empirical evidence
is a robust indicator of its potency. If workload-allocator interplay in the
virtual address space suffices to evaluate a novel fragmentation definition,
numerous other useful applications of our tool can be studied. Both augmenting
2DBP and exploring alternative computations on it provide ample fertile ground
for future research.

of the starless cores were identified with the gravitationally bound prestellar
cores. The exponent of the CMF (alpha = 1.35) is identical to that of the
Salpeter IMF. We selected 68 filaments with at least one side that appeared not
blended with adjacent structures. The filament widths are in the range of 0.15
pc to 0.63 pc, and have a median value of W = 0.3(0.11) pc. The surface
densities of filaments are well correlated with their contrasts and linear
densities. Within uncertainties of the filament instability criterion, many
filaments may well be both supercritical and subcritical. A large fraction of
filaments may definitely be considered supercritical, in which are found 94
prestellar cores, 83 protostellar cores, and only 1 unbound starless core.
Taking into account the uncertainties, the supercritical filaments contain only
prestellar and protostellar cores. Our findings support the idea that there
exists a direct relationship between the CMF and IMF and that filaments play a
key role in the formation of prestellar cores, which is consistent with the
previous Herschel results.

automatic speech recognition (ASR) and spoken language understanding (SLU)
tasks. The proposed NAR systems employ a Conformer encoder that applies
connectionist temporal classification (CTC) to transcribe the speech utterance
into raw ASR hypotheses, which are further refined with a bidirectional encoder
representations from Transformers (BERT)-like decoder. In the meantime, the
intent and slot labels of the utterance are predicted simultaneously using the
same decoder. Both Mask-CTC and self-conditioned CTC (SC-CTC) approaches are
explored for this study. Experiments conducted on the SLURP dataset show that
the proposed SC-Mask-CTC NAR system achieves 3.7% and 3.2% absolute gains in
SLU metrics and a competitive level of ASR accuracy, when compared to a
Conformer-Transformer based autoregressive (AR) model. Additionally, the NAR
systems achieve 6x faster decoding speed than the AR baseline.

are not so accurate and reliable. Reconstruction-based methods are better

unable to match the performance of deep learning models for SISR. This study
examines the Residual Dense Networks architecture proposed by Yhang et al. [17]
and analyzes the importance of its components. By leveraging hierarchical
features from original low-resolution (LR) images, this architecture achieves
superior performance, with a network structure comprising four main blocks,
including the residual dense block (RDB) as the core. Through investigations of

X-ray flares and fast radio bursts (FRBs) have been observed from the magnetar

Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations to get the NS structure. With spin-down of
the NS, the hadronic shell gradually transfers to the quark shell.The
gravitational potential energy released by one time of the phase transition can
be achieved. The released energy, time interval between two successive phase
transitions, and glitch are all consistent with the observations of the FRBs

illustrated, a convenient variational quantity in that approach is the
``screening'' or ``electron repulsion'' density, $\rho_{\rm rep}$,
corresponding to the local, KS Hartree, exchange and correlation potential

largely remove self-interaction errors from the effective potential: (i)
$\rho_{\rm rep}$ integrates to $N-1$, where $N$ is the number of electrons, and
(ii) $\rho_{\rm rep}\geq 0$ everywhere. In the present work, we introduce an
effective ``screening'' amplitude, $f$, as the variational quantity, with the

problem becomes more efficient and robust. We apply this technique to molecular
calculations employing several approximations in DFT and in reduced density
matrix functional theory. We find that the proposed development is an accurate,

vulnerability of modern CPU optimization technologies. New attacks surface
rapidly. The side-channel is a key part of transient execution attacks to leak

register in transient execution may have a side effect on the Jcc (jump on
condition code) instruction after it in Intel CPUs. Based on our discovery, we
propose a new side-channel attack that leverages the timing of both transient
execution and Jcc instructions to deliver data. This attack encodes secret data
to the change of register which makes the execution time of context slightly
slower, which can be measured by the attacker to decode data. This attack
doesn't rely on the cache system and doesn't need to reset the EFLAGS register
manually to its initial state before the attack, which may make it more
difficult to detect or mitigate. We implemented this side-channel on machines
with Intel Core i7-6700, i7-7700, and i9-10980XE CPUs. In the first two
processors, we combined it as the side-channel of the Meltdown attack, which
could achieve 100\% success leaking rate. We evaluate and discuss potential
defenses against the attack. Our contributions include discovering security
vulnerabilities in the implementation of Jcc instructions and EFLAGS register

more than $i$ apart. A \emph{packing colouring} of $G$ is a partition
$X=\{X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{k}\}$ of $V(G)$ such that each colour class $X_{i}$
is an $i$-packing. The minimum order $k$ of a packing colouring is called the
packing chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\chi_{\rho}(G)$. In this paper we
investigate the existence of trees $T$ for which there is only one packing

completely characterise all such trees. As a by-product we obtain sets of

prospect in building an interactive intelligent traffic system (ITS). Current
solutions mainly focus on extracting both text and image features and mapping
them to the same latent space to compare the similarity. However, existing
methods usually use dependency analysis or semantic role-labelling techniques
to find keywords related to vehicle attributes. These techniques may require a
lot of pre-processing and post-processing work, and also suffer from extracting
the wrong keyword when the NL query is complex. To tackle these problems and
simplify, we borrow the idea from named entity recognition (NER) and construct
FindVehicle, a NER dataset in the traffic domain. It has 42.3k labelled NL
descriptions of vehicle tracks, containing information such as the location,
orientation, type and colour of the vehicle. FindVehicle also adopts both
overlapping entities and fine-grained entities to meet further requirements. To
verify its effectiveness, we propose a baseline NL-based vehicle retrieval

pre-trained by FindVehicle, VehicleFinder achieves 87.7\% precision and 89.4\%

graphs, i.e., graphs in which edges tend to connect nodes of the same type.
Yet, achievement of consistent GNN performance on heterophilous graphs remains
an open research problem. Recent works have proposed extensions to standard GNN
architectures to improve performance on heterophilous graphs, trading off model
simplicity for prediction accuracy. However, these models fail to capture basic
graph properties, such as neighborhood label distribution, which are
fundamental for learning. In this work, we propose GCN for Heterophily (GCNH),
a simple yet effective GNN architecture applicable to both heterophilous and
homophilous scenarios. GCNH learns and combines separate representations for a
node and its neighbors, using one learned importance coefficient per layer to
balance the contributions of center nodes and neighborhoods. We conduct
extensive experiments on eight real-world graphs and a set of synthetic graphs
with varying degrees of heterophily to demonstrate how the design choices for
GCNH lead to a sizable improvement over a vanilla GCN. Moreover, GCNH
outperforms state-of-the-art models of much higher complexity on four out of
eight benchmarks, while producing comparable results on the remaining datasets.
Finally, we discuss and analyze the lower complexity of GCNH, which results in
fewer trainable parameters and faster training times than other methods, and
show how GCNH mitigates the oversmoothing problem.

Due to its non-convexity, this problem is challenging, but it attracts more and

based on monotonic optimization combined with a recent neurodynamic approach,
where the solution set of the lower-level problem is inner approximated by
copolyblocks in outcome space. From that, the upper-level problem is solved
using the branch-and-bound method. Finding the bounds is converted to
pseudoconvex programming problems, which are solved using the neurodynamic
method. The algorithm's convergence is proved, and computational experiments

continuously to allow platforms to estimate the causal effect of replacing
system variant ""A"" with variant ""B"", on some metric of interest. These variants
can differ in many aspects. In this paper, we focus on the common use-case
where they correspond to machine learning models. The online experiment then
serves as the final arbiter to decide which model is superior, and should thus
be shipped.
  The statistical literature on causal effect estimation from RCTs has a
substantial history, which contributes deservedly to the level of trust
researchers and practitioners have in this ""gold standard"" of evaluation
practices. Nevertheless, in the particular case of machine learning
experiments, we remark that certain critical issues remain. Specifically, the
assumptions that are required to ascertain that A/B-tests yield unbiased
estimates of the causal effect, are seldom met in practical applications. We
argue that, because variants typically learn using pooled data, a lack of model
interference cannot be guaranteed. This undermines the conclusions we can draw
from online experiments with machine learning models. We discuss the
implications this has for practitioners, and for the research literature.

that, similar to the ordinary space-like entanglement entropy in BCFT, the

light cone of the mirror image of the other endpoint. We determine the phase
diagram for the time-like entanglement entropy. We find that while the
time-like entropy is complex in the bulk phase and has a boundary term in the
boundary phase, there is no boundary entropy in the Regge phase. Moreover, it
can be real or complex depending on which side the Regge limit is approached
from. On the gravity side, we obtain the holographic time-like entanglement

law of the solutions in two distinct topologies. We prove ULDP in the
$\mathrm{C}([0,T];\mathrm{L}^p(\mathbb{T}^2))$ topology, for $p>2$, taking into

helps in learning by guiding function approximation based on the state
transition of the expert's trajectories. Third, the discriminator solves a
learning issue commonly present in the policy model, which is to sometimes
perform a `no action' within the environment until the agent finally halts.

First, we demonstrate how to construct a distributed controller for systems

we address the dynamic matching problem of two distinct groups of agents with
different sensing ranges. This problem is a novel coordination task that
involves pairing agents from two distinct groups to achieve a convergence of
the paired agents' states to the same value. Accordingly, we apply the proposed

  After showing that the problem is globally well-posed, we demonstrate that

$\Delta_1 \approx 0.00297$. We explicitly construct these spatially-periodic

leading order, of regularly-spaced, compactly-supported regions with width of
$O(1)$ where $u=O(1)$, separated by regions where $u$ is exponentially small at
leading order as $D \to 0^+$.

travelling waves, with minimum wavespeed, $2 \sqrt{D}$, are generated, whilst
for $0 < D < \Delta_1$, the wavefronts generated separate the regions where

integrated luminosity of 750 $\mu{\rm b}^{-1}$ $\pm$ 5% (syst) is analysed.
Hadronic activity is highly suppressed since the interaction is mediated by a

Massive Particles (MIMPs). Their unique track signature allows a targeted
analysis with only 0.05 expected background events from muons. Following
unblinding, we observe no signal candidate events. This work places strong
constraints on spin-independent interactions of dark matter particles with a
mass between 1$\times$10$^{12}\,$GeV/c$^2$ and 2$\times$10$^{17}\,$GeV/c$^2$.
In addition, we present the first exclusion limits on spin-dependent
MIMP-neutron and MIMP-proton cross-sections for dark matter particles with

for correlation between the high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by the
IceCube Observatory and gamma-ray photons detected by the Fermi Large Area
Telescope (LAT). So far, only sources detected by the LAT have been considered
in correlation with IceCube neutrinos, neglecting any emission from sources too
faint to be resolved individually. Here, we present the first cross-correlation
analysis considering the unresolved gamma-ray background (UGRB) and IceCube
events. We perform a thorough sensitivity study and, given the lack of
identified correlation, we place upper limits on the fraction of the observed
neutrinos that would be produced in proton-proton (p-p) or proton-gamma
(p-gamma) interactions from the population of sources contributing to the UGRB
emission and dominating its spatial anisotropy (aka blazars). Our analysis
suggests that, under the assumption that there is no intrinsic cutoff and/or
hardening of the spectrum above Fermi-LAT energies, and that all gamma-rays
from the unresolved blazars dominating the UGRB fluctuation field are produced
by neutral pions from p-p (p-gamma) interactions, up to 60% (30%) of such
population may contribute to the total neutrino events observed by IceCube.
This translates into a O(1%) maximum contribution to the astrophysical
high-energy neutrino flux observed by IceCube at 100 TeV.

  View of Learning",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep metric learning aims to construct an embedding space where samples of
the same class are close to each other, while samples of different classes are
far away from each other. Most existing deep metric learning methods attempt to
maximize the difference of inter-class features. And semantic related
information is obtained by increasing the distance between samples of different
classes in the embedding space. However, compressing all positive samples
together while creating large margins between different classes unconsciously
destroys the local structure between similar samples. Ignoring the intra-class
variance contained in the local structure between similar samples, the
embedding space obtained from training receives lower generalizability over
unseen classes, which would lead to the network overfitting the training set
and crashing on the test set. To address these considerations, this paper
designs a self-supervised generative assisted ranking framework that provides a
semi-supervised view of intra-class variance learning scheme for typical
supervised deep metric learning. Specifically, this paper performs sample
synthesis with different intensities and diversity for samples satisfying
certain conditions to simulate the complex transformation of intra-class
samples. And an intra-class ranking loss function is designed using the idea of
self-supervised learning to constrain the network to maintain the intra-class
distribution during the training process to capture the subtle intra-class
variance. With this approach, a more realistic embedding space can be obtained
in which global and local structures of samples are well preserved, thus
enhancing the effectiveness of downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on four

quantum information processing. Because full state tomography that determines
all elements of the density matrix is computationally demanding, one usually
takes the strategy of assuming a certain model of quantum states and
identifying the model parameters. However, it is difficult to make a valid
assumption given little prior knowledge on a quantum state of interest, and
thus we need a reasonable model selection method for quantum state estimation.
Actually, in the classical statistical estimation theory, several types of
information criteria have been established and widely used in practice for
appropriately choosing a classical statistical model. In this study, we propose
quantum information criteria for evaluating the quality of the estimated
quantum state in terms of the quantum relative entropy, which is a natural
quantum analogue of the classical information criterion defined in terms of
Kullback-Leibler divergence. In particular, we derive two quantum information
criteria depending on the type of estimator for the quantum relative entropy;
one uses the log-likelihood and the other uses the classical shadow. The
general role of information criteria is to predict the performance of an
estimated model for unseen data, although it is a function of only sampled

becomes more essential to devise efficient methods estimating the fidelity
between the ideal graph state and an experimentally-realized actual state. Any
efficient fidelity-estimation method, in general, must use multiple
experimental settings, i.e., needs to switch between at least two measurements.
Recently, it has been shown that a single measurement is sufficient if the
noise can be modeled as the phase-flip error. Since the bit-flip error should
also occur in several experiments, it is desired to extend this simplest method
to noise models that include phase and bit-flip errors. However, it seems to be
nontrivial because their result strongly depends on properties of the
phase-flip error. In this paper, by analyzing effects of the bit-flip error on
stabilizer operators of graph states, we achieve the extension to the
depolarizing noise, which is a major noise model including phase and bit-flip
errors. We also numerically evaluate our simplest method for noise models
interpolating between the phase-flip and depolarizing noises.

scattering mediated by an axion-like particle is presented, using the ATLAS
Forward Proton spectrometer to detect scattered protons and the central ATLAS
detector to detect pairs of outgoing photons. Proton-proton collision data
recorded in 2017 at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV were
analysed, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 14.6 fb$^{-1}$. A total
of 441 candidate signal events were selected. A search was made for a narrow
resonance in the diphoton mass distribution, corresponding to an axion-like
particle (ALP) with mass in the range 150-1600 GeV. No excess is observed above
a smooth background. Upper limits on the production cross section of a narrow
resonance are set as a function of the mass, and are interpreted as upper
limits on the ALP production coupling constant, assuming 100% decay branching
ratio into a photon pair. The inferred upper limit on the coupling constant is
in the range 0.04-0.09 TeV$^{-1}$ at 95%confidence level.

quasi-steady-state assumption with a point mass model constrained by
gg-diagrams. For its online applicability, we propose an efficient
representation of the gg-diagrams and identify negligible terms to reduce the

reproduce the lap times of an offline-generated racing line during single
vehicle racing. Moreover, it finds a new time-optimal solution when a deviation
from the original racing line is necessary, e.g., during an overtaking
maneuver. Motivated by the application in a rule-based race, we also consider
the scenario of a speed limit lower than the current vehicle velocity. We
introduce an initializable slack variable to generate feasible trajectories
despite the constraint violation while reducing the velocity to comply with the

  in Large-Scale Exploratory Signed Networks",,,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Signed network structure discovery has received extensive attention and has
become a research focus in the field of network science. However, most of the
existing studies are focused on the networks with a single structure, e.g.,
community or bipartite, while ignoring multiple structures, e.g., the
coexistence of community and bipartite structures. Furthermore, existing
studies were faced with challenge regarding large-scale signed networks due to
their high time complexity, especially when determining the number of clusters
in the observed network without any prior knowledge. In view of this, we
propose a mathematically principled method for signed network multiple
structure discovery named the Signed Stochastic Block Model (SSBM). The SSBM
can capture the multiple structures contained in signed networks, e.g.,
community, bipartite, and coexistence of them, by adopting a probabilistic
model. Moreover, by integrating the minimum message length (MML) criterion and
component-wise EM (CEM) algorithm, a scalable learning algorithm that has the
ability of model selection is proposed to handle large-scale signed networks.
By comparing state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real-world signed
networks, extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of SSBM in discovering large-scale exploratory signed networks with
multiple structures.

allows to represent data more compactly and, at the same time, speeds up search
queries on it. In this paper, we focus on the well-studied problem of sorting
and indexing string sets. Since the introduction of suffix trees in 1973,
dozens of suffix sorting algorithms have been described in the literature. In
2017, these techniques were extended to sets of strings described by means of
finite automata: the theory of Wheeler graphs [Gagie et al., TCS'17] introduced
automata whose states can be totally-sorted according to the co-lexicographic
(co-lex in the following) order of the prefixes of words accepted by the
automaton. More recently, in [Cotumaccio, Prezza, SODA'21] it was shown how to
extend these ideas to arbitrary automata by means of partial co-lex orders.
This work showed that a co-lex order of minimum width (thus optimizing search
query times) on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) can be computed in $O(m^2
+ n^{5/2})$ time, $m$ being the number of transitions and $n$ the number of
states of the input DFA.
  In this paper, we exhibit new combinatorial properties of the minimum-width
co-lex order of DFAs and exploit them to design faster prefix sorting
algorithms. In particular, we describe two algorithms sorting arbitrary DFAs in
$O(mn)$ and $O(n^2\log n)$ time, respectively, and an algorithm sorting acyclic
DFAs in $O(m\log n)$ time. Within these running times, all algorithms compute
also a smallest chain partition of the partial order (required to index the
DFA). We present an experiment result to show that an optimized implementation
of the $O(n^2\log n)$-time algorithm exhibits a nearly-linear behaviour on
large deterministic pan-genomic graphs and is thus also of practical interest.

both in systems with low barriers and in systems with anharmonic modes. We
demonstrate the applicability of RPI+PC to molecular systems by computing the
tunneling splitting in full-dimensional malonaldehyde and a deuterated
derivative. Comparing to both experiment and recent quantum-mechanical
benchmark results, we find that our perturbative correction reduces the error
from -11% to 2% for hydrogen transfer and performs even better for the
deuterated case. This makes our approach more accurate than previous
calculations using diffusion Monte Carlo and path-integral molecular dynamics,

coefficient taking any positive values $y=(y_1, \dots, y_d)\in ]0,\infty[^d$ on

elliptic as the contrast $\kappa(y)=\frac{\max y_j}{\min y_j}$ can be
arbitrarily high, contrarily to the Uniform Ellipticity Assumption (UEA) that
is commonly made on parametric elliptic PDEs. Based on local polynomial
approximations in the $y$ variable, we construct local and global reduced model
spaces $V_n$ of moderate dimension $n$ that approximate uniformly well all
solutions $u(y)$. Since the solution $u(y)$ blows as $y\to 0$, the solution
manifold is not a compact set and does not have finite $n$-width. Therefore,
our results for approximation by such spaces are formulated in terms of
relative $H^1_0$-projection error, that is, after normalization by
$\|u(y)\|_{H^1_0}$. We prove that this relative error decays exponentially with
$n$, yet exhibiting the curse of dimensionality as the number $d$ of subdomains
grows. We also show similar rates for the Galerkin projection despite the fact
that high contrast is well-known to deteriorate the multiplicative constant
when applying Cea's lemma. We finally establish uniform estimates in relative
error for the state estimation and parameter estimation inverse problems, when
$y$ is unknown and a limited number of linear measurements $\ell_i(u)$ are

convergence of $u(y)$ to limit solutions when some of the parameters $y_j$ tend

emotions expressed by others in social media posts. This affects the quality of
emotion identification methods due to training data size limitations and noise
in the production of labels used in model development. We present LEIA, a model
for emotion identification in text that has been trained on a dataset of more
than 6 million posts with self-annotated emotion labels for happiness,
affection, sadness, anger, and fear. LEIA is based on a word masking method
that enhances the learning of emotion words during model pre-training. LEIA
achieves macro-F1 values of approximately 73 on three in-domain test datasets,
outperforming other supervised and unsupervised methods in a strong benchmark
that shows that LEIA generalizes across posts, users, and time periods. We
further perform an out-of-domain evaluation on five different datasets of
social media and other sources, showing LEIA's robust performance across media,
data collection methods, and annotation schemes. Our results show that LEIA
generalizes its classification of anger, happiness, and sadness beyond the
domain it was trained on. LEIA can be applied in future research to provide
better identification of emotions in text from the perspective of the writer.

  Scattering in Granular Compacts",,,,,"physics.optics physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fundamental knowledge of scattering in granular compacts is essential to
ensure accuracy of spectroscopic measurements and determine material
characteristics such as size and shape of scattering objects. Terahertz
time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) was employed to investigate the effect of
particle size and concentration on scattering in specially fabricated compacts
consisting of borosilicate microspheres in a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)
matrix. As expected, increasing particle size leads to an increase in overall
scattering contribution. At low concentrations, the scattering contribution
increases linearly with concentration. Scattering increases linearly at low
concentrations, saturates at higher concentrations with a maximum level
depending on particle size, and that the onset of saturation is independent of
particle size. The effective refractive index becomes sublinear at high
particle concentrations and exceeds the linear model at maximum density, which
can cause errors in calculations based on it, such as porosity. The observed
phenomena are attributed to the change in the fraction of photons propagating
ballistically versus being scattered. At low concentrations, photons travel
predominately ballistically through the PTFE matrix. At high concentrations,
the photons again propagate ballistically through adjacent glass microspheres.
In the intermediate regime, photons are predominately scattered.

motion planning problem is divided into a deterministic motion planning problem
and a graph search problem. We solve the deterministic planning problem using
sampling-based methods such as PRM or RRG to construct a graph of nominal
trajectories. Then, an informed cost-to-go heuristic for the original problem
is computed based on the nominal trajectory graph. Finally, we grow a belief
tree by searching over the graph using the proposed heuristic. IBBT interleaves
between batch state sampling, nominal trajectory graph construction, heuristic
computing, and search over the graph to find belief space motion plans. IBBT is
an anytime, incremental algorithm. With an increasing number of batches of
samples added to the graph, the algorithm finds motion plans that converge to
the optimal one. IBBT is efficient by reusing results between sequential
iterations. The belief tree searching is an ordered search guided by an
informed heuristic. We test IBBT in different planning environments. Our
numerical investigation confirms that IBBT finds non-trivial motion plans and
is faster compared with previous similar methods.

over their security have emerged. Deep learning models are vulnerable to
backdoor attacks due to the lack of transparency. A poisoned backdoor model may
perform normally in routine environments, but exhibit malicious behavior when
the input contains a trigger. Current research on backdoor attacks focuses on
improving the stealthiness of triggers, and most approaches require strong
attacker capabilities, such as knowledge of the model structure or control over
the training process. These attacks are impractical since in most cases the
attacker's capabilities are limited. Additionally, the issue of model
robustness has not received adequate attention. For instance, model
distillation is commonly used to streamline model size as the number of
parameters grows exponentially, and most of previous backdoor attacks failed
after model distillation; the image augmentation operations can destroy the
trigger and thus disable the backdoor. This study explores the implementation
of black-box backdoor attacks within capability constraints. An attacker can
carry out such attacks by acting as either an image annotator or an image
provider, without involvement in the training process or knowledge of the
target model's structure. Through the design of a backdoor trigger, our attack
remains effective after model distillation and image augmentation, making it
more threatening and practical. Our experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves a high attack success rate in black-box scenarios and evades
state-of-the-art backdoor defenses.

discoveries or changes in the adopted methods of reasoning. Also, new facts or
evidence may become available, leading to new understandings of complex
phenomena. This is particularly true in the biomedical field, where scientists
and physicians are constantly striving to find new methods of diagnosis,
treatment and eventually cure. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a real way of
organizing and retrieving the massive and growing amount of biomedical
knowledge.
  Objective : We propose an end-to-end approach for knowledge extraction and
analysis from biomedical clinical notes using the Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) model and Conditional Random Field
(CRF) layer.
  Methods : The approach is based on knowledge graphs, which can effectively
process abstract biomedical concepts such as relationships and interactions
between medical entities. Besides offering an intuitive way to visualize these
concepts, KGs can solve more complex knowledge retrieval problems by
simplifying them into simpler representations or by transforming the problems
into representations from different perspectives. We created a biomedical
Knowledge Graph using using Natural Language Processing models for named entity
recognition and relation extraction. The generated biomedical knowledge graphs
(KGs) are then used for question answering.
  Results : The proposed framework can successfully extract relevant structured
information with high accuracy (90.7% for Named-entity recognition (NER), 88%
for relation extraction (RE)), according to experimental findings based on
real-world 505 patient biomedical unstructured clinical notes.
  Conclusions : In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end system for the
construction of a biomedical knowledge graph from clinical textual using a
variation of BERT models.

computer models as non-ideal gate-based quantum computer (NIGQC) models since
transmons are usually used as transmon qubits in superconducting prototype

quantum computer (IGQC) model and provide a distinction between the IGQC, PGQCs
and the NIGQC models we consider in this thesis. Then, we derive the circuit
Hamiltonians which generate the dynamics of fixed-frequency and flux-tunable
transmons. Furthermore, we also provide clear and concise derivations of
effective Hamiltonians for both types of transmons. We use the circuit and
effective Hamiltonians we derived to define two many-particle Hamiltonians,
namely a circuit and an associated effective Hamiltonian. The interactions
between the different subsystems are modelled as dipole-dipole interactions.
Next, we develop two product-formula algorithms which solve the TDSE for the
Hamiltonians we defined. Afterwards, we use these algorithms to investigate how
various frequently applied assumptions affect the time evolution of transmon
systems modelled with the many-particle effective Hamiltonian when a control
pulse is applied. Here we also compare the time evolutions generated by the
effective and circuit Hamiltonian. We find that the assumptions we investigate
can substantially affect the time evolution of the probability amplitudes we
model. Next, we investigate how susceptible gate-error quantifiers are to
assumptions which make up the NIGQC model. We find that the assumptions we

provide an algorithm executing $\mathcal{A}$ and whose expected running time is
$O(\ell^\star_p\log\ell^\star_p)$, where $\ell^\star_p=\Theta\left(\inf_{q\in
(0,1]}Q_p(q)/q\right)$ is the minimum expected running time achievable with
full prior knowledge of the probability distribution $p$, and $Q_p(q)$ is the
$q$-quantile of $p$. Moreover, the authors showed that the logarithmic term
could not be removed for universal restart strategies and was, in a certain
sense, optimal. In this work, we show that, quite surprisingly, the logarithmic
term can be replaced by a smaller quantity, thus reducing the expected running
time in practical settings of interest. More precisely, we propose a novel
restart strategy that executes $\mathcal{A}$ and whose expected running time is
$O\big(\inf_{q\in (0,1]}\frac{Q_p(q)}{q}\,\psi\big(\log Q_p(q),\,\log
(1/q)\big)\big)$ where $\psi(a,b)=1+\min\left\{a+b,a\log^2 a,\,b\log^2
b\right\}$. This quantity is, up to a multiplicative factor, better than: 1)
the universal restart strategy of [LSZ93], 2) any $q$-quantile of $p$ for
$q\in(0,1]$, 3) the original algorithm, and 4) any quantity of the form
$\phi^{-1}(\mathbb{E}[\phi(T)])$ for a large class of concave functions $\phi$.
The latter extends the recent restart strategy of [Zam22] achieving
$O\left(e^{\mathbb{E}[\ln(T)]}\right)$, and can be thought of as algorithmic
reverse Jensen's inequalities. Finally, we show that the behavior of
$\frac{t\phi''(t)}{\phi'(t)}$ at infinity controls the existence of reverse
Jensen's inequalities by providing a necessary and a sufficient condition for
these inequalities to hold.

construction tasks. The proposed system adapts ChatGPT for construction

gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. However, the assessment requires a trained
medical professional to perform multiple abdominal auscultation sessions, which
is resource-intense and may fail to provide an accurate picture of patients'
continuous GI wellbeing. This has generated a technological interest in
developing wearables for continuous capture of ABS, which enables a fuller
picture of patient's GI status to be obtained at reduced cost. This paper seeks
to evaluate the feasibility of extracting heart rate (HR) from such ABS
monitoring devices. The collection of HR directly from these devices would
enable gathering vital signs alongside GI data without the need for additional
wearable devices, providing further cost benefits and improving general
usability. We utilised a dataset containing 104 hours of ABS audio, collected
from the abdomen using an e-stethoscope, and electrocardiogram as ground truth.
Our evaluation shows for the first time that we can successfully extract HR
from audio collected from a wearable on the abdomen. As heart sounds collected
from the abdomen suffer from significant noise from GI and respiratory tracts,
we leverage wavelet denoising for improved heart beat detection. The mean
absolute error of the algorithm for average HR is 3.4 BPM with mean directional
error of -1.2 BPM over the whole dataset. A comparison to
photoplethysmography-based wearable HR sensors shows that our approach exhibits
comparable accuracy to consumer wrist-worn wearables for average and
instantaneous heart rate.

WASP-52, the companion planet has occulted starspots in the past, and as such
our aim was to use the reloaded Rossiter-McLaughlin technique to directly probe
its starspot properties. Unfortunately, we find no evidence for starspot
occultations in the datasets herein. Additionally, we searched for stellar
surface differential rotation (DR) and any centre-to-limb variation (CLV) due
to convection, but return a null detection of both. This is unsurprising for
WASP-52, given its relatively cool temperature, high magnetic activity (which
leads to lower CLV), and projected obliquity near 0 degrees (meaning the
transit chord is less likely to cross several stellar latitudes). For HAT-P-30,
this result was more surprising given its hotter effective temperature, lower
magnetic field, and high projected obliquity (near 70 degrees). To explore the
reasons behind the null DR and CLV detection for HAT-P-30, we simulated a
variety of scenarios. We find that either the CLV present on HAT-P-30 is below
the solar level or the presence of DR prevents a CLV detection given the
precision of the data herein. A careful treatment of both DR and CLV is
required, especially for systems with high impact factors, due to potential
degeneracies between the two. Future observations and/or a sophisticated
treatment of the red noise present in the data (likely due to granulation) is
required to refine the DR and CLV for these particular systems; such
observations would also present another opportunity to try to examine starspots
on WASP-52.

agreed-upon and non-repudiable timeline of events. The unique properties of
blockchain facilitate this by providing immutability and availability. For
power asymmetric environments such as the workplace, permissionless blockchain
is especially beneficial as no trusted third party is required. Yet, two issues
remain: (1) In a decentralized environment, no arbiter can facilitate and
attest to data exchanges. Simple peer-to-peer sharing of data, conversely,
lacks the required non-repudiation. (2) With data governed by privacy
legislation such as the GDPR, the core advantage of immutability becomes a
liability. After a rightful request, an individual's personal data need to be
rectified or deleted, which is impossible in an immutable blockchain.
  To solve these issues, we present Kovacs, a decentralized data exchange and
usage logging system for inverse transparency built on blockchain. Its
new-usage protocol ensures non-repudiation, and therefore accountability, for
inverse transparency. Its one-time pseudonym generation algorithm guarantees
unlinkability and enables proof of ownership, which allows data subjects to
exercise their legal rights regarding their personal data. With our

In gravity and

symmetry. However, once the theory contains a scalar field, conformal
transformations of the metric can be considered a subclass of a more general
type of transformation, so-called disformal transformation. Here, we
investigate the implications of pure disformal symmetry in the Universe. We
derive the form of general disformal invariant tensors from which we build the
most general disformal invariant action. We argue that, in cosmology, disformal
symmetry amounts to require that the lapse function is fully replaced by a
(time-like) scalar field at the level of the action. We then show that
disformal symmetry is in general an exactly equivalent formulation of general
mimetic gravity. Lastly, we go beyond mimetic gravity and find that a
particular class of invariance leads to seemingly Ostrogradski-like (with
higher derivatives) Lagrangians, which are nevertheless absent of Ostrogradski
ghosts in a cosmological background, despite having an additional degree of
freedom. We also propose an application of our formalism to find new invertible
disformal transformations, where the coefficient involves higher derivatives

influenza or SARS-CoV-2. While high mutation rates promote antigenic escape,
they also induce large mutational loads and reduced fitness. It remains unclear
how this cost-benefit trade-off selects the mutation rate of viruses. Using a
traveling wave model for the co-evolution of viruses and host immune systems in
a finite population, we investigate how immunity affects the evolution of the
mutation rate and other non-antigenic traits, such as virulence. We first show
that the nature of the wave depends on how cross-reactive immune systems are,
reconciling previous approaches. The immune-virus system behaves like a Fisher
wave at low cross-reactivities, and like a fitness wave at high
cross-reactivities. These regimes predict different outcomes for the evolution
of non-antigenic traits. At low cross-reactivities, the evolutionarily stable
strategy is to maximize the speed of the wave, implying a higher mutation rate
and increased virulence. At large cross-reactivities, where our estimates place
H3N2 influenza, the stable strategy is to increase the basic reproductive
number, keeping the mutation rate to a minimum and virulence low.

extending the life of the companion star, which in turn can enhance early

highly effective tool for modeling electronic structures of systems ranging
from room-temperature materials to warm dense matter. Its accuracy critically
depends on the employed kinetic energy (KE) density functional, which has to be
supplied as an external input. In this work, we use an external harmonic
perturbation in OF-DFT to compute the density response function. This allows us
to test whether exact conditions in the limit of uniform densities (i.e. for
the uniform electron gas, or UEG) are satisfied. We demonstrate the utility of
this direct perturbation approach by considering different non-local and
Laplacian-level KE functionals. The results illustrate that several functionals
violate exact conditions in the UEG limit. Additionally, we also test KE
functional approximations beyond the linear density response regime by
gradually increasing the density perturbation amplitude and comparing against
Kohn-Sham DFT results which employ the exact non-interacting KE functional. The
results show a strong correlation between the accuracy of the KE functionals in
the UEG limit and in the strongly inhomogeneous case. This empirically
demonstrates the importance of the UEG limit based constraint for the
construction of accurate KE functionals. This conclusion is substantiated by
additional calculations for bulk Aluminum (Al) with a face-centered cubic
lattice with and without an external harmonic perturbation. The analysis of the
Al data follows closely the conclusions drawn for the UEG, allowing us to
extend our conclusions to realistic systems that experience density
inhomogeneities induced by ions. Analyzing other classes of KE functionals
(e.g., based on the quadratic UEG density response function and the
jellium-with-gap model) and other types of systems, such as semiconductors, is

granular-ball computing is more efficient; the coarse-grained characteristics
of granular-balls are less likely to be affected by fine-grained sample points,

propose DPAF, an effective differentially private generative model for
high-dimensional image synthesis. Different from the prior private stochastic
gradient descent-based methods that add Gaussian noises in the backward phase
during the model training, DPAF adds a differentially private feature
aggregation in the forward phase, bringing advantages, including the reduction
of information loss in gradient clipping and low sensitivity for the
aggregation. Moreover, as an improper batch size has an adverse impact on the
utility of synthetic data, DPAF also tackles the problem of setting a proper
batch size by proposing a novel training strategy that asymmetrically trains
different parts of the discriminator. We extensively evaluate different methods
on multiple image datasets (up to images of 128x128 resolution) to demonstrate
the performance of DPAF.

Traditionally, HPL parameters are optimised in an automated fashion relying on
black-box numerical methods. However, these can be demanding in terms of
computational resources and usually disregard transient and complex dynamics.
Model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative
framework for optimising HPL performance since it allows to tune the control
parameters as a function of system states subject to nonlinear temporal
dynamics without requiring an explicit dynamics model of those. Furthermore,
DRL aims to find an optimal control policy rather than a static parameter
configuration, particularly suitable for dynamic processes involving sequential
decision-making. This is particularly relevant as laser systems are typically
characterised by dynamic rather than static traits. Hence the need for a
strategy to choose the control applied based on the current context instead of
one single optimal control configuration. This paper investigates the potential
of DRL in improving the efficiency and safety of HPL control systems. We apply
this technique to optimise the temporal profile of laser pulses in the L1 pump
laser hosted at the ELI Beamlines facility. We show how to adapt DRL to the

which are particularly challenging because of the frequent inclusion of PHI

comparisons. This methodology de-identifies the images, reduces file sizes, and
prepares image volumes for applications in deep learning and data sharing. To
evaluate its effectiveness in processing ultrasound data, a random sample of 50
cardiac ultrasounds (echocardiograms) were processed through PyLogik, and the
outputs were compared with the manual segmentations by an expert user. The Dice
coefficient of the two approaches achieved an average value of 0.976. Next, an
investigation was conducted to ascertain the degree of information compression
achieved using the algorithm. Resultant data was found to be on average ~72%

Fokker-Planck equations, which we call MSBTM. We establish an upper bound on
the time derivative of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to MSBTM numerical
estimation from the exact solution, thus validates the MSBTM approach. Besides,
we provide an error analysis for the algorithm. In numerical experiments, we
study two types of mean-field Fokker-Planck equation and their corresponding
dynamics of particles in interacting systems. The MSBTM algorithm is
numerically validated through qualitative and quantitative comparison between
the MSBTM solutions, the results of integrating the associated stochastic
differential equation and the analytical solutions if available.

learning models, financial time series forecasting models have advanced
significantly, and these developments are often difficult to keep up with.
Hence, we have conducted this literature review to provide a comprehensive
assessment of recent research from 2020 to 2022 on deep learning models used to
predict prices based on financial time series. Our review presents different
data sources and neural network structures, as well as their implementation
details. Our goals are to ensure that interested researchers remain up-to-date
on recent developments in the field and facilitate the selection of baselines
based on models used in prior studies. Additionally, we provide suggestions for
future research based on the content in this review.

complex bio-molecules and an understanding of the prebiotic chemistry in the
interstellar medium (ISM). We presented the first detection of the rotational
emission lines of the amide-like molecule cyanamide (NH$_{2}$CN) towards the
hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 using the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). Using the rotational diagram model, the
derived column density of NH$_{2}$CN towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 was
(5.9$\pm$2.5)$\times$10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ with a rotational temperature of
100.6$\pm$30.4 K. The derived fractional abundance of NH$_{2}$CN towards the
G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 with respect to H$_{2}$ was
(4.72$\pm$2.0)$\times$10$^{-10}$, which is very similar to the existent
three-phase warm-up chemical model abundances of NH$_{2}$CN. We compare the
estimated abundance of NH$_{2}$CN towards G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 with other
sources, and we observe the abundance of NH$_{2}$CN towards G358.93$-$0.03 MM1
is nearly similar to that of the sculptor galaxy NGC 253 and the low-mass
protostars IRAS 16293-2422 B and NGC 1333 IRAS4A2. We also discussed the
possible formation mechanisms of NH$_{2}$CN towards the hot molecular cores and
hot corinos, and we find that the NH$_{2}$CN molecule was created in the
grain-surfaces of G358.93-0.03 MM1 via the neutral-neutral reaction between
NH$_{2}$ and CN.

the angular size of the Sun to Thales of Miletus, in the 6th Century BC.
Cleomedes, also in the 2nd Century AD, described a method to perform the
measurement, based on timing the duration of the sunrise. Several modern
authors have suggested Thales used Cleomedes' method, but others are skeptical
of the connection. Here I present an objection that has not been discussed in
the literature, namely, that the proportionality between the size of the Sun
and the duration of sunrise is not constant, but changes with latitude and time
of the year, due to what I call the ``asymmetric sunrise effect''. I show that
this effect is large enough to have prevented Thales from obtaining the roughly
accurate recorded value.

  Detection over Multivariate Time-Series Data","13 pages",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A Distributed Denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to
disrupt the regular traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by
sending a flood of traffic to overwhelm the target or its surrounding
infrastructure. As technology improves, new attacks have been developed by
hackers. Traditional statistical and shallow machine learning techniques can
detect superficial anomalies based on shallow data and feature selection,
however, these approaches cannot detect unseen DDoS attacks. In this context,
we propose a reconstruction-based anomaly detection model named
LSTM-Autoencoder (LSTM-AE) which combines two deep learning-based models for
detecting DDoS attack anomalies. The proposed structure of long short-term
memory (LSTM) networks provides units that work with each other to learn the
long short-term correlation of data within a time series sequence. Autoencoders
are used to identify the optimal threshold based on the reconstruction error
rates evaluated on each sample across all time-series sequences. As such, a
combination model LSTM-AE can not only learn delicate sub-pattern differences
in attacks and benign traffic flows, but also minimize reconstructed benign
traffic to obtain a lower range reconstruction error, with attacks presenting a
larger reconstruction error. In this research, we trained and evaluated our
proposed LSTM-AE model on reflection-based DDoS attacks (DNS, LDAP, and SNMP).
The results of our experiments demonstrate that our method performs better than
other state-of-the-art methods, especially for LDAP attacks, with an accuracy
of over 99.

  Antibody Designer",,,,,"q-bio.BM cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Antibodies are crucial proteins produced by the immune system in response to
foreign substances or antigens. The specificity of an antibody is determined by
its complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which are located in the
variable domains of the antibody chains and form the antigen-binding site.
Previous studies have utilized complex techniques to generate CDRs, but they
suffer from inadequate geometric modeling. Moreover, the common iterative
refinement strategies lead to an inefficient inference. In this paper, we
propose a \textit{simple yet effective} model that can co-design 1D sequences
and 3D structures of CDRs in a one-shot manner. To achieve this, we decouple
the antibody CDR design problem into two stages: (i) geometric modeling of
protein complex structures and (ii) sequence-structure co-learning. We develop
a novel macromolecular structure invariant embedding, typically for protein
complexes, that captures both intra- and inter-component interactions among the
backbone atoms, including C$\alpha$, N, C, and O atoms, to achieve
comprehensive geometric modeling. Then, we introduce a simple cross-gate MLP
for sequence-structure co-learning, allowing sequence and structure
representations to implicitly refine each other. This enables our model to
design desired sequences and structures in a one-shot manner. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate our results at both the sequence and
structure level, which demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art antibody CDR design methods.

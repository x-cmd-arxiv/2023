distances is an essential task of the necessary transition to a CO$_2$-free
energy economy. An oxidation-reduction cycle based on iron and its oxides
represents a very promising technology in this regard. The present work
assesses the potential of converting an existing modern coal-fired power plant
to operation with iron. For this purpose, a systematic retrofit study is
carried out, employing a model that balances all material and energy fluxes in
a state-of-the-art coal-fired power plant. Particular attention is given to
components of the burner system and the system$'$s heat exchanger. The analysis
provides evidence that main components such as the steam generator and steam
cycle can be reused with moderate modifications. Major modifications are
related to the larger amounts of solids produced during iron combustion, for
instance in the particle feeding and removal systems. Since the high particle
densities and lower demand for auxiliary systems improve the heat transfer, the
net efficiencies of iron operation can be one to two percentage points better
than coal operation, depending on operating conditions. This new insight can
significantly accelerate the introduction of this innovative technology by
guiding future research and the development of the retrofit option.

superconductivity in the Hubbard models by simply changing the sign of the
hopping amplitudes of the spin-down electrons, and apply it to three prototype
two-dimensional lattices (honeycomb, square, and triangular). The parent
Hamiltonian at half filling has long-range magnetic order, which is
ferromagnetic in all three directions for the frustrated triangular lattices,

critical interactions on honeycomb and triangular lattices, which are estimated
by finite-size scalings. When the systems are doped, we find the triplet p-wave

hard-core-like models for particle uptake. Introducing an exactly solvable
equilibrium model in one dimension, we demonstrate that the formation of
carrier-cargo complexes can be largely tuned by both the cargo concentration

interpreting the internal free space (partition function) of the cargo inside a

Such a mapping can be generally applied to account for attractive interactions,
multiple cargo uptake and various carrier or cargo species. Within this

between counterpropagating Alfv\'enic fluctuations, which interact nonlinearly
to generate the turbulence, has been quantified by the cross helicity and
Elsasser ratio. Velocity shears at a 30-min timescale were identified, with the
shear amplitude defined in terms of the linear Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)
instability threshold. The shears were associated with 74 interplanetary
coronal mass ejection (ICME) sheaths observed by the Wind spacecraft at 1 au
between 1997 and 2018. Typically weaker shears upstream of the sheaths and
downstream in the ICME ejecta were also analyzed. In shears below the KH
threshold, imbalance was approximately invariant or weakly rising with shear
amplitude. Above the KH threshold, fluctuations tended toward a balanced state
with increasing shear amplitude. Magnetic compressibility was also found to
increase above the KH threshold. These findings are consistent with velocity
shears being local sources of sunward fluctuations that act to reduce net
imbalances in the antisunward direction, and suggest that the KH instability
plays a role in this process.

this approach does not assume the matching condition of the disturbances.
Besides, compared to the conventional disturbance estimation methods, the

the concerns of heavy computational load and amplified noise for practical
problems like external torque estimation of high degree-of-freedom manipulators

linearized model for the Euler-Lagrangian system and designing a
sliding-mode-based disturbance observer. The estimation precision of the

of formation, highlighting the interplay between the star formation rate and
the efficiency of forming merging binary black holes from binary stars, both of
which strongly depend on metallicity. We find that across models, over 50% of
BBH mergers have a progenitor metallicity of a few tenths of Solar metallicity,
however, inferring formation galaxy properties strongly depends on both the
binary evolution model and global metallicity evolution. The numerous, low-mass
black holes ($\mathrm{\lesssim 15\,M_{\odot}}$) trace the bulk of the star
formation in galaxies heavier than the Milky way ($M_\mathrm{Gal}$
$\mathrm{\gtrsim 10^{10.5}\,M_{\odot}}$). In contrast, heavier BBH mergers
typically stem from larger black holes forming in lower metallicity dwarf
galaxies ($M_\mathrm{Gal}$ $\mathrm{\lesssim 10^{9}\,M_{\odot}}$). We find that
the progenitors of detectable binary black holes tend to arise from dwarf
galaxies at a lower formation redshift ($\lesssim \, 1$). We also produce a
posterior probability of the progenitor environment for any detected

primary goal of describing its geometric shape and properties. We achieve so by
introducing various structural parameters of the service rate region and
establishing upper and lower bounds for them. The techniques we apply in this
paper range from coding theory to optimization. One of our main results shows
that every rational point of the service rate region has a so-called rational
allocation, answering an open question in the research area.

such as vision, sound, and touch. While vision can provide information about an
object's appearance, non-visual sensors, such as audio and haptics, can provide
information about its intrinsic properties, such as weight, temperature,
hardness, and the object's sound. Using tools to interact with objects can
reveal additional object properties that are otherwise hidden (e.g., knives and
spoons can be used to examine the properties of food, including its texture and
consistency). Robots can use tools to interact with objects and gather
information about their implicit properties via non-visual sensors. However, a
robot's model for recognizing objects using a tool-mediated behavior does not
generalize to a new tool or behavior due to differing observed data
distributions. To address this challenge, we propose a framework to enable
robots to transfer implicit knowledge about granular objects across different
tools and behaviors. The proposed approach learns a shared latent space from
multiple robots' contexts produced by respective sensory data while interacting
with objects using tools. We collected a dataset using a UR5 robot that
performed 5,400 interactions using 6 tools and 6 behaviors on 15 granular
objects and tested our method on cross-tool and cross-behavioral transfer

(EBSD) measurement and crystal plasticity modeling were carried out to
investigate the tensile twinning behaviors in a Mg alloy. The results showed
that tensile twinning activity was underestimated using conventional 2D EBSD
scans. When compressed to yield point, the examined twin frequency with 2D was
lower than that using 3D EBSD. The effects of Schmid factor (SF) on twinning
were investigated. Almost all high Schmid factor (SF>0.35) grains were twinned.
A surprising high twin frequency of 82% in middle SF (0.35>=SF>=0.15) grains
was observed, which was unexpected since the middle SF grains were believed to
be unfavorable for twinning. The twin frequency in low SF (SF<0.15) grains was
slightly increased from 2D to 3D EBSD due to the small volume of twins. The
shear stress maintained a high level and was homogeneously distributed in high
SF grains, facilitating twin nucleation and growth. The shear stress was
distributed heterogeneously within the middle SF grains, and twins were
nucleated within areas with positive shear stress. The shear stress in low SF
grains was not favorable for twinning and twins occurred in the vicinity of
stress accumulation. Twinning activities in the same grain varied on different
layers. It was attributed to the stress fluctuation derived from grain
environment changes.

in the emergence of higher-order topological phases. In this connection, the
existing work in time-reversal symmetric systems has focused on gapping Dirac
cones below the Fermi level or the Dirac cones with particle-hole symmetry,
which is unsuitable for the edge solitons in the common spin-Chern insulators.
Here, we discuss the mass-kink mechanism in systems where
time-reversal-symmetric perturbations open gaps in the time-reversal-related
Dirac cones. We thus explain the appearance of pairwise corner modes and
predict the emergence of extra charges around the corners. By following the
phase evolution of the corner modes along the edge of a nanodisk, we
demonstrate that the in-gap corner modes and the extra charges around the
corner can be generated through the mass-kink mechanism driven by the Sz-mixing
spin-orbit coupling. We thus provide strong evidence that a spin-Chern
insulator with spin-Chern number Cs=2 is a higher-order topological insulator
with protected corner charges.

autonomous robots interacting in unstructured environments for applications
such as object pose estimation, simultaneous localization and mapping,
robot-sensor calibration, and so on. In global correspondence-based point cloud
registration, data association is a highly brittle task and commonly produces
high amounts of outliers. Failure to reject outliers can lead to errors
propagating to downstream perception tasks. Maximum Consensus (MC) is a widely
used technique for robust estimation, which is however known to be NP-hard.
Exact methods struggle to scale to realistic problem instances, whereas high
outlier rates are challenging for approximate methods. To this end, we propose
Graph-based Maximum Consensus Registration (GMCR), which is highly robust to
outliers and scales to realistic problem instances. We propose novel consensus
functions to map the decoupled MC-objective to the graph domain, wherein we
find a tight approximation to the maximum consensus set as the maximum clique.
The final pose estimate is given in closed-form. We extensively evaluated our
proposed GMCR on a synthetic registration benchmark, robotic object
localization task, and additionally on a scan matching benchmark. Our proposed
method shows high accuracy and time efficiency compared to other
state-of-the-art MC methods and compares favorably to other robust registration

uncertainty that inevitably exists in travel demand prediction. To fill this
gap, this study proposes a framework of probabilistic graph neural networks
(Prob-GNN) to quantify the spatiotemporal uncertainty of travel demand. This
Prob-GNN framework is substantiated by deterministic and probabilistic
assumptions, and empirically applied to the task of predicting the transit and
ridesharing demand in Chicago. We found that the probabilistic assumptions
(e.g. distribution tail, support) have a greater impact on uncertainty
prediction than the deterministic ones (e.g. deep modules, depth). Among the
family of Prob-GNNs, the GNNs with truncated Gaussian and Laplace distributions
achieve the highest performance in transit and ridesharing data. Even under
significant domain shifts, Prob-GNNs can predict the ridership uncertainty in a
stable manner, when the models are trained on pre-COVID data and tested across
multiple periods during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Prob-GNNs also reveal
the spatiotemporal pattern of uncertainty, which is concentrated on the
afternoon peak hours and the areas with large travel volumes. Overall, our
findings highlight the importance of incorporating randomness into deep
learning for spatiotemporal ridership prediction. Future research should
continue to investigate versatile probabilistic assumptions to capture
behavioral randomness, and further develop methods to quantify uncertainty to

90,000 targets using Kurucz models and, when available, IUE spectra. CUBS also
includes robust checks for agreement between the Kurucz models and the IUE

we regard ChatGPT as a human evaluator and give task-specific (e.g.,

ensure a global field structure close to the force-free one, while the
dissipation occurs mainly in and around the equatorial current sheet. The
particles injected in the separatrix zone affect the particle populations that
enter the equatorial current sheet region and, therefore, the corresponding
accelerating electric fields, particle energies, the spectral cutoff energy,
and gamma-ray efficiency. The separatrix zone models reproduce the recently
discovered fundamental plane of gamma-ray pulsars consistent with curvature
radiation emission, the gamma-ray light-curve shapes, and the radio-lag vs.

interacting with the magnetospheres of nascent millisecond magnetars and

the fallback disc is very high, well above the rate required for the Eddington
limit to match the observed luminosity, even if there is strong beaming. The
inner parts of such a disc, even if it is cooling by the neutrino emission, get
spherical due to the radiation pressure, which regulates the mass accretion
rate within the spherization radius. Such a disc can not penetrate the light
cylinder radius for the typical magnetic fields, and the initial spin
frequencies invoked for the magnetars. As a result of the auto-regulation of
the accretion flow, the fallback disc can not interact directly with the
neutron star's magnetosphere within the first few days the GRB afterglows are
observed. When the interaction of the disc with the magnetosphere starts, the
system's luminosity is too low to address the X-ray afterglows. We conclude
that a fallback disc model, which must include the effects of the radiation

conditions, other approximations are used. A common approximation is the
1-exciton model in which processes involving weak excitations are described
using a basis comprising of the ground state and singly excited states of the
molecule cavity-mode system. In another frequently used approximation in
numerical investigations, the electromagnetic field is described classically,
and the quantum molecular subsystem is treated in the mean-field Hartree
approximation with its wavefunction assumed to be a product of single
molecules' wavefunctions. The former disregards states that take long time to
populate, and is therefore essentially a short time approximation. The latter
is not limited in this way, but by its nature, disregards some intermolecular
and molecule-field correlations. In this work, we directly compare results

elucidated before. Herein, using the first-principles calculations and
Boltzmann transport theory, we reveal that the electron-phonon coupling can be
significant and thus greatly inhibits the electron and phonon transport in
electron-doped BP3 and CP3. The intrinsic heat transport capacity of flexural
acoustic phonon modes in the wrinkle structure is largely suppressed arising
from the strong out-of-plane phonon scatterings, leading to the low phonon
thermal conductivity of 1.36 and 5.33 W/(mK) for BP3 and CP3 at room
temperature, and at high doping level, the enhanced scattering from electron
diminishes the phonon thermal conductivity by 71% and 54% for BP3 and CP3,
respectively. Instead, electron thermal conductivity shows nonmonotonic
variations with the increase of doping concentration, stemming from the
competition between electron-phonon scattering rates and electron group
velocity. It is worth noting that the heavy-doping effect induced strong
scattering from phonon largely suppresses the electron transport and reduces
electron thermal conductivity to the magnitude of phonon thermal conductivity.
This work sheds light on the electron and phonon transport properties in
semimetal triphosphides monolayer and provides an efficient avenue for the

significant milestones have been achieved along the path of pursuing universal
fault-tolerant quantum computers. Quantum advantage, the tipping point
heralding the quantum era, has been accomplished along with several waves of
breakthroughs. Quantum hardware has become more integrated and architectural
compared to its toddler days. The controlling precision of various physical
systems is pushed beyond the fault-tolerant threshold. Meanwhile, quantum
computation research has established a new norm by embracing industrialization
and commercialization. The joint power of governments, private investors, and
tech companies has significantly shaped a new vibrant environment that
accelerates the development of this field, now at the beginning of the noisy
intermediate-scale quantum era. Here, we first discuss the progress achieved in
the field of quantum computation by reviewing the most important algorithms and
advances in the most promising technical routes, and then summarizing the
next-stage challenges. Furthermore, we illustrate our confidence that solid
foundations have been built for the fault-tolerant quantum computer and our
optimism that the emergence of quantum killer applications essential for human
society shall happen in the future.

  monostable excitable dynamics",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Paleoclimate proxy records evidence repeated abrupt climatic transitions
during past glacial intervals with strongest expression in the North Atlantic
region. These so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events are followed by phases
of relatively mild temperatures termed interstadials, which exhibit gradual
cooling over several hundred to a few thousand years prior to a final phase of
abrupt temperature decrease back to cold stadials. To date, there is no
consensus on the mechanism of this millennial-scale variability. Here, we
propose an excitable model system to explain the DO cycles, in which
interstadials occur as noise-induced state space excursions. Our model
comprises the mutual multi-scale interactions between four dynamical variables
representing Arctic atmospheric temperatures, Nordic Seas' temperatures and sea
ice cover, and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Crucially, the
model's atmosphere--ocean heat flux is moderated by the sea ice variable, which
in turn is subject to large perturbations dynamically generated by fast
evolving intermittent noise. If supercritical, these perturbations trigger
interstadial-like state space excursions seizing all four model variables. As a
physical source for such a driving noise process we propose convective events
in the ocean or atmospheric blocking events. The key characteristics of DO
cycles are reproduced by our model with remarkable resemblance to the proxy
record; in particular, their shape, return time, as well as the dependence of
the interstadial and stadial durations on the background conditions are
reproduced accurately. In contrast to the prevailing understanding that the DO
variability showcases bistability in the underlying dynamics, we conclude that
multi-scale, monostable excitable dynamics provides a promising alternative
candidate to explain the millennial-scale climate variability associated with
the DO events.

compact nuclear star cluster that contains a sub-parsec concentration of
fast-moving young stars called S-stars. Their location and age are not easily
explained by current star formation models, and in several scenarios the
presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) has been invoked. We use
GRAVITY astrometric and SINFONI, KECK, and GNIRS spectroscopic data of S2 to
investigate whether a second massive object could be present deep in the
Galactic Centre (GC) in the form of an IMBH binary companion to SgrA*. To solve
the three-body problem, we used a post-Newtonian framework and consider two
types of settings: (i) a hierarchical set-up where the star S2 orbits the SgrA*
- IMBH binary and (ii) a non-hierarchical set-up where the IMBH trajectory lies
outside the S2 orbit. In both cases we explore the full 20-dimensional
parameter space by employing a Bayesian dynamic nested sampling method. For the
hierarchical case we find: IMBH masses > 2000 Msun on orbits with smaller
semi-major axes than S2 are largely excluded. For the non-hierarchical case the
parameter space contains several pockets of valid IMBH solutions. However, a
closer analysis of their impact on the resident stars reveals that IMBHs on
semi-major axes larger than S2 tend to disrupt the S-star cluster in less than
a million years. This makes the existence of an IMBH among the S-stars highly
unlikely. The current S2 data do not formally require the presence of an IMBH.
If an IMBH hides in the GC, it has to be either a low-mass IMBH inside the S2
orbit that moves on a short and significantly inclined trajectory or an IMBH
with a semi-major axis >1"". We provide the parameter maps of valid IMBH
solutions in the GC and discuss the general structure of our results.

the distribution of neutral mutations in a cell population under therapeutic
pressure. The cell population is modeled by a bi-type branching process.
Initially, the cells all carry type 0, associated with a negative growth rate.
Mutations towards type $1$ are assumed to be rare and random, and lead to the
survival of cells under treatment, i.e. type $1$ is associated with a positive
growth rate, and thus models the acquisition of a resistance. Cells also carry
neutral mutations, acquired at birth and accumulated by inheritance, that do
not affect their type. We describe the expectation of the ""Site Frequency

of large initial population. Precisely, we give asymptotically-equivalent

the agent to an irrecoverable path. To tackle this problem, we propose
Meta-Explore, a hierarchical navigation method deploying an exploitation policy

connects two limits: one where the functional is known in terms of the

This paper devotes to 1) detecting unanticipated behavior regularities by
conducting a series of laboratory experiments, and 2) improving existing DTD
dynamics theories by embedding the observed behavior regularities into a route
choice model. First, 312 subjects participated in one of the eight
decision-making scenarios and make route choices repeatedly in congestible
parallel-route networks. Second, three route-switching behavior patterns that
cannot be fully explained by the classic route-choice models are observed.
Third, to enrich the explanation power of a discrete route-choice model,
behavioral assumptions of route-dependent attractions, i.e., route-dependent
inertia and preference, are introduced. An analytical DTD dynamic model is
accordingly proposed and proven to steadily converge to a unique equilibrium
state. Finally, the proposed DTD model could satisfactorily reproduce the
observations in various datasets. The research results can help transportation
science theorists to make the best use of laboratory experimentation and to
build network equilibrium or DTD dynamic models with both real behavioral basis

vary widely depending on the type of country, data coverage, and frequency.
However, the ERPT estimation using firm-level high-frequency export data of a
small developing country is rare. In this paper, I estimate the pricing to
market and the exchange rate pass-through at a monthly, quarterly, and annual
level of data frequency to deal with aggregation bias. Furthermore, I
investigate how delivery time-based factors such as frequent shipments and
faster transport affect a firm`s pricing-to-market behavior. Using
transaction-level export data of Bangladesh from 2005 to 2013 and the Poisson
Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimation method, I find very small pricing
to the markets to the exchange rates in the exporter's price. As pass-through
shows how the exporters respond to macro shocks, for Bangladesh, this low
export price response to the exchange rate changes indicates that currency
devaluation might not have a significant effect on the exporter. The minimal
price response and high pass-through contrast with the literature on incomplete
pass-through at the annual level. By considering the characteristics of the
firms, products, and destinations, I investigate the heterogeneity of the
pass-through. The findings remain consistent with several robustness checks.

are likely to get before actually obtaining those answers. This can potentially
be achieved by designing systems to offer the estimates of a data operation
result -- say op(data) -- earlier in the process based on partial data
processing. Those estimates continuously refine as more data is processed and
finally converge to the exact answer. Unfortunately, the existing techniques --
called Online Aggregation (OLA) -- are limited to a single operation; that is,
we cannot obtain the estimates for op(op(data)) or op(...(op(data))). If this
Deep OLA becomes possible, data analysts will be able to explore data more
interactively using complex cascade operations.
  In this work, we take a step toward Deep OLA with evolving data frames (edf),
a novel data model to offer OLA for nested ops -- op(...(op(data))) -- by
representing an evolving structured data (with converging estimates) that is
closed under set operations. That is, op(edf) produces yet another edf; thus,
we can freely apply successive operations to edf and obtain an OLA output for
each op. We evaluate its viability with Wake, an edf-based OLA system, by
examining against state-of-the-art OLA and non-OLA systems. In our experiments
on TPC-H dataset, Wake produces its first estimates 4.93x faster (median) --
with 1.3x median slowdown for exact answers -- compared to conventional
systems. Besides its generality, Wake is also 1.92x faster (median) than
existing OLA systems in producing estimates of under 1% relative errors.

is often observed simultaneously with the CO J = 1 - 0 line. In a sample of 9
nearby galaxies ranging from ultra-luminous infrared galaxies to normal spiral
galaxies, we measure a remarkably constant CN/HCN line intensity ratio of 0.86
$\pm$ 0.07 (standard deviation of 0.20). This relatively constant CN/HCN line
ratio is rather unexpected, as models of photon dominated regions have
suggested that HCN emission traces shielded regions with high column densities
while CN should trace dense gas exposed to high ultraviolet radiation fields.
We find that the CN/HCN line ratio shows no significant correlation with
molecular gas surface density, but shows a mild trend (increase of ~ 1.3 per
dex) with both star formation rate surface density and star formation
efficiency (the inverse of the molecular gas depletion time). Some starburst
and active galactic nuclei show small enhancements in their CN/HCN ratio, while
other nuclei show no significant difference from their surrounding disks. The
nearly constant CN/HCN line ratio implies that CN, like HCN, can be used as a
tracer of dense gas mass and dense gas fraction in nearby galaxies.

Specifically, we design and fabricate an elastic medium decorated with arrays
of pillar-type resonators whose eigenmodes are locate below the sound cone,
together with coupling bridges edged according to a specific algorithm. We
establish a connection between the collective dynamics of the pillars and that
of electrons in a magnetic field by deriving an accurate tight-binding model

with spatially slow-varying couplings. This enable us to predict topological
pumping pattern, which is numerically and experimentally demonstrated by
steering waves from one edge of the system to the other. Finally, the immune
character of the topologically pumped surface waves against disorder and

shift in a multimode circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) system in the
deep-strong coupling (DSC) regime, where the qubit-resonator coupling strength
is comparable to or larger than the qubit and resonator frequencies. The system
comprises a superconducting flux qubit (FQ) and a quarter-wavelength coplanar
waveguide resonator ($\lambda/4$ CPWR) that are coupled inductively through a
shared edge that contains a Josephson junction to achieve the DSC regime.
Spectroscopy is performed around the frequency of the fundamental mode of the
CPWR, and the spectrum is fitted by the single-mode quantum Rabi Hamiltonian to
obtain the system parameters. Since the qubit is also coupled to a large number
of higher modes in the resonator, the single-mode fitting does not provide the
bare qubit energy but a value that incorporates the renormalization from all
the other modes. We derive theoretical formulas for the Lamb shift in the
multimode resonator system. As shown in previous studies, there is a cut-off
frequency $\omega_{\textrm{cutoff}}$ for the coupling between the FQ and the
modes in the CPWR, where the coupling grows as $\sqrt{\omega_n}$ for
$\omega_n/\omega_{\textrm{cutoff}}\ll 1$ and decreases as $1/\sqrt{\omega_n}$
for $\omega_n/\omega_{\textrm{cutoff}}\gg 1$. Here $\omega_n$ is the frequency
of the $n$th mode. Using our observed spectrum and theoretical formulas, we
estimate that the Lamb shift from the fundamental mode is 82.3\% and the total
Lamb shift from all the modes is 96.5\%. This result illustrates that the
coupling to the large number of modes in a CPWR yields an extremely large Lamb
shift but does not suppress the qubit energy to zero, which would happen in the
absence of a high-frequency cut-off.

trained by a large number of users, using their private data in their local
devices. With top $r$ sparsification in FL, the users only upload the most
significant $r$ fraction of updates, and the servers only send the most
significant $r'$ fraction of parameters to the users in order to reduce the
communication cost. However, the values and the indices of the sparse updates
leak information about the users' private data. In this work, we consider an FL
setting where $N$ non-colluding databases store the model to be trained, from
which the users download and update sparse parameters privately, without
revealing the values of the updates or their indices to the databases. We
propose four schemes with different properties to perform this task while
achieving the minimum communication costs, and show that the information
theoretic privacy of both values and positions of the sparse updates can be
guaranteed. This is achieved at a considerable storage cost, though. To
alleviate this, we generalize the schemes in such a way that the storage cost
is reduced at the expense of a certain amount of information leakage, using a
model segmentation mechanism. In general, we provide the tradeoff between
communication cost, storage cost and information leakage in private FL with top
$r$ sparsification.

``Wigner kernels''. These are fully equivariant and body-ordered kernels that
can be computed iteratively with a cost that is independent of the
radial-chemical basis and grows only linearly with the maximum body-order
considered. This is in marked contrast to feature-space models, which comprise
an exponentially-growing number of terms with increasing order of correlations.
We present several examples of the accuracy of models based on Wigner kernels
in chemical applications, for both scalar and tensorial targets, reaching
state-of-the-art accuracy on the popular QM9 benchmark dataset, and we discuss
the broader relevance of these ideas to equivariant geometric machine-learning.

sets the rate of free neutron decay after the weak interactions freeze out. We
review the history of the interplay between $\tau_n$ measurements and BBN, and
present a study of the sensitivity of the light element abundances to the

dominate the predicted $^4{\rm He}$ error budget, but these theory errors
remain smaller than the uncertainties in $^4{\rm He}$ observations, even with
the dispersion in recent neutron lifetime measurements. For the other
light-element predictions, $\tau_n$ contributes negligibly to their error

core-collapse supernova explosions that created them. In contrast, black holes
are not yet clearly associated with supernova remnants. Indeed, some
observations suggest that black holes are ``born in the dark'', i.e. without a
supernova explosion. Herein, we present a multi-wavelength analysis of the
X-ray transient Swift J1728.9$-$3613, based on observations made with Chandra,
ESO-VISTA, MeerKAT, NICER, NuSTAR, Swift, and XMM-Newton. Three independent
diagnostics indicate that the system likely harbors a black hole primary.
Infrared imaging signals a massive companion star that is broadly consistent
with an A or B spectral type. Most importantly, the X-ray binary lies within
the central region of the catalogued supernova remnant G351.9$-$0.9. Our deep
MeerKAT image at 1.28~GHz signals that the remnant is in the Sedov phase; this
fact and the non-detection of the soft X-ray emission expected from such a
remnant argue that it lies at a distance that could coincide with the black
hole. Utilizing a formal measurement of the distance to Swift J1728.9$-$3613
($d = 8.4\pm 0.8$ kpc), a lower limit on the distance to G351.9$-$0.9 ($d \geq
7.5$ kpc), and the number and distribution of black holes and supernova
remnants within the Milky Way, extensive simulations suggest that the
probability of a chance superposition is $<1.7\%$ ($99.7\%$ credible interval).
The discovery of a black hole within a supernova remnant would support
numerical simulations that produce black holes and remnants, and thus provide
clear observational evidence of distinct black hole formation channels. We
discuss the robustness of our analysis and some challenges to this
interpretation.

As with non--equilibrium steady states in time--independent scenarios, the
current displays a Kramers' turnover including the formation of a plateau
region that captures the physical, continuum limit response. We demonstrate
that a simple stability criteria identifies an appropriate relaxation rate to
target this physical plateau. Using this approach, we study quantum transport
through a periodically--driven tilted lattice coupled to two metallic
reservoirs held at a finite bias and temperature. We use this model to
benchmark the extended reservoir approach and assess the stability criteria.
When the system and reservoir are weakly coupled, the approach recovers
well--understood physical behavior in this limit. Extended reservoirs enable
addressing strong coupling and non--linear response as well, where we analyze
how transport responds to the dynamics inside the driven lattice. These results
set the foundations for the use of extended reservoir approach for
periodically-driven, quantum systems, such as many--body Floquet states.

stellar masses in the range $10^{9.5}$ to $10^{12} M_{\odot}$. We present an
analysis of the internal structures and intrinsic properties of these galaxies
as a function of their environment. We measure their environment using three
proxies: central or satellite designation, halo mass and local $5^{th}$ nearest
neighbour galaxy density. We find that although these intrinsic properties
correlate most strongly with stellar mass, environment does play a secondary
role: at fixed stellar mass, galaxies in the densest regions are more radially
anisotropic. In addition, central galaxies, and galaxies in high local
densities show lower values of edge-on spin parameter proxy \lam. We also find
suggestions of a possible trend of the fractions of orbits with environment for
lower-mass galaxies (between $10^{9.5}$ and $10^{11} M_{\odot}$) such that, at
fixed stellar mass, galaxies in higher local densities and halo mass have
higher fractions of hot orbits and lower fractions of warm orbits. Our results

can extend our analysis to de Sitter vacua as well. However, the few known

clumps formed in 3D resistive MHD simulations of self-gravitating disks. The
magnetic field grows by means of the recently identified gravitational
instability dynamo (Riols & Latter 2018; Deng et al. 2020). Clumps are
identified and their evolution is tracked finely both backward and forward in
time. Their properties and evolutionary path is compared to clumps in companion
simulations without magnetic fields. We find that magnetic and rotational
energy are important in the clumps' outer regions, while in the cores, despite
appreciable magnetic field amplification, thermal pressure is most important in
counteracting gravity. Turbulent kinetic energy is of a smaller scale than
magnetic energy in the clumps. Compared to non-magnetized clumps, rotation is
less prominent, which results in lower angular momentum in much better
agreement with observations. In order to understand the very low sub-Jovian
masses of clumps forming in MHD simulations, we revisit the perturbation theory
of magnetized sheets finding support for a previously proposed magnetic
destabilization in low-shear regions. This can help explaining why
fragmentation ensues on a scale more than an order of magnitude smaller than
that of the Toomre mass. The smaller fragmentation scale and the high magnetic
pressure in clumps' envelopes explain why clumps in magnetized disks are
typically in the super-Earth to Neptune mass regime rather than Super-Jupiters
as in conventional disk instability. Our findings put forward a viable
alternative to core accretion to explain widespread formation of

J1728.9-3613 is an X-ray binary, likely associated with the supernova remnant
G351.9-0.9 (Balakrishnan et al. 2023). A NuSTAR X-ray spectrum of this source
during its 2019 outburst reveals reflection from an accretion disk extending to
the innermost stable circular orbit. Modeling of the relativistic Doppler
shifts and gravitational redshifts imprinted on the spectrum measures a
dimensionless spin parameter of $a=0.86\pm0.02$ ($1\sigma$ confidence), a small
inclination angle of the inner accretion disk $\theta<10$ degrees, and a
sub-solar iron abundance in the disk $A_{\rm Fe}<0.84$. This high spin value
rules out a neutron star primary at the $5\;\sigma$ level of confidence. If the
black hole is located in a still visible supernova remnant, it must be young.
Therefore, we place a lower limit on the natal black hole spin of $a>0.82$,
concluding that the black hole must have formed with a high spin. This
demonstrates that black hole formation channels that leave a supernova remnant,
and those that do not (e.g. Cyg X-1), can both lead to high natal spin with no
requirement for subsequent accretion within the binary system. Emerging
disparities between the population of high-spin black holes in X-ray binaries
and the low-spin black holes that merge in gravitational wave events may
therefore be explained in terms of different stellar conditions prior to
collapse, rather than different environmental factors after formation.

from Magellan IMACS spectroscopy while $L_{\rm UV}$ is derived from rest-frame

from their respective star forming sequences (i.e., $\Delta\log L_{{\rm
H}\alpha}$ and $\Delta\log L_{\rm UV}$) and after accounting for observational
uncertainties we find a small intrinsic scatter between the two quantities
($\sigma_{\delta} \lesssim 0.03$ dex). This crucial observational constraint
precludes strong fluctuations in the recent SFHs of IMGs: simple linear SFH
models indicate that a population of IMGs would be limited to only factors of
$\lesssim 2$ change in SFR over $200$ Myr and $\lesssim 30\%$ on shorter
timescales of $20$ Myr. No single characteristic SFH for IMGs, such as an
exponentially rising/falling burst, can reproduce the individual and joint
distribution of $\Delta\log L_{{\rm H}\alpha}$ and $\Delta\log L_{\rm UV}$.
Instead, an ensemble of SFHs is preferred. Finally, we find that IMG SFHs
predicted by recent hydrodynamic simulations, in which feedback drives rapid
and strong SFR fluctuations, are inconsistent with our observations.

spin liquid and quantum spin-ices, has led to the discovery of several quantum
materials where low energy pseudospin-$1/2$ doublets arise from the splitting
of spin-orbit entangled multiplets with higher degeneracy. Such systems include
$d$-orbital and $f$-orbital Mott insulators. When the gap between the low
energy pseudospin-$1/2$ levels and the excited levels of the multiplet or
`excitons' is not large, the effective low-energy exchange interactions between
the low energy pseudospin-$1/2$ moments can acquire significant corrections
from coupling to the excitons. We extract these corrections using higher order
perturbation theory as well as an exact Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. Such
corrections can impact the exchange matrix for the low energy pseudospin-$1/2$
levels by renormalizing the strength and the sign of Heisenberg exchange or
Ising anisotropies, and potentially even inducing bond-anisotropic couplings
such as Kitaev-$\Gamma$ exchange interactions. We discuss recent experiments on
various cobaltate and osmate materials which hint at the ubiquity and
importance of this physics.

thicker disk than their younger counterparts. Two competing models have
attempted to explain this result: one in which stars first form in thin disks
that gradually thicken with time through dynamical heating, and one in which
stars form in thick disks at early times and in progressively thinner disks at
later times. We use a direct measure of the thicknesses of stellar disks at
high redshift to discriminate between these scenarios. Using legacy HST imaging
from the CANDELS and GOODS surveys, we measure the rest-optical scale heights
of 491 edge-on disk galaxies spanning 0.4 < z < 2.5. We measure a median
intrinsic scale height for the full sample of 0.74 +/- 0.03 kpc, with little
redshift evolution of both the population median and scatter. The median is
consistent with the thick disk of the Milky Way today (0.6 - 1.1 kpc), but is
smaller than the median scale height of local disks (~1.5 kpc) which are
matched to our high-redshift sample by descendant mass. These findings indicate
that (1) while disks as thick as the Milky Way's thick disk were in place at
early times, (2) to explain the full disk galaxy population today, the stellar
disks in galaxies need to on average physically thicken after formation.

Striations are observed at column densities where the atomic to molecular gas
transition takes place. We explore the role of MHD waves in the CO chemistry in
regions with striations within molecular clouds. We target a region with
striations in the Polaris Flare cloud. We conduct a CO J=2-1 survey in order to
probe the molecular gas properties. We use archival starlight polarization data
and dust emission maps in order to probe the magnetic field properties and
compare against the CO properties. We assess the interaction of compressible
MHD wave modes with CO chemistry by comparing their characteristic timescales.
The estimated magnetic field is 38 - 76 $\mu$G. In the CO integrated intensity
map, we observe a dominant quasi-periodic intensity structure, which tends to
be parallel to the magnetic field orientation and has a wavelength of one
parsec approximately. The periodicity axis is $\sim$ 17 degrees off from the
mean magnetic field orientation and is also observed in the dust intensity map.
The contrast in the CO integrated intensity map is $\sim 2.4$ times larger than
the contrast of the column density map, indicating that CO formation is
enhanced locally. We suggest that a dominant slow magnetosonic mode with
estimated period $2.1 - 3.4$ Myr, and propagation speed $0.30 - 0.45$
km~s$^{-1}$, is likely to have enhanced the formation of CO, hence created the
observed periodic pattern. We also suggest that, within uncertainties, a fast
magnetosonic mode with period 0.48 Myr and velocity $2.0$ km~s$^{-1}$ could
have played some role in increasing the CO abundance. Quasiperiodic CO

variations that can be accounted for by mixing among three major constituents
having distinct isotopic compositions, namely refractory inclusions,
chondrules, and CI chondrite-like matrix. The abundances of refractory
inclusions and chondrules are coupled and systematically decrease with
increasing amount of matrix. We propose that these correlated abundance
variations reflect trapping of chondrule precursors, including refractory
inclusions, in a pressure maximum in the disk, which is likely related to the
water ice line and the ultimate formation location of Jupiter. The variable
abundance of refractory inclusions/chondrules relative to matrix is the result
of their distinct aerodynamical properties resulting in differential delivery
rates and their preferential incorporation into chondrite parent bodies during
the streaming instability, consistent with the early formation of matrix-poor
and the later accretion of matrix-rich carbonaceous chondrites. Our results
suggest that chondrules formed locally from isotopically heterogeneous dust
aggregates which themselves derive from a wide area of the disk, implying that
dust enrichment in a pressure trap was an important step to facilitate the
accretion of carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies or, more generally,
planetesimals in the outer solar system.

generate non-orthogonal subspaces. Unlike the previously studied Arnoldi
iteration, this algorithm renders the Lindbladian into a purely tridiagonal

Our study relies on two specific systems, the dissipative transverse-field
Ising model (TFIM) and the dissipative interacting XXZ chain. We find that, for
the weak coupling, initial Lanczos coefficients can efficiently distinguish

results in more fluctuations in higher Lanczos coefficients. This results in
the equal saturation of late-time complexity for both integrable and chaotic

orbital and paramagnetic effects. A recent experiment has shown that in a
Bernal stacked bilayer graphene system, the opposite occurs -- a finite
critical magnetic field is necessary to observe superconducting features
occurring in the vicinity of a magnetic phase transition. We propose an
extraordinary electronic-correlation-driven mechanism by which this anomalous
superconductivity manifests. Specifically, the electrons tend to avoid band
occupations near high density of states regions due to their mutual repulsion.
Considering the nature of spontaneous symmetry breaking involved, we dub this
avoidance Stoner blockade. We show how a magnetic field softens this blockade,
allowing weak superconductivity to take place, consistent with experimental
findings. Our principle prediction is that a small reduction of the Coulomb
repulsion would result in sizable superconductivity gains, both in achieving
higher critical temperatures and expanding the superconducting regime. Within
the theory we present, magnetic field and spin-orbit coupling of the Ising type
have a similar effect on the Bernal stacked bilayer graphene system,
elucidating the emergence of superconductivity when the system is proximitized
to a $\rm WSe_2$ substrate. We further demonstrate in this paper the
sensitivity of superconductivity to disorder in the proposed scenario. We find
that a disorder that does not violate Anderson's theorem may still induce a
reduction of $T_c$ through its effect on the density of states, establishing
the delicate nature of the Bernal bilayer graphene superconductor.

extended star formation that suffers less obscuration than their fainter
counterparts. This gives rise to a non-linear relationship between the observed
UV luminosity and the UV attenuation, that produces a double power-law shape to
the UV luminosity function of the ${\rm F{\small LARES}}$ galaxies. Spatially
distinct stellar populations within galaxies experience a wide range of dust
attenuation due to variations in the dust optical depth along the line of
sight, ranging from fully obscured to unobscured. The overall attenuation curve
of the whole galaxy is then a complex combination of those individual lines of
sight. We explore the manifestation of this effect to study the reliability of
line ratios, in particular the Balmer decrement and the BPT diagram. We find
the Balmer decrement predicted Balmer line attenuation to be very different
from those expected from commonly used attenuation curves from literature, and
the observed BPT line ratios shifted from their intrinsic dust-free values.
Finally, we explore the variation in observed properties with viewing angle,

available PQ Homomorphic Encryption (HE) libraries are based on ring LWE. The
security of LWE-based PQ cryptosystems is critical, but certain implementation
choices could weaken them. One such choice is sparse binary secrets, desirable
for PQ HE schemes for efficiency reasons. Prior work, SALSA, demonstrated a
machine learning-based attack on LWE with sparse binary secrets in small
dimensions ($n \le 128$) and low Hamming weights ($h \le 4$). However, this
attack assumes access to millions of eavesdropped LWE samples and fails at
higher Hamming weights or dimensions.
  We present PICANTE, an enhanced machine learning attack on LWE with sparse

transformer training. We also improve the secret recovery methods of SALSA and
introduce a novel cross-attention recovery mechanism allowing us to read off
the secret directly from the trained models. While PICANTE does not threaten

SALSA and could scale further, highlighting the need for future investigation

context of both detailed nebular modeling and nearby metal-poor reference
galaxies. The N IV] emission enables the first nebular density measurement in a
star-forming galaxy at $z>10$, and reveals evidence for extremely high
densities $n_e\gtrsim 10^5$ $\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. We definitively establish with
a suite of photoionization models that regardless of ionization mechanism and
accounting for depletion and this density enhancement, an ISM substantially
enriched in nitrogen ($[\mathrm{N/O}]=+0.52$) is required to reproduce the
observed lines. A search of local UV databases confirms that nearby metal-poor
galaxies power N IV] emission, but that this emission is uniformly associated
with lower densities than implied in GN-z11. We compare to a unique nearby
galaxy, Mrk~996, where a high concentration of Wolf-Rayet stars and their
CNO-processed wind ejecta produce a UV spectrum remarkably similar to that of
both GN-z11 and the Lyc-leaking super star cluster in the Sunburst Arc.
Collating this evidence in the context of Galactic stellar abundances, we
suggest that the peculiar nitrogenic features prominent in GN-z11 may be a
unique signature of intense and densely clustered star formation in the
evolutionary chain of the present-day globular clusters, consistent with
in-situ early enrichment with nuclear-processed stellar ejecta on a massive
scale. Combined with insight from local galaxies, these and future JWST data
open a powerful new window onto the physical conditions of star formation and
chemical enrichment at the highest redshifts.

for modeling correlated instrumental noise. The models are empirical, whose
only inputs are a small number of independent realizations of the same region

drawing ensembles of noise realizations. Applying these simulations to the ACT

the underlying feature extraction network to simultaneously complete the facial
region perception and face encoding. This encoder enables us to control the
face pose and attribute individually, thus enhancing the face swapping quality.
Next, we propose an adaptive latent codes swapping module to adaptively learn
the mapping between the facial attributes and the latent codes and select
effective latent codes for improved retention of facial attributes. Finally,
the initial face swapping image generated by StyleGAN2 is blended with the
facial region mask generated by our encoder to address the background blur
problem. Our framework integrating facial perceiving and blending into the
end-to-end training and testing process can achieve high realistic
face-swapping on wild faces without segmentation masks. Experimental results
demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over state-of-the-art
methods.

  applications",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recently proposed Joint Energy-based Model (JEM) interprets
discriminatively trained classifier $p(y|x)$ as an energy model, which is also
trained as a generative model describing the distribution of the input
observations $p(x)$. The JEM training relies on ""positive examples"" (i.e.
examples from the training data set) as well as on ""negative examples"", which
are samples from the modeled distribution $p(x)$ generated by means of
Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). Unfortunately, SGLD often fails
to deliver negative samples of sufficient quality during the standard JEM
training, which causes a very unbalanced contribution from the positive and
negative examples when calculating gradients for JEM updates. As a consequence,
the standard JEM training is quite unstable requiring careful tuning of
hyper-parameters and frequent restarts when the training starts diverging. This
makes it difficult to apply JEM to different neural network architectures,
modalities, and tasks. In this work, we propose a training procedure that
stabilizes SGLD-based JEM training (ST-JEM) by balancing the contribution from
the positive and negative examples. We also propose to add an additional
""regularization"" term to the training objective -- MI between the input
observations $x$ and output labels $y$ -- which encourages the JEM classifier
to make more certain decisions about output labels. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 tasks. We also
consider the task of classifying phonemes in a speech signal, for which we were
not able to train JEM without the proposed stabilization. We show that a
convincing speech can be generated from the trained model. Alternatively,
corrupted speech can be de-noised by bringing it closer to the modeled speech
distribution using a few SGLD iterations. We also propose and discuss
additional applications of the trained model.

segmentation of the reconstructed 3D volumes forms an important step in the
image processing chain for further investigation of the digitized object.
Therefore, the goal is to train a clustering algorithm on the volume, which
produces a voxelwise classification by assigning a cluster index to each voxel.
However, clustering methods, e.g., K-Means, typically have an asymptotic
polynomial runtime with respect to the dataset size, and thus, these techniques
are rarely applicable to large volumes. In this work, we introduce a novel
clustering technique based on random sampling, which allows for the voxelwise
classification of arbitrarily large volumes. The presented method conducts
efficient linear passes over the data to extract a representative random sample
of a fixed size on which the classifier can be trained. Then, a final linear
pass performs the segmentation and assigns a cluster index to each individual
voxel. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that excellent results can
be achieved even with a very small sample size. Consequently, the unsupervised
segmentation by means of clustering becomes feasible for arbitrarily large
volumes.

positioning estimation utilizing mmWave signals in urban and downtown areas. In
such areas, 5G base stations (BSs) will be densely deployed, allowing for
line-of-sight (LOS) communications between the user equipment (UE) and multiple
BSs at the same time. Having access to a plethora of measurement sources grants
the need for optimal integration between the BSs to have an accurate and
precise positioning solution. Traditionally, 5G multi-BS fusion is conducted
via an extended Kalman filter (EKF), that directly utilizes range and angle
measurements in a centralized integration scheme. Such measurements have a
non-linear relationship with the positioning states of the filter, giving rise
to linearization errors. Counter to the common belief, an unscented Kalman
filter (UKF) will fail to totally eradicate such linearization errors. In this
paper, we argue that a decentralized integration between 5G BSs would fully
avoid linearization errors within the filter and significantly enhance the
positioning performance. This is done by fusing position measurements instead
of directly fusing range and angle measurements, which inherently leads to a
linear measurement model by design. The proposed decentralized KF method was
evaluated in a quasi-real simulation setup provided by Siradel using a real

decentralized KF integration to that of centralized EKF and UKF integration

each regression $i \in [l]$ has a different vector of outcomes $y_i$. While

Subsection $4.2$ we prove an equivalence to the problem of privately releasing
the answers to a special class of low-sensitivity queries we call inner product
queries. Via this equivalence, we adapt the geometric projection-based methods
from prior work on private query release to the PRIMO setting. Under the
assumption the labels $Y$ are public, the projection gives improved results
over the Gaussian mechanism when $n < l\sqrt{d}$, with no asymptotic dependence
on $l$ in the error. In Subsection $4.3$ we study the complexity of our

to all orders in the couplings of the gauge fields to other fields within or
beyond the standard model except the axion. The induced Chern-Simons density
requires renormalization which is achieved by vacuum subtraction. For
ultralight axions of mass $m_a$ coupled to electromagnetic fields with coupling

rounding solutions to convex relaxations via low-distortion metric embeddings.
Recently, Bryant and Tupper showed that this approach extends to the hypergraph
setting by formulating a linear program whose solutions are so-called
diversities which are rounded via diversity embeddings into $\ell_1$.
Diversities are a generalization of metric spaces in which the nonnegative
function is defined on all subsets as opposed to only on pairs of elements.
  We show that this approach yields a polytime $O(\log{n})$-approximation when
either the supply or demands are given by a graph. This result improves upon
Plotkin et al.'s $O(\log{(kn)}\log{n})$-approximation, where $k$ is the number
of demands, for the setting where the supply is given by a graph and the
demands are given by a hypergraph. Additionally, we provide a polytime
$O(\min{\{r_G,r_H\}}\log{r_H}\log{n})$-approximation for when the supply and
demands are given by hypergraphs whose hyperedges are bounded in cardinality by
$r_G$ and $r_H$ respectively.
  To establish these results we provide an $O(\log{n})$-distortion $\ell_1$
embedding for the class of diversities known as diameter diversities. This
improves upon Bryant and Tupper's $O(\log\^2{n})$-distortion embedding. The
smallest known distortion with which an arbitrary diversity can be embedded
into $\ell_1$ is $O(n)$. We show that for any $\epsilon > 0$ and any $p>0$,
there is a family of diversities which cannot be embedded into $\ell_1$ in
polynomial time with distortion smaller than $O(n^{1-\epsilon})$ based on
querying the diversities on sets of cardinality at most $O(\log^p{n})$, unless
$P=NP$. This disproves (an algorithmic refinement of) Bryant and Tupper's

represented by both numeric data and urban imagery, thus necessitating a
synergetic framework to combine them. This study creates a theoretical
framework of deep hybrid models with a crossing structure consisting of a
mixing operator and a behavioral predictor, thus integrating the numeric and
imagery data into a latent space. Empirically, this framework is applied to
analyze travel mode choice using the MyDailyTravel Survey from Chicago as the
numeric inputs and the satellite images as the imagery inputs. We found that
deep hybrid models outperform both the traditional demand models and the recent
deep learning in predicting the aggregate and disaggregate travel behavior with
our supervision-as-mixing design. The latent space in deep hybrid models can be
interpreted, because it reveals meaningful spatial and social patterns. The
deep hybrid models can also generate new urban images that do not exist in
reality and interpret them with economic theory, such as computing substitution
patterns and social welfare changes. Overall, the deep hybrid models
demonstrate the complementarity between the low-dimensional numeric and
high-dimensional imagery data and between the traditional demand modeling and
recent deep learning. It generalizes the latent classes and variables in

each of them has exactly one gene from each family. Different distances of
canonical genomes can be derived from a structure called breakpoint graph,
which represents the relation between the two given genomes as a collection of
cycles of even length and paths. Then, the breakpoint distance is equal to n -
(c_2 + p_0/2), where n is the number of genes, c_2 is the number of cycles of
length 2 and p_0 is the number of paths of length 0. Similarly, when the
considered rearrangements are those modeled by the double-cut-and-join (DCJ)
operation, the rearrangement distance is n - (c + p_e/2), where c is the total
number of cycles and p_e is the total number of even paths.
  The distance formulation is a basic unit for several other combinatorial
problems related to genome evolution and ancestral reconstruction, such as
median or double distance. Interestingly, both median and double distance
problems can be solved in polynomial time for the breakpoint distance, while
they are NP-hard for the rearrangement distance. One way of exploring the
complexity space between these two extremes is to consider the {\sigma}_k
distance, defined to be n - [c_2 + c_4 + ... + c_k + (p_0 + p_2 + ... +p_k)/2],
and increasingly investigate the complexities of median and double distance for
the {\sigma}_4 distance, then the {\sigma}_6 distance, and so on. While for the
median much effort was done in our and in other research groups but no progress
was obtained even for the {\sigma}_4 distance, for solving the double distance
under {\sigma}_4 and {\sigma}_6 distances we could devise linear time
algorithms, which we present here.

magnetized. To explore the effects of magnetic fields on star formation in
these rings and nuclear gas flows, we run magnetohydrodynamic simulations in
which there is a temporally-constant magnetized inflow to the ring,
representing a bar-driven inflow. The mass inflow rate is
$1\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, and we explore models with a range of field
strength in the inflow. We adopt the TIGRESS framework developed by Kim &
Ostriker to handle radiative heating and cooling, star formation, and resulting
supernova (SN) feedback. We find that magnetic fields are efficiently amplified
in the ring due to rotational shear and SN feedback. Within a few
$100\,\mathrm{Myr}$, the turbulent component $B_\mathrm{trb}$ in the ring
saturates at $\sim 35\,\mu\mathrm{G}$ (in rough equipartition with the
turbulent kinetic energy density), while the regular component $B_\mathrm{reg}$
exceeds $50\,\mu\mathrm{G}$. Expanding superbubbles created by clustered SN
explosions vertically drag predominantly-toroidal fields from near the midplane
to produce poloidal fields in high-altitude regions. The growth of magnetic
fields greatly suppresses star formation at late times. Simultaneously, strong
magnetic tension in the ring drives radially inward accretion flows from the
ring to form a circumnuclear disk in the central region; this feature is absent
in the unmagnetized model.

avoid the high cost and potentially fatal critical mistakes. Traditionally,
self-supervised training mainly focuses on imitating previously observed
behaviors, and the training demonstrations carry no notion of which behaviors
should be explicitly avoided. In this work, we propose Control Barrier
Transformer (ConBaT), an approach that learns safe behaviors from
demonstrations in a self-supervised fashion. ConBaT is inspired by the concept
of control barrier functions in control theory and uses a causal transformer
that learns to predict safe robot actions autoregressively using a critic that
requires minimal safety data labeling. During deployment, we employ a
lightweight online optimization to find actions that ensure future states lie

electronic phase transitions. Materials possessing metallic ground states with
strong interactions between localized and itinerant electronic states are
natural candidates for the realization of such quantum phases. However, the
electronic correlations responsible for increasing the likelihood of novel
phases simultaneously place the quantum limit beyond the reach of laboratory
magnets. Here we propose these difficulties can be surmounted in materials with
strong correlations and insulating ground states. Strong correlations in
insulators and high magnetic fields conspire to fill Landau levels in the
reverse order compared to conventional metals, such that the lowest Landau
level is the first observed. Consequently, the quantum limit in strongly
correlated insulators is reached in reverse and at fields accessible in
laboratories. Quantum oscillations measured at high fields in YbB12 are shown
to have features consistent with the reverse quantum limit. These include how
quantum oscillations move in lock step with the angular evolution of the
insulator-metal transition and the field dependence of the quantum oscillation
frequency. We argue that close to the insulator-metal transition, the
insulating state should be viewed through the lens of a magnetic field-induced
electronic instability affecting the lowest Landau level states in the quantum
limit.

proteins has become a major topic in biophysics because it has been invoked as
a mechanism of compartment formation in cells, without the need for membranes.
Most of the coacervates (or condensates) are composed of Intrinsically
Disordered Proteins (IDPs) or regions that are structureless, often in
interaction with RNA and DNA. One of the more intriguing IDPs is the
526-residue RNA binding protein, Fused In Sarcoma (FUS), whose monomer
conformations and condensates exhibit unusual behavior that are sensitive to
solution conditions. By focussing principally on the N-terminus low complexity
domain (FUS-LC comprising residues 1-214) and other truncations, we rationalize
the findings of solid state NMR experiments, which show that FUS-LC adopts a
non-polymorphic fibril (core-1) involving residues 39-95, flanked by fuzzy
coats on both the N- and C- terminal ends. An alternate structure (core-2),
whose free energy is comparable to core-1, emerges only in the truncated
construct (residues 110-214). Both core-1 and core-2 fibrils are stabilized by
a Tyrosine ladder as well as hydrophilic interactions. The morphologies (gels,
fibrils, and glass-like behavior) adopted by FUS seem to vary greatly,
depending on the experimental conditions. The effect of phosphorylation is site
specific and affects the stability of the fibril depending on the sites that
are phosphorylated. Many of the peculiarities associated with FUS may also be
shared by other IDPs, such as TDP43 and hnRNPA2. We outline a number of

and make shipping frequency decisions based on the per-shipment costs and
financing costs. In this paper, I develop a model of importer-exporter
procurement where the importer procures international inputs from exporting
firms in developing countries. The exporters are credit constrained for working
capital, incur the per-shipment fixed costs, and get paid after goods are
delivered to the importer. The model shows that the shipping frequency
increases for high financing costs in origin and destination. Furthermore,
longer delivery times increase shipping frequency as well as procurement costs.
The model also shows that the higher per-shipment fixed costs reduce the
shipping frequency, in line with previous literature. Reduced transaction costs
lower the exporter's demand for financial services through shipping frequency
adjustment, mitigating the financial frictions of the firm. Then, I empirically
investigate whether the conclusions regarding the effect of per-shipment fixed
costs on shipping frequency from the theoretical model and in the existing
literature extend to developing countries. My estimation method addresses
several biases. First, I deal with aggregation bias with the firm, product, and
country-level analysis. Second, I consider the Poisson Pseudo Maximum
Likelihood (PPML) estimation method to deal with heteroscedasticity bias from
the OLS estimation of log-linear models. Third, I fix the distance
non-linearity of Bangladeshi exports. Finally, I consider the effect of
financing cost on shipping frequency to address omitted variable bias. Using
transaction-level export data from Bangladesh, I find that 10% higher
per-shipment costs reduce the shipping frequency by 3.45%. The findings are
robust to different specifications and subsamples.

adequately model the interactions between the two. Agents must therefore cope
with greater ambiguity (e.g., unknown environments, underdefined models, and
vague problem definitions). Despite the consequences of ignoring ambiguity,
tools for decision making under ambiguity are understudied. The general
approach has been to avoid ambiguity (exploit known information) using robust
methods. This work contributes ambiguity attitude graph search (AAGS),
generalizing robust methods with ambiguity attitudes--the ability to trade-off
between seeking and avoiding ambiguity in the problem. AAGS solves online
decision making problems with limited budget to learn about their environment.
To evaluate this approach AAGS is tasked with path planning in static and
dynamic environments. Results demonstrate that appropriate ambiguity attitudes
are dependent on the quality of information from the environment. In relatively
certain environments, AAGS can readily exploit information with robust
policies. Conversely, model complexity reduces the information conveyed by
individual samples; this allows the risks taken by optimistic policies to
achieve better performance.

  Generative AI from GAN to ChatGPT","44 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, ChatGPT, along with DALL-E-2 and Codex,has been gaining significant
attention from society. As a result, many individuals have become interested in
related resources and are seeking to uncover the background and secrets behind
its impressive performance. In fact, ChatGPT and other Generative AI (GAI)
techniques belong to the category of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content
(AIGC), which involves the creation of digital content, such as images, music,
and natural language, through AI models. The goal of AIGC is to make the
content creation process more efficient and accessible, allowing for the
production of high-quality content at a faster pace. AIGC is achieved by
extracting and understanding intent information from instructions provided by
human, and generating the content according to its knowledge and the intent
information. In recent years, large-scale models have become increasingly
important in AIGC as they provide better intent extraction and thus, improved
generation results. With the growth of data and the size of the models, the
distribution that the model can learn becomes more comprehensive and closer to
reality, leading to more realistic and high-quality content generation. This
survey provides a comprehensive review on the history of generative models, and
basic components, recent advances in AIGC from unimodal interaction and
multimodal interaction. From the perspective of unimodality, we introduce the
generation tasks and relative models of text and image. From the perspective of
multimodality, we introduce the cross-application between the modalities
mentioned above. Finally, we discuss the existing open problems and future
challenges in AIGC.

separate complex datasets in a supervised fashion, most of their operation
falls short to provide an informed intuition about the structure of data, and,
what is more important, about the phenomena being characterized by the given
datasets. By contrast, topological data analysis (TDA) is devoted to study the
shape of data clouds by means of persistence descriptors and provides a
quantitative characterization of specific topological features of the dataset
under scrutiny.
  In this article we introduce a novel TDA-based classifier that works on the
principle of assessing quantifiable changes on topological metrics caused by
the addition of new input to a subset of data. We used this classifier with a
high-dimensional electro-encephalographic (EEG) dataset recorded from eleven
participants during a decision-making experiment in which three motivational
states were induced through a manipulation of social pressure. After processing
a band-pass filtered version of EEG signals, we calculated silhouettes from
persistence diagrams associated with each motivated state, and classified
unlabeled signals according to their impact on each reference silhouette. Our
results show that in addition to providing accuracies within the range of those
of a nearest neighbour classifier, the TDA classifier provides formal intuition
of the structure of the dataset as well as an estimate of its intrinsic
dimension. Towards this end, we incorporated dimensionality reduction methods
to our procedure and found that the accuracy of our TDA classifier is generally
not sensitive to explained variance but rather to shape, contrary to what
happens with most machine learning classifiers.

Knowledge Distillation (KD) is an effective way to derive efficient models.
However, only a small number of KD methods tackle object detection. Also, most
of them focus on mimicking the plain features of the teacher model but rarely
consider how the features contribute to the final detection. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for knowledge distillation in object detection, named
Gradient-guided Knowledge Distillation (GKD). Our GKD uses gradient information
to identify and assign more weights to features that significantly impact the
detection loss, allowing the student to learn the most relevant features from
the teacher. Furthermore, we present bounding-box-aware multi-grained feature
imitation (BMFI) to further improve the KD performance. Experiments on the
KITTI and COCO-Traffic datasets demonstrate our method's efficacy in knowledge
distillation for object detection. On one-stage and two-stage detectors, our
GKD-BMFI leads to an average of 5.1% and 3.8% mAP improvement, respectively,

the researchers have worked with the Ethereum blockchain almost exclusively.
Even though, Ethereum and other blockchains have dynamic gas prices this is not
the case for all blockchains; many of them have fixed gas prices. Extending the
research to other blockchains with fixed gas price could broaden the scope of
the existing studies on MEV. To our knowledge, there is not a vast
understanding of MEV in fixed gas price blockchains. Therefore, we propose to
study Terra Classic as an example to understand how MEV activities affect
blockchains with fixed gas price. We first analysed the data from Terra Classic
before the UST de-peg event in May 2022 and described the nature of the
exploited arbitrage opportunities. We found more than 188K successful
arbitrages, and most of them used UST as the initial token. The capital to
perform the arbitrage was less than 1K UST in 50% of the cases, and 80% of the
arbitrages had less than four swaps. Then, we explored the characteristics that
attribute to higher MEV. We found that searchers who use more complex
mechanisms, i.e. different contracts and accounts, made higher profits.
Finally, we concluded that the most profitable searchers used a strategy of
running bots in a multi-instance environment, i.e. running bots with different
virtual machines. We measured the importance of the geographic distribution of
the virtual machines that run the bots. We found that having good geographic
coverage makes the difference between winning or losing the arbitrage
opportunities. That is because, unlike MEV extraction in Ethereum, bots in
fixed gas price blockchains are not battling a gas war; they are fighting in a
latency war.

analyzing and running mutants is computationally expensive, it is important to
prioritize those mutants that are more likely to be vulnerability mimicking

VMMS, a machine learning based approach that automatically extracts the

coefficient matrices may be nearly singular in that the condition number
$\kappa(\boldsymbol{A})$ may be close to $1/\varepsilon_{w}$, where
$\varepsilon_{w}$ denotes the unit roundoff of the working precision. It is
well known that iterative refinement (IR) can make the forward error
independent of $\kappa(\boldsymbol{A})$ if $\kappa(\boldsymbol{A})$ is
sufficiently smaller than $1/\varepsilon_{w}$ and the residual is computed in
higher precision. We propose a new iterative method, called
Forward-and-Backward Stabilized Minimal Residual or FBSMR, by conceptually
hybridizing right-preconditioned GMRES (RP-GMRES) with quasi-minimization. We
develop FBSMR based on a new theoretical framework of
essential-forward-and-backward stability (EFBS), which extends the backward
error analysis to consider the intrinsic condition number of a well-posed
problem. We stabilize the forward and backward errors in RP-GMRES to achieve
EFBS by evaluating a small portion of the algorithm in higher precision while
evaluating the preconditioner in lower precision. FBSMR can achieve optimal
accuracy in terms of both forward and backward errors for well-posed problems
with unpolluted matrices, independently of $\kappa(\boldsymbol{A})$. With
low-precision preconditioning, FBSMR can reduce the computational, memory, and
energy requirements over direct methods with or without IR. FBSMR can also
leverage parallelization-friendly classical Gram-Schmidt in Arnoldi iterations
without compromising EFBS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FBSMR using both

combines these encodings to create a knowledge graph that captures the
sentiment representation of HOIs. Compared to existing techniques, SKGHOI is
computationally efficient and allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge,

widespread use of RL trained with privacy-sensitive data in IoT devices,
especially for human-in-the-loop systems. On the one hand, RL methods enhance
the user experience by trying to adapt to the highly dynamic nature of humans.
On the other hand, trained policies can leak the user's private information.
Recent attention has been drawn to designing privacy-aware RL algorithms while
maintaining an acceptable system utility. A central challenge in designing
privacy-aware RL, especially for human-in-the-loop systems, is that humans have
intrinsic variability and their preferences and behavior evolve. The effect of
one privacy leak mitigation can be different for the same human or across
different humans over time. Hence, we can not design one fixed model for
privacy-aware RL that fits all. To that end, we propose adaPARL, an adaptive
approach for privacy-aware RL, especially for human-in-the-loop IoT systems.
adaPARL provides a personalized privacy-utility trade-off depending on human
behavior and preference. We validate the proposed adaPARL on two IoT
applications, namely (i) Human-in-the-Loop Smart Home and (ii)
Human-in-the-Loop Virtual Reality (VR) Smart Classroom. Results obtained on
these two applications validate the generality of adaPARL and its ability to
provide a personalized privacy-utility trade-off. On average, for the first
application, adaPARL improves the utility by $57\%$ over the baseline and by
$43\%$ over randomization. adaPARL also reduces the privacy leak by $23\%$ on

[Bernien et al., Nature 551, 579 (2017)] has led to the discovery of quantum

experimental findings in the Rydberg chain can be well captured by a
kinetically constrained model called the ""PXP"" model, which has been shown to
host the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH)-violating scar states in
the middle of the spectrum. Much effort has been put into identifying similar
kinetically restricted systems that show a violation of ETH. In this work, we
study the QMBS that can arise in one such model, namely the spin-$1$ Kitaev
chain, where owing to some conserved quantities, the Hilbert space gets
fragmented into unequal disconnected subspaces. Recently, You et al. [Phys.
Rev. Research 4, 013103 (2022)] showed that the ground state sector of this
chain can be mapped exactly onto the prototypical PXP model and thus hosts
QMBSs. Here, we demonstrate that the phenomenon of scarring is also present in
other sectors, and in particular, we identify a sector that exhibits
substantially more scarring than the ground state one. We propose an initial
state and numerically demonstrate that its fidelity revivals are robust and
longer-lived than those in the PXP model.

Moir\'e and other modulated two dimensional systems. In this work, flat-bands
are shown to exist in uniaxially periodic strained graphene. Such strain should
be produced for example by a substrate. The model is thus mapped into a
one-dimensional effective Hamiltonian and this allows to find the conditions
for having flat-bands, i.e., a long-wavelength modulation only on each one of
the bipartite graphene sublattices, while having a tagged strain field between
neighboring carbon atoms. The origin of such flat-bands is thus tracked down to
the existence of topological localized wavefunctions at domain walls separating
different regions, each with a non-uniform Su-Schriffer-Hegger model (SSH) type
of coupling. Thereafter, the system is mapped into a continuum model allowing
to explain the numerical results in terms of the Jackiw-Rebbi model and of
pseudo-Landau levels. Finally, the interplay between the obtained flat-bands
and electron-electron interaction is explored through the Hubbard model. The
numerical results within the mean-field approximation indicate that the
flat-bands induce N\'eel antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic domains even for a
very weak Hubbard interaction. The present model thus provides a simple
platform to understand the physical origin of flat-bands, pseudo-Landau levels

congestion might increase. In this paper, we propose that in mixed-autonomy

autonomous cars, the headway of autonomous cars can be directly controlled to
influence vehicles' routing and reduce congestion. We argue that the headway of
autonomous cars -- and consequently the capacity of link segments -- is not
just a fixed design choice; but rather, it can be leveraged as an
{infrastructure control} strategy to {dynamically} regulate capacities. Imagine
that similar to variable speed limits which regulate the maximum speed of
vehicles on a road segment, a control policy regulates the headway of
autonomous cars along each road segment. We seek to influence vehicles' route
choices by directly controlling the headway of autonomous cars to prevent
Braess-like unexpected outcomes and increase network efficiency. We model the
dynamics of mixed-autonomy traffic networks while accounting for the vehicles'
route choice dynamics. We train an RL policy that learns to regulate the
headway of autonomous cars such that the total travel time in the network is
minimized. We will show empirically that our trained policy can not only

multiple behaviors by different subgroups, while maintaining global and
subgroup line-of-sight (LOS) network connectivity that minimally constrains the
original multi-robot behaviors. The LOS connectivity between pairwise robots is
preserved when two robots stay within the limited communication range and their
LOS remains occlusion-free from static obstacles while moving. By using control
barrier functions (CBF) and minimum volume enclosing ellipsoids (MVEE), we
first introduce the LOS connectivity barrier certificate (LOS-CBC) to
characterize the state-dependent admissible control space for pairwise robots,
from which their resulting motion will keep the two robots LOS connected over
time. We then propose the Minimum Line-of-Sight Connectivity Constraint
Spanning Tree (MLCCST) as a step-wise bilevel optimization framework to jointly
optimize (a) the minimum set of LOS edges to actively maintain, and (b) the
control revision with respect to a nominal multi-robot controller due to LOS
connectivity maintenance. As proved in the theoretical analysis, this allows
the robots to improvise the optimal composition of LOS-CBC control constraints
that are least constraining around the nominal controllers, and at the same
time enforce the global and subgroup LOS connectivity through the resulting
preserved set of pairwise LOS edges. The framework thus leads to robots staying
as close to their nominal behaviors, while exhibiting dynamically changing
LOS-connected network topology that provides the greatest flexibility for the
existing multi-robot tasks in real time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach through simulations with up to 64 robots.

considered exclusively noise with persistent root-mean-square amplitude and
overlooked an opportunity of adjusting the amplitudes to alleviate the adverse
effects of the noise. This paper presents a new DP perturbation mechanism with
a time-varying noise amplitude to protect the privacy of FL and retain the
capability of adjusting the learning performance. Specifically, we propose a
geometric series form for the noise amplitude and reveal analytically the
dependence of the series on the number of global aggregations and the
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP requirement. We derive an online refinement of the
series to prevent FL from premature convergence resulting from excessive
perturbation noise. Another important aspect is an upper bound developed for
the loss function of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained by FL running the
new DP mechanism. Accordingly, the optimal number of global aggregations is
obtained, balancing the learning and privacy. Extensive experiments are
conducted using MLP, supporting vector machine, and convolutional neural

feature extraction capability in complex and noisy environments, limiting the
development of accurate and reliable object distinction. Method: To this end,
we present DenseSPH-YOLOv5, a real-time DL-based high-performance damage
detection model where DenseNet blocks have been integrated with the backbone to
improve in preserving and reusing critical feature information. Additionally,
convolutional block attention modules (CBAM) have been implemented to improve

the authors are able to optimize power systems' inherent resilience as
ecosystems through network design and system operation. A previous model used
on real power flows and aggregated redundant components for a rigorous mapping
between ecosystems and power systems. However, the reactive power flows also
determine power systems resilience; and the power components' redundancy is
part of the global network redundancy. These characteristics should be
considered for RECO-oriented evaluation and optimization for power systems.
Thus, this paper extends the model for quantifying RECO in power systems using
real, reactive, and apparent power flows with the consideration of redundant

over $D \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is a function of two variables which acts as a
continuous function in the first variable and as a real Radon measure in the
second. Some analytical properties of such kernels are studied, particularly in
the case of cross-positive-definite type kernels. The self-integral of $K$ over
a bounded set $D$ is the ""integral of $K$ with respect to itself"". It is
defined using Riemann sums and denoted $\int_{D}K(x,dx)$. Some examples where
such notion is well-defined are presented. This concept turns out to be crucial
for unique-definiteness of stochastic integrals, that is, when the integral is
independent of the way of approaching it. If $K$ is the cross-covariance kernel
between a mean-square continuous stochastic process $Z$ and a random measure
with measure covariance structure $M$, $\int_{D}K(x,dx)$ is the expectation of
the stochastic integral $\int_{D} ZdM$ when both are uniquely-defined. It is
also proven that when $Z$ and $M$ are jointly Gaussian, self-integrability
properties on $K$ are necessary and sufficient to guarantee the
unique-definiteness of $\int_{D}ZdM$. Results on integrations over subsets, as
well as potential $\sigma$-additive structures are obtained. Three applications
of these results are proposed, involving tensor products of Gaussian random
measures, the study of a uniquely-defined stochastic integral with respect to
fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H > \frac{1}{2}$, and the
non-uniquely-defined stochastic integrals with respect to orthogonal random

This allows us to privatize existing non-private algorithms in a blackbox

of a reference utterance to the generated target synthetic speech. This is done
by using a learned embedding of the reference utterance, which is used to
condition speech generation. During training, the reference utterance is
identical to the target utterance. Yet, during synthesis, these models are
often used to transfer prosody from a reference that differs from the text or
speaker being synthesized.
  To address this inconsistency, we propose to use a different, but
prosodically-related, utterance during training too. We believe this should
encourage the model to learn to transfer only those characteristics that the
reference and target have in common. If prosody transfer methods do indeed
transfer prosody they should be able to be trained in the way we propose.
However, results show that a model trained under these conditions performs
significantly worse than one trained using the target utterance as a reference.
To explain this, we hypothesize that prosody transfer models do not learn a
transferable representation of prosody, but rather an utterance-level
representation which is highly dependent on both the reference speaker and
reference text.

Nevertheless, a central challenge in designing many of these IoT systems arises
from the requirement to infer the human mental state, such as intention,
stress, cognition load, or learning ability. While different human contexts can
be inferred from the fusion of different sensor modalities that can correlate
to a particular mental state, the human brain provides a richer sensor modality
that gives us more insights into the required human context. This paper
proposes ERUDITE, a human-in-the-loop IoT system for the learning environment

insights from concept learning theory, ERUDITE can infer the human state of

quantifying human learning as an input sensory signal, ERUDITE can provide
adequate personalized feedback to humans in a learning environment to enhance
their learning experience. ERUDITE is evaluated across $15$ participants and
showed that by using the brain signals as a sensor modality to infer the human

much greater than that of air. Little is known about their inertial dynamics,
mainly because experiments with such heavy, sub-millimetre particles in air are
difficult. We tracked the inertial dynamics of heavy sub-millimetre spheroids
through still air and observed that their orientations fluctuate considerably,
in stark contrast to the rapid alignment seen in high-density fluids such as
water. A model, that quantitatively describes the resulting transient
oscillations of the particle orientation, shows that the oscillations are due
to particle inertia, and allows us to study the effect of particle shape and
volume, beyond the parameters of the experiment. We discuss implications for
the angular dynamics of such particles in turbulent air. We conclude that the
particle inertia can significantly delay the alignment and increase angular
fluctuations. This has significant implications for the statistics of particle
orientation, affecting settling velocities and atmospheric residence times,
collision/aggregation mechanism and how the particles scatter and absorb solar
radiation.

guarantees for robot navigation. Traditional approaches consider fixed CBFs
during navigation and hand-tune the underlying parameters apriori. Such
approaches are inefficient and vulnerable to changes in the environment. The
goal of this paper is to learn CBFs for multi-robot navigation based on what
robots perceive about their environment. In order to guarantee the feasibility
of the navigation task, while ensuring robot safety, we pursue a trade-off
between conservativeness and aggressiveness in robot behavior by defining
dynamic environment-aware CBF constraints. Since the explicit relationship
between CBF constraints and navigation performance is challenging to model, we
leverage reinforcement learning to learn time-varying CBFs in a model-free
manner. We parameterize the CBF policy with graph neural networks (GNNs), and
design GNNs that are translation invariant and permutation equivariant, to
synthesize decentralized policies that generalize across environments. The
proposed approach maintains safety guarantees (due to the underlying CBFs),
while optimizing navigation performance (due to the reward-based learning). We
perform simulations that compare the proposed approach with fixed CBFs tuned by
exhaustive grid-search. The results show that environment-aware CBFs are
capable of adapting to robot movements and obstacle changes, yielding improved
navigation performance and robust generalization.

involve application-dependent aspects. Particularly, when considering
autonomous driving applications, the robustness-efficiency trade-off, as well

hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). Young immature GCs (imGCs) appear through adult
neurogenesis. In comparison to the mature GCs (mGCs) (born during development),
the imGCs show high activation due to lower firing threshold. On the other
hand, they receive low excitatory drive from the entorhinal cortex via
perforant paths and from the hilar mossy cells with lower connection
probability $p_c~(=20~x~\%)$ ($x:$ synaptic connectivity fraction; $ 0 \leq x

the effect of low excitatory innervation (reducing activation degree) for the
imGCs counteracts the effect of their high excitability. We consider a spiking
neural network for the DG, incorporating both the mGCs and the imGCs. With
decreasing $x$ from 1 to 0, we investigate the effect of young adult-born imGCs
on the sparsely synchronized rhythms (SSRs) of the GCs (mGCs, imGC, and whole
GCs). For each $x$, population and individual firing behaviors in the SSRs are
characterized in terms of the amplitude measure ${\cal M}_a^{(X)}$

phase-locking degree ${\cal L}_d^{(X)}$ (characterizing the regularity of
individual single-cell discharges), respectively. We also note that, for $0

process of transforming similar input patterns into less similar output
patterns) and pattern integration (making association between patterns),
respectively. Quantitative relationship between SSRs and pattern separation and
integration is also discussed.

information of the origami structure to model origami dynamics in an efficient
and accurate manner. In particular, an improved version of DMD with control,
that we term geometry-informed dynamic mode decomposition~(giDMD), is developed

reveal the efficacy and interpretability. We show that giDMD can accurately
predict the dynamics of an origami chain across frequencies, where the
topological boundary state can be identified by the characteristics of giDMD.
Moreover, the periodic intrawell motion can be accurately predicted in the dual
origami structure. The type of dynamics in the dual origami structure can also
be identified. The model learned by the giDMD also reveals the influential
geometrical parameters in the origami dynamics, indicating the interpretability
of this method. The accurate prediction of chaotic dynamics remains a challenge
for the method. Nevertheless, we expect that the proposed giDMD approach will

to other tree-level amplitudes related by crossing symmetry such as $\gamma f

has attracted the attention of many researchers. These problems are usually
modeled and solved as variants of vehicle routing problems (VRPs) with
challenging real-world constraints (e.g., time windows, precedence). However,
despite many decades of solid research on solving these VRP instances, we still
see significant gaps between optimized routes and the routes that are actually
preferred by the practitioners. Most of these gaps are due to the difference
between what's being optimized, and what the practitioners actually care about,
which is hard to be defined exactly in many instances. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical route optimizer with learnable parameters that
combines the strength of both the optimization and machine learning approaches.
Our hierarchical router first solves a zone-level Traveling Salesman Problem
with learnable weights on various zone-level features; with the zone visit
sequence fixed, we then solve the stop-level vehicle routing problem as a
Shortest Hamiltonian Path problem. The Bayesian optimization approach is then
introduced to allow us to adjust the weights to be assigned to different zone
features used in solving the zone-level Traveling Salesman Problem. By using a
real-world delivery dataset provided by the Amazon Last Mile Routing Research
Challenge, we demonstrate the importance of having both the optimization and
the machine learning components. We also demonstrate how we can use
route-related features to identify instances that we might have difficulty
with. This paves ways to further research on how we can tackle these difficult

Since a taxi driver can work for a limited number of hours in a day (e.g., 8-10

this corresponds to solving a large-scale multi-stage selfish routing game with

unable to handle ``driver"" constraints (e.g., breaks during work hours) or not

Taking advantage of both advanced explicit learning process and powerful
representation ability of implicit functions, we propose a novel 3D
representation method, Neural Vector Fields (NVF). It not only adopts the
explicit learning process to manipulate meshes directly, but also leverages the
implicit representation of unsigned distance functions (UDFs) to break the
barriers in resolution and topology. Specifically, our method first predicts
the displacements from queries towards the surface and models the shapes as
\textit{Vector Fields}. Rather than relying on network differentiation to
obtain direction fields as most existing UDF-based methods, the produced vector
fields encode the distance and direction fields both and mitigate the ambiguity
at ""ridge"" points, such that the calculation of direction fields is
straightforward and differentiation-free. The differentiation-free
characteristic enables us to further learn a shape codebook via Vector
Quantization, which encodes the cross-object priors, accelerates the training
procedure, and boosts model generalization on cross-category reconstruction.

LiDAR scans and allows precise segmentation of unknown instances. Furthermore,
a diffuse searching method is proposed to handle the common over-segmentation
problem presented in the known instances. With the combination of these

Rules, ``manners,'' laws, and moral imperatives are examples of classes of
constraints that govern human behavior. These systems of constraints are
``messy:'' individual constraints are often poorly defined, what constraints
are relevant in a particular situation may be unknown or ambiguous, constraints
interact and conflict with one another, and determining how to act within the
bounds of the relevant constraints may be a significant challenge, especially
when rapid decisions are needed. Despite such messiness, humans incorporate
constraints in their decisions robustly and rapidly. General,
artificially-intelligent agents must also be able to navigate the messiness of
systems of real-world constraints in order to behave predictability and
reliably. In this paper, we characterize sources of complexity in constraint
processing for general agents and describe a computational-level analysis for
such \textit{constraint compliance}. We identify key algorithmic requirements
based on the computational-level analysis and outline an initial, exploratory
implementation of a general approach to constraint compliance.

data acquired by non-uniform linear arrays (NLAs) in automotive applications.
Atomic norm minimization (ANM) is a promising gridless sparse recovery
algorithm under the Toeplitz model and solved by convex relaxation, thus it is
only applicable to uniform linear arrays (ULAs) with array manifolds having a
Vandermonde structure. In automotive applications, it is essential to apply the
gridless DoA estimation to NLAs with arbitrary geometry with efficiency. In
this paper, a fast ANM-based gridless DoA estimation algorithm for NLAs is
proposed, which employs the array manifold separation technique and the
accelerated proximal gradient (APG) technique, making it applicable to NLAs
without losing of efficiency. Simulation and measurement experiments on
automotive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method.

modeled in algebraic form via (non)linear mixed-integer programming. A more
systematic approach to modeling such systems is to use Generalized Disjunctive
Programming (GDP), which extends the Disjunctive Programming paradigm proposed
by Egon Balas to allow modeling systems from a logic-based level of abstraction
that captures the fundamental rules governing such systems via algebraic
constraints and logic. Although GDP provides a more general way of modeling
systems, it warrants further generalization to encompass systems presenting a
hierarchical structure. This work extends the GDP literature to address three
major alternatives for modeling and solving systems with nested (hierarchical)
disjunctions: explicit nested disjunctions, equivalent single-level
disjunctions, and flattening via basic steps. We also provide theoretical
proofs on the relaxation tightness of such alternatives, showing that
explicitly modeling nested disjunctions is superior to the traditional approach
discussed in literature for dealing with nested disjunctions.

of segmenting the prominent object in videos without manual guidance. In other
words, the network detects the accurate region of the target object in a
sequence of RGB frames without prior knowledge. In recent works, two approaches
for UVOS have been discussed that can be divided into: appearance and
appearance-motion based methods. Appearance based methods utilize the
correlation information of inter-frames to capture target object that commonly
appears in a sequence. However, these methods does not consider the motion of
target object due to exploit the correlation information between randomly
paired frames. Appearance-motion based methods, on the other hand, fuse the
appearance features from RGB frames with the motion features from optical flow.
Motion cue provides useful information since salient objects typically show
distinctive motion in a sequence. However, these approaches have the limitation
that the dependency on optical flow is dominant. In this paper, we propose a
novel framework for UVOS that can address aforementioned limitations of two
approaches in terms of both time and scale. Temporal Alignment Fusion aligns
the saliency information of adjacent frames with the target frame to leverage
the information of adjacent frames. Scale Alignment Decoder predicts the target
object mask precisely by aggregating differently scaled feature maps via
continuous mapping with implicit neural representation. We present experimental
results on public benchmark datasets, DAVIS 2016 and FBMS, which demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, we outperform the

for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the dynamic changes in flight
maneuver and viewpoint encountered in UAV tracking pose significant
difficulties, e.g. , aspect ratio change, and scale variation. The conventional
cross-correlation operation, while commonly used, has limitations in
effectively capturing perceptual similarity and incorporates extraneous

novel saliency-guided dynamic vision Transformer (SGDViT) for UAV tracking. The
proposed method designs a new task-specific object saliency mining network to
refine the cross-correlation operation and effectively discriminate foreground

operation dynamically generates tokens based on initial saliency, thereby
reducing the computational complexity of the Transformer architecture. Finally,
a lightweight saliency filtering Transformer further refines saliency

demographic subgroups into the class of functions~$\mathcal{C}$. Recent work
has shown that, by enriching the class $\mathcal{C}$ to incorporate appropriate

target-independent learning, wherein a model trained on a source domain
performs well on unseen, future, target domains(approximately) captured by the

$\big|\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\sim \mathcal{D}}[c(f(x),x)\cdot(f(x)-y)]\big|$ for all

find that the MAEs of the Fe/LiF/MgO and the Fe/FeF/LiF/MgO structures are
almost the same as that of the Fe/MgO structure, while the MAE of the
Fe/FeO/MgO structure is less than a half of that of the Fe/MgO structure. The
results show that the major origin of the enhancement of the PMA obtained by
inserting an ultrathin LiF layer at an Fe/MgO interface is the suppression of
the mixing of Fe and O atoms at the interface. We also find that the in-plane
Fe-F coupling gives a positive contribution to the MAE while the in-plane Fe-O
coupling gives a negative contribution. The results are useful for designing of

essential development consists of two new on-policy evaluation operators and a
novel analysis of the stochastic policy mirror descent method (SPMD). SPMD with
the first evaluation operator, called value-based estimation, tailors to the
Kullback-Leibler divergence. Provided the Markov chains on the state space of
generated policies are uniformly mixing with non-diminishing minimal visitation

transfer, where Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) can be used to reduce the
domain shifts. Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to transfer knowledge
from a well-labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain under the
assumption that the target domain contains unknown classes. Existing OSDA
methods consistently lay stress on the covariate shift, ignoring the potential
label shift problem. The performance of OSDA methods degrades drastically under
intra-domain class imbalance and inter-domain label shift. However, little
attention has been paid to this issue in the community. In this paper, the
Imbalanced Open Set Domain Adaptation (IOSDA) is explored where the covariate
shift, label shift and category mismatch exist simultaneously. To alleviate the
negative effects raised by label shift in OSDA, we propose Open-set
Moving-threshold Estimation and Gradual Alignment (OMEGA) - a novel
architecture that improves existing OSDA methods on class-imbalanced data.
Specifically, a novel unknown-aware target clustering scheme is proposed to
form tight clusters in the target domain to reduce the negative effects of
label shift and intra-domain class imbalance. Furthermore, moving-threshold
estimation is designed to generate specific thresholds for each target sample
rather than using one for all. Extensive experiments on IOSDA, OSDA and OPDA
benchmarks demonstrate that our method could significantly outperform existing
state-of-the-arts. Code and data are available at

element theory and the quasi-steady model are put forward to compute the
flapping wing aerodynamics based on wing kinematics. Translational lift,
translational drag, rotational lift, and added mass force are all considered in
the computation. Then we use the proposed simulation platform to investigate
the passive wing rotation and the wing-tail interaction phenomena of a
particular flapping-wing robot. With the help of the simulation tool and a
novel statistic based on dynamic differences from the averaged system, several
behaviors display their essence by investigating the flapping wing robot
dynamic characteristics. After that, the attitude tracking control problem and
the positional trajectory tracking problem are both overcome by robust control
techniques. Further comparison simulations reveal that the proposed control
algorithms compared with other existing ones show apparent superiority. What is
more, with the same control algorithm and parameters tuned in simulation, we
conduct real flight experiments on a self-made flapping wing robot, and obtain
similar results from the proposed simulation platform. In contrast to existing
simulation tools, the proposed one is compatible with most existing flapping
wing robots, and can inherently drill into each subtle behavior in
corresponding applications by observing aerodynamic forces and torques on each

translation) and middleboxes (caches, load balancers) have moved from
purpose-built appliances to software-based components. However, L2/L3 network
functions (NFs) are being implemented on Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
platforms that extensively exploit kernel-bypass technology. They often use
DPDK for zero-copy delivery and high performance. On the other hand, L4/L7
middleboxes, which have a greater emphasis on functionality, take advantage of
a full-fledged kernel-based system.
  L2/L3 NFs and L4/L7 middleboxes continue to be handled by distinct platforms
on different nodes. This paper proposes MiddleNet that develops a unified
network resident function framework that supports L2/L3 NFs and L4/L7
middleboxes. MiddleNet supports function chains that are essential in both NFV
and middlebox environments. MiddleNet uses the Data Plane Development Kit
(DPDK) library for zero-copy packet delivery without interrupt-based
processing, to enable the ""bump-in-the-wire"" L2/L3 processing performance
required of NFV. To support L4/L7 middlebox functionality, MiddleNet utilizes a
consolidated, kernel-based protocol stack for processing, avoiding a dedicated
protocol stack for each function. MiddleNet fully exploits the event-driven
capabilities of the extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) and seamlessly
integrates it with shared memory for high-performance communication in L4/L7
middlebox function chains. The overheads for MiddleNet in L4/L7 are strictly
load-proportional, without needing the dedicated CPU cores of DPDK-based
approaches. MiddleNet supports flow-dependent packet processing by leveraging
Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) to dynamically select the packet
processing needed (Layers 2 - 7). Our experimental results show that MiddleNet
achieves high performance in such a unified environment.

geostationary satellite resolution has improved, the long-term analysis of
climate applications is limited to using multiple satellites from the past to
the present due to the different resolutions. To solve this problem, we
proposed warp and refine network (WR-Net). WR-Net is divided into an optical
flow warp component and a warp image refinement component. We used the TV-L1
algorithm instead of deep learning-based approaches to extract the optical flow
warp component. The deep-learning-based model is trained on the human-centric
view of the RGB channel and does not work on geostationary satellites, which is
gray-scale one-channel imagery. The refinement network refines the warped image
through a multi-temporal fusion layer. We evaluated WR-Net by interpolation of
temporal resolution at 4 min intervals to 2 min intervals in large-scale GK2A
geostationary meteorological satellite imagery. Furthermore, we applied WR-Net
to the future frame prediction task and showed that the explicit use of optical

driven the need for theoretical tools to describe conduction processes that

molecular length scales, however, deviations from Fourier's law are common in
part because microscale thermal transport properties typically depend on the
complex interplay between multiple heat conduction mechanisms. Here, the
thermal transport properties that arise from electron transfer across a thermal
gradient in a molecular conduction junction are examined theoretically. We
illustrate how transport in a model junction is affected by varying the
electronic structure and length of the molecular bridge in the junction as well
as the strength of the coupling between the bridge and its surrounding
environment. Three findings are of note: First, the transport properties can
vary significantly depending on the characteristics of the molecular bridge and
its environment; second, the system's thermal conductance commonly deviates

electron hopping thermal conductance is similar to what has been measured in

than any known optical transient. The decline is smooth and exponential and the
ultra-violet - optical spectral energy distribution resembles a black body with

low-latency communications (URLLC) with massive devices. Specifically, the
active devices transmit their uplink access signals in a grant-free manner to
realize ultra-low access latency. Meanwhile, the base station aims to achieve
ultra-reliable data detection under severe inter-device interference without
exploiting explicit channel state information (CSI). We first propose an
efficient transmitter design, where a small amount of reference information
(RI) is embedded in the access signal to resolve the inherent ambiguities
incurred by the unknown CSI. At the receiver, we further develop a successive
interference cancellation-based semi-blind detection scheme, where a bilinear
generalized approximate message passing algorithm is utilized for joint channel
and signal estimation (JCSE), while the embedded RI is exploited for ambiguity
elimination. Particularly, a rank selection approach and a RI-aided
initialization strategy are incorporated to reduce the algorithmic
computational complexity and to enhance the JCSE reliability, respectively.
Besides, four enabling techniques are integrated to satisfy the stringent
latency and reliability requirements of massive URLLC. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed semi-blind detection framework offers a better
scalability-latency-reliability tradeoff than the state-of-the-art detection
schemes dedicated to sourced or unsourced RA.

domain of high kinetic energies. The isospin diffusion in heavy-ion collisions
influences the neutron/proton ratio in the high-density region. The

confidence intervals for the value of the optimal regime and structural
parameters associated with it is inherently harder, as it involves non-linear

Segmentation quality assessment efforts have focused on natural images, where
the problem has been typically formulated as a dice score regression task. In
this paper, we propose a simplified Fetal Ultrasound Segmentation Quality
Assessment (FUSQA) model to tackle the segmentation quality assessment when no
masks exist to compare with. We formulate the segmentation quality assessment
process as an automated classification task to distinguish between good and
poor-quality segmentation masks for more accurate gestational age estimation.
We validate the performance of our proposed approach on two datasets we collect
from two hospitals using different ultrasound machines. We compare different
architectures, with our best-performing architecture achieving over 90%
classification accuracy on distinguishing between good and poor-quality
segmentation masks from an unseen dataset. Additionally, there was only a
1.45-day difference between the gestational age reported by doctors and
estimated based on CRL measurements using well-segmented masks. On the other
hand, this difference increased and reached up to 7.73 days when we calculated
CRL from the poorly segmented masks. As a result, AI-based approaches can
potentially aid fetal ultrasound segmentation quality assessment and might
detect poor segmentation in real-time screening in the future.

static limit with very large quark masses when the Coulomb interaction

represents the standard soft-wall holographic model, in which, however, the
quadratic dilaton background is replaced by the linear one. The given
replacement converts a Regge-like spectrum into a Hydrogen-like one. The mass
scale introduced by the linear dilaton matches the quark mass in a natural way.
The resulting model is analyzed for the scalar, vector and tensor cases. We
also demonstrate that the spectrum of considered holographic model shares
several common features with the recently found spectrum of open string

self-supervised visual representation learning, but there still lacks a
rigorous understanding of its learning dynamics. In this paper, we show that if
we cast a contrastive objective equivalently into the feature space, then its
learning dynamics admits an interpretable form. Specifically, we show that its
gradient descent corresponds to a specific message passing scheme on the
corresponding augmentation graph. Based on this perspective, we theoretically
characterize how contrastive learning gradually learns discriminative features
with the alignment update and the uniformity update. Meanwhile, this
perspective also establishes an intriguing connection between contrastive
learning and Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). This connection
not only provides a unified understanding of many techniques independently
developed in each community, but also enables us to borrow techniques from
MP-GNNs to design new contrastive learning variants, such as graph attention,
graph rewiring, jumpy knowledge techniques, etc. We believe that our message
passing perspective not only provides a new theoretical understanding of
contrastive learning dynamics, but also bridges the two seemingly independent
areas together, which could inspire more interleaving studies to benefit from
each other. The code is available at

modern approximation. These approaches are able to produce accurate
approximations to nonsmooth and non-Lipschitz functions, including multivariate

approximation using rational approximation, neural network and their
combinations. It was found that rational approximation is superior to neural
network based approaches with the same number of decision variables. Our
numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of rational approximation,
even when the number of approximation parameters (that is, the dimension of the
corresponding optimisation problems) is small. Another important contribution
of this paper lies in the improvement of rational approximation algorithms.
Namely, the optimisation based algorithms for rational approximation can be
adjusted to in such a way that the conditioning number of the constraint
matrices are controlled. This simple adjustment enables us to work with high
dimension optimisation problems and improve the design of the neural network.
The main strength of neural networks is in their ability to handle models with
a large number of variables: complex models are decomposed in several simple
optimisation problems. Therefore the the large number of decision variables is
in the nature of neural networks.

complex black box. At inference, any input of the hybrid model is assigned to
either its interpretable or complex component based on a gating mechanism. The
advantages of such models over classical ones are two-fold: 1) They grant users
precise control over the level of transparency of the system and 2) They can
potentially perform better than a standalone black box since redirecting some
of the inputs to an interpretable model implicitly acts as regularization.
Still, despite their high potential, hybrid models remain under-studied in the
interpretability/explainability literature. In this paper, we remedy this fact
by presenting a thorough investigation of such models from three perspectives:
Theory, Taxonomy, and Methods. First, we explore the theory behind the
generalization of hybrid models from the Probably-Approximately-Correct (PAC)
perspective. A consequence of our PAC guarantee is the existence of a sweet
spot for the optimal transparency of the system. When such a sweet spot is
attained, a hybrid model can potentially perform better than a standalone black
box. Secondly, we provide a general taxonomy for the different ways of training
hybrid models: the Post-Black-Box and Pre-Black-Box paradigms. These approaches
differ in the order in which the interpretable and complex components are
trained. We show where the state-of-the-art hybrid models Hybrid-Rule-Set and
Companion-Rule-List fall in this taxonomy. Thirdly, we implement the two
paradigms in a single method: HybridCORELS, which extends the CORELS algorithm
to hybrid modeling. By leveraging CORELS, HybridCORELS provides a certificate
of optimality of its interpretable component and precise control over
transparency. We finally show empirically that HybridCORELS is competitive with
existing hybrid models, and performs just as well as a standalone black box (or
even better) while being partly transparent.

counterintuitively reinforced by tensile forces, play a major role in cell
adhesion under mechanical stress. A basic prerequisite for catch-bond formation
is that force-induced remodeling of ligand binding interface occurs prior to
bond rupture. However, what strategy receptor proteins utilize to meet such
specific kinetic control is still unclear, rendering the mechanistic
understanding of catch-bond an open question. Here we report a bidirectional
allostery mechanism of catch-bond for the hyaluronan (HA) receptor CD44 which
is responsible for rolling adhesion of lymphocytes and circulating tumor cells.
Binding of ligand HA allosterically reduces the threshold force for unlocking
of otherwise stably folded force-sensing element (i.e., forward allostery), so
that much smaller tensile force can trigger the conformational switching of
receptor protein to high binding-strength state via backward allosteric
coupling before bond rupture. The effect of forward allostery was further
supported by performing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Such
bidirectional allostery mechanism fulfills the specific kinetic control
required by catch-bond and is likely to be commonly utilized in cell adhesion.
We also revealed a slip-catch-slip triphasic pattern in force response of
CD44-HA bond arising from force-induced repartitioning of parallel dissociation
pathways. The essential thermodynamic and kinetic features of receptor proteins
for shaping the catch-bond were identified.

method to transform model-driven into data-driven LMI conditions is presented.
This technical solution is demonstrated to be equivalent to the recent advanced
results on LMI formulations based on S-procedure or Peterson Lemmas. However,
the advantage of the proposed method relies on its simplicity and its potential
to be applicable to a wide class of problems of stabilization of (non)linear
discrete-time systems. The method is then illustrated on an academic example.

estimation. However, the training data must be captured in scenes without
moving objects. To push the envelope of accuracy, recent methods tend to
increase their model parameters. In this paper, an unsupervised learning
framework is proposed to jointly predict monocular depth and complete 3D motion
including the motions of moving objects and camera. (1) Recurrent modulation
units are used to adaptively and iteratively fuse encoder and decoder features.
This not only improves the single-image depth inference but also does not
overspend model parameters. (2) Instead of using a single set of filters for
upsampling, multiple sets of filters are devised for the residual upsampling.
This facilitates the learning of edge-preserving filters and leads to the
improved performance. (3) A warping-based network is used to estimate a motion
field of moving objects without using semantic priors. This breaks down the
requirement of scene rigidity and allows to use general videos for the
unsupervised learning. The motion field is further regularized by an
outlier-aware training loss. Despite the depth model just uses a single image
in test time and 2.97M parameters, it achieves state-of-the-art results on the
KITTI and Cityscapes benchmarks.

Full Point Transformer (FPTransformer) architectures. The key idea is to
adaptively learn the weights from local and global geometric connections, where
the connections are established through local and global correlation functions

global geometric relationships as well as their internal correlations,
demonstrating strong generalization ability and high performance. FPConv is
incorporated in classical hierarchical network architectures to achieve local

position encoding in self-attention, that hierarchically encodes each point
position in the global and local receptive field. We also propose a shape aware
downsampling block which takes into account the local shape and the global

the efficacy of FPConv and FPTransformer for semantic segmentation, object

cooperation is reversed in upstream reciprocity, which instead follows the
pattern, 'You helped me, and I will help someone else'. In reality, these two
types of indirect reciprocity often occur in combination. However, upstream and
downstream reciprocity have mostly been studied theoretically in isolation.
Here, we propose a new model that integrates both types. We apply the standard
giving-game framework of indirect reciprocity and analyze the model by means of
evolutionary game theory. We show that the model can result in the stable
coexistence of altruistic reciprocators and free riders in well-mixed
populations. We also found that considering inattention in the assessment rule

How these phase transitions manifest within the quantum transport and shot
noise signatures remain an open question thus far. Here, we show that the Fano
factor converges to the universal $F\approx0.179$ at the semi-Dirac phase, and
transits between the sub-Poissonian ($F\approx1/3$) and the Poissonian shot
noise ($F\approx1$) limit at the band inversion and the insulating phase,
respectively. Furthermore, the conductance of $2$D semi-Dirac system converges
to the contrasting limit of $G/G_0 \rightarrow 1/d$ and $G/G_0 \rightarrow0$ at
the band inversion and the insulating phases, respectively. The quantum
tunneling spectra exhibits a peculiar coexistence of massless and massive Dirac
quasiparticles in the band inversion regime, thus providing a versatile sandbox
to study the tunneling behavior of various Dirac quasiparticles. These findings
reveal the rich interplay between band topology and quantum transport

significantly from existing in-situ calibration works which resolve multipaths

framework to investigate the micro-scale mechanisms governing the plastic

size and time-scale while limiting computational effort, typically the concept
of representative volume elements (RVEs) is employed. This approach considers
the microstructure evolution in a volume that is representative of the overall
material behavior. However, in settings with complex thermal and mechanical
loading histories careful consideration of the impact of modeling constraints
in terms of time scale and simulation domain on predicted results is required.
We address the representation of heterogeneous dislocation structure formation
in simulation volumes using the example of residual stress formation during
cool-down of laser powder-bed fusion (LPBF) of AISI 316L stainless steel. This
is achieved by a series of large-scale three-dimensional discrete dislocation

  Educational Blockchain","8 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the development of blockchain technology, more and more attention has
been paid to the intersection of blockchain and education, and various
educational evaluation systems and E-learning systems are developed based on
blockchain technology. Among them, Ethereum smart contract is favored by
developers for its ``event-triggered"" mechanism for building education
intelligent trading systems and intelligent learning platforms. However, due to
the immutability of blockchain, published smart contracts cannot be modified,
so problematic contracts cannot be fixed by modifying the code in the
educational blockchain. In recent years, security incidents due to smart
contract vulnerabilities have caused huge property losses, so the detection of
smart contract vulnerabilities in educational blockchain has become a great
challenge. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a graph neural network
(GNN) based vulnerability detection for smart contracts in educational
blockchains. Firstly, the bytecodes are decompiled to get the opcode. Secondly,
the basic blocks are divided, and the edges between the basic blocks according
to the opcode execution logic are added. Then, the control flow graphs (CFG)
are built. Finally, we designed a GNN-based model for vulnerability detection.
The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective for the
vulnerability detection of smart contracts. Compared with the traditional
approaches, it can get good results with fewer layers of the GCN model, which
shows that the contract bytecode and GCN model are efficient in vulnerability
detection.

rotation gates as the central building block. On the other hand, a
fault-tolerant quantum computer can only implement a discrete set of logical
gates, such as the so-called Clifford+T gates. We show that the energy
minimization of VQE can be performed with such a fault-tolerant discrete
gate-set, where we use the Ross-Selinger algorithm to transpile the continuous
rotation gates to the error-correctable Clifford+T gate-set. We find that there
is no loss of convergence when compared to the one of parameterized circuits if
an adaptive accuracy of the transpilation is used in the VQE optimization.
State preparation with VQE requires only a moderate number of T-gates,
depending on the system size and transpilation accuracy. We demonstrate these
properties on emulators for two prototypical spin models with up to 16 qubits.
This is a promising result for the integration of VQE and more generally
variational algorithms in the emerging fault-tolerant setting, where they can
form building blocks of the general quantum algorithms that will become

reduction technique for a composite Lindblad system consisting of a fast
decaying sub-system coupled to another sub-system with a much slower timescale.
Such a system features an invariant manifold that is close to the slow
sub-system. This invariant manifold is reached subsequent to the decay of the
fast degrees of freedom, after which the slow dynamics follow on it. By
parametrizing invariant manifold, the slow dynamics can be simulated via a
reduced model. To find the evolution of the reduced state, we perform the
asymptotic expansion with respect to the timescale separation. So far, the
second-order expansion has mostly been considered. It has then been revealed
that the second-order expansion of the reduced dynamics is generally given by a
Lindblad equation, which ensures complete positivity of the time evolution. In
this paper, we present two examples where complete positivity of the reduced
dynamics is violated with higher-order contributions. In the first example, the
violation is detected for the evolution of the partial trace without truncation
of the asymptotic expansion. The partial trace is not the only way to
parametrize the slow dynamics. Concerning this non-uniqueness, it was
conjectured in [R. Azouit, F. Chittaro, A. Sarlette, and P. Rouchon, Quantum

complete positivity. With the second example, however, we refute this
conjecture by showing that complete positivity cannot be restored in any choice
of parametrization. We discuss these results in terms of unavoidable
correlations, in the initial states on the invariant slow manifold, between the
fast and the slow degrees of freedom.

Pre-training (VLP) models can bring transferable knowledge to downstream TPS

the corresponding textual representation and breaking the significant modality
alignment learned from large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we explore the
full utilization of textual potential from VLP in TPS tasks. We build on the
proposed VLP-TPS baseline model, which is the first TPS model with both
pre-trained modalities. We propose the Multi-Integrity Description Constraints
(MIDC) to enhance the robustness of the textual modality by incorporating
different components of fine-grained corpus during training. Inspired by the
prompt approach for zero-shot classification with VLP models, we propose the
Dynamic Attribute Prompt (DAP) to provide a unified corpus of fine-grained
attributes as language hints for the image modality. Extensive experiments show
that our proposed TPS framework achieves state-of-the-art performance,
exceeding the previous best method by a margin.

transition temperature of T$_{CDW}$ = 230 K and a critical exponent $\beta$ =
0.28 $\pm$ 0.03. This value is suggestive of a non-conventional critical
behavior for the CDW phase transition in LaPt$_2$Si$_2$, compatible with a
scenario of CDW discommensuration (DC). The DC would be caused by the existence
of two CDWs in this material, propagating separately in the non equivalent

temperatures T$_{CDW-1}$ = 230 K and T$_{CDW-2}$ = 110 K. A strong
$q$-dependence of the electron-phonon coupling has been identified as the
driving mechanism for the CDW transition at T$_{CDW-1}$ = 230 K while a CDW
with 3-dimensional character, and Fermi surface quasi-nesting as a driving
mechanism, is suggested for the transition at T$_{CDW-2}$ = 110 K. Our results

by observers (such observers may include regulators, rights advocacy groups, or
the general public). The observed actions are typically usages of private keys
such as decryptions, and signings. Examples of transparency protocols include
certificate transparency, cryptocurrency, transparent decryption, and
electronic voting. These protocols usually pose a challenge for automatic
verification, because they involve sophisticated data types that have strong
properties, such as Merkle trees, that allow compact proofs of data presence
and tree extension.
  We address this challenge by introducing new features in ProVerif, and a
methodology for using them. With our methodology, it is possible to describe
the data type quite abstractly, using ProVerif axioms, and prove the
correctness of the protocol using those axioms as assumptions. Then, in
separate steps, one can define one or more concrete implementations of the data
type, and again use ProVerif to show that the implementations satisfy the
assumptions that were coded as axioms. This helps make compositional proofs,
splitting the proof burden into several manageable pieces. We illustrate the
methodology and features by providing the first formal verification of the
transparent decryption and certificate transparency protocols with a precise
modelling of the Merkle tree data structure.

been confirmed. Existing adversarial defenses primarily aim at preventing
adversarial examples from attacking DNNs successfully, rather than preventing
their generation. If the generation of adversarial examples is unregulated,
images within reach are no longer secure and pose a threat to non-robust DNNs.
Although gradient obfuscation attempts to address this issue, it has been shown
to be circumventable. Therefore, we propose a novel adversarial defense
mechanism, which is referred to as immune defense and is the example-based
pre-defense. This mechanism applies carefully designed quasi-imperceptible
perturbations to the raw images to prevent the generation of adversarial
examples for the raw images, and thereby protecting both images and DNNs. These
perturbed images are referred to as Immune Examples (IEs). In the white-box
immune defense, we provide a gradient-based and an optimization-based approach,
respectively. Additionally, the more complex black-box immune defense is taken
into consideration. We propose Masked Gradient Sign Descent (MGSD) to reduce
approximation error and stabilize the update to improve the transferability of
IEs and thereby ensure their effectiveness against black-box adversarial
attacks. The experimental results demonstrate that the optimization-based
approach has superior performance and better visual quality in white-box immune
defense. In contrast, the gradient-based approach has stronger transferability
and the proposed MGSD significantly improve the transferability of baselines.

boundaries of high-critical-temperature superconductors, such as cuprates and
iron-based superconductors, is a crucial issue to be solved for future
applications with polycrystalline materials.
  Although the dominant factor of current suppression might arise during
material fabrication and/or processing, investigating it due to an internal
phase change of the pair potential is an important issue in understanding the
threshold of the critical current.
  In this paper, we study the Josephson current on a symmetric [001]-tilt grain
boundary (GB) of a $d$-wave superconductor on a lattice model.
  In addition to the suppression of the maximum Josephson current associated
with the internal phase change of the $d$-wave pair potential which has been
predicted in continuum models, we find a unique phase interference effect due
to folding of the Fermi surface in the lattice model.
  In particular, the resultant maximum Josephson current at low-tilting-angle
regions tends to be suppressed more than that in preexisting theories.
  Because similar suppressions of the critical current at GBs have been
reported in several experimental works, the present model can serve as a guide

an additional excitation mechanism to thermal expansion, while the observed

of the Universe, is still uncertain. Binary interactions play a key role in the
evolution of many massive stars, yet their impact on chemical yields is poorly
understood. Using the MESA stellar evolution code we predict the chemical
yields ejected in wind mass loss and the supernovae of single and
binary-stripped stars. We do this with a large 162 isotope nuclear network at
solar-metallicity. We find that binary-stripped stars are more effective
producers of the elements than single stars, due to their increased mass loss
and an increased chance to eject their envelopes during a supernova. This
increased production by binaries varies across the periodic table, with
Fluorine and Potassium being more significantly produced by binary-stripped
stars than single stars. We find that the C12/C13 could be used as an indicator
of the conservativeness of mass transfer, as C13 is preferentially ejected
during mass transfer while C12 is preferentially ejected during wind mass loss.
We identify a number of gamma-ray emitting radioactive isotopes that may be
used to help constrain progenitor and explosion models of core-collapse
supernovae with next-generation gamma-ray detectors. For single stars we find
V44 and Mn52 are strong probes of the explosion model, while for
binary-stripped stars it is Cr48. Our findings highlight that binary-stripped
stars are not equivalent to two single stars and that detailed stellar
modelling is needed to predict their final nucleosynthetic yields.

systems. Magnetic fields are believed to be essential in the accretion and
ejection processes around single massive protostars. Aims. Our aim is to unveil
the influence of magnetic fields in the formation of multiple massive stars, in
particular on the fragmentation modes and properties of the multiple
protostellar system. Methods. Using RAMSES, we follow the collapse of a massive
pre-stellar core with (non-ideal) radiation-(magneto-)hydrodynamics. We choose
a setup which promotes multiple stellar system formation. Results. In the
purely hydrodynamical models, we always obtain (at least) binary systems. When
more than two stars are present, their gravitational interaction triggers
mergers until there are two stars left. The following gas accretion increases
their orbital separation and hierarchical fragmentation occurs so that both
stars host a comparable disk and stellar system which then form similar disks
as well. We identify several modes of fragmentation: Toomre-unstable disk
fragmentation, arm-arm collision and arm-filament collision. Disks grow in size
until they fragment and become truncated as the newly-formed companion gains
mass. When including magnetic fields, the picture evolves: the primary disk
produces less fragments, arm-filament collision is absent. Magnetic fields
reduce the initial orbital separation but do not affect its further evolution,
which is mainly driven by gas accretion. With magnetic fields, the growth of
individual disks is regulated even in the absence of fragmentation or
truncation. Conclusions. Hierarchical fragmentation is seen in unmagnetized and
magnetized models. Magnetic fields, including non-ideal effects, are important
because they remove certain fragmentation modes and limit the growth of disks,
which is otherwise only limited through fragmentation.

nano-scaled cavities are believed to play a significant role in the failure. In
a recent work, using numerical simulations, we have shown the correspondence
between cavitation under uniform expansion of amorphous solids and the yielding
under shear. In this study, we probe the stability of spatially-homogeneous
states sampled from expansion trajectories to alternate modes of driving, viz.
macroscopic cyclic shear or local random deformation via activity. We find
that, under cyclic shear and activity, the cavitation instabilities can occur
in expanded states at much higher densities than under pure uniform-expansion,
and the shift in density is determined by the magnitude of the secondary
deformation. We also show that barriers to cavitation on the energy landscape
are much smaller for cyclic-shear and activity than seen under expansion.
Further, we also analyse the spatial manifestation of cavitation and
investigate whether large scale irreversible plasticity can set in due to the
combination of expansion and the secondary deformation. Overall, our study
reveals the interplay between expansion and other deformation modes leading to
cavitation instabilities and the existence of abundant relaxation pathways for
such processes.

classical oscillator with varying frequency, the quantum Bloch rotation
exhibits peculiar features that escape from the hybrid description. In
addition, nonlinear corrections to the harmonic Hamiltonian lead to an overall
growth of decoherence at long times, which is absent in the fully quantum

the UK between 2005 and 2020. We then study wage differentials in
gender-specific dominated sectors. We found that the differences in wages and
contractual opportunities result mainly from the propensity of women to be
distributed differently across sectors. Hence, the disproportion of women in
female-dominated sectors implies contractual features and lower wages typical
of that sector, on average, for all workers. This difference is primarily
explained by persistent discriminatory constraints, while human capital-related
characteristics play a minor role. However, wage differentials would shrink if
workers had the same potential wages as men in male-dominated sectors.
Moreover, this does not happen at the top of the wage distribution, where wage
differentials among women in female-dominated sectors are always more
pronounced than men.

strongly decrease the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), without

DMI interaction against interfacial chemical intermixing, already predicted by
theory. In parallel with the decrease of the PMA in the irradiated samples, a
strong decrease of the depinning field is observed. This allows the domain
walls to reach large maximum velocities with lower magnetic fields with respect
to those needed for the pristine films. Decoupling PMA from DMI can therefore
be beneficial for the design of low energy devices based on domain wall

The state-of-the-art approaches transform equality information into inequality

methods, however, encounter the loss of computational efficiency due to the
difficulty in finding the maximum of the likelihood function, the large
coefficient of variation (COV) associated with the posterior failure
probability and the inapplicability to dynamic updating problems where new

proposes an innovative method called RU-SAIS (reliability updating using
sequential adaptive importance sampling), which combines elements of sequential
importance sampling and K-means clustering to construct a series of important
sampling densities (ISDs) using Gaussian mixture. The last ISD of the sequence
is further adaptively modified through application of the cross entropy method.
The performance of RU-SAIS is demonstrated by three examples. Results show that
RU-SAIS achieves a more accurate and robust estimator of the posterior failure

a new type of spin splitting besides the well-studied Zeeman, Rashba and
Dresselhaus effects, enabling giant and momentum dependent spin polarization of
energy bands on selected antiferromagnets independent of relativistic
spin-orbit interaction. Despite the ever-growing theoretical predictions, the
direct spectroscopic proof of such spin splitting is still lacking. Here, we

such materials. In the noncoplanar antiferromagnet MnTe$_2$, the in-plane
components of spin are found to be antisymmetric about the high-symmetry planes
of the Brillouin zone, comprising a plaid-like spin texture in the
antiferromagnetic ground state. Such an unconventional spin pattern, further
found to diminish at the high-temperature paramagnetic state, stems from the
intrinsic antiferromagnetic order instead of the relativistic spin-orbit
coupling. Our finding demonstrates a new type of spin-momentum locking with a
nonrelativistic origin, placing antiferromagnetic spintronics on a firm basis

Extreme precision radial velocity (RV) surveys seeking to detect
planets at RV semi-amplitudes of 10 cm/s are facing numerous challenges. One of
those challenges is convective blueshift caused by stellar granulation and its
suppression through magnetic activity which plays a significant role in hiding
planetary signals in stellar jitter. Aims. Previously we found that for main
sequence stars, convective blueshift as an observational proxy for the strength
of convection near the stellar surface strongly depends on effective
temperature. In this work we investigate 242 post main sequence stars, covering
the subgiant, red giant, and asymptotic giant phases and empirically determine
the changes in convective blueshift with advancing stellar evolution. Methods.
We used the third signature scaling approach to fit a solar model for the
convective blueshift to absorption-line shift measurements from a sample of
coadded HARPS spectra, ranging in temperature from 3750 K to 6150 K. We compare
the results to main sequence stars of comparable temperatures but with a higher
surface gravity. Results. We show that convective blueshift becomes
significantly stronger for evolved stars compared to main sequence stars of a
similar temperature. The difference increases as the star becomes more evolved,
reaching a 5x increase below 4300 K for the most evolved stars. The large
number of stars in the sample, for the first time, allowed for us to
empirically show that convective blueshift remains almost constant among the
entire evolved star sample at roughly solar convection strength with a slight
increase from the red giant phase onward. We discover that the convective
blueshift shows a local minimum for subgiant stars, presenting a sweet spot for
exoplanet searches around higher mass stars, by taking advantage of their
spin-down during the subgiant transition.

quantities such as parity or particle number, place constraints on the physical
state space of fermionic mode systems. This affects the amount of extractable
mode entanglement possessed in a given state and its manipulation by the
so-called entanglement-free operations. Here, we present a set of
majorization-based conditions for the mixed state transformations of bipartite
mode entanglement, where the allowed operations (i.e., resource non-generating
operations), that is, local operations and classical communication, are
restricted by local SSRs. We then focus on the local parity SSR and investigate
the possibility to relax the constraints imposed by it through a catalyst. In
particular, we show that an ancillary mode system can catalyze the change in
local parity. Finally, we discuss the application of our methodology to various
problems in different fields. Accordingly, we propose that it may shed new
light on the activation of orbital entanglement in chemical molecules and the
manipulation of multipartite entanglement or quantum discord in distinguishable
quantum systems.

provides an opportunity for small groups/companies/universities, and
individuals to jointly solve huge-scale problems. However, standard
optimization algorithms are fragile in such settings due to the possible
presence of so-called Byzantine workers -- participants that can send
(intentionally or not) incorrect information instead of the one prescribed by
the protocol (e.g., send anti-gradient instead of stochastic gradients). Thus,
the problem of designing distributed methods with provable robustness to
Byzantine workers has been receiving a lot of attention recently. In
particular, several works consider a very promising way to achieve Byzantine
tolerance via exploiting variance reduction and robust aggregation. The
existing approaches use SAGA- and SARAH-type variance-reduced estimators, while
another popular estimator -- SVRG -- is not studied in the context of
Byzantine-robustness. In this work, we close this gap in the literature and
propose a new method -- Byzantine-Robust Loopless Stochastic Variance Reduced
Gradient (BR-LSVRG). We derive non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for the
new method in the strongly convex case and compare its performance with
existing approaches in numerical experiments.

of exercise performance associated with neuromuscular fatigue. The aim of the
present study was to understand the role of the metabolic cost of exercise in
determining exercise tolerance, CT and W' and the mechanisms of neuromuscular
fatigue.Methods: Twelve subjects performed four knee extension time-trials (6,
8, 10, and 12-minutes) using eccentric, isometric, or concentric contractions
(3 s-on/2 s-off at 90{\textdegree} or 30{\textdegree}/s) to modulate the
metabolic cost of exercise. Exercise performance was quantified by total
impulse and mean torque. CT and W' were determined using the linear
relationship between total impulse and contraction time. Cardiometabolic,
neuromuscular, and ventilatory responses were quantified. Neuromuscular
function was evaluated by maximal voluntary contraction, resting potentiated
single/doublet electrical stimulations, and superimposed single electrical
stimulation to quantify neuromuscular, peripheral, and central fatigue,
respectively.Results: Compared to isometric exercise, total impulse (+36 $\pm$
21%; P < 0.001), CT (+27 $\pm$ 30%; P < 0.001), and W' (+67 $\pm$ 99%; P <
0.001) were increased during eccentric exercise whereas total impulse (-25
$\pm$ 7%; P < 0.001), critical torque (-26 $\pm$ 15%; P < 0.001) and W' (-18
$\pm$ 19%; P < 0.001) were reduced in concentric exercise. Conversely, the
metabolic response and the degree of peripheral fatigue were reduced during
eccentric exercise whereas they were increased during concentric exercise. CT
was negatively associated with oxygen consumption gain (R2 = 0.636; P < 0.001)
and W' was negatively associated with rates of neuromuscular and peripheral
fatigue indices (R2 = [0.252-0.880]; P < 0.001).Conclusions: The contraction
mode influenced both CT and W', and consequently exercise tolerance, indicating
that the metabolic cost of contraction played a key role.

poses from images or video frames. When HPE models estimate hand poses captured
in a laboratory or under controlled environments, they normally deliver good
performance. However, the real-world environment is complex, and various
uncertainties may happen, which could degrade the performance of HPE models.
For example, the hands could be occluded, the visibility of hands could be
reduced by imperfect exposure rate, and the contour of hands prone to be
blurred during fast hand movements. In this work, we adopt metamorphic testing
to evaluate the robustness of HPE models and provide suggestions on the choice
of HPE models for different applications. The robustness evaluation was
conducted on four state-of-the-art models, namely MediaPipe hands, OpenPose,
BodyHands, and NSRM hand. We found that on average more than 80\% of the hands
could not be identified by BodyHands, and at least 50\% of hands could not be
identified by MediaPipe hands when diagonal motion blur is introduced, while an
average of more than 50\% of strongly underexposed hands could not be correctly
estimated by NSRM hand. Similarly, applying occlusions on only four hand joints
will also largely degrade the performance of these models. The experimental
results show that occlusions, illumination variations, and motion blur are the
main obstacles to the performance of existing HPE models. These findings may
pave the way for researchers to improve the performance and robustness of hand

[OIII]$\lambda$5007/[OII]$\lambda$3727 ratios ($O_{32}$) and steep UV continuum
slopes ( $\beta$ ) are consistent with the values observed for low redshift
Lyman continuum emitters, suggesting that such galaxies contribute to the
ionizing budget of the intergalactic medium. We construct a logistic regression
model to estimate the probability of a galaxy being a Lyman continuum emitter
based on the measured $M_{UV}$, $\beta$, and $O_{32}$ values. Using this
probability together with the UV luminosity function, we construct an empirical
model that estimates the contribution of high redshift galaxies to reionization

average escape fraction of the galaxy population (i.e., including both LyC
emitters and non-emitters) varies with $M_{UV}$, with brighter galaxies having
larger $f_{esc}$. For $M_{UV}$ $< -$19 we find an average escape fraction of
20$\%$, decreasing to almost zero for $M_{UV}$$>-16$. Galaxies with
intermediate UV luminosity ($-19 <$ $M_{UV}$ $< -16$) contribute half of the
ionizing photons. The relative contribution of faint versus bright galaxies

affect an organisation's competitiveness and performance. Explaining the
reasons why employees leave an organisation is a key human resource management
challenge due to the high costs and time required to attract and keep talented
employees. Businesses therefore aim to increase employee retention rates to
minimise their costs and maximise their performance. Machine learning (ML) has
been applied in various aspects of human resource management including
attrition prediction to provide businesses with insights on proactive measures
on how to prevent talented employees from quitting. Among these ML methods, the
best performance has been reported by ensemble or deep neural networks, which
by nature constitute black box techniques and thus cannot be easily
interpreted. To enable the understanding of these models' reasoning several
explainability frameworks have been proposed. Counterfactual explanation
methods have attracted considerable attention in recent years since they can be
used to explain and recommend actions to be performed to obtain the desired
outcome. However current counterfactual explanations methods focus on
optimising the changes to be made on individual cases to achieve the desired
outcome. In the attrition problem it is important to be able to foresee what
would be the effect of an organisation's action to a group of employees where
the goal is to prevent them from leaving the company. Therefore, in this paper
we propose the use of counterfactual explanations focusing on multiple
attrition cases from historical data, to identify the optimum interventions
that an organisation needs to make to its practices/policies to prevent or

their unconventional wave phenomena and strengthened nonlinear response.
However, the technological impact of ENZ media will be determined by the
quality of realistic ENZ materials, including material loss and surface
roughness. Here, we provide a comprehensive experimental study of the impact of
surface roughness on ENZ substrates. Using silicon carbide (SiC) substrates
with artificially induced roughness, we analyze samples whose roughness ranges
from a few to hundreds of nanometer size-scales. It is concluded that ENZ
substrates with roughness in the few nanometer scale are negatively affected by
coupling to longitudinal phonons and strong ENZ fields normal to the surface.
On the other hand, when the roughness is in the hundreds of nanometer scale,
the ENZ band is found to be more robust than dielectric and surface phonon
polariton (SPhP) bands.

inter-particle interaction plays a crucial role in collective quantum
phenomena, quantum phase transitions, and quantum information processing. It
can profoundly alter the band structure of quantum many-body systems and give
rise to exotic topological phenomena. Conventional topological pumping, which
has been well demonstrated in driven linear or noninteracting systems, may
break down in the presence of strong interaction. However, the interplay
between band topology and interaction could also induce emergent topological
pumping of interacting particles, but its experimental realization has proven
challenging. Here we demonstrate interaction-induced topological pumping in a
solid-state quantum system comprising an array of 36 superconducting qubits.
With strong interaction inherent in the qubits and site-resolved
controllability of the lattice potential and hopping strength, we realize the
topological Thouless pumping of single and two bounded particles. Beyond these
topological phenomena with linear or noninteracting counterparts, we also
observe topologically resonant tunneling and asymmetric edge-state transport of
interacting particles. Our work creates a paradigm for multi-particle
topological effects, and provides a new pathway to the study of exotic
topological phenomena, many-body quantum transport, and quantum information
transfer.

produced during inflation cause a strong backreaction on the background
evolution and its impact on the spectrum and the correlation length of gauge
fields. With this aim, the gradient-expansion formalism previously proposed for
the description of inflationary magnetogenesis in purely kinetic or purely
axial coupling models, is extended to the case when both types of coupling are
present. As it is formulated in position space, this method allows us to
self-consistently take into account the backreaction of generated gauge fields
on the inflationary background because it captures the nonlinear evolution of
all physically relevant gauge-field modes at once. Using this extended
gradient-expansion formalism, suitable for a wide range of inflationary
magnetogenesis models, we study the gauge-field production in a specific
generalization of the Starobinsky $R^2$-model with a nonminimal coupling of
gauge fields to gravity. In the Einstein frame, this model implies, in addition
to an asymptotically flat inflaton potential, also a nontrivial form of kinetic
and axial coupling functions which decrease in time and, thus, are potentially
suitable for the generation of gauge fields with a scale-invariant or even
red-tilted power spectrum. The numerical analysis shows, however, that
backreaction, which unavoidably occurs in this model for the interesting range
of parameters, strongly alters the behavior of the spectrum and does not allow
to obtain a sufficiently large correlation length for the magnetic field. The
oscillatory behavior of the generated field, caused by the retarded response of
the gauge field to changes of the inflaton velocity, was revealed.

segmentation. However, due to its limited receptive field, FCN cannot
effectively capture global context information which is vital for semantic
segmentation. As a result, it is beaten by state-of-the-art methods which
leverage different filter sizes for larger receptive fields. However, such a
strategy usually introduces more parameters and increases the computational
cost. In this paper, we propose a novel global receptive convolution (GRC) to
effectively increase the receptive field of FCN for context information
extraction, which results in an improved FCN termed FCN+. The GRC provides
global receptive field for convolution without introducing any extra learnable
parameters. The motivation of GRC is that different channels of a convolutional
filter can have different grid sampling locations across the whole input
feature map. Specifically, the GRC first divides the channels of the filter
into two groups. The grid sampling locations of the first group are shifted to
different spatial coordinates across the whole feature map, according to their
channel indexes. This can help the convolutional filter capture the global
context information. The grid sampling location of the second group remains
unchanged to keep the original location information. Convolving using these two
groups, the GRC can integrate the global context into the original location
information of each pixel for better dense prediction results. With the GRC
built in, FCN+ can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods
for semantic segmentation tasks, as verified on PASCAL VOC 2012, Cityscapes,

(DCE-CT) is crucial for diagnosis and image-guided surgical planning of liver
cancer. However, intensity variations due to the flow of contrast agents
combined with complex spatial motion induced by respiration brings great
challenge to existing intensity-based registration methods. To address these
problems, we propose a novel structure-aware registration method by
incorporating structural information of related organs with segmentation-guided
deep registration network. Existing segmentation-guided registration methods
only focus on volumetric registration inside the paired organ segmentations,
ignoring the inherent attributes of their anatomical structures. In addition,
such paired organ segmentations are not always available in DCE-CT images due
to the flow of contrast agents. Different from existing segmentation-guided
registration methods, our proposed method extracts structural information in
hierarchical geometric perspectives of line and surface. Then, according to the
extracted structural information, structure-aware constraints are constructed
and imposed on the forward and backward deformation field simultaneously. In
this way, all available organ segmentations, including unpaired ones, can be
fully utilized to avoid the side effect of contrast agent and preserve the
topology of organs during registration. Extensive experiments on an in-house
liver DCE-CT dataset and a public LiTS dataset show that our proposed method
can achieve higher registration accuracy and preserve anatomical structure more
effectively than state-of-the-art methods.

simpler, more versatile and less computationally intensive. The score is also
easily interpretable and consistent with real life hesitations of pathologists.
We show that the score is capable of accurately identifying mispredicted slides
and that accuracy for high confidence decisions is significantly higher than
for low-confidence decisions (gap in AUC of 17.1% on the test set). We believe
that the proposed confidence score could be leveraged by pathologists directly
in their workflow and assist them on difficult tasks such as grading
precancerous lesions.

radiotherapy-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs). A suitable therapeutic avenue
in these cases may involve the use of a differentiating agent (DA) to force the
differentiation of the CSCs and of conventional therapies to eliminate the
remaining differentiated cancer cells (DCCs). To describe the effects of a DA
that reprograms CSCs into DCCs, we adapt a differential equation model
developed to investigate tumorspheres, which are assumed to consist of jointly
evolving CSC and DCC populations. We analyze the mathematical properties of the
model, finding the equilibria and their stability. We also present numerical
solutions and phase diagrams to describe the system evolution and the therapy
effects, denoting the DA strength by a parameter \(a_{dif}\).To obtain
realistic predictions, we choose the other model parameters to be those
determined previously from fits to various experimental datasets. These
datasets characterize the progression of the tumor under various culture
conditions. Typically, for small values of \(a_{dif}\) the tumor evolves
towards a final state that contains a CSC fraction, but a strong therapy leads
to the suppression of this phenotype. Nonetheless, different external
conditions lead to very diverse behaviors. For some environmental conditions,
the model predicts a threshold not only in the therapy strength, but also in
its starting time, an early beginning being potentially crucial. In summary,
our model shows how the effects of a DA depend critically not only on the
dosage and timing of the drug application, but also on the tumor nature and its
environment.

We recall the link with the perturbative second order time convolution

characterizing non-Markovian dynamics such as the non- Markovianity measures or
the dynamical map are also briefly discussed in the context of HEOM
simulations. The main points of the tensor-train expansion are illustrated in
an example with a qubit interacting with a bath described by a Lorentzian
spectral density. Finally, we give three illustrative applications in which the
system-bath coupling operator is similar to that of the analytical treatment.
The first example revisits a model in which population-to-coherence transfer
via the bath creates a long-lasting coherence between two states. The second
one is devoted to the computation of stationary absorption and emission
spectra. We illustrate the link between the spectral density and the Stokes
shift in situations with and without nonadiabatic interaction. Finally, we
simulate an excitation transfer when the spectral density is discretized by
undamped modes to illustrate a situation in which the TT formulation is more

differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), struggles with
training moderately-sized neural network models for a value of epsilon
corresponding to a high level of privacy protection. In this paper, we explore
the idea of dimensionality reduction inspired by neural network pruning to
improve the scalability of DP-SGD. We study the interplay between neural
network pruning and differential privacy, through the two modes of parameter
updates. We call the first mode, parameter freezing, where we pre-prune the
network and only update the remaining parameters using DP-SGD. We call the
second mode, parameter selection, where we select which parameters to update at
each step of training and update only those selected using DP-SGD. In these
modes, we use public data for freezing or selecting parameters to avoid privacy
loss incurring in these steps. Naturally, the closeness between the private and
public data plays an important role in the success of this paradigm. Our
experimental results demonstrate how decreasing the parameter space improves
differentially private training. Moreover, by studying two popular forms of
pruning which do not rely on gradients and do not incur an additional privacy
loss, we show that random selection performs on par with magnitude-based
selection when it comes to DP-SGD training.

the $G$-DNNs are not required to be $G$-equivariant; instead, the
preactivations are constrained to be $G$-equivariant functions of the network
input in a way that couples weights across all layers. The result is a richer
family of $G$-invariant architectures never seen previously. We derive an
efficient implementation of $G$-DNNs after a reparameterization of weights, as
well as necessary and sufficient conditions for an architecture to be
""admissible"" -- i.e., nondegenerate and inequivalent to smaller architectures.
We include code that allows a user to build a $G$-DNN interactively
layer-by-layer, with the final architecture guaranteed to be admissible.
Finally, we apply $G$-DNNs to two example problems -- (1) multiplication in
$\{-1, 1\}$ (with theoretical guarantees) and (2) 3D object classification --

performance compared to baselines with only ordinary (i.e., unsigned)

sensitivity to SCC. Here, we study at the nanometer scale the evolution of the
microstructure near stress corrosion cracks on two different model variants of
the 7140 aluminum alloy. We performed double cantilever beam (DCB) crack growth
tests in hot (70{\deg}C) humid air, on samples extracted at quarter-thickness

sensitive T6 condition. The sample at T/4 shows a lower KISCC along with
flatter grains and a higher solute content, whereas both samples exhibit
similar crack growth rates at higher stress intensities. We report on
precipitate dissolution and matrix solute enrichment near the crack tips, with
the T/4 position presenting the higher increase in solute levels. The near

precipitate dissolution and transport of solutes towards the stress-corrosion
crack tip. These results agree with a recent report on another 7xxx Al-alloy

different tile files N is too large, the current cooperative caching algorithms
do not cope with such large-scale input data. We further analyze the problem

droplet evaporation is always homogeneous in the bulk of the cloud, while being
inhomogeneous in view to the relaxation of the supersaturation field. The

Besides, the integration of static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) in a

However, it is still challenging to understand the impact mechanism of STATCOMs
on IBR-induced oscillation issues and to design STATCOMs' control for damping
these oscillation issues in a multi-IBR system, due to complex system dynamics

proposes a novel method to reveal how STATCOMs influence IBR-induced

we find critical operating conditions, wherein the system tends to be most
unstable; moreover, we demonstrate that robust small-signal stability issues of

subsystems under critical operating conditions, which avoids traversing all

an adaptive control-parameter design method is proposed for STATCOMs to ensure

efficacy of proposed methods is validated by a 39-node test system.

flying speed and data offloading constraints. We exploit the Bernstein-type
inequality to reformulate the constraints in deterministic forms and decompose
the energy minimization to solve for trajectory and offloading separately
within an alternating optimization framework. The subproblems are then tackled
with the successive convex approximation technique. Simulation results show
that our proposal strictly guarantees robustness under uncertainties and

with giant coercivity and spin-valve characteristics using a combined
experimental and theoretical study. The alloy crystallizes in an inverse
Heusler structure (without any martensitic transition) with a para- to

coercive field of about 8.5 kOe (at 2 K). The negative temperature coefficient,
relatively low magnitude and weak temperture dependance of electrical
resistivity suggest the semimetallic character of the alloy. This is further
supported by our specific heat measurement. Magnetoresistance (MR) confirms an
irreversible nature (with its magnitude $\sim$1\%) along with a change of sign
across the magnetic transition indicating the potentiality of Mn$_2$IrGa in
magnetic switching applications. In addition, asymmetric nature of MR in the

to find the planets migrating outwards and locked in the 3:2 mean motion
resonance (MMR). These results were obtained in the framework of viscously
accreting discs, in which the observed stellar accretion rates constrained the
viscosity values. However, it has recently been shown observationally and
theoretically that discs are probably less viscous than previously thought.
Therefore, in this paper, we explore the dynamics of pairs of giant planets in
low-viscosity discs. We performed two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations
using the grid-based code FARGOCA. In contrast to classical viscous discs, we
find that the outer planet never crosses the 2:1 resonance and the pair does
not migrate outwards. After a wide parameter exploration, including the mass of
the outer planet, we find that the planets are primarily locked in the 2:1 MMR
and in some cases in the 5:2 MMR. We explain semi-analytically why it is not
possible for the outer planet to cross the 2:1 MMR in a low-viscosity disc. We
find that pairs of giant planets migrate inwards in low-viscosity discs.
Although, in some cases, having a pair of giant planets can slow down the
migration speed with respect to a single planet. Such pairs of slowly migrating
planets may be located, at the end of the disc phase, in the population of
exoplanets of 'warm Jupiters'. However, the planets never migrate outwards.
These results could have strong implications on the Solar System's formation
scenarios if the Sun's protoplanetary disc had a low viscosity.

two publicly-available, real-world datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness at
global localization in both non-urban and urban environments. The Katwijk Beach

a wide dynamic range. This enables capturing visual information at fine time
granularities (e.g., microseconds) in rapidly changing environments. This makes
event cameras highly useful for high-speed robotics tasks involving rapid
motion, such as high-speed perception, object tracking, and control. However,
convolutional neural network inference on event camera streams cannot currently
perform real-time inference at the high speeds at which event cameras operate -
current CNN inference times are typically closer in order of magnitude to the
frame rates of regular frame-based cameras. Real-time inference at event camera
rates is necessary to fully leverage the high frequency and high temporal
resolution that event cameras offer. This paper presents EvConv, a new approach
to enable fast inference on CNNs for inputs from event cameras. We observe that
consecutive inputs to the CNN from an event camera have only small differences
between them. Thus, we propose to perform inference on the difference between
consecutive input tensors, or the increment. This enables a significant
reduction in the number of floating-point operations required (and thus the
inference latency) because increments are very sparse. We design EvConv to
leverage the irregular sparsity in increments from event cameras and to retain
the sparsity of these increments across all layers of the network. We
demonstrate a reduction in the number of floating operations required in the
forward pass by up to 98%. We also demonstrate a speedup of up to 1.6X for
inference using CNNs for tasks such as depth estimation, object recognition,

phonon modes. In this work, we demonstrate ground state operation of a
Brillouin optomechanical system composed of a quartz BAW resonator inside an
optical cavity. The system is operated at $\sim$200 mK temperatures inside a
dilution refrigerator, which is made possible by designing the system so that
it self-aligns during cooldown and is relatively insensitive to mechanical
vibrations. We show optomechanical coupling to several phonon modes and perform
sideband asymmetry thermometry to demonstrate a thermal occupation below 0.5
phonons at base temperature. This constitutes the heaviest ($\sim$494 $\mu$g)
mechanical object measured in the quantum ground state to date. Further
measurements confirm a negligible effect of laser heating on this phonon
occupation. Our results pave the way toward low-noise, high-efficiency
microwave-to-optical transduction based on BAW resonators.

Accordingly, we present a complete recommender system for movie

First, it is trained using federated learning and thus is, by its very nature,
privacy-preserving, while still enabling individual users to benefit from
global insights. And second, a novel federated learning scheme, FedQ, is
employed, which not only addresses the problem of non-i.i.d. and small local

client models early. To reduce the communication overhead, compression is
applied, which significantly reduces the exchanged neural network updates to a
fraction of their original data. We conjecture that it may also improve data

various corresponding formulations for $R_0$, have been proposed in the
literature. However, little attention has been paid to the impact of the
distribution of the population size within social structures, effect that can
help plan effective interventions. We focus on the influence on the model
outcomes of teleworking strategies, consisting in reshaping the distribution of
workplace sizes. We consider a stochastic \emph{SIR} model with two levels of
mixing, accounting for a uniformly mixing general population, each individual
belonging also to a household and a workplace. The variance of the workplace
size distribution appears to be a good proxy for the impact of this
distribution on key outcomes of the epidemic, such as epidemic size and peak.
In particular, our findings suggest that strategies where the proportion of
individuals teleworking depends sublinearly on the size of the workplace
outperform the strategy with linear dependence. Besides, one drawback of the
model with multiple levels of mixing is its complexity, raising interest in a
reduced model. We propose an unstructured \emph{SIR} ODE-based model,
explicitly exhibiting social structure sizes. This reduced model, sharing the
same growth rate as the initial model, yields a generally satisfying
approximation of the epidemic. These results, robust to various changes in
model structure, are very promising from the perspective of implementing
effective strategies based on social distancing of specific contacts.
Furthermore, they contribute to the effort of building relevant approximations
of individual based models at intermediate scales.

consists of a set of engineered prompts applied to a conversational LLM that
both identify sentences with data, extract data, and assure its correctness
through a series of follow-up questions. These follow-up questions address a
critical challenge associated with LLMs - their tendency to provide factually
inaccurate responses. ChatExtract can be applied with any conversational LLMs
and yields very high quality data extraction. In tests on materials data we
find precision and recall both over 90% from the best conversational LLMs,
likely rivaling or exceeding human accuracy in many cases. We demonstrate that
the exceptional performance is enabled by the information retention in a
conversational model combined with purposeful redundancy and introducing
uncertainty through follow-up prompts. These results suggest that approaches
similar to ChatExtract, due to their simplicity, transferability and accuracy
are likely to replace other methods of data extraction in the near future.

utilizing SOAP provides another 19.33% relative improvement. As a result, our

systems to satisfy a given specification is to obtain a finite-state
abstraction of the original systems. The complexity of the abstraction is
usually the dominating factor that determines the efficiency of the algorithm.
For the control synthesis of discrete-time nonlinear stochastic systems
modelled by nonlinear stochastic difference equations, recent literature has
demonstrated the soundness of abstractions in preserving robust probabilistic
satisfaction of {\omega}-regular lineartime properties. However, unnecessary
transitions exist within the abstractions, which are difficult to quantify, and
the completeness of abstraction-based control synthesis in the stochastic
setting remains an open theoretical question. In this paper, we address this
fundamental question from the topological view of metrizable space of
probability measures, and propose constructive finite-state abstractions for
control synthesis of probabilistic linear temporal specifications. Such
abstractions are both sound and approximately complete. That is, given a
concrete discrete-time stochastic system and an arbitrarily small
L1-perturbation of this system, there exists a family of finite-state
controlled Markov chains that both abstracts the concrete system and is
abstracted by the slightly perturbed system. In other words, given an
arbitrarily small prescribed precision, an abstraction always exists to decide
whether a control strategy exists for the concrete system to satisfy the
probabilistic specification.

our solution addressed the identified needs and abilities of this heterogeneous

to perform deliberately designed experiments and record brain activity
simultaneously, aiming to understand the brain mechanism underlying cognition.
However, how the results of this protocol can be applied in technology is
seldom discussed. Here, I review the studies on time processing of the brain as
examples of this protocol, as well as two main application areas of
neuroscience (neuroengineering and brain-inspired artificial intelligence).
Time processing is an indispensable dimension of cognition; time is also an
indispensable dimension of any real-world signal to be processed in technology.
So one may expect that the studies of time processing in cognition profoundly
influence brain-related technology. Surprisingly, I found that the results from
cognitive studies on timing processing are hardly helpful in solving practical
problems. This awkward situation may be due to the lack of generalizability of
the results of cognitive studies, which are under well-controlled laboratory
conditions, to real-life situations. This lack of generalizability may be
rooted in the fundamental unknowability of the world (including cognition).
Overall, this paper questions and criticizes the usefulness and prospect of the
above-mentioned research protocol of cognitive neuroscience. I then give three
suggestions for future research. First, to improve the generalizability of
research, it is better to study brain activity under real-life conditions
instead of in well-controlled laboratory experiments. Second, to overcome the
unknowability of the world, we can engineer an easily accessible surrogate of
the object under investigation, so that we can predict the behavior of the
object by experimenting on the surrogate. Third, I call for technology-oriented
research, with the aim of technology creation instead of knowledge discovery.

Reynolds-averaged NavierStokes (RANS) simulations play a significant part in
contributing to the uncertainty of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
Perturbing the spectral representation of the Reynolds stress tensor within
physical limits is common practice in several commercial and open-source CFD
solvers, in order to obtain estimates for the epistemic uncertainties of RANS
turbulence models. Recent research revealed, that there is a need for
moderating the amount of perturbed Reynolds stress tensor tensor to be
considered due to upcoming stability issues of the solver. In this paper we
point out that the consequent common implementation can lead to unintended
states of the resulting perturbed Reynolds stress tensor. The combination of
eigenvector perturbation and moderation factor may actually result in moderated
eigenvalues, which are not linearly dependent on the originally unperturbed and
fully perturbed eigenvalues anymore. Hence, the computational implementation is
no longer in accordance with the conceptual idea of the Eigenspace Perturbation
Framework. We verify the implementation of the conceptual description with
respect to its self-consistency. Adequately representing the basic concept
results in formulating a computational implementation to improve
self-consistency of the Reynolds stress tensor perturbation

Recently, with the development of geometric neural networks, the data-driven
schemes have been successfully applied in this field, both for molecular
conformation generation (in vacuum) and binding pose generation (in protein
pocket). The former beats the traditional ETKDG method, while the latter
achieves similar accuracy compared with the widely used molecular docking
software. Although these methods have shown promising results, some researchers
have recently questioned whether deep learning (DL) methods perform better in
molecular conformation generation via a parameter-free method. To our surprise,
what they have designed is some kind analogous to the famous infinite monkey
theorem, the monkeys that are even equipped with physics education. To discuss
the feasibility of their proving, we constructed a real infinite stochastic
monkey for molecular conformation generation, showing that even with a more
stochastic sampler for geometry generation, the coverage of the benchmark
QM-computed conformations are higher than those of most DL-based methods. By
extending their physical monkey algorithm for binding pose prediction, we also
discover that the successful docking rate also achieves near-best performance
among existing DL-based docking models. Thus, though their conclusions are
right, their proof process needs more concern.

the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory to
detect interstellar objects of small sizes during its period of operation over
the next decade. We use LSST's detection capabilities and simulate populations
of interstellar objects in the range of 1-50m in diameter to calculate the
expected number of small interstellar objects that will be detected. We use
previous detections of interstellar objects to calibrate our object density
estimates. We also consider the impact of the population's albedo on detection
rates by considering populations with two separate albedo distributions: a
constant albedo of 0.06 and an albedo distribution that resembles near earth
asteroids. We find that the number of detections increases with the diameter
over the range of diameters we consider. We estimate a detection rate of up to
a small ISO every two years of LSST's operation with an increase by a factor of
ten for future surveys that extend a magnitude deeper.

a crucial role on social media platforms. Based on existing efforts, this work
has two observations: (1) For different annotators, labeling highlight has
uncertainty, which leads to inaccurate and time-consuming annotations. (2)
Besides previous supervised or unsupervised settings, some existing video
corpora can be useful, e.g., trailers, but they are often noisy and incomplete
to cover the full highlights. In this work, we study a more practical and
promising setting, i.e., reformulating highlight detection as ""learning with
noisy labels"". This setting does not require time-consuming manual annotations
and can fully utilize existing abundant video corpora. First, based on movie
trailers, we leverage scene segmentation to obtain complete shots, which are
regarded as noisy labels. Then, we propose a Collaborative noisy Label Cleaner
(CLC) framework to learn from noisy highlight moments. CLC consists of two
modules: augmented cross-propagation (ACP) and multi-modality cleaning (MMC).
The former aims to exploit the closely related audio-visual signals and fuse
them to learn unified multi-modal representations. The latter aims to achieve
cleaner highlight labels by observing the changes in losses among different
modalities. To verify the effectiveness of CLC, we further collect a
large-scale highlight dataset named MovieLights. Comprehensive experiments on
MovieLights and YouTube Highlights datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach. Code has been made available at:

where the representations are learned using a supervised contrastive loss.
Class prototypes are evolved continually in the same latent space, enabling
learning and prediction at any point. To continually adapt the prototypes
without keeping any prior task data, we propose a novel distillation loss that
constrains class prototypes to maintain relative similarities as compared to
new task data. This method yields state-of-the-art performance in the
task-incremental setting, outperforming methods relying on large amounts of

attention. While recent PETL methods showcase impressive performance, they rely
on optimistic assumptions: 1) the entire parameter set of a PTM is available,

However, in most real-world applications, PTMs are served as a black-box API or

two components; 1) Coordinator and 2) simultaneous perturbation stochastic
approximation with gradient correction (SPSA-GC). The Coordinator designs
input-dependent image-shaped visual prompts, which improves few-shot adaptation

the gradient of a target model to update Coordinator. Extensive experiments on

testing and optimizer tuning, require a large query load as data. However, it
is often difficult to obtain a large number of real queries from users due to
user privacy restrictions or low frequency of database access. Query generation
is one of the approaches to solve this problem. Existing query generation
methods, such as random generation and template-based generation, do not
consider the relationship between the generated queries and existing queries,
or even generate semantically incorrect queries. In this paper, we propose a
query generation framework based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) to
generate query load that is similar to the given query load. In our framework,
we use a syntax parser to transform the query into a parse tree and traverse
the tree to obtain the sequence of production rules corresponding to the query.
The generator of GAN takes a fixed distribution prior as input and outputs the
query sequence, and the discriminator takes the real query and the fake query
generated by the generator as input and outputs a gradient to guide the
generator learning. In addition, we add context-free grammar and semantic rules
to the generation process, which ensures that the generated queries are
syntactically and semantically correct. We conduct experiments to evaluate our
approach on real-world dataset, which show that our approach can generate new
query loads with a similar distribution to a given query load, and that the
generated queries are syntactically correct with no semantic errors. The
generated query loads are used in downstream task, and the results show a
significant improvement in the models trained with the expanded query loads

to fuse the two modalities, or use self-attention and cross-attention to model
both modality-specific and modality-sharing information. However, the
significant appearance gap between modalities limits the feature representation
ability of certain modalities during the fusion process. To address this
problem, we propose a novel Progressive Fusion Transformer called ProFormer,
which progressively integrates single-modality information into the multimodal
representation for robust RGBT tracking. In particular, ProFormer first uses a
self-attention module to collaboratively extract the multimodal representation,
and then uses two cross-attention modules to interact it with the features of
the dual modalities respectively. In this way, the modality-specific
information can well be activated in the multimodal representation. Finally, a
feed-forward network is used to fuse two interacted multimodal representations
for the further enhancement of the final multimodal representation. In
addition, existing learning methods of RGBT trackers either fuse multimodal
features into one for final classification, or exploit the relationship between
unimodal branches and fused branch through a competitive learning strategy.
However, they either ignore the learning of single-modality branches or result
in one branch failing to be well optimized. To solve these problems, we propose
a dynamically guided learning algorithm that adaptively uses well-performing
branches to guide the learning of other branches, for enhancing the
representation ability of each branch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our proposed ProFormer sets a new state-of-the-art performance on RGBT210,

Nonetheless, realistic driver models are prerequisites for valid simulation

assessment. However, no comparison or discussion of driver models is available

Cordoni et.al. 2022a, Cordoni et.al. 2022b. In this new spatial formulation,
radiation-induced DNA damage in the cell nucleus can undergo different pathways

to rigorously define a spatial model that considers the pairwise interaction of
lesions and continuous protracted irradiation. The former is relevant from a
biological point of view as clustered lesions are less likely to be repaired,
leading thus to cell inactivation. The latter instead describes the effects of
a continuous radiation field on biological tissue. We prove the existence and
uniqueness of a solution to the above stochastic systems, characterizing its
probabilistic properties. We further couple the model describing the biological
system to a set of reaction-diffusion equations with random discontinuity that
model the chemical environment. At last, we study the large system limit of the

radiotherapy and space radioprotection being the most relevant. Further, the

distribution in galaxy clusters have been observationally detected for several
decades now. These strong lensing constraints provided high-fidelity mass
models for cluster lenses that include a detailed census of the substructure
down to $10^{9-10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Optimizing lens models, where the
cluster mass distribution is modeled by a smooth component and subhalos

deriving the subhalo mass function, providing important constraints on the

novel method to detect and measure individual perturbers (subhalos,
line-of-sight halos, and wandering supermassive black holes) by exploiting
their proximity to highly distorted lensed arcs in galaxy clusters, and by
modeling the local lensing distortions with curved arc bases. This method
offers the possibility of detecting individual low-mass perturber subhalos in
clusters and halos along the line-of-sight down to a mass resolution of $10^8\,

models and improving their consistency with observed two-dimensional
distributions of the depth of shower maximum, $X_\text{max}$, and signal at the
ground level as a function of zenith angle. The method relies on the assumption
that the mass composition is the same at all zenith angles, while the
atmospheric shower development and attenuation depend on composition in a
correlated way. In the present work, for each of the three leading LHC-tuned
hadronic interaction models, we allow a global shift $\Delta X_\text{max}$ of
the predicted shower maximum, which is the same for every mass and energy, and
a rescaling $R_\text{Had}$ of the hadronic component at the ground level which
is constant with the zenith angle.
  We apply the analysis to 2297 events reconstructed with both the fluorescence
and surface detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory with energies
$10^{18.5-19.0}$ eV and zenith angles below 60$^\circ$. Given the modeling
assumptions made in this analysis, the best fit reaches its optimum value when
shifting the $X_\text{max}$ predictions of hadronic interaction models to
deeper values and increasing the hadronic signal. This change in the predicted
$X_\text{max}$ scale alleviates the previously identified model deficit in the
hadronic signal (commonly called the muon puzzle) but does not fully remove it.
Because of the size of the adjustments $\Delta X_\text{max}$ and $R_\text{Had}$
and the large number of events in the sample, the statistical significance of
need for these adjustments is large, greater than 5$\sigma_\text{stat}$, even
for the combination of the systematic experimental shifts within
1$\sigma_\text{sys}$ that are the most favorable for the models.

different internal gravity wave triads. Each of these triads consists of a
parent wave and two daughter waves, with one daughter wave common between the
two triads. The parent waves are assumed to have the same frequency and
wavevector norm co-existing in a region of constant background stratification.
Such 5-wave systems may emerge in oceans, for example, via tide-topography
interactions, generating multiple parent internal waves that overlap. Two 2D
cases are considered: Case 1(2) has parent waves with the same horizontal
(vertical) wavenumber but with different vertical (horizontal) wavenumber. For
both cases, the 5WS is more unstable than triads for $f/\omega_1\gtrapprox0.3$,
where $\omega_1$ and $f$ are the parent wave and the local Coriolis frequency,
respectively. For $f/\omega_1\gtrapprox0.3$, the common daughter wave's
frequency is $\approx \omega_1-f $ and $f$ respectively for Cases 1 and 2. For
3D cases, 5WSs become more unstable as the angle ($\theta$) between the
horizontal wavevectors of the parent waves is decreased. Moreover, for any
$\theta$, 5WSs have higher growth rates than triads for
$f/\omega_1\gtrapprox0.3$. Numerical simulations match the theoretical growth
rates of 5WSs for a wide range of latitudes, except when $f/\omega_1\approx0.5$

parent waves when $f/\omega_1\approx0.5$. We formulate a reduced order model

collinear to the mean molecular long axis. Upon entering the ferroelectric
phase, droplets irradiated by unfocused beam undergo an electromechanical
instability and disintegrate by the explosive emission of fluid jets. We show
here that the regions of jets emission can be controlled by focusing the light
beam in areas close to the droplet's edge. Once emitted, the fluid jets can be
walked by moving the beam up to millimeter distance from the mother droplet.
Reverting the lithium niobate substrate, jets become thinner and show the
tendency of being repelled by the beam instead of being attracted, thus
offering an additional tool for their optical manipulation. These observations
may pave the way to intriguing applications of ferroelectric nematic fluids

equilibria of high-dimensional dynamic stochastic economic models are often

algorithm trades off errors between those -- potentially very different --

detection that explores subtle cues from indistinguishable backgrounds. To
address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based
Feature Shrinkage Pyramid Network (FSPNet), which aims to hierarchically decode

progressively aggregates adjacent transformer features through a layer-bylayer
shrinkage pyramid to accumulate imperceptible but effective cues as much as
possible for object information decoding. Extensive quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly

experimental and theoretical research activities. Their ability to carry
supercurrents with magnitudes depending on the polarity (current direction) -
termed supercurrent diode effect - might be practically exploited to design
dissipationless counterparts of contemporary semiconductor-based diodes.
Magnetic Josephson junctions realized in the two-dimensional electron gas
(2DEG) within a narrow quantum well through proximity to conventional
superconductors perhaps belong to the most striking and versatile platforms for
such supercurrent rectifiers. Starting from the Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach,
we provide a minimal theoretical model to explore the impact of the spin-orbit
coupling and magnetic exchange inside the 2DEG on the Andreev bound states and
Josephson current-phase relations. Assuming realistic junction parameters, we
evaluate the polarity-dependent critical currents to quantify the efficiency of
these Josephson junctions as supercurrent diodes, and discuss the tunability of
the Josephson supercurrent diode effect in terms of spin-orbit coupling,
magnetic exchange, and transparency of the nonsuperconducting weak link.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the junctions might undergo current-reversing
$ 0 $-$ \pi $-like phase transitions at large enough magnetic exchange, which
appear as sharp peaks followed by a sudden suppression in the
supercurrent-diode-effect efficiency. The characteristics of the Josephson
supercurrent diode effect obtained from our model convincingly reproduce many
unique features observed in recent experiments, validating its robustness and
suitability for further studies.

Will such entanglement analogs of CDWs survive still in MBL? From a constituent
viewpoint, a great deal of MBL is learnt from 1D spin or fermion systems where
carriers are scatter particles. What about the situation when multiple
interacting particles cluster in a random-potential background? To tackle these
questions, we study symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy in disordered
Bose-Hubbard (dBH) chain using numerical quantum quench dynamics. We
concentrate on 2 types of inhomogeneous initial states after mapping out the
energy-resolved dynamical phase diagram of the model. From time-evolving a
line-shape initial product state, we find the sudden formation of robust
entropy imbalance across different symmetry sectors, termed
entanglement-channel wave (ECW). Intriguingly, ECW melts in MBL under
strong-disorder limit. It is tempting to conjecture that melting of ECW and
freezing of CDW are duo traits inherent to disorder-induced MBL. Further, by
exploiting dynamical consequences of loading bosons onto one site, we find the
possibility to realize an interaction-facilitated cluster localization unique
to BH-type models at weak disorders. Together, the unraveled rich entanglement
dynamics manifests the intrinsic complexity of dBH model from a jointly energy-

transition metal oxides. Recently, a breakthrough has been achieved with the
fabrication of freestanding SrTiO$_3$ ultrathin films down to the monolayer
limit. However, the many-body effects on the quasiparticle and optical
properties of monolayer SrTiO$_3$ remain unexplored. Using state-of-the-art
many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation combined with the
Bethe-Salpeter equation, we study the quasiparticle band structure, optical and
excitonic properties of monolayer SrTiO$_3$. We show that quasiparticle
corrections significantly alter the band structure topology; however, the
widely used diagonal $G_0W_0$ approach yields unphysical band dispersions. The
correct band dispersions are restored only by taking into account the
off-diagonal elements of the self-energy. The optical properties are studied
both in the optical limit and for finite momenta by computing the electron
energy loss spectra. We find that the imaginary part of dielectric function at
the long wavelength limit is dominated by three strongly bound excitonic peaks
and the direct optical gap is associated to a bright exciton state with a large
binding energy of 0.93 eV. We discuss the character of the excitonic peaks via
the contributing interband transitions, and reveal that the lowest bound
excitonic state becomes optical inactive for finite momenta along $\Gamma$-M,
while the other two excitonic peaks disperse to higher energies and eventually
merge for momenta close to M.

symmetry associated with their intrinsic scale invariance. Under the
assumptions of spatial periodicity, stationarity, and locality, this symmetry
implies a particular scaling of the turbulent heat flux with the system's
parallel size, from which its scaling with the equilibrium temperature gradient
can be deduced under some additional assumptions. This macroscopic transport
prediction is then confirmed numerically for a reduced model of
electron-temperature-gradient-driven turbulence. The system realises this
scaling through a turbulent cascade from large to small perpendicular spatial
scales. The route of this cascade through wavenumber space (i.e., the
relationship between parallel and perpendicular scales in the inertial range)
is shown to be determined by a balance between nonlinear-decorrelation and
parallel-dissipation timescales. This type of ""critically balanced"" cascade,
which maintains a constant energy flux despite the presence of parallel
dissipation throughout the inertial range (as well as order-unity dissipative
losses at the outer scale) is expected to be a generic feature of plasma
turbulence. The outer scale of the turbulence, on which the turbulent heat flux
depends, is determined by the breaking of drift-kinetic scale invariance due to
the existence of large-scale parallel inhomogeneity (the parallel system size).

computer vision communities due to its implicit depth ambiguity and often
strong self-occlusion. Recently, in addition to the hand skeleton, jointly
estimating hand pose and shape has gained more attraction. State-of-the-art
methods adopt a model-free approach, estimating the vertices of the hand mesh
directly and providing superior accuracy compared to traditional model-based
methods directly regressing the parameters of the parametric hand mesh.
However, with the large number of mesh vertices to estimate, these methods are
often slow in inference. We propose an efficient variation of the previously
proposed image-to-lixel approach to efficiently estimate hand meshes from the
images. Leveraging recent developments in efficient neural architectures, we
significantly reduce the computation complexity without sacrificing the
estimation accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce an inverted kinematic(IK)
network to translate the estimated hand mesh to a biomechanically feasible set
of joint rotation parameters, which is necessary for applications that leverage
pose estimation for controlling robotic hands. Finally, an optional
post-processing module is proposed to refine the rotation and shape parameters
to compensate for the error introduced by the IK net. Our Lite I2L Mesh Net
achieves state-of-the-art joint and mesh estimation accuracy with less than
$13\%$ of the total computational complexity of the original I2L hand mesh

[1] and by Xu et al. [2], a significant difference in the scrambling rate of
integrable (many-body) systems was observed, depending on the initial state
being semiclassically localized around unstable fixed points or fully
delocalized (infinite temperature). Specifically, the quantum Lyapunov exponent
$\lambda_{\rm q}$ quantifying the OTOC growth is given, respectively, by
$\lambda_{\rm q}=2\lambda_{\rm s}$ or $\lambda_{\rm q}=\lambda_{\rm s}$ in
terms of the stability exponent $\lambda_{\rm s}$ of the hyperbolic fixed

point, features a distinct dynamical transition between these two regions. We
present an analytical semiclassical approach providing a physical picture of
this phenomenon and support our findings by extensive numerical simulations in
the whole parameter range of locally unstable dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard dimer.
Our results suggest that the existence of this transition is a hallmark of
unstable separatrix dynamics in integrable systems. This allows one to
distinguish, within the exponential OTOC growth behavior, unstable integrable

TRAPPIST-1 star's incident flux from only the dayside hemisphere of the planet.
The most straightforward interpretation is that there is little or no planetary

atmospheric absorption from carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) or other species.

Neural Networks (GNNs). Recent works employ different graph editions to
generate augmented environments and learn an invariant GNN for generalization.
However, the label shift usually occurs in augmentation since graph structural
edition inevitably alters the graph label. This brings inconsistent predictive
relationships among augmented environments, which is harmful to generalization.
To address this issue, we propose \textbf{LiSA}, which generates
label-invariant augmentations to facilitate graph OOD generalization. Instead
of resorting to graph editions, LiSA exploits \textbf{L}abel-\textbf{i}nvariant
\textbf{S}ubgraphs of the training graphs to construct \textbf{A}ugmented
environments. Specifically, LiSA first designs the variational subgraph
generators to extract locally predictive patterns and construct multiple
label-invariant subgraphs efficiently. Then, the subgraphs produced by
different generators are collected to build different augmented environments.
To promote diversity among augmented environments, LiSA further introduces a
tractable energy-based regularization to enlarge pair-wise distances between
the distributions of environments. In this manner, LiSA generates diverse
augmented environments with a consistent predictive relationship and
facilitates learning an invariant GNN. Extensive experiments on node-level and
graph-level OOD benchmarks show that LiSA achieves impressive generalization
performance with different GNN backbones. Code is available on

CLIP, have demonstrated great success in many vision-language tasks. These
methods achieve cross-modal alignment by encoding a matched image-text pair
with similar feature embeddings, which are generated by aggregating information
from visual patches and language tokens. However, direct aligning cross-modal
information using such representations is challenging, as visual patches and
text tokens differ in semantic levels and granularities. To alleviate this
issue, we propose a Finite Discrete Tokens (FDT) based multimodal
representation. FDT is a set of learnable tokens representing certain
visual-semantic concepts. Both images and texts are embedded using shared FDT
by first grounding multimodal inputs to FDT space and then aggregating the
activated FDT representations. The matched visual and semantic concepts are
enforced to be represented by the same set of discrete tokens by a sparse
activation constraint. As a result, the granularity gap between the two
modalities is reduced. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we
demonstrate that using FDT representations in CLIP-style models improves
cross-modal alignment and performance in visual recognition and vision-language
downstream tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can learn more
comprehensive representations, and the learned FDT capture meaningful
cross-modal correspondence, ranging from objects to actions and attributes.

first imaging results of HNCO (4--3) line wings toward nine sources in a sample

adopt the velocity range of the full width of HC$_{3}$N (10--9) and
H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (1--0) emissions as the central emission values, beyond which
the emission from HNCO (4--3) is considered to be from line wings. The spatial
distributions of the red- and/or blue-lobes of HNCO (4--3) emission nicely
associate with those lobes of HCO$^{+}$ (1--0) in most of the sources. High
intensity ratios of HNCO (4--3) to HCO$^+$ (1--0) are obtained in the line
wings. The derived column density ratios of HNCO to HCO$^+$ are consistent with
those previously observed towards massive star-forming regions. These results
provide direct evidence that HNCO could trace outflow in massive star-forming

from the perspective that aggregation is combining multiple individual updates,
this allows the application of sparsity to alleviate resource overhead. We show
that the use of sparsity can decrease the model size overhead by over

  Energy of Refractory High Entropy Alloys","20 pages,10 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Stacking fault energy (SFE) is an essential parameter for characterizing
mechanical properties. However, in high entropy alloys (HEAs), the local
chemical environment varies significantly across different stacking fault
planes, resulting in a substantial fluctuation of SFE values rather than a
unique value, which prohibits the prediction of the local SFE. Herein, we
proposed an effective descriptor based on the local concentration ratio near
stacking fault to quantitatively predict the local SFE of refractory HEAs. We
find that the role of a given element in determining SFE strongly depends on
its valence-electron number relative to other components and the contribution
of its s- and d-electrons to its cohesive properties, which can be understood
in the framework of the tight-binding model. Notably, the descriptor not only
unifies the local nature of SFE from simple alloys to HEAs but also helps to
quickly design HEAs as the involved parameters are easily accessible.

Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA), one of the most

certain combinatorial optimization problems by transforming a discrete
optimization problem into a classical optimization problem over a continuous
circuit parameter domain. QAOA objective landscape over the parameter variables
is notorious for pervasive local minima and barren plateaus, and its viability
in training significantly relies on the efficacy of the classical optimization

conventional gradient-based and gradient-free optimizers in terms of speed,
accuracy, and stability. We also address the issues of measurement efficiency

the space of solutions, with often an ergodicity breaking -- also known as
clustering or dynamical -- transition preceding the satisfiability threshold
when the constraint-to-variables ratio $\alpha$ is increased. However, smart
algorithms start to fail finding solutions in polynomial time at some threshold
$\alpha_{\rm alg}$ which is algorithmic dependent and generally bigger than the
dynamical one $\alpha_d$. The reason for this discrepancy is due to the fact
that $\alpha_d$ is traditionally computed according to the uniform measure over
all the solutions. Thus, while bounding the region where a uniform sampling of
the solutions is easy, it cannot predict the performance of off-equilibrium
processes, that are still able of finding atypical solutions even beyond
$\alpha_d$. Here we show that a reconciliation between algorithmic behaviour
and thermodynamic prediction is nonetheless possible at least up to some
threshold $\alpha_d^{\rm opt}\geq\alpha_d$, which is defined as the maximum
value of the dynamical threshold computed on all possible probability measures
over the solutions. We consider a simple Monte Carlo-based optimization
algorithm, which is restricted to the solution space, and we demonstrate that
sampling the equilibrium distribution of a biased measure improving on
$\alpha_d$ is still possible even beyond the ergodicity breaking point for the
uniform measure, where other algorithms hopelessly enter the out-of-equilibrium
regime. The conjecture we put forward is that many smart algorithms sample the
solution space according to a biased measure: once this measure is identified,
the algorithmic threshold is given by the corresponding ergodicity-breaking

problem. Recently-proposed accelerators attempt to optimize the throughput and
energy consumption of transformer models. However, such works are either
limited to a one-sided search of the model architecture or a restricted set of
off-the-shelf devices. Furthermore, previous works only accelerate model
inference and not training, which incurs substantially higher memory and
compute resources, making the problem even more challenging. To address these
limitations, this work proposes a dynamic training framework, called DynaProp,
that speeds up the training process and reduces memory consumption. DynaProp is
a low-overhead pruning method that prunes activations and gradients at runtime.
To effectively execute this method on hardware for a diverse set of transformer
architectures, we propose ELECTOR, a framework that simulates transformer
inference and training on a design space of accelerators. We use this simulator
in conjunction with the proposed co-design technique, called TransCODE, to
obtain the best-performing models with high accuracy on the given task and
minimize latency, energy consumption, and chip area. The obtained

These two abilities can culminate into a useful soft robotic gripper, such as
the original GelSight Fin Ray, which is able to grasp a large variety of
different objects and also perform a simple household manipulation task: wine
glass reorientation. Although the original GelSight Fin Ray solves the problem
of interfacing a generally rigid, high-resolution sensor with a soft, compliant
structure, we can improve the robustness of the sensor and implement techniques
that make such camera-based tactile sensors applicable to a wider variety of
soft robot designs. We first integrate flexible mirrors and incorporate the
rigid electronic components into the base of the gripper, which greatly
improves the compliance of the Fin Ray structure. Then, we synthesize a
flexible and high-elongation silicone adhesive-based fluorescent paint, which
can provide good quality 2D tactile localization results for our sensor.
Finally, we incorporate all of these techniques into a new design: the Baby Fin

problem of misalignment with the source features, resulting in deviations in
the keypoint features learned by the model.
  To overcome the above limitations, we propose a convolutional neural network

multiple stages features in the feature learning process. It combines with the
spatial-channel attention mechanism, which focuses on achieving adaptability in

aggregates features from multiple branches to align fused feature and obtain
refined local keypoint representation. Our model has the ability to focus on

Second, we perform policy optimization based on the decoupled latent

adaptively associate them with the current controllable state. This enables
long-horizon visuomotor control tasks to benefit from isolating mixed dynamics
sources in the wild, such as self-driving cars that can anticipate the movement

annotating 3D point clouds is laborious. However, existing methods are usually
complicated, e.g., pipelined training for 3D foreground/background
segmentation, cylindrical object proposals, and point completion. Furthermore,
they often overlook the inter-object feature relation that is particularly
informative to hard samples for 3D annotation. To this end, we propose a simple
yet effective end-to-end Context-Aware Transformer (CAT) as an automated 3D-box
labeler to generate precise 3D box annotations from 2D boxes, trained with a
small number of human annotations. We adopt the general encoder-decoder
architecture, where the CAT encoder consists of an intra-object encoder (local)
and an inter-object encoder (global), performing self-attention along the
sequence and batch dimensions, respectively. The former models intra-object
interactions among points, and the latter extracts feature relations among
different objects, thus boosting scene-level understanding. Via local and
global encoders, CAT can generate high-quality 3D box annotations with a
streamlined workflow, allowing it to outperform existing state-of-the-art by up
to 1.79% 3D AP on the hard task of the KITTI test set.

However, traditional dynamic data flow analysis tends to go astray in the

directed greybox fuzzer based on dynamic constraint filtering and focusing

are filtered as the next solution targets. Next, focusing on a single path
constraint to be satisfied, we obtain its data condition and probe the mapping
relationship between it and the input bytes through multi-byte mapping and
single-byte mapping. Finally, various mutation strategies are utilized to solve
the path constraint currently focused on, and the target location of the
program is gradually approached through path selection. The CONFF fuzzer can
reach a specific location faster in the target program, thus efficiently
triggering the crash. We designed and implemented a prototype of the CONFF
fuzzer and evaluated it with the LAVA-1 dataset and some real-world

problem, which aims to facilitate reasoning on Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs)

crucial, in light of the unsatisfying performance of existing reasoning methods
on those severely incomplete TKGs, especially in low-resource languages.
However, it poses tremendous challenges in two aspects. First, the
cross-lingual alignments, which serve as bridges for knowledge transfer, are
usually too scarce to transfer sufficient knowledge between two TKGs. Second,
temporal knowledge discrepancy of the aligned entities, especially when
alignments are unreliable, can mislead the knowledge distillation process. We
correspondingly propose a mutually-paced knowledge distillation model MP-KD,
where a teacher network trained on a source TKG can guide the training of a
student network on target TKGs with an alignment module. Concretely, to deal
with the scarcity issue, MP-KD generates pseudo alignments between TKGs based
on the temporal information extracted by our representation module. To maximize
the efficacy of knowledge transfer and control the noise caused by the temporal
knowledge discrepancy, we enhance MP-KD with a temporal cross-lingual attention
mechanism to dynamically estimate the alignment strength. The two procedures
are mutually paced along with model training. Extensive experiments on twelve
cross-lingual TKG transfer tasks in the EventKG benchmark demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed MP-KD method.

the replicas are evenly spaced in energy, separated by 150 +- 15 meV,
signalling the strong coupling of electrons in MATBG to a bosonic mode of this
energy. By comparing our observations to simulations, the formation of replicas
is attributed to the presence of strong inter-valley electron-phonon coupling
to a K-point phonon mode. In total, the observation of these replica flat bands
and the corresponding phonon mode in MATBG could provide important information
for understanding the origin and the unusual properties of its superconducting

analysis of ultrahigh-dimensional data. Sure independent screening procedure
has been demonstrated to be an effective method to reduce the dimensionality of
data from a large scale to a relatively moderate scale. For censored survival
data, the existing screening methods mainly adopt the Kaplan--Meier estimator
to handle censoring, which may not perform well for scenarios which have heavy
censoring rate. In this article, we propose a model-free screening procedure
based on the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). The proposed method
avoids the complication to specify an actual model from a large number of
covariates. Compared with existing screening procedures, this new approach has
several advantages. First, it does not involve the Kaplan--Meier estimator,
thus its performance is much more robust for the cases with a heavy censoring
rate. Second, the empirical estimate of HSIC is very simple as it just depends
on the trace of a product of Gram matrices. In addition, the proposed procedure
does not require any complicated numerical optimization, so the corresponding
calculation is very simple and fast. Finally, the proposed procedure which
employs the kernel method is substantially more resistant to outliers.
Extensive simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method has favorable
exhibition over the existing methods. As an illustration, we apply the proposed
method to analyze the diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) data and the

deformations. The numerical results demonstrate that, for systems with either
low or high symmetries, the nonlinear stability constraints can ensure
structural stability at the target load under large deformations. Post-analysis
on the B-spline fitted designs shows that the safety margin, i.e., the gap
between the target load and the 1st critical load, of the optimized structures
can be well controlled by selecting different stability constraint values.
Interesting structural behaviors such as mode switching and multiple
bifurcations are also demonstrated.

Further, the non-trivial band topology and presence of edge states are shown
through density functional theory (DFT) based theoretical calculations. All

to overcome the exponential attenuation of signal with distance. One class of
such repeaters utilizes quantum error correction to overcome losses in the
communication channel. Here we propose a novel strategy of using the bosonic
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code in a two-way repeater architecture with
multiplexing. The crucial feature of the GKP code that we make use of is the
fact that GKP qubits easily admit deterministic two-qubit gates, hence allowing
for multiplexing without the need for generating large cluster states as
required in previous all-photonic architectures based on discrete-variable
codes. Moreover, alleviating the need for such clique-clusters entails that we
are no longer limited to extraction of at most one end-to-end entangled pair
from a single protocol run. In fact, thanks to the availability of the analog
information generated during the measurements of the GKP qubits, we can design
better entanglement swapping procedures in which we connect links based on
their estimated quality. This enables us to use all the multiplexed links so
that large number of links from a single protocol run can contribute to the
generation of the end-to-end entanglement. We find that our architecture allows
for high-rate end-to-end entanglement generation and is resilient to
imperfections arising from finite squeezing in the GKP state preparation and
homodyne detection inefficiency. In particular we show that long-distance
quantum communication over more than 1000 km is possible even with less than 13
dB of GKP squeezing. We also quantify the number of GKP qubits needed for the
implementation of our scheme and find that for good hardware parameters our
scheme requires around $10^3-10^4$ GKP qubits per repeater per protocol run.

continuous-time random walk. To study more physical observables and supplement
the theory of the expanding medium problems, we characterize the nonuniformly
expanding medium with a spatial-temporal dependent scale factor $a(x,t)$, and
build the Langevin picture describing the particle's motion in the nonuniformly
expanding medium. By introducing a new coordinate, besides of the existing
comoving and physical coordinates, we build the relation between the
nonuniformly expanding medium and the uniformly expanding one, and further
obtain the moments of the comoving and physical coordinates. Both exponential

interpolation methods with keyframes, which result in a trivial local minimum

Particularly, our proposed framework consists of two stages for identifying a
latent motion subspace, i.e., a keyframe encoding stage and an intermediate

  Denoising","CVPR 2023 Camera Ready",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Significant progress has been made in self-supervised image denoising (SSID)
in the recent few years. However, most methods focus on dealing with spatially
independent noise, and they have little practicality on real-world sRGB images
with spatially correlated noise. Although pixel-shuffle downsampling has been
suggested for breaking the noise correlation, it breaks the original
information of images, which limits the denoising performance. In this paper,
we propose a novel perspective to solve this problem, i.e., seeking for
spatially adaptive supervision for real-world sRGB image denoising.
Specifically, we take into account the respective characteristics of flat and
textured regions in noisy images, and construct supervisions for them
separately. For flat areas, the supervision can be safely derived from
non-adjacent pixels, which are much far from the current pixel for excluding
the influence of the noise-correlated ones. And we extend the blind-spot
network to a blind-neighborhood network (BNN) for providing supervision on flat
areas. For textured regions, the supervision has to be closely related to the
content of adjacent pixels. And we present a locally aware network (LAN) to
meet the requirement, while LAN itself is selectively supervised with the
output of BNN. Combining these two supervisions, a denoising network (e.g.,
U-Net) can be well-trained. Extensive experiments show that our method performs
favorably against state-of-the-art SSID methods on real-world sRGB photographs.

gravitational collapse of a ball of dust supports the conclusion that such a
length scale is indeed dynamical and matter inside black holes forms extended
cores of macroscopic size. The geometry of these quantum black holes can be
described by coherent states which cannot contain modes of arbitrarily short
wavelength, compatibly with a matter core of finite size. Therefore, the
classical central singularity is not realised, yet the expected general
relativistic behaviour can be recovered in the weak-field region outside the
horizon with good approximation. Deviations from classical general relativistic
solutions are still present and form quantum hair which modify the

pay enough attention to dynamic features, which refers to a representation of
dynamic parts of silhouettes over time (e.g. legs). Since dynamic parts of the
human body are more informative than other parts (e.g. bags) during walking, in

Although previous evaluations suggest that it is of shock fracturing tectonic
origin, we propose that the equatorial troughs can be created by secondary
cratering from the largest impact basin, Rheasilvia. We calculated the
trajectories of ejecta particles from Rheasilvia by considering Vesta's rapid
rotation. As a result, we found that secondary craters should be parallel to
the latitude. In particular, if we assume that ejecta particles are launched at
an initial launch velocity of approximately 350-380 m/s and a launch angle of
25 degree, the parallel equatorial troughs, the Divalia Fossae, can be suitably
explained by secondary cratering. This model works well on objects, such as
Haumea, Salacia, and Chariklo, but not on Mercury, the Moon, and regular
satellites.

of deep learning (DL) approaches. Recently, the emerging graph neural networks
(GNNs) have also been introduced in the field of fault diagnosis with the goal
to make better use of the inductive bias of the interdependencies between the
different sensor measurements. However, there are some limitations with these
GNN-based fault diagnosis methods. First, they lack the ability to realize
multiscale feature extraction due to the fixed receptive field of GNNs.
Secondly, they eventually encounter the over-smoothing problem with increase of
model depth. Lastly, the extracted features of these GNNs are hard to
understand owing to the black-box nature of GNNs. To address these issues, a
filter-informed spectral graph wavelet network (SGWN) is proposed in this
paper. In SGWN, the spectral graph wavelet convolutional (SGWConv) layer is
established upon the spectral graph wavelet transform, which can decompose a
graph signal into scaling function coefficients and spectral graph wavelet
coefficients. With the help of SGWConv, SGWN is able to prevent the
over-smoothing problem caused by long-range low-pass filtering, by
simultaneously extracting low-pass and band-pass features. Furthermore, to
speed up the computation of SGWN, the scaling kernel function and graph wavelet
kernel function in SGWConv are approximated by the Chebyshev polynomials. The
effectiveness of the proposed SGWN is evaluated on the collected solenoid valve
dataset and aero-engine intershaft bearing dataset. The experimental results
show that SGWN can outperform the comparative methods in both diagnostic

quantum software engineering that help developers create quantum software with
good quality attributes. Specifically, reusability has been traditionally
considered an important quality attribute in terms of efficiency of cost and
effort. Increasing the reusability of quantum software will help developers
create more complex solutions, by reusing simpler components, with better
quality attributes, as long as the reused components have also these
attributes. This work focuses on the reusability of oracles, a well-known
pattern of quantum algorithms that can be used to perform functions used as
input by other algorithms. In particular, in this work, we present several
guidelines for making reusable quantum oracles. These guidelines include three
different levels for oracle reuse: the ideas inspiring the oracle, the function
which creates the oracle, and the oracle itself. To demonstrate these
guidelines, two different implementations of a range of integers oracle have
been built by reusing simpler oracles. The quality of these implementations is
evaluated in terms of functionality and quantum circuit depth. Then, we provide
an example of documentation following the proposed guidelines for both
implementations to foster reuse of the provided oracles. This work aims to be a
first point of discussion towards quantum software reusability. Additional work

We experimentally find that the root lies in two kinds of ambiguities: (1)
Selection ambiguity that selected pseudo labels are less accurate, since
classification scores cannot properly represent the localization quality. (2)
Assignment ambiguity that samples are matched with improper labels in
pseudo-label assignment, as the strategy is misguided by missed objects and
inaccurate pseudo boxes. To tackle these problems, we propose a
Ambiguity-Resistant Semi-supervised Learning (ARSL) for one-stage detectors.
Specifically, to alleviate the selection ambiguity, Joint-Confidence Estimation
(JCE) is proposed to jointly quantifies the classification and localization
quality of pseudo labels. As for the assignment ambiguity, Task-Separation
Assignment (TSA) is introduced to assign labels based on pixel-level
predictions rather than unreliable pseudo boxes. It employs a

compressed using Huffman coding for a sub-linear increase in network capacity
to the number of tasks. Surprisingly, in the inference step, SoftNet generated

are difficult to accurately identify, limiting the potential of machine
learning models. To address this issue, commonly used labeling methods assume
that the precursor onset occurs at a fixed time before the disruption, which
may not be consistent for different types of disruptions or even the same type
of disruption, due to the different speeds at which plasma instabilities
escalate. This leads to mislabeled samples and suboptimal performance of the
supervised learning predictor. In this paper, we present a disruption
prediction method based on anomaly detection that overcomes the drawbacks of
unbalanced positive and negative data samples and inaccurately labeled

of anomaly detection predictors based on different algorithms on J-TEXT and
EAST to evaluate the reliability of the precursor onset time inferred by the

onset times of different shots are not necessarily the same. Finally, we
optimize precursor labeling using the onset times inferred by the anomaly

between local models, resulting in a slow convergence rate and a reduction of
the accuracy of the global model. The current FL algorithms use the static
client learning strategy pervasively and can not adapt to the dynamic training

scheme for each client based on entropy theory to alleviate the deviation

It's difficult to design the optimal dynamic learning rate for each client as
the local information of other clients is unknown, especially during the local
training epochs without communications between local clients and the central

first introduce mean-field schemes to estimate the terms related to other

specific layer through improving feature extraction and refining features.
Specifically, M2S includes the proposed Cross-scale Aggregation Module (CAM)

accuracy of small object detection by utilizing M2S to generate an additional
detection head. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on two

amplitude dependent tune shifts is an essential condition for enlarging the DA.
In this paper, we study the correlation between the fluctuation of RDTs along
the ring and the DA area with double- and multi-bend achromat lattices. It is
found that minimizing the RDT fluctuations is more effective than minimizing
RDTs themselves in enlarging the DA, and thus can serve as a very powerful
indicator in the DA optimization. Besides, it is found that minimizing
lower-order RDT fluctuations can also reduce higher-order RDTs, which are not

of controlling the RDT fluctuations in enlarging the DA confirms that the local

of a system that comprises two fermions or bosons in a harmonic confinement
interacting through the Fermi--Huang pseudopotential remains strongly
correlated. A detailed analysis of the one-particle description of this
``contactium'' reveals several peculiarities that are not encountered in
conventional model systems (such as the two-electron harmonium atom, ballium,
and spherium) involving Coulombic interparticle interactions. First of all,
none of the natural orbitals (NOs) $\{ \psi_\mathfrak{n}(\omega;\vec r) \}$ of
the contactium is unoccupied, which implies nonzero collective occupancies for
all the angular momenta. Second, the NOs and their nonascendingly ordered
occupation numbers $\{ \nu_\mathfrak{n} \}$ turn out to be related to the
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a zero-energy Schr\""odinger equation with an
attractive Gaussian potential. This observation enables the derivation of their
properties such as the $\mathfrak{n}^{-4/3}$ asymptotic decay of
$\nu_\mathfrak{n}$ at the $\mathfrak{n} \to \infty$ limit (which differs from
that of $\mathfrak{n}^{-8/3}$ in the Coulombic systems), the independence of
the confinement energy ${v_\mathfrak{n} = \langle \psi_\mathfrak{n}(\omega;\vec
r) | \frac{1}{2} % \omega^2r^2 | \psi_\mathfrak{n}(\omega;\vec r) \rangle}$ of
$\mathfrak{n}$, and the $\mathfrak{n}^{-2/3}$ asymptotic decay of the
respective contribution $\nu_\mathfrak{n}t_\mathfrak{n}$ to the kinetic energy.
Upon suitable scaling, the weakly occupied NOs of the contactium turn out to be
virtually identical with those of the two-electron harmonium atom at the
${\omega \to \infty}$ limit, despite the entirely different interparticle
interactions in these systems.

may arise in situations where the sample size is not much larger than the data

terrestrial ecosystems, however, the mechanisms by which MPs are transported in
river flows are still unknown. The transport of MPs and natural sediment in
aquatic flows could be somewhat comparable, as particles are similar in size.
However, it is unknown how the lower density of MPs and their different
material properties impact their transport dynamics. To answer this, novel
laboratory experiments on bed load saltation dynamics in an open-channel flow,
using high-speed camera imaging and the detection of 11,035 individual
saltation events were used to identify the similarities and differences between
spherical MPs and spherical natural sediments transport. The tested MPs varied
in terms of size and material properties (density and elasticity). Our analysis
shows that the Rouse number accurately describes saltation length, height,
transport velocity and collision angles equally well for both MPs and natural
sediments. Through statistical inference, the distribution functions of
saltation trajectory characteristics for MPs were analogous to natural sediment
with only one sediment experiment (1.4 % of cases) differing from all other
plastic experiments. Similarly, only nine experiments (9.3 % of cases) showed
that collision angles for MPs differed from those of natural sediment
experiments. Differences observed in terms of restitution become negligible in
overall transport dynamics as turbulence overcomes the kinetic energy lost at
particle-bed impact, which keeps particle motion independent from impact.
Overall, spherical MP particles behave similarly to spherical natural sediments
in aquatic environments under the examined experimental conditions. This is
significant because there is an established body of knowledge for sediment
transport that can serve as a foundation for the study of MP transport.

detection models using only image-level annotations. State-of-the-art WSOD
detectors commonly rely on multi-instance learning (MIL) as the backbone of
their detectors and assume that the bounding box proposals of an image are
independent of each other. However, since such approaches only utilize the
highest score proposal and discard the potentially useful information from
other proposals, their independent MIL backbone often limits models to salient
parts of an object or causes them to detect only one object per class. To solve
the above problems, we propose a novel backbone for WSOD based on our tailored
Vision Transformer named Weakly Supervised Transformer Detection Network
(WSTDN). Our algorithm is not only the first to demonstrate that self-attention
modules that consider inter-instance relationships are effective backbones for
WSOD, but also we introduce a novel bounding box mining method (BBM) integrated
with a memory transfer refinement (MTR) procedure to utilize the instance
dependencies for facilitating instance refinements. Experimental results on

sparked an upsurge in adopting artificial intelligence (AI) to underpin the
challenges in network management and resource allocation under strict service
level agreements (SLAs). It inaugurates the era of massive network slicing as a
distributive technology where tenancy would be extended to the final consumer
through pervading the digitalization of vertical immersive use-cases. Despite
the promising performance of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in network
slicing, lack of transparency, interpretability, and opaque model concerns
impedes users from trusting the DRL agent decisions or predictions. This
problem becomes even more pronounced when there is a need to provision highly
reliable and secure services. Leveraging eXplainable AI (XAI) in conjunction
with an explanation-guided approach, we propose an eXplainable reinforcement
learning (XRL) scheme to surmount the opaqueness of black-box DRL. The core
concept behind the proposed method is the intrinsic interpretability of the
reward hypothesis aiming to encourage DRL agents to learn the best actions for
specific network slice states while coping with conflict-prone and complex
relations of state-action pairs. To validate the proposed framework, we target
a resource allocation optimization problem where multi-agent XRL strives to
allocate optimal available radio resources to meet the SLA requirements of
slices. Finally, we present numerical results to showcase the superiority of
the adopted XRL approach over the DRL baseline. As far as we know, this is the
first work that studies the feasibility of an explanation-guided DRL approach

energies around 3~PeV. Sources which are capable of accelerating hadrons to
such energies are called hadronic PeVatrons. However, hadronic PeVatrons have
not yet been firmly identified within the Galaxy. Several source classes,
including Galactic Supernova Remnants (SNRs), have been proposed as PeVatron
candidates. The potential to search for hadronic PeVatrons with the Cherenkov
Telescope Array (CTA) is assessed. The focus is on the usage of very high
energy $\gamma$-ray spectral signatures for the identification of PeVatrons.
Assuming that SNRs can accelerate CRs up to knee energies, the number of
Galactic SNRs which can be identified as PeVatrons with CTA is estimated within
a model for the evolution of SNRs. Additionally, the potential of a follow-up
observation strategy under moonlight conditions for PeVatron searches is
investigated. Statistical methods for the identification of PeVatrons are
introduced, and realistic Monte--Carlo simulations of the response of the CTA
observatory to the emission spectra from hadronic PeVatrons are performed.
Based on simulations of a simplified model for the evolution for SNRs, the
detection of a $\gamma$-ray signal from in average 9 Galactic PeVatron SNRs is
expected to result from the scan of the Galactic plane with CTA after 10 hours
of exposure. CTA is also shown to have excellent potential to confirm these
sources as PeVatrons in deep observations with $\mathcal{O}(100)$ hours of
exposure per source.

binary stars selected are F-/G-type dwarf stars with M-type dwarf companions
that contribute less than 2% of the flux at optical wavelengths. The light
curves typically show well-defined total eclipses with very little variability
between the eclipses. I have used near-infrared spectra obtained by the APOGEE
survey to measure the spectroscopic orbit for both stars in HD22064. Combined
with an analysis of the TESS light curve, I derive the following masses and
radii: $M_1 = 1.35 \pm 0.03 M_{\odot}$, $M_2 = 0.58 \pm 0.01 M_{\odot}$, $R_1 =
1.554 \pm 0.014 R_{\odot}$, $R_2 = 0.595 \pm 0.008 R_{\odot}$. Using $R_1$ and
the parallax from Gaia EDR3, I find that the primary star's angular diameter is
$\theta = 0.1035 \pm 0.0009 $ mas. The apparent bolometric flux of the primary
star is ${\mathcal F}_{\oplus,0} = (7.51\pm 0.09)\times10^{-9}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$. Hence, this F2V star has an effective temperature $T_{\rm eff,1} =
6763{\rm\,K} \pm 39{\rm \,K}$. HD22064 is an ideal benchmark star that can be
used for ""end-to-end"" tests of the stellar parameters measured by large-scale
spectroscopic surveys, or stellar parameters derived from asteroseismology with
PLATO. The techniques described here for HD22064 can be applied to the other

observations in 1781. In 1970, Anton Labeyrie pioneered a method, speckle
interferometry, that overcomes the usual resolution limits induced by
atmospheric turbulence by taking hundreds or thousands of short exposures and
reducing them in Fourier space. Our 2022 automation of speckle interferometry
allowed us to use a fully robotic 1.0-meter PlaneWave Instruments telescope,
located at the El Sauce Observatory in the Atacama Desert of Chile, to obtain
observations of many known binaries with established orbits. The long-term
objective of these observations is to establish the precision, accuracy, and
limitations of this telescope's automated speckle interferometry measurements.
This paper provides an early overview of the Known Binaries Project and provide
example results on a small-separation (0.27"") binary, WDS 12274-2843 B 228.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved impressive results. However no
prior works investigate 3D-aware GANs for 3D consistent multi-class
image-to-image (3D-aware I2I) translation. Naively using 2D-I2I translation
methods suffers from unrealistic shape/identity change. To perform 3D-aware
multi-class I2I translation, we decouple this learning process into a
multi-class 3D-aware GAN step and a 3D-aware I2I translation step. In the first
step, we propose two novel techniques: a new conditional architecture and an
effective training strategy. In the second step, based on the well-trained
multi-class 3D-aware GAN architecture, that preserves view-consistency, we
construct a 3D-aware I2I translation system. To further reduce the
view-consistency problems, we propose several new techniques, including a
U-net-like adaptor network design, a hierarchical representation constrain and
a relative regularization loss. In extensive experiments on two datasets,
quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that we successfully perform
3D-aware I2I translation with multi-view consistency.

advent of unsupervised semantic segmentation. Although the recent work
employing the vision transformer (ViT) backbone shows exceptional performance,
there is still a lack of consideration for task-specific training guidance and
local semantic consistency. To tackle these issues, we leverage contrastive
learning by excavating hidden positives to learn rich semantic relationships
and ensure semantic consistency in local regions. Specifically, we first
discover two types of global hidden positives, task-agnostic and task-specific
ones for each anchor based on the feature similarities defined by a fixed
pre-trained backbone and a segmentation head-in-training, respectively. A
gradual increase in the contribution of the latter induces the model to capture
task-specific semantic features. In addition, we introduce a gradient
propagation strategy to learn semantic consistency between adjacent patches,
under the inherent premise that nearby patches are highly likely to possess the
same semantics. Specifically, we add the loss propagating to local hidden
positives, semantically similar nearby patches, in proportion to the predefined
similarity scores. With these training schemes, our proposed method achieves
new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in COCO-stuff, Cityscapes, and Potsdam-3

  https://github.com/tulerfeng/OTGNet",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph neural networks (GNNs) for temporal graphs have recently attracted
increasing attentions, where a common assumption is that the class set for
nodes is closed. However, in real-world scenarios, it often faces the open set
problem with the dynamically increased class set as the time passes by. This
will bring two big challenges to the existing dynamic GNN methods: (i) How to
dynamically propagate appropriate information in an open temporal graph, where
new class nodes are often linked to old class nodes. This case will lead to a
sharp contradiction. This is because typical GNNs are prone to make the
embeddings of connected nodes become similar, while we expect the embeddings of
these two interactive nodes to be distinguishable since they belong to
different classes. (ii) How to avoid catastrophic knowledge forgetting over old
classes when learning new classes occurred in temporal graphs. In this paper,
we propose a general and principled learning approach for open temporal graphs,
called OTGNet, with the goal of addressing the above two challenges. We assume
the knowledge of a node can be disentangled into class-relevant and
class-agnostic one, and thus explore a new message passing mechanism by
extending the information bottleneck principle to only propagate class-agnostic
knowledge between nodes of different classes, avoiding aggregating conflictive
information. Moreover, we devise a strategy to select both important and
diverse triad sub-graph structures for effective class-incremental learning.
Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets of different domains

maximal Tc always occurs near the quantum critical point. In this paper, taking
hole-doped La2CuO4 as a classical example, we employ the first-principles band
structure and total energy calculations and Monte Carlo simulations to explore
how the symmetry-breaking magnetic ground state evolves with hole doping and
the origin of a dome-shaped superconductivity region in the phase diagram. We
demonstrate that the local antiferromagnetic ordering and doping play key roles
in determining the electron-phonon coupling, thus Tc. Initially, the La2CuO4
possesses a checkerboard local antiferromagnetic ground state. As the hole
doping increases, Tc increases with the increase of the density of states at
the Fermi surface. But as the doping increases further, the strength of the
antiferromagnetic interaction weakens. At the critical doping level, a magnetic
phase transition occurs that reduces the local antiferromagnetism-assisted
electron-phonon coupling, thus diminishing the Tc. The superconductivity
disappears in the heavily overdoped region when the antiferromagnetic ordering
disappears. These observations could account for why cuprates have a
dome-shaped superconductivity region in the phase diagram. Our study, thus,
contributes to a fundamental understanding of the correlation between doping,
local magnetic ordering, and superconductivity of HTS.

attention in recent years because of its power and scalability, where a
powerful specification logic for HSs is the cornerstone. Often, HSs are
naturally modelled by concurrent processes that communicate with each other.
However, existing specification logics cannot easily handle such models. In
this paper, we present a specification logic and proof system for Hybrid
Communicating Sequential Processes (HCSP), that extends CSP with ordinary
differential equations (ODE) and interrupts to model interactions between
continuous and discrete evolution. Because it includes a rich set of algebraic
operators, complicated hybrid systems can be easily modelled in an algebra-like
compositional way in HCSP. Our logic can be seen as a generalization and
simplification of existing hybrid Hoare logics (HHL) based on duration calculus
(DC), as well as a conservative extension of existing Hoare logics for
concurrent programs. Its assertion logic is the first-order theory of
differential equations (FOD), together with assertions about traces recording
communications, readiness, and continuous evolution. We prove continuous
relative completeness of the logic w.r.t. FOD, as well as discrete relative
completeness in the sense that continuous behaviour can be arbitrarily
approximated by discretization. Besides, we discuss how to simplify proofs
using the logic by providing a simplified assertion language and a set of sound
and complete rules for differential invariants for ODEs. Finally, we implement
a proof assistant for the logic in Isabelle/HOL, and apply it to verify two
case studies to illustrate the power and scalability of our logic.

the classical Boolean semantics by employing models of the form $\langle

new semantics $\varphi|\psi$ is strictly interpolated between
$\varphi\wedge\psi$ and $\varphi\vee\psi$. By imposing several constraints on
the choice functions we obtain corresponding notions of logical consequence
relations and corresponding systems of tautologies, with respect to which $|$

under logical equivalence and distributivity over its dual connective. Thus
various systems of Propositional Superposition Logic (PLS) arise as extensions

soundness is shown for all of them. Completeness is proved for the weakest of

dynamically sharing, in multi-agent systems, information harboured in
individual agents' quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks towards
resolving conflicts amongst the agents. We then deploy AXs in the XAI setting
in which a machine and a human interact about the machine's predictions. We
identify and assess several theoretical properties characterising AXs that are
suitable for XAI. Finally, we instantiate AXs for XAI by defining various agent
behaviours, e.g. capturing counterfactual patterns of reasoning in machines and
highlighting the effects of cognitive biases in humans. We show experimentally
(in a simulated environment) the comparative advantages of these behaviours in

lack of labeled data. In this paper, we tackle the task of animal pose
estimation with scarce annotations, where only a small set of labeled data and
unlabeled images are available. At the core of the solution to this problem
setting is the use of the unlabeled data to compensate for the lack of
well-labeled animal pose data. To this end, we propose the ScarceNet, a pseudo
label-based approach to generate artificial labels for the unlabeled images.
The pseudo labels, which are generated with a model trained with the small set
of labeled images, are generally noisy and can hurt the performance when
directly used for training. To solve this problem, we first use a small-loss
trick to select reliable pseudo labels. Although effective, the selection
process is improvident since numerous high-loss samples are left unused. We
further propose to identify reusable samples from the high-loss samples based
on an agreement check. Pseudo labels are re-generated to provide supervision
for those reusable samples. Lastly, we introduce a student-teacher framework to
enforce a consistency constraint since there are still samples that are neither
reliable nor reusable. By combining the reliable pseudo label selection with
the reusable sample re-labeling and the consistency constraint, we can make
full use of the unlabeled data. We evaluate our approach on the challenging
AP-10K dataset, where our approach outperforms existing semi-supervised

nonparametrics (BNPs) to develop learning-augmented versions of the popular
count-min sketch (CMS) recovery algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel
BNP approach to frequency recovery, which is not built from the CMS but still
relies on a sketch obtained by random hashing. Assuming data to be modeled as
random samples from an unknown discrete distribution, which is endowed with a
Poisson-Kingman (PK) prior, we provide the posterior distribution of the
empirical frequency of a symbol, given the sketch. Estimates are then obtained
as mean functionals. An application of our result is presented for the
Dirichlet process (DP) and Pitman-Yor process (PYP) priors, and in particular:
i) we characterize the DP prior as the sole PK prior featuring a property of
sufficiency with respect to the sketch, leading to a simple posterior
distribution; ii) we identify a large sample regime under which the PYP prior
leads to a simple approximation of the posterior distribution. Then, we develop
our BNP approach to a ""traits"" formulation of the frequency recovery problem,
not yet studied in the CMS literature, in which data belong to more than one
symbol (trait), and exhibit nonnegative integer levels of associations with
each trait. In particular, by modeling data as random samples from a
generalized Indian buffet process, we provide the posterior distribution of the
empirical frequency level of a trait, given the sketch. This result is then
applied under the assumption of a Poisson and Bernoulli distribution for the
levels of associations, leading to a simple posterior distribution and a simple
approximation of the posterior distribution, respectively.

dust-obscured Galactic regions is extremely difficult from photometry.
Fortunately, high-resolution infrared spectroscopy is a powerful tool for
determining the temperatures of stars with no dependence on interstellar
extinction. It has long been known that the depth ratios of
temperature-sensitive and relatively insensitive spectral lines are excellent
temperature indices. In this work, we provide the first extensive line depth
ratio (LDR) method application in the infrared region that encompasses both \H\
and \K\ bands (1.48 $\mu$m - 2.48 $\mu$m). We applied the LDR method to
high-resolution (R $\simeq$ 45,000) \H\ and \K-band spectra of 110 stars
obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph (IGRINS). Our sample
contained stars with 3200 $<$ \teff\ (K) $<$ 5500, 0.20 $\leq$ log g $<$ 4.6,
and $-$1.5 $<$ [M/H] $<$ 0.5. Application of this method in the \K-band yielded
21 new LDR$-$\teff\ relations. We also report five new LDR$-$\teff\ relations
found in the \H-band region, augmenting the relations already published by
other groups. The temperatures found from our calibrations provide reliable
temperatures within $\sim$70 K accuracy compared to spectral \teff\ values from
the literature.

superposition logic (PLS) developed in \cite{Tz17} could be extended so as to
successfully apply to first-order superposition logic(FOLS). There are two
options for such an extension. The apparently more natural one is the formula
choice semantics (FCS) based on choice functions for pairs of arbitrary
formulas of the basis language. It is proved however that the universal
instantiation scheme of FOL, $(\forall v)\varphi(v)\rightarrow\varphi(t)$, is
false, as a scheme of tautologies, with respect to FCS. This causes the total
failure of FCS as a candidate semantics. Then we turn to the other option which
is a variant of SCS, since it uses again choice functions for pairs of
sentences only. This semantics however presupposes that the applicability of
the connective $|$ is restricted to quantifier-free sentences, and thus the
class of well-formed formulas and sentences of the language is restricted too.
Granted these syntactic restrictions, the usual axiomatizations of FOLS turn
out to be sound and conditionally complete with respect to this second
semantics, just like the corresponding systems of PLS.

fluid flow becomes zero, the suspension reaches a steady (basic) state where
up-and-down swimming occurs due to interplay of phototaxis and diffusion. For
purely scattering suspensions, a bimodal steady state occurs due to scattering,
which reverts to a unimodal steady state as the angle of incidence increases
with fixed other governing parameters. To check the linear stability of the
suspension, a small perturbation to the basic state are considered and the
perturbed equations are solved by using the Newton-Raphson-Kantorovich (NRK)
iterative method. The linear stability of the same suspension predicts both
stable and oscillatory nature of disturbance for specific parameter ranges. A
rigid top surface, as well as diffuse and oblique collimated irradiation, make

their impact on social structures and social cohesion. In particular, the role
of recommender systems deployed at large scale by digital platforms such as
Facebook or Twitter has been overlooked. This paper draws on the literature on
cognitive science, digital media, and opinion dynamics to propose a faithful
replica of the entanglement between recommender systems, opinion dynamics and
users' cognitive biais on SNSs like Twitter that is calibrated over a large
scale longitudinal database of tweets from political activists. This model
makes it possible to compare the consequences of various recommendation
algorithms on the social fabric and to quantify their interaction with some
major cognitive bias. In particular, we demonstrate that the recommender
systems that seek to solely maximize users' engagement necessarily lead to an
overexposure of users to negative content (up to 300\% for some of them), a
phenomenon called algorithmic negativity bias, to a polarization of the opinion
landscape, and to a concentration of social power in the hands of the most
toxic users. The latter are more than twice as numerous in the top 1\% of the
most influential users than in the overall population. Overall, our findings
highlight the urgency to identify harmful implementations of recommender
systems to individuals and society in order better regulate their deployment on

leading to decreased performance of deep learning-based models. To resolve this
problem, most previous works have focused on filtering out degradation-causing
low-quality images while ignoring their potential value for models. Through
effectively learning and leveraging the knowledge of degradations, models can
better resist their adverse effects and avoid misdiagnosis. In this paper, we
raise the problem of image quality-aware diagnosis, which aims to take
advantage of low-quality images and image quality labels to achieve a more
accurate and robust diagnosis. However, the diversity of degradations and
superficially unrelated targets between image quality assessment and disease
diagnosis makes it still quite challenging to effectively leverage quality
labels to assist diagnosis. Thus, to tackle these issues, we propose a novel
meta-knowledge co-embedding network, consisting of two subnets: Task Net and
Meta Learner. Task Net constructs an explicit quality information utilization
mechanism to enhance diagnosis via knowledge co-embedding features, while Meta
Learner ensures the effectiveness and constrains the semantics of these
features via meta-learning and joint-encoding masking. Superior performance on
five datasets with four widely-used medical imaging modalities demonstrates the
effectiveness and generalizability of our method.

challenging. Many existing methods rely on manually designed features to detect
these bright spots, but they often fail to identify reflective flares created

an optical center symmetry prior, which suggests that the reflective flare and

three-dimensional clusters of cavitation bubbles are observed. Their shape is
compared with the negative pressure distribution computed with a CFD model and
allows us to estimate a cavitation threshold value. High-speed recordings of

curved free surface on the jetting dynamics of the bubbles was qualitatively
assessed by classifying the cavitation events using a non-dimensional stand-off
parameter which depends on the drop size, the bubble maximum radius and the
relative position of the bubble inside the drop. Additionally, we studied the
role of the drop's curvature by implementing a structural similarity algorithm
to compare cases with bubbles produced near a flat surface to the bubbles
inside the drop. This quantitative comparison method indicated the existence of
equivalent stand-off distances at which bubbles influenced by different
boundaries behave in a very similar way. The oscillation of the laser-induced
bubbles promote the onset of Rayleigh-Taylor and Rayleigh-Plateau
instabilities, observed on the drop's surface. This phenomenon was studied by
varying the ratio of the maximum radii of the bubble and the drop. The specific

exceptional point (EP). We reveal the existence EP as a singularity in the
parameter space of non-Hermitian couplings carrying a half-integer topological

the bulk and hybridized topological modes. While the bulk states and individual
topological modes remain localized at the boundaries due to skin effect, the
competition between the constituent non-Hermitian parameters can overcome the
strength of skin effect and lead to the complete \textit{delocalization} of
these hybridized modes. We obtain explicit analytic solutions for the
eigenfunction and the eigenenergy of the hybridized modes, which exactly match
the numerical results and successfully reveal the underlying cause of
delocalization and the emergence of EP.

travel requests is described by a Poisson process, meaning that there is only
statistical insight into request times, including the probability that two
requests may be pooled together. Taking advantage of this feature, we devise a
method to capture ride-pooling from a stochastic mesoscopic perspective. This
way, we are able to transform the original set of requests into an equivalent
set including pooled ones which can be integrated within standard network flow
problems, which in turn can be efficiently solved with off-the-shelf LP solvers
for a given ride-pooling request assignment. Thereby, to compute such an
assignment, we devise a polynomial-time algorithm that is optimal w.r.t. an
approximated version of the problem. Finally, we perform a case study of Sioux
Falls, South Dakota, USA, where we quantify the effects that waiting time and
experienced delay have on the vehicle-hours traveled. Our results suggest that
the higher the demands per unit time, the lower the waiting time and delay
experienced by users. In addition, for a sufficiently large number of demands
per unit time, with a maximum waiting time and experienced delay of 5 minutes,
more than 90% of the requests can be pooled.

the plasma and the surface boundaries is linked to a variety of highly relevant
phenomena for technological processes. One possible plasma-surface interaction
is the generation of secondary electrons (SEs), which significantly influence
the discharge when accelerated in the sheath electric field. However, SEs, in
particular electron-induced SEs ($\updelta$-electrons), are frequently
neglected in theory and simulations. Due to the relatively high threshold
energy for the effective generation of $\updelta$-electrons at surfaces, their
dynamics are closely connected and entangled with the dynamics of the
ion-induced SEs ($\upgamma$-electrons). Thus, a fundamental understanding of
the electron dynamics has to be achieved on a nanosecond timescale, and the
effects of the different electron groups have to be segregated. This work
utilizes $1d3v$ Particle-in-Cell/Monte Carlo Collisions (PIC/MCC) simulations
of a symmetric discharge in the low-pressure regime ($p\,=\, 1\,\rm{Pa}$) with
the inclusion of realistic electron-surface interactions for silicon dioxide. A
diagnostic framework is introduced that segregates the electrons into three
groups (""bulk-electrons"", ""$\upgamma$-electrons"", and ""$\updelta$-electrons"")

gap size $L_\mathrm{gap}$ is then presented as a control tool to alter the
dynamics of the discharge significantly. It is demonstrated that this control
results in two different regimes of low and high plasma density, respectively.
The fundamental electron dynamics of both regimes are explained, which requires
a complete analysis starting at global parameters (e.g., densities) down to

paid to the systematic management and construction of high-quality datasets.
Nevertheless, managing voluminous and high-velocity data streams is usually
performed manually (i.e. offline), making it an impractical strategy in

achieve life-cycle automation of data processes using DevOps principles.
However, determining the data quality based on a fitness scale constitutes a
complex task within the framework of DataOps. This paper presents a novel Data
Quality Scoring Operations (DQSOps) framework that yields a quality score for

approaches, an ML prediction-based approach that predicts the data quality
score and a standard-based approach that periodically produces the ground-truth
scores based on assessing several data quality dimensions. We deploy the DQSOps

We investigate the performance of the proposed methods numerically for the

linear and semilinear elliptic Poisson problems, compliance minimization in
linear elasticity, and the optimization of fluids in Navier-Stokes flow, where
we compare them to current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that the

demanding only slightly more resources per iteration. This shows that our

photon-mediated dipoledipole interactions, which can be engineered to realize
key applications in quantum information processing. A major obstacle for such
application is the fast decay of the excited states. By controlling two-band
Bloch oscillations in an atomic array under external magnetic field, here we
show that exotic subradiance can be realized and maintained at a time scale
upto 12 orders of magnitude larger than the spontaneous decay time in atomic
arrays with the finite size. The key finding is to show a way for preventing
the wavepacket of excited states scattering into the dissipative zone inside
the free space light cone, which therefore leads to the excitation staying at a
subradiant state for extremely long decay time. We show that such operation can
be achieved by introducing a spatially linear potential from external magnetic
field in atomic arrays and then manipulating interconnected two-band Bloch
oscillations along opposite directions. Our results also point out the
possibility of controllable switching between superradiant and subradiant
states, which leads to potential applications in quantum storage.

population of transiting exoplanets around early-type stars is still limited.
These planets allow us to investigate the planet properties and formation
pathways over a wide range of stellar masses and study the impact of high
irradiation on hot Jupiters orbiting such stars. We report the discovery of
TOI-615b, TOI-622b, and TOI-2641b, three Saturn-mass planets transiting main
sequence, F-type stars. The planets were identified by the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite (TESS) and confirmed with complementary ground-based and
radial velocity observations. TOI-615b is a highly irradiated ($\sim$1277
$F_{\oplus}$) and bloated Saturn-mass planet (1.69$^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$$R_{Jup}$
and 0.43$^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$$M_{Jup}$) in a 4.66 day orbit transiting a 6850 K
star. TOI-622b has a radius of 0.82$^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$$R_{Jup}$ and a mass of
0.30$^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$~$M_{Jup}$ in a 6.40 day orbit. Despite its high
insolation flux ($\sim$600 $F_{\oplus}$), TOI-622b does not show any evidence
of radius inflation. TOI-2641b is a 0.39$^{+0.02}_{-0.04}$$M_{Jup}$ planet in a
4.88 day orbit with a grazing transit (b = 1.04$^{+0.05}_{-0.06 }$) that
results in a poorly constrained radius of 1.61$^{+0.46}_{-0.64}$$R_{Jup}$.
Additionally, TOI-615b is considered attractive for atmospheric studies via
transmission spectroscopy with ground-based spectrographs and $\textit{JWST}$.
Future atmospheric and spin-orbit alignment observations are essential since
they can provide information on the atmospheric composition, formation and
migration of exoplanets across various stellar types.

like old movie restoration. Although recent methods perform well in still
scenes or scenes with regular movement, they always lack robustness in moving
scenes due to their weak ability in modeling long-term dependency both
spatially and temporally, leading to color fading, color discontinuity or other
artifacts. To solve this problem, we propose an exemplar-based video
colorization framework with long-term spatiotemporal dependency. To enhance the
long-term spatial dependency, a parallelized CNN-Transformer block and a double
head non-local operation are designed. The proposed CNN-Transformer block can
better incorporate long-term spatial dependency with local texture and
structural features, and the double head non-local operation further leverages
the performance of augmented feature. While for long-term temporal dependency
enhancement, we further introduce the novel linkage subnet. The linkage subnet
propagate motion information across adjacent frame blocks and help to maintain
temporal continuity. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms recent
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Also, our model
can generate more colorful, realistic and stabilized results, especially for
scenes where objects change greatly and irregularly.

portfolio including multi-modality and single-modality is diverse and complex.
Since the multi-modal methods have system complexity while the accuracy of
single-modal ones is relatively low, how to make a tradeoff between them is
difficult. In this work, we propose a universal cross-modality knowledge
distillation framework (UniDistill) to improve the performance of
single-modality detectors. Specifically, during training, UniDistill projects
the features of both the teacher and the student detector into Bird's-Eye-View
(BEV), which is a friendly representation for different modalities. Then, three
distillation losses are calculated to sparsely align the foreground features,
helping the student learn from the teacher without introducing additional cost
during inference. Taking advantage of the similar detection paradigm of
different detectors in BEV, UniDistill easily supports LiDAR-to-camera,
camera-to-LiDAR, fusion-to-LiDAR and fusion-to-camera distillation paths.
Furthermore, the three distillation losses can filter the effect of misaligned
background information and balance between objects of different sizes,
improving the distillation effectiveness. Extensive experiments on nuScenes
demonstrate that UniDistill effectively improves the mAP and NDS of student
detectors by 2.0%~3.2%.

availability of action labels during testing and the pairing of adverbs as
antonyms. Existing datasets for adverb recognition are either noisy, which
makes learning difficult, or contain actions whose appearance is not influenced
by adverbs, which makes evaluation less reliable. To address this, we collect a
new high quality dataset: Adverbs in Recipes (AIR). We focus on instructional

changes when performed differently. Videos in AIR are more tightly trimmed and

we use long short-term memory (LSTM)-based structures specifically designed to
handle multi-dimensional historical data of trip time and distances
simultaneously. Using it, we predict the future trip time and forecast the
distance a vehicle will travel by concatenating the outputs of LSTM networks
through fully connected layers. The second method uses attention-based LSTM
networks (At-LSTM) to perform the same tasks. The third method utilizes two
LSTM networks in parallel, one for forecasting the time of the trip and the
other for predicting the distance. The output of each LSTM is then concatenated
through fully connected layers. Finally, the last model is based on two
parallel At-LSTMs, where similarly, each At-LSTM predicts time and distance
separately through fully connected layers. Among the proposed methods, the most
advanced one, i.e., parallel At-LSTM, predicts the next trip's distance and
time with 3.99% error margin where it is 23.89% better than LSTM, the first
method. We also propose TimeSHAP as an explainability method for understanding

between the electrodes is 5cm. The plasma species density is calculated as a
function of the gas pressure, electron temperature, and the gas composition. In
a good agreement with recent experimental results, $CF^+_3$ and F are dominant
for all considered simulation parameters. The results explain the pathways to
perform atomic layer etching and nanolayer deposition processes. In order to
reveal the effect of electron heating on the discharge dynamics, The
spatiotemporal electron energy equation is coupled to the fluid model.
Tailoring the driven potential has been found to control the concentration of
some plasma species. When the plasma is driven with the fundamental frequency,
Ohmic and stochastic heating allows electrons to be heated symmetrically.
Higher harmonics give rise to an electrical asymmetry and electron heating
asymmetry between the powered and grounded sheaths. The electron temperature
depends on the driven harmonics; it adjusts gain and loss rates and some plasma
species densities.

chillers) are devices that use thermal energy instead of electricity to
generate heating and cooling, thereby facilitating the use of waste heat and
renewable energy sources such as solar or geothermal energy. Despite this
benefit, widespread use of AHPDs is still limited. One reason for this is
partly unsatisfactory control performance under varying operating conditions,
which can result in poor modulation and part load capability. A promising
approach to tackle this issue is using dynamic, model-based control strategies,
whose effectiveness, however, strongly depend on the model being used. This
paper therefore focuses on the derivation of a viable dynamic model to be used
for such model-based control strategies for AHPDs such as state feedback or
model-predictive control. The derived model is experimentally validated,
showing good modeling accuracy. Its modeling accuracy is also compared to
alternative model versions, that contain other heat transfer correlations, as a
benchmark. Although the derived model is mathematically simple, it does have
the structure of a nonlinear differential-algebraic system of equations. To
obtain an even simpler model structure, linearization at an operating point is
discussed to derive a model in linear state space representation. The
experimental validation shows that the linear model does have slightly worse
steady-state accuracy, but that the dynamic accuracy seems to be almost
unaffected by the linearization. The presented new modeling approach is
considered suitable to be used as a basis for the design of advanced,
model-based control strategies, ultimately aiming to improve the modulation and
part load capability of AHPDs.

the host star, and the pebble size. We perform nonisothermal three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations in a local frame to obtain the gas flow around the
planet. We then numerically integrate three-dimensional orbits of pebbles under
the obtained gas flow. Finally, assuming uniform spatial distribution of
incoming pebbles, we calculate net spin by summing up specific angular momentum
that individual pebbles transfer to the protoplanet at impacts. We find that a
protoplanet with the envelope acquires prograde net spin rotation regardless of
the planetary mass, the pebble size, and the headwind speed of the gas. This is
because accreting pebbles are dragged by the envelope that commonly has
prograde rotation. As the planetary mass or orbital radius increases, the
envelope is thicker and the prograde rotation is faster, resulting in faster
net prograde spin. When the dimensionless thermal mass of the planet, $m =
R_{\mathrm{Bondi}} / H$, where $R_{\mathrm{Bondi}}$ and $H$ are the Bondi
radius and the disk gas scale height, is larger than a certain critical mass
($m \gtrsim 0.3$ at $0.1 \, \mathrm{au}$ or $m \gtrsim 0.1$ at $1 \,
\mathrm{au}$), the spin rotation exceeds the breakup one. The predicted spin
frequency reaches the breakup one at the planetary mass $m_{\mathrm{iso,rot}}
\sim 0.1 \, (a / 1 \, \mathrm{au})^{-1/2}$ (where $a$ is the orbital radius),
suggesting that the protoplanet cannot grow beyond $m_{\mathrm{iso,rot}}$. It

assembly. In this work, we aim to set constraints on the structure of
turbulence using X-ray surface brightness fluctuations. We seek to consider the
stochastic nature of this observable and to constrain the structure of the
underlying power spectrum. We propose a new Bayesian approach, relying on
simulation-based inference to account for the whole error budget. We used the
X-COP cluster sample to individually constrain the power spectrum in four
regions and within $R_{500}$. We spread the analysis on the 12 systems to
alleviate the sample variance. We then interpreted the density fluctuations as
the result of either gas clumping or turbulence. For each cluster considered
individually, the normalisation of density fluctuations correlates positively
with the Zernike moment and centroid shift, but negatively with the
concentration and the Gini coefficient. The spectral index within $R_{500}$ and
evaluated over all clusters is consistent with a Kolmogorov cascade. The
normalisation of density fluctuations, when interpreted in terms of clumping,
is consistent within $0.5 R_{500}$ with the literature results and numerical
simulations; however, it is higher between 0.5 and $1 R_{500}$. Conversely,
when interpreted on the basis of turbulence, we deduce a non-thermal pressure
profile that is lower than the predictions of the simulations within 0.5
$R_{500}$, but still in agreement in the outer regions. We explain these
results by the presence of central structural residues that are remnants of the
dynamic assembly of the clusters.

little training data. While several transfer learning approaches have been
proposed in 3D, unfortunately, these solutions typically operate on an entire

classes, such as deformable organic shapes. In addition, there is currently a
lack of understanding of what makes pre-trained features transferable across
significantly different 3D shape categories. In this paper, we make a step
toward addressing these challenges. First, we analyze the link between feature
locality and transferability in tasks involving deformable 3D objects, while
also comparing different backbones and losses for local feature pre-training.
We observe that with proper training, learned features can be useful in such
tasks, but, crucially, only with an appropriate choice of the receptive field
size. We then propose a differentiable method for optimizing the receptive
field within 3D transfer learning. Jointly, this leads to the first learnable
features that can successfully generalize to unseen classes of 3D shapes such
as humans and animals. Our extensive experiments show that this approach leads
to state-of-the-art results on several downstream tasks such as segmentation,

(i.e., attributes and objects) from seen compositions and combining concept
knowledge into unseen compositions. The key to CZSL is learning the
disentanglement of the attribute-object composition. To this end, we propose to
exploit cross-attentions as compositional disentanglers to learn disentangled
concept embeddings. For example, if we want to recognize an unseen composition
""yellow flower"", we can learn the attribute concept ""yellow"" and object concept
""flower"" from different yellow objects and different flowers respectively. To
further constrain the disentanglers to learn the concept of interest, we employ
a regularization at the attention level. Specifically, we adapt the earth
mover's distance (EMD) as a feature similarity metric in the cross-attention
module. Moreover, benefiting from concept disentanglement, we improve the
inference process and tune the prediction score by combining multiple concept
probabilities. Comprehensive experiments on three CZSL benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous works in both
closed- and open-world settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

breach or penetration of the surgical tool to the cortical wall during
pilot-hole drilling is essential to avoid damage to vital anatomical structures
adjacent to the pedicle, such as the spinal cord, blood vessels, and nerves.
Currently, the guidance of pedicle drilling is done using image-guided methods
that are radiation intensive and limited to the preoperative information. This
work proposes a new radiation-free breach detection algorithm leveraging a
non-visual sensor setup in combination with deep learning approach. Multiple
vibroacoustic sensors, such as a contact microphone, a free-field microphone, a
tri-axial accelerometer, a uni-axial accelerometer, and an optical tracking
system were integrated into the setup. Data were collected on four cadaveric
human spines, ranging from L5 to T10. An experienced spine surgeon drilled the
pedicles relying on optical navigation. A new automatic labeling method based
on the tracking data was introduced. Labeled data was subsequently fed to the
network in mel-spectrograms, classifying the data into breach and non-breach.
Different sensor types, sensor positioning, and their combinations were
evaluated. The best results in breach recall for individual sensors could be
achieved using contact microphones attached to the dorsal skin (85.8\%) and
uni-axial accelerometers clamped to the spinous process of the drilled vertebra
(81.0\%). The best-performing data fusion model combined the latter two sensors
with a breach recall of 98\%. The proposed method shows the great potential of
non-visual sensor fusion for avoiding screw misplacement and accidental bone
breaches during pedicle drilling and could be extended to further surgical
applications.

assimilate project-specific information. Hereafter, the ontology-aided semantic

approach was evaluated based on 225 NLQs collected from BIM users, with a 91%

The trained interpolators were used to predict the light curve of RRab stars in

safeguard public data against unauthorized use for training deep learning
models. These methods add stealthy perturbations to the original image, thereby
making it difficult for deep learning models to learn from these training data
effectively. Current research suggests that adversarial training can, to a
certain degree, mitigate the impact of unlearnable example attacks, while
common data augmentation methods are not effective against such poisons.
Adversarial training, however, demands considerable computational resources and
can result in non-trivial accuracy loss. In this paper, we introduce the
UEraser method, which outperforms current defenses against different types of
state-of-the-art unlearnable example attacks through a combination of effective
data augmentation policies and loss-maximizing adversarial augmentations. In
stark contrast to the current SOTA adversarial training methods, UEraser uses
adversarial augmentations, which extends beyond the confines of $ \ell_p $
perturbation budget assumed by current unlearning attacks and defenses. It also
helps to improve the model's generalization ability, thus protecting against
accuracy loss. UEraser wipes out the unlearning effect with error-maximizing
data augmentations, thus restoring trained model accuracies. Interestingly,
UEraser-Lite, a fast variant without adversarial augmentations, is also highly
effective in preserving clean accuracies. On challenging unlearnable CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet-subset datasets produced with various attacks, it
achieves results that are comparable to those obtained during clean training.
We also demonstrate its efficacy against possible adaptive attacks. Our code is

comprising modes coupled with varying interaction strength is capable of
producing genuine multimode entanglement (GME), quantified via the generalized
geometric measure (GGM). We demonstrate that for a fixed interaction and
squeezing strength, the GME content of the resulting state increases as the
range of interactions between the waveguides increases, although the GGM
collapses and revives with the variation of interaction strength and time. To
illustrate the advantage of long-range interactions, we propose a quantity,
called accumulated GGM, measuring the area under the GGM curve, which clearly
illustrates the growing trends with the increasing range of interactions. We
analytically determine the exact expression of GGM for systems involving an
arbitrary number of modes, when all the modes interact with each other equally.
The entire analysis is performed in phase-space formalism. We manifest the
constructive effect of disorder in the coupling parameter, which promises a
steady production of GME, independent of the interaction strength.

physical properties. Systems containing magnetic materials, such as
platinum-cobalt, have been studied because of their potential for technological
applications, e.g. spintronics, magnetic storage and magnetic sensors. Since
the magnetic properties of thin layers are strongly related to the growth
parameters, the fine tuning of these parameters is necessary to produce
multilayers with specific properties required in various applications. Here, an
efficient approach to tune the coercive field of Co ultrathin films in the
multilayer by varying the underlayer thickness is demonstrated. Using magnetron
sputtering, we prepared multilayer systems of Au(x)/Pt(5nm)/Co(0.7nm)/Au(5nm)
with various thicknesses of Au underlayer. The surface morphology of
Au(x)/Pt(5nm) stack on which Co layer was deposited was studied by atomic force
microscopy. We show the possibility to control the interfacial roughness by
changing the Au underlayer thickness due to its island-like growth mechanism
(Volmer-Weber mode). As the nominal thickness of Au increases, the islands grow
in larger lateral size, resulting in a higher overall roughness of the layer
surface. Magnetization measurements indicate a direct influence of the
underlayer roughness on the coercivity of the multilayers by promoting
additional magnetic anisotropy. With thickness of the Au layer up to 20 nm, we
can change the coercive field in the range from ~200 Oe to ~1100 Oe, while
remaining a nearly constant saturation magnetization. The use of Cu replacing
Au underlayer in the same multilayers was also investigated, demonstrating the
possibility of coercivity adjustment using different materials. The results are
important for applications where the magnetic properties of multilayer
structures based on Co thin films could be adjusted via buffer layer roughness
engineering.

collaborative authentication schemes, their performance remains limited by the
rigidity of data collection and aggregated result. They also tend to ignore
attacker localization in the collaborative authentication process. To overcome
these challenges, a novel collaborative authentication scheme is proposed,
where multiple edge devices act as cooperative peers to assist the service
provider in distributively authenticating its users by estimating their
received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and mobility trajectory (TRA). More
explicitly, a distributed learning-based collaborative authentication algorithm
is conceived, where the cooperative peers update their authentication models
locally, thus the network congestion and response time remain low. Moreover, a
situation-aware secure group update algorithm is proposed for autonomously
refreshing the set of cooperative peers in the dynamic environment. We also
develop an algorithm for localizing a malicious user by the cooperative peers
once it is identified. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
scheme is eminently suitable for both indoor and outdoor communication
scenarios, and outperforms some existing benchmark schemes.

process. This requires intensive evaluation, also with regard to performance
and integrability. Here, the integration into TLS 1.3 plays an important role,
since it is used for 90% of all Internet connections. In the present work,
algorithms for quantum-safe key exchange during TLS 1.3 handshake were
reviewed. The focus is on the influence of dedicated network parameters such as
transmission rate or packet loss in order to gain insights regarding the
suitability of the algorithms under corresponding network conditions. For the
implementation, a framework by Paquin et al. was extended to emulate network
scenarios and capture the handshake duration for selected algorithms. It is
shown that the evaluated candidates Kyber, Saber and NTRU as well as the
alternative NTRU Prime have a very good overall performance and partly undercut
the handshake duration of the classical ECDH. The choice of a higher security
level or hybrid variants does not make a significant difference here. This is
not the case with alternatives such as FrodoKEM, SIKE, HQC or BIKE, which have
individual disadvantages and whose respective performance varies greatly
depending on the security level and hybrid implementation. This is especially
true for the data-intensive algorithm FrodoKEM. In general, the prevailing
network characteristics should be taken into account when choosing scheme and
variant. Further it becomes clear that the performance of the handshake is
influenced by external factors such as TCP mechanisms or MTU, which could
compensate for possible disadvantages due to PQC if configured appropriately.

fine-grained visual cues. The exploration of such innate properties of human
sketches has, however, been limited to that of image retrieval. In this paper,
for the first time, we cultivate the expressiveness of sketches but for the
fundamental vision task of object detection. The end result is a sketch-enabled
object detection framework that detects based on what \textit{you} sketch --
\textit{that} ``zebra'' (e.g., one that is eating the grass) in a herd of
zebras (instance-aware detection), and only the \textit{part} (e.g., ``head"" of
a ``zebra"") that you desire (part-aware detection). We further dictate that our
model works without (i) knowing which category to expect at testing (zero-shot)
and (ii) not requiring additional bounding boxes (as per fully supervised) and
class labels (as per weakly supervised). Instead of devising a model from the
ground up, we show an intuitive synergy between foundation models (e.g., CLIP)
and existing sketch models build for sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR), which
can already elegantly solve the task -- CLIP to provide model generalisation,
and SBIR to bridge the (sketch$\rightarrow$photo) gap. In particular, we first
perform independent prompting on both sketch and photo branches of an SBIR
model to build highly generalisable sketch and photo encoders on the back of
the generalisation ability of CLIP. We then devise a training paradigm to adapt
the learned encoders for object detection, such that the region embeddings of
detected boxes are aligned with the sketch and photo embeddings from SBIR.
Evaluating our framework on standard object detection datasets like PASCAL-VOC
and MS-COCO outperforms both supervised (SOD) and weakly-supervised object
detectors (WSOD) on zero-shot setups. Project Page:

leading to impacts on their convective dynamics. To account for these effects,
including the presence of a quasi-adiabatic temperature profile and entropy
sources due to dissipation, the compressibility is expressed through a
dissipation number, $\mathcal{D}$, proportional to the planet's radius and
gravity. In Earth's mantle, compressibility effects are moderate, but in large
rocky or liquid exoplanets (Super-Earths), the dissipation number can become
very large. This paper explores the properties of compressible convection when
the dissipation number is significant. We start by selecting a simple Murnaghan
equation of state that embodies the fundamental properties of condensed matter
at planetary conditions. Next, we analyze the characteristics of adiabatic
profiles and demonstrate that the ratio between the bottom and top adiabatic
temperatures is relatively small and probably less than 2. We examine the
marginal stability of compressible mantles and reveal that they can undergo
convection with either positive or negative superadiabatic Rayleigh numbers.
Lastly, we delve into simulations of convection performed using the exact
equations of mechanics, neglecting inertia (infinite Prandtl number case), and
examine their consequences for Super-Earths dynamics.

beta Pictoris system, taking advantage of the NEAR experiment using the
VLT/VISIR instrument. The goal of our analysis is to investigate both the
detection of the planet beta Pictoris b and of the disk features at mid-IR
wavelengths. In addition, by combining several epochs of observation, we expect
to constrain the position of the known clumps and improve our knowledge on the
dynamics of the disk. To evaluate the planet b flux contribution, we extracted
the photometry and compared it to the flux published in the literature. In
addition, we used previous data from T-ReCS and VISIR, to study the evolution
of the position of the southwest clump that was initially observed in the
planetary disk back in 2003. While we did not detect the planet b, we were able
to put constraints on the presence of circumplanetary material, ruling out the
equivalent of a Saturn-like planetary ring around the planet. The disk presents
several noticeable structures, including the known southwest clump. Using a
16-year baseline, sampled with five epochs of observations, we were able to
examine the evolution of the clump: the clump orbits in a Keplerian motion with
an sma of 56.1+-0.4 au. In addition to the known clump, the images clearly show
the presence of a second clump on the northeast side of the disk and fainter
and closer structures that are yet to be confirmed. We found correlations
between the CO clumps detected with ALMA and the mid-IR images. If the
circumplanetary material were located at the Roche radius, the maximum amount
of dust determined from the flux upper limit around beta Pictoris b would
correspond to the mass of an asteroid of 5 km in diameter. Finally, the
Keplerian motion of the southwestern clump is possibly indicative of a
yet-to-be-detected planet or signals the presence of a vortex.

one can ask the questions: given a theory $\mathcal{A}$, how many and which are
the possible extensions $\mathcal{B} \supset \mathcal{A}$ or subtheories
$\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{A}$? How to construct and classify them, and
study their properties? Extensions are typically described in the language of
algebra objects in the braided tensor category of representations of
$\mathcal{A}$, while subtheories require different ideas.
  In this paper, we review recent structural results on the study of
subtheories in the von Neumann algebraic formulation (conformal subnets) of a
given chiral CFT (conformal net). Furthermore, building on [BDG23], we provide
a ""quantum Galois theory"" for conformal nets analogous to the one for Vertex
Operator Algebras (VOA). We also outline the case of 3+1 dimensional Algebraic
Quantum Field Theories (AQFT). The aforementioned results make use of families
of (extreme) vacuum state preserving unital completely positive maps acting on
the net of von Neumann algebras, hereafter called quantum operations. These are
natural generalizations of the ordinary vacuum preserving gauge automorphisms,
hence they play the role of ""generalized global gauge symmetries"". Quantum
operations suffice to describe all possible conformal subnets of a given

Mn possesses a unique half-filled 3d electron structure, creating split virtual
bound states near the Fermi energy level and producing a large local magnetic
moment after vacancy formation. The resultant electron spin oscillations reduce
the number of electrons involved in charge density oscillations, destroying
charge screening and lowering potential interaction at the saddle point between
the vacancy and diffusing atom. This ultimately facilitates vacancy diffusion
by reducing energy level variations of conduction band electrons during the
diffusion process. These findings offer valuable insights into atom diffusion
mechanisms and open up new avenues for manipulating defect properties through
unique element design, thereby enabling the creation of high-performance alloys

Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can indeed provide fine channel
flexibility to improve communication quality of service (QoS) or restore
localization capabilities in challenging operating conditions, while
conventional approaches fail (e.g., due to insufficient infrastructure, severe
radio obstructions). In this paper, we tackle a general low-complexity approach
for optimizing the precoders that control such reflective surfaces under
hardware constraints. More specifically, it allows the approximation of any
desired beam pattern using a pre-characterized look-up table of feasible
complex reflection coefficients for each RIS element. The proposed method is
first evaluated in terms of beam fidelity for several examples of RIS hardware
prototypes. Then, by means of a theoretical bounds analysis, we examine the
impact of RIS beams approximation on the performance of near-field downlink
positioning in non-line-of-sight conditions, while considering several RIS
phase profiles (incl. directional, random and localization-optimal designs).
Simulation results in a canonical scenario illustrate how the introduced RIS
profile optimization scheme can reliably produce the desired RIS beams under
realistic hardware limitations. They also highlight its sensitivity to both the
underlying hardware characteristics and the required beam kinds in relation to
the specificity of RIS-aided localization applications.

  discs","Accepted for publication in mnras, 12 pages, 8 figures",,"10.1093/mnras/stad944",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We demonstrate that planet formation via pebble accretion is sensitive to
external photoevaporation of the outer disc. In pebble accretion, planets grow
by accreting from a flux of solids (pebbles) that radially drift inwards from
the pebble production front. If external photoevaporation truncates the outer
disc fast enough, it can shorten the time before the pebble production front
reaches the disc outer edge, cutting off the supply of pebble flux for
accretion, hence limiting the pebble mass reservoir for planet growth.
Conversely, cloud shielding can protect the disc from strong external
photoevaporation and preserve the pebble reservoir. Because grain growth and
drift can occur quickly, shielding even on a short time-scale (<1 Myr) can have
a non-linear impact on the properties of planets growing by pebble accretion.
For example a $10^{-3} M_\oplus$ planetary seed at 25 au stays at 25 au with a
lunar mass if the disc is immediately irradiated by a $10^3$ G$_0$ field, but
grows and migrates to be approximately Earth-like in both mass and orbital
radius if the disc is shielded for just 1 Myr. In NGC 2024, external
photoevaporation is thought to happen to discs that are <0.5 Myr old, which
coupled with the results here suggests that the exact planetary parameters can
be very sensitive to the star forming environment. Universal shielding for
time-scales of at least $\sim1.5$ Myr would be required to completely nullify
the environmental impact on planetary architectures.

interpretability score for each word based on the attention coefficient
distribution related to the part specific to the classification task within the
Transformer architecture. A human-grounded experiment is conducted to evaluate
and compare CLS-A to other interpretability methods. The experimental protocol
relies on the capacity of an interpretability method to provide explanation in

and correct response rates by human subjects. CLS-A performs comparably to
usual interpretability methods regarding average participant reaction time and
accuracy. The lower computational cost of CLS-A compared to other
interpretability methods and its availability by design within the classifier
make it particularly interesting. Data analysis also highlights the link

planets are likely to be entirely solid when significant mass loss occurs,
other than a thin magma pool on the day side. Consequently, the outflows from
the planets, and thus the dust tails, sample material only from the surface of
the planet. We also use our model to investigate the occurrence rate of planets
that can catastrophically evaporate, and find that, on average, a star in the
Kepler sample has approximately one such planet. Our value is above, but within
an order of magnitude of, the occurrence rate inferred from the Kepler
statistics for Super-Earths, implying that exotic mechanisms to produce the
catastrophically evaporating planet population may not be required. We also
find that the range of substellar temperatures of the observed systems are well
explained by recent theoretical models which only produce dust in a limited
temperature region.

Agent (AIDA), through a benchmark analysis against the rule-based Intelligent
Driver Model, and two neural network Behavior Cloning models. The models were
trained and tested on a real-world driving dataset using a consistent process.
The testing results showed that the AIDA predicted driving controls
significantly better than the rule-based Intelligent Driver Model and had
similar accuracy to the data-driven neural network models in three out of four
evaluations. Subsequent interpretability analyses illustrated that the AIDA's
learned distributions were consistent with driver behavior theory and that
visualizations of the distributions could be used to directly comprehend the
model's decision making process and correct model errors attributable to

alternative to black-box data-driven models and suggest a need for further
research focused on modeling driving style and model training with more diverse

of the unparameterized curve, a parameterization using the curvature function
is a canonical parameterization. The main idea is that to any physically

where profile variations were observed, they were attributable to different

among all datasets, and is likely to reflect more generalizable biological

ways of achieving this, and demonstrate that they work well on simulated and

ongoing challenge in the computer vision community which hinders progress in
the application of 3D models to real-world settings, such as autonomous
driving, virtual reality and remote sensing. We propose a novel, one-shot point
cloud simplification method which preserves both the salient structural
features and the overall shape of a point cloud without any prior surface
reconstruction step. Our method employs Gaussian processes with kernels defined
on Riemannian manifolds, allowing us to model the surface variation function
across any given point cloud. A simplified version of the original cloud is
obtained by sequentially selecting points using a greedy sparsification scheme.
The selection criterion used for this scheme ensures that the simplified cloud
best represents the surface variation of the original point cloud. We evaluate
our method on several benchmark datasets, compare it to a range of existing
methods and show that our method is competitive both in terms of empirical
performance and computational efficiency.

learn a global shared model from locally available streaming data. Most online
FL literature considers a best-case scenario regarding the participating

not met in real-world applications. Asynchronous settings can reflect a more
realistic environment, such as heterogeneous client participation due to
available computational power and battery constraints, as well as delays caused
by communication channels or straggler devices. Further, in most applications,
energy efficiency must be taken into consideration. Using the principles of
partial-sharing-based communications, we propose a communication-efficient
asynchronous online federated learning (PAO-Fed) strategy. By reducing the
communication overhead of the participants, the proposed method renders
participation in the learning task more accessible and efficient. In addition,
the proposed aggregation mechanism accounts for random participation, handles
delayed updates and mitigates their effect on accuracy. We prove the first and
second-order convergence of the proposed PAO-Fed method and obtain an
expression for its steady-state mean square deviation. Finally, we conduct
comprehensive simulations to study the performance of the proposed method on
both synthetic and real-life datasets. The simulations reveal that in
asynchronous settings, the proposed PAO-Fed is able to achieve the same
convergence properties as that of the online federated stochastic gradient
while reducing the communication overhead by 98 percent.

hardening proportional to the number density and size of the cavities and due
to the interaction of dislocations with intragranular helium defects. In
nanostructured metals containing a high density of interfacial sinks,
preferential cavity formation on the grain boundaries instead produces
softening and often attributed to enhanced interfacial plasticity. Employing
two grades of ultrafine-grained tungsten, we explore this effect using targeted
implantation studies to map cavity evolution as a function of the irradiation
conditions and quantify its impact on the mechanical response through
nanoindentation. Softening is reported at implantation temperatures above the
threshold for preferential grain boundary cavity formation but at a
sufficiently low fluence prior to the growth of intragranular cavities.
Collective changes in the mean cavity size, density, and morphology beneath a
residual impression on an implanted surface indicate that cavity coalescence
accompanied the reduction in hardness. Complementary atomistic simulations
demonstrate that, in tungsten grain structures exhibiting softening, grain
boundary bubble coalescence is driven by stress concentrations that further act
to localize strain in the grain boundaries through cooperative deformation
processes involving local atomic shuffling and sliding, dislocation emission,
and even the nucleation of unstable twinning events.

existing methodology that accounts for ME via a Bayesian framework that employs

  Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in various
applications due to their effectiveness in extracting features from data.
However, the performance of a CNN heavily depends on its architecture and
training process. In this study, we propose a layer-to-layer training method
and compare its performance with the conventional training method.
  In the layer-to-layer training approach, we treat a portion of the early
layers as a student network and the later layers as a teacher network. During
each training step, we incrementally train the student network to learn from
the output of the teacher network, and vice versa. We evaluate this approach on
VGG16, ResNext, and DenseNet networks without pre-trained ImageNet weights and
a regular CNN model.
  Our experiments show that the layer-to-layer training method outperforms the
conventional training method for both models. Specifically, we achieve higher
accuracy on the test set for the VGG16, ResNext, and DeseNet networks and the
CNN model using layer-to-layer training compared to the conventional training
method.
  Overall, our study highlights the importance of layer-wise training in CNNs
and suggests that layer-to-layer training can be a promising approach for
improving the accuracy of CNNs.

on Fay's trisecant identity for genus $g\geq 4$. For a given Riemann matrix
$\mathbb{B}\in\mathbb{H}^{g}$, the Fay identity establishes linear dependence
of secants in the Kummer variety if and only if the Riemann matrix corresponds
to a Jacobian variety as shown by Krichever. The theta functions in terms of
which these secants are expressed depend on the Abel maps of four arbitrary
points on a Riemann surface. However, there is no concept of an Abel map for
general $\mathbb{B} \in \mathbb{H}^{g}$. To establish linear dependence of the
secants, four components of the vectors entering the theta functions can be
chosen freely. The remaining components are determined by a Newton iteration to
minimize the residual of the Fay identity. Krichever's theorem assures that if
this residual vanishes within the finite numerical precision for a generic
choice of input data, then the Riemann matrix is with this numerical precision
the period matrix of a Riemann surface. The algorithm is compared in genus 4
for some examples to the Schottky-Igusa modular form, known to give the Jacobi

types of slow fluctuators in the Josephson junctions and the passive parts of
these superconducting circuits can be the cause, and devices usually suffer
from a combination of different noise sources, which are hard to disentangle
and therefore hard to eliminate. One contribution is magnetic 1/f noise caused
by fluctuating magnetic moments of magnetic impurities or dangling bonds in
superconducting inductances, surface oxides, insulating oxide layers, and
adsorbates. In an effort to further analyze such sources of noise, we have
developed an experimental set-up to measure both the complex impedance of
superconducting microstructures, and the overall noise picked up by these
structures. This allows for important sanity checks by connecting both
quantities via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Since these two
measurements are sensitive to different types of noise, we are able to identify
and quantify individual noise sources. The superconducting inductances under

cross-correlated dc-SQUID read-out chains. The resulting noise resolution lies

videos: action recognition, motion transfer, virtual trainers, rehabilitation,
etc. In this paper we dive into the understanding of this task from a geometric
point of view: in particular, we show that the basic properties that are
expected from a temporal alignment procedure imply that the set of aligned
motions to a template form a slice to a principal fiber bundle for the group of
temporal reparameterizations. A temporal alignment procedure provides a
reparameterization invariant projection onto this particular slice. This
geometric presentation allows to elaborate a consistency check for testing the
accuracy of any temporal alignment procedure. We give examples of alignment
procedures from the literature applied to motions of tennis players. Most of
them use dynamic programming to compute the best correspondence between two
motions relative to a given cost function. This step is computationally
expensive (of complexity $O(NM)$ where $N$ and $M$ are the numbers of frames).
Moreover most methods use features that are invariant by translations and
rotations in $\mathbb{R}^3$, whereas most actions are only invariant by
translation along and rotation around the vertical axis, where the vertical
axis is aligned with the gravitational field. The discarded information
contained in the vertical direction is crucial for accurate synchronization of
motions. We propose to incorporate keyframe correspondences into the dynamic
programming algorithm based on coarse information extracted from the vertical
variations, in our case from the elevation of the arm holding the racket. The
temporal alignment procedures produced are not only more accurate, but also
computationally more efficient.

to be a viable approach to dealing with changing conditions. Yet, the

design domain (ODD), i.e., the conditions for which the system was built

dealing with new contexts, require system evolution. While the system evolution
process has been automated substantially, it remains human-driven. Given the
growing complexity of computing systems, human-driven evolution will eventually
become unmanageable. In this paper, we provide a definition for ODD and apply
it to a self-adaptive system. Next, we explain why conditions not covered by
the ODD require system evolution. Then, we outline a new approach for
self-evolution that leverages the concept of ODD, enabling a system to evolve
autonomously to deal with conditions not anticipated by its initial ODD. We
conclude with open challenges to realise self-evolution.

  standardization process","5 pages, 4 figures, 1 tables",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Much of the research in supernova cosmology is based on an assumption that
the peak luminosity of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), after a standardization
process, is independent of the galactic environment. A series of recent studies
suggested that there is a significant correlation between the standardized
luminosity and the progenitor age of SNe Ia. The correlation found in the most
recent work by Lee et al. is strong enough to explain the extra dimming of
distant SNe Ia, and therefore casts doubts on the direct evidence of cosmic
acceleration. The present work improves the previous work by incorporating the
uncertainties of progenitor ages, which were ignored in Lee et al., into a
fully Bayesian inference framework. We find a weaker dependence of supernova
standardized luminosity on the progenitor age, but the detection of correlation
remains significant (3.3$\sigma$). Assuming that such correlation can be
extended to high redshift and applying it to the Pantheon SN Ia data set, we
find that the correlation cannot be the primary cause of the observed extra
dimming of distant SNe Ia. Further more, we use the PAge formalism, which is a
good approximation to many dark energy and modified gravity models, to do a
model comparison. The concordance Lambda cold dark matter model remains a good
fit when the progenitor-age dependence of SN Ia luminosity is corrected. The
best-fit parameters, however, are in $\sim 2\sigma$ tension with the standard
values inferred from cosmic microwave background observations.

  epitaxial thin films","33 pages, 16 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Antiferromagnetic CuMnAs thin films have attracted attention since the
discovery of the manipulation of their magnetic structure via electrical,
optical, and terahertz pulses of electric fields, enabling convenient
approaches to the switching between magnetoresistive states of the film for the
information storage. However, the magnetic structure and, thus, the efficiency
of the manipulation can be affected by the film morphology and growth defects.
In this study, we investigate the properties of CuMnAs thin films by probing
the defect-related uniaxial anisotropy of electric conductivity by contact-free
terahertz transmission spectroscopy. We show that the terahertz measurements
conveniently detect the conductivity anisotropy, that are consistent with
conventional DC Hall-bar measurements. Moreover, the terahertz technique allows
for considerably finer determination of anisotropy axes and it is less
sensitive to the local film degradation. Thanks to the averaging over a large
detection area, the THz probing also allows for an analysis of strongly
non-uniform thin films. Using scanning near-field terahertz and electron
microscopies, we relate the observed anisotropic conductivity of CuMnAs to the
elongation and orientation of growth defects, which influence the local
microscopic conductivity. We also demonstrate control over the morphology of
defects by using vicinal substrates.

a challenging task, especially in the case of unseen styles and new words, and

by generative models, the generalization towards rare characters has been
disregarded. In this work, we devise a Transformer-based model for Few-Shot
styled handwritten text generation and focus on obtaining a robust and
informative representation of both the text and the style. In particular, we
propose a novel representation of the textual content as a sequence of dense
vectors obtained from images of symbols written as standard GNU Unifont glyphs,
which can be considered their visual archetypes. This strategy is more suitable
for generating characters that, despite having been seen rarely during
training, possibly share visual details with the frequently observed ones. As
for the style, we obtain a robust representation of unseen writers' calligraphy

and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal in
generating words in unseen styles and with rare characters more faithfully than
existing approaches relying on independent one-hot encodings of the characters.

conventional skeleton-based action recognition; skeleton detection and tracking
errors, poor variety of the targeted actions, as well as person-wise and
frame-wise action recognition. A point cloud deep-learning paradigm is
introduced to the action recognition, and a unified framework along with a
novel deep neural network architecture called Structured Keypoint Pooling is
proposed. The proposed method sparsely aggregates keypoint features in a
cascaded manner based on prior knowledge of the data structure (which is
inherent in skeletons), such as the instances and frames to which each keypoint
belongs, and achieves robustness against input errors. Its less constrained and
tracking-free architecture enables time-series keypoints consisting of human
skeletons and nonhuman object contours to be efficiently treated as an input 3D
point cloud and extends the variety of the targeted action. Furthermore, we
propose a Pooling-Switching Trick inspired by Structured Keypoint Pooling. This
trick switches the pooling kernels between the training and inference phases to
detect person-wise and frame-wise actions in a weakly supervised manner using
only video-level action labels. This trick enables our training scheme to
naturally introduce novel data augmentation, which mixes multiple point clouds
extracted from different videos. In the experiments, we comprehensively verify
the effectiveness of the proposed method against the limitations, and the
method outperforms state-of-the-art skeleton-based action recognition and

Recent scanpath prediction models focus on goal-directed attention (search).
Such models are limited in their application due to a common approach relying

surpasses other models by a large margin on the ZeroGaze setting. It also
outperforms existing target-detection models on standard gaze prediction for

generalize to the end-user's environment -- ideally without additional
annotation efforts. One potential solution is to leverage unlabeled data (e.g.,
unlabeled LiDAR point clouds) collected from the end-users' environments (i.e.
target domain) to adapt the system to the difference between training and
testing environments. While extensive research has been done on such an
unsupervised domain adaptation problem, one fundamental problem lingers: there
is no reliable signal in the target domain to supervise the adaptation process.
To overcome this issue we observe that it is easy to collect unsupervised data
from multiple traversals of repeated routes. While different from conventional
unsupervised domain adaptation, this assumption is extremely realistic since
many drivers share the same roads. We show that this simple additional
assumption is sufficient to obtain a potent signal that allows us to perform
iterative self-training of 3D object detectors on the target domain.
Concretely, we generate pseudo-labels with the out-of-domain detector but
reduce false positives by removing detections of supposedly mobile objects that
are persistent across traversals. Further, we reduce false negatives by
encouraging predictions in regions that are not persistent. We experiment with
our approach on two large-scale driving datasets and show remarkable
improvement in 3D object detection of cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, bringing
us a step closer to generalizable autonomous driving.

""strongly extendible"", ""critical"" and ""strongly critical"", ""self-critical'' and
""strongly self-critical"", the definitions of which involve elementary
embeddings. Each large model property $\phi$ gives rise to a localization axiom
$Loc^{\phi}({\rm ZFC})$ saying that every set belongs to a transitive model of
ZFC satisfying $\phi$. The theories ${\rm LZFC}^\phi={\rm
LZFC}$+$Loc^{\phi}({\rm ZFC})$ are local analogues of the theories ZFC+""there
is a proper class of large cardinals $\psi$"", where $\psi$ is a large cardinal
property. If $sext(x)$ is the property of strong extendibility, it is shown
that ${\rm LZFC}^{sext}$ proves Powerset and $\Sigma_1$-Collection. In order to
refute $V=L$ over LZFC, we combine the existence of strongly critical models
with an axiom of different flavor, the Tall Model Axiom ($TMA$). $V=L$ can also
be refuted by $TMA$ plus the axiom $GC$ saying that ""there is a greatest
cardinal"", although it is not known if $TMA+GC$ is consistent over LZFC.
Finally Vop\v{e}nka's Principle ($VP$) and its impact on LZFC are examined. It
is shown that ${\rm LZFC}^{sext}+VP$ proves Powerset and Replacement, i.e., ZFC
is fully recovered. The same is true for some weaker variants of ${\rm
LZFC}^{sext}$. Moreover the theories LZFC$^{sext}$+$VP$ and ZFC+$VP$ are shown
to be identical.

Crucial for training such dual encoders is an accurate estimation of gradients

representation is its linearity, making it compatible with existing linear
systems theory. A finite-dimensional approximation of the Koopman operator can
be identified from experimental data by choosing a finite subset of lifting
functions, applying it to the data, and solving a least squares problem in the
lifted space. Existing Koopman operator approximation methods are designed to
identify open-loop systems. However, it is impractical or impossible to run
experiments on some systems without a feedback controller. Unfortunately, the
introduction of feedback control results in correlations between the system's
input and output, making some plant dynamics difficult to identify if the
controller is neglected. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a
method to identify a Koopman model of the closed-loop system, and then extract
a Koopman model of the plant given knowledge of the controller. This is
accomplished by leveraging the linearity of the Koopman representation of the

knowledge transferred from the seen domain, relying on the intrinsic
interactions between visual and semantic information. Prior works mainly
localize regions corresponding to the sharing attributes. When various visual
appearances correspond to the same attribute, the sharing attributes inevitably
introduce semantic ambiguity, hampering the exploration of accurate
semantic-visual interactions. In this paper, we deploy the dual semantic-visual
transformer module (DSVTM) to progressively model the correspondences between
attribute prototypes and visual features, constituting a progressive
semantic-visual mutual adaption (PSVMA) network for semantic disambiguation and
knowledge transferability improvement. Specifically, DSVTM devises an
instance-motivated semantic encoder that learns instance-centric prototypes to
adapt to different images, enabling the recast of the unmatched semantic-visual
pair into the matched one. Then, a semantic-motivated instance decoder
strengthens accurate cross-domain interactions between the matched pair for
semantic-related instance adaption, encouraging the generation of unambiguous
visual representations. Moreover, to mitigate the bias towards seen classes in
GZSL, a debiasing loss is proposed to pursue response consistency between seen
and unseen predictions. The PSVMA consistently yields superior performances
against other state-of-the-art methods. Code will be available at:

ATLAS Collaboration has measured the variance of the momentum per particle

steeply over a narrow multiplicity range corresponding to central collisions,
which hints at an emergent phenomenon. We show that the observed pattern is
explained naturally if one assumes that, for a given multiplicity, the momentum
per particle increases as a function of the impact parameter of the collision.
Since a larger impact parameter goes along with a smaller collision volume,
this in turn implies that the momentum per particle increases as a function of

more degrees of freedom of a single photon are correlated quantum-mechanically.
Here, we demonstrate a photonic integrated chip (PIC) able to generate and
manipulate single-photon path-entangled states, using a commercial red LED as
light source. A Bell test, in the Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH) form,
is performed to confirm the presence of entanglement, resulting in a maximum
value of the CHSH correlation parameter equal to $2.605 \pm 0.004$. This allows
us to use it as an integrated semi-device independent quantum random number
generator able to produce certified random numbers. The certification scheme is
based on a Bell's inequality violation and on a partial characterization of the
experimental setup, without the need of introducing any further assumptions
either on the input state or on the particular form of the measurement
observables. In the end a min-entropy of $33\%$ is demonstrated.

The notion of discrete twisted photons of the order $N$ is introduced and
orthogonality of these modes modulo $N$ is established. Both paraxial and
planar discrete twisted photons are considered. It is shown that in the
simplest scenario a $K$ times decrease of the circular arc where the receiving
array antenna is placed results in a $K$ times decrease of the number of

only the capability of {\it carrier sensing}: they can only distinguish between
the presence or absence of a beep, but receive no other information. The noisy

  Despite this extremely restrictive communication model, it transpires that
complex distributed tasks can still be performed by such networks. In this
paper we provide an optimal procedure for simulating general message passing in
the beeping and noisy beeping models. We show that a round of \textsf{Broadcast

noiseless) beeping model, and a round of \textsf{CONGEST} can be simulated in
$O(\Delta^2\log n)$ rounds (where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the

asymptotically fewer rounds.

due to structural differences between the fibers inside the handsheet. To
unravel this hypothesis, first, the hygro-expansion of freely and restrained
dried, hardwood and softwood handsheets has been characterized. Subsequently,
the transient full-field hygro-expansion (longitudinal, transverse, and shear
strain) of fibers extracted from these handsheets was measured using global
digital height correlation, from which the micro-fibril angle was deduced. The
hygro-expansivity of each individual fiber was tested before and after a
wetting period, during which the fiber's moisture content is maximized, to
analyze if a restrained dried fiber can ""transform"" into a freely dried fiber.
It was found that the longitudinal hygro-expansion of the freely dried fibers
is significantly larger than the restrained dried fibers, consistent with the
sheet-scale differences. The difference in micro-fibril angle between the
freely and restrained dried fibers is a possible explanation for this
difference, but merely for the hardwood fibers, which are able to ""transform""
to freely dried fibers after being soaked in water. In contrast, this
""transformation"" does not happen in softwood fibers, even after full immersion
in water for a day. Various mechanisms have been studied to explain the
observations on freely and restrained dried hardwood and softwood, fiber and

strategy in juvenile anacondas (Eunectes notaeus). In the S-start, named for
its eponymous shape, transient locomotion arises when the snake writhes and
bends out of the plane while rolling forward about its midsection without
slippage. To quantify our observations, we present a mathematical model for an
active non-planar filament that interacts anisotropically with a frictional
substrate and show that locomotion is due to a propagating localized pulse of a
topological quantity, the link density. A two-dimensional phase space
characterized by scaled body weight and muscular torque shows that relatively
light juveniles are capable of S-starts but heavy adults are not, consistent
with our experiments. Finally, we show that a periodic sequence of S-starts
naturally leads to a sidewinding gait. All together, our characterization of a
novel escape strategy in snakes highlights the role of topology in locomotion,
provides a phase diagram for mode feasibility as a function of body size, and
suggests a role for the S-start in the evolution of sidewinding.

We design HA-Fedformer, a novel transformer-based model that empowers unimodal
training with only a unimodal dataset at the client and multimodal testing by
aggregating multiple clients' knowledge for better accuracy. The key advantages
are twofold. Firstly, to alleviate the impact of data non-IID, we develop an
uncertainty-aware aggregation method for the local encoders with layer-wise
Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. Secondly, to overcome the challenge of
unaligned language sequence, we implement a cross-modal decoder aggregation to
capture the hidden signal correlation between decoders trained by data from
different modalities. Our experiments on popular sentiment analysis benchmarks,

the interactions between trains, trains and stations, and stations and other
stations on delay evolution based on different edges. In contrast to the
traditional methods that require the inputs to have constant dimensions (e.g.,
in rectangular or grid-like arrays) or only allow homogeneous nodes in the

from two sub-networks of the China railway network are applied to test the

EPSL parallelizes client-side model training and reduces the dimension of local

leading to a significant reduction in server-side training and communication
latency. Moreover, by considering the heterogeneous channel conditions and

pre-trained language models (PLMs) to a deeper model depth. Unlike prior work
that shares all parameters or uses extra blocks, we design a more capable
parameter-sharing architecture based on matrix product operator (MPO). MPO
decomposition can reorganize and factorize the information of a parameter
matrix into two parts: the major part that contains the major information
(central tensor) and the supplementary part that only has a small proportion of
parameters (auxiliary tensors). Based on such a decomposition, our architecture
shares the central tensor across all layers for reducing the model size and
meanwhile keeps layer-specific auxiliary tensors (also using adapters) for
enhancing the adaptation flexibility. To improve the model training, we further
propose a stable initialization algorithm tailored for the MPO-based
architecture. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our
proposed model in reducing the model size and achieving highly competitive
performance.

Detecting the trigger samples during the inference stage, i.e., the test-time

However, existing detection methods often require the defenders to have high
accessibility to victim models, extra clean data, or knowledge about the
appearance of backdoor triggers, limiting their practicality. In this paper, we
propose the test-time corruption robustness consistency evaluation (TeCo), a
novel test-time trigger sample detection method that only needs the hard-label

with the intriguing observation that the backdoor-infected models have similar
performance across different image corruptions for the clean images, but
perform discrepantly for the trigger samples. Based on this phenomenon, we
design TeCo to evaluate test-time robustness consistency by calculating the
deviation of severity that leads to predictions' transition across different
corruptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with
state-of-the-art defenses, which even require either certain information about
the trigger types or accessibility of clean data, TeCo outperforms them on
different backdoor attacks, datasets, and model architectures, enjoying a
higher AUROC by 10% and 5 times of stability.

where the distribution mismatch is alleviated. Extensive experiments are
conducted on two benchmark databases (SEED and SEED-IV) under a cross-subject

the proposed EEGmatch performs better than the state-of-the-art methods under

methodology based on global digital height correlation is extended to

quasi-3D characterization of the initial geometry of individual inter-fiber
bonds, including the fiber thickness and width along the length of the fibers
as well as the degree of wrap around and contact area of the bond, which are
vital for understanding the inter-fiber bond hygro-mechanics. Full-field
hygroscopic testing revealed novel insights on the inter-fiber interactions:
(i) the transverse hygro-expansion of each fiber strongly reduces when
approaching the bonded area, due to the significantly lower longitudinal
hygro-expansion of the other bonded fiber. (ii) The relatively large transverse
strain of one fiber stretches the other crossing fiber in its longitudinal
direction, thereby significantly contributing to the sheet scale
hygro-expansion. (iii) Out-of-plane bending is observed in the bonded region
which is driven by the significant difference in transverse and longitudinal
hygro-expansion of, respectively, the top and bottom fiber constituting the
bond. A bi-layer laminate model is derived to rationalize the bending
deformation and an adequate match is found with the experimental data. Under
the assumption of zero bending, which represents constrained inter-fiber bonds
inside a paper sheet, the model is able to predict the contribution of the
transverse strain in the bonded regions to the sheet-scale hygro-expansion.

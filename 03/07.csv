analytic expressions that fit data. While recent advances in deep learning have
generated renewed interest in such approaches, efforts have not been focused on
physics, where we have important additional constraints due to the units
associated with our data. Here we present $\Phi$-SO, a Physical Symbolic
Optimization framework for recovering analytical symbolic expressions from
physics data using deep reinforcement learning techniques by learning units
constraints. Our system is built, from the ground up, to propose solutions
where the physical units are consistent by construction. This is useful not
only in eliminating physically impossible solutions, but because it restricts
enormously the freedom of the equation generator, thus vastly improving
performance. The algorithm can be used to fit noiseless data, which can be
useful for instance when attempting to derive an analytical property of a
physical model, and it can also be used to obtain analytical approximations to
noisy data. We showcase our machinery on a panel of examples from astrophysics.

  Medical Image Analysis","Paper accepted at MIDL 2023",,,,"cs.CV cs.CY cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Although deep learning (DL) models have shown great success in many medical
image analysis tasks, deployment of the resulting models into real clinical
contexts requires: (1) that they exhibit robustness and fairness across
different sub-populations, and (2) that the confidence in DL model predictions
be accurately expressed in the form of uncertainties. Unfortunately, recent
studies have indeed shown significant biases in DL models across demographic
subgroups (e.g., race, sex, age) in the context of medical image analysis,
indicating a lack of fairness in the models. Although several methods have been
proposed in the ML literature to mitigate a lack of fairness in DL models, they
focus entirely on the absolute performance between groups without considering
their effect on uncertainty estimation. In this work, we present the first
exploration of the effect of popular fairness models on overcoming biases
across subgroups in medical image analysis in terms of bottom-line performance,
and their effects on uncertainty quantification. We perform extensive
experiments on three different clinically relevant tasks: (i) skin lesion
classification, (ii) brain tumour segmentation, and (iii) Alzheimer's disease
clinical score regression. Our results indicate that popular ML methods, such
as data-balancing and distributionally robust optimization, succeed in
mitigating fairness issues in terms of the model performances for some of the
tasks. However, this can come at the cost of poor uncertainty estimates
associated with the model predictions. This tradeoff must be mitigated if
fairness models are to be adopted in medical image analysis.

of diffuse warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM), the majority of which resides
in the filaments of the Cosmic Web and has proven very difficult to detect due
to its low density. Close to galaxy clusters, the filament gas is affected by
the cluster's gravitational potential and attains substantial infall
velocities, eventually undergoing a termination shock which may boost its X-ray
signal. We aim to identify the optimal locations of the enhanced X-ray emission
and absorption arising from cluster-filament interactions, as well as improve
our understanding of the various physical processes affecting the WHIM as it
approaches the cluster. We applied the DisPerSE filament finder to the galaxy
distribution in the surroundings of a Coma-like ($M_{200} \sim 10^{15.4}~{\rm
M}_{\odot}$) simulated C-EAGLE galaxy cluster. We characterised the
thermodynamic properties of the gas in such filaments as well as their
dependence on distance from the cluster, and provided a physical interpretation
for the results. The identified filaments account for $\sim 50$% of the hot
WHIM ($T > 10^{5.5}$ K) in the cluster vicinity. The filament gas is in
approximate free-fall all the way down to $\sim 2 \ r_{200}$ from the cluster,
at which stage it begins to slow down due to the increasing pressure of the
ambient gas. The deceleration is accompanied by the conversion of gas bulk
kinetic energy into heat and the increase of density and temperature from the
general Cosmic Web level of $\rho \sim 10\rho_{\rm av}$ and $T = 10^5-10^6$ K
towards $\rho \sim 100\rho_{\rm av}$ and $T = 10^7-10^8$ K near the cluster

beams, the frequency accuracy is well below 100 kHz. Over the vertical axis the
spectrometer benefits from shot-noise limited detection, signal enhancement via
multipass cell, active flattening of the spectral baseline and measurement

with chance constraints. The online RAP is a 0-1 integer linear programming
problem where the resource consumption coefficients are revealed column by
column along with the corresponding revenue coefficients. When a column is
revealed, the corresponding decision variables are determined instantaneously
without future information. Moreover, in online applications, the resource
consumption coefficients are often obtained by prediction. To model their
uncertainties, we take the chance constraints into the consideration. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first time chance constraints are introduced
in the online RAP problem. Assuming that the uncertain variables have known
Gaussian distributions, the stochastic RAP can be transformed into a
deterministic but nonlinear problem with integer second-order cone constraints.
Next, we linearize this nonlinear problem and analyze the performance of
vanilla online primal-dual algorithm for solving the linearized stochastic RAP.
Under mild technical assumptions, the optimality gap and constraint violation
are both on the order of $\sqrt{n}$. Then, to further improve the performance
of the algorithm, several modified online primal-dual algorithms with heuristic
corrections are proposed. Finally, extensive numerical experiments on both

one control electronics is used to control the entire array elements in the

understanding of the world between these extremes. In this work we establish
novel regret bounds for online convex optimization in a setting that
interpolates between stochastic i.i.d. and fully adversarial losses. By
exploiting smoothness of the expected losses, these bounds replace a dependence
on the maximum gradient length by the variance of the gradients, which was
previously known only for linear losses. In addition, they weaken the i.i.d.
assumption by allowing, for example, adversarially poisoned rounds, which were
previously considered in the related expert and bandit settings. In the fully
i.i.d. case, our regret bounds match the rates one would expect from results in
stochastic acceleration, and we also recover the optimal stochastically
accelerated rates via online-to-batch conversion. In the fully adversarial case
our bounds gracefully deteriorate to match the minimax regret. We further
provide lower bounds showing that our regret upper bounds are tight for all
intermediate regimes in terms of the stochastic variance and the adversarial

topological quantum materials in which it results from the electronic Berry
curvature. More recently, it has been recognized that certain magnetic point
group symmetries can significantly enrich the anomalous Hall response by
higher-order terms, which are induced by Berry curvature multipoles. Here we
report the observation of the 3rd order AHE at room temperature in epitaxially

model environments where the full state cannot be perceived by an agent. As
such the agent needs to reason taking into account the past observations and
actions. However, simply remembering the full history is generally intractable
due to the exponential growth in the history space. Keeping a probability
distribution that models the belief over what the true state is can be used as
a sufficient statistic of the history, but its computation requires access to
the model of the environment and is also intractable. Current state-of-the-art
algorithms use Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to compress the
observation-action history aiming to learn a sufficient statistic, but they
lack guarantees of success and can lead to suboptimal policies. To overcome
this, we propose the Wasserstein-Belief-Updater (WBU), an RL algorithm that

  epitaxial BaTiO3 integrated on Si 100","26 pages, 4 figures, 8 supplementary figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Lead free, silicon compatible materials showing large electromechanical
responses comparable to, or better than conventional relaxor ferroelectrics,
are desirable for various nanoelectromechanical devices and applications.
Defect-engineered electrostriction has recently been gaining popularity to
obtain enhanced electromechanical responses at sub 100 Hz frequencies. Here, we
report record values of electrostrictive strain coefficients (M31) at
frequencies as large as 5 kHz (1.04 x 10-14 m2 per V2 at 1 kHz, and 3.87 x
10-15 m2 per V2 at 5 kHz) using A-site and oxygen-deficient barium titanate
thin-films, epitaxially integrated onto Si. The effect is robust and retained
even after cycling the devices >5000 times. Our perovskite films are
non-ferroelectric, exhibit a different symmetry compared to stoichiometric
BaTiO3 and are characterized by twin boundaries and nano polar-like regions. We
show that the dielectric relaxation arising from the defect-induced features
correlates very well with the observed giant electrostrictive response. These
films show large coefficient of thermal expansion (2.36 x 10-5/K), which along
with the giant M31 implies a considerable increase in the lattice anharmonicity
induced by the defects. Our work provides a crucial step forward towards
formulating guidelines to engineer large electromechanical responses even at
higher frequencies in lead-free thin films.

harmonic generation (THG) was shown to directly probe the collective degrees of

superconducting La2-xSrxCuO4 establishing a protocol to access the transient

pump-THz-THG drive experiment and use a two-dimensional spectroscopy approach
to disentangle the driven third-harmonic response of optically excited
quasiparticles and the pure condensate response. In this way, 2D spectroscopy
separately probes both the ultrafast pair breaking dynamics and transient

  deorientations",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  By a well known theorem of Robbins, a graph $G$ has a strongly connected
orientation if and only if $G$ is 2-edge-connected and it is easy to find, in
linear time, either a cut edge of $G$ or a strong orientation of $G$.
  A result of Durand de Gevigny shows that for every $k\geq 3$ it is NP-hard to
decide if a given graph $G$ has a $k$-strong orientation. Thomassen showed that
one can check in polynomial time whether a given graph has a 2-strong
orientation. This implies that for a given digraph $D$ we can determine in
polynomial time whether we can reorient (=reverse) some arcs of $D=(V,A)$ to
obtain a 2-strong digraph $D'=(V,A')$. This naturally leads to the question of
determining the minimum number of such arcs to reverse before the resulting
graph is 2-strong. In this paper we show that finding this number is NP-hard.
  If a 2-connected graph $G$ has no 2-strong orientation, we may ask how many
of its edges we may orient so that the resulting mixed graph is still 2-strong.
Similarly, we may ask for a 2-edge-connected graph $G$ how many of its edges we
can orient such that the resulting mixed graph remains 2-arc-strong. We prove
that when restricted to graphs satisfying suitable connectivity conditions,
both of these problems are equivalent to finding the minimum number of edges we
must double in a 2-edge-connected graph in order to obtain a 4-edge-connected
graph. Using this, we show that all these three problems are NP-hard.
  Finally, we consider the operation of deorienting an arc $uv$ of a digraph
$D$ meaning replacing it by an undirected edge between the same vertices. In
terms of connectivity properties, this is equivalent to adding the opposite arc
$vu$ to $D$. We prove that for every $\ell\geq 3$ it is NP-hard to find the
minimum number of arcs to deorient in a digraph $D$ in order to obtain an
$\ell$-strong digraph $D'$.

representational collapse. Here we recast the problem in terms of efficient
coding by adopting manifold capacity, a measure that quantifies the quality of
a representation based on the number of linearly separable object manifolds it
can support, as the efficiency metric to optimize. Specifically, we adapt the
manifold capacity for use as an objective function in a contrastive learning
framework, yielding a Maximum Manifold Capacity Representation (MMCR). We apply
this method to unlabeled images, each augmented by a set of basic
transformations, and find that it learns meaningful features using the standard
linear evaluation protocol. Specifically, we find that MMCRs support
performance on object recognition comparable to or surpassing that of recently

representations learned by other SSL frameworks, and suggest a mechanism by
which manifold compression gives rise to class separability.

a possible origin of bistable switching in atomic-size contacts through
excitation of vibrations by inelastic electron scattering and underline the
power of the combined DFT-NEGF approach and statistical mechanics analysis of a
Langevin equation to overcome the time-scale gap between atomic motion and rare
switching events, allowing for an efficient exploration of the contacts'
configurational phase space.

investigation of non-perturbative phenomena in strongly-interacting quantum
field theories (QFTs). In the modern quantum era, with Noisy Intermediate Scale
Quantum~(NISQ) simulators widely available and larger-scale quantum machines on
the horizon, it is natural to ask: what non-perturbative QFT problems can be
solved with the existing quantum hardware? We show that existing noisy quantum
machines can be used to analyze the energy spectrum of a large family of
strongly-interacting 1+1D QFTs. The latter exhibit a wide-range of
non-perturbative effects like `quark confinement' and `false vacuum decay'
which are typically associated with higher-dimensional QFTs of elementary
particles. We perform quench experiments on IBM's ibmq_mumbai quantum simulator
to compute the energy spectrum of 1+1D quantum Ising model with a longitudinal
field. The latter model is particularly interesting due to the formation of
mesonic bound states arising from a confining potential for the Ising
domain-walls, reminiscent of t'Hooft's model of two-dimensional quantum
chromodynamics. Our results demonstrate that digital quantum simulation in the
NISQ era has the potential to be a viable alternative to numerical techniques
such as density matrix renormalization group or the truncated conformal space
methods for analyzing QFTs.

performs well on new scenes as it is not biased towards any training 3D data.

source class. We test for correlation between seven years of IceCube neutrino
data and a catalog containing more than 1000 core-collapse supernovae of types
IIn and IIP and a sample of stripped-envelope supernovae. We search both for
neutrino emission from individual supernovae, and for combined emission from
the whole supernova sample through a stacking analysis. No significant spatial
or temporal correlation of neutrinos with the cataloged supernovae was found.
The overall deviation of all tested scenarios from the background expectation
yields a p-value of 93% which is fully compatible with background. The derived
upper limits on the total energy emitted in neutrinos are $1.7\times 10^{48}$
erg for stripped-envelope supernovae, $2.8\times 10^{48}$ erg for type IIP, and
$1.3\times 10^{49}$ erg for type IIn SNe, the latter disfavouring models with
optimistic assumptions for neutrino production in interacting supernovae. We
conclude that strippe-envelope supernovae and supernovae of type IIn do not
contribute more than $14.6\%$ and $33.9\%$ respectively to the diffuse neutrino
flux in the energy range of about $10^3-10^5$ GeV, assuming that the neutrino
energy spectrum follows a power-law with an index of $-2.5$. Under the same
assumption, we can only constrain the contribution of type IIP SNe to no more
than $59.9\%$. Thus core-collapse supernovae of types IIn and stripped-envelope
supernovae can both be ruled out as the dominant source of the diffuse neutrino
flux under the given assumptions.

to be detected in the presence of a strong gamma-ray background. The most

method requires the optimization of specific parameters to obtain the best
gamma-neutron separation. These parameters depend on the scintillating material

and a calibration reference measurement with a mixed source. In this paper, we
propose a new method based on the scintillation fluorescence physics that
enables to find the optimum PSD integration gates using only a gamma-ray

deuterated trans-stilbene, small-molecule organic glass, and EJ-309. In all the

pulse onto a cold diluted plasma at rest. Choosing the $\vec{z}$-axis in the
propagation direction, if the pulse profile and the initial plasma density
(IPD) depend only on $z$, then suitable matched bounds on the maximum and the
relative variations of the IPD, as well as the intensity and duration of the
pulse, ensure a strictly hydrodynamic evolution of the electron fluid during
its whole interaction with the pulse, while ions can be regarded as immobile.
This evolution is ruled by a family (parametrized by $Z\ge 0$) of decoupled
systems of non-autonomous Hamilton equations with 1 degree of freedom, which
determine how electrons initially located in the layer $Z\le z<Z+dZ$ move;
$\xi=ct-z$ replaces time $t$ as the independent variable. This family of ODEs
is obtained by reduction from the Lorentz-Maxwell and continuity PDEs for the
electrons' fluid within the spacetime region where depletion of the pulse is
negligible. After the laser-plasma interaction the Jacobian of the map from
Lagrangian to Eulerian coordinates is ""linear-quasi-periodic"" in $\xi$. We
determine spacetime locations and features of the first wave-breakings of the
wakefield plasma wave (PW), the motion of test electrons (self-)injected in the
PW. The energy of those trapped in a single PW trough grows linearly with the
distance gone; in our model such electrons cannot dephase, as the PW has phase
velocity $c$. If the impacting laser pulse is symmetric around the
$\vec{z}$-axis and has a not too small radius $R$, the same conclusions hold
for the part of the plasma close to $\vec{z}$ and enclosed within the causal
cone swept by the pulse. This computationally light approach may help in a
preliminary study of extreme acceleration mechanisms of electrons, before 2D or
3D PIC simulations.

representation models, such as CLIP, on large amounts of paired image-text
data. However, previous studies have revealed that such models are vulnerable
to backdoor attacks. Specifically, when trained on backdoored examples, CLIP
learns spurious correlations between the embedded backdoor trigger and the
target label, aligning their representations in the joint embedding space.
Injecting even a small number of poisoned examples, such as 75 examples in 3
million pretraining data, can significantly manipulate the model's behavior,
making it difficult to detect or unlearn such correlations. To address this
issue, we propose CleanCLIP, a finetuning framework that weakens the learned
spurious associations introduced by backdoor attacks by independently
re-aligning the representations for individual modalities. We demonstrate that
unsupervised finetuning using a combination of multimodal contrastive and
unimodal self-supervised objectives for individual modalities can significantly
reduce the impact of the backdoor attack. Additionally, we show that supervised
finetuning on task-specific labeled image data removes the backdoor trigger
from the CLIP vision encoder. We show empirically that CleanCLIP maintains
model performance on benign examples while erasing a range of backdoor attacks

time series data in various domains, enabling real-time monitoring of

propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method for time series data. The
proposed framework jointly learns the observation model and the dynamic model,
and model uncertainty is estimated from normal samples. Specifically, a long
short-term memory (LSTM)-based encoder-decoder is adopted to represent the
mapping between the observation space and the latent space. Bidirectional
transitions of states are simultaneously modeled by leveraging backward and
forward temporal information. Regularization of the latent space places
constraints on the states of normal samples, and Mahalanobis distance is used
to evaluate the abnormality level. Empirical studies on synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method
in anomaly detection tasks.

Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been
widely utilized to identify, classify, or mitigate interference due to their
ability to learn from the data directly. However, there have been limited
research on the complexity of such deep learning models. The major focus of
deep learning-based wireless classification literature has been on improving
classification accuracy, often at the expense of model complexity. This may not
be practical for many wireless devices, such as, internet of things (IoT)
devices, which usually have very limited computational resources and cannot
handle very complex models. Thus, it becomes important to account for model
complexity when designing deep learning-based models for interference
classification. To address this, we conduct an analysis of CNN based wireless
classification that explores the trade-off amongst dataset size, CNN model
complexity, and classification accuracy under various levels of classification
difficulty: namely, interference classification, heterogeneous transmitter
classification, and homogeneous transmitter classification. Our study, based on
three wireless datasets, shows that a simpler CNN model with fewer parameters
can perform just as well as a more complex model, providing important insights
into the use of CNNs in computationally constrained applications.

transparent conductors and light absorbers for solar photoconversion due to the
tunability of their electronic conductivity and optical absorption.
Comparatively, these oxides have found limited applications in
solar-to-hydrogen photocatalysis primarily due to their high electronegativity,
which impedes electron transfer for converting protons into molecular hydrogen.
We have shown recently that inserting $\textit{s}$-block metal cations into
$\textit{p}$-block oxides is effective at lowering electronegativities while
affording further control of band gaps. Here, we explain the origins of this
dual tunability by demonstrating the mediator role of $\textit{s}$-block metal
cations in modulating orbital hybridization while not contributing to frontier
electronic states. From this result, we carry out a comprehensive computational
study of 109 ternary oxides of $\textit{s}$- and $\textit{p}$-block metal

downselect the most desirable materials using band gaps and band edges obtained
from Hubbard-corrected density-functional theory with Hubbard parameters
computed entirely from first principles, evaluate the stability of these oxides
in aqueous conditions, and characterize experimentally four of the remaining
materials, synthesized with high phase uniformity, to assess the accuracy of
computational predictions. We thus propose seven oxide semiconductors,

communication and distributed quantum computation by performing entanglement
distribution. Multi-user quantum applications where quantum information is
shared between multiple users require access to a shared multipartite state
between the users. We consider the problem of designing protocols for
distributing such states, at an increased entanglement rate.
  We propose three protocols that increase the entanglement rate of multi-user
applications by leveraging multipath routing. The protocols are evaluated on
quantum networks with NISQ constraints, including limited quantum memories and
probabilistic entanglement generation. Monte Carlo simulation results show that
the developed protocols achieve an exponential speedup of entanglement rate
compared to single-path routing techniques, with a maximum speedup of four
orders of magnitude for the cases studied. The speedup was also found to
improve for larger sets of users. When the protocols were tested in scaled-down
real-world topologies, it was found that topology can have a significant effect
on the achievable entanglement rates, with one order of magnitude difference
between topologies. Finally, we find that the benefits of multipath routing are
a maximum for short quantum memory decoherence times, and intermediate values
of entanglement generation probability. Hence the protocols developed can
benefit NISQ quantum network control and design.

for each cast card and a ""link"" identifying which CVR is for which card --
which many voting systems cannot provide. Every set of CVRs that produces the

overstatement-net-equivalent (ONE). CLCAs can therefore use CVRs from the
voting system for any number of cards and ONE CVRs for the rest. Ballot-polling
RLAs are equivalent to CLCAs using ONE CVRs. CLCAs can be based on batch-level
results (e.g., precinct subtotals) by constructing ONE CVRs for each batch. In
contrast to batch-level comparison audits (BLCAs), this avoids tabulating
batches manually and works even when reporting batches do not correspond to
physically identifiable batches of cards. If the voting system can export
linked CVRs for only some ballot cards, auditors can still use CLCA by
constructing ONE CVRs for the rest of the cards from contest results or batch
subtotals. This obviates the need for ""hybrid"" audits. This works for every
social choice function for which there is a known RLA method, including IRV.
Sample sizes for BPA and ONEAudit using contest totals are comparable. ONEAudit
using batch subtotals has smaller sample sizes than ballot-polling when batches
are much more homogeneous than the election overall. Sample sizes can be much
smaller than for BLCA: A CLCA of the 2022 presidential election in California

ballots statewide, if the reported results are accurate, compared to about

to experience combinatorial growth in the values they can successfully process.
However, it is difficult to design a component that can be used to form
symbolic abstractions and which is adequately overparametrized to learn
arbitrary high-dimensional transformations. I present Graph-based Symbolically
Synthesized Neural Networks (G-SSNNs), a class of neural modules that operate

image is a challenging task due to the different orientations of fingerprints,
noisy backgrounds, and the smaller size of fingertip components. The presence
of slap images in a real-world dataset where one or more fingerprints are
rotated makes it challenging for a biometric recognition system to localize and
label the fingerprints automatically. Improper fingerprint localization and
finger labeling errors lead to poor matching performance. In this paper, we
introduce a method to generate arbitrary angled bounding boxes using a deep
learning-based algorithm that precisely localizes and labels fingerprints from
both axis-aligned and over-rotated slap images. We built a fingerprint
segmentation model named CRFSEG (Clarkson Rotated Fingerprint segmentation
Model) by updating the previously proposed CFSEG model which was based on
traditional Faster R-CNN architecture [21]. CRFSEG improves upon the Faster
R-CNN algorithm with arbitrarily angled bounding boxes that allow the CRFSEG to
perform better in challenging slap images. After training the CRFSEG algorithm
on a new dataset containing slap images collected from both adult and children
subjects, our results suggest that the CRFSEG model was invariant across
different age groups and can handle over-rotated slap images successfully. In
the Combined dataset containing both normal and rotated images of adult and
children subjects, we achieved a matching accuracy of 97.17%, which
outperformed state-of-the-art VeriFinger (94.25%) and NFSEG segmentation

  - Moduli spaces of stable Higgs bundles of coprime rank and degree over a
maximal smooth projective real curve, providing maximal hyper-K\""ahler
examples.
  - If a real variety has non-empty real locus and maximal Hilbert square, then
the variety itself and its Hilbert cube are maximal. This is always the case
for maximal real smooth cubic threefolds, but never the case for maximal real
smooth cubic fourfolds.
  - Punctual Hilbert schemes on a maximal real projective surface with
vanishing first $\mathbb{F}_2$-Betti number and connected real locus, such as
$\mathbb{R}$-rational maximal real surfaces and some generalized Dolgachev
surfaces.
  - Moduli spaces of stable sheaves on the real projective plane, or more

  We also observe that maximality is a motivic property when interpreted as
equivariant formality. Furthermore, any smooth projective real variety
motivated by maximal ones is also maximal.

share a scale-free structure characterized by heterogeneity of heavy-tailed
degree distributions of wealth managers; however, network topologies diverge
across clients from democratic versus autocratic regimes. While generally
robust, scale-free networks are fragile when targeted by attacks on
highly-connected nodes. Our ""knock-out"" experiments pinpoint this vulnerability
to the small group of wealth managers themselves, suggesting that sanctioning
these professional intermediaries may be more effective and efficient in
disrupting dark finance flows than sanctions on their wealthy clients. This
vulnerability is especially pronounced amongst Russian oligarchs, who
concentrate their offshore business in a handful of boutique wealth management
firms. The distinctive patterns we identify suggest a new approach to
sanctions, focused on expert intermediaries to disrupt the finances and
alliances of their wealthy clients. More generally, our research contributes to

powerful tool in many prediction tasks on graphs due to its advantages in model
expressiveness and generalization ability. Most previous SGRL models face
computational issues associated with the high cost of extracting subgraphs for
each training or testing query. Recently, SUREL has been proposed as a new
framework to accelerate SGRL, which samples random walks offline and joins
these walks as subgraphs online for prediction. Due to the reusability of
sampled walks across different queries, SUREL achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both scalability and prediction accuracy. However, SUREL still
suffers from high computational overhead caused by node redundancy in sampled
walks. In this work, we propose a novel framework SUREL+ that upgrades SUREL by
using node sets instead of walks to represent subgraphs. This set-based
representation avoids node duplication by definition, but the sizes of node
sets can be irregular. To address this issue, we design a dedicated sparse data
structure to efficiently store and fast index node sets, and provide a
specialized operator to join them in parallel batches. SUREL+ is modularized to
support multiple types of set samplers, structural features, and neural
encoders to complement the loss of structural information due to the reduction
from walks to sets. Extensive experiments have been performed to validate
SUREL+ in the prediction tasks of links, relation types, and higher-order
patterns. SUREL+ achieves 3-11$\times$ speedups of SUREL while maintaining
comparable or even better prediction performance; compared to other SGRL
baselines, SUREL+ achieves $\sim$20$\times$ speedups and significantly improves

insignificantly changes the vector image drawing style because the structure of
vector primitives differs a lot from pixels. To handle this problem, we
introduce new loss functions. We also develop a new method based on
differentiable rasterization that uses these loss functions and can change the
color and shape parameters of the content image corresponding to the drawing of
the style image. Qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed VectorNST method compared with the state-of-the-art neural style

stylizing vector images, DiffVG. Although the proposed model does not achieve
the quality and smoothness of style transfer between bitmap images, we consider
our work an important early step in this area. VectorNST code and demo service

Unfortunately, these structures are difficult to detect because they are low

which automated methods for tidal feature detection will become mandatory. We
test the ability of a convolutional neural network to reproduce human visual

surface brightness ($\mu_{lim}$ =26-35 mag arcsec$^{-2}$). We obtain
satisfactory results with accuracy, precision and recall values of Acc=0.84,
P=0.72 and R=0.85, respectively, for the test sample. While the accuracy and
precision values are roughly constant for all surface brightness, the recall
(completeness) is significantly affected by image depth. The recovery rate
shows strong dependence on the type of tidal features: we recover all the
images showing shell features and 87% of the tidal streams; these fractions are
below 75% for mergers, tidal tails and bridges. When applied to real HSC

destroying the entire star, and partial TDEs, in which a stellar remnant
survives the interaction, by solving 1-D Fokker-Planck equations. Our rate
estimates are based on a novel definition of the loss cone whose size is
commensurate to the largest radius at which partial disruptions can occur, as
motivated by relativistic hydrodynamical simulations. Our novel approach
unveils two important results. First, partial TDEs can be more abundant than
total disruptions by a factor of a few to a few tens. Second, the rates of
complete stellar disruptions can be overestimated by a factor of a few to a few
tens if one neglects partial TDEs, as we find that many of the events
classified at total disruptions in the standard framework are in fact partial
TDEs. Accounting for partial TDEs is particularly relevant for galaxies
harbouring a nuclear stellar cluster featuring many events coming from the
empty loss cone. Based on these findings, we stress that partial disruptions
should be considered when constraining the luminosity function of TDE flares;
accounting for this may reconcile the theoretically estimated TDE rates with

of galaxies by regulating star formation and by powering galactic outflows.
However, to what extent CRs regulate galaxy formation depends on the coupling
strength of CRs with the ambient plasma and the effective CR transport speed
along the magnetic field. Moreover, both properties sensitively depend on the
CR momentum, which is largely unexplored in three-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations. We perform magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of entire galaxies
with masses ranging from $10^{10}$ to $10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and compare
dynamically coupled CRs in the grey approximation with a spectrally resolved
model that includes CR momenta from $0.1\,\mathrm{GeV}~c^{-1}$ to
$100\,\mathrm{TeV}~c^{-1}$. We find that hadronic cooling of CRs dominates over
Alfv\'{e}n cooling, with the latter emulating CR losses as a result of
streaming of CRs down their pressure gradient. While star formation rates and
galaxy morphologies are only mildly affected by the spectral CR modelling, mass
loading factors of galactic outflows can differ by up to a factor of four in
dwarf galaxies. All simulated low-mass halos ($M=10^{10}$, $10^{11}$, and

is temporally dominated by advection. In contrast, the Milky Way-mass galaxy

CR transport is entirely dominated by diffusion. The effective energy weighted
diffusion coefficients vary by two orders of magnitude from the canonical

The model was solved in the 1960s, before the introduction of large $N$ path

$\delta\ge 2\sqrt{(D-1)/(D-2)}$ for the critical exponent in the scaling
behavior of the distance and the curvature close to the wall. This allows us to
make a connection to the (sharpened) Swampland Distance Conjecture and the

as special cases in our analysis and the whole picture is consistent with
dimensional reduction from ten to $D$ dimensions. An analogous analysis is
performed for a generalized Blumenhagen-Font (BF) model featuring neutral
codimension two ETW-branes where the same lower bound for the scaling parameter
$\delta$ arises.

complete bolometric light curve, in which multiple bumps are identified. None
of the previously proposed models can satisfactorily explain all main
light-curve features, while multiple interactions between the ejecta and
circumstellar material (CSM) may explain the undulating features. The prominent
infrared excess with a blackbody luminosity of $10^7$--$10^8\,L_{sun}$ detected
in SN~2017egm could originate from the emission of either an echo of a
pre-existing dust shell, or newly-formed dust, offering an additional piece of
evidence supporting the ejecta-CSM interaction model. Moreover, our analysis of
deep $Chandra$ observations yields the tightest-ever constraint on the X-ray
emission of an SLSN-I, amounting to an X-ray-to-optical luminosity ratio
$\lesssim 10^{-3}$ at late phases ($\sim100-200\,d$), which could help explore
its close environment and central engine.

polarization signals are strongly sensitive to magnetic fields of strengths on
the order of 50 G, via the action of magneto-optical (MO) effects, and are

X-ray sources are predicted to have important implications for high-redshift
observable signals, such as the hydrogen 21-cm signal from cosmic dawn and the
cosmic X-ray background, their properties are poorly explored, leaving
theoretical models largely uninformed. In this paper we model a population of
X-ray binaries arising from zero metallicity stars. We explore how their
properties depend on the adopted initial mass function (IMF) of primordial
stars, finding a strong effect on their number and X-ray production efficiency.
We also present scaling relations between XRBs and their X-ray emission with
the local star formation rate, which can be used in sub-grid models in
numerical simulations to improve the X-ray feedback prescriptions.
Specifically, we find that the uniformity and strength of the X-ray feedback in
the intergalactic medium is strongly dependant on the IMF. Bottom-heavy IMFs
result in a smoother distribution of XRBs, but have a luminosity orders of
magnitude lower than more top-heavy IMFs. Top-heavy IMFs lead to more spatially
uneven, albeit strong, X-ray emission. An intermediate IMF has a strong X-ray
feedback while sustaining an even emission across the intergalactic medium.
These differences in X-ray feedback could be probed in the future with
measurements of the cosmic dawn 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen, which offers us
a new way of constraining population III IMF.

theory at finite temperature defined on a complex time contour, and consider
also classical, asymptotically AdS solutions (wormholes) with two disconnected
boundaries. In doing this, we revisit the so-called factorization problem, and
its resolution in conventional holography by virtue of some (non-local)
coupling between disconnected boundaries, and we show how in specific contexts,
the averaging proposal by-passes the paradox as well, since it induces a

our understanding of the biases presented in algorithmic content recommendation
systems. As legislators around the world are beginning to consider regulating
the algorithmic systems that drive online platforms, it is critical to ensure
the correctness of these inferred biases. However, as we will show in this
paper, doing so is a challenging task for a variety of reasons related to the
complexity of configuration parameters associated with the audits that gather
data from a specific platform.
  Focusing specifically on YouTube, we show that conducting audits to make
inferences about YouTube's recommendation systems is more methodologically
challenging than one might expect. There are many methodological decisions that
need to be considered in order to obtain scientifically valid results, and each
of these decisions incur costs. For example, should an auditor use (expensive
to obtain) logged-in YouTube accounts while gathering recommendations from the
algorithm to obtain more accurate inferences? We explore the impact of this and
many other decisions and make some startling discoveries about the
methodological choices that impact YouTube's recommendations. Taken all
together, our research suggests auditing configuration compromises that YouTube
auditors and researchers can use to reduce audit overhead, both economically
and computationally, without sacrificing accuracy of their inferences.
Similarly, we also identify several configuration parameters that have a
significant impact on the accuracy of measured inferences and should be
carefully considered.

  welcome!",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  A common way to entangle a pair of quantum memories is via a photonic
entanglement swap. Each of two memories, connected by an optical channel, emits
a photonic qubit entangled with itself, and the photonic qubits undergo an
entanglement swap on a beamsplitter in the middle of the channel. We compare
two choices of encoding of the photonic qubit: the single rail and dual rail.
In the regime of low channel loss, i.e., when the loss of the half-channel
connecting one memory site to the swap site is less than $\approx 6$ dB, the
dual-rail scheme is seen to outperform the single rail scheme. The high-loss
rate asymptote for the dual rail scheme is worse: it scales as $O(\eta)$ ebits
per transmitted photonic mode, as opposed to $O(\sqrt{\eta})$ for the
single-rail scheme, where $\sqrt{\eta}$ is the transmissivity of the half
channel. Considering the following non-idealities: imperfect mode matching at
the swap, carrier-phase mismatch across the interfered photonic qubits from the
two sides, and detector excess noise, we evaluate the explicit density operator
of the heralded two-qubit entangled state. We calculate a lower bound on its
distillable entanglement per copy, and its Fidelity (with the ideal Bell
state). Imperfect swap-visibility results in a constant-factor decrease in the
rate, while excess noise results in a sharp dropoff of distillable entanglement
beyond a certain total channel loss threshold to zero. Despite the single-rail
scheme's better rate-loss scaling, it is more severely affected by excess
noise, and is adversely affected by stochastic carrier-phase mismatch. We study
entanglement distillation on the heralded noisy entangled states. Our
evaluation of the density operator of the entangled state will hopefully pave
the way for more realistic performance evaluations of larger quantum networks
and the development of advanced entanglement distillation schemes.

electromagnetic fields must fluctuate. Even in the vacuum state, the electric
and magnetic fields have a nonzero variance, leading to ubiquitous effects such
as spontaneous emission, the Lamb shift, the Casimir effect, and more. These
""vacuum fluctuations"" have also been harnessed as a source of perfect
randomness, for example to generate perfectly random photonic bits. Despite
these achievements, many potential applications of quantum randomness in fields
such as probabilistic computing rely on controllable probability distributions,
which have not yet been realized on photonic platforms. In this work, we show
that the injection of vacuum-level ""bias"" fields into a multi-stable optical
system enables a controllable source of ""biased"" quantum randomness. We
demonstrate this concept in an optical parametric oscillator (OPO). Ordinarily,
an OPO initiated from the ground state develops a signal field in one of two
degenerate phase states (0 and $\pi$) with equal probability. By injecting bias
pulses which contain less than one photon on average, we control the
probabilities associated with the two output states, leading to the first
controllable photonic probabilistic bit (p-bit). We shed light on the physics
behind this process, showing quantitative agreement between theory and
experiment. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our approach for sensing
sub-photon level fields by showing that our system is sensitive to the temporal
shape of bias field pulses far below the single photon level. Our results
suggest a new platform for the study of stochastic quantum dynamics in

changes depending on the target organ or patient obesity. In practice, it makes
difficult to apply deep learning (DL) based algorithms for image reconstruction
since most of the existing DL-based algorithms are trained to be used for
dedicated X-ray tube energies. In this paper, we propose 1) an energy
flexibility training (EFT) method, which makes a network applicable for data
measured at various X-ray tube energies between two trained energies, and 2) an
effective dual-domain convolutional neural network for image reconstruction.
The proposed network is derived from the regularized version of the primal-dual
hybrid gradient algorithm, so its architecture has an unfolded iterative
dual-domain structure. For validation, we generated datasets from a lab-made
polychromatic X-ray simulator. The proposed method showed promising results not
only at the trained X-ray tube energies but also at untrained X-ray tube
energies outperforming an iterative algorithm and other DL-based algorithms.

impact on asteroid Dimorphos, the satellite of the binary asteroid (65803)
Didymos, at 23:14 UTC on September 26, 2022 as a planetary defense test. DART
was the first hypervelocity impact experiment on an asteroid at size and
velocity scales relevant to planetary defense, intended to validate kinetic
impact as a means of asteroid deflection. Here we report the first
determination of the momentum transferred to an asteroid by kinetic impact.
Based on the change in the binary orbit period, we find an instantaneous
reduction in Dimorphos's along-track orbital velocity component of 2.70 +/-
0.10 mm/s, indicating enhanced momentum transfer due to recoil from ejecta
streams produced by the impact. For a Dimorphos bulk density range of 1,500 to
3,300 kg/m$^3$, we find that the expected value of the momentum enhancement
factor, $\beta$, ranges between 2.2 and 4.9, depending on the mass of
Dimorphos. If Dimorphos and Didymos are assumed to have equal densities of
2,400 kg/m$^3$, $\beta$= 3.61 +0.19/-0.25 (1 $\sigma$). These $\beta$ values
indicate that significantly more momentum was transferred to Dimorphos from the
escaping impact ejecta than was incident with DART. Therefore, the DART kinetic
impact was highly effective in deflecting the asteroid Dimorphos.

the Reynolds number and Nusselt number show evidence of approaching the
diffusion-free scalings of $Re \sim Ra E/Pr$ and $Nu \sim Pr^{-1/2} Ra^{3/2}
E^2$, respectively, where $E$ is the Ekman number and $Pr$ is the Prandtl

large-scale vortices, yield heat and momentum transport scalings that exceed
those of the diffusion-free scaling laws. The Taylor microscale does not vary
significantly with increasing $Ra$, whereas the integral length scale grows
weakly. The computed length scales remain $O(1)$ with respect to the linearly
unstable critical wavenumber and thus remain viscously controlled. We do not
find a point-wise Coriolis-Inertia-Archimedean (CIA) force balance in the
turbulent regime; interior dynamics are instead dominated by horizontal
advection (inertia), vortex stretching (Coriolis) and the vertical pressure
gradient. A secondary, sub-dominant balance between the buoyancy force and the
viscous force occurs in the interior and the ratio of the rms of these two
forces is found to approach unity with increasing $Ra$. This secondary balance
is attributed to the turbulent fluid interior acting as the dominant control on
the heat transport. These findings indicate that a pointwise CIA balance does
not occur in the high Rayleigh number regime of quasi-geostrophic
Rayleigh-B\'enard convection. Instead, simulations are characterized by what
may be termed a \textsl{non-local} CIA balance in which the buoyancy force is
dominant within the thermal boundary layers and is spatially separated from the
interior Coriolis and inertial forces.

revealed that dust rings are common in large, bright disks. The leading
explanation for these structures is dust-trapping in a local gas pressure
maximum, caused by an embedded planet or other dynamical process. Independent
of origin, such dust traps should be stable for many orbits to collect
significant dust. However, ring-like perturbations in gas disks are also known
to trigger the Rossby Wave Instability (RWI). We investigate whether
axisymmetric pressure bumps can simultaneously trap dust and remain stable to
the RWI. The answer depends on the thermodynamic properties of pressure bumps.
For isothermal bumps, dust traps are RWI-stable for widths from ${\sim}1$ to
several gas scale-heights. Adiabatic dust traps are stable over a smaller range
of widths. For temperature bumps with no surface density component, however,
all dust traps tend to be unstable. Smaller values of disk aspect ratio allow
stable dust trapping at lower bump amplitudes and over a larger range of
widths. We also report a new approximate criterion for RWI. Instability occurs
when the radial oscillation frequency is $\lesssim75$\% of the Keplerian
frequency, which differs from the well-known Lovelace necessary (but not
sufficient) criterion for instability. Our results can guide ALMA observations
of molecular gas by constraining the resolution and sensitivity needed to
identify the pressure bumps thought to be responsible for dust rings.

classical combinatorial optimization problem in the transportation community,
which has proven to be very challenging computationally. Due to the complexity

which trade-off solution quality for computational tractability. Among the
various heuristics, a common strategy is problem decomposition, that is, the
reduction of a large-scale problem into a collection of smaller sub-problems,
with spatial and temporal decompositions being two natural approaches. While
spatial decomposition has been successful in certain settings, effective
temporal decomposition has been challenging due to the difficulty of stitching
together the sub-problem solutions across the decomposition boundaries. In this
work, we introduce a novel temporal decomposition scheme for solving a class of
PDPTWs that have narrow time windows, for which it is able to provide both fast

recently in the context of online dial-a-ride problems along with the general
idea of rolling horizon optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first attempt to solve offline PDPTWs using such an approach. To show the
performance and scalability of our framework, we use the optimization of
paratransit services as a motivating example. We compare our results with an
offline heuristic algorithm using Google OR-Tools. In smaller problem
instances, the baseline approach is as competitive as our framework. However,
in larger problem instances, our framework is more scalable and can provide
good solutions to problem instances of varying degrees of difficulty, while the
baseline algorithm often fails to find a feasible solution within comparable

execution, datacenters are going through major changes: (2) storage
dissaggregation in the system infrastructure level and (3) integration of
domain-specific accelerators in the hardware level. Each of these three trends
individually provide significant benefits; however, when combined the benefits
diminish. Specifically, the paper makes the key observation that for serverless
functions, the overhead of accessing dissaggregated persistent storage
overshadows the gains from accelerators. Therefore, to benefit from all these
trends in conjunction, we propose Domain-Specific Computational Storage for
Serverless (DSCS-Serverless). This idea contributes a serverless model that
leverages a programmable accelerator within computational storage to conjugate
the benefits of acceleration and storage disaggregation simultaneously. Our
results with eight applications shows that integrating a comparatively small
accelerator within the storage (DSCS-Serverless) that fits within its power
constrains (15 Watts), significantly outperforms a traditional disaggregated
system that utilizes the NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti GPU (250 Watts). Further, the work
highlights that disaggregation, serverless model, and the limited power budget
for computation in storage require a different design than the conventional
practices of integrating microprocessors and FPGAs. This insight is in contrast
with current practices of designing computational storage that are yet to
address the challenges associated with the shifts in datacenters. In comparison
with two such conventional designs that either use quad-core ARM A57 or a

decide on sharing a particular VNF based on two groups of constraints; the
first group of constraints is common assignment constraints used in the

modeling that satisfies the requirements of slice requests in 5G systems. The
model is tested using standard VNFs and procedures of the 5G system rather than

possible, we can drastically increase the strength of the nudging parameter
without losing stability. Previous methods used old data to nudge the solution
until a new observation was made. In contrast, our method stops nudging the
system almost immediately after an observation is made, allowing the system
relax to the correct physics. We show that this leads to an order-of-magnitude
improvement in the time to convergence in our 3D Navier-Stokes simulations.
Moreover, our simulations indicate that our approach converges at nearly the
same rate as the idealized method of direct replacement of low Fourier modes
proposed by Hayden, Olson, and Titi (HOT). However, our approach can be readily
adapted to non-idealized settings, such as finite element methods, finite
difference methods, etc., since there is no need to access Fourier modes as our
method works for general interpolants. It is in this sense that we think of our
approach as ``second best;'' that is, the ``best'' method would be the direct
replacement of Fourier modes as in HOT, but this idealized approach is
typically not feasible in physically realistic settings. While our method has a
convergence rate that is slightly sub-optimal compared to the idealized method,
it is directly compatible with real-world applications. Moreover, we prove
analytically that these new algorithms are globally well-posed, and converge to
the true solution exponentially fast in time. In addition, we provide the first

constraints of the fading prompt emission and late thermal properties. By
modeling the Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs), we confirm that the
UV-optical emission over 50-60 days was still a smooth blackbody (i.e.,
optically thick) with a high temperature
($T_{\mathrm{BB}}\sim15000\,\mathrm{K}$) and small radius
($R_{\mathrm{BB}}\lesssim1000\,R_\odot$). Additionally, we report for the first
time a break in the bolometric light curve: the thermal luminosity initially
declined at a rate of $L_{\mathrm{BB}}\propto t^{-2.40}$, but faded much faster
at $t^{-3.06}$ after day 13. Re-examining possible late-time power sources, we
disfavor significant contributions from radioactive decay based on the required
$^{56}$Ni mass and the complete lack of UV line blanketing in the HST SEDs. We
argue that the commonly-proposed interaction with circumstellar material may
face significant challenges in explaining the late thermal properties,
particularly the effects of optical depth. Alternatively, we find that
continuous outflow/wind driven by a central engine can still reasonably explain
the combination of receding photosphere, optically thick and rapid fading
emission, as well as the intermediate-width lines. However, the rapid fading
may have further implications on the power output of the engine and structure
of the wind. Our findings may support the hypothesis that AT 2018cow and other

observations at $\sim$2-3 years post-explosion revealed an exceptionally blue
($L_\nu\propto \nu^{1.99}$) underlying source with relatively stable optical
brightness, fading in the NUV was observed at year 4, indicating flattening in
the spectrum (to $L_\nu\propto \nu^{1.64}$). The resulting spectral energy
distributions can be described by an extremely hot but small blackbody, and the
fading may be intrinsic (cooling) or extrinsic (increased absorption).
Considering possible scenarios and explanations, we disfavor significant
contributions from stellar sources and dust formation based on the observed
color and brightness. By comparing the expected power and the observed

circumstellar material as well as magnetar spin down with
$B\sim10^{15}\,\mathrm{G}$ as possible power sources, though we cannot rule out

the color, brightness, and evolution of the underlying source. However, a major
uncertainty in this scenario is the mass of the central black hole (BH), as
both stellar-mass and intermediate-mass BHs face notable challenges that cannot
be explained by our simple disk model, and further observations and theoretical
works are needed to fully constrain the nature of this underlying source.

capability that is often difficult to do accurately even though inertial
measurement units (IMUs) can observe absolute roll and pitch with respect to
gravity. Accelerometer biases and scale factor errors from the IMU's initial
calibration are often the major source of inaccuracies when aligning the
robot's odometry frame with the inertial frame, especially for low-grade IMUs.
Practically, one would simultaneously estimate the true gravity vector,
accelerometer biases, and scale factor to improve measurement quality but these
quantities are not observable unless the IMU is sufficiently excited. While
several methods estimate accelerometer bias and gravity, they do not explicitly
address the observability issue nor do they estimate scale factor. We present a
fixed-lag factor-graph-based estimator to address both of these issues. In
addition to estimating accelerometer scale factor, our method mitigates limited
observability by optimizing over a time window an order of magnitude larger
than existing methods with significantly lower computational burden. The
proposed method, which estimates accelerometer intrinsics and gravity
separately from the other states, is enabled by a novel, velocity-agnostic
measurement model for intrinsics and gravity, as well as a new method for
gravity vector optimization on S2. Accurate IMU state prediction,
gravity-alignment, and roll/pitch drift correction are experimentally
demonstrated on public and self-collected datasets in diverse environments.

cooperate with a clone with high probability, even at high noise levels; and we
want it to be cooperation-inducing, i.e., optimal play against it should entail
cooperating with high probability. We show that we can guarantee these

which is the result of a partial symplectic reduction. The associated momentum
map is the electromagnetic memory in the abelian theory, or a nonlinear,
gauge-equivariant, generalization thereof in the nonabelian case.
  This result follows from an application of Hamiltonian reduction by stages,
enabled by the existence of a natural normal subgroup of the gauge group on a
null codimension-1 submanifold with boundaries. The first stage is coisotropic
reduction of the Gauss constraint, and it yields a symplectic extension of the
Ashtekar-Streubel phase space (up to a covering). Hamiltonian reduction of the
residual gauge action leads to the fully-reduced phase space of the theory.
This is a Poisson manifold, whose symplectic leaves, called superselection
sectors, are labelled by the (gauge classes of the generalized) electric flux
across the boundary.
  In this framework, the Ashtekar-Streubel phase space arises as an
intermediate reduction stage that enforces the superselection of the electric
flux at only one of the two boundary components. These results provide a
natural, purely Hamiltonian, explanation of the existence of soft symmetries as
a byproduct of partial symplectic reduction, as well as a motivation for the
expected decomposition of the quantum Hilbert space of states into irreducible
representations labelled by the Casimirs of the Poisson structure on the
reduced phase space.

is a bounded $p \times p$ positive definite deterministic matrix representing
the population covariance structure, $X$ is a $p \times n$ random matrix
containing either independent columns sampled from the unit sphere in
$\mathbb{R}^p$ or i.i.d. centered entries with variance $n^{-1},$ and $D$ is a
diagonal random matrix containing i.i.d. entries and independent of $X.$ Such a
model finds important applications in statistics and machine learning.
  In this paper, assuming that $p$ and $n$ are comparably large, we prove that
the extreme edge eigenvalues of $Q$ can have several types of distributions
depending on $\Sigma$ and $D$ asymptotically. These distributions include:
Gumbel, Fr\'echet, Weibull, Tracy-Widom, Gaussian and their mixtures. On the
one hand, when the random variables in $D$ have unbounded support, the edge
eigenvalues of $Q$ can have either Gumbel or Fr\'echet distribution depending
on the tail decay property of $D.$ On the other hand, when the random variables
in $D$ have bounded support, under some mild regularity assumptions on
$\Sigma,$ the edge eigenvalues of $Q$ can exhibit Weibull, Tracy-Widom,
Gaussian or their mixtures. Based on our theoretical results, we consider two
important applications. First, we propose some statistics and procedure to
detect and estimate the possible spikes for elliptically distributed data.
Second, in the context of a factor model, by using the multiplier bootstrap
procedure via selecting the weights in $D,$ we propose a new algorithm to infer

also confirm the accuracy and powerfulness of our proposed methods and
illustrate better performance compared to some existing methods in the

specific protein target \textit{in silico}. Recently, the inclusion of 3D
structures during targeted drug design shows superior performance to other
target-free models as the atomic interaction in the 3D space is explicitly
modeled. However, current 3D target-aware models either rely on the voxelized
atom densities or the autoregressive sampling process, which are not
equivariant to rotation or easily violate geometric constraints resulting in
unrealistic structures. In this work, we develop a 3D equivariant diffusion
model to solve the above challenges. To achieve target-aware molecule design,
our method learns a joint generative process of both continuous atom
coordinates and categorical atom types with a SE(3)-equivariant network.
Moreover, we show that our model can serve as an unsupervised feature extractor
to estimate the binding affinity under proper parameterization, which provides
an effective way for drug screening. To evaluate our model, we propose a
comprehensive framework to evaluate the quality of sampled molecules from
different dimensions. Empirical studies show our model could generate molecules
with more realistic 3D structures and better affinities towards the protein
targets, and improve binding affinity ranking and prediction without
retraining.

present one case study on a simulated trust-based table-clearing task and
replicate past results that relied on custom models. Next, we conduct a new

planning with a LLM-based human model can achieve gains over a basic myopic

viscosity, are quantities of prime interest in statistical physics. At the
macroscopic level, transport coefficients relate an external forcing of
magnitude $\eta$, with $\eta \ll 1$, acting on the system to an average
response expressed through some steady-state flux. In practice, steady-state
averages involved in the linear response are computed as time averages over a
realization of some stochastic differential equation. Variance reduction
techniques are of paramount interest in this context, as the linear response is
scaled by a factor of $1/\eta$, leading to large statistical error. One way to
limit the increase in the variance is to allow for larger values of $\eta$ by
increasing the range of values of the forcing for which the nonlinear part of
the response is sufficiently small. In theory, one can add an extra forcing to
the physical perturbation of the system, called synthetic forcing, as long as
this extra forcing preserves the invariant measure of the reference system. The
aim is to find synthetic perturbations allowing to reduce the nonlinear part of
the response as much as possible. We present a mathematical framework for

mission-critical tasks, they are usually implemented using Micro-Controller
Units (MCUs) that lack security mechanisms on par with those available to
general-purpose computers, making them more susceptible to remote exploits that
could corrupt their software integrity. Motivated by this problem, prior work
has proposed techniques to remotely assess the trustworthiness of embedded MCU
software. Among them, Control Flow Attestation (CFA) enables remote detection
of runtime abuses that illegally modify the program's control flow during
execution.
  Despite these advances, current CFA methods share a fundamental limitation:
they preclude interrupts during the execution of the software operation being
attested. Simply put, existing CFA techniques are insecure unless interrupts
are disabled on the MCU. On the other hand, we argue that the lack of
interruptability can obscure CFA usefulness, as most embedded applications
depend on interrupts to process asynchronous events in real-time.
  To address this limitation, we propose Interrupt-Safe Control Flow
Attestation (ISC-FLAT): a CFA technique that is compatible with existing MCUs
and enables interrupt handling without compromising the authenticity of CFA
reports. Similar to other CFA techniques that do not require customized
hardware modifications, ISC-FLAT leverages a Trusted Execution Environment

generate unforgeable CFA reports without precluding applications from
processing interrupts. We implement a fully functional ISC-FLAT prototype on

signatures of translocating polymers in magnetic fields induced by ionic
currents through membrane nanopores. Within the framework of a previously
introduced charge transport theory, we evaluate the magnetic field signals
generated by voltage- and pressure-driven DNA translocation events in
monovalent salt solutions. Our formalism reveals that in voltage-driven
transport, the translocating polymer suppresses the induced magnetic field via
the steric blockage of the ion current through the mid-pore. In the case of
pressure-driven transport, the magnetic field reduction by translocation
originates from the negative electrokinetic contribution of the anionic DNA
surface charges to the streaming current predominantly composed of salt
cations. The magnitude of the corresponding field signals is located in the
nano-Tesla range covered by the resolution of the magnetoelectric sensors able
to detect magnetic fields down to the pico-Tesla range. This suggests that the
integration of magnetic field detection techniques into the current
biosequencing approaches can complement efficiently the conventional biosensing
strategies employing ionic current readouts with high susceptibility to
background noise.

the trainees to follow a desired trajectory provided by expert surgeons.
Learning from demonstration based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) was used
to generate the desired trajectory. User studies were also conducted to verify
the effectiveness of our proposed TIMS, comparing users' performance with and

numbers that represent distances between pairs of points in $E$. This paper
studies sparse (less than full-dimensional) Borel sets in $\mathbb R^d$, $d
\geq 2$ with a focus on properties of their distance sets. Our results are of
four types. First, we generalize a classical result of Steinhaus (1920) to
Borel sets $E \subseteq [0,1]^d$ with $s$-dimensional Hausdorff content larger
than $(1 - \rho)$, for small $\rho > 0$ and $s$ close to $d$. For such sets, we
show that $\Delta(E) \supseteq [a, b]$, where $0<a<b$ depend only on $d$ and
$\rho$. This leads to our second result, a quantitative formulation of a
theorem of Mattila and Sj$\ddot{\text{o}}$lin (1999). For an arbitrary Borel
set $E \subseteq [0,1]^d$ of large Hausdorff dimension, we show that
$\Delta(E)$ contains a union of intervals whose lengths are dictated by cubes
where $E$ holds high density. This structure theorem in turn yields a tool for
identifying abundance of distances; this is the third contribution of this
article. It allows us to formulate a size property of a set that guarantees all
sufficiently large distances, generalizing earlier work of Bourgain (1986). It
can also be used to construct examples of totally disconnected sparse sets with
this property. Finally, we explore special features of $\Delta(E)$ if $E$ is
assumed to have certain structural regularity in addition to large Hausdorff
dimension. The additional regularity is harnessed via $L^2$-Fourier asymptotics
of measures supported on $E$. Applications of this phenomenon give new
information on $\Delta(E)$ when $E$ is locally uniformly $s$-dimensional and
quasi-regular, in the terminology of Strichartz (1990). A number of new
examples, counterexamples and open problems are discussed.

human dermal fibroblasts cultured on liquid crystal elastomers can exhibit an
increase in orientational alignment over time, accompanied by cell
proliferation, under the influence of the weak guidance of a molecularly
aligned substrate. However, a comprehensive understanding of how this order
arises remains largely unknown. This knowledge gap may be attributed, in part,
to a scarcity of mechanistic models that can capture the temporal progression
of the complex nonequilibrium dynamics during the cellular alignment process.
To fill in this gap, we develop a hybrid procedure that utilizes statistical
learning approaches to select individual-level features for extending the
state-of-art physics models. The maximum likelihood estimator of the model was
derived and implemented in computationally scalable algorithms for model
calibration and simulation. By including these features, such as the
non-Gaussian, anisotropic fluctuations, and limiting alignment interaction only
to neighboring cells with the same velocity direction, this model is able to
reproduce system-level parameters: the temporal progression of the velocity
orientational order parameters and the variability of velocity vectors. Unlike
other data-driven approaches, we do not rely on a loss function to tune model
parameters to match these system-level characteristics. Furthermore, we develop
a computational toolbox for automating model construction and calibration that
can be applied to other systems of active matter.

end in a positive outcome, is a recurrent process improvement goal. At runtime,
there are often certain actions (a.k.a. treatments) that workers may execute to
lift the probability that a case ends in a positive outcome. For example, in a
loan origination process, a possible treatment is to issue multiple loan offers
to increase the probability that the customer takes a loan. Each treatment has
a cost. Thus, when defining policies for prescribing treatments to cases,
managers need to consider the net gain of the treatments. Also, the effect of a
treatment varies over time: treating a case earlier may be more effective than
later in a case. This paper presents a prescriptive monitoring method that
automates this decision-making task. The method combines causal inference and
reinforcement learning to learn treatment policies that maximize the net gain.
The method leverages a conformal prediction technique to speed up the
convergence of the reinforcement learning mechanism by separating cases that
are likely to end up in a positive or negative outcome, from uncertain cases.
An evaluation on two real-life datasets shows that the proposed method
outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline.

network, which achieves 3D detection based on BEV representation without
calibration parameters and additional depth supervision. Specifically, we
utilize two multi-layer perceptrons for decoupling the features from
perspective view to front view and birdeye view under boxes-induced foreground
supervision. Then, a cross-view feature fusion module matches features from
orthogonal views according to similarity and conducts BEV feature enhancement
with front view features. Experimental results on DAIR-V2X demonstrate that CBR
achieves acceptable performance without any camera parameters and is naturally
not affected by calibration noises. We hope CBR can serve as a baseline for
future research addressing practical challenges of infrastructure perception.

extended the results to handle the case of Poincar\'e inequalities. In this

diffusions and LMC under weak Poincar\'e inequalities that are satisfied by a
large class of densities including polynomially-decaying heavy-tailed densities
(i.e., Cauchy-type). Our results explicitly quantify the effect of the
initializer on the performance of the LMC algorithm. In particular, we show
that as the tail goes from sub-Gaussian, to sub-exponential, and finally to
Cauchy-like, the dependency on the initial error goes from being logarithmic,

transition is in particular unavoidable as demonstrated by our lower bounds,

detection. Recent advanced multi-modal methods mainly perform global fusion,
where image features and point cloud features are fused across the whole scene.
Such practice lacks fine-grained region-level information, yielding suboptimal
fusion performance. In this paper, we present the novel Local-to-Global fusion
network (LoGoNet), which performs LiDAR-camera fusion at both local and global
levels. Concretely, the Global Fusion (GoF) of LoGoNet is built upon previous
literature, while we exclusively use point centroids to more precisely
represent the position of voxel features, thus achieving better cross-modal
alignment. As to the Local Fusion (LoF), we first divide each proposal into
uniform grids and then project these grid centers to the images. The image
features around the projected grid points are sampled to be fused with
position-decorated point cloud features, maximally utilizing the rich
contextual information around the proposals. The Feature Dynamic Aggregation
(FDA) module is further proposed to achieve information interaction between
these locally and globally fused features, thus producing more informative
multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both Waymo Open Dataset (WOD)

driven motional signals. With the numerical calculation of the dynamic
temperature of the optically-levitated nanoparticle, the long-term dynamic net
charge on the nanoparticle can be tracked. This method can achieve an accurate
measurement with the accuracy of better than 5% at thermal equilibrium
pressures of more than 10 mbar and accuracy of ~20% till 3 mbar, where the net
charge barely changes spontaneously, and nonlinearities in the levitated
oscillator is relatively small. As the net charge is integer discrete, the
method provides nearly completely accurate measurements of nanoparticles with
few charges. The result can be applied to improve the measurement accuracy for
mass and density through iteration and this method provides a way toward
non-contact characterization of aerology, space dust, etc.

to industrial production. With the prevalent deployment of the Industrial
Internet of Things (IIoT), an enormous amount of time series data is collected

However, it is most challenging to deploy complex deep learning models such as
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on these memory-constrained IIoT devices
embedded with microcontrollers (MCUs). To alleviate the memory constraints of
MCUs, we propose a novel framework named Tiny Anomaly Detection (TinyAD) to
efficiently facilitate onboard inference of CNNs for real-time anomaly
detection. First, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of depthwise separable
CNNs and regular CNNs for anomaly detection and find that the depthwise
separable convolution operation can reduce the model size by 50-90% compared
with the traditional CNNs. Then, to reduce the peak memory consumption of CNNs,
we explore two complementary strategies, in-place, and patch-by-patch memory
rescheduling, and integrate them into a unified framework. The in-place method
decreases the peak memory of the depthwise convolution by sparing a temporary
buffer to transfer the activation results, while the patch-by-patch method
further reduces the peak memory of layer-wise execution by slicing the input
data into corresponding receptive fields and executing in order. Furthermore,
by adjusting the dimension of convolution filters, these strategies apply to
both univariate time series and multidomain time series features. Extensive
experiments on real-world industrial datasets show that our framework can
reduce peak memory consumption by 2-5x with negligible computation overhead.

fabrication of a large deflection fiber Bragg grating (FBG) shape sensor
embedded within the lumens inside the walls of a CDM with a large instrument

and social benefits. As an essential operator, ""insertion operator"" has been
extensively studied over static road networks. When a new request appears, the
insertion operator is used to find the optimal positions of a worker's current
route to insert the origin and destination of this request and minimize the
travel time of this worker. Previous works study how to conduct the insertion
operation efficiently in static road networks, however, in reality, the route
planning should be addressed by considering the dynamic traffic scenario (i.e.,
a time-dependent road network). Unfortunately, existing solutions to the
insertion operator become in efficient under this setting. Thus, this paper
studies the insertion operator over time-dependent road networks. Specially, to
reduce the high time complexity $O(n^3)$ of existing solution, we calculate the
compound travel time functions along the route to speed up the calculation of
the travel time between vertex pairs belonging to the route, as a result time
complexity of an insertion can be reduced to $O(n^2)$. Finally, we further
improve the method to a linear-time insertion algorithm by showing that it only
needs $O(1)$ time to find the best position of current route to insert the

supply for a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) system. Its design can be
optimised for the best performance; however, the optimal design depends on the
input vibration, e.g. acceleration of a bridge due to wind loads and passing
traffic. In previous studies, we have shown that optimal design tunes to some
predominant frequency of the signal spectrum. However, our previous study was
limited to a single location of a PEH on a bridge. In this work, we extend the
rigorous optimisation framework to include the effect of the PEH's location.
The optimisation framework uses the PEH plate model discretised by IsoGeometric
Analysis (IGA) and coupled with the Particle Swarm Optimisation algorithm to
find the designs with maximum energy outputs for many acceleration histories,
extracted from the recorded dynamic response data of a real cable-stayed bridge
in Australia. Then, clustering is performed to find several best candidates for
the entire bridge. An additional study is performed to quantify the effect of
traffic intensity on the produced energy. It is shown that variation in traffic
volume throughout the 24hr time window leads to variation in optimal PEH
designs. The study concludes the impact of location and traffic on energy
harvesting by identifying the optimal PEH design and placement throughout the
bridge structure. The results indicate that the key factors of maximising
energy harvesting efficiency are related to the input excitation and the mode
of vibration being excited. The position of maximum displacement in the
vibration mode corresponds to the best location for energy harvesting. Also,
the change in traffic intensity affects the amount of convertible mechanical
energy and also directs the fundamental frequency of a PEH to shift within a
specific range of frequencies to achieve the highest energy conversion.

parameterized as a coherent pebble mass flux, sometimes being constant in space
and time. Here we solve the dust advection and diffusion within viciously
evolving protoplanetary disks to determine the pebble supply self-consistently.
The pebbles are then accreted by planetesimals interacting with the gas disk
via gas drag and gravitational torque. The pebble supply is variable with space
and decays with time quickly, with a pebble flux below 10 $M_\oplus$ Myr$^{-1}$
after 1 Myr in our models. As a result, only when massive planetesimals ($>$

for lung cancer is to diagnose the pulmonary nodules in the early stage, which
is usually accomplished with the aid of thoracic computed tomography (CT). As
deep learning thrives, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been
introduced into pulmonary nodule detection to help doctors in this
labor-intensive task and demonstrated to be very effective. However, the
current pulmonary nodule detection methods are usually domain-specific, and
cannot satisfy the requirement of working in diverse real-world scenarios. To
address this issue, we propose a slice grouped domain attention (SGDA) module
to enhance the generalization capability of the pulmonary nodule detection
networks. This attention module works in the axial, coronal, and sagittal
directions. In each direction, we divide the input feature into groups, and for
each group, we utilize a universal adapter bank to capture the feature
subspaces of the domains spanned by all pulmonary nodule datasets. Then the
bank outputs are combined from the perspective of domain to modulate the input
group. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDA enables substantially better
multi-domain pulmonary nodule detection performance compared with the
state-of-the-art multi-domain learning methods.

(i.e., accuracy) of neural networks trained with an imbalanced dataset are
known to vary a lot from category to category. The convention in long-tailed
recognition is to manually split all categories into three subsets and report
the average accuracy within each subset. We argue that under such an evaluation
setting, some categories are inevitably sacrificed. On one hand, focusing on
the average accuracy on a balanced test set incurs little penalty even if some
worst performing categories have zero accuracy. On the other hand, classes in
the ""Few"" subset do not necessarily perform worse than those in the ""Many"" or
""Medium"" subsets. We therefore advocate to focus more on improving the lowest
recall among all categories and the harmonic mean of all recall values.
Specifically, we propose a simple plug-in method that is applicable to a wide
range of methods. By simply re-training the classifier of an existing
pre-trained model with our proposed loss function and using an optional
ensemble trick that combines the predictions of the two classifiers, we achieve
a more uniform distribution of recall values across categories, which leads to
a higher harmonic mean accuracy while the (arithmetic) average accuracy is
still high. The effectiveness of our method is justified on widely used
benchmark datasets.

example images cannot always be prepared. Besides, there can be images with
rare characteristics that make it difficult to find similar example images,
which we call isolated samples. Here, we introduce a novel sketch-based medical
image retrieval (SBMIR) system that enables users to find images of interest
without example images. The key idea lies in feature decomposition of medical
images, whereby the entire feature of a medical image can be decomposed into
and reconstructed from normal and abnormal features. By extending this idea,
our SBMIR system provides an easy-to-use two-step graphical user interface:
users first select a template image to specify a normal feature and then draw a
semantic sketch of the disease on the template image to represent an abnormal
feature. Subsequently, it integrates the two kinds of input to construct a
query vector and retrieves reference images with the closest reference vectors.
Using two datasets, ten healthcare professionals with various clinical
backgrounds participated in the user test for evaluation. As a result, our
SBMIR system enabled users to overcome previous challenges, including image
retrieval based on fine-grained image characteristics, image retrieval without
example images, and image retrieval for isolated samples. Our SBMIR system
achieves flexible medical image retrieval on demand, thereby expanding the

a single rod, to manipulate the object. Compared to the grasping method, such
an end effector is compact and flexible, and hence it can perform tasks in a
constrained workspace; As a trade-off, it has relatively few degrees of freedom
(DoFs), resulting in an under-actuation problem with complex constraints for
planning and control. This paper proposes a new non-prehensile manipulation
method for the task of object retrieval in cluttered environments, using a
rod-like pusher. Specifically, a candidate trajectory in a cluttered
environment is first generated with an improved Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree
(RRT) planner; Then, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme is applied to
stabilize the slider's poses through necessary contact with obstacles.
Different from existing methods, the proposed approach is with the
contact-aware feature, which enables the synthesized effect of active removal
of obstacles, avoidance behavior, and switching contact face for improved
dexterity. Hence both the feasibility and efficiency of the task are greatly
promoted. The performance of the proposed method is validated in a planar
object retrieval task, where the target object, surrounded by many fixed or
movable obstacles, is manipulated and isolated. Both simulation and
experimental results are presented.

usually show compact, highly-sheared polarity inversion lines (PILs). A
scenario named as collisional-shearing is proposed to explain the formation of
this type of PILs and the subsequent eruptions, which stresses the role of
collision and shearing induced by relative motions of different bipoles in
their emergence. However, in observations, if not considering the evolution
stage of the ARs, about one third of the ARs that produce large solar eruptions
govern a spot-spot type configuration. In this work, we studied the full
evolution of an emerging AR, which owned a spot-spot type configuration when
producing a major eruption, to explore the possible evolution gap between
collisional shearing process in flux emergence and the formation of the
spot-spot type, eruption-producing AR. It was found that the AR was formed
through three bipoles emerged sequentially. The bipoles were arranged in
parallel on the photosphere, so that the AR exhibited an overall large bipole
configuration. In the fast emergence phase of the AR, the shearing gradually
occurred due to the proper motions of the polarities, but no significant
collision occurred due to the parallel arrangement of the bipoles. Nor did the
large eruption occur. After the fast emergence, one large positive polarity
started decay. Its dispersion led to the collision to a negative polarity which
belonged to another bipole. A huge hot channel was formed through precursor
flarings around the collision region. The hot channel erupted later,
accompanied by an M7.3-class flare. The results suggest that in the spot-spot
type AR, along with the shearing induced by the proper motions of the
polarities, a decay process may lead to the collision of the polarities,
driving the subsequent eruptions.

convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, most existing methods are still
challenged by heavy compute cost and biased filter selection. Moreover, most
designs for filter evaluation miss interpretability due to the lack of
appropriate theoretical guidance. In this paper, we propose a novel filter
pruning method which evaluates filters in a interpretable, multi-persepective
and data-free manner. We introduce information capacity, a metric that
represents the amount of information contained in a filter. Based on the
interpretability and validity of information entropy, we propose to use that as
a quantitative index of information quantity. Besides, we experimently show
that the obvious correlation between the entropy of the feature map and the
corresponding filter, so as to propose an interpretable, data-driven scheme to
measure the information capacity of the filter. Further, we introduce
information independence, another metric that represents the correlation among
differrent filters. Consequently, the least impotant filters, which have less
information capacity and less information independence, will be pruned. We
evaluate our method on two benchmarks using multiple representative CNN
architectures, including VGG-16 and ResNet. On CIFAR-10, we reduce 71.9% of

generator $L$ on a finite state space $\mathcal{X}$, we develop three
structured and inter-related approaches to generate new reversiblizations from
$L$. The first approach hinges on a geometric perspective, in which we view
reversiblizations as projections onto the space of $\pi$-reversible generators
under suitable information divergences such as $f$-divergences. Different
choices of $f$ allow us to recover almost all known reversiblizations while at
the same time unravel and generate new reversiblizations. Along the way, we
give interesting geometric results such as bisection properties, Pythagorean
identities, parallelogram laws and a Markov chain counterpart of the
arithmetic-geometric-harmonic mean inequality governing these
reversiblizations. This also motivates us to introduce the notion of
information centroids of a sequence of Markov chains and to give conditions for
their existence and uniqueness. Building upon the first approach, we view
reversiblizations as generalized means in the second approach, and construct
new reversiblizations via different natural notions of generalized means such
as the Cauchy mean or the dual mean. In the third approach, we combine the
recently introduced locally-balanced Markov processes framework and the notion
of convex $*$-conjugate in the study of $f$-divergence. The latter offers a
rich source of balancing functions to generate new reversiblizations.

number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). We observe that such reduction in
FLOPs, however, does not necessarily lead to a similar level of reduction in
latency. This mainly stems from inefficiently low floating-point operations per
second (FLOPS). To achieve faster networks, we revisit popular operators and
demonstrate that such low FLOPS is mainly due to frequent memory access of the
operators, especially the depthwise convolution. We hence propose a novel
partial convolution (PConv) that extracts spatial features more efficiently, by
cutting down redundant computation and memory access simultaneously. Building
upon our PConv, we further propose FasterNet, a new family of neural networks,
which attains substantially higher running speed than others on a wide range of
devices, without compromising on accuracy for various vision tasks. For
example, on ImageNet-1k, our tiny FasterNet-T0 is $2.8\times$, $3.3\times$, and
$2.4\times$ faster than MobileViT-XXS on GPU, CPU, and ARM processors,

of superconducting qubits relies on parametric amplifiers at the millikelvin
stage. However, parametric amplifiers are challenging to scale beyond hundreds
of qubits owing to practical size and power limitations. Nanobolometers have a
multitude of properties that are advantageous for scalability and have recently
shown sensitivity and speed promising for qubit readout, but such thermal
detectors have not been demonstrated for this purpose. In this work, we utilize
an ultrasensitive bolometer in place of a parametric amplifier to
experimentally demonstrate single-shot qubit readout. With a readout duration
of $13.9~\mu\mathrm{s}$, we achieve a single-shot fidelity of 0.618 which is
mainly limited by the energy relaxation time of the qubit, $T_1 =
28~\mu\mathrm{s}$. Without the $T_1$ errors, we find the fidelity to be 0.927.
In the future, high-fidelity single-shot readout may be achieved by
straightforward improvements to the chip design and experimental setup, and
perhaps most interestingly by the change of the bolometer absorber material to
reduce the readout time to the hundred-nanosecond level and beyond.

Mapping underwater caves is a time-consuming, labor-intensive, and hazardous

challenge lies in vision-based estimation in the complete absence of ambient
light, which results in constantly moving shadows due to the motion of the
camera-light setup. Thus, detecting and following the caveline as navigation
guidance is paramount for robots in autonomous cave mapping missions. In this
paper, we present a computationally light caveline detection model based on a
novel Vision Transformer (ViT)-based learning pipeline. We address the problem
of scarce annotated training data by a weakly supervised formulation where the
learning is reinforced through a series of noisy predictions from intermediate
sub-optimal models. We validate the utility and effectiveness of such weak

good generalization performance while offering 10+ FPS on single-board (Jetson

assess and compare multiple skin lesions of the same patient concurrently to
gather contextual information regarding the patterns, and abnormality of the
skin. So far this concurrent multi-image comparative method has not been
explored by existing deep learning-based schemes. In this paper, based on
contextual image feature fusion (CIFF), a deep neural network (CIFF-Net) is
proposed, which integrates patient-level contextual information into the
traditional approaches for improved Melanoma diagnosis by concurrent
multi-image comparative method. The proposed multi-kernel self attention (MKSA)
module offers better generalization of the extracted features by introducing
multi-kernel operations in the self attention mechanisms. To utilize both self
attention and contextual feature-wise attention, an attention guided module
named contextual feature fusion (CFF) is proposed that integrates extracted
features from different contextual images into a single feature vector.
Finally, in comparative contextual feature fusion (CCFF) module, primary and
contextual features are compared concurrently to generate comparative features.
Significant improvement in performance has been achieved on the ISIC-2020
dataset over the traditional approaches that validate the effectiveness of the
proposed contextual learning scheme.

expectation of the smallest eigenvalue of a stochastic convection-diffusion

finite element (FE) discretizations of the eigenvalue problem on a hierarchy of
increasingly finer meshes. For the discretized, algebraic eigenproblems we use
both the Rayleigh quotient (RQ) iteration and implicitly restarted Arnoldi
(IRA), providing an analysis of the cost in each case. By studying the variance
on each level and adapting classical FE error bounds to the stochastic setting,
we are able to bound the total error of our MLMC estimator and provide a
complexity analysis. As expected, the complexity bound for our MLMC estimator
is superior to plain Monte Carlo. To improve the efficiency of the MLMC
further, we exploit the hierarchy of meshes and use coarser approximations as
starting values for the eigensolvers on finer ones. To improve the stability of
the MLMC method for convection-dominated problems, we employ two additional
strategies. First, we consider the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin
formulation of the discrete eigenvalue problem, which allows us to start the
MLMC method on coarser meshes than is possible with standard FEs. Second, we
apply a homotopy method to obtain the eigenvalue of the convection-diffusion
operator by following a continuous path starting from the pure diffusion
operator. We provide detailed numerical results comparing our different
strategies to demonstrate the practical feasibility of the MLMC method in
different use cases. The results support our complexity analysis and further
demonstrate the superiority over plain Monte Carlo in all cases.

downstream tasks require different invariances for their best performance, so
the optimal choice of augmentations for SSL depends on the target task. In this
paper, we aim to learn self-supervised features that generalize well across a
variety of downstream tasks (e.g., object classification, detection and
instance segmentation) without knowing any task information beforehand. We do
so by Masked Augmentation Subspace Training (or MAST) to encode in the single
feature space the priors from different data augmentations in a factorized way.
Specifically, we disentangle the feature space into separate subspaces, each
induced by a learnable mask that selects relevant feature dimensions to model
invariance to a specific augmentation. We show the success of MAST in jointly
capturing generalizable priors from different augmentations, using both unique
and shared features across the subspaces. We further show that MAST benefits
from uncertainty modeling to reweight ambiguous samples from strong
augmentations that may cause similarity mismatch in each subspace. Experiments
demonstrate that MAST consistently improves generalization on various
downstream tasks, while being task-agnostic and efficient during SSL. We also
provide interesting insights about how different augmentations are related and

Cross-Entropy (CE) loss function is insufficient to learn transferable targeted
adversarial examples due to the issue of vanishing gradient. In this work, we
provide a comprehensive investigation of the CE loss function and find that the
logit margin between the targeted and untargeted classes will quickly obtain
saturation in CE, which largely limits the transferability. Therefore, in this
paper, we devote to the goal of continually increasing the logit margin along
the optimization to deal with the saturation issue and propose two simple and
effective logit calibration methods, which are achieved by downscaling the
logits with a temperature factor and an adaptive margin, respectively. Both of
them can effectively encourage optimization to produce a larger logit margin
and lead to higher transferability. Besides, we show that minimizing the cosine

downscaling logits via L2-normalization. Experiments conducted on the ImageNet

  dynamic environments using robust control","15 pages, 7 figures",,,,"quant-ph physics.atom-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum sensors based on matter-wave interferometry have the potential to
revolutionize navigation, civil engineering, and Earth observation. However,
operating these devices in real-world environments is challenging due to
external interference, platform noise, and constraints on size, weight, and
power. Consequently, the advantages of choosing a quantum sensor over
conventional alternatives are typically lost when transitioning from the
laboratory to the field. Here we experimentally demonstrate that tailored light
pulses designed and implemented in software using robust control techniques
mitigate significant sources of performance degradation in an
atom-interferometric accelerometer. To mimic the effect of unpredictable
lateral platform motion, we apply laser-intensity noise that varies up to 20%
from pulse-to-pulse, and demonstrate that our robust control solution maintains
performant sensing, while the utility of conventional pulses collapses. By
measuring local gravity, we show that these robust pulse sequences preserve the
interferometer scale factor and improve its precision by $10\times$ in the
presence of the applied laser intensity noise. We further validate these
enhancements by measuring applied accelerations over a $200~\mu g$ range up to
$21\times$ more precisely for the largest applied noise. This shows for the
first time that software-defined quantum sensing can deliver useful performance
in dynamic environments inherent to onboard applications where conventional
operation is severely degraded, providing a pathway to augment the performance
of current and next-generation atom inertial sensors in real-world settings.

In

MOtion, Scene and Object decomposition framework (MOSO) for video prediction,
consisting of MOSO-VQVAE and MOSO-Transformer. In the first stage, MOSO-VQVAE
decomposes a previous video clip into the motion, scene and object components,
and represents them as distinct groups of discrete tokens. Then, in the second
stage, MOSO-Transformer predicts the object and scene tokens of the subsequent
video clip based on the previous tokens and adds dynamic motion at the token
level to the generated object and scene tokens. Our framework can be easily
extended to unconditional video generation and video frame interpolation tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on five challenging benchmarks for video prediction and
unconditional video generation: BAIR, RoboNet, KTH, KITTI and UCF101. In
addition, MOSO can produce realistic videos by combining objects and scenes
from different videos.

achieved large soliton existence range and deterministic transitions benefit
from the switching dynamics, leading to the cross polarized soliton microcomb

AST models have recently shown promise on DCASE2022 challenge task4 where they
help mitigate a lack of sufficient real annotated data. However, mainly due to
differences between the AT and SED tasks, it is suboptimal to directly utilize
outputs from a pretrained AST model. Hence the proposed AST-SED adopts an
encoder-decoder architecture to enable effective and efficient fine-tuning
without needing to redesign or retrain the AST model. Specifically, the
Frequency-wise Transformer Encoder (FTE) consists of transformers with self
attention along the frequency axis to address multiple overlapped audio events

of nearest-neighbor interpolation (NNI) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units

the problem is treated using Tikhonov's regularization method, where a degree
of damping is added to each singular value decomposition (SVD) component of the
solution, thus effectively filtering out the components corresponding to the
small singular values.

and immersive experiences for users. To date, how to accurately model the user
perceptions on 360$^\circ$ display is still a challenging issue. In this paper,
we exploit the visual characteristics of 360$^\circ$ projection and display and
extend the popular just noticeable difference (JND) model to spherical JND
(SJND). First, we propose a quantitative 2D-JND model by jointly considering
spatial contrast sensitivity, luminance adaptation and texture masking effect.
In particular, our model introduces an entropy-based region classification and
utilizes different parameters for different types of regions for better
modeling performance. Second, we extend our 2D-JND model to SJND by jointly
exploiting latitude projection and field of view during 360$^\circ$ display.
With this operation, SJND reflects both the characteristics of human vision
system and the 360$^\circ$ display. Third, our SJND model is more consistent
with user perceptions during subjective test and also shows more tolerance in
distortions with fewer bit rates during 360$^\circ$ video compression. To
further examine the effectiveness of our SJND model, we embed it in Versatile
Video Coding (VVC) compression. Compared with the state-of-the-arts, our
SJND-VVC framework significantly reduced the bit rate with negligible loss in
visual quality.

this paper, we introduce the concept of fairness into the biclique model for
the first time and study the problem of fairness-aware biclique enumeration.
Specifically, we propose two fairness-aware biclique models, called
\nonesidebc~and \ntwosidebc~respectively. To efficiently enumerate all
{\nonesidebc}s, we first present two non-trivial pruning techniques, called
fair $\alpha$-$\beta$ core pruning and colorful fair $\alpha$-$\beta$ core

branch and bound algorithm, called \onesideFBCEM, to enumerate all single-side
fair bicliques on the reduced bipartite graph. To further improve the

carefully-designed combinatorial enumeration technique. Note that all of our
techniques can also be extended to enumerate all bi-side fair bicliques. We
also extend the two fairness-aware biclique models by constraining the ratio of
the number of vertices of each attribute to the total number of vertices and
present corresponding enumeration algorithms. Extensive experimental results on
five large real-world datasets demonstrate our methods' efficiency,

Phytoplankton analysis, but it is very difficult because of the huge amount and
tiny volume of Phytoplankton. Machine learning is the principle way of
performing phytoplankton image classification automatically. When carrying out
large-scale research on the marine phytoplankton, the volume of data increases
overwhelmingly and more powerful computational resources are required for the
success of machine learning algorithms. Recently, quantum machine learning has
emerged as the potential solution for large-scale data processing by harnessing
the exponentially computational power of quantum computer. Here, for the first
time, we demonstrate the feasibility of quantum deep neural networks for
phytoplankton classification. Hybrid quantum-classical convolutional and
residual neural networks are developed based on the classical architectures.
These models make a proper balance between the limited function of the current
quantum devices and the large size of phytoplankton images, which make it
possible to perform phytoplankton classification on the near-term quantum
computers. Better performance is obtained by the quantum-enhanced models
against the classical counterparts. In particular, quantum models converge much
faster than classical ones. The present quantum models are versatile, and can
be applied for various tasks of image classification in the field of marine

The Rothe scheme's basic idea is to use Rothe functions to extend the solutions

introduce a uniform mesh time-discrete scheme based on a discrete convolution
approximation in the backward sense. By applying some reasonable assumptions to
the given data, we can predict a priori estimates for the time-discrete

proof of the solution's existence over the whole time interval. Finally, the
full discretisation of the problem is introduced by invoking Galerkin spectral
techniques in the spatial direction, and numerical examples are given.

approach to generative modeling which builds on the stale (time-independent)
approximation of the gradient flow of entropy-regularized f-divergences
introduced in DGflow. In DGflow, the intractable time-dependent density ratio
is approximated by a stale estimator given by a GAN discriminator. This is
sufficient in the case of sample refinement, where the source and target
distributions of the flow are close to each other. However, this assumption is
invalid for generation and a naive application of the stale estimator fails due
to the large chasm between the two distributions. FDRL proposes to train a
density ratio estimator such that it learns from progressively improving
samples during the training process. We show that this simple method alleviates
the density chasm problem, allowing FDRL to generate images of dimensions as
high as $128\times128$, as well as outperform existing gradient flow baselines
on quantitative benchmarks. We also show the flexibility of FDRL with two use
cases. First, unconditional FDRL can be easily composed with external
classifiers to perform class-conditional generation. Second, FDRL can be
directly applied to unpaired image-to-image translation with no modifications

the field of quantum information science. In recent years, the quantum resource
theory (QRT) has been established to characterize various quantum resources,
yet their roles in quantum computing tasks still require investigation. The
so-called universal quantum computing model (UQCM), e.g., the circuit model,
has been the main framework to guide the design of quantum algorithms, creation
of real quantum computers etc. In this work, we combine the study of UQCM
together with QRT. We find on one hand, using QRT can provide a
resource-theoretic characterization of a UQCM, the relation among models and
inspire new ones, and on the other hand, using UQCM offers a framework to apply
resources, study relation among resources and classify them.
  We develop the theory of universal resources in the setting of UQCM, and find
a rich spectrum of UQCMs and the corresponding universal resources. Depending
on a hierarchical structure of resource theories, we find models can be
classified into families. In this work, we study three natural families of
UQCMs in details: the amplitude family, the quasi-probability family, and the
Hamiltonian family. They include some well known models, like the
measurement-based model and adiabatic model, and also inspire new models such
as the contextual model we introduce. Each family contains at least a triplet
of models, and such a succinct structure of families of UQCMs offers a unifying
picture to investigate resources and design models. It also provides a rigorous
framework to resolve puzzles, such as the role of entanglement vs.
interference, and unravel resource-theoretic features of quantum algorithms.

a variety of applications, which has been extensively studied over static road
networks. However, in reality, the travel costs of road segments evolve over
time, and hence the road network can be modeled as a time-dependent graph. In
this paper, we study the shortest path query over large-scale time-dependent
road networks. Existing work focuses on a hierarchical partition structure,
which makes the index construction and travel cost query inefficient. To
improve the efficiency of such queries, we propose a novel index by decomposing
a road network into a tree structure and selecting a set of shortcuts on the
tree to speed up the query processing. Specifically, we first formally define a
shortcut selection problem over the tree decomposition of the time-dependent
road network. This problem, which is proven to be NP-hard, aims to select and
build the most effective shortcut set. We first devise a dynamic programming
method with exact results to solve the selection problem. To obtain the optimal
shortcut set quickly, we design an approximation algorithm that guarantees a
0.5-approximation ratio. Based on the novel tree structure, we devise a
shortcut-based algorithm to answer the shortest path query over time-dependent
road networks. Finally, we conduct extensive performance studies using
large-scale real-world road networks. The results demonstrate that our method
can achieve better efficiency and scalability than the state-of-the-art method.

between the number of negative charges on the encapsulated polyelectrolyte
molecules and the number of positive charges on the RNA binding domains of the
coat proteins that make up the virus shell or capsid. By applying
Poisson-Boltzmann theory, we confirm this conclusion and show that simple
Donnan theory is accurate even for the smallest of viruses and virus-like
particles. This, in part, is due to the additional screening caused by the
presence of a large number of immobile charges in the cavity of the shell. The
presence of a net charge on the outer surface of the capsid we find in practice
to not have a large effect on the pH shift. Hence, Donnan theory can indeed be
applied to connect the local pH and the amount of encapsulated material. The
large shifts up to a full pH unit that we predict must have consequences for
applications of virus capsids as nanocontainers in bionanotechnology and
artificial cell organelles.

typically requires the recognization of an opportune and appropriate time for
maneuvers. In this work, we propose a chance-aware lane-change strategy with
high-level model predictive control (MPC) through curriculum reinforcement
learning (CRL). The embodied high-level MPC in our proposed framework is
parameterized with augmented decision variables, where full-state references
and regulatory factors concerning their importance are introduced. In this
sense, improved adaptiveness to dense and dynamic environments with high
complexity is exhibited. Furthermore, to improve the convergence speed and
ensure a high-quality policy, effective curriculum design is integrated into
the reinforcement learning (RL) framework with policy transfer and enhancement.
With comprehensive experiments towards the chance-aware lane-change scenario,
accelerated convergence speed and improved reward performance are demonstrated
through comparisons with representative baseline methods. It is noteworthy
that, given a narrow chance in the dense and dynamic traffic flow, the proposed
approach generates high-quality lane-change maneuvers such that the vehicle
merges into the traffic flow with a high success rate.

However, most prior works adopt a single fixed threshold for all classes to

reported to date occurs along the longitudinal direction with the nonreciprocal
resistance limited to a few percent of the ohmic resistance. Here we report a
transverse nonreciprocal transport phenomenon with divergent nonreciprocity -
colossal nonreciprocal Hall effect. This is revealed in direct current (DC)
transport measurements on microscale crystals of the Weyl semimetal NbP at zero
magnetic field. When a DC ($I_a$) is applied along its a-axis, it generates a
voltage along the c-axis ($V_c$) near room temperature, with $V_c$
quadratically scaling with $I_a$. The transverse resistance, which shows a sign
reversal upon switching the current direction, results from a colossal
intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) rooted in the band topology and quantum
symmetry. Such a NLHE yields an exceptionally large Hall angle ${\Theta_H}$,
e.g. ${\Theta_H}$ = 39{\deg} at $I_a$ =1 mA at 330K, far exceeding the record
value (~ 12{\deg}) of the anomalous Hall angle at room temperature in magnetic
conductors. Furthermore, we find the large Hall field also results in an
unprecedented bulk electrical field effect, which increases the longitudinal
conductivity, thus causing the breakdown of Ohm's law. These results not only
demonstrate the concept of nonreciprocal Hall effect for the first time but
also pave the way for developing NLHE-based quantum sensors for transformative
advancement in communication technology and energy harvesting.

While some sheet music is available with expert-annotated fingering

learning the fingering from demonstrations in online videos. We consider the AI
task of automating the extraction of fingering information from videos. This is
a non-trivial task as fingers are often occluded by other fingers, and it is

combination of deep-learning modules, including a GAN-based approach for
fine-tuning on out-of-domain data. We extract the fingering information with an

capture the legal rules that govern real-world business workflows. (2) Include
simple means for specifying policies for access and authorization. (3) Support
the composition of simple workflows into complex ones, even when the simple

  We present the open-source smart contract language Daml based on Haskell with
strict evaluation. Daml achieves these desiderata by offering novel primitives
for representing, accessing, and modifying data on the ledger, which are
mimicking the primitives of today's legal systems. Robust access and
authorization policies are specified as part of these primitives, and Daml's
built-in authorization rules enable delegation, which is key for workflow
composability. These properties make Daml well-suited for orchestrating
business workflows across multiple, otherwise heterogeneous parties.
  Daml contracts run (1) on centralized ledgers backed by a database, (2) on
distributed deployments with Byzantine fault tolerant consensus, and (3) on top
of conventional blockchains, as a second layer via an atomic commit protocol.

objective function is a black-box and can only be evaluated through a ranking

cases where the function is assessed by human judges. Reinforcement Learning
with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a prominent example of such an application, which
is adopted by the recent works
\cite{ouyang2022training,liu2023languages,chatgpt,bai2022training} to improve
the quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human guidance. We propose
ZO-RankSGD, a first-of-its-kind zeroth-order optimization algorithm, to solve
this optimization problem with a theoretical guarantee. Specifically, our
algorithm employs a new rank-based random estimator for the descent direction
and is proven to converge to a stationary point. ZO-RankSGD can also be
directly applied to the policy search problem in reinforcement learning when
only a ranking oracle of the episode reward is available. This makes ZO-RankSGD
a promising alternative to existing RLHF methods, as it optimizes in an online
fashion and thus can work without any pre-collected data. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of ZO-RankSGD in a novel application: improving
the quality of images generated by a diffusion generative model with human
ranking feedback. Throughout experiments, we found that ZO-RankSGD can
significantly enhance the detail of generated images with only a few rounds of
human feedback. Overall, our work advances the field of zeroth-order

After that we consider the problem of regularization of arising ultraviolet

of systematic exposition and examination of the subject. We seek to rectify
this by surveying the different approaches in the literature and providing
philosophical discussion on requirements for notions of congruences of posets.
We advocate a pluralist approach which recognises that different types of
congruence arise naturally in different mathematical situations. There are some
notions of congruence which are very general, whilst others capture specific
structure which often appears in examples. Indeed, we finish by giving several
examples where quotients of posets appear naturally in mathematics.

allowing high-precision synchronization between peers and round-trip time
calculation (Wi-Fi RTT) for location estimation - typically with a precision of
one to two meters. This has considerable advantages over received signal
strength (RSS)-based trilateration, which is prone to errors due to multipath
reflections. We examine different commercial radios which support Wi-Fi RTT and
benchmark Wi-Fi FTM ranging over different spectrums and bandwidths.
Importantly, we find that while Wi-Fi FTM supports localization accuracy to
within one to two meters in ideal conditions during outdoor line-of-sight
experiments, for indoor environments at short ranges similar accuracy was only
achievable on chipsets supporting Wi-Fi FTM on wider (VHT80) channel bandwidths
rather than narrower (HT20) channel bandwidths. Finally, we explore the
security implications of Wi-Fi FTM and use an on-air sniffer to demonstrate
that Wi-Fi FTM messages are unprotected. We consequently propose a threat model
with possible mitigations and directions for further research.

shared reward. Additionally, we jointly train our model with multiple world

of both source and target data during the adaptation. In this work, we
investigate Source-free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SF-UDA), a specific
case of UDA where a model is adapted to a target domain without access to
source data. We propose a novel approach for the SF-UDA setting based on a loss
reweighting strategy that brings robustness against the noise that inevitably
affects the pseudo-labels. The classification loss is reweighted based on the
reliability of the pseudo-labels that is measured by estimating their
uncertainty. Guided by such reweighting strategy, the pseudo-labels are
progressively refined by aggregating knowledge from neighbouring samples.
Furthermore, a self-supervised contrastive framework is leveraged as a target
space regulariser to enhance such knowledge aggregation. A novel negative pairs
exclusion strategy is proposed to identify and exclude negative pairs made of
samples sharing the same class, even in presence of some noise in the
pseudo-labels. Our method outperforms previous methods on three major
benchmarks by a large margin. We set the new SF-UDA state-of-the-art on VisDA-C
and DomainNet with a performance gain of +1.8% on both benchmarks and on PACS
with +12.3% in the single-source setting and +6.6% in multi-target adaptation.
Additional analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach is robust to the
noise, which results in significantly more accurate pseudo-labels compared to
state-of-the-art approaches.

naked core planets. We obtained HARPS spectroscopic observations, one
ground-based transit, and high-resolution imaging which we combined with the
TESS photometry to confirm and characterise the TESS candidate and its host
star. The host star is an active early K dwarf with a mass of $0.80 \pm
0.04\,$M$_\odot$, a radius of $0.769 \pm 0.026\,$R$_\odot$, and a G magnitude
of 8. We found that the host star is young, $\sim 0.52\,$ Myr, allowing us to
gain insight into planetary evolution. We derived a planetary mass of $6.1 \pm
1.6\,\mathrm{M}_E$,\, a planetary radius of $2.25 \pm 0.12\,\mathrm{R}_E$,\ and
a planetary density of $\rho_p = 3.27_{-0.91}^{+0.97}\,\mathrm{g.cm^{-3}}$.
From internal structure modelling of the planet, we conclude that the planet
has either a water-rich envelope, a gas-rich envelope, or a mixture of both. We
have performed evaporation modelling of the planet. If we assume the planet has
a gas-rich envelope, we find that the planet has lost a significant fraction of
its envelope and its radius has shrunk. Furthermore, we estimate it will lose
all its remaining gaseous envelope in $\sim 0.52\,$ Gyr. Otherwise, the planet
could have already lost all its primordial gas and is now a bare ocean planet.
Further observations of its possible atmosphere and/or mass-loss rate would
allow us to distinguish between these two hypotheses. Such observations would
determine if the planet remains above the radius gap or if it will shrink and
be below the gap.

combination with our result from [13, S5], which shows that the endo-rigid

that four major notions of rigidity from (abelian) group theory are as complex
as possible as co-analytic problems. Further, the second and third theorem

space of all countable groups. We leave open the question of whether the
co-Hopfian mixed abelian groups are complete co-analytic in the space of
countable abelian groups, but we reduce the problem to a concrete question on
profinite groups, showing that if $G$ is a countable co-Hopfian abelian reduced

$\mathrm{Tor}_p(G)$ of $G$ is finite and $G$ embeds in the profinite group $

tuning the strength of the barrier magnetic moment and spin mismatch angle.
Moreover, a possible $0 - \pi$ transition can also be achieved for SOC stronger

plasmas and nonrelativistic and ultra-relativistic degenerate plasmas at low
temperatures is known. We consider a multi-component relativistic degenerate
electron-positron-ion plasma at finite temperatures. Specifically, we focus on
the intermediate region where the particle's Fermi energy $(k_BT_F)$ slightly
differs from the thermal energy $(k_BT)$ and the rest mass energy $(mc^2)$,
i.e., $k_BT_F>k_BT\sim mc^2$ and the normalized chemical energy
($\xi=\mu/k_BT$) is positive and finite. Two different parameter regimes with
$\beta\equiv k_BT/mc^2<1$ and $\beta>1$, relevant for astrophysical plasmas,
are defined, and the existence of small amplitude ion-acoustic solitons in
these regimes are studied, including the critical cases where the known KdV
(Korteweg-de Vries) theory fails. We show that while the solitons with both the
positive (compressive) and negative (rarefactive) potentials coexist in the
case of $\beta<1$, only compressive solitons can exist in the other regime
$(\beta>1)$. Furthermore, while the rarefactive solitons within the parameter
domains of $\beta$ and $\xi$ can evolve with increasing amplitude and hence
increasing energy, the energy of compressive solitons reaches a steady state.

great potential in locomotion and manipulation control tasks. However, the
existing planning methods, such as the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM), do not scale
well to complex high-dimensional environments. One of the key reasons for
underperformance is the lack of exploration, as these planning methods only aim
to maximize the cumulative extrinsic reward over the planning horizon.
Furthermore, planning inside the compact latent space in the absence of
observations makes it challenging to use curiosity-based intrinsic motivation.
We propose Curiosity CEM (CCEM), an improved version of the CEM algorithm for
encouraging exploration via curiosity. Our proposed method maximizes the sum of
state-action Q values over the planning horizon, in which these Q values
estimate the future extrinsic and intrinsic reward, hence encouraging reaching
novel observations. In addition, our model uses contrastive representation
learning to efficiently learn latent representations. Experiments on
image-based continuous control tasks from the DeepMind Control suite show that
CCEM is by a large margin more sample-efficient than previous MBRL algorithms
and compares favorably with the best model-free RL methods.

identifies any sudden discontinuity and recognizes distinct dynamical patterns,
''regimes'' (e.g., weekday/weekend/holiday patterns). In each regime, it also
performs multi-way summarization for all attributes (e.g., item, price, brand,

item/brand groups) and their relationship. Thanks to its concise but effective
summarization, CubeScope can also detect the sudden appearance of anomalies and
identify the types of anomalies that occur in practice. Our proposed method has
the following properties: (a) Effective: it captures dynamical multi-aspect
patterns, i.e., regimes and components, and statistically summarizes all the
events; (b) General: it is practical for successful application to data
compression, pattern discovery, and anomaly detection on various types of

capture this behaviour in a parameterised mass-loss rate, benchmarked by
results from $N$-body simulations, and use it to evolve an initial GC mass
function (GCMF), similar to that of young massive clusters in the Local
Universe, to an age of 12 Gyr. Low-metallicity GCs ([Fe/H]$\lesssim-1.5$) have
the highest mass-loss rates, because of their relatively high BH masses, which
combined with their more radial orbits and stronger tidal field in the past
explains the high turnover mass of the GCMF ($\sim10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$) at
large Galactic radii ($\gtrsim 10\,$kpc). The turnover mass at smaller Galactic
radii is similar as the result of the upper mass truncation of the initial GCMF
and the lower mass-loss rate because of the higher metallicities. The density
profile in the Galaxy of mass lost from massive GCs ($\gtrsim10^{5}\,{\rm

these stars originated from GCs. We conclude that two-body relaxation is the
dominant effect in shaping the GCMF from a universal initial GCMF, because

these features allows the identification of paper stock and gives information
about chronology, localisation and movement of books and people. Most

on radiography or transmitted light images. While these imaging methods provide

However, reflected light images of medieval paper manuscripts are abundant and
possibly cheaper in their acquisition. In this paper, we propose algorithms to
detect and extract the laid and chain lines from reflected light images. We
tackle the main drawback of reflected light images, that is, the low contrast
attenuation of lines and intensity jumps due to noise and degradation, by
employing the spectral total variation decomposition and develop methods for
subsequent line extraction. Our results clearly demonstrate the feasibility of
using reflected light images in paper analysis. This work enables the feature
extraction for paper manuscripts that have otherwise not been analysed due to a

Herein, we extensively review the values of inequality measures, namely the
Gini ($g$) index and the Kolkata ($k$) index, two standard measures of
inequality used in the analysis of various social sectors through data
analysis. The Kolkata index, denoted as $k$, indicates the proportion of the
`wealth' owned by $(1-k)$ fraction of the `people'. Our findings suggest that
both the Gini index and the Kolkata index tend to converge to similar values
(around $g=k \approx 0.87$, starting from the point of perfect equality, where
$g=0$ and $k=0.5$) as competition increases in different social institutions,
such as markets, movies, elections, universities, prize winning, battle fields,
sports (Olympics), etc., under conditions of unrestricted competition (no
social welfare or support mechanism). In this review, we present the concept of
a generalized form of Pareto's 80/20 law ($k=0.80$), where the coincidence of
inequality indices is observed. The observation of this coincidence is
consistent with the precursor values of the $g$ and $k$ indices for the
self-organized critical (SOC) state in self-tuned physical systems such as sand
piles. These results provide quantitative support for the view that interacting
socioeconomic systems can be understood within the framework of SOC, which has
been hypothesized for many years. These findings suggest that the SOC model can
be extended to capture the dynamics of complex socioeconomic systems and help
us better understand their behavior.

Lformer, a semi-autoregressive text-to-image generation model. Lformer firstly
encodes an image into $h{\times}h$ discrete tokens, then divides these tokens
into $h$ mirrored L-shape blocks from the top left to the bottom right and
decodes the tokens in a block parallelly in each step. Lformer predicts the
area adjacent to the previous context like autoregressive models thus it is
more stable while accelerating. By leveraging the 2D structure of image tokens,
Lformer achieves faster speed than the existing transformer-based methods while
keeping good generation quality. Moreover, the pretrained Lformer can edit
images without the requirement for finetuning. We can roll back to the early
steps for regeneration or edit the image with a bounding box and a text prompt.

Satellite System) signals. In addition to accelerometers, gyroscopes, and
magnetometers, the proposed navigation filter relies on the accurate
incremental displacement outputs generated by a VO (Visual Odometry) system,
denoted here as a Virtual Vision Sensor or VVS, which relies on images of the
Earth surface taken by an onboard camera and is itself assisted by the filter
inertial estimations. Although not a full replacement for a GNSS receiver since
its position observations are relative instead of absolute, the proposed system
enables major reductions in the GNSS-Denied attitude and position estimation
errors. In order to minimize the accumulation of errors in the absence of
absolute observations, the filter is implemented in the manifold of rigid body
rotations or SO (3). Stochastic high fidelity simulations of two representative
scenarios involving the loss of GNSS signals are employed to evaluate the
results. The authors release the C++ implementation of both the visual inertial
navigation filter and the high fidelity simulation as open-source software.

different Reynolds numbers 40<Re<150 and resolved on different grids. The GNN

optimization (BAO) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem that is

quality of IMRT treatment planning, we propose a deep reinforcement learning
(DRL)-based approach for IMRT BAO. We consider the task as a sequential
decision-making problem and formulate it as a Markov Decision Process. To
facilitate the training process, a 3D-Unet is designed to predict the dose

simulate the IMRT environment. By leveraging the simulation model, double
deep-Q network (DDQN) and proximal policy optimization (PPO) are used to train

Results: The treatment plans with beam angles selected by DRL outperform those
with clinically used evenly distributed beam angles. For DDQN, the overall

study on the dynamics of the jets produced by the collapse of gas cavities of
generic shape when the implosion is forced by a far field boundary condition
expressing that the flow rate per unit length, $q_\infty$, remains constant in
time. Making use of theory and of numerical simulations, we first analyze the
case of a conical bubble with a half-opening angle $\beta$ when the value of
$q_\infty$ is fixed to a constant, finding that this type of jets converge
towards a purely inertial $\beta$-dependent self-similar solution of the
equations in which the jet width and velocity are respectively given, in the
limit $\beta\ll 1$, by $r_{jet}\approx 2.25\tan\beta\sqrt{q_\infty\tau}$ and
$v_{jet}\approx 3 q_\infty/(2\tan\beta\sqrt{q_\infty\tau})$ respectively, with
$\tau$ indicating the dimensionless time after the jet is ejected. For the case
of parabolic cavities with a dimensionless radius of curvature at the plane of
symmetry $r_c$ our theory predicts that $r_{jet}\propto \left(2
r_c\right)^{-1/2}\left(q_\infty \tau\right)^{3/4}$ and $v_{jet}\propto q_\infty
\left(2r_c\right)^{1/2} \left(q_\infty\tau\right)^{-3/4}$, a result which is
also in good agreement with numerical simulations. The present results might

to general relativity (GR). One class of STG theories, the
Damour-Esposito-Farese (DEF) gravity, has a massless scalar field with two
arbitrary coupling parameters. We are interested in this theory because,
despite its simplicity, it predicts a wealth of different phenomena, such as
dipolar gravitational wave emission and spontaneous scalarization of neutron
stars (NSs). These phenomena of DEF gravity can be tested by timing binary
radio pulsars. Aims. We aim to develop a new binary pulsar timing model DDSTG
to enable more precise tests of STG theories based on a minimal set of binary
parameters. The expressions for post-Keplerian (PK) parameters in DEF gravity
are self-consistently incorporated into the model. The new technique takes into
account all possible correlations between PK parameters naturally. Methods.
Grids of physical parameters of NSs are calculated in the framework of DEF
gravity for a set of 11 equations of state. The automatic Differentiation
(AutoDiff) technique is employed, which aids in the calculation of
gravitational form factors of NSs with higher precision than in previous works.
The pulsar timing program TEMPO is selected as a framework for the realization
of the DDSTG model. The implemented model is applicable to any type of pulsar
companions. Results. We apply the DDSTG model to the most recently published
observational data for PSR J2222-0137. The obtained limits on DEF gravity

in the framework of {\it MACER}, we investigate the fate of the inflow and its
impacts on the evolution of a massive elliptical galaxy. The inflow properties
are adopted from the cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG. We find that, the
inflow gas hardly enters but is blocked beyond $\sim 20$ kpc from the central
galaxy and becomes part of the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The gas pressure
gradient, mainly contributed by the thermalized stellar wind and subdominantly
by the energy input from the AGN, balances gravity and prevents the inflow from
entering the galaxy. The SFR and BHAR are almost not affected by the normal
inflow. However, if the rate of cosmological inflow were increased by a factor
of 3, a small fraction of the inflow would enter the galaxy and contribute
about 10\% of the gas in the galaxy. In this case, the gas density in the
galaxy would increase by a factor of $\ga$ 20. This increase is not because of
the additional gas supply by the inflow but the increase of gas density in the
CGM caused by the inflow. Consequently, the SFR and BHAR would increase by a
factor of $\sim$ 5 and $\sim 1000$ respectively. Finally, AGN feedback can
perturb the motion of the inflow and heat the CGM through its intermittent
outbursts.

the local and the non-local conductance spectroscopy have been subject to
intense scrutiny. In this work, by taking current experimental setups into
account, we detail mathematical ideas related to the entanglement entropy and
the fermion parity fluctuations to faithfully distinguish between true Majorana
zero modes and trivial quasi-Majorana zero modes. We demonstrate that the
disconnected entanglement entropy, derived from the von Neumann entanglement
entropy, provides a distinct and robust signature of the topological phase
transition which is immune to system parameters, size and disorders. In order
to understand the entanglement entropy of the Rashba nanowire system, we
establish its connection to a model of interacting spinfull Kitaev chains.
Moreover, we relate the entanglement entropy to the fermionic parity
fluctuation, and show that it behaves concordantly with entanglement entropy,
hence making it a suitable metric for the detection of Majorana zero modes. In
connection with the topological gap protocol that is based on the conductance
spectra, the aforesaid metrics can reliably point toward the topological
transitions even in realistic setups.

literature regarding the ability of such calculations to describe electronic
excitations of point defects. A direct orbital optimization method is used here
to perform time-independent, variational density functional calculations of a
prototypical defect, the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond.
The calculations include up to 511 atoms subject to periodic boundary
conditions and the excited state calculations require similar computational
effort as ground state calculations. Contrary to some previous reports, the use
of local and semilocal density functionals gives the correct ordering of the
low-lying triplet and singlet states, namely ${}^{3}A_2 < {}^{1}E < {}^{1}A_1 <
{}^{3}E$. Furthermore, the more advanced meta generalized gradient
approximation functionals give results that are in remarkably good agreement
with high-level, many-body calculations as well as available experimental
estimates, even for the excited singlet state which is often referred to as
having multireference character. The lowering of the energy in the triplet
excited state as the atom coordinates are optimized in accordance with
analytical forces is also close to the experimental estimate and the resulting
zero-phonon line triplet excitation energy is underestimated by only 0.15 eV.
The approach used here is found to be a promising tool for studying electronic
excitations of point defects in, for example, systems relevant for quantum

However, this is a complex line comprising two isotope fine-structure doublets.
We empirically measure the wavelength of this Li feature in a sample of young
stars from the PENELLOPE/VLT programme (using X-Shooter, UVES and ESPRESSO
data) as well as HARPS data. For 51 targets, we fit 314 individual spectra
using the STAR-MELT package, resulting in 241 accurately fitted Li features,
given the automated goodness-of-fit threshold. We find the mean air wavelength
to be 6707.856 {\AA}, with a standard error of 0.002 {\AA} (0.09 km/s) and a
weighted standard deviation of 0.026 {\AA} (1.16 km/s). The observed spread in
measured positions spans 0.145 {\AA}, or 6.5 km/s, which is up to a factor of
six higher than typically reported velocity errors for high-resolution studies.
We also find a correlation between the effective temperature of the star and
the wavelength of the central absorption. We discuss how exclusively using this
Li feature as a reference for photocentric velocity in young stars could
potentially be introducing a systematic positive offset in wavelength to
measurements of further spectral lines. If outflow tracing forbidden lines,
such as [O i] 6300 {\AA}, are actually more blueshifted than previously
thought, this then favours a disk wind as the origin for such emission in young

with external confining potentials, the energy scale factor of neighboring
Efimov states can be tremendously reduced. The Efimov conditions can be reached
for systems made of three different particles. For the case of two identical
light particles and a heavy particle the energy factor can be reduced by many
orders of magnitude, and the Efimov states are in this way more easily
reachable experimentally. The equivalence between external potentials and the
formulation in terms of non-integer dimensions, $d$, is exploited. The
technically simpler $d$-method is used to derive analytic expressions for
two-component relative wave functions describing two short-range square-well
interacting particles. The two components express one open and one closed
channel. The scattering length is obtained after phase shift expansion,
providing an analytic form for the Efimov condition. We illustrate the results
by means of systems made of $^7$Li, $^{39}$K, and $^{87}$Rb, with realistic
parameters. The related pairs of dimension and magnetic field are shown and
discussed. The results are universal as they only rely on large-distance

semantic priors versus input-label mappings. We investigate two setups-ICL with
flipped labels and ICL with semantically-unrelated labels-across various model
families (GPT-3, InstructGPT, Codex, PaLM, and Flan-PaLM). First, experiments
on ICL with flipped labels show that overriding semantic priors is an emergent
ability of model scale. While small language models ignore flipped labels
presented in-context and thus rely primarily on semantic priors from
pretraining, large models can override semantic priors when presented with
in-context exemplars that contradict priors, despite the stronger semantic
priors that larger models may hold. We next study semantically-unrelated label
ICL (SUL-ICL), in which labels are semantically unrelated to their inputs
(e.g., foo/bar instead of negative/positive), thereby forcing language models
to learn the input-label mappings shown in in-context exemplars in order to
perform the task. The ability to do SUL-ICL also emerges primarily with scale,
and large-enough language models can even perform linear classification in a
SUL-ICL setting. Finally, we evaluate instruction-tuned models and find that
instruction tuning strengthens both the use of semantic priors and the capacity
to learn input-label mappings, but more of the former.

forces, as those generated by frictional contacts, in mechanical systems that

the sharp variations and multiple motion regimes introduced by these
nonlinearities in the dynamic response, the partially-known physics-based model
and noisy measurements of the system's response to a known input force are
combined within a switching Gaussian process latent force model (GPLFM). In
this grey-box framework, multiple Gaussian processes are used to model the
unknown nonlinear force across different motion regimes and a resetting model
enables the generation of discontinuities. The states of the system, nonlinear
force and regime transitions are inferred by using filtering and smoothing
techniques for switching linear dynamical systems. The proposed switching GPLFM
is applied to a simulated dry friction oscillator and an experimental setup
consisting in a single-storey frame with a brass-to-steel contact. Excellent
results are obtained in terms of the identified nonlinear and discontinuous
friction force for varying: (i) normal load amplitudes in the contact; (ii)
measurement noise levels and (iii) number of samples in the datasets. Moreover,
the identified states, friction force and sequence of motion regimes are used
for evaluating: (1) uncertain system parameters; (2) the friction
force-velocity relationship and (3) the static friction force. The correct
identification of the discontinuous nonlinear force and the quantification of
any remaining uncertainty in its prediction enable the implementation an

field strength of 77 G and a dipolar component strength of 119 G - confirming
it as one of the weakest well-characterised Ap-star fields known. Despite its

semisimple parts of the conjugacy classes of $\rho_{y, \ell}(\mathrm{Frob}_v)$

metallic parts allows structures to be directly manufactured from 3D models.
The Electron Beam Melting (EBM) technology is an example of AM technologies
that enables the manufacturing of new designs. The process is particularly well
suited for the fabrication of lattice structures. Octet-truss lattice structure
has been a subject for research in recent years. Besides being lightweighted,
the structure could provide solid mechanical properties. However, researchers
always encounter the same issue regarding this particular structure. During
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation, stress concentration tends to appear
at the struts intersection. This is due to the sharp edges, thus provoking the
presence of singularities. In this respect, the proposed solution is to
integrate fillets at the struts intersection. However, adding fillet entails a
mass increase of octet-truss structures. To avoid this mass increase related to
these fillets, it is necessary to reduce the size of octet-truss struts. This
research work studies the influence of fillets onto the mechanical properties
of structures with identical mass. To do so, a set of 15 octet-truss structures
are designed with various fillet sizes and strut sizes and compared. Whereas
some of them have thick struts and small fillets, others have smaller struts
and bigger fillets. The main technical issue in this study remains the design
of fillets for octet-truss structures. These latter can indeed be created for
up to 12 struts that converge to the same point. Once designed, these
octet-truss structures are fabricated by EBM technology and undergo static
compression testing. Mechanical properties of each structure are finally
determined. Results show that for the same relative density, octet-truss with
fillets degrades the mechanical characteristics of the whole structures.

system thermalizes, that is, how it relaxes to a thermal equilibrium state. For
such studies, the fundamental issue is to determine whether a given system
thermalizes or not. However, most studies tested only a small number of
observables, and it was unclear whether other observables thermalize. Here, we
study whether `linear thermalization' occurs for all additive observables: We
consider a quantum many-body system prepared in an equilibrium state and its
unitary time evolution induced by a small change $\Delta f$ of a physical
parameter $f$ of the Hamiltonian, and examine whether all additive observables
relax to the equilibrium values in a manner fully consistent with
thermodynamics up to the linear order in $\Delta f$. We find that there exists
a single key observable whose linear thermalization guarantees, under
physically reasonable conditions, linear thermalization of all additive
observables. Such a linear thermalization occurs in the timescale of
$\mathcal{O}(|\Delta f|^0)$, and lasts at least for a period of
$o(1/\sqrt{|\Delta f|})$. We identify the key observable as the additive
observable conjugate to $f$. We also consider linear thermalization against the
change of other parameters, and find that linear thermalization of the key
observable against $\Delta f$ guarantees its linear thermalization against
small changes of any other parameters. Furthermore, we discuss the generalized
susceptibilities for cross responses and their consistency between quantum
mechanics and thermodynamics. We demonstrate our main result by performing
numerical calculations for spin models. The present paper offers an efficient
way of judging linear thermalization because it guarantees that examination of
the single key observable is sufficient.

localized on the image using a CNN and then identified using geometric hashing.
The spin is finally regressed from the estimated orientations. Using our

MoS$_{2}$/permalloy/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ device, and find no significant one for all
other MoS$_{2}$/permalloy/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ devices. This indicates a competition
between the self-torque and the torque arising from the TMD layer, which would
reduce the observed torque in these bilayers. In addition, we find a field-like
spin-torque conductivity of comparable magnitude to control
MoS$_{2}$/permalloy/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ devices, indicating only a minor role of
the MoS$_{2}$ layer. Finally, we find a linear dependence of the SOT
conductivity on the Hall bar leg/channel width ratio of our devices, indicating
that the Hall bar dimensions are of significant importance for the reported SOT
strength. Our results accentuate the importance of delicate details, like
device asymmetry, Hall bar dimensions, and self-torque generation, for the
correct disentanglement of the microscopic origins underlying the SOTs,
essential for future energy-efficient spintronic applications.

an indefinite causal order (ICO). In QKD, one considers a setup in which two
parties, Alice and Bob, share a key with one another in such a way that they
can detect whether an eavesdropper, Eve, has learnt anything about the key. To
our knowledge, in all QKD protocols proposed until now, Eve is detected by
publicly comparing a subset of Alice and Bob's key and checking for errors.
With the use of ICO, we show that it is possible to detect Eve without publicly
comparing any information about the key. Indeed, we prove that both correlated

  datasets",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Supervised learning problems may become ill-posed when there is a lack of
information, resulting in unstable and non-unique solutions. However, instead
of solely relying on regularization, initializing an informative ill-posed
operator is akin to posing better questions to achieve more accurate answers.
The Fredholm integral equation of the first kind (FIFK) is a reliable ill-posed
operator that can integrate distributions and prior knowledge as input
information. By incorporating input distributions and prior knowledge, the FIFK
operator can address the limitations of using high-dimensional input
distributions by semi-supervised assumptions, leading to more precise
approximations of the integral operator. Additionally, the FIFK's incorporation
of probabilistic principles can further enhance the accuracy and effectiveness
of solutions. In cases of noisy operator equations and limited data, the FIFK's
flexibility in defining problems using prior information or cross-validation
with various kernel designs is especially advantageous. This capability allows
for detailed problem definitions and facilitates achieving high levels of
accuracy and stability in solutions. In our study, we examined the FIFK through
two different approaches. Firstly, we implemented a semi-supervised assumption
by using the same Fredholm operator kernel and data function kernel and
incorporating unlabeled information. Secondly, we used the MSDF method, which
involves selecting different kernels on both sides of the equation to define
when the mapping kernel is different from the data function kernel. To assess
the effectiveness of the FIFK and the proposed methods in solving ill-posed
problems, we conducted experiments on a real-world dataset. Our goal was to
compare the performance of these methods against the widely used least-squares
method and other comparable methods.

leverage tools from stochastic geometry to model the spatial positions of the
source-destination pairs and capture the entanglement amongst the nodes'
spatial-temporal attributes through the interference they caused to each other.
We derive analytical expressions for the average and variance of AoI over a
typical transmission link in Poisson bipolar and cellular networks,
respectively. Our analysis shows that in densely deployed networks, the
FSA-based status updating protocol can significantly decrease the average AoI
and in addition, stabilizes the age performance by substantially reducing the
variance of AoI. Furthermore, under the same updating frequency, converting a
slotted ALOHA protocol into an FSA-based one always leads to a reduction in the
average AoI. Moreover, implementing FSA in conjunction with power control can
further benefit the AoI performance, although the particular values of
framesize and power control factor must be adequately tuned to achieve the
optimal gain.

training a common model among different participants with the help of a central
server that coordinates the training. Although only the model parameters or
other model updates are exchanged during the federated training instead of the
participant's data, many attacks have shown that it is still possible to infer
sensitive information such as membership, property, or outright reconstruction
of participant data. Although differential privacy is considered an effective
solution to protect against privacy attacks, it is also criticized for its
negative effect on utility. Another possible defense is to use secure
aggregation which allows the server to only access the aggregated update
instead of each individual one, and it is often more appealing because it does
not degrade model quality. However, combining only the aggregated updates,
which are generated by a different composition of clients in every round, may
still allow the inference of some client-specific information.
  In this paper, we show that simple linear models can effectively capture
client-specific properties only from the aggregated model updates due to the
linearity of aggregation. We formulate an optimization problem across different
rounds in order to infer a tested property of every client from the output of
the linear models, for example, whether they have a specific sample in their
training data (membership inference) or whether they misbehave and attempt to
degrade the performance of the common model by poisoning attacks. Our
reconstruction technique is completely passive and undetectable. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our approach on several scenarios which shows that secure
aggregation provides very limited privacy guarantees in practice. The source

4D sparse convolutions to extract motion features from the 4D voxels and inject
them into the current scan. Then, we extract spatio-temporal features from the
current scan for instance detection and feature fusion. Finally, we design an
upsample fusion module to output point-wise labels by fusing the
spatio-temporal features and predicted instance information. We evaluated our

liquid scintillator detector, which is under construction in China, will have a
unique potential to perform a real-time measurement of solar neutrinos well
below the few MeV threshold typical for Water Cherenkov detectors. JUNO's large
target mass and excellent energy resolution are prerequisites for reaching
unprecedented levels of precision. In this paper, we provide estimation of the
JUNO sensitivity to 7Be, pep, and CNO solar neutrinos that can be obtained via
a spectral analysis above the 0.45 MeV threshold. This study is performed
assuming different scenarios of the liquid scintillator radiopurity, ranging
from the most opti mistic one corresponding to the radiopurity levels obtained
by the Borexino experiment, up to the minimum requirements needed to perform
the neutrino mass ordering determination with reactor antineutrinos - the main
goal of JUNO. Our study shows that in most scenarios, JUNO will be able to
improve the current best measurements on 7Be, pep, and CNO solar neutrino
fluxes. We also perform a study on the JUNO capability to detect periodical
time variations in the solar neutrino flux, such as the day-night modulation
induced by neutrino flavor regeneration in Earth, and the modulations induced
by temperature changes driven by helioseismic waves.

locally enhanced hydrogen concentrations, likely in the form of water ice,
within most permanently shadowed regions (PSR), poleward of 77 deg S latitude.
Results are consistent with the original findings of Watson et al, 1961, which
found that the PSRs cryogenic surfaces create exclusive conditions for the
sequestration of water ice, due to their extremely low sublimation rates.
Widespread PSR hydrogenation is demonstrated in several studies by showing that
the contrasting PSR area distribution is being instrumentally blurred. The PSRs
expected hydrogen observations are correlated by their area fraction of the
fixed 30 km diameter footprint area of the Collimated Sensor for Epithermal
Neutrons (CSETN), which is part of the Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector
(LEND) onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). The correlation
indicates that the PSRs are similarly hydrogenated, with an expected
concentration = 0.27 wt%, relative to that of the anhydrous reference terrain
(lower bounds). Hydrogen concentrations are demonstrated to be correlated to
maximum temperature distributions within the basins of Haworth, Shoemaker and
Faustini PSRs. Cabeus-1 PSR shows an anomalously enhanced hydrogen
concentration indicating a second process contributes to its hydrogen budget.
Results are consistent with ongoing processes that introduce volatiles to the
surface including outgassing, solar wind production with regolith silicates,
and mixing from small scale meteor impacts and diurnal temperature variation.
We validate the bandpass filter used to subtract CSETNs detection of
uncollimated neutrons with profiles of several PSRs neutron suppression before
and after processing.

a document, and an entity-level graph is designed to explore relations of
long-distance cross-sentence entity pairs. Experimental results show that GRACR
achieves excellent performance on two public datasets of document-level RE. It
is especially effective in extracting potential relations of cross-sentence

the positive weight modular forms after the first few coefficients and ensures
the positivity of the helicity trace index $-B_6$. Using numerics and limits of

quark-gluon plasma, as created in the intermediate stages of ultrarelativistic
heavy-ion collisions. We argue that the partons of the jet should acquire a
non-zero average polarisation proportional to the medium anisotropy. We first
observe that the medium anisotropy introduces a difference between the rates
for transverse momentum broadening along the two directions perpendicular to
the jet axis. In turn, this difference leads to a polarisation-dependent bias
in the BDMPS-Z rates for medium-induced gluon branching. Accordingly, the
daughter gluons in a branching process can carry net polarisation even if their
parent gluon was unpolarised. Using these splitting rates, we construct kinetic
equations which describe the production and transmission of polarisation via
multiple branching in an anisotropic medium. The solutions to these equations
show that polarisation is efficiently produced via quasi-democratic branchings,
but then it is rapidly washed out by the subsequent branchings, due to the
inability of soft gluons to keep trace of the polarisation of their parents.
Based on that, we conclude that a net polarisation for the jet should survive
in the final state if and only if the medium anisotropy is sizeable as the jet
escapes the medium.

Leukocytes (WBCs) in the bone marrow and blood. Pathologists can diagnose
leukemia by looking at a person's blood sample under a microscope. They
identify and categorize leukemia by counting various blood cells and
morphological features. This technique is time-consuming for the prediction of
leukemia. The pathologist's professional skills and experiences may be
affecting this procedure, too. In computer vision, traditional machine learning
and deep learning techniques are practical roadmaps that increase the accuracy
and speed in diagnosing and classifying medical images such as microscopic
blood cells. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the detection and
classification of acute leukemia and WBCs in the microscopic blood cells.
First, we have divided the previous works into six categories based on the
output of the models. Then, we describe various steps of detection and
classification of acute leukemia and WBCs, including Data Augmentation,
Preprocessing, Segmentation, Feature Extraction, Feature Selection (Reduction),
Classification, and focus on classification step in the methods. Finally, we
divide automated detection and classification of acute leukemia and WBCs into
three categories, including traditional, Deep Neural Network (DNN), and mixture

classification step and analyze them. The results of this study show that in
the diagnosis and classification of acute leukemia and WBCs, the Support Vector

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier in deep learning models have
widely employed. The performance metrics of the models that use these

the arcuate nucleus (ARC) has been thoroughly studied for its autocrine effect
on KP release through $\kappa$ opioid receptors. Other studies have suggested a
role for $\beta$-endorphin (BEND), a peptide cleaved from the
proopiomelanocortin (POMC) precursor, on food intake and central control of
reproduction. Similarly to KP, BEND content in the ARC of sheep is modulated by
day length and BEND modulates food intake in a dose-dependent manner. As KP
levels in the ARC vary with photoperiodic and metabolic status, a
photoperiod-driven influence of BEND neurons on neighboring KP neurons is
plausible. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate a possible
modulatory action of BEND on KP neurons located in the ovine ARC. Using
confocal microscopy, numerous KP appositions on BEND neurons were found but
there was no photoperiodic variation in the number of these interactions in
ovariectomized, estradiol-replaced ewes. In contrast, BEND terminals on KP
neurons were twice as numerous under short days (SD), in ewes having an
activated gonadotropic axis, as compared to anestrus ewes under long days (LD).
Injection of 5$\mu$g BEND into the third ventricle of SD ewes induced a
significant and specific increase of activated KP neurons (16% versus 9% in
controls) while the percentage of overall activated (c-Fos positive) neurons,
was similar between both groups. These data suggest a photoperiod-dependent
influence of BEND on KP neurons of the ARC, which may influence GnRH pulsatile
secretion and inform KP neurons on the metabolic status.

performance in computer vision. Their computational complexity is proportional
to quadratic numbers of pixels in input feature maps, resulting in slow
processing, especially when dealing with high-resolution images. New types of
token-mixer are proposed as an alternative to MHSA to circumvent this problem:
an FFT-based token-mixer, similar to MHSA in global operation but with lower
computational complexity. However, despite its attractive properties, the
FFT-based token-mixer has not been carefully examined in terms of its
compatibility with the rapidly evolving MetaFormer architecture. Here, we
propose a novel token-mixer called dynamic filter and DFFormer and CDFFormer,
image recognition models using dynamic filters to close the gaps above.
CDFFormer achieved a Top-1 accuracy of 85.0%, close to the hybrid architecture
with convolution and MHSA. Other wide-ranging experiments and analysis,
including object detection and semantic segmentation, demonstrate that they are
competitive with state-of-the-art architectures; Their throughput and memory
efficiency when dealing with high-resolution image recognition is convolution
and MHSA, not much different from ConvFormer, and far superior to CAFormer. Our
results indicate that the dynamic filter is one of the token-mixer options that

serious in power systems with the high penetration of volatile inverter-based

However, existing ED studies rarely proactively optimize the control parameters
of inverter-based resources related to fast regulation (e.g., virtual inertia
and droop coefficients) in cooperation with other dispatchable resources to
improve the system frequency security and dispatch reliability. This paper
first proposes a joint chance-constrained economic dispatch model that jointly
optimizes the frequency-related inverter control, the system up/down reserves,
and base-point power for the minimal total operational cost. In the proposed
model, multiple dispatchable resources including thermal units, dispatchable
IBRs and energy storage are considered, and the (virtual) inertias, the
regulation reserve allocations and the base-point power are coordinated. To
ensure the system reliability, the joint chance-constraint formulation is also
adopted. Additionally, since the traditional sample average approximation (SAA)
method cost much computational burden, a novel mix-SAA (MSAA) method is
proposed to transform the original intractable model into a linear model that
can be efficiently solved via commercial solvers. The case studies validated
the satisfactory efficacy of the proposed ED model and the efficiency of the

small contrasting density, induced by Faraday instability, is investigated
using direct numerical simulations (DNS). We quantify the irreversible mixing
which depicts the conversion of the available potential energy (APE) to the
background potential energy (BPE) through irreversible mixing rate
$\mathcal{M}$. We demonstrate that at lower forcing amplitudes, the turbulent
kinetic energy ($t.k.e.$) increases with an increase in the Coriolis frequency
$f$ till $\left(f/\omega\right)^2<0.25$, where $\omega$ is the forcing
frequency, during the sub-harmonic instability phase. This enhancement of
$t.k.e.$ is attributed to the excitement of more unstable modes. The
irreversible mixing sustains for an extended period with increasing
$\left(f/\omega\right)^2$ till $0.25$ owing to the prolonged sub-harmonic
instability phase and eventually ceases with instability saturation. When
$\left(f/\omega\right)^2 > 0.25$, the Coriolis force significantly delays the
onset of the sub-harmonic instabilities. The strong rotational effects result
in lower turbulence because the bulk of the APE expends to BPE, decreasing APE
that converts back to $t.k.e.$ reservoir for $\left(f/\omega\right)^2 > 0.25$.
Since the instability never saturates for $\left(f/\omega\right)^2 > 0.25$,
conversion of APE to BPE via $\mathcal{M}$ continues, and we find prolonged
irreversible mixing. At higher forcing amplitudes, the instability delaying
effect of rotation is negligible, and the turbulence is less intense and
short-lived. Therefore, the irreversible mixing phenomenon also ends quickly
for $\left(f/\omega\right)^2<0.25$. However, when
$\left(f/\omega\right)^2>0.25$, a continuous irreversible mixing is observed.

both upper-level and lower-level problems are nonconvex, and the lower-level

efficiency. However, the accuracy of the dynamics model and the resulting
compounding error over modelled trajectories are commonly regarded as key
limitations. A natural question to ask is: How much more sample efficiency can
be gained by improving the learned dynamics models? Our paper empirically
answers this question for the class of model-based value expansion methods in
continuous control problems. Value expansion methods should benefit from
increased model accuracy by enabling longer rollout horizons and better value
function approximations. Our empirical study, which leverages oracle dynamics
models to avoid compounding model errors, shows that (1) longer horizons
increase sample efficiency, but the gain in improvement decreases with each
additional expansion step, and (2) the increased model accuracy only marginally
increases the sample efficiency compared to learned models with identical
horizons. Therefore, longer horizons and increased model accuracy yield
diminishing returns in terms of sample efficiency. These improvements in sample
efficiency are particularly disappointing when compared to model-free value
expansion methods. Even though they introduce no computational overhead, we
find their performance to be on-par with model-based value expansion methods.
Therefore, we conclude that the limitation of model-based value expansion
methods is not the model accuracy of the learned models. While higher model
accuracy is beneficial, our experiments show that even a perfect model will not
provide an un-rivalled sample efficiency but that the bottleneck lies
elsewhere.

origin for explaining neutrino mass, lepton asymmetry and give a dark matter
candidate. We start out with the extension of the Standard Model with fermions,
which are odd under a discrete symmetry, with the SM-like fermions we also have
a doublet scalar field like Higgs but odd under discrete symmetry. This model
has potential similar to the inert doublet model, which implies we can have a
Dark Matter candidate similar to IDM, the Dark matter aspect and calculation of
DM parameters are not discussed extensively. In this model, we can calculate
the mass of neutrinos from loop corrections that were massless at the tree
level, and define a physical mass matrix which requires the inclusion of the
Weinberg operator. Then we look at lepton number violation through decays of
heavy Majorana neutrinos, these generate a lepton asymmetry, then with the help
of sphalerons they convert the excess of lepton number to baryon number, this
conversion is quantified by conversion factor. To calculate the number
densities we use the Boltzmann equation, and CP asymmetry parameter which gives
us the net lepton number produced, at last, the present baryon-to-photon ratio
is estimated.

optimisation of business processes. So far, decision mining has been merely
applied in an ex-post way resulting in a snapshot of decision rules for the

continuous monitoring of decision rule evolution and decision drift. Hence this
paper presents an end-to-end approach for the discovery as well as monitoring
of decision points and the corresponding decision rules during runtime,
bridging the gap between online control flow discovery and decision mining. The
approach provides automatic decision support for process-aware information
systems with efficient decision drift discovery and monitoring. For monitoring,
not only the performance, in terms of accuracy, of decision rules is taken into
account, but also the occurrence of data elements and changes in branching
frequency. The paper provides two algorithms, which are evaluated on four
synthetic and one real-life data set, showing feasibility and applicability of
the approach. Overall, the approach fosters the understanding of decisions in

number of cops required to catch a robber over all multi-layer graphs where
each edge of G is in at least one layer and all layers are connected? For

to be a result of the competition of Kelvin impulsive forces and thermal
Marangoni forces applied on residual bubbles after collapse. The former
originates from asymmetric bubble collapse, resulting in the directed
locomotion of residual bubbles away from the laser spot. The latter arises in a
laser irradiation induced heat affected zone (HAZ). When the Kelvin impulses
dominates, residual bubbles move out of the HAZ and the periodic bubble
nucleation occurs, with terminated subsequent steadily growing phases. We
experimentally and numerically study the dependence of the nucleation frequency
f on laser power and laser spot size. Moreover, we show that strong fluid flows
over 10 mm/s in a millimeter range is steadily achievable by the periodically
nucleated bubbles. Overall, our observation highlights the opportunities of
remotely realizing strong localized flows, paving a way to achieve efficient

galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial to constraining their properties and to
studying their evolution. While direct methods yield reliable measurements of
$M_\mathrm{BH}$ in unobscured type 1 AGN, where the dynamics of stellar or gas
components can be directly observed, only indirect methods can be applied to
the vast majority of heavily absorbed type 2 AGN, which represent most of the
AGN population. Since it is difficult to evaluate the accuracy and precision of
these indirect methods, we utilize the nearby X-ray bright Seyfert galaxy NGC
4151, whose $M_\mathrm{BH}$ has been tightly constrained with several
independent direct methods, as a laboratory to assess the reliability of three
indirect methods that have been applied to obscured AGN. All three, the X-ray
scaling method, the fundamental plane of black hole activity, and the
M-$\sigma$ correlation, yield $M_\mathrm{BH}$ values consistent with those
inferred from direct methods and can therefore be considered accurate. However,
only the X-ray scaling method and the M-$\sigma$ correlation are precise
because the substantial scatter in the fundamental plane of BH activity allows
only for crude estimates. Of the four M-$\sigma$ correlations we used, only the
one from Kormendy and Ho yields a value consistent with the dynamical
estimates. This study suggests that the best approach to estimating the black
hole mass in systems where direct dynamical methods cannot be applied is to
utilize a combination of indirect methods, taking into account their different
ranges of applicability.

potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a
modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the
hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks.
We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than
Transformers and performs better than LSTM models on a simple memory-based
task. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences,
we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the
agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with
a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and
actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to
out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this

behaviour of a distributed system is coded as a choreography from a global
viewpoint. The choreography can then be automatically compiled (projected) to a
correct implementation for each participant.
  Choreographic programming relieves the programmer from manually writing the
separate send and receive actions performed by participants and avoids the
problem of communication mismatches. However, the applicability of this
paradigm in the real world remains largely unexplored for two reasons. First,
while there have been several proposals of choreographic programming languages,
none of them have been used to implement a realistic, widely-used protocol.
Thus there is a lack of experience on how realistic choreographic programs are
structured and on the relevance of the features explored in theoretical models.
Second, applications of choreographic programming shown so far are intrusive
since each participant must use exactly the code projected from the
choreography. This prevents using the projected code with existing third-party
implementations of some participants.
  We carry out the first development in choreographic programming of a
widespread real-world protocol: the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol. Our
development is based on Choral, an object-oriented choreographic programming
language. Two of Choral's features are key to our implementation: higher-order
choreographies for modelling the complex interaction patterns due to IRC's
asynchronous nature; and user-definable communication semantics for achieving
interoperability with third-party implementations. We also discover a missing
piece: the capability of statically detecting that choices on alternative
distributed behaviours are appropriately communicated by means of message
types. We extend the Choral compiler with an elegant solution based on
subtyping.

such problems, the total number of decision stages may be huge. In this paper,
we consider multistage stochastic optimization problems with two time-scales,

More precisely, our approach relies on two assumptions. On the one hand, we
suppose slow time scale stagewise independence of the noise process: the random

at another slow time scale interval. This makes it possible to use Dynamic
Programming at the slow time scale. On the other hand, we suppose a dynamically
monotone property for the problem under consideration, which makes it possible
to obtain bounds. Then, we present two algorithmic methods to compute upper and
lower bounds for slow time scale Bellman value functions. Both methods rely
respectively on primal and dual decomposition of the Bellman equation applied

fail to generate high-fidelity dubbing results. To address the above problem,
this paper proposes a Deformation Inpainting Network (DINet) for
high-resolution face visually dubbing. Different from previous works relying on
multiple up-sample layers to directly generate pixels from latent embeddings,
DINet performs spatial deformation on feature maps of reference images to
better preserve high-frequency textural details. Specifically, DINet consists
of one deformation part and one inpainting part. In the first part, five
reference facial images adaptively perform spatial deformation to create
deformed feature maps encoding mouth shapes at each frame, in order to align
with the input driving audio and also the head poses of the input source
images. In the second part, to produce face visually dubbing, a feature decoder
is responsible for adaptively incorporating mouth movements from the deformed
feature maps and other attributes (i.e., head pose and upper facial expression)
from the source feature maps together. Finally, DINet achieves face visually
dubbing with rich textural details. We conduct qualitative and quantitative
comparisons to validate our DINet on high-resolution videos. The experimental
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art works.

rare. On the other hand, binary evolutionary models predict that WR stars could
originate from primary stars in close binaries. We conduct an analysis of the
massive O star, AzV 14, to spectroscopically determine its fundamental and
stellar wind parameters, which are then used to investigate evolutionary paths
from the O-type to the WR stage with stellar evolutionary models. Multi-epoch
UV and optical spectra of AzV 14 are analyzed using the non-LTE stellar
atmosphere code PoWR. An optical TESS light curve was extracted and analyzed
using the PHOEBE code. The obtained parameters are put into an evolutionary
context, using the MESA code. AzV 14 is a close binary system consisting of two
similar main sequence stars with masses of 32 Msol. Both stars have weak
stellar winds with mass-loss rates of log $\dot{M}$ = -7.7. Binary evolutionary
models can explain the empirically derived stellar and orbital parameters. The
model predicts that the primary will evolve into a WR star with T = 100 kK,
while the secondary, which will accrete significant amounts of mass during the
first mass transfer phase, will become a cooler WR star with T = 50 kK and are
predicted to have compared to other WR stars increased oxygen abundances. This
model prediction is supported by a spectroscopic analysis of a WR star in the
SMC. We hypothesize that the populations of WR stars in low-Z galaxies may have
bimodal temperature distributions. Hotter WR stars might originate from primary
stars, while cooler WR stars are the evolutionary descendants of the secondary
stars if they accreted a significant amount of mass.

exoplanets because it affects the radial velocities. We analysed a large sample
of 177 M dwarfs observed with HARPS (2003-2020) in order to characterise the
long-term variability of these stars. We compared the variability obtained in
three chromospheric activity indices (Ca II H & K, the Na D doublet, and
Halpha) and with ASAS photometry. We focused on the detailed analysis of the
chromospheric emission based on linear, quadratic, and sinusoidal models. We
used various tools to estimate the significance of the variability and to
quantify the improvement brought by the models. In addition, we analysed
complementary photometric time series for the most variable stars to be able to
provide a broader view of the long-term variability in M dwarfs. We find that
most stars are significantly variable, even the quietest stars. Most stars in
our sample (75%) exhibit a long-term variability, which manifests itself mostly
through linear or quadratic variability, although the true behaviour may be
more complex. We found significant variability with estimated timescales for 24
stars, and estimated the lower limit for a possible cycle period for an
additional 9 stars that were not previously published. We found evidence of
complex variability because more than one long-term timescale may be present
for at least 12 stars, together with significant differences between the
behaviour of the three activity indices. This complexity may also be the source
of the discrepancies observed between previous publications. We conclude that
long-term variability is present for all spectral types and activity level in M
dwarfs, without a significant trend with spectral type or mean activity level.

better scalability. Providing the monitoring option, Bokun's programming is

of Bokun mesh enabled by an optimal optical depth is also more resilient to the

Given a graph $F$ with no isolated vertices. Consider the following game played
on the complete graph $K_n$ by two players Alice and Bob. First, Alice colors
one of the edges of $K_n$ blue, then Bob colors a different edge red, and so
on. The first player who can complete the formation of $F$ in his color is the
winner. The minimum $n$ for which Alice has a winning strategy is the
achievement number of $F$, denoted by $a(F)$. If we replace $K_n$ in the game
by the completed bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$, we get the bipartite achievement
number, denoted by $\operatorname{ba}(F)$. In his seminal paper, Harary
proposed an open problem of determining bipartite achievement numbers for
trees. In this paper, we correct $\operatorname{ba}(mK_2)=m+1$ to $m$ and
disprove $\operatorname{ba}(K_{1,m})=2m-2$ from Erickson and Harary, and extend
their results on bipartite achievement numbers. We also find the exact values
of achievement numbers for matchings, and the exact values or upper and lower
bounds of bipartite achievement numbers on matchings, stars, and double stars.
Our upper bounds are obtained by deriving efficient winning strategies for
Alice.

distributions and properties of systems in several areas of physics.
Considering two-body scattering at low energies, when the de Broglie wavelength
is larger than the range of the potential, partial waves with high angular
momentum are typically unimportant. The dominant contribution comes from $l=0$
partial waves, commonly known as $s$-wave scattering. This situation is very
relevant in atomic physics, e.g. cold atomic gases, and nuclear physics, e.g.
nuclear structure and matter. This manuscript is intended as a pedagogical
introduction to the topic while covering a numerical approach to compute the
desired quantities. We introduce low-energy scattering with particular
attention to the concepts of scattering length and effective range. These two
quantities appear in the effective-range approximation, which universally
describes low-energy processes. We outline a numerical procedure for
calculating the scattering length and effective range of spherically symmetric
two-body potentials. As examples, we apply the method to the spherical well,
modified P\""oschl-Teller, Gaussian, and Lennard-Jones potentials. We hope to
provide the tools so students can implement similar calculations and extend
them to other potentials.

scaCSP based on the scatter matrices of spatial covariances of EEG signals,
which works generally in both binary and multi-class problems whereas CSP can
be cast into our framework as a special case when only the range space of the
between-class scatter matrix is used in binary cases.We further propose
subspace enhanced scaCSP algorithms which easily permit incorporating more

the between-class and within-class scatter matrices in two scenarios: a
nullspace components reduction scenario and an additional spatial filter
learning scenario.The proposed algorithms are evaluated on two data sets
including 4 MI tasks. The classification performance is compared against
state-of-the-art competing algorithms: CSP, Tikhonov regularized CSP (TRCSP),
stationary CSP (sCSP) and stationary TRCSP (sTRCSP) in the binary problems
whilst multi-class extensions of CSP based on pair-wise and one-versus-rest
techniques in the multi-class problems. The results show that the proposed
framework outperforms all the competing algorithms in terms of average

model for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for German to evaluate the current
potential of this technology for the use in the larger context of Digital
Humanities and cultural heritage indexation. Along with this paper we publish
our wav2vec2 based speech to text model while we evaluate its performance on a
corpus of historical recordings we assembled compared against commercial
cloud-based and proprietary services. While our model achieves moderate
results, we see that proprietary cloud services fare significantly better. As
our results show, recognition rates over 90 percent can currently be achieved,
however, these numbers drop quickly once the recordings feature limited audio
quality or use of non-every day or outworn language. A big issue is the high
variety of different dialects and accents in the German language. Nevertheless,
this paper highlights that the currently available quality of recognition is
high enough to address various use cases in the Digital Humanities. We argue
that ASR will become a key technology for the documentation and analysis of
audio-visual sources and identify an array of important questions that the DH
community and cultural heritage stakeholders will have to address in the near
future.

consisting of nanometer size bubbles of a new speculated vacuum phase in which
some ordinary material, e.g. carbon, is present under high pressure caused by
the surface tension of the domain wall surrounding the bubble. These bubbles or
pearls are surrounded by dust grains, and it is one of the new points of the
present article that this dust grain rather than being a three dimensional blob
of ordinary matter is a lower dimensional object of some lower Hausdorff
dimension. We make several order of magnitude fits and find rather good
agreement for our model. However, we must imagine that the very high - 3.5 kev
- homolumo gap assumed present in the highly compressed medium inside the
bubble has influenced the neighboring dust, so as to make it significantly
harder than usual dust. This is to ensure that we obtain the correct order of
magnitude for the velocity in the region where the ratio cross section over
mass falls drastically.The dark matter pearls loose their dust when impacting
the Earth and the shielding. They must reach down with their terminal velocity
through the shielding to the Dama observatory in less than a year, so that
there is no problem in obtaining the seasonal variation effect the Dama
experiment has observed. This is easier to achieve with a sufficiently high
pearl mass and this mass is not so strongly restricted once the dust grain is
lower dimensional.

flexibility, fast charge and discharge, low loss, and graceful failure.
Elevating the use of polymeric dielectric capacitors for advanced energy
applications such as electric vehicles (EVs) however requires significant
enhancement of their energy densities. Here, we report a polymer thin film
heterostructure based capacitor of poly(vinylidene fluoride)/poly(methyl
methacrylate) with stratified 2D nanofillers (Mica or h-BN nanosheets)
(PVDF/PMMA-2D fillers/PVDF), that shows enhanced permittivity, high dielectric
strength and an ultra-high energy density of 75 J/cm3 with efficiency over 79%.
Density functional theory calculations verify the observed permittivity
enhancement. This approach of using oriented 2D nanofillers based polymer
heterostructure composites is expected to be universal for designing high
energy density thin film polymeric dielectric capacitors for myriads of
applications.

computationally intensive process that has long been challenging in particle
physics. Despite the ability of deep generative models to make this process
more cost-efficient, ultra-high-resolution detector simulation still proves to
be difficult as it contains correlated and fine-grained mutual information
within an event. To overcome these limitations, we propose Intra-Event Aware
GAN (IEA-GAN), a novel fusion of Self-Supervised Learning and Generative
Adversarial Networks. IEA-GAN presents a Relational Reasoning Module that
approximates the concept of an ''event'' in detector simulation, allowing for
the generation of correlated layer-dependent contextualized images for
high-resolution detector responses with a proper relational inductive bias.
IEA-GAN also introduces a new intra-event aware loss and a Uniformity loss,
resulting in significant enhancements to image fidelity and diversity. We
demonstrate IEA-GAN's application in generating sensor-dependent images for the
high-granularity Pixel Vertex Detector (PXD), with more than 7.5M information
channels and a non-trivial geometry, at the Belle II Experiment. Applications
of this work include controllable simulation-based inference and event
generation, high-granularity detector simulation such as at the HL-LHC (High
Luminosity LHC), and fine-grained density estimation and sampling. To the best
of our knowledge, IEA-GAN is the first algorithm for faithful
ultra-high-resolution detector simulation with event-based reasoning.

latent-variable deep generative models that extends the VAE to model a sequence
of observed data and a corresponding sequence of latent vectors. In almost all
the DVAEs of the literature, the temporal dependencies within each sequence and
across the two sequences are modeled with recurrent neural networks. In this
paper, we propose to model speech signals with the Hierarchical Transformer
DVAE (HiT-DVAE), which is a DVAE with two levels of latent variable
(sequence-wise and frame-wise) and in which the temporal dependencies are
implemented with the Transformer architecture. We show that HiT-DVAE
outperforms several other DVAEs for speech spectrogram modeling, while enabling
a simpler training procedure, revealing its high potential for downstream
low-level speech processing tasks such as speech enhancement.

variations in spatiotemporal domains. To the best of our knowledge, the

setting of GAR using the encoders in video transformers. Furthermore, using the
advantage of transformer models, our proposed approach supports long-term
relationship modeling along spatio-temporal dimensions. The proposed SPARTAN

  arXiv:2111.03186 by other authors",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently found applications
in image editing, most previous GAN-based image editing methods require
largescale datasets with semantic segmentation annotations for training, only
provide high level control, or merely interpolate between different images.
Previous researchers have proposed EditGAN for high-quality, high-precision
semantic image editing with limited semantic annotations by finding `editing
vectors'. However, it is noticed that there are many features that are not
highly associated with semantics, and EditGAN may fail on them. Based on the
orthogonality of latent space observed by EditGAN, we propose a method to
estimate editing vectors that do not rely on semantic segmentation nor
differentiable feature estimation network. Our method assumes that there is a
correlation between the intensity distribution of features and the distribution
of hidden vectors, and estimates the relationship between the above
distributions by sampling the feature intensity of the image corresponding to
several hidden vectors. We modified Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to deal
with both binary feature editing and continuous feature editing. We then found
that this method has a good effect in processing features such as clothing type
and texture, skin color and hair.

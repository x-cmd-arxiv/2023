Subject cough event detection is the foundation for continuous cough
monitoring. Recently, the rapid growth in smart hearables has opened new
opportunities for such needs. This paper proposes EarCough, which enables
continuous subject cough event detection on edge computing hearables by
leveraging the always-on active noise cancellation (ANC) microphones.
Specifically, we proposed a lightweight end-to-end neural network model --
EarCoughNet. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we constructed a
synchronous motion and audio dataset through a user study. Results show that
EarCough achieved an accuracy of 95.4% and an F1-score of 92.9% with a space
requirement of only 385 kB. We envision EarCough as a low-cost add-on for
future hearables to enable continuous subject cough event detection.

learnable time-frequency representation. We pass each audio signal through a
bank of convolutional filters, each giving a fixed-dimensional vector. It is
akin to learning a bank of finite impulse-response filterbanks and passing the

more broadly applicable, beyond the experiments in this paper.

in varied environments, Video Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (VUDA) has been
introduced to improve the robustness and transferability of video models.
However, current VUDA methods rely on a vast amount of high-quality unlabeled
target data, which may not be available in real-world cases. We thus consider a
more realistic \textit{Few-Shot Video-based Domain Adaptation} (FSVDA) scenario
where we adapt video models with only a few target video samples. While a few
methods have touched upon Few-Shot Domain Adaptation (FSDA) in images and in
FSVDA, they rely primarily on spatial augmentation for target domain expansion
with alignment performed statistically at the instance level. However, videos
contain more knowledge in terms of rich temporal and semantic information,
which should be fully considered while augmenting target domains and performing
alignment in FSVDA. We propose a novel SSA2lign to address FSVDA at the snippet
level, where the target domain is expanded through a simple snippet-level
augmentation followed by the attentive alignment of snippets both semantically
and statistically, where semantic alignment of snippets is conducted through
multiple perspectives. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art

is required to adapt to a series of individually available changing target
domains continuously without source data or target supervision. It has wide
applications, such as robotic vision and autonomous driving. The main
underlying challenge of CVDA is to learn helpful information only from the
unsupervised target data while avoiding forgetting previously learned knowledge
catastrophically, which is out of the capability of previous Video-based
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation methods. Therefore, we propose a
Confidence-Attentive network with geneRalization enhanced self-knowledge
disTillation (CART) to address the challenge in CVDA. Firstly, to learn from
unsupervised domains, we propose to learn from pseudo labels. However, in
continuous adaptation, prediction errors can accumulate rapidly in pseudo
labels, and CART effectively tackles this problem with two key modules.
Specifically, The first module generates refined pseudo labels using model
predictions and deploys a novel attentive learning strategy. The second module
compares the outputs of augmented data from the current model to the outputs of
weakly augmented data from the source model, forming a novel consistency
regularization on the model to alleviate the accumulation of prediction errors.
Extensive experiments suggest that the CVDA performance of CART outperforms
existing methods by a considerable margin.

desirable that such capabilities be realized through logic-based devices. We
describe an approach for doing this here. In our scheme a module corresponds to
a block of code whose external view is mediated by a signature. Thus,
signatures impose a form of hiding that is explained logically via existential
quantifications over predicate, function and constant names. Modules interact
through the mechanism of accumulation that translates into conjoining the

necessary. The module capabilities we present have previously been implemented
via the compile-time inlining of accumulated modules. This approach does not
support separate compilation. We redress this situation by showing how each
distinct module can be compiled separately and inlining can be realized by a
later, complementary and equally efficient linking phase.

considerations about the optimal strategy for training DNNs, such as whether to
fine-tune them with each chunk of incoming data (warm-start) or to retrain them
from scratch with the entire corpus of data whenever a new chunk is available.
While employing the latter for training can be resource-intensive, recent work
has pointed out the lack of generalization in warm-start models. Therefore, to
strike a balance between efficiency and generalization, we introduce Learn,
Unlearn, and Relearn (LURE) an online learning paradigm for DNNs. LURE
interchanges between the unlearning phase, which selectively forgets the
undesirable information in the model through weight reinitialization in a
data-dependent manner, and the relearning phase, which emphasizes learning on
generalizable features. We show that our training paradigm provides consistent
performance gains across datasets in both classification and few-shot settings.

The key to MM-CTTA is to adaptively attend to the reliable modality while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting during continual domain shifts, which is out

propose an MM-CTTA method called Continual Cross-Modal Adaptive Clustering

an adaptive dual-stage mechanism to generate reliable cross-modal predictions
by attending to the reliable modality based on the class-wise feature-centroid
distance in the latent space. On the other hand, to perform test-time
adaptation without catastrophic forgetting, we design class-wise momentum
queues that capture confident target features for adaptation while
stochastically restoring pseudo-source features to revisit source knowledge. We
further introduce two new benchmarks to facilitate the exploration of MM-CTTA
in the future. Our experimental results show that our method achieves

breakthroughs in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Instead of directly
training on a downstream task, language models are first pre-trained on large

fine-tuned on task-specific data (e.g., natural language generation, text

performance of LLMs, but unfortunately, this also leads to highly prohibitive
computational costs. Pre-training LLMs often require orders of magnitude more
FLOPs than fine-tuning and the model capacity often remains the same between
the two phases. To achieve training efficiency w.r.t training FLOPs, we propose
to decouple the model capacity between the two phases and introduce Sparse
Pre-training and Dense Fine-tuning (SPDF). In this work, we show the benefits
of using unstructured weight sparsity to train only a subset of weights during
pre-training (Sparse Pre-training) and then recover the representational
capacity by allowing the zeroed weights to learn (Dense Fine-tuning). We
demonstrate that we can induce up to 75% sparsity into a 1.3B parameter GPT-3
XL model resulting in a 2.5x reduction in pre-training FLOPs, without a
significant loss in accuracy on the downstream tasks relative to the dense
baseline. By rigorously evaluating multiple downstream tasks, we also establish
a relationship between sparsity, task complexity, and dataset size. Our work
presents a promising direction to train large GPT models at a fraction of the
training FLOPs using weight sparsity while retaining the benefits of
pre-trained textual representations for downstream tasks.

resolving an open problem in the survey (Ramkumar et al., Foundations and

propose another class of explicit MSR code constructions (not optimal-access)

problem in the survey. Previously, MSR codes with $\ell=s^{\left\lceil

The key insight that enables a linear field size in our construction is to
reduce $\binom{n}{r}$ global constraints of non-vanishing determinants to
$O_s(n)$ local ones, which is achieved by carefully designing the parity check

increasing need for a secure, scalable, and trustworthy data-sharing ecosystem
that promotes and rewards collaborative data-sharing efforts among researchers,
and a robust incentive mechanism is required to achieve this objective.
Reputation-based incentives, such as the h-index, have historically played a
pivotal role in the academic community. However, the h-index suffers from
several limitations. This paper introduces the SCIENCE-index, a
blockchain-based metric measuring a researcher's scientific contributions.
Utilizing the Microsoft Academic Graph and machine learning techniques, the
SCIENCE-index predicts the progress made by a researcher over their career and
provides a soft incentive for sharing their datasets with peer researchers. To
incentivize researchers to share their data, the SCIENCE-index is augmented to
include a data-sharing parameter. DataCite, a database of openly available
datasets, proxies this parameter, which is further enhanced by including a
researcher's data-sharing activity. Our model is evaluated by comparing the
distribution of its output for geographically diverse researchers to that of
the h-index. We observe that it results in a much more even spread of
evaluations. The SCIENCE-index is a crucial component in constructing a
decentralized protocol that promotes trust-based data sharing, addressing the
current inequity in dataset sharing. The work outlined in this paper provides
the foundation for assessing scientific contributions in future data-sharing
spaces powered by decentralized applications.

a strain rate of $5\cdot10^{-4}/s$ the evolution of microcracks in the C36
Laves phase governs damage formation. However , when the strain rate is
decreased to $5\cdot10^{-6}/s$, interface decohesion at the $\alpha$-Mg/Laves
phase interfaces becomes equally important. We also observe a change in crack
orientation indicating an increasing influence of plastic co-deformation of the

Inspired by humans' reasoning of the visual world, we tackle the aforementioned
challenges from a compositional perspective, and propose an integral framework
consisting of a principled object factorization method and a novel neural
module network. Our factorization method decomposes objects based on their key
characteristics, and automatically derives prototypes that represent a wide
range of objects. With these prototypes encoding important semantics, the
proposed network then correlates objects by measuring their similarity on a
common semantic space and makes decisions with a compositional reasoning
process. It is capable of answering questions with diverse objects regardless

question-answer distributions. In addition to the enhanced generalizability,
our framework also provides an interpretable interface for understanding the

time, as specified by a Brownian functional known as the boundary local time
$\ell(t)$. If the rate of adsorption is state dependent, then the adsorption
process is non-Markovian, reflecting the fact that surface
activation/deactivation proceeds progressively by repeated particle encounters.
The generalized adsorption event is identified as the first time that the local
time crosses a randomly generated threshold. Different models of adsorption
(Markovian and non-Markovian) then correspond to different choices for the
random threshold probability density $\psi(\ell)$. The marginal probability
density for particle position $\X(t)$ prior to absorption depends on $\psi$ and
the joint probability density for the pair $(\X(t),\ell(t))$, also known as the
local time propagator. In the case of normal diffusion one can use a
Feynman-Kac formula to derive an evolution equation for the propagator. Here we
derive the local time propagator equation for fractional diffusion by taking a
continuum limit of a heavy-tailed continuous-time random walk (CTRW). We use
our encounter-based model to investigate the effects of subdiffusion and
non-Markovian adsorption on the long-time behavior of the first passage time
(FPT) density in a finite interval $[0,L]$ with a reflecting boundary at $x=L$.
In particular, we determine how the choice of function $\psi$ affects the
large-$t$ power law decay of the FPT density. Finally, we indicate how to
extend the model to higher spatial dimensions.

only absorbed within $\calU$. We take the probability of absorption to depend
on the amount of time a particle spends within the trap, which is specified by
a Brownian functional known as the occupation time $A(t)$. The first passage
time (FPT) for absorption is identified with the point at which the occupation
time crosses a random threshold $\widehat{A}$ with probability density
$\psi(a)$. Non-Markovian models of absorption can then be incorporated by
taking $\psi(a)$ to be non-exponential. The marginal probability density for
particle position $\X(t)$ prior to absorption depends on $\psi$ and the joint
probability density for the pair $(\X(t),A(t))$, also known as the occupation
time propagator. In the case of normal diffusion one can use a Feynman-Kac
formula to derive an evolution equation for the propagator. However, care must
be taken when combining fractional diffusion with chemical reactions in the
same medium. Therefore, we derive the occupation time propagator equation from
first principles by taking the continuum limit of a heavy-tailed CTRW. We then
use the solution of the propagator equation to investigate conditions under
which the mean FPT (MFPT) for absorption within a trap is finite. We show that
this depends on the choice of threshold density $\psi(a)$ and the
subdiffusivity. Hence, as previously found for evanescent reaction-subdiffusion

paper, we give a formula valid in the asymptotic sector $x/t \in (1,M]$, where

Combined with earlier results, this validates the soliton resolution conjecture
for the Boussinesq equation everywhere in the $(x,t)$-plane except in a number
of small transition zones.

  bounded domains","23 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diffusion in heterogeneous media partitioned by semi-permeable interfaces has
a wide range of applications in the physical and life sciences, including gas
permeation in soils, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI), drug
delivery, thermal conduction in composite media, synaptic receptor trafficking,
and intercellular gap junctions. At the single particle level, diffusion across
a semi-permeable interface can be formulated in terms of so-called snapping out
Brownian motion (SNOBM). The latter sews together successive rounds of
reflected BM, each of which is restricted to one side of the interface. Each
round of reflected BM is killed when the local time at the interface exceeds an
independent, exponentially distributed random variable. (The local time
specifies the amount of time a reflected Brownian particle spends in a
neighborhood of the interface.) The particle then immediately resumes reflected
BM on the same side or the other side of the interface according to a
stochastic switch, and the process is iterated. In this paper, we develop a
Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating a two-dimensional version of SNOBM, which
is used to solve a first passage time (FPT) problem for diffusion in a domain
with semi-permeable partially absorbing traps. Our method combines a
walk-on-spheres (WOS) method with an efficient algorithm for computing the
boundary local time that uses a Skorokhod integral representation of the
latter. We validate our algorithm by comparing the Monte Carlo estimates of the
MFPT to the exact solution for a single circular trap, and show that our
simulations are consistent with asymptotic results obtained for the 2D narrow
capture problem involving multiple small circular targets. We also discuss
extensions to higher dimensions.

an input buggy program. Traditional APR tools typically focus on specific bug
types and fixes through the use of templates, heuristics, and formal
specifications. However, these techniques are limited in terms of the bug types
and patch variety they can produce. As such, researchers have designed various
learning-based APR tools with recent work focused on directly using Large
Language Models (LLMs) for APR. While LLM-based APR tools are able to achieve
state-of-the-art performance on many repair datasets, the LLMs used for direct
repair are not fully aware of the project-specific information such as unique
variable or method names.
  The plastic surgery hypothesis is a well-known insight for APR, which states
that the code ingredients to fix the bug usually already exist within the same
project. Traditional APR tools have largely leveraged the plastic surgery
hypothesis by designing manual or heuristic-based approaches to exploit such
existing code ingredients. However, as recent APR research starts focusing on
LLM-based approaches, the plastic surgery hypothesis has been largely ignored.
In this paper, we ask the following question: How useful is the plastic surgery
hypothesis in the era of LLMs? Interestingly, LLM-based APR presents a unique
opportunity to fully automate the plastic surgery hypothesis via fine-tuning
and prompting. To this end, we propose FitRepair, which combines the direct
usage of LLMs with two domain-specific fine-tuning strategies and one prompting
strategy for more powerful APR. Our experiments on the widely studied Defects4j
1.2 and 2.0 datasets show that FitRepair fixes 89 and 44 bugs (substantially
outperforming the best-performing baseline by 15 and 8), respectively,

study was to quantify longitudinal representativeness of the demographic
characteristics of the primary imaging dataset compared to the United States
general population (US Census) and COVID-19 positive case counts from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Approach: The Jensen Shannon
distance (JSD) was used to longitudinally measure the similarity of the
distribution of (1) all unique patients in the MIDRC data to the 2020 US Census
and (2) all unique COVID-19 positive patients in the MIDRC data to the case
counts reported by the CDC. The distributions were evaluated in the demographic
categories of age at index, sex, race, ethnicity, and the intersection of race
and ethnicity. Results: Representativeness the MIDRC data by ethnicity and the
intersection of race and ethnicity was impacted by the percentage of CDC case
counts for which data in these categories is not reported. The distributions by
sex and race have retained their level of representativeness over time.
Conclusion: The representativeness of the open medical imaging datasets in the
curated public data commons at MIDRC has evolved over time as both the number
of contributing institutions and overall number of subjects has grown. The use
of metrics such as the JSD support measurement of representativeness, one step
needed for fair and generalizable AI algorithm development.

involve vector or matrix gains, PDE models involve functions in those roles
functional coefficients, dependent on the spatial variables, and gain functions
dependent on space as well. The designs of gains for controllers and observers
for PDEs, such as PDE backstepping, are mappings of system model functions into
gain functions. These infinite dimensional nonlinear operators are given in an
implicit form through PDEs, in spatial variables, which need to be solved to
determine the gain function for each new functional coefficient of the PDE. The
need for solving such PDEs can be eliminated by learning and approximating the
said design mapping in the form of a neural operator. Learning the neural
operator requires a sufficient number of prior solutions for the design PDEs,
offline, as well as the training of the operator. In recent work, we developed
the neural operators for PDE backstepping designs for first order hyperbolic
PDEs. Here we extend this framework to the more complex class of parabolic
PDEs. The key theoretical question is whether the controllers are still
stabilizing, and whether the observers are still convergent, if they employ the
approximate functional gains generated by the neural operator. We provide
affirmative answers to these questions, namely, we prove stability in closed
loop under gains produced by neural operators. We illustrate the theoretical
results with numerical tests and publish our code on github. The neural
operators are three orders of magnitude faster in generating gain functions
than PDE solvers for such gain functions. This opens up the opportunity for the
use of this neural operator methodology in adaptive control and in gain
scheduling control for nonlinear PDEs.

an important paradigm in NLP. However, common practice fine-tunes all of the
parameters in a pre-trained model, which becomes prohibitive when a large
number of downstream tasks are present. Therefore, many fine-tuning methods are
proposed to learn incremental updates of pre-trained weights in a parameter
efficient way, e.g., low-rank increments. These methods often evenly distribute
the budget of incremental updates across all pre-trained weight matrices, and
overlook the varying importance of different weight parameters. As a
consequence, the fine-tuning performance is suboptimal. To bridge this gap, we
propose AdaLoRA, which adaptively allocates the parameter budget among weight
matrices according to their importance score. In particular, AdaLoRA
parameterizes the incremental updates in the form of singular value
decomposition. Such a novel approach allows us to effectively prune the
singular values of unimportant updates, which is essentially to reduce their
parameter budget but circumvent intensive exact SVD computations. We conduct
extensive experiments with several pre-trained models on natural language
processing, question answering, and natural language generation to validate the
effectiveness of AdaLoRA. Results demonstrate that AdaLoRA manifests notable
improvement over baselines, especially in the low budget settings. Our code is

since the ordered features are important in guiding subsequent research.
Feature rankings may be distorted by influential points (IP), but such effects
are rarely mentioned in previous studies. This study aimed to investigate the
impact of IPs on feature rankings and propose a new method to detect IPs.
Method The present study utilized a case-deletion (i.e., leave-one-out)
approach to assess the impact of cases. The influence of a case was measured by
comparing the rank changes before and after the deletion of that case. We
proposed a rank comparison method using adaptive top-prioritized weights that
highlighted the rank changes of the top-ranked features. The weights were
adjustable to the distribution of rank changes. Results Potential IPs could be
observed in several datasets. The presence of IPs could significantly alter the
results of the following analysis (e.g., enriched pathways), suggesting the
necessity of IPs detection when deriving feature rankings. Compared with
existing methods, the novel rank comparison method could identify rank changes
of important (top-ranked) features because of employing the adaptive weights
adjusted to the distribution of rank changes. Conclusions IPs detection should
be routinely performed when deriving feature rankings. The new method for IPs
detection exhibited favorable features compared with existing methods.

technique for monitoring the skin's conditions, early detection of the human
skin cancer, and recovery from burns and wounds. It can be applied for
visualization of healing process directly through clinical dressings and
restorative ointments, minimizing the frequency of dressing changes. The THz
imaging technique is cost effective, as compared to the magnetic resonance
method. Our aim was to develop an approach capable of providing better image
resolution than the commercially available THz imaging cameras. Approach: The
terahertz-to-infrared (THz-to-IR) converters can visualize the human skin
cancer by converting the latter's specific contrast patterns recognizable in
THz radiation range into IR patterns, detectable by a standard IR imaging
camera. At the core of suggested THz-to-IR converters are flat matrices
transparent both in the THz range to be visualized and in the operating range
of the IR camera; these matrices contain embedded metal nanoparticles, which,
when irradiated with THz rays, convert the energy of THz photons into heat and
become nanosources of IR radiation detectable by an IR camera. Results: The
ways of creating the simplest converter, as well as a more complex converter
with wider capabilities, are considered. The first converter is a gelatin
matrix with gold 8.5 nm diameter nanoparticles, the second is a polystyrene
matrix with 2 nm diameter nanoparticles from copper-nickel MONEL (c) alloy 404.
Conclusions: An approach with a THz-to-IR converter equipped with an IR camera
is promising in that it could provide a better image of oncological pathology
than the commercially available THz imaging cameras do.

the spatial arrangement and distribution of microstructure and their influence
in the plastic inhomogeneity of Inconel 718 fabricated by additive
manufacturing (AM). In particular, the density and spatial distribution of
geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) and the crystallographic texture
components were examined in relation to the spatial plastic deformation.
In-situ tensile testing coupled with microscopy and EBSD was performed to
understand the evolution of the as-built microstructure and its effect on the
spatial and temporal deformation behaviour. Bidirectional scan strategy with no
interlayer rotation resulted in highly ordered alternating arrangements of
coarse Goss-like {110}<001> textured grains separated by fine Cube-like
{100}<001> textured grains. This strategy also resulted in an overall high
density of dislocations (in particular GNDs) with a regular pattern: the fine
grains contained very high GND density while the coarse grains contained less
GNDs but they were oriented to be perpendicular to the scan direction. Although
this strategy resulted in a dominant Cube texture that is desirable for
isotropy, the Cube texture gradually weakened and the undesirable Goss
component increased during plastic deformation. Together with the columnar
grain morphology and aligned GND arrangement, such texture evolution caused
intense plastic inhomogeneity during deformation. Replacing the bidirectional
strategy with a chessboard strategy involving a 67{\deg} layer rotation
resulted in a lower GND density and much more random distribution of
crystallographic texture and GNDs, with a dominant Cube component (and lower
Goss texture) that remained stable throughout plastic deformation, reducing the
plastic inhomogeneity.

router responsible for forwarding packets between the dimensions as well as the

routing algorithm, there are important trade-offs between routing performance
and the efficiency of overcoming potential deadlocks. Common deadlock avoidance
techniques including the turn model usually involve restrictions of certain
paths a packet can take at the cost of a higher probability for network
congestion. In contrast, deadlock resolution techniques, as well as some
avoidance schemes, provide more path flexibility at the expense of hardware
complexity, such as by incorporating (or assuming) dedicated buffers.
  This paper provides a deadlock avoidance algorithm for NoC routers based on

features fewer path restrictions than common techniques, and can be based on
existing routing algorithms as a baseline, deadlock-free or not. This requires
no modification to the queueing topology, and the required logic is minimal.
Our algorithm approaches the performance of fully-adaptive algorithms, while

This thesis focuses on the
relation between the diproton correlation and the two-proton emission with
quantum entanglement. For this purpose, I developed a time-dependent three-body
(proton-proton-core) model, where one Cooper pair of protons move inside the
mean-field potential. The time-dependent calculation based on the three-body
model provides an intuitive way to describe the quantum dynamics of the
entangled fermionic pair. It has been shown that, by considering the
Cooper-pairing correlation in the initial state of the two protons, (i) the
experimental 2p-decay width of Be-6 is well reproduced, and (ii) the two
protons are emitted mainly as a diproton-like cluster with the spin-singlet
configuration in the early stage of the emission. Hence, the two-proton
emission can provide an access to the diproton correlation. This thesis
presented the first step to theoretically investigate the diproton correlation
as well as quantum entanglement in the time-dependent radioactive emission.

modality volume, a 3D sliding kernel was implemented across the brain to
capture image heterogeneity: fifty-six radiomic features were extracted within
the kernel, resulting in a 4th order tensor. Each radiomic feature can then be
encoded as a 3D image volume, namely a radiomic feature map (RFM). PCA was
employed for data dimension reduction and the first 4 PCs were selected. Four
deep neural networks as sub-models following the U-Net architecture were
trained for the segmenting of a region-of-interest (ROI): each sub-model
utilizes the mp-MRI and 1 of the 4 PCs as a 5-channel input for a 2D execution.

general sub-Weibull distribution assumptions on the jump process. The proposed
estimators employ the computationally efficient least angle regression
algorithm for estimation purposes, followed by a reduced dynamic programming
step to refine the final number of change points. In terms of numerical
performance, the proposed estimators are computationally fast and accurately
identify breakpoints near the end of the sample, which is highly desirable in
today's electronic trading environment. In terms of out-of-sample volatility
prediction, our new estimators provide more realistic and smoother volatility
forecasts, and they outperform a wide range of classical and recent volatility
estimators across various frequencies and forecasting horizons.

proposes Feature Flow Net (FFNet), a novel cooperative detection framework that
uses a feature flow prediction module to address these issues in
vehicle-infrastructure cooperative 3D object detection. Rather than
transmitting feature maps extracted from still-images, FFNet transmits feature
flow, which leverages the temporal coherence of sequential infrastructure
frames to predict future features and compensate for asynchrony. Additionally,
we introduce a self-supervised approach to enable FFNet to generate feature
flow with feature prediction ability. Experimental results demonstrate that our

its inclusion of a self-interaction term helps to prevent mode collapse and
captures all modes of distribution. To overcome the difficulty of the
relatively scattered distribution of high-dimensional data, we first map the
data into a latent feature space and approximate the feature distribution
instead of the data distribution. We adopt the GAN framework and replace the
discriminator with a feature transformation network to map the data into a

transformation network, which effectively addresses the issue of unstable

long- and wide-range 3D sensing, which directly benefited the recent rapid
deployment of autonomous driving (AD). Meanwhile, such a safety-critical
application strongly motivates its security research. A recent line of research
demonstrates that one can manipulate the LiDAR point cloud and fool object
detection by firing malicious lasers against LiDAR. However, these efforts face
3 critical research gaps: (1) evaluating only on a specific LiDAR (VLP-16); (2)
assuming unvalidated attack capabilities; and (3) evaluating with models
trained on limited datasets.
  To fill these critical research gaps, we conduct the first large-scale
measurement study on LiDAR spoofing attack capabilities on object detectors
with 9 popular LiDARs in total and 3 major types of object detectors. To
perform this measurement, we significantly improved the LiDAR spoofing
capability with more careful optics and functional electronics, which allows us
to be the first to clearly demonstrate and quantify key attack capabilities
assumed in prior works. However, we further find that such key assumptions
actually can no longer hold for all the other (8 out of 9) LiDARs that are more
recent than VLP-16 due to various recent LiDAR features. To this end, we
further identify a new type of LiDAR spoofing attack that can improve on this
and be applicable to a much more general and recent set of LiDARs. We find that
its attack capability is enough to (1) cause end-to-end safety hazards in
simulated AD scenarios, and (2) remove real vehicles in the physical world. We
also discuss the defense side.

model the output features of wav2vec2.0 as the vertices of a graph, and
construct the graph adjacency matrix by graph attention network (GAT). Finally,

the brightness of the moonlight no longer precluded observations. We derive
differential and integral upper limits using H.E.S.S. data from the third,

flux upper limit of $\Phi_\mathrm{UL}^{95\%} = 9.7 \times

constraints derived from the H.E.S.S. observations complement the available
multiwavelength data. The radio to X-ray data are consistent with synchrotron
emission from a single electron population, with the peak in the SED occurring
above the X-ray band. Compared to the VHE-bright GRB190829A, the upper limits
for GRB221009A imply a smaller gamma-ray to X-ray flux ratio in the afterglow.

to the multiwavelength picture of GRB221009A, effectively ruling out an IC

future projects. A crucial role is played by the recently discovered
short-range contribution to the NME, induced by light Majorana neutrino masses.
Depending on the NME model and the relative sign of the long- and short-range
contributions, the current $3\sigma$ bound can change between $m_{\beta\beta} <

relative sign of the long- and short-range contribution remains unknown, but
can become feasible if $m_{\beta\beta} \gtrsim 40$ meV and if the relative sign

analysis of hyperspectral image sequences. It reveals the dynamical evolution
of the materials (endmembers) and of their proportions (abundances) in a given
scene. However, adequately accounting for the spatial and temporal variability
of the endmembers in MTHU is challenging, and has not been fully addressed so
far in unsupervised frameworks. In this work, we propose an unsupervised MTHU
algorithm based on variational recurrent neural networks. First, a stochastic
model is proposed to represent both the dynamical evolution of the endmembers
and their abundances, as well as the mixing process. Moreover, a new model
based on a low-dimensional parametrization is used to represent spatial and
temporal endmember variability, significantly reducing the amount of variables
to be estimated. We propose to formulate MTHU as a Bayesian inference problem.
However, the solution to this problem does not have an analytical solution due
to the nonlinearity and non-Gaussianity of the model. Thus, we propose a
solution based on deep variational inference, in which the posterior
distribution of the estimated abundances and endmembers is represented by using
a combination of recurrent neural networks and a physically motivated model.
The parameters of the model are learned using stochastic backpropagation.
Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state of the art
MTHU algorithms.

collaborative grasping using under-actuated aerial manipulators (AMs). The AM
system is formulated, using a proper coordinate transformation, as an
inertially decoupled dynamics with which a passivity-based control design is
conducted. Since the interaction for grasping can be interpreted as a feedback
interconnection of passive systems, an arbitrary number of AMs can be modularly
combined, leading to a decentralized control scheme. Another interesting
consequence of the passivity property is that the AMs automatically converge to
a certain configuration to accomplish the grasping. Collaborative grasping
using 10 AMs is presented in simulation.

fingers in miscible displacement in a heterogeneous porous medium. The
statistical parameters characterizing the permeability distribution of a
reservoir vary over a wide range. The formation of fingers is provided by the
mixing of different-viscosity fluids -- water and polymer solution. The
distribution functions of the growth rate of viscous fingers are numerically
determined and visualized. Careful data processing reveals the non-monotonic
nature of the dependence of the front end of the mixing zone on the correlation
length of the permeability (describing the medium graininess) of the reservoir
formation. It is demonstrated that an increase in graininess up to a certain
value causes an expansion of the distribution shape and a shift of the
distribution maximum to the region of higher velocities. In addition, an
increase in the standard deviation of permeability leads to a slight change in
the shape and characteristics of the density distribution of the growth rates
of viscous fingers. The theoretical predictions within the framework of the
transverse flow equilibrium approximation and the Koval model are contrasted
with the numerically computed velocity distributions.

second order by explicit asymptotic solutions in the wave zone, and in the
interior of the light cone which satisfy novel matching conditions. In the
process we find novel compatibility conditions for the scattering data at null

  We also relate the asymptotics of the radiation field towards space-like
infinity to explicit homogeneous solutions in the exterior of the light cone.
This is the setting of slowly polynomially decaying data corresponding to mass,
charge and angular momentum in applications. We show that homogeneous data of
degree minus one and minus two for the wave equation results in the same
logarithmic terms on the lightcone and homogeneous asymptotics in the interior

reasonable for the model to address the similarity between the video snippet
and the language prompt at both the action and entity levels. To this end, a
motion encoder is proposed to capture the motion embeddings across different

two rounds of filtering operations guarantee that the dataset covers enough

development of new classes of applications driven by a huge number of emerging
networked devices. However, the success of Cloud computing has created a new
global energy challenge, as it comes at the cost of vast energy usage.
Currently, data centres hosting Cloud services world-wide consume more energy
than most countries. Globally, by 2025, they are projected to consume 20% of
global electricity and emit up to 5.5% of the world's carbon emissions. In
addition, a significant part of the energy consumed is transformed into heat
which leads to operational problems, including a reduction in system
reliability and the life expectancy of devices, and escalation in cooling
requirements. Therefore, for future generations of Cloud computing to address
the environmental and operational consequences of such significant energy
usage, they must become energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable while
continuing to deliver high-quality services.
  In this paper, we propose a vision for learning-centric approach for the
integrated management of new generation Cloud computing environments to reduce
their energy consumption and carbon footprint while delivering service quality
guarantees. In this paper, we identify the dimensions and key issues of
integrated resource management and our envisioned approaches to address them.

applies it to corner event detection. The proposed pipeline extract fine

motion. The ANMS runs directly on the asynchronous event stream with extremely
low latency, which hardly affects the speed of original detectors.
Additionally, we evaluate the DAVIS-based ground-truth labeling method to fill
the gap between frame and event. Evaluation on public dataset indicates that
the proposed ANMS pipeline significantly improves the performance of three
classical asynchronous detectors with negligible latency. More importantly, the
proposed ANMS framework is a natural extension of NMS, which is applicable to

works, a popular way is to use subgraph GNNs, which decompose the input graph
into a collection of subgraphs and enhance the representation of the graph by
applying GNN to individual subgraphs. Although subgraph GNNs are able to count
complicated substructures, they suffer from high computational and memory
costs. In this paper, we address a non-trivial question: can we count
substructures efficiently with GNNs? To answer the question, we first
theoretically show that the distance to the rooted nodes within subgraphs is
key to boosting the counting power of subgraph GNNs. We then encode such
information into structural embeddings, and precompute the embeddings to avoid
extracting information over all subgraphs via GNNs repeatedly. Experiments on
various benchmarks show that the proposed model can preserve the counting power
of subgraph GNNs while running orders of magnitude faster.

Wireless Edge Servers (WES) that are popular in 5G architecture and therein
URLLC, enhanced broadband features to obtain and process the brain activities,
i.e., electroencephalography (EEG) signals (via uplink wireless channels). As a
result, the WES can learn human behaviors, adapt system configurations, and
allocate radio resources to create individualized settings and enhance user
experiences. Despite the potential of BCI, the inherent noisy/fading wireless
channels and the uncertainty in Metaverse users' demands and behaviors make the
related resource allocation and learning/classification problems particularly
challenging. We formulate the joint learning and resource allocation problem as
a Quality-of-Experience (QoE) maximization problem that takes into the latency,
brain classification accuracy, and resources of the system. To tackle this
mixed integer programming problem, we then propose two novel algorithms that
are (i) a hybrid learning algorithm to maximize the user QoE and (ii) a
meta-learning algorithm to exploit the neurodiversity of the brain signals
among multiple Metaverse users. The extensive experiment results with different
BCI datasets show that our proposed algorithms can not only provide low delay

  Computing Networks",,,"10.1109/TWC.2023.3260141",,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) is a new Federated Learning (FL)
paradigm, particularly tackling the heterogeneity issues brought by various
mobile user equipments (UEs) in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. However,
due to the ever-increasing number of UEs and the complicated administrative
work it brings, it is desirable to switch the PFL algorithm from its
conventional two-layer framework to a multiple-layer one. In this paper, we
propose hierarchical PFL (HPFL), an algorithm for deploying PFL over massive
MEC networks. The UEs in HPFL are divided into multiple clusters, and the UEs
in each cluster forward their local updates to the edge server (ES)
synchronously for edge model aggregation, while the ESs forward their edge
models to the cloud server semi-asynchronously for global model aggregation.
The above training manner leads to a tradeoff between the training loss in each
round and the round latency. HPFL combines the objectives of training loss
minimization and round latency minimization while jointly determining the
optimal bandwidth allocation as well as the ES scheduling policy in the
hierarchical learning framework. Extensive experiments verify that HPFL not
only guarantees convergence in hierarchical aggregation frameworks but also has
advantages in round training loss maximization and round latency minimization.

evaluation of GPU filters to reduce the cost of computing the 2D convex hull.
The technique first performs a preprocessing of the input set, filtering all
points within an eight-vertex polygon in logarithmic time, to obtain a reduced
set of candidate points. We use parallel computation and the use of the
Manhattan distance as a metric to find the vertices of the polygon and perform
the point filtering. For the filtering stage we study different approaches;
from custom CUDA kernels to libraries such as Thrust and CUB. Three types of
point distributions are tested: a normal distribution (favorable case),
circumference (the worst case), and a case where points are shifted randomly
from the circumference (intermediate case). Experimental evaluation shows that
the GPU filtering algorithm can be up to 23x faster than a sequential CPU
implementation, and the whole convex hull computation can be up to 30x faster
than the fastest implementation provided by the CGAL library.

discovering unmet needs and developing innovative concepts as potential
solutions. From a human-centered design perspective, designers must develop
empathy with people to truly understand their needs. However, developing
empathy is a complex and subjective process that relies heavily on the
designer's empathic capability. Therefore, the development of empathic
understanding is intuitive, and the discovery of underlying needs is often
serendipitous. This paper aims to provide insights from artificial intelligence
research to indicate the future direction of AI-driven human-centered design,
taking into account the essential role of empathy. Specifically, we conduct an
interdisciplinary investigation of research areas such as data-driven user
studies, empathic understanding development, and artificial empathy. Based on
this foundation, we discuss the role that artificial empathy can play in
human-centered design and propose an artificial empathy framework for
human-centered design. Building on the mechanisms behind empathy and insights
from empathic design research, the framework aims to break down the rather
complex and subjective concept of empathy into components and modules that can
potentially be modeled computationally. Furthermore, we discuss the expected
benefits of developing such systems and identify current research gaps to
encourage future research efforts.

results show that a long-range antiferromagnetic state is established below
$T_{\rm N}=0.24$ K. In zero fields, only about half of the full entropy is
released at $T_{\rm N}$, indicating that not all the magnetic moments are
frozen below the ordering temperature, as expected from the geometrical
frustration of the triangular spin lattice. Further studies under external

AdaptGuard avoids direct use of the risky source parameters through knowledge

neither robust pretrained models nor any changes for the following model

represent 3D scenes, with which high-fidelity geometry can be reliably restored

the reference style which directly leads to high-quality zero-shot style
transfer. StyleRF consists of two innovative designs. The first is
sampling-invariant content transformation that makes the transformation
invariant to the holistic statistics of the sampled 3D points and accordingly
ensures multi-view consistency. The second is deferred style transformation of
2D feature maps which is equivalent to the transformation of 3D points but
greatly reduces memory footprint without degrading multi-view consistency.
Extensive experiments show that StyleRF achieves superior 3D stylization

ground state energy of many-body quantum problems and attracts more and more
interests due to the development of machine learning. The recent paradigms in
VMC construct neural networks as trial wave functions, sample quantum
configurations using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and train neural networks
with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. However, the theoretical
convergence of VMC is still unknown when SGD interacts with MCMC sampling given
a well-designed trial wave function. Since MCMC reduces the difficulty of
estimating gradients, it has inevitable bias in practice. Moreover, the local
energy may be unbounded, which makes it harder to analyze the error of MCMC
sampling. Therefore, we assume that the local energy is sub-exponential and use
the Bernstein inequality for non-stationary Markov chains to derive error
bounds of the MCMC estimator. Consequently, VMC is proven to have a first order
convergence rate $O(\log K/\sqrt{n K})$ with $K$ iterations and a sample size
$n$. It partially explains how MCMC influences the behavior of SGD.
Furthermore, we verify the so-called correlated negative curvature condition
and relate it to the zero-variance phenomena in solving eigenvalue functions.
It is shown that VMC escapes from saddle points and reaches
$(\epsilon,\epsilon^{1/4})$ -approximate second order stationary points or
$\epsilon^{1/2}$-variance points in at least
$O(\epsilon^{-11/2}\log^{2}(1/\epsilon) )$ steps with high probability. Our
analysis enriches the understanding of how VMC converges efficiently and can be

defined in domains of heterogeneous dimensions that are embedded into each
other. This formulation is a consequence of geometric model reduction
techniques that transform the original problems defined in complex
three-dimensional domains into more tractable ones. The definition and the
approximation of coupling operators suitable for this class of problems is
still a challenge. We develop a general mathematical framework for the analysis
and the approximation of partial differential equations coupled by non-matching
constraints across different dimensions, focusing on their enforcement using
Lagrange multipliers. In this context, we address in abstract and general terms
the well-posedness, stability, and robustness of the problem with respect to
the smallest characteristic length of the embedded domain. We also address the
numerical approximation of the problem and we discuss the inf-sup stability of
the proposed numerical scheme for some representative configuration of the
embedded domain. The main message of this work is twofold: from the standpoint
of the theory of mixed-dimensional problems, we provide general and abstract
mathematical tools to formulate coupled problems across dimensions. From the
practical standpoint of the numerical approximation, we show the interplay
between the mesh characteristic size, the dimension of the Lagrange multiplier
space, and the size of the inclusion in representative configurations
interesting for applications. The latter analysis is complemented with
illustrative numerical examples.

narrow, concentrated downdrafts called entropy rain to accommodate the Sun's
luminosity. Both observations suggest some mechanism of non-local convective
transport. We seek to predict the depth that a concentrated density anomaly can
reach before efficiently mixing with its environment in bottomless atmospheres.
We modify classic self-similar analytical models of entraining thermals to
account for the compressibility of an abyssal atmosphere. We compare these
models to the output of high resolution three dimensional fluid dynamical
simulations to more accurately model the chaotic influence of turbulence. We
find that localized density anomalies propagate down to ~3-8 times their
initial size without substantially mixing with their environment. Our analytic
model accurately predicts the initial flow, but the self-similarity assumption
breaks down after the flow becomes unstable at a characteristic penetration
depth. In the context of Jupiter, our findings suggest that precipitation
concentrated into localized downdrafts of size ~20km can coherently penetrate
to on the order of a hundred kilometers (tens of bars) beneath its initial
vaporization level without mixing with its environment. This finding is
consistent with expected convective storm length-scales, and Juno MWR
measurements of ammonia depletion. Compositional gradients of volatiles beneath
their cloud levels may be common on stormy giant planets. In the context of the
Sun, we find that turbulent downdrafts in abyssal atmospheres cannot maintain
their coherence through the Sun's convective layer, a potential challenge for
the entropy rain hypothesis.

  We study the sender's expected utility maximization using finite and infinite

quasiparticles, are central to the field of condensed matter. While the
harmonic approximation can reproduce a number of properties observed in real
crystals, the inclusion of anharmonicity in lattice dynamics is essential to
accurately predict properties such as heat transport or thermal expansion. For
highly anharmonic systems, non perturbative approaches are needed, which result
in renormalized theories of lattice dynamics. In this article, we apply the
Mori-Zwanzig projector formalism to derive an exact generalized Langevin
equation describing the quantum dynamics of nuclei in a crystal. By projecting
this equation on quasiparticles in reciprocal space, and with results from
linear response theory, we obtain a formulation of vibrational spectra that
fully accounts for the anharmonicity. Using a mode-coupling approach, we
construct a systematic perturbative expansion in which each new order is built
to minimize the following ones. With a truncation to the lowest order, we show
how to obtain a set of self-consistent equations that can describe the
lineshapes of quasiparticles. The only inputs needed for the resulting set of
equations are the static Kubo correlation functions, which can be computed
using path-integral molecular dynamics or approximated with (classical or ab
initio) molecular dynamics.

is a measure of uniformity widely used in the study of QMC, and implemented
short-period Tausworthe generators (i.e., linear feedback shift register

suffers from problems of slow convergence and lower accuracy. In this paper, we
implement PFSL, a new framework of distributed split learning where a large
number of thin clients perform transfer learning in parallel, starting with a
pre-trained DL model without sharing their data or labels with a central

provide high performance for their respective data distributions. Furthermore,
we evaluate performance fairness amongst clients under a work fairness
constraint for various scenarios of non-i.i.d. data distributions and unequal

very close to that of centralized learning on several real-life benchmarks. It
has a very low computation cost compared to FL variants and promises to deliver
the full benefits of DL to extremely thin, resource-constrained clients.

such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) has been widely studied. Whereas, the cross-plane one is
far from sufficient. Based on the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics
simulations and Boltzmann transport equation, here we reveal the stacking and
thickness effects on the cross-plane thermal conductivity (K) of h-BN. We find
that K can be significantly modulated by both the stacking structure and
thickness (d) of h-BN, which is unexpected from the viewpoint of its smooth
in-plane structure and weak interlayer interaction. In the small thickness
region (d<6 nm), K of h-BN at room temperature significantly increases with
thickness, following a power law of K ~ d^b with b=0.84, 0.66, and 0.92 for
AA', AB, and AB' stacking structures, respectively. Moreover, K of AB'
structure reaches up to 60% larger than that of AA' and AB structures with
d=5.3 nm, showing the remarkable stacking effect. We also find that the
stacking effect on K changes dramatically with d increasing, where AA' stacking
has the largest K with d > 200 nm. We finally clarify that such exotic stacking
and thickness dependence of K is owing to the competing effect of excited
number of phonons and phonon relaxation time, both of which directly affect the
thermal conductivity. Our findings may provide new insights into the

Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) with photons, neutrinos and gravitational

a correlation of the spectral lag data with redshift and energy. These have
been primarily carried out using compact objects such as pulsars, Active

claims for LIV from some of these spectral lag observations with GRBs, which
however are in conflict with the most stringent limits obtained from other LIV

astrophysical observations at MeV energies (from SN 1987A) as well as in the
TeV-PeV energy range based on IceCube observations, atmospheric neutrinos, and

a set of AU features from each facial representation; and (iii) a
spatio-temporal graph learning module that constructs a spatio-temporal graph

linear parameter-varying (LPV) representation. By applying the LPV extension of
the Fundamental Lemma in this velocity domain, a state-feedback controller is
directly synthesized to provide asymptotic stability and dissipativity of the

realized as a NL state-feedback law for the original unknown NL system with

the state of the art focuses on single output systems and mostly neglects
potential of such systems in generating multiple controlled outputs. This paper
investigates the use of the extra degrees of freedom that a reconfigurable
battery offers to generate multiple outputs for the adjustable supply of
various independent loads. The technology offers the potential for functional
integration, exploiting already existing transistors, and for a reduction of
separate dedicated power conversion stages. Interleaved output ports, where
some modules are shared among different outputs, can further reduce the
necessary power electronics and cost. However, using conventional modulation
techniques in particular phase-shifted carrier modulation can be challenging
with shared modules among multiple ports, and different control objectives can
adversely impact the overall performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a
strategy to decouple the control of multiple ports to enable further
simplification of required power electronics. The proposed system does not
require any additional active switches for the isolated port and can operate
with a wide range of output voltages. Simulation and experiments verify the

quantity, the problem is amenable to graph network. The existing graph network
methods often employ self-supervision or contrastive learning to construct
training objectives, which as such are not directly related to smoothing
embedding of spots and thus hard to perform well. Herein, we propose a graph
and image-based method (STGIC) which adopts AGC, an existing graph-based method
not depending on any trainable parameters for generating pseudo-labels for
clustering by our dilated convolution network (CNN)-based frameworks which are
fed with virtual image also transformed from spatial and transcription
information of spots. The pre-defined graph convolution kernel in AGC plays a
key role as a low-pass filter in smoothing, which can be further guaranteed by
our training loss demanding embedding similarity between neighboring pixels.
Our dilated CNN-based frameworks are featured by two parallel components
respectively with convolution kernel size of 3 and 2, besides some constraints
are made on the convolution kernel weights. These fancied designs ensure spots
information updates by aggregating only that from neighboring spots with the
weights depending on the distance from kernel center. Apart from the above
tricks, self-supervision and contrastive learning are also adopted in STGIC to
construct our training objective. Tests with the generally recognized dataset

founded approach to otherwise difficult cooperative multi-agent control.
However, the strict assumption of many independent, homogeneous agents may be
too stringent in practice. In this work, we propose a novel discrete-time
generalization of Markov decision processes and MFC to both many minor agents
and potentially complex major agents -- major-minor mean field control (M3FC).
In contrast to deterministic MFC, M3FC allows for stochastic minor agent
distributions with strong correlation between minor agents through the major
agent state, which can model arbitrary problem details not bound to any agent.
Theoretically, we give rigorous approximation properties with novel proofs for
both M3FC and existing MFC models in the finite multi-agent problem, together
with a dynamic programming principle for solving such problems. In the
infinite-horizon discounted case, existence of an optimal stationary policy
follows. Algorithmically, we propose the major-minor mean field proximal policy
optimization algorithm (M3FPPO) as a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning
algorithm and demonstrate its success in illustrative M3FC-type problems.

associated with a structural distortion at 31 K in zero magnetic field,
indicating that the spin-lattice coupling is responsible for relieving the
geometrical frustration. When applying a pulsed high magnetic field, a sharp
metamagnetic transition takes place at 40 T, followed by a 1/2-magnetization
plateau up to 103 T. These phase transitions accompany dielectric anomalies,
suggesting the presence of helical spin correlations in low-field phases. The

value iteration by updating many states simultaneously. The adoption of
GPU-accelerated approaches has been limited in operational research relative to
other fields like machine learning, in which new software frameworks have made
GPU programming widely accessible. We used the Python library JAX to implement
value iteration and simulators of the underlying Markov decision processes in a
high-level API, and relied on this library's function transformations and
compiler to efficiently utilize GPU hardware. Our method can extend use of
value iteration to settings that were previously considered infeasible or
impractical. We demonstrate this on example scenarios from three recent studies
which include problems with over 16 million states and additional problem
features, such as substitution between products, that increase computational
complexity. We compare the performance of the optimal replenishment policies to
heuristic policies, fitted using simulation optimization in JAX which allowed
the parallel evaluation of multiple candidate policy parameters on thousands of

surprisingly cost-effective education benefits, enabling children to achieve

technique for securing the Internet of things. It exploits the intrinsic and

In real-world communication systems, hardware impairments across transmitters
are subtle, which are difficult to model explicitly. Recently, due to the
superior performance of deep learning (DL)-based classification models on
real-world datasets, DL networks have been explored for RFF. Most existing
DL-based RFF models use a single representation of radio signals as the input.
Multi-channel input model can leverage information from different

features extracted from multiple representations of radio signals, including IQ
samples, carrier frequency offset, fast Fourier transform coefficients and
short-time Fourier transform coefficients, for better RF fingerprint
identification. The features extracted from different channels are fused
adaptively using a shared attention module, where the weights of neural
features from multiple channels are learned during training the McAFF model. In
addition, we design a signal identification module using a convolution-based
ResNeXt block to map the fused features to device identities. To evaluate the

interactive image segmentation with a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve
it with reinforcement learning (RL) where each voxel is treated as an agent.
Considering the large exploration space for voxel-wise prediction and the
dependence among neighboring voxels for the segmentation tasks, multi-agent
reinforcement learning is adopted, where the voxel-level policy is shared among
agents. Considering that boundary voxels are more important for segmentation,
we further introduce a boundary-aware reward, which consists of a global reward
in the form of relative cross-entropy gain, to update the policy in a
constrained direction, and a boundary reward in the form of relative weight, to
emphasize the correctness of boundary predictions. To combine the advantages of
different types of interactions, i.e., simple and efficient for point-clicking,
and stable and robust for scribbles, we propose a supervoxel-clicking based
interaction design. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets have shown
that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts, with
the advantage of fewer interactions, higher accuracy, and enhanced robustness.

Assuming a galaxy catalog complete up to $z=1$ and dark sirens detected with a

been devoted to scenarios where the communication between the agents may be
imperfect. To this end, this paper presents three different algorithms of
Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) in the presence of imperfect information
sharing modeled as noisy communication channels. The first algorithm, Federated
Noisy Decentralized Learning (FedNDL1), comes from the literature, where the
noise is added to their parameters to simulate the scenario of the presence of
noisy communication channels. This algorithm shares parameters to form a
consensus with the clients based on a communication graph topology through a
noisy communication channel. The proposed second algorithm (FedNDL2) is similar
to the first algorithm but with added noise to the parameters, and it performs
the gossip averaging before the gradient optimization. The proposed third

  (FedNDL3), on the other hand, shares the gradients through noisy
communication channels instead of the parameters. Theoretical and experimental
results demonstrate that under imperfect information sharing, the third scheme
that mixes gradients is more robust in the presence of a noisy channel compared

properties like the kinetic and internal energy per particle and structural
properties like the radial distribution function, and produced some snapshots
of the paths to study their shapes. Here we revisit such a study giving some
more theoretical details explaining the paths shape anisotropic conformation

  Acquisition and Transfer","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.11965",,,,"cs.HC cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Metacognitive skills have been commonly associated with preparation for
future learning in deductive domains. Many researchers have regarded strategy-
and time-awareness as two metacognitive skills that address how and when to use
a problem-solving strategy, respectively. It was shown that students who are
both strategy-and time-aware (StrTime) outperformed their nonStrTime peers
across deductive domains. In this work, students were trained on a logic tutor
that supports a default forward-chaining (FC) and a backward-chaining (BC)
strategy. We investigated the impact of mixing BC with FC on teaching strategy-
and time-awareness for nonStrTime students. During the logic instruction, the
experimental students (Exp) were provided with two BC worked examples and some
problems in BC to practice how and when to use BC. Meanwhile, their control
(Ctrl) and StrTime peers received no such intervention. Six weeks later, all
students went through a probability tutor that only supports BC to evaluate
whether the acquired metacognitive skills are transferred from logic. Our
results show that on both tutors, Exp outperformed Ctrl and caught up with
StrTime.

such as religion. The same religious groups are often provoked against each
other. Previous studies show the role of provocation in increasing tensions
between India's two prominent religious groups: Hindus and Muslims. With the
advent of the Internet, such provocation also surfaced on social media
platforms such as WhatsApp.
  By leveraging an existing dataset of Indian WhatsApp posts, we identified
three categories of provoking sentences against Indian Muslims. Further, we
labeled 7,000 sentences for three provocation categories and called this
dataset PACO. We leveraged PACO to train a model that can identify provoking
sentences from a WhatsApp post. Our best model is fine-tuned RoBERTa and
achieved a 0.851 average AUC score over five-fold cross-validation.
Automatically identifying provoking sentences could stop provoking text from
reaching out to the masses, and can prevent possible discrimination or violence
against the target religious group.
  Further, we studied the provocative speech through a pragmatic lens, by
identifying the dialog acts and impoliteness super-strategies used against the
religious group.

automatic Requirement Formalisation (RF) in the Requirement Engineering (RE)
field. The potential advantages by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP)

requirement written in natural languages is reported in different studies. The
goal of this paper is to survey and classify existing work on NLP and ML for
RF, identifying challenges in this domain and providing promising future
research directions. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature
review to outline the current state-of-the-art of NLP and ML techniques in RF
by selecting 257 papers from common used libraries. The search result is
filtered by defining inclusion and exclusion criteria and 47 relevant studies
between 2012 and 2022 are selected. We found that heuristic NLP approaches are
the most common NLP techniques used for automatic RF, primary operating on
structured and semi-structured data. This study also revealed that Deep
Learning (DL) technique are not widely used, instead classical ML techniques
are predominant in the surveyed studies. More importantly, we identified the
difficulty of comparing the performance of different approaches due to the lack
of standard benchmark cases for RF.

method of interpolating changes to a regular grid. Even when the grid spacing
is optimized for the particular parameters (not often possible in practice),
the fast tickwise estimator has generally smaller estimation errors, often by a
large factor. These results are directly applicable to tick-by-tick price data
of financial assets.

microscale volume for long periods of time, strongly enhancing light-matter
interactions, and making it a crucial platform in optical science and
applications. Current research on microcavity coupling system relays on precise
mechanical coupling with microscope monitoring, and its resonance properties
are extremely sensitive to external interference, which greatly limits the
practical application of microcavities. Therefore, a novel packaged
fiber-microcavity device with air/water tightness and stable temperature
characteristics is proposed in this paper. A variety of fixatives with
different Young's modulus gradients and low coefficients of thermal expansion
are used to design a package structure with overall vibration isolation and
buffering effect, in order to ensure the stability of the transmission spectrum
and improve the robustness of the microcavity module. Through the performance
characterization test of the device, it is proved that the packaged
microcavities can maintain a quality factor as high as 10^9, and has the
advantages of compact size, strong robustness, and versatility. This research
work is of great significance to promote the large-scale application of WGMs in
high-speed optical communication, nonlinear optics, narrow linewidth lasers,
and ultra-high sensitivity sensing.

  Reconstruction Based on Power Spectral Estimation and Uncertainty Region","14 figures, 11 pages",,,,"cs.NI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, a simple and effective robust adaptive beamforming technique is
proposed for uniform linear arrays, which is based on the power spectral
estimation and uncertainty region (PSEUR) of the interference plus noise (IPN)
components. In particular, two algorithms are presented to find the angular
sector of interference in every snapshot based on the adopted spatial
uncertainty region of the interference direction. Moreover, a power spectrum is
introduced based on the estimation of the power of interference and noise
components, which allows the development of a robust approach to IPN covariance
matrix reconstruction. The proposed method has two main advantages. First, an
angular region that contains the interference direction is updated based on the
statistics of the array data. Secondly, the proposed IPN-PSEUR method avoids
estimating the power spectrum of the whole range of possible directions of the
interference sector. Simulation results show that the performance of the
proposed IPN-PSEUR beamformer is almost always close to the optimal value
across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios.

rate, reliability, and low latency. Multi-user wireless systems can meet such
requirements by utilizing the abundant terahertz bandwidth with a massive
number of antennas, creating narrow beamforming solutions. However, existing
solutions lack proper modeling of channel dynamics, resulting in inaccurate
beamforming solutions in high-mobility scenarios. Herein, a dynamic,
semantically aware beamforming solution is proposed for the first time,
utilizing novel artificial intelligence algorithms in variational causal
inference to compute the time-varying dynamics of the causal representation of
multi-modal data and the beamforming. Simulations show that the proposed
causality-guided approach for Terahertz (THz) beamforming outperforms classical

particularly prominent in older adults, which has an insidious onset and leads
to a gradual, irreversible deterioration in cognitive domains (memory,

widespread screening and timely disease intervention. Recent advances in
pre-trained models motivate AD detection modeling to shift from low-level
features to high-level representations. This paper presents several efficient
methods to extract better AD-related cues from high-level acoustic and
linguistic features. Based on these features, the paper also proposes a novel
task-oriented approach by modeling the relationship between the participants'
description and the cognitive task. Experiments are carried out on the ADReSS
dataset in a binary classification setup, and models are evaluated on the
unseen test set. Results and comparison with recent literature demonstrate the
efficiency and superior performance of proposed acoustic, linguistic and
task-oriented methods. The findings also show the importance of semantic and
syntactic information, and feasibility of automation and generalization with
the promising audio-only and task-oriented methods for the AD detection task.

expected to have formed in low-mass ($\sim$$10^{5}-10^{9} ~ M_{\odot}$) haloes
at Cosmic Dawn ($z \sim 10 - 30$) under conditions of efficient gas cooling,
leading to gas collapse towards the centre of the halo. The halo mass cooling
threshold has been analyzed by several authors using both analytical models and
numerical simulations, with differing results. Since the halo number density is
a sensitive function of the halo mass, an accurate model of the cooling
threshold is needed for (semi-)analytical models of star formation at Cosmic
Dawn. In this paper the cooling threshold mass is calculated
(semi-)analytically, considering the effects of H$_2$-cooling and formation (in
the gas phase and on dust grains), cooling by atomic metals, Lyman-$\alpha$
cooling, photodissociation of H$_2$ by Lyman-Werner photons (including
self-shielding by H$_2$), photodetachment of H$^-$ by infrared photons,
photoevaporation by ionization fronts, and the effect of baryon streaming
velocities. We compare the calculations to several high-resolution cosmological
simulations, showing excellent agreement. We find that in regions of typical
baryon streaming velocities, star formation is possible in haloes of mass
$\gtrsim 1-2 \times 10^6 ~ M_{\odot}$ for $z \gtrsim 20$. By $z \sim 8$, the
expected Lyman-Werner background suppresses star formation in all minihaloes
below the atomic-cooling threshold ($T_{\rm vir} = 10^4 ~ \textrm{K}$). The
halo mass cooling threshold increases by another factor of $\sim$$4$ following
reionization, although this effect is slightly delayed ($z \sim 4-5$) because

dimensionality reduction techniques that use singular value decomposition (SVD)

association between documents and terms, and marginal effects; in comparison,
CA only focuses on the associations between documents and terms. Marginal
effects are usually not relevant for information retrieval, and therefore, from
a theoretical perspective CA is more suitable for information retrieval.
  In this paper, we empirically compare LSA and CA. The elements of the raw
document-term matrix are weighted, and the weighting exponent of singular
values is adjusted to improve the performance of LSA. We explore whether these
two weightings also improve the performance of CA. In addition, we compare the
optimal singular value weighting exponents for LSA and CA to identify what the
initial dimensions in LSA correspond to.
  The results for four empirical datasets show that CA always performs better
than LSA. Weighting the elements of the raw data matrix can improve CA;
however, it is data dependent and the improvement is small. Adjusting the
singular value weighting exponent usually improves the performance of CA;
however, the extent of the improved performance depends on the dataset and
number of dimensions. In general, CA needs a larger singular value weighting
exponent than LSA to obtain the optimal performance. This indicates that CA
emphasizes initial dimensions more than LSA, and thus, margins play an
important role in the initial dimensions in LSA.

specialized hardware accelerators and chips. In the nano-era, devices have
become increasingly more susceptible to permanent and transient faults.
Therefore, we need an efficient methodology for analyzing the resilience of
advanced DL systems against such faults, and understand how the faults in
neural accelerator chips manifest as errors at the DL application level, where
faults can lead to undetectable and unrecoverable errors. Using fault
injection, we can perform resilience investigations of the DL system by
modifying neuron weights and outputs at the software-level, as if the hardware
had been affected by a transient fault. Existing fault models reduce the search
space, allowing faster analysis, but requiring a-priori knowledge on the model,
and not allowing further analysis of the filtered-out search space. Therefore,
we propose ISimDL, a novel methodology that employs neuron sensitivity to
generate importance sampling-based fault-scenarios. Without any a-priori
knowledge of the model-under-test, ISimDL provides an equivalent reduction of
the search space as existing works, while allowing long simulations to cover
all the possible faults, improving on existing model requirements. Our
experiments show that the importance sampling provides up to 15x higher
precision in selecting critical faults than the random uniform sampling,
reaching such precision in less than 100 faults. Additionally, we showcase
another practical use-case for importance sampling for reliable DNN design,
namely Fault Aware Training (FAT). By using ISimDL to select the faults leading
to errors, we can insert the faults during the DNN training process to harden
the DNN against such faults. Using importance sampling in FAT reduces the
overhead required for finding faults that lead to a predetermined drop in
accuracy by more than 12x.

length values of the marked length spectrum in increasing order.
  In this paper, we describe algorithms for computing the (un)marked length
spectra of graphs embedded on the torus. More specifically, we preprocess a
weighted graph of complexity $n$ in time $O(n^2 \log \log n)$ so that, given a
cycle with $\ell$ edges representing a free homotopy class, the length of a
shortest homotopic cycle can be computed in $O(\ell+\log n)$ time. Moreover,
given any positive integer $k$, the first $k$ values of its unmarked length
spectrum can be computed in time $O(k \log n)$.
  Our algorithms are based on a correspondence between weighted graphs on the
torus and polyhedral norms. In particular, we give a weight independent bound
on the complexity of the unit ball of such norms. As an immediate consequence
we can decide if two embedded weighted graphs have the same marked spectrum in
polynomial time. We also consider the problem of comparing the unmarked spectra
and provide a polynomial time algorithm in the unweighted case and a randomized
polynomial time algorithm otherwise.

Particle-in-Cell (EM-FEMPIC) methods built around unconditionally stable time

quasi-Helmholtz decomposition, these methods were both unconditionally stable
and satisfied Gauss' Laws to machine precision. However, this architecture was
developed for systems with explicit particle integrators where fields and

exist in the literature, they follow the classic rubric: collect a system of
first order differential equations (Maxwell and Newton equations) and use an
integrator to solve the combined system. These methods suffer from the same
side-effect as earlier--they are conditionally stable. Here we propose a
different approach; we pair an unconditionally stable Maxwell solver to an

for producing parsers. Parser combinators use the host language to provide
reusable components in the form of higher-order functions with parsers as
parameters. Very few parser generators support this kind of reuse through
abstraction and even fewer generate parsers that are as modular and reusable as
the parts of the grammar for which they are produced. This paper presents a
strategy for generating modular, reusable and complete top-down parsers from
syntax descriptions with parameterized nonterminals, based on the FUN-GLL
variant of the GLL algorithm.
  The strategy is discussed and demonstrated as a novel back-end for the Happy
parser generator. Happy grammars can contain `parameterized nonterminals' in
which parameters abstract over grammar symbols, granting an abstraction
mechanism to define reusable grammar operators. However, the existing Happy
back-ends do not deliver on the full potential of parameterized nonterminals as
parameterized nonterminals cannot be reused across grammars. Moreover, the
parser generation process may fail to terminate or may result in exponentially
large parsers generated in an exponential amount of time.
  The GLL back-end presented in this paper implements parameterized
nonterminals successfully by generating higher-order functions that resemble
parser combinators, inheriting all the advantages of top-down parsing. The
back-end is capable of generating parsers for the full class of context-free
grammars, generates parsers in linear time and generates parsers that find all
derivations of the input string. To our knowledge, the presented GLL back-end
makes Happy the first parser generator that combines all these features.
  This paper describes the translation procedure of the GLL back-end and
compares it to the LALR and GLR back-ends of Happy in several experiments.

achieved by ensembles of uncorrelated particles. Fundamentally, this limit
arises from the non-commuting nature of quantum mechanics, leading to the
presence of fluctuations often referred to as quantum projection noise. Quantum
metrology relies on the use of non-classical states of many-body systems in
order to enhance the precision of measurements beyond the standard quantum
limit. To do so, one can reshape the quantum projection noise -- a strategy
known as squeezing. In the context of many-body spin systems, one typically
utilizes all-to-all interactions (e.g. the one-axis twisting model) between the
constituents to generate the structured entanglement characteristic of spin
squeezing. Motivated by recent theoretical work, here we explore the prediction
that short-range interactions -- and in particular, the two-dimensional dipolar
XY model -- can also enable the realization of scalable spin squeezing. Working
with a dipolar Rydberg quantum simulator of up to 100 atoms, we demonstrate
that quench dynamics from a polarized initial state lead to spin squeezing that
improves with increasing system size up to a maximum of -3.5 dB (prior to
correcting for detection errors, or approximately -5 dB after correction).
Finally, we present two independent refinements: first, using a multistep
spin-squeezing protocol allows us to further enhance the squeezing by
approximately 1 dB, and second, leveraging Floquet engineering to realize
Heisenberg interactions, we demonstrate the ability to extend the lifetime of
the squeezed state by freezing its dynamics.

propose a game-theoretic algorithm that has
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(H^3S^2A/\varepsilon^2)$ sample complexity thus

complexity of order
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathrm{poly}(S,A,H)/\varepsilon)$. Interestingly, it

statistical advantage of regularized MDPs for exploration. Finally, we apply

research for over hundred years, but there is still no general agreement on the
value of the pre-factor, the inverse of the K\'arm\'an ``constant'' or on its
universality. The choice diagnostic tool to locate logarithmic parts of the MVP
is to look for regions where the indicator function $\Xi$ (equal to the
wall-normal coordinate $y^+$ times the mean velocity derivative $\dd U^+/\dd
y^+$) is constant. In pressure driven flows however, such as channel and pipe
flow, $\Xi$ is significantly affected by a term proportional to the wall-normal
coordinate, of order $\mathcal{O}(\Reytau^{-1})$ in the inner expansion, but
moving up across the overlap to the leading $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in the outer
expansion. Here we show, that due to this linear overlap term, $\Reytau$'s of
the order of $10^6$ and beyond are required to produce one decade of near

the common part of the inner asymptotic expansion carried to

platooning systems are expected to realize a new paradigm of cooperative
driving with higher levels of traffic safety and efficiency. Connected and
Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) need to have proper awareness of the traffic
context. However, as the quantity of interconnected entities grows, the expense
of communication will become a significant factor. As a result, the cooperative
platoon's performance will be influenced by the communication strategy. While
maintaining desired levels of performance, periodic communication can be
relaxed to more flexible aperiodic or event-triggered implementations. In this
paper, we propose a control-aware communication solution for vehicle platoons.
The method uses a fully distributed control-aware communication strategy,
attempting to decrease the usage of communication resources while still
preserving the desired closed-loop performance characteristics. We then
leverage Model-Based Communication (MBC) to improve cooperative vehicle
perception in non-ideal communication and propose a solution that combines
control-aware communication with MBC for cooperative control of vehicle
platoons. Our approach achieves a significant reduction in the average
communication rate ($47\%$) while only slightly reducing control performance
(e.g., less than $1\%$ speed deviation). Through extensive simulations, we
demonstrate the benefits of combined control-aware communication with MBC for
cooperative control of vehicle platoons.

the 1D model has discontinuities or not.
  We present the benefits of using RUBIS to deform polytropic models and more

this first demonstration of Rydberg-mediated squeezing with a neutral-atom

Additionally, we perform a synchronous frequency comparison between independent
squeezed states and observe a fractional frequency stability of $1.087(1)\times
10^{-15}$ at one-second averaging time, which is 1.94(1) dB below the standard

afforded by optical tweezer arrays to apply local phase shifts in order to
explore spin squeezing in measurements that operate beyond the relative

is blue), they can also be outdated, incorrect, or reflective of social biases
present in the training data. Thus, there is a need to control these
assumptions without requiring explicit user input or costly re-training. In
this work, we aim to edit a given implicit assumption in a pre-trained
diffusion model. Our Text-to-Image Model Editing method, TIME for short,
receives a pair of inputs: a ""source"" under-specified prompt for which the
model makes an implicit assumption (e.g., ""a pack of roses""), and a
""destination"" prompt that describes the same setting, but with a specified
desired attribute (e.g., ""a pack of blue roses""). TIME then updates the model's
cross-attention layers, as these layers assign visual meaning to textual
tokens. We edit the projection matrices in these layers such that the source
prompt is projected close to the destination prompt. Our method is highly
efficient, as it modifies a mere 2.2% of the model's parameters in under one
second. To evaluate model editing approaches, we introduce TIMED (TIME
Dataset), containing 147 source and destination prompt pairs from various
domains. Our experiments (using Stable Diffusion) show that TIME is successful
in model editing, generalizes well for related prompts unseen during editing,
and imposes minimal effect on unrelated generations.

invoked as a possible solution to the puzzles raised by the presence of
multiple stellar populations and peculiar abundance patterns observed in

developed observational strategies to search for SMS hosted within young
massive clusters (thought to be the precursors of globular clusters, GCs),
which could be applicable in a relatively general fashion, using both
photometric and spectroscopic observations. We used theoretical predictions of
spectra of SMS and SMS-hosting clusters, together with predictions from
standard simple stellar populations to examine their impact on color-color
diagrams and on individual optical spectral lines (primarily Hydrogen emission
and absorption lines). As a first step, we apply our search strategies to a
sample of $\sim 3000$ young star clusters (YSC) from two nearby galaxies with
multi-band observations from the HST and optical integral-field spectroscopy
obtained with MUSE on the Very Large Telescope. We focus on models for SMS with
large radii (corresponding to $ Teff \lesssim 7000$ K), which predict strong
Balmer breaks, and construct proper color-color diagrams to select the
corresponding SMS-hosting cluster candidates. We show that their
spectrophotometric properties are similar to that of normal clusters with ages
of a few hundred Myr, which would, however, show signs of composite stellar
populations, in particular the presence of nebular lines (H${\alpha}$ and
others). Examining the photometry, overall SEDs, and the spectra of $\sim 100$
clusters with strong Balmer breaks, we have found several objects with peculiar
SEDs, the presence of emission lines, or other peculiar signatures. [abridged]

\geq 8$ to the nearest node ($d_{\mathrm{node}}$) and the nearest filament
spine ($d_{\mathrm{fil}}$) to study the dependence of both median specific star
formation rate (<sSFR>) and median gas fraction (<$f_{\mathrm{gas}}$>) on these

environment at $z<2$, with the dependence increasing with time. At $z\leq0.5$,
$8 \leq \log(M_{\ast}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) < 9$ galaxies are quenched at
$d_{\mathrm{node}}\lesssim1$~Mpc, and have significantly-suppressed star
formation at $d_{\mathrm{fil}}\lesssim1$~Mpc, trends driven mostly by satellite
galaxies. At $z\leq1$, in contrast to the monotonic drop in <sSFR> of
$\log(M_{\ast}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) <10$ galaxies with decreasing

low-mass satellites are quenched by rapid gas stripping in dense environments
near nodes and gradual gas starvation in intermediate-density environments near
filaments, while at earlier times cosmic web structures efficiently channeled

Concrete applications are presented only for monolayers WSe$_2$ and WS$_2$ from
the recently available experimental data; however, the presented approach is
universal and can be applied to other monolayer TMDCs. The mentioned fitting

also develop such a method in this paper for highly accurate magnetoexciton

analysis of WMAP and Planck LFI time-ordered data, processed within a single
Bayesian end-to-end framework. This framework builds directly on a similar
analysis of the LFI measurements by the BeyondPlanck collaboration, and
approaches the CMB analysis challenge through Gibbs sampling of a global
posterior distribution, simultaneously accounting for calibration, mapmaking,
and component separation. The computational cost of producing one complete
WMAP+LFI Gibbs sample is 812 CPU-hr, of which 603 CPU-hrs are spent on WMAP
low-level processing; this demonstrates that end-to-end Bayesian analysis of
the WMAP data is computationally feasible. We find that our WMAP posterior mean
temperature sky maps and CMB temperature power spectrum are largely consistent
with the official WMAP9 results. Perhaps the most notable difference is that
our CMB dipole amplitude is $3366.2 \pm 1.4\ \mathrm{\mu K}$, which is $11\
\mathrm{\mu K}$ higher than the WMAP9 estimate and $2.5\ {\sigma}$ higher than
BeyondPlanck; however, it is in perfect agreement with the HFI-dominated Planck
PR4 result. In contrast, our WMAP polarization maps differ more notably from
the WMAP9 results, and in general exhibit significantly lower large-scale
residuals. We attribute this to a better constrained gain and transmission
imbalance model. It is particularly noteworthy that the W-band polarization sky
map, which was excluded from the official WMAP cosmological analysis, for the
first time appears visually consistent with the V-band sky map. Similarly, the
long standing discrepancy between the WMAP K-band and LFI 30 GHz maps is
finally resolved, and the difference between the two maps appears consistent
with instrumental noise at high Galactic latitudes. All maps and the associated
code are made publicly available through the Cosmoglobe web page.

preferences for traits (individual characteristics such as age, sex, etc.). We
first show that the model can generate diverse artificial social structures,

use the model to gain fundamental insights into how two main categories of

with the types of trait they are used with, can have important consequences for
the spread of information and disease, and the robustness of social structures
against fragmentation. The results also suggest that symmetric degree

generally, the study implies that trait-based social preferences can have
consequences for social systems that go far beyond their effect on direct

regulariser enforces the deformation field to be smooth, invertible and
orientation-preserving. More importantly, we strictly guarantee topology
preservation yielding to a clinical meaningful registration. Secondly, we boost
the performance of our regulariser through coordinate MLPs, where one can view
the to-be-registered images as continuously differentiable entities. We

  Simulating Training Runs",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Training data attribution (TDA) methods offer to trace a model's prediction
on any given example back to specific influential training examples. Existing
approaches do so by assigning a scalar influence score to each training
example, under a simplifying assumption that influence is additive. But in
reality, we observe that training examples interact in highly non-additive ways
due to factors such as inter-example redundancy, training order, and curriculum
learning effects.
  To study such interactions, we propose Simfluence, a new paradigm for TDA
where the goal is not to produce a single influence score per example, but
instead a training run simulator: the user asks, ``If my model had trained on
example $z_1$, then $z_2$, ..., then $z_n$, how would it behave on
$z_{test}$?''; the simulator should then output a simulated training run, which
is a time series predicting the loss on $z_{test}$ at every step of the
simulated run. This enables users to answer counterfactual questions about what
their model would have learned under different training curricula, and to
directly see where in training that learning would occur.
  We present a simulator, Simfluence-Linear, that captures non-additive
interactions and is often able to predict the spiky trajectory of individual
example losses with surprising fidelity. Furthermore, we show that existing TDA
methods such as TracIn and influence functions can be viewed as special cases
of Simfluence-Linear. This enables us to directly compare methods in terms of
their simulation accuracy, subsuming several prior TDA approaches to
evaluation. In experiments on large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, we show
that our method predicts loss trajectories with much higher accuracy than
existing TDA methods (doubling Spearman's correlation and reducing mean-squared
error by 75%) across several tasks, models, and training methods.

e.g. dependency and constituency parse trees, in their embeddings while being

some computation weakly correlated with it. We study questions: (a) Is it
possible to explicitly describe transformers with realistic embedding
dimension, number of heads, etc. that are capable of doing parsing -- or even
approximate parsing? (b) Why do pre-trained models capture parsing structure?
This paper takes a step toward answering these questions in the context of
generative modeling with PCFGs. We show that masked language models like BERT
or RoBERTa of moderate sizes can approximately execute the Inside-Outside
algorithm for the English PCFG [Marcus et al, 1993]. We also show that the
Inside-Outside algorithm is optimal for masked language modeling loss on the
PCFG-generated data. We also give a construction of transformers with $50$
layers, $15$ attention heads, and $1275$ dimensional embeddings in average such
that using its embeddings it is possible to do constituency parsing with
$>70\%$ F1 score on PTB dataset. We conduct probing experiments on models
pre-trained on PCFG-generated data to show that this not only allows recovery
of approximate parse tree, but also recovers marginal span probabilities
computed by the Inside-Outside algorithm, which suggests an implicit bias of

significantly outperforms all-demo ICL adopted by most previous works,

develop new methods to use large-scale structure (LSS) tracers to remove cosmic

kSZ signals vanish on small scales, thus leaving the CMB blackbody power
spectrum unbiased after cleaning. We develop methods analogous to delensing
($\textit{de-CIB}$ or $\textit{de-(CIB+tSZ)}$) to clean CIB and tSZ
contaminants using these tracers. We compare these methods to internal linear
combination (ILC) methods, including novel approaches that incorporate the
tracer maps in the ILC procedure itself, without requiring exact assumptions
about the CIB SED. As a concrete example, we use the $\textit{unWISE}$ galaxy

improvements with our methods over current approaches are already
non-negligible: we find improvements up to 20% in the kSZ power spectrum
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when applying the de-CIB method to a
tSZ-deprojected ILC map. These gains could be more significant when using
additional LSS tracers from current surveys, and will become even larger with
future LSS surveys, with improvements in the kSZ power spectrum SNR up to 50%.
For the total CMB blackbody power spectrum, these improvements stand at 4% and

datasets. To bridge the gap of vocabulary and annotation granularity, we first
introduce a pre-trained text encoder to encode all the visual concepts in two
tasks and learn a common semantic space for them. This gives us reasonably good
results compared with the counterparts trained on segmentation task only. To
further reconcile them, we locate two discrepancies: $i$) task discrepancy --
segmentation requires extracting masks for both foreground objects and
background stuff, while detection merely cares about the former; $ii$) data
discrepancy -- box and mask annotations are with different spatial granularity,
and thus not directly interchangeable. To address these issues, we propose a
decoupled decoding to reduce the interference between foreground/background and
a conditioned mask decoding to assist in generating masks for given boxes. To
this end, we develop a simple encoder-decoder model encompassing all three

model exhibits competitive or stronger zero-shot transferability for both

these disturbances. A common solution is to use optical flow to provide motion
information, but essentially it only considers pixel-level motion, which still
relies on appearance similarity and hence is often inaccurate under occlusion
and fast movement. In this work, we study the instance-level motion and present
InstMove, which stands for Instance Motion for Object-centric Video
Segmentation. In comparison to pixel-wise motion, InstMove mainly relies on
instance-level motion information that is free from image feature embeddings,
and features physical interpretations, making it more accurate and robust
toward occlusion and fast-moving objects. To better fit in with the video
segmentation tasks, InstMove uses instance masks to model the physical presence
of an object and learns the dynamic model through a memory network to predict
its position and shape in the next frame. With only a few lines of code,
InstMove can be integrated into current SOTA methods for three different video
segmentation tasks and boost their performance. Specifically, we improve the
previous arts by 1.5 AP on OVIS dataset, which features heavy occlusions, and
4.9 AP on YouTubeVIS-Long dataset, which mainly contains fast-moving objects.
These results suggest that instance-level motion is robust and accurate, and
hence serving as a powerful solution in complex scenarios for object-centric
video segmentation.

derive their topological response theory and boundary anomaly -- applicable to
superconductors treated with dynamical electromagnetic field. This generalizes
the discussion of discrete gauge theories by Verresen et al., arXiv:2211.01376.
We show that a Higgs phase in $d$ spatial dimensions is in a non-trivial SPT
class protected by a global $U(1)$ symmetry associated with the Higgs field,
and a $d-2$ form $U(1)$ magnetic symmetry, associated with the absence of
magnetic monopoles. In $d=2$, this gives an SPT with a mixed Hall response
between conventional symmetries, whereas in $d=3$ we obtain a novel SPT
protected by a 0-form and 1-form symmetry whose 2+1d boundary anomaly is
satisfied by a superfluid. The signature properties of superconductors -- Higgs
phases for electromagnetism -- can be reproduced from this SPT response. For
instance, the Josephson effect directly arises from the aforementioned boundary
superfluid. In addition to this minimalist approach being complementary to
Landau-Ginzburg theory, its non-perturbative nature is useful in situations
where fluctuations are significant. We substantiate this by predicting the
stability of the Josephson effect upon introducing monopoles in $U(1)$ lattice
gauge theory, where tuning from the charge-1 Higgs phase to the confined phase
leads to a quantum critical point in the junction. Furthermore, this
perspective reveals unexpected connections, such as how persistent currents at
the surface of a superconductor arise from generalized Thouless pumps. We also
treat generalizations to partial-Higgs phases, including ""2e"" condensates in

propose a dataset Diversity-Aware prompting strategy whose initialization is
realized by a Meta-prompt. Specifically, we cluster the downstream dataset into
small homogeneity subsets in a diversity-adaptive way, with each subset has its

(mass-metallicity relation, MZR) in galaxies is often ascribed to the higher
capability of more massive systems to retain metals against the action of
galactic outflows. In this scenario the stellar mass would simply be an
indirect proxy of the dynamical mass or of the gravitational potential. We test
this scenario by using a sample of more than one thousand star-forming galaxies
from the MaNGA survey for which dynamical masses have been accurately
determined. By using three different methods (average dispersion, Partial

metallicity depends primarily and fundamentally on the stellar mass. Once the
dependence on stellar mass is taken into account, there is little or no
dependence on either dynamical mass or gravitational potential (and, if

result indicates that the MZR is not caused by the retention of metals in more
massive galaxies. The direct, fundamental dependence of metallicity on stellar
mass suggests the much simpler scenario in which the MZR is just a consequence

order $D\sim 10^{31\text{--}32}\text{ cm}^2\text{ s}^{-1}$, inferred
independently from relic energies, the spatial variability of giant-halo
spectra, and the spectral evolution of relics, reproduces the observed
spatio-spectral distributions, explains the recently discovered mega-halos as
enhanced peripheral magnetisation, and quenches electron (re)acceleration by
weak shocks or turbulence. For instance, the hard-to-soft evolution along
secondary-electron diffusion explains both the soft spectra in most halo
peripheries and relic downstreams, and the hard spectra in most halo centres
and relic edges, where the photon index can reach $\alpha\simeq -0.5$
regardless of the Mach number $\mathcal{M}$ of the coincident shock. Such
spatio-spectral modeling, recent $\gamma$-ray observations, and additional
accumulated evidence are thus shown to support a previous claim (Keshet 2010)
that the seamless transitions among minihalos, giant halos, and relics, their
similar energetics, integrated spectra, and delineating discontinuities, the
inconsistent $\mathcal{M}$ inferred from radio vs. X-rays in leptonic models,

are manifestations of the same cosmic-ray ion population, with no need to

sufficiently strong magnetic fields, instead becoming evanescent. When
encountering strong magnetic fields, ingoing gravity waves are likely refracted
into outgoing slow magnetic waves. These outgoing waves approach infinite

be possible for a small fraction of the wave power to escape the stellar core

appear in LISA band for 2-5 years. We thus explore symmetric (exponential,
Pad\'e or Hermite) integrators, which are unconditionally stable and known to
preserve certain Noether symmetries and phase-space volume. For linear
hyperbolic equations, these implicit integrators can be cast in explicit form,
making them well-suited for long-time evolution of black hole perturbations.
The 1+1 modal Teukolsky equation is discretized in space using polynomial
collocation methods and reduced to a linear system of ordinary differential
equations, coupled via mode-coupling arrays and discretized (matrix)
differential operators. We use a matricization technique to cast the
mode-coupled system in a form amenable to a method-of-lines framework, which
simplifies numerical implementation and enables efficient parallelization on
CPU and GPU architectures. We test our numerical code by studying late-time

coexistence of all three species, thus failing to provide a biologically
realistic outcome. To improve this, we introduce free space as a relevant

that the consideration of free space stabilizes the dynamics by means of cyclic
dominance that emerges between the three species. We determine the parameter

means of analytical derivations as well as by means of numerical simulations.
We conclude that the consideration of free space as a finite resource reveals

magnitudes to changes in DER reactive power setpoints; such sensitivities are
learned online via a recursive least squares estimator (rLSE). To ensure proper

developing a convolutional neural network to detect and classify nematic

implementable on experimental images of cell layers and is specifically
designed to be suitable for cells that are not rod-shaped. We demonstrate that
our machine learning model outperforms current defect detection techniques and
that this manifests itself in our method requiring less data to accurately

on the hereditary discrepancy of a set system. In their paper, Lovasz, Spencer,

by a function of the hereditary discrepancy. This was answered in the negative
by Hoffman, and the largest known multiplicative gap between the two quantities
for a set system of $m$ substes of a universe of size $n$ is on the order of
$\max\{\log n, \sqrt{\log m}\}$. On the other hand, building on work of
Matou\v{s}ek [Proceedings of the AMS, 2013], recently Jiang and Reis [SOSA,

$\sqrt{\log(m)\log(n)}$. This is tight when $m$ is polynomial in $n$, but
leaves open what happens for large $m$. We show that the bound of Jiang and

providing quantum-mechanical accuracy but orders-of-magnitude faster,
illustrated by ACM Gordon Bell prize (2020) and finalist (2021).
State-of-the-art (SOTA) NNQMD model founded on group theory featuring
rotational equivariance and local descriptors has provided much higher accuracy
and speed than those models, thus named Allegro (meaning fast). On massively
parallel supercomputers, however, it suffers a fidelity-scaling problem, where
growing number of unphysical predictions of interatomic forces prohibits
simulations involving larger numbers of atoms for longer times. Here, we solve
this problem by combining the Allegro model with sharpness aware minimization
(SAM) for enhancing the robustness of model through improved smoothness of the
loss landscape. The resulting Allegro-Legato (meaning fast and ""smooth"") model
was shown to elongate the time-to-failure $t_\textrm{failure}$, without
sacrificing computational speed or accuracy. Specifically, Allegro-Legato
exhibits much weaker dependence of timei-to-failure on the problem size,
$t_{\textrm{failure}} \propto N^{-0.14}$ ($N$ is the number of atoms) compared
to the SOTA Allegro model $\left(t_{\textrm{failure}} \propto
N^{-0.29}\right)$, i.e., systematically delayed time-to-failure, thus allowing
much larger and longer NNQMD simulations without failure. The model also
exhibits excellent computational scalability and GPU acceleration on the
Polaris supercomputer at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. Such scalable,
accurate, fast and robust NNQMD models will likely find broad applications in
NNQMD simulations on emerging exaflop/s computers, with a specific example of
accounting for nuclear quantum effects in the dynamics of ammonia.

close to the radius valley are benchmark systems, which help to elucidate which

characterization of one such system, TOI-2096, composed of a super-Earth and a
mini-Neptune hosted by a mid-type M dwarf located 48 pc away. We first
characterized the host star by combining different methods. Then, we derived
the planetary properties by modeling the photometric data from TESS and
ground-based facilities. We used archival data, high-resolution imaging, and
statistical validation to support our planetary interpretation. We found that
TOI-2096 corresponds to a dwarf star of spectral type M4. It harbors a
super-Earth (R$\sim1.2 R_{\oplus}$) and a mini-Neptune (R$\sim1.90 R_{\oplus}$)
in likely slightly eccentric orbits with orbital periods of 3.12 d and 6.39 d,
respectively. These orbital periods are close to the first-order 2:1
mean-motion resonance (MMR), which may lead to measurable transit timing
variations (TTVs). We computed the expected TTVs amplitude for each planet and
found that they might be measurable with high-precision photometry delivering
mid-transit times with accuracies of $\lesssim$2 min. Moreover, measuring the
planetary masses via radial velocities (RVs) is also possible. Lastly, we found
that these planets are among the best in their class to conduct atmospheric
studies using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The properties of this
system make it a suitable candidate for further studies, particularly for mass
determination using RVs and/or TTVs, decreasing the scarcity of systems that
can be used to test planetary formation models around low-mass stars.

appears in a new moir\'e system by stacking two dissimilar van der Waals layers
with large lattice mismatch, resulting in couplings between moir\'e bands from
remote valleys in the momentum space. In this system, the first layer is
reconstructed using a $\sqrt{3}$ by $\sqrt{3}$ supercell that resembles the
Kekul\'e distortion in graphene, and such reconstruction becomes nearly
commensurate with the second layer. This Kekul\'e moir\'e superlattice is
realized in heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides and metal
phosphorus trichalcogenides such as MoTe$_2$/MnPSe$_3$. By first-principles
calculations, we demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic MnPSe$_3$ strongly
couples the otherwise degenerate Kramers' valleys of MoTe$_2$, resulting in
valley pseudospin textures that depend on N\'eel vector direction, stacking

the emission line flux ratios of different molecules at each J transition are
derived. We conduct RADEX non-LTE model calculations and find that, under a
wide range of gas density and kinetic temperature, the observed
HCN-to-HCO$^{+}$ flux ratios in the overall (U)LIRGs are naturally reproduced
with enhanced HCN abundance compared to HCO$^{+}$. Thereafter, molecular gas
properties are constrained primarily through the use of HCN and HCO$^{+}$ data
and the adoption of fiducial values for the HCO$^{+}$ column density and
HCN-to-HCO$^{+}$ abundance ratio. We quantitatively confirm the following: (1)
Molecular gas at the (U)LIRGs' nuclei is dense ($\gtrsim$10$^{3-4}$ cm$^{-3}$)
and warm ($\gtrsim$100 K). (2) Molecular gas density and temperature in nine
ULIRGs' nuclei are significantly higher than that of one LIRG's nucleus. (3)
Molecular gas in starburst-dominated sources tends to be less dense and cooler
than ULIRGs with luminous AGN signatures. For six selected sources, we also
apply a Bayesian approach by freeing all parameters and support the above main

community has gathered interest in leveraging these methods for inference,
planning, and control. Unfortunately, despite providing a closed-form inference
solution, GPs are non-parametric models that typically scale cubically with the
dataset size, hence making them difficult to be used especially on onboard
Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constrained aerial robots. In addition, the
integration of popular libraries with GPs for different kernels is not trivial.
In this paper, we propose GaPT, a novel toolkit that converts GPs to their
state space form and performs regression in linear time. GaPT is designed to be
highly compatible with several optimizers popular in robotics. We thoroughly
validate the proposed approach for learning quadrotor dynamics on both single
and multiple input GP settings. GaPT accurately captures the system behavior in
multiple flight regimes and operating conditions, including those producing
highly nonlinear effects such as aerodynamic forces and rotor interactions.
Moreover, the results demonstrate the superior computational performance of
GaPT compared to a classical GP inference approach on both single and

determined. These IEs are referenced to the local vacuum level, which is the
appropriate quantity for condensed matter with associated surfaces, including
liquids. Here, we connect this newly accessible energy level to another
important surface property, namely, the solution work function, e$\Phi_{liq}$.
We lay out the prerequisites for and unique challenges of determining e$\Phi$

aqueous solution with a tetra-n-butylammonium iodide (TBAI) surfactant solute -
that concentration-dependent work functions, associated with the surface
dipoles generated by the segregated interfacial layer of TBA$^+$ and I$^-$ions,
can be accurately measured under controlled conditions. We detail the nature of
surface potentials, uniquely tied to the nature of the flowing-liquid sample,

us to refer measured spectra of aqueous solutions to the Fermi level and
quantitatively assign surfactant concentration-dependent spectral shifts to
competing work function and electronic-structure effects, the latter
determining, e.g., (electro)chemical reactivity. We describe the extension of
liquid-jet PES to quantitatively access concentration-dependent surface

show an energetic preference for h-BN encapsulation below a single layer of
graphene: G/h-BN/SiC in bilayer systems and G/h-BN/G/SiC in trilayer systems.
Electronic structure calculations reveal that the linear energy band dispersion
of graphene is maintained in bilayer systems but with Dirac points at different
energy positions due to the varied electron doping level of graphene. In
trilayer systems, the doping level of graphene also depends on the stacking
order. The electronic band structure of G/h-BN/G/SiC features two Dirac points
below the Fermi level but with different energies. Less stable systems like
G/G/h-BN/ and h-BN/G/G/SiC display parabolic bands near the Fermi level.

ISN helium atoms is broad and overlaps the four lowest IBEX-Lo electrostatic

laboratory calibration is incomplete because it is difficult to produce
narrow-energy neutral atom beams that are expected for ISN helium atoms. Here,
we analyze the ISN helium observations in ESA steps 1-4 to derive the relative
in-flight response of IBEX-Lo to helium atoms. We compare the ratios of the
observed count rates as a function of the mean ISN helium atom energy estimated
using the Warsaw Test Particle Model (WTPM). The WTPM uses a global heliosphere
model to calculate charge exchange gains and losses to estimate the secondary
ISN helium population. We find that the modeled mean energies of ISN helium

association of magnetism and structural symmetry breaking with the appearance
in (i) and (ii) and disappearance in (iii) of insulating band gaps. It is
demonstrated here that first-principles mean-field-like density functional
theory (DFT), driven by molecular dynamics temperature evolution, can describe
not only the origin of the magnetically long-range ordered insulating phase
(i), but also the creation of an insulating paramagnet (ii) that lacks
spin-long-range order, and of a metallic paramagnet (iii) as temperature rises.
This approach provides the patterns of structural and magnetic symmetry
breaking at different temperatures, in parallel with band gaps obtained when
the evolving geometries are used as input to DFT electronic band structure
calculations. This disentangles the complex interplay among spin, charge and
orbital degrees of freedom. Analysis shows that the success in describing the
rise and fall of the insulating band gaps along the phase transition sequence
is enabled by allowing sufficient flexibility in describing diverse local
structural and magnetic motifs as input to DFT. This entails using sufficiently
large supercells that allow expressing structural disproportionation of
octahedra, as well as a description of PM phases as a distribution of local
magnetic moments. It appears that the historic dismissal of mean-field-like DFT
as being unable to describe such Mott-like transitions was premature, as it was
based on consideration of averaged crystallographic unit cells, a description
that washes out local symmetry-breaking motifs.

enables robots to obtain symbolic knowledge from the perceptual information

knowledge is still an open problem. To address this issue, this paper presents
SAILOR, a framework for providing symbolic anchoring in ROS 2 ecosystem. SAILOR
aims to maintain the link between symbolic data and perceptual data in real
robots over time. It provides a semantic world modeling approach using two deep
learning-based sub-symbolic robotic skills: object recognition and matching
function. The object recognition skill allows the robot to recognize and
identify objects in its environment, while the matching function enables the
robot to decide if new perceptual data corresponds to existing symbolic data.

problem setting allows a model to accrue knowledge from past tasks to learn new
tasks more efficiently. However, recent studies suggest that the key metric
that continual learning algorithms optimize, reduction in catastrophic
forgetting, does not correlate well with the forward transfer of knowledge. We
believe that the conclusion previous works reached is due to the way they
measure forward transfer. We argue that the measure of forward transfer to a
task should not be affected by the restrictions placed on the continual learner
in order to preserve knowledge of previous tasks. Instead, forward transfer
should be measured by how easy it is to learn a new task given a set of
representations produced by continual learning on previous tasks. Under this
notion of forward transfer, we evaluate different continual learning algorithms
on a variety of image classification benchmarks. Our results indicate that less
forgetful representations lead to a better forward transfer suggesting a strong
correlation between retaining past information and learning efficiency on new
tasks. Further, we found less forgetful representations to be more diverse and
discriminative compared to their forgetful counterparts.

One function of wearable health devices is stress detection, which relies on
sensor inputs to determine the mental state of patients. This continuous,
real-time monitoring can provide healthcare professionals with vital
physiological data and enhance the quality of patient care. Current methods of
stress detection lack: (i) robustness -- wearable health sensors contain high
levels of measurement noise that degrades performance, and (ii) adaptation --
static architectures fail to adapt to changing contexts in sensing conditions.
We propose to address these deficiencies with SELF-CARE, a generalized
selective sensor fusion method of stress detection that employs novel
techniques of context identification and ensemble machine learning. SELF-CARE
uses a learning-based classifier to process sensor features and model the
environmental variations in sensing conditions known as the noise context.
SELF-CARE uses noise context to selectively fuse different sensor combinations
across an ensemble of models to perform robust stress classification. Our
findings suggest that for wrist-worn devices, sensors that measure motion are
most suitable to understand noise context, while for chest-worn devices, the
most suitable sensors are those that detect muscle contraction. SELF-CARE
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the WESAD dataset. Using
wrist-based sensors, SELF-CARE achieves 86.34% and 94.12% accuracy for the
3-class and 2-class stress classification problems, respectively. For
chest-based wearable sensors, SELF-CARE achieves 86.19% (3-class) and 93.68%
(2-class) classification accuracy. This work demonstrates the benefits of
utilizing selective, context-aware sensor fusion in mobile health sensing that
can be applied broadly to Internet of Things applications.

goals. First, using causal diagrams, we illustrate that spatial confounding and
interference can manifest as each other, meaning that investigating the
presence of one can lead to wrongful conclusions in the presence of the other,
and that statistical dependencies in the exposure variable can render standard
analyses invalid. This can have crucial implications for analyzing data with
spatial or other dependencies, and for understanding the effect of
interventions on dependent units. Secondly, we propose a parametric approach to
mitigate bias from local and neighborhood unmeasured spatial confounding and
account for interference simultaneously. This approach is based on simultaneous
modeling of the exposure and the outcome while accounting for the presence of
spatially-structured unmeasured predictors of both variables. We illustrate our
approach with a simulation study and with an analysis of the local and

proposed method achieved an ROC-AUC=0.857 on 370 scans from 7 unseen sites in

safety-critical applications is expanding, emerging DNNs experience massive
growth in terms of computation power. It raises the necessity of improving the
reliability of DNN accelerators yet reducing the computational burden on the
hardware platforms, i.e. reducing the energy consumption and execution time as
well as increasing the efficiency of DNN accelerators. Therefore, the trade-off
between hardware performance, i.e. area, power and delay, and the reliability
of the DNN accelerator implementation becomes critical and requires tools for
analysis. In this paper, we propose a framework DeepAxe for design space
exploration for FPGA-based implementation of DNNs by considering the trilateral
impact of applying functional approximation on accuracy, reliability and
hardware performance. The framework enables selective approximation of
reliability-critical DNNs, providing a set of Pareto-optimal DNN implementation
design space points for the target resource utilization requirements. The
design flow starts with a pre-trained network in Keras, uses an innovative
high-level synthesis environment DeepHLS and results in a set of Pareto-optimal
design space points as a guide for the designer. The framework is demonstrated
in a case study of custom and state-of-the-art DNNs and datasets.

reliant on the configuration of sensors. In this work, we consider the problem
of sensor selection for PCCPs and propose a computationally efficient method to
determine an appropriate number of sensors and the corresponding placement of
the sensors. The objective is to find the (near-)optimal set of sensors that
provides the maximum degree of observability for state estimation while
satisfying the budget constraint. Specifically, we resort to the information
contained in the sensitivity matrix calculated around the operating region of a
PCCP to quantify the degree of observability of the entire system corresponding
to the placed sensors. The sensor selection problem is converted to an
optimization problem, and is efficiently solved by a one-by-one removal
approach through sensitivity analysis. Next, we extend our approach to study
fault tolerance (resilience) of the selected sensors to sensor malfunction. The
resilient sensor selection problem is to find a sensor network that gives good
estimation performance even when some of the sensors fail, thereby improving
the overall system robustness. The resilient sensor selection problem is
formulated as a max-min optimization problem. We show how the proposed approach
can be adapted to solve the sensor selection max-min optimization problem. By
implementing the proposed approaches, the sensor network is configured for the

strategy to uncover the structure of subpopulations is to examine how they
respond differently to different drugs. For instance, PhenoPop was proposed as
a means to unravel the subpopulation structure within a tumor from
high-throughput drug screening data. However, the deterministic nature of
PhenoPop restricts the model fit and the information it can extract from the

attributed to the sublattice polarization energy scale, tuned by the degree of
alignment of the hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates typically used in van

and correlated insulating phases, while nearly perfectly aligned MATBG/hBN
exhibits zero-field Chern insulating phases and lacks superconductivity. Here
we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) to observe
gapped phases at partial fillings of the flat bands of MATBG in a new
intermediate regime of sublattice polarization, observed when MATBG is only
partially aligned ($\theta_{Gr-hBN}$ $\approx$ 1.65$^\circ$) to the underlying
hBN substrate. Under this condition, MATBG hosts not only phenomena that
naturally interpolate between the two sublattice potential limits, but also
unexpected gapped phases absent in either of these limits. At charge
neutrality, we observe an insulating phase with a small energy gap ($\Delta$ <
5 meV) likely related to weak sublattice symmetry breaking from the hBN
substrate. In addition, we observe new gapped phases near fractional fillings
$\nu$ = $\pm 1/3$ and $\nu$ = $\pm 1/6$, which have not been previously
observed in MATBG. Importantly, energy-resolved STS unambiguously identifies
these fractional filling states to be of single-particle origin, possibly a
result of the super-superlattice formed by two moir\'e superlattices. Our

gapped phases from many-body gapped phases in situations that could be easily

star formation rate density (\Sigma_SFR), produce disks with two tracks in the
[Fe/H]-[\alpha/Fe] chemical space, similar to that of the Milky Way's (MW's)
thin + thick disks. Here we investigate the effect of clumps on the bulge's
chemistry. The chemistry of the MW's bulge is comprised of a single track with
two density peaks separated by a trough. We show that the bulge chemistry of an
N-body + smoothed particle hydrodynamics clumpy simulation also has a single
track. Star formation within the bulge is itself in the high-\Sigma_SFR clumpy
mode, which ensures that the bulge's chemical track follows that of the thick
disk at low [Fe/H] and then extends to high [Fe/H], where it peaks. The peak at
low metallicity instead is comprised of a mixture of in-situ stars and stars
accreted via clumps. As a result, the trough between the peaks occurs at the
end of the thick disk track. We find that the high-metallicity peak dominates
near the mid-plane and declines in relative importance with height, as in the
MW. The bulge is already rapidly rotating by the end of the clump epoch, with
higher rotation at low [\alpha/Fe]. Thus clumpy star formation is able to

who have different roles (e.g., CEO, OSPO Lead, Ecosystem Strategist) at 17
different companies of different sizes from large companies (e.g. Microsoft,
RedHat, Google, Spotify) to startups. Data from semi-structured interviews
reveal that company motivations can be categorized into four levels (Founders'
Vision, Reputation, Business Advantage, and Reciprocity) and companies
participate through different mechanisms (e.g., Developers' Time, Mentoring

motivations. We hope our findings nudge more companies to participate in the

levels, from dextrous low-level skills to high-level planning and reasoning.
Recent pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning
ability in zero-shot robotic planning. However, it remains challenging to
ground LLMs in multimodal sensory input and continuous action output, while
enabling a robot to interact with its environment and acquire novel information
as its policies unfold. We develop a robot interaction scenario with a
partially observable state, which necessitates a robot to decide on a range of
epistemic actions in order to sample sensory information among multiple
modalities, before being able to execute the task correctly. An interactive
perception framework is therefore proposed with an LLM as its backbone, whose
ability is exploited to instruct epistemic actions and to reason over the
resulting multimodal sensations (vision, sound, haptics, proprioception), as
well as to plan an entire task execution based on the interactively acquired
information. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can provide high-level planning
and reasoning skills and control interactive robot behaviour in a multimodal
environment, while multimodal modules with the context of the environmental
state help ground the LLMs and extend their processing ability.

classification where the machine learning algorithm differentiates between a
set of positive instances (labeled) and a set of both positive and negative
instances (unlabeled). PU learning has broad applications in settings where
confirmed negatives are unavailable or difficult to obtain, and there is value
in discovering positives among the unlabeled (e.g., viable drugs among untested
compounds). Most PU learning algorithms make the selected completely at random
(SCAR) assumption, namely that positives are selected independently of their
features. However, in many real-world applications, such as healthcare,
positives are not SCAR (e.g., severe cases are more likely to be diagnosed),
leading to a poor estimate of the proportion, $\alpha$, of positives among
unlabeled examples and poor model calibration, resulting in an uncertain
decision threshold for selecting positives. PU learning algorithms can estimate
$\alpha$ or the probability of an individual unlabeled instance being positive
or both. We propose two PU learning algorithms to estimate $\alpha$, calculate
calibrated probabilities for PU instances, and improve classification metrics:
i) PULSCAR (positive unlabeled learning selected completely at random), and ii)
PULSNAR (positive unlabeled learning selected not at random). PULSNAR uses a
divide-and-conquer approach that creates and solves several SCAR-like
sub-problems using PULSCAR. In our experiments, PULSNAR outperformed

resulting in a function that takes values from signed 1-parameter persistence
modules. We show that the meta-rank and meta-diagram contain information
equivalent to the rank invariant and the signed barcode. This equivalence leads
to computational benefits, as we introduce an algorithm for computing the
meta-rank and meta-diagram of a 2-parameter module $M$ indexed by a
bifiltration of $n$ simplices in $O(n^3)$ time. This implies an improvement
upon the existing algorithm for computing the signed barcode, which has
$O(n^4)$ runtime. This also allows us to improve the existing upper bound on
the number of rectangles in the rank decomposition of $M$ from $O(n^4)$ to
$O(n^3)$. In addition, we define notions of erosion distance between meta-ranks
and between meta-diagrams, and show that under these distances, meta-ranks and
meta-diagrams are stable with respect to the interleaving distance. Lastly, the
meta-diagram can be visualized in an intuitive fashion as a persistence diagram

first disclosure of new materials prior to their publication in journals, and

feature modeling, as they mostly rely on aggregating information with local
neighborhoods. Furthermore, in order to learn point features at multiple
scales, most methods utilize a data-agnostic sampling approach to decrease the
number of points after each stage. Such sampling methods, however, often
discard points for small objects in the early stages, leading to inadequate
feature learning. We believe these issues are can be mitigated by introducing
explicit geometry clues as guidance. To this end, we propose GeoSpark, a
Plug-in module that incorporates Geometry clues into the network to Spark up
feature learning and downsampling. GeoSpark can be easily integrated into
various backbones. For feature aggregation, it improves feature modeling by
allowing the network to learn from both local points and neighboring geometry
partitions, resulting in an enlarged data-tailored receptive field.
Additionally, GeoSpark utilizes geometry partition information to guide the
downsampling process, where points with unique features are preserved while
redundant points are fused, resulting in better preservation of key points
throughout the network. We observed consistent improvements after adding
GeoSpark to various backbones including PointNet++, KPConv, and
PointTransformer. Notably, when integrated with Point Transformer, our GeoSpark
module achieves a 74.7% mIoU on the ScanNetv2 dataset (4.1% improvement) and
71.5% mIoU on the S3DIS Area 5 dataset (1.1% improvement), ranking top on both

to a 2013 conjecture of Banks and Martin, the sums $f_k$ are predicted to
decrease monotonically in $k$. In this article, we show the sums restricted to
odd integers are indeed monotonically decreasing in $k$, sufficiently large. By
contrast, contrary to the conjecture we prove the sums $f_k$ increase
monotonically in $k$, sufficiently large.
  Our main result gives an asymptotic for $f_k$ which identifies the (negative)
secondary term, i.e. $f_k = 1 - (a+o(1))k^2/2^k$ for an explicit constant $a=
.0656\cdots$. This is proven by a refined method combining real and complex

  cavitating flows",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Cavitation is a complex multiphase phenomenon characterised by vapour bubbles
forming due to a sudden pressure drop and is often accompanied by increased
hull vibrations, increased radiated noise and decrease in propeller and
impeller performance. Although the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)
method coupled with a cavitation model is still considered a practical tool to
predict cavitating flows owing to its computational efficiency, it is unable to
predict the unsteadiness of vapor shedding and over-predicts the eddy
viscosity. To improve the prediction, an empirical eddy viscosity
correction,[Reboud et al. 1998] was proposed to consider the compressibility
effects produced by cavitation. Additionally, a new type of models termed as
hybrid RANS-Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models have also been recently
introduced in the community, having the ability to behave as a RANS or a LES
model in different regions of the flow in order to combine the computational
cost efficiency of RANS with the accuracy of LES modelling. However, there
exists a lack of a comprehensive review of various such turbulence models like
the k-{\omega} Shear Stress Transport Model (SST), k-{\omega} SST
Scale-adaptive Simulation (SAS), k-{\omega} SST Detached Eddy Simulation (DES),
k-{\omega} SST Delayed DES (DDES), Filter-Based Method (FBM) and
Partially-Averaged Navier Stokes Method (PANS) to predict cavitating flows. In
this work, we conduct such a review to compare their ability to predict cloud
cavitating flows by comparing them with x-ray experimental data in a venturi.
It is shown that with mesh refinement, standard models do show the vapor
unsteadiness as seen in the experiment similar to that seen when using the
Reboud correction. However, on local comparison of turbulence quantities, it is
observed both forms of models have huge discrepancies with experimental data
that does not improve downstream.

smaller subcircuits in such a way that observables for the original circuits
can be estimated from measurements on the smaller subcircuits. Such techniques
provide workarounds for the limited numbers of qubits that are available on
near-term quantum devices. Wire cutting, however, introduces multiplicative
factors in the number of times such subcircuits need to be executed in order to
estimate desired quantum observables to desired levels of statistical accuracy.
An optimal wire-cutting methodology has recently been reported that uses
ancilla qubits to minimize the multiplicative factors involved as a function of
the number of wire cuts. Until just recently, the best-known wire-cutting
technique that did not employ ancillas asymptotically converged to the same
multiplicative factors, but performed significantly worse for small numbers of
cuts. This latter technique also requires inserting measurement and
state-preparation subcircuits that are randomly sampled from Clifford 2-designs
on a per-shot basis. This paper presents a modified wire-cutting approach for
pairs of subcircuits that achieves the same optimal multiplicative factors as
wire cutting aided by ancilla qubits, but without requiring ancillas. The paper
also shows that, while unitary 2-designs provide a sufficient basis for
satisfying the decomposition, 2-designs are not mathematically necessary and
alternative unitary designs can be constructed for the decompositions that are
substantially smaller in size than 2-designs. As this paper was just about to
be released, a similar result was published, so we also include a comparison of
the two approaches.

function, where samples are embedded into the high-dimensional Hilbert space

QAML model employs entanglement and interference to build superposition states
for triplet samples so that only one parameterized quantum circuit is needed to
calculate sample distances, which reduces the demand for quantum resources.
Considering the QAML model is fragile to adversarial attacks, an adversarial
sample generation strategy is designed based on the quantum gradient ascent
method, effectively improving the robustness against the functional adversarial
attack. Simulation results show that the QAML model can effectively distinguish
samples of MNIST and Iris datasets and has higher robustness accuracy over the
general quantum metric learning. The QAML model is a fundamental research

simulations and theoretical method, that the anharmonicity dependence of
$\kappa$ in the HT model is nonmonotonous, while in the ST model is
monotonously increased. This provides a new way to enhance thermal conductivity
in disordered systems. Furthermore, $\kappa$ of the HT model is consistent with
the prediction of the quasi-harmonic Green-Kubo (QHGK) method in a wide range

ratio of energy to frequency (which does not hold for zero frequency) is
reestablished again, but with the proportionality coefficient dependent on the
initial state. The dependence on the initial state disappears after averaging
over phases of initial states with the same energy (in particular, for the
initial vacuum, Fock and thermal quantum states). In this case, the mean
proportionality coefficient is always greater than unity. The concrete value of
the mean proportionality coefficient depends on the power index of the
frequency dependence on time near zero point. In particular, the mean energy
triplicates if the frequency tends to zero linearly. If the frequency attains
zero more than once, the adiabatic proportionality coefficient strongly depends
on lengths of time intervals between zero points, so that the mean energy
behavior turns out quasi-stochastic after many passages through zero value. The
original Born-Fock theorem does not work after the frequency passes through
zero. However, its generalization is found: the initial Fock state becomes a
wide superposition of many Fock states, whose weights do not depend on time in
the new adiabatic regime. When the mean energy triplicates, the initial Nth
Fock state becomes a superposition of, roughly speaking, 6N states, distributed
non-uniformly. The initial vacuum and low-order Fock states become squeezed, as
well as initial thermal states with low values of the mean energy.

  Anticipation","AAMAS 2023 Workshop on Optimization and Learning in Multi-Agent
  Systems",,,,"cs.MA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Learning anticipation is a reasoning paradigm in multi-agent reinforcement
learning, where agents, during learning, consider the anticipated learning of
other agents. There has been substantial research into the role of learning
anticipation in improving cooperation among self-interested agents in
general-sum games. Two primary examples are Learning with Opponent-Learning
Awareness (LOLA), which anticipates and shapes the opponent's learning process
to ensure cooperation among self-interested agents in various games such as
iterated prisoner's dilemma, and Look-Ahead (LA), which uses learning
anticipation to guarantee convergence in games with cyclic behaviors. So far,
the effectiveness of applying learning anticipation to fully-cooperative games
has not been explored. In this study, we aim to research the influence of
learning anticipation on coordination among common-interested agents. We first
illustrate that both LOLA and LA, when applied to fully-cooperative games,
degrade coordination among agents, causing worst-case outcomes. Subsequently,
to overcome this miscoordination behavior, we propose Hierarchical Learning
Anticipation (HLA), where agents anticipate the learning of other agents in a
hierarchical fashion. Specifically, HLA assigns agents to several hierarchy
levels to properly regulate their reasonings. Our theoretical and empirical
findings confirm that HLA can significantly improve coordination among
common-interested agents in fully-cooperative normal-form games. With HLA, to
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to unlock the benefits of learning
anticipation for fully-cooperative games.

proven successful in automatically designing low-FLOPs INT8 quantized neural
networks (QNN). However, directly applying NAS to design accurate QNN models
that achieve low latency on real-world devices leads to inferior performance.
In this work, we find that the poor INT8 latency is due to the
quantization-unfriendly issue: the operator and configuration (e.g., channel
width) choices in prior art search spaces lead to diverse quantization
efficiency and can slow down the INT8 inference speed. To address this
challenge, we propose SpaceEvo, an automatic method for designing a dedicated,
quantization-friendly search space for each target hardware. The key idea of
SpaceEvo is to automatically search hardware-preferred operators and
configurations to construct the search space, guided by a metric called Q-T
score to quantify how quantization-friendly a candidate search space is. We
further train a quantized-for-all supernet over our discovered search space,
enabling the searched models to be directly deployed without extra retraining
or quantization. Our discovered models establish new SOTA INT8 quantized
accuracy under various latency constraints, achieving up to 10.1% accuracy
improvement on ImageNet than prior art CNNs under the same latency. Extensive
experiments on diverse edge devices demonstrate that SpaceEvo consistently
outperforms existing manually-designed search spaces with up to 2.5x faster
speed while achieving the same accuracy.

good mechanical properties, corrosion resistance, and a low thermal neutron
absorption cross section. However, the mechanical performance of Zircaloy-4 can
be reduced during service due to hydrogen uptake and hydride formation. These
hydrides are brittle, and often reduce the strength and toughness of materials
as well as increase susceptibility to delayed hydride cracking (DHC). In this
work, large grain Zircaloy-4 with hydrides was prepared and then cross
sectioned using cryo-ion beam polishing, using plasma focused ion beam (pFIB)
and broad ion beam (BIB) approaches to enable the preparation of a very high
quality flat surface with no preferential etching of either the hydride or
zirconium metal (typically metallographic polishing preferentially removes
hydrides). Conventional and high angular resolution electron backscatter
diffraction (EBSD) analysis were then used to explore morphology, deformation
fields, and orientation relationships between the zirconium matrix and
hydrides. Four maps were collected for analysis which included hydrides near
grain boundaries: (a) where the hydride smoothly decorates across two of the
connecting boundaries near a triple junction; (b) where the hydride smoothly
decorates the boundary; (c) a mixture of smooth decoration of the interface and
protrusion into the grains; (d) fine scale hydride that protrudes into one
grain. This work highlights that incompatibility of the hydride within the
zirconium matrix is strongly linked to the orientation relationship of the
hydride and matrix, and the grain boundary character. These results may enable
enhanced understanding of the role of hydrides in fracture as well as
stress-induced hydride reorientation and DHC susceptibility.

estimation and quantization errors exist. The proposed structure jointly
optimizes the encoders and decoders to generate interferenceaware
constellations that adapt their shape to the interference intensity in order to
minimize the bit error rate. A normalization layer is designed to guarantee an
average power constraint in the DAE while allowing the architecture to generate
constellations with nonuniform shapes. This brings further shaping gain
compared to standard uniform constellations such as quadrature amplitude
modulation. The performance of the DAE-ZIC is compared with two conventional
methods, i.e., standard and rotated constellations. The proposed structure
significantly enhances the performance of the ZIC. Simulation results confirm
bit error rate reduction in all interference regimes (weak, moderate, and
strong). At a signal-to-noise ratio of 20dB, the improvements reach about two
orders of magnitude when only quantization error exists, indicating that the
DAE-ZIC is highly robust to the interference compared to the conventional

universe. To reconstruct the density field from the shear catalog, an important
step is to build the shear field from the shear catalog, which can be quite
nontrivial due to the inhomogeneity of the background galaxy distribution and
the shape noise. We propose the PDF-Folding method as a statistically optimal
way of reconstructing the shear field. It is an extention of the PDF-SYM
method, which is previously designed for optimizing the stacked shear signal as
well as the shear-shear correlation. PDF-Folding does not require smoothing
kernels as in traditional methods, therefore it suffers less information loss
on small scales, and avoids possible biases due to the spatial variation of
shear on the scale of the kernel. We show with analytic reasoning as well as
numerical examples that the new method can reach the optimal signal-to-noise
ratio on the reconstructed shear map under general observing conditions, i.e.,
with inhomogeneous background densities or masks. We also show the performance
of the new method with real shear data around foreground galaxy clusters.

  from Point Cloud Sequences","Accepted by CVPR2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Point cloud sequences are commonly used to accurately detect 3D objects in
applications such as autonomous driving. Current top-performing multi-frame
detectors mostly follow a Detect-and-Fuse framework, which extracts features
from each frame of the sequence and fuses them to detect the objects in the
current frame. However, this inevitably leads to redundant computation since
adjacent frames are highly correlated. In this paper, we propose an efficient
Motion-guided Sequential Fusion (MSF) method, which exploits the continuity of
object motion to mine useful sequential contexts for object detection in the
current frame. We first generate 3D proposals on the current frame and
propagate them to preceding frames based on the estimated velocities. The
points-of-interest are then pooled from the sequence and encoded as proposal
features. A novel Bidirectional Feature Aggregation (BiFA) module is further
proposed to facilitate the interactions of proposal features across frames.
Besides, we optimize the point cloud pooling by a voxel-based sampling
technique so that millions of points can be processed in several milliseconds.
The proposed MSF method achieves not only better efficiency than other
multi-frame detectors but also leading accuracy, with 83.12% and 78.30% mAP on
the LEVEL1 and LEVEL2 test sets of Waymo Open Dataset, respectively. Codes can

existing tag relation construction methods suffer from either deficient

tag relation, video-tag annotation, and user-follow relation to build the
network. Afterward, a better video and tag representation are derived through
Behavior Spread modeling and visual and linguistic knowledge aggregation.
Finally, the semantic similarity between each micro-video and all candidate

magnonic excitations in the ferromagnet. While short ranged interactions turn
out to be irrelevant by power counting, we show that sufficiently strong and
long-ranged interactions may induce a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry breaking. This
spontaneous breaking leads to a tilting of the magnetization perpendicular to
the Majorana propagation direction and the opening of a fermionic gap (Majorana
mass). It is analogous to the Peierls instability in the commensurate
Fr\""ohlich model and reflects the nontrivial interplay between Majorana modes
and magnetization dynamics. Within a Gaussian fluctuation analysis, we estimate
critical values for the temporal and spatial non-locality of the interaction,
beyond which the symmetry breaking is stable at zero temperature -- despite the
effective one-dimensionality of the model. We conclude that non-locality, i.e.,
the stiffness of the magnetization in space and time, stabilizes the symmetry
breaking. In the stabilized regime, we expect the current-phase relation to
exhibit an experimentally accessible discontinuous jump. At nonzero
temperatures, as usual in the 1D Ising model, the long-range order is destroyed

Stochastic GDS has been used for network-based epidemics models such as the

stochastic GDS that are also continuous-time Markov processes (CTMP), whose
transition rates are linear functions of some dynamics parameters $\theta$ of
interest (i.e., healing, exogeneous, and endogeneous infection rates). Our goal
is to estimate $\theta$ from a single, finite-time, continuously observed
trajectory of the CTMP. Parameter estimation of CTMP is challenging when the
state space is large; for GDS, the number of Markov states are
\emph{exponential} in the number of nodes of the graph. We showed that holding
classes (i.e., Markov states with the same holding time distribution) give
efficient partitions of the state space of GDS. We derived an upperbound on the
number of holding classes for the contact process, which is polynomial in the
number of nodes. We utilized holding classes to solve a smaller system of
linear equations to find $\theta$. Experimental results show that finding
reasonable results can be achieved even for short trajectories, particularly

fields of computer vision, leveraging the overfitting ability of the DNN to
achieve video resolution upscaling has become a new trend in the modern video
delivery system. By dividing videos into chunks and overfitting each chunk with
a super-resolution model, the server encodes videos before transmitting them to
the clients, thus achieving better video quality and transmission efficiency.
However, a large number of chunks are expected to ensure good overfitting
quality, which substantially increases the storage and consumes more bandwidth
resources for data transmission. On the other hand, decreasing the number of
chunks through training optimization techniques usually requires high model
capacity, which significantly slows down execution speed. To reconcile such, we
propose a novel method for high-quality and efficient video resolution
upscaling tasks, which leverages the spatial-temporal information to accurately
divide video into chunks, thus keeping the number of chunks as well as the
model size to minimum. Additionally, we advance our method into a single
overfitting model by a data-aware joint training technique, which further
reduces the storage requirement with negligible quality drop. We deploy our
models on an off-the-shelf mobile phone, and experimental results show that our
method achieves real-time video super-resolution with high video quality.

applications require the delivery of volumetric video to users with six degrees
of freedom (6-DoF) movements. Point Cloud has become a popular volumetric video
format due to its flexibility and simplicity. A dense point cloud consumes much
higher bandwidth than a 2D/360 degree video frame. User Field of View (FoV) is
more dynamic with 6-DoF movement than 3-DoF movement. A user's view quality of
a 3D object is affected by points occlusion and distance, which are constantly
changing with user and object movements. To save bandwidth, FoV-adaptive
streaming predicts user FoV and only downloads the data falling in the
predicted FoV, but it is vulnerable to FoV prediction errors, which is
significant when a long buffer is used for smoothed streaming. In this work, we
propose a multi-round progressive refinement framework for point cloud-based
volumetric video streaming. Instead of sequentially downloading frames, we
simultaneously downloads/patches multiple frames falling into a sliding
time-window, leveraging on the scalability of point-cloud coding. The rate
allocation among all tiles of active frames are solved analytically using the
heterogeneous tile utility functions calibrated by the predicted user FoV.
Multi-frame patching takes advantage of the streaming smoothness resulted from
long buffer and the FoV prediction accuracy at short buffer length. We evaluate
our solution using simulations driven by real point cloud videos, bandwidth

compared with the magnetic pressure, which is the case during the cold vertical
displacement event (VDE) of a major disruption in a tokamak. On time scales
long compared with the transit time of Alfven waves, the evolution of a
force-free plasma is most efficiently described by the quasi-static
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, which ignores the plasma inertia. Here we
consider a regularized quasi-static MHD model for force-free plasmas in tokamak
disruptions and propose a mimetic finite difference (MFD) algorithm. The full
geometry of an ITER-like tokamak reactor is treated, with a blanket module
region, a vacuum vessel region, and the plasma region. Specifically, we develop
a parallel, fully implicit, and scalable MFD solver based on PETSc and its
DMStag data structure for the discretization of the five-field quasi-static
perpendicular plasma dynamics model on a 3D structured mesh. The MFD spatial
discretization is coupled with a fully implicit DIRK scheme. The algorithm
exactly preserves the divergence-free condition of the magnetic field under the
resistive Ohm's law. The preconditioner employed is a four-level fieldsplit
preconditioner, which is created by combining separate preconditioners for
individual fields, that calls multigrid or direct solvers for sub-blocks or
exact factorization on the separate fields. The numerical results confirm the
divergence-free constraint is strongly satisfied and demonstrate the
performance of the fieldsplit preconditioner and overall algorithm. The
simulation of ITER VDE cases over the actual plasma current diffusion time is
also presented.

We consider the case where the density of the subgraph is either constant or

In contrast to previous methods that learn to estimate optical flow from two

MOtion Propagation (MOP) module that bridges multiple TROFs and propagates
motion features between adjacent TROFs. With the iterative flow estimation
refinement, the information fused in individual TROFs can be propagated into
the whole sequence via MOP. By effectively exploiting video information,
VideoFlow presents extraordinary performance, ranking 1st on all public

query description. Despite the recent advance in short-form videos
(\textit{e.g.}, in minutes), temporal grounding in long videos (\textit{e.g.},
in hours) is still at its early stage. To address this challenge, a common
practice is to employ a sliding window, yet can be inefficient and inflexible
due to the limited number of frames within the window. In this work, we propose
an end-to-end framework for fast temporal grounding, which is able to model an
hours-long video with \textbf{one-time} network execution. Our pipeline is
formulated in a coarse-to-fine manner, where we first extract context knowledge
from non-overlapped video clips (\textit{i.e.}, anchors), and then supplement
the anchors that highly response to the query with detailed content knowledge.
Besides the remarkably high pipeline efficiency, another advantage of our
approach is the capability of capturing long-range temporal correlation, thanks
to modeling the entire video as a whole, and hence facilitates more accurate
grounding. Experimental results suggest that, on the long-form video datasets
MAD and Ego4d, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts, and

prediction accuracy of user preference by leveraging GNN in exploiting
preference similarity contained in social relations. However, in terms of both
effectiveness and efficiency of recommendation, a large portion of social
relations can be redundant or even noisy, e.g., it is quite normal that friends
share no preference in a certain domain. Existing models do not fully solve
this problem of relation redundancy and noise, as they directly characterize
social influence over the full social network. In this paper, we instead
propose to improve graph based social recommendation by only retaining the
informative social relations to ensure an efficient and effective influence
diffusion, i.e., graph denoising. Our designed denoising method is
preference-guided to model social relation confidence and benefits user
preference learning in return by providing a denoised but more informative
social graph for recommendation models. Moreover, to avoid interference of
noisy social relations, it designs a self-correcting curriculum learning module
and an adaptive denoising strategy, both favoring highly-confident samples.
Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate its consistent
capability of improving two state-of-the-art social recommendation models by
robustly removing 10-40% of original relations. We release the source code at

of efficient solutions to approximation problems involving convex bodies.
Intuitively, given a convex body $K$ and $\epsilon> 0$, a covering is a
collection of convex bodies whose union covers $K$ such that a constant factor
expansion of each body lies within an $\epsilon$ expansion of $K$. Coverings
have been employed in many applications, such as approximations for diameter,
width, and $\epsilon$-kernels of point sets, approximate nearest neighbor
searching, polytope approximations, and approximations to the Closest Vector
Problem (CVP).
  It is known how to construct coverings of size $n^{O(n)} /
\epsilon^{(n-1)/2}$ for general convex bodies in $\textbf{R}^n$. In special
cases, such as when the convex body is the $\ell_p$ unit ball, this bound has
been improved to $2^{O(n)} / \epsilon^{(n-1)/2}$. This raises the question of
whether such a bound generally holds. In this paper we answer the question in
the affirmative.
  We demonstrate the power and versatility of our coverings by applying them to
the problem of approximating a convex body by a polytope, under the
Banach-Mazur metric. Given a well-centered convex body $K$ and an approximation
parameter $\epsilon> 0$, we show that there exists a polytope $P$ consisting of
$2^{O(n)} / \epsilon^{(n-1)/2}$ vertices (facets) such that $K \subset P
\subset K(1+\epsilon)$. This bound is optimal in the worst case up to factors
of $2^{O(n)}$. As an additional consequence, we obtain the fastest
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate CVP algorithm that works in any norm, with a running
time of $2^{O(n)} / \epsilon ^{(n-1)/2}$ up to polynomial factors in the input
size, and we obtain the fastest $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for
integer programming. We also present a framework for constructing coverings of
optimal size for any convex body (up to factors of $2^{O(n)}$).

heterostructures is systematically investigated using a combined experimental
and theoretical approach. On the experimental side, GaN/AlN RTDs are grown by
MBE. In-situ electron diffraction is employed to monitor the number of
monolayers incorporated into each tunneling barrier. Using this precise
epitaxial control at the monolayer level, we demonstrate exponential modulation
of the resonant tunneling current as a function of barrier thickness. Both the
peak voltage and characteristic threshold bias exhibit a dependence on barrier
thickness as a result of the intense electric fields present in the polar
heterostructures. To get further insight into the asymmetric tunneling
injection, we present an analytical theory for tunneling transport across polar
heterostructures. A general expression for the resonant tunneling current with
contributions from coherent and sequential tunneling processes is introduced.
After applying this theory to the case of GaN/AlN RTDs, their experimental
current-voltage characteristics are reproduced over both bias polarities, with
tunneling currents spanning several orders of magnitude. This agreement allows
us to elucidate the role played by the internal polarization fields on the
magnitude of the tunneling current and broadening of the resonant line shape.
Under reverse bias, we identify new tunneling features originating from highly
attenuated resonant tunneling phenomena, which are completely captured by our
model. Our analytical model, provides a simple expression which reveals the
connection between the polar RTD design parameters and its current-voltage
characteristics. This new theory paves the way for the design of polar resonant
tunneling devices exhibiting efficient resonant current injection and enhanced
tunneling dynamics, as required in various practical applications.

The system can generate states with a high degree of entanglement gauged by the

share customers' sensitive information with an external credit bureau to
generate a prediction model that opens the door to privacy leakage. This
leakage risk makes financial companies face an enormous challenge in their
cooperation. Federated learning is a machine learning setting that can protect
data privacy, but the high communication cost is often the bottleneck of the
federated systems, especially for large neural networks. Limiting the number
and size of communications is necessary for the practical training of large
neural structures. Gradient sparsification has received increasing attention as
a method to reduce communication cost, which only updates significant gradients
and accumulates insignificant gradients locally. However, the secure
aggregation framework cannot directly use gradient sparsification. This article
proposes two sparsification methods to reduce communication cost in federated
learning. One is a time-varying hierarchical sparsification method for model
parameter update, which solves the problem of maintaining model accuracy after
high ratio sparsity. It can significantly reduce the cost of a single
communication. The other is to apply the sparsification method to the secure
aggregation framework. We sparse the encryption mask matrix to reduce the cost
of communication while protecting privacy. Experiments show that under
different Non-IID experiment settings, our method can reduce the upload
communication cost to about 2.9% to 18.9% of the conventional federated
learning algorithm when the sparse rate is 0.01.

deep instance-level contrastive network, namely DICNet. Different from
conventional methods, our DICNet focuses on leveraging deep neural network to
exploit the high-level semantic representations of samples rather than
shallow-level features. First, we utilize the stacked autoencoders to build an
end-to-end multi-view feature extraction framework to learn the view-specific
representations of samples. Furthermore, in order to improve the consensus
representation ability, we introduce an incomplete instance-level contrastive
learning scheme to guide the encoders to better extract the consensus
information of multiple views and use a multi-view weighted fusion module to
enhance the discrimination of semantic features. Overall, our DICNet is adept
in capturing consistent discriminative representations of multi-view

labels. Extensive experiments performed on five datasets validate that our

module that can be integrated with micro-sized surgical instruments such as
biopsy forceps. The proposed miniature sensing module mainly consists of a
flexure, a camera, and a target. The deformation of the flexure is obtained by
the pose variation of the top-mounted target, which is estimated by the camera
with a proposed pose estimation algorithm. Then, the external force is
estimated using the flexure's displacement and stiffness matrix. Integrating
the sensing module, we further develop a pair of haptics-enabled forceps and
realize its multi-modal force sensing, including touching, grasping, and
pulling when the forceps manipulate tissues. To minimize the unexpected sliding
between the forceps' clips and the tissue, we design a micro-level actuator to
drive the forceps and compensate for the motion introduced by the flexure's
deformation. Finally, a series of experiments are conducted to verify the
feasibility of the proposed sensing module and forceps, including an automatic
robotic grasping procedure on ex-vivo tissues. The results indicate the sensing

that the logit-based method is not well-suited for multi-label classification,
as the teacher fails to provide inter-category similarity information or

heterogeneity in edge/fog networks through enabling a model/data/resource

features. The prior arts for optical flow or deep point set tracking are

points on the contour, unsupervised learning comprised of the mechanical and
cyclical consistency losses is proposed to train our contour tracker. The
mechanical loss forcing the points to move perpendicular to the contour
effectively helps out. For quantitative evaluation, we labeled sparse tracking
points along the contour of live cells from two live cell datasets taken with

using generative modeling for accommodating uncertainty and multi-modality in
human behaviors. An individual's inherent uncertainty, e.g., change of
destination, can be masked by complex patterns resulting from the movements of
interacting pedestrians. However, latent variable-based generative models often
entangle such uncertainty with complexity, leading to either limited
expressivity or overconfident predictions. In this work, we propose to
separately model these two factors by implicitly deriving a flexible
distribution that describes complex pedestrians' movements, whereas
incorporating predictive uncertainty of individuals with explicit density
functions over their future locations. More specifically, we present an
uncertainty-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction framework, parameterizing
sufficient statistics for the distributions of locations that jointly comprise
the multi-modal trajectories. We further estimate these parameters of interest
by approximating a denoising process that progressively recovers pedestrian
movements from noise. Unlike prior studies, we translate the predictive
stochasticity to the explicit distribution, making it readily used to generate
plausible future trajectories indicating individuals' self-uncertainty.
Moreover, our framework is model-agnostic for compatibility with different
neural network architectures. We empirically show the performance advantages of
our framework on widely-used benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art in most

direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. A large number of antennas used in a
MIMO system imposes a huge complexity burden on the popular DOA estimation
algorithms, such as MUSIC and ESPRIT due to the implementation of eigenvalue
decomposition. This renders those algorithms impractical in applications
requiring quick DOA estimation. Consequently, we theoretically derive several
useful noise subspace vectors when the number of signal sources is less than
the number of elements in both the transmitter and receiver sides. Those noise
subspace vectors are then utilized to formulate a 2D-constrained minimization
problem, solved iteratively to obtain the DOAs of all the sources in a scene.
The convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm has been mathematically as
well as numerically demonstrated. Depending on the number of iterations, our
algorithm can provide significant complexity gain over the existing
high-resolution 2D DOA estimation algorithms in MIMO systems, such as MUSIC,
while exhibiting comparable performance for a moderate to high signal-to-noise

the impressive performance of NeRF, where low-dimensional coordinates are

blindly increasing the frequency of P.E. leads to overfitting when the

finishing details with a high-frequency equipped field. Unlike most existing

regularization is conducted in the input space (\ie, signal frequency). We
further propose a simple-yet-effective strategy for tuning the frequency to
avoid overfitting few-shot inputs: enforcing consistency among the frequency
domain of rendered 2D images. Thanks to the input space regularizing scheme,
our method readily applies to inputs beyond spatial locations, such as the time

effect of spin-Hall effect and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI).
However, only Neel wall can be effectively driven in the latter system. In this
paper, we show that both Bloch and Neel domain walls can be effectively moved
by exploiting the field-like torque with the out-of-plane spin polarization,
which can be generated in materials with reduced symmetry. In addition, we find
that the Neel wall and Bloch walls stabilized by the magnetostatic energy are
easily distorted by the spin-orbit torque and they then enter the Walker
breakdown region. External magnetic field and DMI are introduced to stabilize
the domain wall, and a very high domain wall velocity over 500 m/s is obtained
at a moderate current density of $2\times 10^{11} A/m^2$. In principle, this

negotiation in interactions, such as in encounter scenarios. However,
pedestrians with limited experience in negotiating with AVs could lack a
comprehensive and correct understanding of the information on driving
intentions' meaning as conveyed by AVs through eHMI, particularly in the
current contexts where AV and eHMI are not yet mainstream. Consequently,
pedestrians who misunderstand the driving intention of the AVs during the
encounter may feel threatened and perform unpredictable behaviors. To solve
this issue, this study proposes using the pre-instruction on the rationale of
eHMI to help pedestrians correctly understand driving intentions and predict AV
behavior. Consequently, this can improve their subjective feelings (ie. sense
of danger, trust in AV, and sense of relief) and decision-making. In addition,
this study suggests that the eHMI could better guide pedestrian behavior
through the pre-instruction. The results of interaction experiments in the road
crossing scene show that participants found it more difficult to recognize the
situation when they encountered an AV without eHMI than when they encountered a
manual driving vehicle (MV); in addition, participants' subjective feelings and
hesitations while decision-making worsened significantly. After the
pre-instruction, the participants could understand the driving intention of an
AV with eHMI and predict driving behavior more easily. Furthermore, the
participants' subjective feelings and hesitation to make decisions improved,
reaching the same criteria used for MV. Moreover, this study found that the
information guidance of using eHMI influenced the participants' walking speed,
resulting in a small variation over the time horizon via multiple trials when
they fully understood the principle of eHMI through the pre-instruction.

elusive connection between galaxy mergers and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We
present an analysis of nuclear X-ray emission in an optically selected sample
of 92 close galaxy pairs (with projected separations $\lesssim 20$ kpc and
line-of-sight velocity offsets $<$ 500 km s$^{-1}$) at low redshift ($\bar{z}
\sim 0.07$), based on archival Chandra observations. The parent sample of
galaxy pairs is constructed without imposing an optical classification of
nuclear activity, thus is largely free of selection effect for or against the
presence of an AGN. Nor is this sample biased for or against gas-rich mergers.
An X-ray source is detected in 70 of the 184 nuclei, giving a detection rate of
$38\%^{+5\%}_{-5\%}$, down to a 0.5-8 keV limiting luminosity of $\lesssim
10^{40}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$. The detected and undetected nuclei show no systematic
difference in their host galaxy properties such as galaxy morphology, stellar
mass and stellar velocity dispersion. When potential contamination from star
formation is avoided (i.e., $L_{\rm 2-10~keV} > 10^{41}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$), the
detection rate becomes $18\%^{+3\%}_{-3\%}$ (32/184), which shows no excess
compared to the X-ray detection rate of a comparison sample of optically
classified single AGNs. The fraction of pairs containing dual AGN is only
$2\%^{+2\%}_{-2\%}$. Moreover, most nuclei at the smallest projected
separations probed by our sample (a few kpc) have an unexpectedly low apparent
X-ray luminosity and Eddington ratio, which cannot be solely explained by
circumnuclear obscuration. These findings suggest that close galaxy interaction
is not a sufficient condition for triggering a high level of AGN activity.

the YSO eruptive variable class aids our understanding of the episodic
accretion phenomenon and its possible impact on stellar and planetary
formation. A previous analysis of 6.5 yr of NeoWISE light curves (3-5 $\mu$m)
of ~7000 nearby YSOs found an increase in the fraction of variability and
variability amplitude for objects at younger stages of evolution. To help
interpret these light curves, we have obtained low- and high-resolution near-IR

processor market, optimizing server processors for cloud workloads by better
understanding their behavior has become crucial. To address this, in this
paper, we present MemProf, a memory profiler that profiles the three major
reasons for stalls in cloud workloads: code-fetch, memory bandwidth, and memory
latency. We use MemProf to understand the behavior of cloud workloads and
propose and evaluate micro-architectural and memory system design improvements
that help cloud workloads' performance.
  MemProf's code analysis shows that cloud workloads execute the same code
across CPU cores. Using this, we propose shared micro-architectural
structures--a shared L2 I-TLB and a shared L2 cache. Next, to help with memory
bandwidth stalls, using workloads' memory bandwidth distribution, we find that
only a few pages contribute to most of the system bandwidth. We use this
finding to evaluate a new high-bandwidth, small-capacity memory tier and show
that it performs 1.46x better than the current baseline configuration. Finally,
we look into ways to improve memory latency for cloud workloads. Profiling
using MemProf reveals that L2 hardware prefetchers, a common solution to reduce
memory latency, have very low coverage and consume a significant amount of
memory bandwidth. To help improve hardware prefetcher performance, we built a
memory tracing tool to collect and validate production memory access traces.

first detection to the gravitational wave, the event GW150914, a brand new
window has been opened to testing the theory of gravity with gravitational wave

describes a wormhole-like geometry under the Einstein-$\AE$ther theory. Taking
advantage of this set of analytic background solutions, we are able to simplify
the Lagrangian and construct a set of coupled single-parameter dependent master
equations, from which we solve for the quasi-normal modes that carry the

reflect a consistency between Einstein-$\AE$ther theory and general relativity.

literature put most emphasis on interpreting instructions into actions, only
delivering ""dumb"" wayfinding agents. In this article, we devise LANA, a
language-capable navigation agent which is able to not only execute
human-written navigation commands, but also provide route descriptions to
humans. This is achieved by simultaneously learning instruction following and
generation with only one single model. More specifically, two encoders,
respectively for route and language encoding, are built and shared by two
decoders, respectively, for action prediction and instruction generation, so as
to exploit cross-task knowledge and capture task-specific characteristics.
Throughout pretraining and fine-tuning, both instruction following and
generation are set as optimization objectives. We empirically verify that,
compared with recent advanced task-specific solutions, LANA attains better
performances on both instruction following and route description, with nearly
half complexity. In addition, endowed with language generation capability, LANA
can explain to humans its behaviors and assist human's wayfinding. This work is
expected to foster future efforts towards building more trustworthy and
socially-intelligent navigation robots.

dark matter candidates and can potentially be detected through their coupling
to the electromagnetic field. Recently a novel detection technique using the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) was proposed, which relies on the fact that
the axion field oscillates at a frequency equal to its mass in appropriate
units, leading to a time-dependent birefringence. For appropriate oscillation
periods this allows the axion field at the telescope to be detected via the
induced sinusoidal oscillation of the CMB linear polarization. We search for
this effect in two years of POLARBEAR data. We do not detect a signal, and
place a median $95 \%$ upper limit of $0.65 ^\circ$ on the sinusoid amplitude
for oscillation frequencies between $0.02\,\text{days}^{-1}$ and
$0.45\,\text{days}^{-1}$, which corresponds to axion masses between $9.6 \times
10^{-22} \, \text{eV}$ and $2.2\times 10^{-20} \,\text{eV}$. Under the
assumptions that 1) the axion constitutes all the dark matter and 2) the axion
field amplitude is a Rayleigh-distributed stochastic variable, this translates
to a limit on the axion-photon coupling $g_{\phi \gamma} < 2.4 \times 10^{-11}

distributed multichannel active noise control (DMCANC) techniques have become
effective global noise reduction solutions with low computational costs.
However, existing DMCANC algorithms simply complete the distribution of
traditional centralized algorithms by combining neighbour nodes' information
but rarely consider the degraded control performance and system stability of
distributed units caused by delays and interruptions in communication. Hence,
this paper develops a novel DMCANC algorithm that utilizes the compensation
filters and neighbour nodes' information to counterbalance the cross-talk

the neighbours' information required barely affects the local control filter

A fundamental algorithm is the decentralized projected gradient method (DPG)

new convergence estimates of DPG when the aggregate cost $f$ is strongly convex

To achieve this, we introduce the Multi-Confidence Mask (MCM), which is a
combination of a Low-Confidence (LC) Mask and a High-Confidence (HC) Mask. The
LC mask indicates regions with a low segmentation confidence, which may cause
different segmentation options among radiologists. Following UAAM, we further
design an Uncertainty-Guide Segmentation Network (UGS-Net), which contains
three modules: a Feature Extracting Module that captures a general feature of a
lung nodule, an Uncertainty-Aware Module that produces three features for the
annotations' union, intersection, and annotation set, and an Intersection-Union
Constraining Module that uses distances between the three features to balance
the predictions of final segmentation, LC mask, and HC mask. To fully
demonstrate the performance of our method, we propose a Complex Nodule
Validation on LIDC-IDRI, which tests UGS-Net's segmentation performance on lung
nodules that are difficult to segment using U-Net. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the segmentation
performance on nodules with poor segmentation by U-Net.

developed and have outperformed CCDs in several aspects: higher readout frame
rate, higher radiation tolerance, and higher working temperature. For silicon
image sensors, image lag will occur when the charges of an event are not fully
transferred inside pixels. It can degrade the image quality for optical
imaging, and deteriorate the energy resolution for X-ray spectroscopy. In this
work, the image lag of a sCMOS sensor is studied. To measure the image lag
under low-light illumination, we constructed a new method to extract the image
lag from X-ray photons. The image lag of a customized X-ray sCMOS sensor
GSENSE1516BSI is measured, and its influence on X-ray performance is evaluated.
The result shows that the image lag of this sensor exists only in the
immediately subsequent frame and is always less than 0.05% for different
incident photon energies and under different experimental conditions. The
residual charge is smaller than 0.5 e- with the highest incident photon charge
around 8 ke-. Compared to the readout noise level around 3 e-, the image lag of
this sensor is too small to have a significant impact on the imaging quality
and the energy resolution. The image lag shows a positive correlation with the
incident photon energy and a negative correlation with the temperature.
However, it has no dependence on the gain setting and the integration time.
These relations can be explained qualitatively by the non-ideal potential
structure inside the pixels. This method can also be applied to the study of
image lag for other kinds of imaging sensors.

Optimization Structure Search method with integrated density-functional-theory

that disorder grows with increasing temperature, and reveals that the materials

drastic improvement in artefact removal, to the extent that the local noise
around severely affected sources was halved and ultimately resulted in a 7\%
improvement in global image noise. Thereafter, using these spectrally
deconvolved Stokes I continuum images, we directly measure for four mini-halos
the flux density, radio power, size and in-band integrated spectra. Further to
that, we show the in-band spectral index maps of the mini-halo (with point

aim to seek a fundamental understanding of the benefits of Mixup. We first show
that Mixup using different linear interpolation parameters for features and
labels can still achieve similar performance to the standard Mixup. This
indicates that the intuitive linearity explanation in Zhang et al., (2018) may
not fully explain the success of Mixup. Then we perform a theoretical study of
Mixup from the feature learning perspective. We consider a feature-noise data

features (appearing in a large fraction of data). In contrast, standard
training can only learn the common features but fails to learn the rare
features, thus suffering from bad generalization performance. Moreover, our
theoretical analysis also shows that the benefits of Mixup for feature learning
are mostly gained in the early training phase, based on which we propose to
apply early stopping in Mixup. Experimental results verify our theoretical
findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the early-stopped Mixup training.

available techniques to measure the DOS, KPFM is exceptional as it enables
precise local electronic investigations combined with microscopic imaging.
However, a model to interpret KPFM spectroscopy data on amorphous

provide an analytical solution to the Poisson's equation for a

solution enables us to fit experimental data for semiconductors with finite

  Weakly-supervised Pathology Whole Slide Image Classification","Accepted to CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has shown promising results in digital
Pathology Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, such a paradigm still faces
performance and generalization problems due to challenges in high computational
costs on Gigapixel WSIs and limited sample size for model training. To deal
with the computation problem, most MIL methods utilize a frozen pretrained
model from ImageNet to obtain representations first. This process may lose
essential information owing to the large domain gap and hinder the
generalization of model due to the lack of image-level training-time
augmentations. Though Self-supervised Learning (SSL) proposes viable
representation learning schemes, the improvement of the downstream task still
needs to be further explored in the conversion from the task-agnostic features
of SSL to the task-specifics under the partial label supervised learning. To
alleviate the dilemma of computation cost and performance, we propose an
efficient WSI fine-tuning framework motivated by the Information Bottleneck
theory. The theory enables the framework to find the minimal sufficient
statistics of WSI, thus supporting us to fine-tune the backbone into a
task-specific representation only depending on WSI-level weak labels. The
WSI-MIL problem is further analyzed to theoretically deduce our fine-tuning
method. Our framework is evaluated on five pathology WSI datasets on various
WSI heads. The experimental results of our fine-tuned representations show
significant improvements in both accuracy and generalization compared with
previous works. Source code will be available at

optimize the usage of available resources by minimizing the carbon footprint
while benefiting all stakeholders. The proposed architecture consists of three
layers of agents, each pursuing different objectives. The first layer,
comprised of prosumers and consumers, minimizes the total energy cost. The
other two layers control the energy price to decrease the carbon impact while
balancing the consumption and production of both renewable and conventional

ignored during the model development process. This study evaluated the
generalizability of BERT-based clinical NLP models across different clinical
settings through a breast cancer phenotype extraction task.
  Materials and Methods: Two clinical corpora of breast cancer patients were
collected from the electronic health records from the University of Minnesota
and the Mayo Clinic, and annotated following the same guideline. We developed
three types of NLP models (i.e., conditional random field, bi-directional long
short-term memory and CancerBERT) to extract cancer phenotypes from clinical
texts. The models were evaluated for their generalizability on different test
sets with different learning strategies (model transfer vs. locally trained).
The entity coverage score was assessed with their association with the model
performances.
  Results: We manually annotated 200 and 161 clinical documents at UMN and MC,
respectively. The corpora of the two institutes were found to have higher
similarity between the target entities than the overall corpora. The CancerBERT
models obtained the best performances among the independent test sets from two
clinical institutes and the permutation test set. The CancerBERT model
developed in one institute and further fine-tuned in another institute achieved
reasonable performance compared to the model developed on local data (micro-F1:
0.925 vs 0.932).
  Conclusions: The results indicate the CancerBERT model has the best learning
ability and generalizability among the three types of clinical NLP models. The
generalizability of the models was found to be correlated with the similarity
of the target entities between the corpora.

capability of reversing anomalies, i.e., preserving healthy tissue and
replacing anomalous regions with pseudo-healthy (PH) reconstructions. Unlike
recent diffusion models, our method does not rely on a learned noise

Instead, we use latent generative networks to create masks around possible

utilizes the semantic embeddings of class labels to model the co-occurrence

forward or grasping an object, but may also correspond to communicative acts,
such as asking a question to the human user. In this position paper, we reflect
on the organization of those decision modules in human-robot interaction
platforms. We discuss the relative benefits and limitations of modular vs.
end-to-end architectures, and argue that, despite the increasing popularity of
end-to-end approaches, modular architectures remain preferable when developing
conversational robots designed to execute complex tasks in collaboration with
human users. We also show that most practical HRI architectures tend to be
either robot-centric or dialogue-centric, depending on where developers wish to
place the ``command center'' of their system. While those design choices may be
justified in some application domains, they also limit the robot's ability to
flexibly interleave physical movements and conversational behaviours. We
contend that architectures placing ``action managers'' and ``interaction

the cyclic behaviour. Here we report new X-ray flux and S_MWO measurements and
also include S_MWO measurements from the historical Mount Wilson program. This
results in an observational time baseline of over 50 years for the S_MWO data

(IRT) index measurements (S_IRT) from 2013-2022 in our study. With the extended
X-ray data set, we can now detect the short cycle for the first time using a
periodogram analysis. Near-simultaneous S_MWO data and X-ray fluxes, which are
offset by 20 days at most, are moderately strongly correlated when only the
lowest activity state (concerning short-term variability) is considered in both
diagnostics. In the S_MWO data, we find strong evidence for a much longer cycle

$12$-year cycle in addition to the known 3-year cycle. The superposition of the
three periods naturally explains the recent drop in S_MWO measurements. The two
shorter cycles are also detected in the S_IRT data, although the activity
cycles exhibit lower amplitudes in the S_IRT than in the S_MWO data. Finally,
the rotation period of $\epsilon$Eri can be found more frequently in the S_MWO
as well as in the S_IRT data for times near the minimum of the long cycle. This
may be explained by a scenario in which the filling factor for magnetically
active regions near cycle maximum is too high to allow for notable short-term
variations.

Computed Tomography (CT) image analysis. Traditional deep learning frameworks
encounter compatibility issues due to variations in slice numbers and
resolutions in CT images, which stem from the use of different machines.
Commonly, individual slices are predicted and subsequently merged to obtain the
final result; however, this approach lacks slice-wise feature learning and
consequently results in decreased performance. We propose a novel slice
selection method for each CT dataset to address this limitation, effectively
filtering out uncertain slices and enhancing the model's performance.
Furthermore, we introduce a spatial-slice feature learning (SSFL)
technique\cite{hsu2022} that employs a conventional and efficient backbone
model for slice feature training, followed by extracting one-dimensional data
from the trained model for COVID and non-COVID classification using a dedicated
classification model. Leveraging these experimental steps, we integrate
one-dimensional features with multiple slices for channel merging and employ a
2D convolutional neural network (CNN) model for classification. In addition to
the aforementioned methods, we explore various high-performance classification
models, ultimately achieving promising results.

essential role in the biodiversity, stability of the ecosystem and crop

pollinators are common worldwide in past decades. Excessive use of chemical
pesticides is one of the most important threat to pollination in the current
era of anthropogenic changes. Pesticides are applied to the plants to increase
their growth by killing harmful pests and pollinators accumulates toxic
pesticides from the interacting plants directly from the nectar and pollen.
This has a significant adverse effect on the pollinator growth and the
mutualism which in turn can cause an abrupt collapse of the community however
predicting the fate of such community dynamics remains a blur under the
alarming rise in the dependency of chemical pesticides. We mathematically
modeled the influence of pesticides in a multispecies mutualistic community and
used 105 real plant-pollinator networks sampled worldwide as well as simulated
networks, to assess its detrimental effect on the plant-pollinator mutualistic
networks. Our results indicate that the persistence of the community is
strongly influenced by the level of pesticide and catastrophic and irreversible
community collapse may occur due to pesticide. Furthermore, a species rich,
highly nested community with low connectance and modularity has greater
potential to function under the influence of pesticide. We finally proposed a
realistic intervention strategy which involves the management of the pesticide
level of one targeted plant from the community. We show that our intervention
strategy can significantly delay the collapse of the community. Overall our
study can be considered as the first attempt to understand the consequences of
the chemical pesticide on a plant-pollinator mutualistic community.

opponent curves even if the task is done by trivial (identity) artificial

emerge in artificial networks as long as (i) the retina converts the input
radiation into any tristimulus-like representation, and (ii) the post-retinal
network solves the standard hue cancellation task, e.g. the network looks for
the weights of the cancelling lights so that every monochromatic stimulus plus
the weighted cancelling lights match a grey reference in the (arbitrary) color
representation used by the network. In fact, the specific cancellation lights
(and not the network architecture) are key to obtain human-like curves: results
show that the classical choice of the lights is the one that leads to the best
(more human-like) result, and any other choices lead to progressively different
spectral sensitivities. We show this in two ways: through artificial
psychophysics using a range of networks with different architectures and a
range of cancellation lights, and through a change-of-basis theoretical analogy
of the experiments. This suggests that the opponent curves of the classical
experiment are just a by-product of the front-end photoreceptors and of a very
specific experimental choice but they do not inform about the downstream color
representation. In fact, the architecture of the post-retinal network (signal
recombination or internal color space) seems irrelevant for the emergence of
the curves in the classical experiment. This result in artificial networks
questions the conventional interpretation of the classical result in humans by
Jameson and Hurvich.

differentiated planetesimals. They are thought to originate from mantles and

individual V-type asteroids and multiple planetesimals is challenging,
especially in the inner part of the main asteroid belt, where the majority of
V-type asteroids are expected to have originated from a single planetesimal,
namely, (4) Vesta.
  In this work, we aim to trace the origin of a number of individual V-type
asteroids from the inner part of the main asteroid belt. The main goal is to
identify asteroids that may not be traced back to (4) Vesta and may therefore
originate from other differentiated planetesimals.
  We performed a 2 Gy backward numerical integration of the orbits of the
selected V-type asteroids. For each asteroid, we used 1001 clones to map the
effect of orbital uncertainties. In the integration, we use information on
physical properties of the considered V-type asteroids such as pole
orientation, rotational period, and thermal parameters.
  The majority of V-types in the inner main belt outside the Vesta family are
clearly Vesta fugitives. Two objects, namely, (3307) Athabasca and (17028) 1999
FJ$_{5}$, show no clear dynamical link to (4) Vesta. Together with (809) Lundia

anomalous HED meteorites such as the Banbura Rockhole. Furthermore, some
objects of the low-inclination population cannot be traced back to (4) Vesta

  Detection under Incomplete Feature Information",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The function call graph (FCG) based Android malware detection methods have
recently attracted increasing attention due to their promising performance.
However, these methods are susceptible to adversarial examples (AEs). In this
paper, we design a novel black-box AE attack towards the FCG based malware
detection system, called BagAmmo. To mislead its target system, BagAmmo
purposefully perturbs the FCG feature of malware through inserting
""never-executed"" function calls into malware code. The main challenges are
two-fold. First, the malware functionality should not be changed by adversarial
perturbation. Second, the information of the target system (e.g., the graph
feature granularity and the output probabilities) is absent.
  To preserve malware functionality, BagAmmo employs the try-catch trap to
insert function calls to perturb the FCG of malware. Without the knowledge
about feature granularity and output probabilities, BagAmmo adopts the
architecture of generative adversarial network (GAN), and leverages a
multi-population co-evolution algorithm (i.e., Apoem) to generate the desired
perturbation. Every population in Apoem represents a possible feature
granularity, and the real feature granularity can be achieved when Apoem
converges.
  Through extensive experiments on over 44k Android apps and 32 target models,
we evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency and resilience of BagAmmo. BagAmmo
achieves an average attack success rate of over 99.9% on MaMaDroid, APIGraph
and GCN, and still performs well in the scenario of concept drift and data
imbalance. Moreover, BagAmmo outperforms the state-of-the-art attack SRL in
attack success rate.

at the census level to accurately predict population change. The effectiveness
of the proposed method is demonstrated in Kigali, Rwanda, for the time period

novel framework for fair off-policy learning: we learn decision rules from
observational data under different notions of fairness, where we explicitly
assume that observational data were collected under a different -- potentially
biased -- behavioral policy. For this, we first formalize different fairness
notions for off-policy learning. We then propose a machine learning approach to
learn optimal policies under these fairness notions. Specifically, we
reformulate the fairness notions into unconstrained learning objectives that
can be estimated from finite samples. Here, we leverage machine learning to
minimize the objective constrained on a fair representation of the data, so
that the resulting policies satisfy our fairness notions. We further provide
theoretical guarantees in form of generalization bounds for the finite-sample

of which are presumed fully convective; the addition of newer ASAS-SN data
confirms cycles in roughly a dozen of them, while presenting new or revised
rotation periods for five. The amplitudes and periods of these cycles follow
$A_{\rm cyc} \propto P_{\rm cyc}^{0.94 \pm 0.11}$, with $P_{\rm cyc}/P_{\rm

different $P_{\rm cyc}/P_{\rm rot}$-Ro relationship seen here compared to
previous work suggests that two types of dynamo, with opposite Ro dependences,
operate in cool stars. Initially, a (likely $\alpha^2$ or $\alpha^2\Omega$)
dynamo operates throughout the convective zone in mid-late M and fast rotating
FGK stars, but once magnetic breaking decouples the core and convective
envelope, a tachocline $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo begins and eventually dominates in
older FGK stars. A change in $\alpha$ in the tachocline dynamo generates the
fundamentally different $P_{\rm cyc}/P_{\rm rot}$-Ro relationship.

solve this task efficiently when facing high-resolution images due to two
reasons: (1) Large reception field needs to be handled for high-resolution
image inpainting. (2) The general encoder and decoder network synthesizes many
background pixels synchronously due to the form of the image matrix. In this
paper, we try to break the above limitations for the first time thanks to the
recent development of continuous implicit representation. In detail, we
down-sample and encode the degraded image to produce the spatial-adaptive
parameters for each spatial patch via an attentional Fast Fourier
Convolution(FFC)-based parameter generation network. Then, we take these
parameters as the weights and biases of a series of multi-layer
perceptron(MLP), where the input is the encoded continuous coordinates and the
output is the synthesized color value. Thanks to the proposed structure, we
only encode the high-resolution image in a relatively low resolution for larger
reception field capturing. Then, the continuous position encoding will be
helpful to synthesize the photo-realistic high-frequency textures by
re-sampling the coordinate in a higher resolution. Also, our framework enables
us to query the coordinates of missing pixels only in parallel, yielding a more
efficient solution than the previous methods. Experiments show that the

representation capabilities while suffering from their high computational
costs. In this paper, inspired by the human visual cognitive process, i.e.,
human being's perception of a visual scene is always accomplished by multiple
stages of analysis, we propose a novel multi-stage recurrent generative
adversarial networks for ODIs dubbed MRGAN360, to predict the saliency maps
stage by stage. At each stage, the prediction model takes as input the original

map. We employ a recurrent neural network among adjacent prediction stages to
model their correlations, and exploit a discriminator at the end of each stage
to supervise the output saliency map. In addition, we share the weights among
all the stages to obtain a lightweight architecture that is computationally
cheap. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our proposed

to assemble available information into an informative prior. Challenges arise
as prior information is often only available for the observable quantity, or
some model-derived marginal quantity, rather than directly pertaining to the
natural parameters in our model. We propose a method for translating available
prior information, in the form of an elicited distribution for the observable
or model-derived marginal quantity, into an informative joint prior. Our
approach proceeds given a parametric class of prior distributions with as yet
undetermined hyperparameters, and minimises the difference between the supplied
elicited distribution and corresponding prior predictive distribution. We
employ a global, multi-stage Bayesian optimisation procedure to locate optimal
values for the hyperparameters. Three examples illustrate our approach: a
nonlinear regression model; a setting in which prior information pertains to
$R^{2}$ -- a model-derived quantity; and a cure-fraction survival model, where
censoring implies that the observable quantity is a priori a mixed
discrete/continuous quantity.

to noise-induced resonance phenomena such as coherence resonance (CR), and
adaptive rules in neural networks have been mostly linked to two prevalent
mechanisms: spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic structural
plasticity (HSP). Thus, this paper investigates CR in small-world and random
adaptive networks of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons driven by STDP and HSP. Our
numerical study indicates that the degree of CR strongly depends, and in
different ways, on the adjusting rate parameter $P$, which controls STDP, on
the characteristic rewiring frequency parameter $F$, which controls HSP, and on
the parameters of the network topology. In particular, we found two robust
behaviors: (i) Decreasing $P$ (which enhances the weakening effect of STDP on
synaptic weights) and decreasing $F$ (which slows down the swapping rate of
synapses between neurons) always leads to higher degrees of CR in small-world
and random networks, provided that the synaptic time delay parameter $\tau_c$
has some appropriate values. (ii) Increasing the synaptic time delay $\tau_c$
induces multiple CR (MCR) -- the occurrence of multiple peaks in the degree of
coherence as $\tau_c$ changes -- in small-world and random networks, with MCR
becoming more pronounced at smaller values of $P$ and $F$. Our results imply
that STDP and HSP can jointly play an essential role in enhancing the time
precision of firing necessary for optimal information processing and transfer
in neural systems and could thus have applications in designing networks of
noisy artificial neural circuits engineered to use CR to optimize information
processing and transfer.

of gauge couplings within closed string theories. Unlike previous discussions
in the literature, our calculations fully respect the underlying modular
invariance of the string and include the contributions from the infinite towers
of string states which are ultimately responsible for many of the properties
for which string theory is famous, including an enhanced degree of finiteness
and UV/IR mixing. In order to perform our calculations, we adopt a formalism
that was recently developed for calculations of the Higgs mass within such
theories, and demonstrate that this formalism can also be applied to
calculations of gauge couplings. In general, this formalism gives rise to an
``on-shell'' effective field theory (EFT) description in which the final
results are expressed in terms of supertraces over the physical string states,
and in which these quantities exhibit an EFT-like ``running'' as a function of
an effective spacetime mass scale. We find, however, that the calculation of
the gauge couplings differs in one deep way from that of the Higgs mass: while
the latter results depend on purely on-shell supertraces, the former results
have a different modular structure which causes them to depend on off-shell
supertraces as well. In some regions of parameter space, our results
demonstrate how certain expected field-theoretic behaviors can emerge from the
highly UV/IR-mixed environment. In other situations, by contrast, our results
give rise to a number of intrinsically stringy behaviors that transcend what
might be expected within an effective field theory approach.

jump length comparable to the size of the box, the number of relaxation
eigenmodes can be surprisingly small, one or two. We provide a complete
analytic description of the transition between these two regimes. When only a
single relaxation eigenmode is present, a suitable choice of the symmetry of
the initial conditions gives a localizing decay to equilibrium. In this case,
the deviation from equilibrium concentrates at the edges of the box where the
rejection probability is maximal. Finally, in addition to the relaxation

input corruption situations where audio inputs and visual inputs are both
corrupted, which is not well addressed in previous research directions.
Previous studies have focused on how to complement the corrupted audio inputs
with the clean visual inputs with the assumption of the availability of clean
visual inputs. However, in real life, clean visual inputs are not always
accessible and can even be corrupted by occluded lip regions or noises. Thus,
we firstly analyze that the previous AVSR models are not indeed robust to the
corruption of multimodal input streams, the audio and the visual inputs,
compared to uni-modal models. Then, we design multimodal input corruption
modeling to develop robust AVSR models. Lastly, we propose a novel AVSR
framework, namely Audio-Visual Reliability Scoring module (AV-RelScore), that
is robust to the corrupted multimodal inputs. The AV-RelScore can determine
which input modal stream is reliable or not for the prediction and also can
exploit the more reliable streams in prediction. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is evaluated with comprehensive experiments on popular
benchmark databases, LRS2 and LRS3. We also show that the reliability scores
obtained by AV-RelScore well reflect the degree of corruption and make the
proposed model focus on the reliable multimodal representations.

approaches to formulate the control problem as large nonlinear optimization
problems. The optimization problems are challenging to solve due to their size,
especially if the control problems include time-varying uncertainty. This paper
draws from local reduction methods used in semi-infinite optimization to solve
robust optimal control problems with parametric and time-varying uncertainty.
By iteratively adding interim worst-case scenarios to the problem, methods
based on local reduction provide a way to manage the total number of scenarios.
We show that the local reduction method for optimal control problems consists
of solving a series of simplified optimal control problems to find worst-case
constraint violations. In particular, we present examples where local reduction
methods find worst-case scenarios that are not on the boundary of the
uncertainty set. We also provide bounds on the error if local solvers are used.
The proposed approach is illustrated with two case studies with parametric and
additive time-varying uncertainty. In the first case study, the number of
scenarios obtained from local reduction is 101, smaller than in the case when
all $2^{14+3\times192}$ extreme scenarios are considered. In the second case
study, the number of scenarios obtained from the local reduction is two
compared to 512 extreme scenarios. Our approach was able to satisfy the
constraints both for parametric uncertainty and time-varying disturbances,
whereas approaches from literature either violated the constraints or became
computationally expensive.

which limits the achievable performance. In this paper, to tackle this issue, a
knowledge graph is exploited to develop semantic communication systems. Two
cognitive semantic communication frameworks are proposed for the single-user

interpretable semantic alignment algorithm for semantic information detection
is proposed. Furthermore, an effective semantic correction algorithm is
proposed by mining the inference rule from the knowledge graph. Additionally,
the pre-trained model is fine-tuned to recover semantic information. For the
multi-user cognitive semantic communication system, a message recovery
algorithm is proposed to distinguish messages of different users by matching
the knowledge level between the source and the destination. Extensive
simulation results conducted on a public dataset demonstrate that our proposed
single-user and multi-user cognitive semantic communication systems are
superior to benchmark communication systems in terms of the data compression
rate and communication reliability. Finally, we present realistic single-user

together with the polarization squeezing of the probe pulses, a significant
squeezing of atomic spins also occurs simultaneously. The results of the
simultaneous squeezing of light polarizations and atomic spins by using only a

For general Bregman projections, our method is a stochastic mirror descent with
a novel adaptive step size. We prove that in the convex setting each iteration

compared to the standard Polyak step. Our generalization to Bregman projections
comes with the price that a convex one-dimensional optimization problem needs
to be solved in each iteration. This can typically be done with globalized
Newton iterations. Convergence is proved in two classical settings of
nonlinearity: for convex nonnegative functions and locally for functions which
fulfill the tangential cone condition. Finally, we show examples in which the

(1984) of regular expressions modulo bisimilarity have turned out to be
difficult for the full class of expressions with deadlock 0 and empty step~1.
We report on a phenomenon that arises from the added presence of 1 when 0 is
available, and that brings a crucial reason for this difficulty into focus. To
wit, while interpretations of 1-free regular expressions are closed under
bisimulation collapse, this is not the case for the interpretations of
arbitrary regular expressions.
  Process graph interpretations of 1-free regular expressions satisfy the loop
existence and elimination property LEE, which is preserved under bisimulation
collapse. These features of LEE were applied for showing that an equational
proof system for 1-free regular expressions modulo bisimilarity is complete,
and that it is decidable in polynomial time whether a process graph is
bisimilar to the interpretation of a 1-free regular expression.
  While interpretations of regular expressions do not satisfy the property LEE
in general, we show that LEE can be recovered by refined interpretations as
graphs with 1-transitions refined interpretations with 1-transitions (which are
similar to silent steps for automata). This suggests that LEE can be expedient
also for the general axiomatization and expressibility problems. But a new
phenomenon emerges that needs to be addressed: the property of a process graph
`to can be refined into a process graph with 1-transitions and with LEE' is not
preserved under bisimulation collapse. We provide a 10-vertex graph with two
1-transitions that satisfies LEE, and in which a pair of bisimilar vertices
cannot be collapsed on to each other while preserving the refinement property.
This implies that the image of the process interpretation of regular
expressions is not closed under bisimulation collapse.

phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid bilayers can be increased by two orders of
magnitude or more via an externally-applied electric field, and that this
increase is fully reversible when the field is switched off. While this
striking effect holds promising application potential, its molecular origin
remains unknown due to difficulty in experimentally probing confined membrane
structure at a molecular level. Our earlier molecular dynamics simulations
revealed the equilibrium electroporated structure of such confined lipid
membranes under an electric field; here we extend this approach to study the
associated sliding friction between two solid surfaces across such PC bilayers.
We identify the enhanced friction in the field as arising from membrane
undulations due to the electroporation; this leads to some dehydration at the
lipid-water interfaces, leading to closer contact and thus increased attraction
between the zwitterionic headgroups, which results in increased frictional
dissipation between the bilayers as they slide past each other. Additionally,
the electric field facilitates formation of lipid bridges spanning the
intersurface gap; at the sliding velocities of the experiments, these bridges
increase the friction by topologically-forcing the slip-plane to pass through
the acyl tail-tail interface, associated with higher dissipation during
sliding. Our results account quantitatively for the experimentally-observed
electro-modulated friction with boundary lipid bilayers, and indicate more
generally how they may affect interactions between contacting surfaces, where
high local transverse fields may be ubiquitous.

the least amount of latency possible. As a result of these decisions, the stage
of infestation, the crops affected, the method of prevention of spreading the
disease, and what type and amount of pesticides need to be applied can be
determined. UAVs equipped with sensors detect disease patterns quickly and
accurately over large areas. Combined with AI algorithms, these machines can
analyse data from a variety of sources such as temperature, humidity, CO2
levels and soil composition. This allows them to recognize disease symptoms
before they become visible. Early detection allows for more effective control
strategies that can reduce costs caused by lost production due to infestations

for full fine-tuning so as to adapt pre-trained vision models to downstream
tasks, which only tunes a small number of parameters while freezing the vast
majority ones to ease storage burden and optimization difficulty. However,
existing VPET methods introduce trainable parameters to the same positions
across different tasks depending solely on human heuristics and neglect the
domain gaps. To this end, we study where to introduce and how to allocate
trainable parameters by proposing a novel Sensitivity-aware visual
Parameter-efficient Tuning (SPT) scheme, which adaptively allocates trainable
parameters to task-specific important positions given a desired tunable
parameter budget. Specifically, our SPT first quickly identifies the sensitive
parameters that require tuning for a given task in a data-dependent way. Next,
our SPT further boosts the representational capability for the weight matrices
whose number of sensitive parameters exceeds a pre-defined threshold by
utilizing any of the existing structured tuning methods, e.g., LoRA or Adapter,
to replace directly tuning the selected sensitive parameters (unstructured
tuning) under the budget. Extensive experiments on a wide range of downstream
recognition tasks show that our SPT is complementary to the existing VPET
methods and largely boosts their performance, e.g., SPT improves Adapter with
supervised pre-trained ViT-B/16 backbone by 4.2% and 1.4% mean Top-1 accuracy,
reaching SOTA performance on FGVC and VTAB-1k benchmarks, respectively. Source

describe the non-linear viscoelastic behavior in a complex wet-spinning process

connected with key mechanical properties of fully-regenerated fibers, thus

paper aims to consider the observation problem of periodic systems by bridging
two fundamental filtering algorithms for periodic systems with a sensor
network: consensus-on-measurement-based distributed filtering (CMDF) and
centralized Kalman filtering (CKF). Firstly, one mild convergence condition
based on uniformly collective observability is established for CMDF, under
which the filtering performance of CMDF can be formulated as a symmetric
periodic positive semidefinite (SPPS) solution to a discrete-time periodic
Lyapunov equation. Then, the closed form of the performance gap between CMDF
and CKF is presented in terms of the information fusion steps and the consensus
weights of the network. Moreover, it is pointed out that the estimation error
covariance of CMDF exponentially converges to the centralized one with the
fusion steps tending to infinity. Altogether, these new results establish a
concise and specific relationship between distributed and centralized
filterings, and formulate the trade-off between the communication cost and
distributed filtering performance on periodic systems. Finally, the theoretical
results are verified with numerical experiments.

compound crystalizes in disordered Type-2 structure (space group: Fm-3m) in

the compound orders ferromagnetically below TC ~ 293 K and the saturation

keys, which are tuples of input values, to payloads, which are elements from a

displays a rich phase diagram. In this work we focus on the plane wave phase

density of the particle changes from uniform to periodically modulated.
Basically, this stripe is described by a sine function and the wave length, the
amplitude and the initial phase of the function are all varying with time. If
the system stays in stripe phase initially, the stripes become ``sliding"" when

GIFAD patterns for the He-LiF(001) system at room temperature. The P0-SIVR
approach is a semiquantum method that describes the zero-phonon atom-surface
scattering including the contribution of intermediate phonon transitions. The
main features introduced by thermal lattice vibrations in the angular
distributions of the scattered helium atoms are investigated by considering
normal energies in the 0.1 -3 eV range. In all the cases, thermal fluctuations
introduce a wide polar spread that transforms the interference maxima into
elongated strips. We found that the polar width of these fringes does not
depend on the normal energy, as it was experimentally observed. In addition,
when the normal energy increases, not only the relative intensities of
interference peaks are affected by the crystal vibrations, but also the
visibility of the interference structures, which disappear completely for
normal energies approximately equal to or higher than 3 eV. These findings
agree fairly well with the experimental data reported in Phys. Chem. Chem.
Phys. 237615 (2021). However, it should be noticed that the simulated polar
widths underestimate the experimentally-derived limit, suggesting that there
are other mechanisms, such as inelastic phonon processes, that contribute to
the polar dispersion of the GIFAD patterns.

advantage in sensitivity for all equatorial rotation axes (and hence
non-commuting rotations) over the classical bound is shown in terms of
quadratic scaling of the quantum Fisher information. Our results provide a
method for measuring magnetic fields in any direction in the $x$-$y$-plane with
the same optimized initial state.

charges in solids whose general microscopic descriptions are yet to be
completed. Layered kagome metals of $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs) provide a
unique chance to realize its emergence intertwined with dimensional effects as
well as their special lattice. Here, based on a state-of-the-art molecular
dynamics simulation, we uncover that the phase transition to charge ordered
states in kagome metals is a condensation process of incoherently preformed
CDWs. We demonstrate that charge modulation first preforms on each kagome layer
at a well defined temperature but its phase fluctuation proliferates across the
entire layers with a $10^5$ times slower frequency than typical phonon
vibrations until reaching its freezing temperature. We find that the
fluctuation is not random but confined to a limited number of states as a
consequence of unavoidable degeneracy in stacking layered charge orders. As the
size of interfacial alkali atom increases, the fluctuating phases are shown to
counterbalance the condensation of orderings, resulting in a maximized
transition temperature for RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Our results resolve several
controversial observations on their CDW formations and highlight a crucial role
of interlayer interactions for the charge ordering in kagome metals.

We propose RICO to address this by regularizing the unobservable regions for

smoothness of the occluded background, which then in turn guides the foreground
object reconstruction in unobservable regions based on the object-background
relationship. Particularly, we regularize the geometry smoothness of occluded
background patches. With the improved background surface, the signed distance

them within the background range. Extensive experiments show our method

axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$) is well known to have $n^{\frac{d}{2}\pm
o(1)}$-time algorithms (Overmars, Yap, SICOMP'91; Chan FOCS'13). Only recently,
a conditional lower bound (without any restriction to ``combinatorial''
algorithms) could be shown for $d=3$ (K\""unnemann, FOCS'22). Can this result be
extended to a tight lower bound for dimensions $d\ge 4$?
  In this paper, we formalize the technique of the tight lower bound for $d=3$
using a combinatorial object we call prefix covering design. We show that these
designs, which are related in spirit to combinatorial designs, directly
translate to conditional lower bounds for Klee's measure problem and various
related problems. By devising good prefix covering designs, we give the
following lower bounds for Klee's measure problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the depth
problem for axis-parallel boxes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, the
largest-volume/max-perimeter empty (anchored) box problem in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$,
and related problems:
  - $\Omega(n^{1.90476})$ for $d=4$,
  - $\Omega(n^{2.22222})$ for $d=5$,
  - $\Omega(n^{d/3 + 2\sqrt{d}/9-o(\sqrt{d})})$ for general $d$,
  assuming the 3-uniform hyperclique hypothesis. For Klee's measure problem and
the depth problem, these bounds improve previous lower bounds of
$\Omega(n^{1.777...}), \Omega(n^{2.0833...})$ and $\Omega(n^{d/3 + 1/3 +
\Theta(1/d)})$ respectively.
  Our improved prefix covering designs were obtained by (1) exploiting a
computer-aided search using problem-specific insights as well as SAT solvers,
and (2) showing how to transform combinatorial covering designs known in the
literature to strong prefix covering designs. In contrast, we show that our
lower bounds are close to best possible using this proof technique.

by a non-additive entropy. Due to their versatility and practicality,
$q$-Gaussians are a natural choice for modeling input quantities in measurement
models. This paper presents the characteristic function of a linear combination
of independent $q$-Gaussian random variables and proposes a numerical method
for its inversion. The proposed technique makes it possible to determine the

to consider and count training examples inside and outside each rectangle. It
is proposed to incorporate HRBMs into the gradient boosting machine (GBM).
Despite simplicity of HRBMs, it turns out that these simple base models allow
us to construct effective ensemble-based models and avoid overfitting. A simple
method for calculating optimal regularization parameters of the ensemble-based
model, which can be modified in the explicit way at each iteration of GBM, is

by using the well-known method SHAP is proposed. It is shown that GBM with HRBM
can be regarded as a model extending a set of interpretable models for
explaining black-box models. Numerical experiments with real datasets
illustrate the proposed GBM with HRBMs for regression and classification
problems. Experiments also illustrate computational efficiency of the proposed
SHAP modifications. The code of proposed algorithms implementing GBM with HRBM

effectively reproduce most morphological features in galaxy images. To further
validate the effectiveness of our approach, we utilised a classical random
forest (RF) classifier on the 40-dimensional latent variables to make detailed
morphology feature classifications. This approach performs similarly to a
direct neural network application on galaxy images. We further enhance our
model by tuning the VAE network via DA using galaxies in the overlapping
footprint of DECaLS and BASS+MzLS, enabling the unbiased application of our
model to galaxy images in both surveys. We observed that noise suppression
during DA led to even better morphological feature extraction and
classification performance. Overall, this combination of VAE and DA can be
applied to achieve image dimensionality reduction, defect image identification,
and morphology classification in large optical surveys.

balance mechanism between the damping and source terms. When the damping
exponent $(p+1)$ (see assumption (H3)) is greater than the source term exponent

microscopic physics governing its structural and heat-transport properties is
of key relevance for e.g. the design of heat management in these devices. Here
we rely on first-principles techniques to characterize the structural,
vibrational, and thermal properties of amorphous alumina across a wide range of
densities, ranging from the record-low value of 2.28 g/cm^3 to the record-high
value of 3.49 g/cm^3. We show that the large variety of atomic coordination
topologies coexisting in this material are responsible for the emergence of
significant structural disorder at the sub-nanometer length scale. We apply the
recently developed Wigner formulation of thermal transport in solids to
characterize how the interplay between such strong topological disorder and
anharmonicity affects heat transport, showing that topological disorder
dominates over anharmonicity in determining the thermal conductivity of
amorphous alumina.

directly refine the low-resolution high-level feature map is a common practice
of low-resolution feature map upsampling. However, the representation power of
the low-level features is generally worse than high-level features, thus

Specifically, the guidance is realized through carefully designed stop gradient
operations and class kernels. Now the class kernels co-evolve only with the
high-level features and are reused in the upsampling head to guide the training
process of the upsampling head. HFGD is very efficient and effective that can
also upsample the feature maps to a previously unseen output stride (OS) of 2

passively degrade a single energy layer using a patient-specific range
modulator. We propose an innovative method to directly optimize the geometrical
characteristics of the range modulator and the treatment plan with respect to
user defined constraints, similarly to state-of-the-art IMPT inverse planning.
  Methods: The kind of range modulators proposed in this study is a voxelized
object which can be placed in the CT for dose computation, which simplifies the
simulation pipeline. Both the geometrical characteristics of the range
modulator and the weights of the PBS spots were directly optimized with respect
to constraints on the dose using a first-order method. A modified Monte Carlo
dose engine was used to provide an estimate of the gradient of the relaxed
constraints with respect to the elevation values of the range modulator.
  Results: Assessed on a head and neck case, dose conformity logically appeared
to be significantly degraded compared to IMPT. We then demonstrated that this
degradation came mainly from the use of a large range shifter and therefore
from physical limitations inherent in the passive degradation of beam energy.
The geometry of the range modulator, on the other hand, was shown to be very
close to being optimal. PBS dose rates were computed and discussed with respect
to FLASH objectives.
  Conclusions: The voxelized range modulators optimized with the proposed
method were proven to be optimal on a head and neck case characterized by two
rather large volumes, with irregular contours and variable depths. The
optimized geometry differed from conventional ridge filters as it was
arbitrarily set by the optimizer. This kind of range modulators can be directly
added in the CT for dose computation and is well suited for 3D printing.

describes some aspects of eukaryotic cell migration. Generic polarity markers
located in the cell are transported by actin which they help to polymerize.
This leads to a problem whose mathematical novelty is the nonlinear and
nonlocal destabilizing term in the boundary condition.
  We provide a detailed study of the qualitative properties of this model,
namely local and global existence, convergence and blow-up of solutions. We
start with a complete analysis of local existence-uniqueness in Lebesgue
spaces. This turns out to be particularly relevant, in view of the mass
conservation property and of the existence of $L^p$ Liapunov functionals, also
obtained in this paper.
  With the help of this local theory, we next study the global existence and
convergence of solutions. In particular, in the case of quadratic nonlinearity,
for any space dimension, we find an explicit, sharp mass threshold for global
existence vs.~finite time blow-up of solutions. The proof is delicate, based on
the possiblity to control the solution by means of the entropy function via an
$\eps$-regularity type argument. This critical mass phenomenon is somehow
reminiscent of the well-known situation for the $2d$ Keller-Segel system. For
nonlinearitities with general power growth, under a suitable smallness
condition on the initial data, we show that solutions exist globally and
converge exponentially to a constant.
  As for the possibility of blow-up for large initial data, it turns out to
occur only for nonlinearities with quadratic or superquadratic growth, whereas
all solutions are shown to be global and bounded in the subquadratic case, thus
revealing the existence of a sharp critical exponent for blow-up. Finally, we
analyse some aspects of the blow-up asymptotics of solutions in time and space.

of source-target differences on both the skeleton and shape geometry levels. In
this work, we propose a novel Residual RETargeting network (R2ET) structure,
which relies on two neural modification modules, to adjust the source motions
to fit the target skeletons and shapes progressively. In particular, a
skeleton-aware module is introduced to preserve the source motion semantics. A
shape-aware module is designed to perceive the geometries of target characters
to reduce interpenetration and contact-missing. Driven by our explored
distance-based losses that explicitly model the motion semantics and geometry,
these two modules can learn residual motion modifications on the source motion
to generate plausible retargeted motion in a single inference without
post-processing. To balance these two modifications, we further present a
balancing gate to conduct linear interpolation between them. Extensive
experiments on the public dataset Mixamo demonstrate that our R2ET achieves the
state-of-the-art performance, and provides a good balance between the
preservation of motion semantics as well as the attenuation of interpenetration

shock waves evolve from the corona to the interplanetary medium can therefore
contribute to improving nowcasting and forecasting of space weather. Early
warnings from these shock waves can come from radio measurements as well as
coronagraphic observations that can be exploited to characterise the dynamical

shown that shock waves observed from multiple vantage points can be aptly
reproduced geometrically by simple ellipsoids. The catalogue of reconstructed
shock waves provides the time-dependent evolution of these ellipsoidal

particular, the transition is made of a well defined sequence of events, each
of which corresponds to either the nucleation of one (or several) cluster(s) of
synchronized nodes or to the merging of multiple synchronized clusters into a
single one. The network's nodes involved in each of such clusters can be
exactly identified, and the value of the coupling strength at which such events
are taking place (and therefore, the complete events' sequence) can be
rigorously ascertained. We moreover clarify that the synchronized clusters are
formed by those nodes which are indistinguishable at the eyes of any other
network's vertex, and as so they receive the same dynamical input from the rest
of the network. Therefore, such clusters are more general subsets of nodes than
those defined by the graph's symmetry orbits, and at the same time more
specific than those described by network's equitable partitions. Finally, we
present large scale simulations which show how accurate are our predictions in
describing the synchronization transition of both synthetic and real-world
large size networks, and we even report that the observed sequence of clusters
is preserved in heterogeneous networks made of slightly non identical systems.

provides that information to the aggregation model to help with classification
tasks. Specifically, in each round of pFedPT training, each client generates a
local personalized prompt related to local data distribution. Then, the local
model is trained on the input composed of raw data and a visual prompt to learn
the distribution information contained in the prompt. During model testing, the
aggregated model obtains prior knowledge of the data distributions based on the
prompts, which can be seen as an adaptive fine-tuning of the aggregation model
to improve model performances on different clients. Furthermore, the visual
prompt can be added as an orthogonal method to implement personalization on the
client for existing FL methods to boost their performance. Experiments on the

and singlet excited states are also studied. The relevant vibrational
parameters are computed by solving the vibrational Schr\""odinger equation.
Subsequently, the vibrational energy spacings and transition dipole moments
between the vibrational levels belonging to the same electronic states are used
to evaluate the spontaneous and black-body radiation induced transition rates,
followed by computing lifetimes. Finally, the energy differences between
rotational levels belonging to different vibrational levels and within an

  Color Filters","10 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Retouching images is an essential aspect of enhancing the visual appeal of
photos. Although users often share common aesthetic preferences, their
retouching methods may vary based on their individual preferences. Therefore,
there is a need for white-box approaches that produce satisfying results and
enable users to conveniently edit their images simultaneously. Recent white-box
retouching methods rely on cascaded global filters that provide image-level
filter arguments but cannot perform fine-grained retouching. In contrast,
colorists typically use a divide-and-conquer approach, performing a series of
region-specific fine-grained enhancements when using traditional tools like
Davinci Resolve. We draw on this insight to develop a white-box framework for
photo retouching using parallel region-specific filters, called RSFNet. Our
model generates filter arguments (e.g., saturation, contrast, hue) and
attention maps of regions for each filter simultaneously. Instead of cascading
filters, RSFNet employs linear summations of filters, allowing for a more
diverse range of filter classes that can be trained more easily. Our
experiments demonstrate that RSFNet achieves state-of-the-art results, offering
satisfying aesthetic appeal and greater user convenience for editable white-box
retouching.

In this work, we present a complete Rydberg-based architecture, co-designed to
digitally simulate the dynamics of general gauge theories coupled to matter
fields in a hardware-efficient manner. Ref. [1] showed how a qudit processor,
where non-abelian gauge fields are locally encoded and time-evolved,
considerably reduces the required simulation resources compared to standard
qubit-based quantum computers. Here we integrate the latter with a recently
introduced fermionic quantum processor [2], where fermionic statistics are
accounted for at the hardware level, allowing us to construct quantum circuits
that preserve the locality of the gauge-matter interactions. We exemplify the
flexibility of such a fermion-qudit processor by focusing on two paradigmatic
high-energy phenomena. First, we present a resource-efficient protocol to
simulate the Abelian-Higgs model, where the dynamics of confinement and string
breaking can be investigated. Then, we show how to prepare hadrons made up of
fermionic matter constituents bound by non-abelian gauge fields, and show how
to extract the corresponding hadronic tensor. In both cases, we estimate the
required resources, showing how quantum devices can be used to calculate
experimentally-relevant quantities in particle physics.

practical applications of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Several works propose to
prune redundant tokens to achieve efficient ViTs. However, these methods
generally suffer from (i) dramatic accuracy drops, (ii) application difficulty
in the local vision transformer, and (iii) non-general-purpose networks for
downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a novel Semantic Token ViT (STViT),
for efficient global and local vision transformers, which can also be revised
to serve as backbone for downstream tasks. The semantic tokens represent
cluster centers, and they are initialized by pooling image tokens in space and
recovered by attention, which can adaptively represent global or local semantic
information. Due to the cluster properties, a few semantic tokens can attain
the same effect as vast image tokens, for both global and local vision
transformers. For instance, only 16 semantic tokens on DeiT-(Tiny,Small,Base)
can achieve the same accuracy with more than 100% inference speed improvement
and nearly 60% FLOPs reduction; on Swin-(Tiny,Small,Base), we can employ 16
semantic tokens in each window to further speed it up by around 20% with slight
accuracy increase. Besides great success in image classification, we also
extend our method to video recognition. In addition, we design a
STViT-R(ecover) network to restore the detailed spatial information based on
the STViT, making it work for downstream tasks, which is powerless for previous
token sparsification methods. Experiments demonstrate that our method can
achieve competitive results compared to the original networks in object

hard to utilize the large-scale feedback data and increases the data collection
expenses. To bridge this gap, we propose a new weakly supervised monocular 3D
objection detection method, which can train the model with only 2D labels

weakly-supervised architecture based on these consistencies. Moreover, we
propose a new 2D direction labeling method in this task to guide the model for

whether the subject of study -- be it a rodent or a human -- exhibits
model-based learning is effective adaptation to local changes in the
environment. In reinforcement learning, however, recent work has shown that
modern deep model-based reinforcement-learning (MBRL) methods adapt poorly to
such changes. An explanation for this mismatch is that MBRL methods are
typically designed with sample-efficiency on a single task in mind and the
requirements for effective adaptation are substantially higher, both in terms
of the learned world model and the planning routine. One particularly
challenging requirement is that the learned world model has to be sufficiently
accurate throughout relevant parts of the state-space. This is challenging for
deep-learning-based world models due to catastrophic forgetting. And while a
replay buffer can mitigate the effects of catastrophic forgetting, the
traditional first-in-first-out replay buffer precludes effective adaptation due
to maintaining stale data. In this work, we show that a conceptually simple
variation of this traditional replay buffer is able to overcome this
limitation. By removing only samples from the buffer from the local
neighbourhood of the newly observed samples, deep world models can be built
that maintain their accuracy across the state-space, while also being able to
effectively adapt to changes in the reward function. We demonstrate this by
applying our replay-buffer variation to a deep version of the classical Dyna
method, as well as to recent methods such as PlaNet and DreamerV2,
demonstrating that deep model-based methods can adapt effectively as well to
local changes in the environment.

has shown great potential to approach High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging by
sensors with limited dynamic range. However, in the presence of large motion of
scene objects or the camera, mis-alignment is almost inevitable and leads to
the notorious ``ghost'' artifacts. Besides, factors such as the noise in the
dark region or color saturation in the over-bright region may also fail to fill
local image details to the HDR image. This paper provides a novel
multi-exposure fusion model based on Swin Transformer. Particularly, we design
feature selection gates, which are integrated with the feature extraction
layers to detect outliers and block them from HDR image synthesis. To
reconstruct the missing local details by well-aligned and properly-exposed
regions, we exploit the long distance contextual dependency in the
exposure-space pyramid by the self-attention mechanism. Extensive numerical and
visual evaluation has been conducted on a variety of benchmark datasets. The
experiments show that our model achieves the accuracy on par with current top

($E_\text{F}$) lying either in the conduction or valence bands. In the
non-interacting picture, optical absorption in gapless Dirac metals occurs only
if the frequency of incident photons ($\Omega$) exceeds the direct (Pauli)
frequency threshold, equal to $2E_\text{F}$. In this work, we study, both
analytically and numerically, the role of electron-electron ($ee$) and
electron-hole ($eh$) interactions in optical absorption of two-dimensional (2D)
and three-dimensional (3D) Dirac metals in the entire interval of frequencies
below $2E_\text{F}$. We show that, for $\Omega\ll E_\text{F}$, the optical
conductivity, $\Re\sigma(\Omega)$, arising from the combination of $ee$ and
certain $eh$ scattering processes, scales as $\Omega^2\ln\Omega$ in 2D and as
$\Omega^2$ in 3D, respectively, both for short-range (Hubbard) and long-range
(screened Coulomb) interactions. Another type of $eh$ processes, similar to
Auger-Meitner (AM) processes in atomic physics, starts to contribute for
$\Omega$ above the direct threshold, equal to $E_\text{F}$. Similar to the case
of doped semiconductors with parabolic bands studied in prior literature, the
AM contribution to $\Re\sigma(\Omega)$ in Dirac metals is manifested by a
threshold singularity, $\Re\sigma(\Omega)\propto (\Omega-E_\text{F})^{d+2}$,
where $d$ is the spatial dimensionality and $0<\Omega-E_\text{F}\ll
E_\text{F}$. In contrast to doped semiconductors, however, the AM contribution
in Dirac metals is completely overshadowed by the $ee$ and other $eh$
contributions. Numerically, $\Re\sigma(\Omega)$ happens to be small in almost
the entire range of $\Omega<2E_\text{F}$. This finding may have important
consequences for collective modes in Dirac metals lying below $2E_\text{F}$.

strongly rely on the reliability of onboard computers to guarantee the success

expensive, and developing inflexible architectural and microarchitectural
modifications to introduce modular redundancy within a system leads to
significant area increase and performance degradation as well. To mitigate the
overheads of traditional radiation hardening and modular redundancy schemes, we
present a novel Hybrid Modular Redundancy (HMR) approach that features a
cluster of RISC-V processors with a flexible on-demand dual-core and
triple-core lockstep grouping of computing cores with runtime split-lock
capabilities. Further, we propose two recovery approaches, software-based and
hardware-based, trading off performance and area overhead. Running at 430 MHz,
our fault-tolerant cluster achieves up to 1160 MOPS on a matrix multiplication
benchmark when configured in non-redundant mode and 617 and 414 MOPS in dual
and triple mode, respectively. A software-based recovery in triple mode
requires 363 clock cycles and occupies 0.612 mm2, representing a 1.3% area
overhead over a non-redundant 12-core RISC-V cluster. As a high-performance
alternative, a new hardware-based method provides rapid fault recovery in just
24 clock cycles and occupies 0.660 mm2, namely ~9.4% area overhead over the
baseline non-redundant RISC-V cluster. The cluster is also enhanced with
split-lock capabilities to enter one of the available redundant modes with
minimum performance loss, allowing execution of a safety-critical portion of
code with 310 and 23 clock cycles overhead for entry and exit, respectively.
The proposed system is the first to integrate these functionalities on an
open-source RISC-V-based compute device, enabling finely tunable reliability
vs. performance trade-offs.

theoretical models of the dense matter in the neutron stars. Usually, such
simulations were carried out assuming that the free neutrons and nuclei in the
inner crust move together. A recently proposed thermodynamically consistent
approach allows for independent motion of the free neutrons. We simulate the
thermal evolution of the SXTs within the thermodynamically consistent approach
and compare the results with the traditional approach and with observations.

into a set of matrices that represent the scene's light field. Factorization
implies the field is queried via inexpensive MLP-free matrix multiplications,
while using a light field allows rendering a pixel by querying the field a
single time-as opposed to hundreds of queries when employing a radiance field.
Since the proposed representation can be implemented using a fragment shader,
it can be directly integrated with standard rasterization frameworks. Our
flexible implementation can render a NeRF in real-time with low memory

efficiency of specific cellular processes remains a largely open problem. Here,
we analyze the efficiency of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
production through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative
phosphorylation that generates most of the cellular chemical energy in
eukaryotes. The regulation of this pathway by calcium signaling represents a
well-characterized example of a regulatory cross-talk that can affect the
energetic output of a metabolic pathway, but its concrete energetic impact
remains elusive. On the one hand, calcium enhances ATP production by activating
key enzymes of the TCA cycle, but on the other hand calcium homeostasis depends
on ATP availability. To evaluate how calcium signaling impacts the efficiency
of mitochondrial metabolism, we propose a detailed kinetic model describing the
calcium-mitochondria cross-talk and we analyze it using a nonequilibrium
thermodynamic approach: after identifying the effective reactions driving
mitochondrial metabolism out of equilibrium, we quantify the thermodynamic
efficiency of the metabolic machinery for different physiological conditions.
We find that calcium oscillations increase the efficiency with a maximum close

networks, the use of IRS in vehicular networks is also considered. Prior works
on IRS-aided vehicle-to-everything communications focus on deploying reflection
surfaces on the facades of buildings along the road for sidelink performance
enhancement. This paper goes beyond the state of the art by presenting a novel
paradigm coined Intelligent Reflecting Vehicle Surface (IRVS). It embeds a
massive number of reflection elements on vehicles' surfaces to aid moving
vehicular networks in military and emergency communications. We propose an
alternative optimization method to optimize jointly active beamforming at the
base station and passive reflection across multiple randomly-distributed
vehicle surfaces. Performance evaluation in terms of sum spectral efficiency
under continuous, discrete, and random phase shifts is conducted. Numerical
results reveal that IRVS can substantially improve the capacity of a moving
vehicular network.

attribution-based diversity metric to improve the known accuracy-diversity
trade-off of the typical prediction-based diversity. Our motivation is based on
analytical studies of design diversity that have shown that a reduction of
common failure modes is possible if diversity of design choices is achieved.
  Using ResNet50 as a comparison baseline, we evaluate the resiliency of
multiple individual DL model architectures against dataset distribution shifts
corresponding to natural image corruptions. We compare ensembles created with
diverse model architectures trained either independently or through a Neural
Architecture Search technique and evaluate the correlation of prediction-based

set of diversity enforcement heuristics based on negative correlation learning
to assess the final ensemble resilience to natural image corruptions and
inspect the resulting prediction, activation, and attribution diversity.
  Our key observations are: 1) model architecture is more important for
resiliency than model size or model accuracy, 2) attribution-based diversity is
less negatively correlated to the ensemble accuracy than prediction-based
diversity, 3) a balanced loss function of individual and ensemble accuracy
creates more resilient ensembles for image natural corruptions, 4) architecture
diversity produces more diversity in all explored diversity metrics:
predictions, attributions, and activations.

Centered at the University of Chicago, its assumptions, most especially that

commercial transactions are conducted. But what if the Chicago School, as I
refer to this line of thinking, is wrong? Alternative approaches such as
behavioral law and economics or law and political economy contend that human
decisionmaking is based on emotions or should not be regulated as a social
geometry of bargains. This Article proposes a different and wholly novel reason
that the Chicago School is wrong: a fundamental assumption central to many of
its game theory models has been disproven. This Article shows that a 2012
breakthrough from world famous physicist Freeman Dyson shocked the world of
game theory. This Article shows that Chicago School game theorists are wrong on
their own terms because these 2 x 2 games such as the Prisoner's Dilemma,
Chicken, and Snowdrift, ostensibly based on mutual defection and corrective
justice, in fact yield to an insight of pure cooperation. These new game theory
solutions can be scaled to design whole institutions and systems that honor the
pure cooperation insight, holding out the possibility of cracking large scale
social dilemmas like the tragedy of the commons. It demonstrates that, in such

complex nature of biomedical datasets and the use of black-box ML models, a

interpretable ML (IML) approaches have been developed, but the curse of

proposes a novel computational strategy for the stratification of biomedical
problem datasets into k-fold cross-validation (CVs) and integrating domain
knowledge interpretation techniques embedded into the current state-of-the-art
IML frameworks. This approach can improve model stability, establish trust, and
provide explanations for outcomes generated by trained IML models.
Specifically, the model outcome, such as aggregated feature weight importance,
can be linked to further domain knowledge interpretations using techniques like
pathway functional enrichment, drug targeting, and repurposing databases.
Additionally, involving end-users and clinicians in focus group discussions
before and after the choice of IML framework can help guide testable

solutions in the biomedical field. Overall, this study highlights the potential
of combining advanced computational techniques with domain knowledge

and propose a self-adaptive OPC framework to improve efficiency. Firstly we
choose different OPC solvers adaptively for patterns of different complexity
from an extensible solver pool to reach a speed/accuracy co-optimization. Apart
from that, we prove the feasibility of reusing optimized masks for repeated
patterns and hence, build a graph-based dynamic pattern library reusing stored
masks to further speed up the OPC flow. Experimental results show that our
framework achieves substantial improvement in both performance and efficiency.

dynamics, non-repetitive finger gaits, and the need to indirectly control
unactuated objects. Further adapting a successful manipulation skill to new
objects with different shapes and physical properties is a similarly
challenging problem. In this work, we show that natural and robust in-hand
manipulation of simple objects in a dynamic simulation can be learned from a
high quality motion capture example via deep reinforcement learning with
careful designs of the imitation learning problem. We apply our approach on
both single-handed and two-handed dexterous manipulations of diverse object
shapes and motions. We then demonstrate further adaptation of the example
motion to a more complex shape through curriculum learning on intermediate
shapes morphed between the source and target object. While a naive curriculum
of progressive morphs often falls short, we propose a simple greedy curriculum
search algorithm that can successfully apply to a range of objects such as a
teapot, bunny, bottle, train, and elephant.

future trajectories of other agents around it. Trajectory prediction is an
extremely challenging task which recently gained a lot of attention in the
autonomous vehicle research community. Trajectory-prediction forecasts future
state of all the dynamic agents in the scene given their current and past
states. A good prediction model can prevent collisions on the road, and hence
the ultimate goal for autonomous vehicles: Collision rate: collisions per
Million miles. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the
field trajectory-prediction. We categorize the relevant algorithms into
different classes so that researchers can follow through the trends in the
trajectory-prediction research field. Moreover we also touch upon the
background knowledge required to formulate a trajectory-prediction problem.

provides emotion labels for the dialogues. MultiWOZ was partitioned initially
for another purpose, resulting in a distributional shift when considering the
new purpose of emotion recognition. The emotion tags in EmoWoz are highly
imbalanced and unevenly distributed across the partitions, which causes
sub-optimal performance and poor comparison of models. We propose a stratified
sampling scheme based on emotion tags to address this issue, improve the
dataset's distribution, and reduce dataset shift. We also introduce a special
technique to handle conversation (sequential) data with many emotional tags.
Using our proposed sampling method, models built upon EmoWoz can perform
better, making it a more reliable resource for training conversational agents
with emotional intelligence. We recommend that future researchers use this new
partitioning to ensure consistent and accurate performance evaluations.

to the lack of publicly accessible real-world datasets, most research focuses
on generating synthetic waveforms with software-defined radios (SDRs) which are
not suited for practical deployment settings. On other hand, the limited
datasets that are available focus only on chipsets that generate only one kind
of waveform. Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) combo chipsets that support two
wireless standards (for example WiFi and Bluetooth) over a shared dual-band
antenna such as those found in laptops, adapters, wireless chargers, Raspberry
Pis, among others are becoming ubiquitous in the IoT realm. Hence, to keep up
with the modern IoT environment, there is a pressing need for real-world open
datasets capturing emissions from these combo chipsets transmitting
heterogeneous communication protocols. To this end, we capture the first known
emissions from the COTS IoT chipsets transmitting WiFi and Bluetooth under two
different time frames. The different time frames are essential to rigorously
evaluate the generalization capability of the models. To ensure widespread use,
each capture within the comprehensive 72 GB dataset is long enough (40
MSamples) to support diverse input tensor lengths and formats. Finally, the
dataset also comprises emissions at varying signal powers to account for the
feeble to high signal strength emissions as encountered in a real-world

ChatGPT on the Grammatical Error Correction(GEC) task, and compare it with
commercial GEC product (e.g., Grammarly) and state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
GECToR). By testing on the CoNLL2014 benchmark dataset, we find that ChatGPT
performs not as well as those baselines in terms of the automatic evaluation
metrics (e.g., $F_{0.5}$ score), particularly on long sentences. We inspect the
outputs and find that ChatGPT goes beyond one-by-one corrections. Specifically,
it prefers to change the surface expression of certain phrases or sentence
structure while maintaining grammatical correctness. Human evaluation
quantitatively confirms this and suggests that ChatGPT produces less
under-correction or mis-correction issues but more over-corrections. These
results demonstrate that ChatGPT is severely under-estimated by the automatic
evaluation metrics and could be a promising tool for GEC.

  framework for high-dimensional stress field","17 pages, 16 figures, IDETC Conference Submission",,,,"cs.CE cs.LG cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern computational methods, involving highly sophisticated mathematical
formulations, enable several tasks like modeling complex physical phenomenon,
predicting key properties and design optimization. The higher fidelity in these
computer models makes it computationally intensive to query them hundreds of
times for optimization and one usually relies on a simplified model albeit at
the cost of losing predictive accuracy and precision. Towards this, data-driven
surrogate modeling methods have shown a lot of promise in emulating the
behavior of the expensive computer models. However, a major bottleneck in such
methods is the inability to deal with high input dimensionality and the need
for relatively large datasets. With such problems, the input and output
quantity of interest are tensors of high dimensionality. Commonly used
surrogate modeling methods for such problems, suffer from requirements like
high number of computational evaluations that precludes one from performing
other numerical tasks like uncertainty quantification and statistical analysis.
In this work, we propose an end-to-end approach that maps a high-dimensional
image like input to an output of high dimensionality or its key statistics. Our
approach uses two main framework that perform three steps: a) reduce the input
and output from a high-dimensional space to a reduced or low-dimensional space,
b) model the input-output relationship in the low-dimensional space, and c)
enable the incorporation of domain-specific physical constraints as masks. In
order to accomplish the task of reducing input dimensionality we leverage
principal component analysis, that is coupled with two surrogate modeling
methods namely: a) Bayesian hybrid modeling, and b) DeepHyper's deep neural
networks. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach on a problem of a
linear elastic stress field data.

challenges to application developers. In addition to requiring code portability
across different parallelization schemes, programs targeting these
architectures have to be highly adaptable in terms of compute kernel sizes to
accommodate different execution characteristics for various heterogeneous
workloads. In this paper, we demonstrate an approach to code and performance
portability that is based entirely on established standards in the industry. In
addition to applying Kokkos as an abstraction over the execution of compute
kernels on different heterogeneous execution environments, we show that the use
of standard C++ constructs as exposed by the HPX runtime system enables superb
portability in terms of code and performance based on the real-world Octo-Tiger

levels provided by HPX and Kokkos. Adding vectorization support for ARM's SVE

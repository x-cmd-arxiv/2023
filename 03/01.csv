  Adelaide)",,,,"q-bio.NC nlin.AO physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  To date, the mechanisms underlying the diversity of the emergent patterns of
collective motion in locust hopper bands remain to be unveiled. This study
investigates the role of speed heterogeneity in the emergence of the most
common patterns (frontal and columnar), following the Self-Organization
framework. To address whether marching activity intermittency and
density-dependant hopping individual behaviours could underlie the formation of
such patterns, a three-zone Self-Propelled Particles model variant was
formulated. In this model, individuals alternated between marching and resting
periods, and were more likely to hop when crowded. The model successfully
predicted the emergence of both patterns of interest, with the presence of a
density-dependent hopping probability being a necessary condition. Short to
absent pause periods mostly resulted in columnar shapes, similar to the ones
observed in the brown locust (Locustana pardalina) and long pause periods
rather resulted in frontal shapes, such as exhibited by the Australian plague
locust (Chortoicetes terminifera). Furthermore, the density profiles of
simulated frontal formations displayed the same shape as empirical profiles of
Australian plague locust hopper bands. Both simulated and experimental paint
marking experiments showed that locusts initially located at different
positions in the band were find together at its front after a few hours
marching; an expected global behavior in hopper bands undergoing activity
intermittency. These results represent an important first step towards a
cross-species comparison of locust mass migration patterns.

  denial-of-service attacks","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control",,,,"eess.SY cs.GT cs.IT cs.SY math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Multi-agent systems often communicate over low-power shared wireless networks
in unlicensed spectrum, prone to denial-of-service attacks. We consider the
following scenario: multiple pairs of agents communicating strategically over
shared communication networks in the presence of a jammer who may launch a
denial-of-service. We cast this problem as a game between a coordinator who
optimizes the transmission and estimation policies jointly and a jammer who
optimizes its probability of performing an attack. We consider two cases:
point-to-point channels and large-scale networks with a countably infinite
number of sensor-receiver pairs. When the jammer proactively attacks the
channel, the game is nonconvex from the coordinator's perspective. However,
despite the lack of convexity, we construct a saddle point equilibrium solution
for any multi-variate Gaussian distribution for the observations. When the
jammer is reactive, we obtain an algorithm based on sequential convex
optimization, which converges swiftly to first-order Nash-equilibria.
Interestingly, blocking the channel is often optimal when the jammer is
reactive, even when it is idle, to create ambiguity at the receiver.

algorithms employ the assumption that the GD process is (almost surely) bounded
and, also in concrete numerical simulations, divergence of the GD process may
slow down, or even completely rule out, convergence of the error function. In
practical relevant learning problems, it thus seems to be advisable to design
the ANN architectures in a way so that GD optimization processes remain
bounded. The property of the boundedness of GD processes for a given learning
problem seems, however, to be closely related to the existence of minimizers in
the optimization landscape and, in particular, GD trajectories may escape to
infinity if the infimum of the error function (objective function) is not
attained in the optimization landscape. This naturally raises the question of
the existence of minimizers in the optimization landscape and, in the situation
of shallow residual ANNs with multi-dimensional input layers and
multi-dimensional hidden layers with the ReLU activation, the main result of
this work answers this question affirmatively for a general class of loss
functions and all continuous target functions. In our proof of this statement,
we propose a kind of closure of the search space, where the limits are called
generalized responses, and, thereafter, we provide sufficient criteria for the
loss function and the underlying probability distribution which ensure that all
additional artificial generalized responses are suboptimal which finally allows
us to conclude the existence of minimizers in the optimization landscape.

the past decade, with research focusing on three memory regimes: the
superlinear regime, the near-linear regime, and the sublinear regime. The
sublinear regime is the most desirable in practice, but conditional hardness
results point towards its limitations.
  In this work we study a \emph{heterogeneous} model, where the memory of the
machines varies in size. We focus mostly on the heterogeneous setting created
by adding a single near-linear machine to the sublinear MPC regime, and show
that even a single large machine suffices to circumvent most of the conditional
hardness results for the sublinear regime: for graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$
edges, we give (a) an MST algorithm that runs in $O(\log\log(m/n))$ rounds; (b)
an algorithm that constructs an $O(k)$-spanner of size $O(n^{1+1/k})$ in $O(1)$
rounds; and (c) a maximal-matching algorithm that runs in
$O(\sqrt{\log(m/n)}\log\log(m/n))$ rounds.
  We also observe that the best known near-linear MPC algorithms for several
other graph problems which are conjectured to be hard in the sublinear regime
(minimum cut, maximal independent set, and vertex coloring) can easily be
transformed to work in the heterogeneous MPC model with a single near-linear
machine, while retaining their original round complexity in the near-linear
regime. If the large machine is allowed to have \emph{superlinear} memory, all
of the problems above can be solved in $O(1)$ rounds.

annotate every appearing object due to expensive costs and limited knowledge.
When facing such a challenge, a more practical and cheaper alternative should
be Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL), where only one positive label
needs to be provided per sample. Existing SPMLL methods usually assume unknown
labels as negatives, which inevitably introduces false negatives as noisy
labels. More seriously, Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss is often used for
training, which is notoriously not robust to noisy labels. To mitigate this
issue, we customize an objective function for SPMLL by pushing only one pair of
labels apart each time to prevent the domination of negative labels, which is
the main culprit of fitting noisy labels in SPMLL. To further combat such noisy
labels, we explore the high-rankness of label matrix, which can also push apart
different labels. By directly extending from SPMLL to MLL with full labels, a
unified loss applicable to both settings is derived. Experiments on real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed loss not only performs more robustly to
noisy labels for SPMLL but also works well for full labels. Besides, we
empirically discover that high-rankness can mitigate the dramatic performance
drop in SPMLL. Most surprisingly, even without any regularization or fine-tuned
label correction, only adopting our loss defeats state-of-the-art SPMLL methods
on CUB, a dataset that severely lacks labels.

extensive applications in various fields. The most commonly used methods are
the algorithms designed to maximize modularity over different partitions of the
network nodes. Using 80 real and random networks from a wide range of contexts,
we investigate the extent to which current heuristic modularity maximization
algorithms succeed in returning maximum-modularity (optimal) partitions. We
evaluate (1) the ratio of the algorithms' output modularity to the maximum
modularity for each input graph, and (2) the maximum similarity between their
output partition and any optimal partition of that graph. We compare eight
existing heuristic algorithms against an exact integer programming method that
globally maximizes modularity. The average modularity-based heuristic algorithm
returns optimal partitions for only 16.9% of the 80 graphs considered.
Additionally, results on adjusted mutual information reveal substantial
dissimilarity between the sub-optimal partitions and any optimal partition of
the networks in our experiments. More importantly, our results show that
near-optimal partitions are often disproportionately dissimilar to any optimal
partition. Taken together, our analysis points to a crucial limitation of
commonly used modularity-based heuristics for discovering communities: they
rarely produce an optimal partition or a partition resembling an optimal
partition. If modularity is to be used for detecting communities, exact or
approximate optimization algorithms are recommendable for a more
methodologically sound usage of modularity within its applicability limits.

shielding against hypervelocity impacts caused by micrometeoroids and orbital
debris. The variability of properties at feature-scale and mesoscale lengths
originating from the foam's inherently random microstructure makes predictive
models of their properties challenging. It also hinders the optimization of
components fabricated with such foams, an especially serious problem for
spacecraft design where the balance between cost and mass must also be balanced
against the catastrophic results of component failure. To address this problem,
we compute the critical transition length between the feature-scale, where
mechanical properties are determined by individual features, and the mesoscale,
where behavior is determined by ensembles of features. At the mesoscale,
distributions of properties -- with respect to both expectation value and
standard variability -- are consistent and predictable. The Kentucky Random
Structure Toolkit (KRaSTk) is applied to determine the transition from
feature-scale to mesoscale for computational volumes representing metallic
foams at a range of reduced densities. The transition is found to occur when
the side length of a cubic sample volume is ~10x greater than the
characteristic length. Comparing KRaSTk-computed converged stiffness
distributions with experimental measurements of a commercial metallic foam
found excellent agreement for both expectation value and standard variability
at all reduced densities. Lastly, we observe that the diameter of a
representative MMOD strike is ~30x shorter than the feature-scale to mesoscale
transition for the foam at any reduced density. Therefore, features will
determine response to hypervelocity impacts, rather than bulk (or even
mesoscale) structure.

Gravity (LQG). This spacetime is regular everywhere and presents the global
structure of a wormhole, with a minimal surface whose radius depends on a LQG
parameter. We focus on the investigation of massless scalar field perturbations
over the spacetime. We compute the QNMs with the WKB approximation, as well as
the continued fraction method. The QNM frequency orbits, for $l=0$ and $n>0$,
where $l$ and $n$ are the multipole and overtone numbers, respectively, are
self-intersecting, spiraling curves in the complex plane. These orbits
accumulate to a fixed complex value corresponding to the QNMs of the extremal
case. We obtain that, for small values of the LQG parameter, the overall
damping decreases as we increase the LQG parameter. Moreover the spectrum of
the quantum corrected black hole exhibits an oscillatory pattern, which might
imply in the existence of QNMs with vanishing real part. This pattern suggests
that the limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ for the real part of the QNMs is not
well-defined, what differs from Schwarzschild's case. We also analyze the
time-domain profiles for the scalar perturbations, showing that the LQG
correction does not alter the Schwarzschild power-law tail. We compute the
fundamental mode from the time profile by means of the Prony method, obtaining
excellent agreement with the two previously mentioned methods.

consider the problem of modifying a graph such that the resulting graph has
pathwidth at most 1. The problem Pathwidth-One Vertex Explosion (POVE) asks
whether such a graph can be obtained using at most $k$ vertex explosions, where
a vertex explosion replaces a vertex $v$ by deg$(v)$ degree-1 vertices, each
incident to exactly one edge that was originally incident to $v$. For POVE, we
give an FPT algorithm with running time $O(4^k \cdot m)$ and a quadratic
kernel, thereby improving over the $O(k^6)$-kernel by Ahmed et al. [GD 22] in a
more general setting. Similarly, a vertex split replaces a vertex $v$ by two
distinct vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ and distributes the edges originally incident
to $v$ arbitrarily to $v_1$ and $v_2$. Analogously to POVE, we define the
problem variant Pathwidth-One Vertex Splitting (POVS) that uses the split
operation instead of vertex explosions. Here we obtain a linear kernel and an
algorithm with running time $O((6k+12)^k \cdot m)$. This answers an open
question by Ahmed et al. [GD22].
  Finally, we consider the problem $\Pi$ Vertex Splitting ($\Pi$-VS), which
generalizes the problem POVS and asks whether a given graph can be turned into
a graph of a specific graph class $\Pi$ using at most $k$ vertex splits. For
graph classes $\Pi$ that can be tested in monadic second-order graph logic
(MSO$_2$), we show that the problem $\Pi$-VS can be expressed as an MSO$_2$
formula, resulting in an FPT algorithm for $\Pi$-VS parameterized by $k$ if
$\Pi$ additionally has bounded treewidth. We obtain the same result for the

data fits to the advanced Bloch-Gr\""uneisen model showed that each of

characteristic temperature, $T_{\omega}$ (which has the meaning of the Debye
temperature at p=5). We found that p=2.0 in Nd- and Pr-based compounds, and
p=1.3 for La-based compound. The latter value does not have any interpretation
within established theoretical models. We also analyzed $\rho(T)$ data for
$Nd_{1-x}Sr_{x}NiO_{2}$ (0.125 < x < 0.325) reported by Lee et al (2022

incompressible, with the capillary number being the key parameter that
determines the severity of the instability. Here, we consider a radially
outward displacement driven by the steady compression of a gas reservoir. The
associated gas injection rate is then unsteady due to the compressibility of
the gas. We identify a second nondimensional parameter, the compressibility
number, that plays a strong role in the development of the fingering pattern.
We use an axisymmetric model to study the impact of compressibility number on
the unsteady evolution of injection rate and gas pressure. We use linear
stability analysis to show that increasing the compressibility number delays
the onset of finger development relative to the corresponding incompressible

systematically decreases the severity of the fingering pattern at high

we succeed at driving a coherent stimulated Raman transition in a single

very long baseline interferometry (SVLBI). Here we report SVLBI experiments
conducted using the orbiting RadioAstron Observatory that have resulted in
detections of the H$_2$O 22 GHz emission in NGC\,4258, with Earth-space
baselines of 1.3, 9.5 and 19.5 Earth diameters. Observations at the highest
angular resolution of 11 and 23 $\mu$as show distinct and regularly spaced
regions within the rotating disc, at an orbital radius of about 0.126 pc. These
observations at three subsequent epochs also indicate a time evolution of the
emission features, with a sudden rise in amplitude followed by a slow decay.
The formation of the emission regions, their regular spacing and their
time-dependent behaviour appear consistent with the occurrence of a periodic
magneto-rotational instability in the disc. This type of shear-driven
instability within the differentially rotating disc has been suggested to be
the mechanism governing the radial momentum transfer and viscosity within a
mass-accreting disc. The connection of the H$_2$O MegaMaser activity with the
magneto-rotational instability activity would make it an indicator of the
mass-accretion rate in the nuclear disc of the host galaxy.

data integration, further treatments on the multi-sourced dataset are required
due to several reasons. First, the possibility of carrying more than one device
could result in duplicated observations from the same data subject.
Additionally, when utilizing multiple data sources, the same device might be
captured by more than one data provider. Our paper proposes a data integration
methodology for multi-sourced data to investigate the feasibility of
integrating data from several sources without introducing additional biases to
the data. By leveraging the uniqueness of travel pattern of each device,
duplicate devices are identified. The proposed methodology is shown to be
cost-effective while it achieves the desired accuracy level. Our findings
suggest that devices sharing the same imputed home location and the top five

taking a unique approach to analyzing bidirectional (i.e. longitudinal and
lateral) control features of drivers, using a simple rule-based classification
process to group their driving behaviors and habits. We have analyzed high
resolution driving data from the real-world CV-testbed, Safety Pilot Model
Deployment, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to identify diverse driving behavior on
freeway, arterial, and ramp road types. Using three vehicular features known as
jerk, leading headway, and yaw rate, driving characteristics are classified
into two groups (Safe Driving and Hostile Driving) on short-term
classification, and drivers habits are categorized into three classes (Calm
Driver, Rational Driver, and Aggressive Driver). Proposed classification models
are tested on unclassified datasets to validate the model conviction regarding
speeding and steep acceleration. Through the proposed method, behavior
classification has been successfully identified about 90 percent of speeding
and similar level of acute acceleration instances. In addition, our study
advances an ADAS interface that interacts with drivers in real-time in order to
transform information about driving behaviors and habits into feedback to
individual drivers. We propose an adaptive and flexible classification approach
to identify both short-term and long-term driving behavior from naturalistic
driving data to identify and, eventually, communicate adverse driving

This can be used in many practical applications where a decision tree or tree

outcomes of a decision. We propose tighter mixed-integer optimization
formulations than those previously introduced. Existing formulations can be
shown to have linear relaxations that have fractional extreme points, even for
the simple case of modeling a single decision tree. A formulation we propose,
based on a projected union of polyhedra approach, is ideal for a single
decision tree. While the formulation is generally not ideal for tree ensembles
or if additional constraints are added, it generally has fewer extreme points,
leading to a faster time to solve, particularly if the formulation has
relatively few trees. However, previous work has shown that formulations based
on a binary representation of the feature vector perform well computationally
and hence are attractive for use in practical applications. We present multiple
approaches to tighten existing formulations with binary vectors, and show that
fractional extreme points are removed when there are multiple splits on the
same feature. At an extreme, we prove that this results in ideal formulations
for tree ensembles modeling a one-dimensional feature vector. Building on this
result, we also show via numerical simulations that these additional
constraints result in significantly tighter linear relaxations when the feature
vector is low dimensional. We also present instances where the time to solve to
optimality is significantly improved using these formulations.

Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Although HMMs are some of the most widely used tools
in sequential and time series modeling, they are cryptographically hard to
learn in the standard setting where one has access to i.i.d. samples of
observation sequences. In this paper, we depart from this setup and consider an
interactive access model, in which the algorithm can query for samples from the
conditional distributions of the HMMs. We show that interactive access to the
HMM enables computationally efficient learning algorithms, thereby bypassing
cryptographic hardness. Specifically, we obtain efficient algorithms for
learning HMMs in two settings:
  (a) An easier setting where we have query access to the exact conditional
probabilities. Here our algorithm runs in polynomial time and makes
polynomially many queries to approximate any HMM in total variation distance.
  (b) A harder setting where we can only obtain samples from the conditional
distributions. Here the performance of the algorithm depends on a new
parameter, called the fidelity of the HMM. We show that this captures
cryptographically hard instances and previously known positive results.
  We also show that these results extend to a broader class of distributions
with latent low rank structure. Our algorithms can be viewed as generalizations
and robustifications of Angluin's $L^*$ algorithm for learning deterministic
finite automata from membership queries.

rules mining (ARM) was utilized. Based on the generated rules, the findings
reveal several interesting crash patterns in the daylight,
dark-with-streetlight, and dark-no-streetlight, emphasizing the importance of
investigating RwD crash patterns depending on the lighting conditions. In
daylight, fatal RwD crashes are associated with cloudy weather conditions,
distracted drivers, standing water on the roadway, no seat belt use, and
construction zones. In dark lighting conditions (with/without streetlight), the
majority of the RwD crashes are associated with alcohol/drug involvement, young
drivers (15-24 years), driver condition (e.g., inattentive, distracted,
illness/fatigued/asleep) and colliding with animal (s). The findings reveal how
certain driver behavior patterns are connected to RwD crashes, such as a strong
association between alcohol/drug intoxication and no seat belt usage in the
dark-no-streetlight condition. Based on the identified crash patterns and
behavioral characteristics under different lighting conditions, the findings
could aid researchers and safety specialists in developing the most effective

the dynamics slow down and transition to a logarithmic growth. We verify the

multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based medium access control (MAC)
protocol operating in a single cell scenario. The user equipments (UEs) are
cast as learning agents that need to learn a proper signaling policy to
coordinate the transmission of protocol data units (PDUs) to the base station
(BS) over shared radio resources. In many MARL tasks, the conventional
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) is adopted, where each
agent receives the same global extrinsic reward from the environment. However,
this approach involves a long training time. To overcome this drawback, we
adopt the concept of learning a per-agent intrinsic reward, in which each agent
learns a different intrinsic reward signal based solely on its individual
behavior. Moreover, in order to provide an intrinsic reward function that takes
into account the long-term training history, we represent it as a long
shortterm memory (LSTM) network. As a result, each agent updates its policy
network considering both the extrinsic reward, which characterizes the
cooperative task, and the intrinsic reward that reflects local dynamics. The
proposed learning framework yields a faster convergence and higher transmission
performance compared to the baselines. Simulation results show that the
proposed learning solution yields 75% improvement in convergence speed compared
to the most performing baseline.

Knowledge distillation defines a paradigm to transfer representations from

to align feature predictions with hidden representations of the large model, so
that task-agnostic knowledge can be transferred. In specific distillation,
predictions of the small model are constrained to be consistent with those of
the large model, to transfer task-specific features which guarantee task
performance. With G2SD, the vanilla ViT-Small model respectively achieves

this issue, we propose to explicitly minimize the gradient variance of the
supernet training by jointly optimizing the sampling distributions of PAth and
DAta (PA&DA). We theoretically derive the relationship between the gradient
variance and the sampling distributions, and reveal that the optimal sampling
probability is proportional to the normalized gradient norm of path and

indicator for path and training data, and adopt an importance sampling strategy
for the supernet training. Our method only requires negligible computation cost
for optimizing the sampling distributions of path and data, but achieves lower
gradient variance during supernet training and better generalization
performance for the supernet, resulting in a more consistent NAS. We conduct
comprehensive comparisons with other improved approaches in various search

Rydberg atom (""central spin"") and surrounding polar molecules (""bath spins""),
coupled to each other via dipole-dipole interactions. By mapping internal
particle states to spin states, spin-exchanging interactions can be simulated.
As an example system geometry, we consider a ring-shaped arrangement of bath
spins, and show how it allows to exact precise control over the interaction
strengths. We demonstrate that this setup allows to realize a central spin
model with highly tunable parameters and geometry, for applications in quantum
science and technology.

Comments welcome",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The problem of how disc galaxies avoid forming bars remains unsolved. Many
galaxy models having reasonable properties continue to manifest vigorous
instabilities that rapidly form strong bars and no widely-accepted idea has yet
been advanced to account for why this does not generally happen in most disc
galaxies. The unstable mode that is responsible for bar formation is believed
to be a standing wave in a cavity that reflects off the disc centre and the
corotation radius, with amplification at corotation. Here we use simulations to
address one further idea that may perhaps inhibit the feedback loop and
therefore contribute to stability, which is to make the disc centre dynamically
hot and/or to taper away mass from the inner disc, which could be masked by a
bulge. Unfortunately, we find that neither strategy makes much difference to
the global stability of the disc in the models we have tried. We did, however,
discover one interesting wrinkle to the cavity mode: in strongly cutout discs,
the wave may reflect from a radius in the disc that is clearly outside the
centre, although the ingoing trailing wave still reflects into an
outwardly-travelling, leading wave.

coordination, 'free-riders' emerge. The free-riding agents do not contribute to
the community resources (signals), but exploit them. Most models of such
'selfish' behavior consider free-riding as evolving through mutation and
selection. Over generations, the mutation -- which is considered to create a
stable trait -- spreads through the population. This can lead to a version of
the 'Tragedy of the Commons', where the community's coordination resource gets
fully depleted or deteriorated. In contrast to this evolutionary view, we
present a reinforcement learning model, which shows that both signaling-based
coordination and free-riding behavior can emerge within a generation, through
learning based on energy minimisation. Further, we show that there can be two
types of free-riding, and both of these are not stable traits, but dynamic
'coagulations' of agent-environment interactions. Our model thus shows how
different kinds of selfish behavior can emerge through self-organization, and
suggests that the idea of selfishness as a stable trait presumes a model based
on mutations. We conclude with a discussion of some social and policy
implications of our model.

$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) depending on whether the Yukawa coupling is imaginary

$\epsilon$ allows a controlled investigation of the validity of recent work
which indicates that the quartic coupling and the square of the Yukawa coupling

flow. Renormalisation group flows in coupling constant space are investigated
using the Mathematica package RGBeta, which calculates beta functions up to
three loops in the Yukawa coupling and up to two loops in the quartic scalar

multiple formation channels. Therefore, even though FRB hosts are typically

communicate visual concepts as prompts to frozen language models, but rely on

whole process learnable, we introduce a multimodal meta-learning approach.
Specifically, our approach decomposes the training of the model into a set of
related multimodal few-shot tasks. We define a meta-mapper network, acting as a
meta-learner, to efficiently bridge frozen large-scale vision and language
models and leverage their already learned capacity. By updating the learnable
parameters only of the meta-mapper, it learns to accrue shared meta-knowledge
among these tasks. Thus, it can rapidly adapt to newly presented samples with
only a few gradient updates. Importantly, it induces the task in a completely
data-driven manner, with no need for a hand-engineered task induction. We
evaluate our approach on recently proposed multimodal few-shot benchmarks,
measuring how rapidly the model can bind novel visual concepts to words and
answer visual questions by observing only a limited set of labeled examples.
The experimental results show that our meta-learning approach outperforms the
baseline across multiple datasets and various training settings while being

long-distance quantum channel to be built using pre-shared entanglement and
one-way classical communication. However, the quality of the established
channel crucially depends on the quality of the pre-shared entanglement. In
this work, we revisit the problem of using noisy entanglement for the task of
teleportation. We first show how this problem can be rephrased as a state
discrimination problem. In this picture, a quantitative duality between
teleportation and dense coding emerges in which every Alice-to-Bob
teleportation protocol can be repurposed as a Bob-to-Alice dense coding
protocol, and the quality of each protocol can be measured by the success
probability in the same state discrimination problem. One of our main results
provides a complete characterization of the states that offer no advantage in
one-way teleportation protocols over classical states, thereby offering a new
and intriguing perspective on the long-standing open problem of identifying
such states. This also yields a new proof of the known fact that bound
entangled states cannot exceed the classical teleportation threshold. Moreover,
our established duality between teleportation and dense coding can be used to
show that the exact same states are unable to provide a non-classical advantage
for dense coding as well. We also discuss the duality from a communication
capacity point of view, deriving upper and lower bounds on the accessible
information of a dense coding protocol in terms of the fidelity of its
associated teleportation protocol. A corollary of this discussion is a simple
proof of the previously established fact that bound entangled states do not
provide any advantage in dense coding.

detected, astrochemists have added new reactions, based on laboratory
experiments and quantum mechanics (QM) computations as well as reactions
inferred by chemical intuition and similarity principle. However, sometimes no
verification of their feasibility in the interstellar conditions, namely their
exothermicity, was performed. In this work, we present a new gas-phase reaction
network, GRETOBAPE, based on the KIDA2014 network and updated with several
reactions, cleaned from endothermic reactions not explicitly recognized as
such. To this end, we characterized all the species in the GRETOBAPE network
with accurate QM calculations. We found that 5% of the reactions in the
original network are endothermic although most of them are reported as
barrierless. The reaction network of Si-bearing species is the most impacted by
the endothermicity cleaning process. We also produced a cleaned reduced
network, GRETOBAPE-red, to be used to simulate astrochemical situations where
only C-, O-, N- and S- bearing species with less than 6 atoms are needed.
Finally, the new GRETOBAPE network, its reduced version, as well as the

$\sim 20$%. We measured dust column densities, temperatures and opacity indices
by fitting spectral energy distributions constructed from SCUBA-2 and archival
Herschel observations, and used archival GALEX and Spitzer data to make maps of
surface density of star formation ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$). Typically, comparing
SCUBA-2-derived H$_2$ surface densities ($\Sigma_{\rm H_2}$) to $\Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$ gives shallow star formation law indices within galaxies, with
SCUBA-2-derived values typically being sublinear and Herschel-derived values
typically being broadly linear. This difference is likely due to the effects of
atmospheric filtering on the SCUBA-2 data. Comparing the mean values of
$\Sigma_{\rm H_2}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ of the galaxies in our sample returns
a steeper star formation law index, broadly consistent with both the
Kennicutt-Schmidt value of 1.4 and linearity. Our results show that a SCUBA-2
detection is a good predictor of star formation. We suggest that Herschel
emission traces gas in regions which will form stars on timescales $\sim 5-100$
Myr, comparable to the star formation timescale traced by GALEX and Spitzer
data, while SCUBA-2 preferentially traces the densest gas within these regions,
which likely forms stars on shorter timescales.

  Background: LOD structures are required to render hundreds of millions to

  Results: LOD structures suitable for rendering and streaming are constructed
at rates of about 1 billion points per second (with color filtering) to 4
billion points per second (sample-picking/random sampling, state of the art) on
an RTX 3090 -- an improvement of a factor of 80 to 400 times over the CPU-based

improvement comes in spite of the fact that the LRMM model only has access to

The current MOT methods store objects information, like objects' trajectory, in
internal memory to recover the objects after occlusions. However, they retain
short-term memory to save computational time and avoid slowing down the MOT
method. As a result, they lose track of objects in some occlusion scenarios,

efficient map operation and reduce memory costs for large-scene autonomous
flight. Moreover, we present a novel incremental obstacle inflation method that
significantly reduces the computational cost of inflation. The proposed method
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on various public datasets. To
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ROG-Map, we integrate it into a
complete quadrotor system and perform autonomous flights against both small
obstacles and large-scale scenes. During real-world flight tests with a 0.05 m
resolution local map and 30mx30mx12m local map size, ROG-Map takes only 29.8%
of frame time on average to update the map at a frame rate of 50 Hz (\ie, 5.96
ms in 20 ms), including 0.33% (i.e., 0.66 ms) to perform obstacle inflation,
demonstrating outstanding real-world performance. We release ROG-Map as an
open-source ROS package to promote the development of LiDAR-based motion

  turbulent boundary layers","Under review for publication in JFM Rapids",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Boundary layer flow over a realistic porous wall might contain both the
effects of wall-permeability and wall-roughness. These two effects are
typically examined in the context of a rough-wall flow, i.e., by defining a
``roughness'' length or equivalent to capture the effect of the surface on
momentum deficit/drag. In this work, we examine the hypothesis of Esteban et
al. (2022), that a turbulent boundary layer over a porous wall could be
modelled as a superposition of the roughness effects on the permeability
effects by using independently obtained information on permeability and
roughness. We carry out wind tunnel experiments at high Reynolds number ($14400
\leq Re_{\tau} \leq 33100$) on various combinations of porous walls where
different roughnesses are overlaid over a given permeable wall. Measurements
are also conducted on the permeable wall as well as the rough walls
independently to obtain the corresponding lengthscales. Analysis of mean flow
data across all these measurements suggests that an empirical formulation can
be obtained where the momentum deficit ($\Delta U^+$) is modelled as a
combination of independently obtained roughness and permeability lengthscales.
This formulation assumes the presence of outer-layer similarity across these
different surfaces, which is shown to be valid at high Reynolds numbers.
Finally, this decoupling approach is equivalent to the area-weighted power-mean
of the respective permeability and roughness lengthscales, consistent with the
approach recently suggested by Hutchins et al. (2023) to capture the effects of
heterogeneous rough surfaces.

an optimization problem involving \emph{restricted annealed free energies} for

least and greatest positive fixed points. Based in the sequent calculus,
$\mu\mathsf{LJ}$ admits a standard extension to a `circular' calculus
$\mathsf{C}\mu\mathsf{LJ}$.
  Our main result is that, perhaps surprisingly, both $\mu\mathsf{LJ}$ and
$\mathsf{C}\mu\mathsf{LJ}$ represent the same first-order functions: those
provably total in $\Pi^1_2$-$\mathsf{CA}_0$, a subsystem of second-order
arithmetic beyond the `big five' of reverse mathematics and one of the
strongest theories for which we have an ordinal analysis (due to Rathjen). This
solves various questions in the literature on the computational strength of
(circular) proof systems with fixed points.
  For the lower bound we give a realisability interpretation from an extension
of Peano Arithmetic by fixed points that has been shown to be arithmetically
equivalent to $\Pi^1_2$-$\mathsf{CA}_0$ (due to M\""ollerfeld). For the upper
bound we construct a novel computability model in order to give a totality
argument for circular proofs with fixed points. In fact we formalise this
argument itself within $\Pi^1_2$-$\mathsf{CA}_0$ in order to obtain the tight

understand the probability that it contains a given subgraph. This study
originated in classical work of Erd\H{o}s and R\'enyi (1960). More recent work
studies this question both in building a general theory of sharp versus coarse
transitions (Friedgut and Bourgain 1999; Hatami, 2012) and in results on the
location of the transition (Kahn and Kalai, 2007; Talagrand, 2010; Frankston,
Kahn, Narayanan, Park, 2019; Park and Pham, 2022).
  In inference problems, one often studies the optimal accuracy of inference as
a function of the amount of noise. In a variety of sparse recovery problems, an
``all-or-nothing (AoN) phenomenon'' has been observed: Informally, as the
amount of noise is gradually increased, at some critical threshold the
inference problem undergoes a sharp jump from near-perfect recovery to
near-zero accuracy (Gamarnik and Zadik, 2017; Reeves, Xu, Zadik, 2021). We can
regard AoN as the natural inference analogue of the sharp threshold phenomenon
in random graphs. In contrast with the general theory developed for sharp
thresholds of random graph properties, the AoN phenomenon has only been studied
so far in specific inference settings.
  In this paper we study the general problem of inferring a graph $H=H_n$
planted in an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph, thus naturally connecting the
two lines of research mentioned above. We show that questions of AoN are
closely connected to first moment thresholds, and to a generalization of the
so-called Kahn--Kalai expectation threshold that scans over subgraphs of $H$ of
edge density at least $q$. In a variety of settings we characterize AoN, by
showing that AoN occurs if and only if this ``generalized expectation
threshold'' is roughly constant in $q$. Our proofs combine techniques from
random graph theory and Bayesian inference.

drastically improve data efficiency, and (iii) completely eliminate the need

Specifically, we show that in such systems, correctness is preserved even if
the nodes execute asynchronously and rely on old/inconsistent information of
other nodes. We present two variations for inducing DAGs --
\textit{DAG-inducing problems}, where the problem definition itself induces a
DAG, and \textit{DAG-inducing algorithms}, where a DAG is induced by the
algorithm.
  We demonstrate that the dominant clique (DC) problem and shortest path (SP)
problem are DAG-inducing problems. Among these, DC allows self-stabilization,
whereas the algorithm that we present for SP does not. We demonstrate that
maximal matching (MM) and 2-approximation vertex cover (VC) are not

humanitarian organizations from responding to large-scale crises. Currently,
socioeconomic surveys are the only method implemented on a large scale for
organizations and researchers to measure and track poverty. However, the
inability to collect survey data efficiently and inexpensively leads to
significant temporal gaps in poverty data; these gaps severely limit the
ability of organizational entities to address poverty at its root cause. We
propose a transfer learning model based on surface temperature change and
remote sensing data to extract features useful for predicting poverty rates.
Machine learning, supported by data sources of poverty indicators, has the
potential to estimate poverty rates accurately and within strict time
constraints. Higher temperatures, as a result of climate change, have caused
numerous agricultural obstacles, socioeconomic issues, and environmental
disruptions, trapping families in developing countries in cycles of poverty. To
find patterns of poverty relating to temperature that have the highest
influence on spatial poverty rates, we use remote sensing data. The two-step
transfer model predicts the temperature delta from high resolution satellite
imagery and then extracts image features useful for predicting poverty. The
resulting model achieved 80% accuracy on temperature prediction. This method
takes advantage of abundant satellite and temperature data to measure poverty
in a manner comparable to the existing survey methods and exceeds similar

sunspot-number series is inhomogeneous in quality and too short to study robust
parameters of long-term solar variability. The cosmogenic-isotope proxy extends
the timescale to twelve millennia and provides crucial observational
constraints of the long-term solar dynamo modulation. Here, we present a brief
up-to-date overview of the long-term variability of solar activity at
centennial--millennial timescales. The occurrence of grand minima and maxima is
discussed as well as the existing quasi-periodicities such as centennial
Gleissberg, 210-year Suess/de Vries and 2400-year Hallstatt cycles. It is shown
that the solar cycles contain an important random component and have no

comprehensive review of the theoretical perspectives to explain the observed

nonlinearity and stochastic fluctuations in the dynamo. We keep gaining

drawn from some target distribution -- e.g., the Gaussian -- must pass the

Massart noise models where the learner is allowed to fail arbitrarily if the
distributional assumption does not hold.
  We consider the setting where the target distribution is Gaussian (or more
generally any strongly log-concave distribution) in $d$ dimensions and the
noise model is either Massart or adversarial (agnostic). For Massart noise, our
tester-learner runs in polynomial time and outputs a hypothesis with
(information-theoretically optimal) error $\mathsf{opt} + \epsilon$ for any
strongly log-concave target distribution. For adversarial noise, our
tester-learner obtains error $O(\mathsf{opt}) + \epsilon$ in polynomial time

quasipolynomial time.
  Prior work on testable learning ignores the labels in the training set and
checks that the empirical moments of the covariates are close to the moments of
the base distribution. Here we develop new tests of independent interest that
make critical use of the labels and combine them with the moment-matching

surfaces, the extrinsic geometry is tightly coupled to the intrinsic geometry,

two defects at antipodal points. Finally, we close by pointing out that our

Release 3 (RVS, DR3), we find a new and robust feature in the phase space
distribution of halo stars. It is a prominent ridge at energies
$E\approx-1.4\times10^5$ km$^2$ s$^{-2}$ and with angular momemtum $L_z>0$. We
run test particle simulations of a stellar halo-like distribution of particles
in a realistic Milky Way potential with a rotating bar. We observe similar
structures generated in the simulations from the trapping of particles in
resonances with the bar, particularly at the corotation resonance. Many of the
orbits trapped at the resonances are halo-like, with large vertical excursions
from the disc. The location of the observed structure in energy space is
consistent with a bar pattern speed in the range
$\Omega_\mathrm{b}\approx35-40$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. Overall, the effect of
the resonances is to give the inner stellar halo a mild, net spin in the
direction of the bar's rotation. As the distribution of the angular momentum
becomes asymmetric, a population of stars with positive mean $L_z$ and low
vertical action is created. The variation of the average rotational velocity of
the simulated stellar halo with radius is similar to the behaviour of
metal-poor stars in data from the APOGEE survey. Though the effects of bar
resonances have long been known in the Galactic disc, this is strong evidence
that the bar can drive changes even in the diffuse and extended stellar halo
through its resonances.

the known star cluster OGLE-CL LMC 407, measure its absolute PM for the first

cluster dispersion sets an upper limit of 24 $\mu$as yr$^{-1}$ (5.6 km

dispersion of 33.8 $\pm$ 0.6 km s$^{-1}$, while younger blue populations have a
narrower velocity distribution, but with a significant kinematical
substructure. We discuss how this relates to the larger velocity dispersions

powerful way of probing the last stages of stellar evolution. However,
detections in archival Hubble Space Telescope images are limited to about one
per year. Here, we explore whether we can increase the detection rate by using
data from ground-based wide-field surveys. Due to crowding and atmospheric
blurring, progenitor stars can typically not be identified in pre-explosion
images alone. Instead, we combine many pre-SN and late-time images to search
for the disappearance of the progenitor star. As a proof of concept, we
implement our search for ZTF data. For a few hundred images, we achieve
limiting magnitudes of about 23 mag in the g and r band. However, no progenitor
stars or long-lived outbursts are detected for 29 SNe within z<0.01, and the
ZTF limits are typically several magnitudes less constraining than detected
progenitors in the literature. Next, we estimate progenitor detection rates for
the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with the Vera C. Rubin telescope by
simulating a population of nearby SNe. The background from bright host galaxies
reduces the nominal LSST sensitivity by, on average, 0.4 mag. Over the ten-year
survey, we expect the detection of about 50 red supergiant progenitors and
several yellow and blue supergiants. The progenitors of SNe Ib and Ic are
detectable if they are brighter than -4.7 mag or -4.0 mag in the LSST i band,
respectively. In addition, we expect the detection of hundreds of pre-SN
outbursts depending on their brightness and duration.

planetary system formation. It builds on a model that includes a multitude of
physical processes. The outcome can be statistically compared with exoplanet
observations. Here, we review the population synthesis method and then use one
population to explore how different planetary system architectures emerge and
which conditions lead to their formation. The systems can be classified into
four main architectures: Class I of near-in situ compositionally ordered
terrestrial and ice planets, Class II of migrated sub-Neptunes, Class III of
mixed low-mass and giant planets, broadly similar to the Solar System, and
Class IV of dynamically active giants without inner low-mass planets. These
four classes exhibit distinct typical formation pathways and are characterised
by certain mass scales. Class I systems form from the local accretion of
planetesimals followed by a giant impact phase, and the final planet masses
correspond to the `Goldreich mass'. Class II systems form when planets reach
the `equality mass' (equal accretion and migration timescales) before the
dispersal of the gas disc, but not large enough to allow for rapid gas
accretion. Giant planets form when the `equality mass' allows for rapid gas
accretion while the planet are migrating, i.e. when the critical core mass is
reached. The main discriminant of the four classes is the initial mass of
solids in the disc, with contributions from the lifetime and mass of the gas
disc. The breakdown into classes allows to better understand which physical
processes are dominant. Comparison with observations reveals certain
differences to the actual population, pointing at limitation of theoretical
understanding. For example, the overrepresentation of synthetic super Earths
and sub-Neptunes in Class I causes these planets to be found at lower
metallicities than in observations.

topic of numerous recent studies, many of them suggesting that a phase
transition to strongly interacting conformal matter inside neutron stars is
feasible. Here we examine this hybrid star scenario using various hadronic
models, a constituent quark model with three quark flavours, and applying a
smooth crossover transition between the two. Within a Bayesian framework, we
rigorously study the effect of up-to-date constraints from neutron star
observations on the equation-of-state parameters and various neutron star
observables. Our results show that a pure quark core is only possible if the
maximum mass of neutron stars is below $\sim2.3~M_\odot$. We also find,
however, consistently with other studies, that a peak in the speed of sound,
exceeding $1/3$, is highly favoured by astrophysical measurements, which might
indicate the percolation of hadrons at $\sim3-4n_0$. Even though our prediction
for the phase transition parameters varies depending on the specific
astrophysical constraints utilized, the position of the speed of sound peak
only changes slightly, while the existence of pure quark matter below $\sim4
n_0$ is disfavoured. Additionally, we present the difference in the upper
bounds of radius estimates using the full probability density data and sharp
cut-offs, and stress the necessity of using the former.

we show that the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can further
constrain these parameters if the IMBH forms a binary with a compact remnant (a
white dwarf, a neutron star, or a stellar-mass black hole), as the
gravitational-wave signal from the binary will exhibit Doppler-shift variations
as it orbits around Sgr A$^\star$. We argue that this method is the most
effective for IMBHs with masses $10^3\,M_\odot\lesssim M_{\rm IMBH}\lesssim
10^5\,M_\odot$ and distances of $0.1$ mpc to $2$ mpc with respect to the
supermassive black hole, a region of the parameter space partially
unconstrained by other methods. We show that in this region the Doppler shift
is most likely measurable whenever the binary is detected in the LISA band, and
it can help constrain the mass and orbit of a putative IMBH in the centre of
our Galaxy. We also discuss possible ways for an IMBH to form a binary in the

different evolutionary stages. In particular, VLA1 is at the early stage of the
photoionization and it is driving a thermal radio jet, while VLA2 is a thermal,
collimated ionized wind surrounded by a dusty disk or envelope. In both sources
22 GHz water masers have been detected in the past. Those around VLA1 show a
persistent distribution along the radio jet and those around VLA2 have instead
traced the evolution from a non-collimated to a collimated outflow over a
period of 20 years. By monitoring the polarized emission of the water masers
around both VLA1 and VLA2 over a period of 6 years, we aim to determine whether
the maser distributions show any variation over time and whether the magnetic
field behaves accordingly. The EVN was used in full polarization and
phase-reference mode to measure the absolute positions of the masers and to
determine both the orientation and the strength of the magnetic field. We
observed four epochs separated by two years from 2014 to 2020. We detected
polarized emission from the water masers around both the YSOs in all the
epochs. We find that the masers around VLA1 are tracing a nondissociative shock
originating from the expansion of the thermal radio jet, while the masers
around VLA2 are tracing an asymmetric expansion of the gas that is halted in
the northeast where the gas likely encounters a very dense medium. We also
found that the magnetic field inferred from the water masers in each epoch can
be considered as a portion of a quasi-static magnetic field estimated in that
location rather than in that time. This allowed us to study locally the
morphology of the magnetic field around both YSOs in a larger area by
considering the vectors estimated in all the epochs as a whole.

phase at high luminosity. One instability may occur when the radiation pressure

depletion and refilling of the inner disk on short timescales. Such a scenario,
however, has only been quantitatively verified for a single stellar-mass black
hole. Although there are hints of these cycles in a few isolated cases, their
apparent absence in the variable emission of most bright accreting neutron
stars and black holes has been a lingering puzzle. Here we report the presence
of the same multiwavelength instability around an accreting neutron star.
Moreover, we show that the variability across the electromagnetic spectrum-from
radio to X-ray-of both black holes and neutron stars at high accretion rates
can be explained consistently if the accretion disks are unstable, producing
relativistic ejections during transitions that deplete or refill the inner
disk. Such new association allows us to identify the main physical components

We employ uncertainty relations for local quantities from which we strip off

gauge the utility of our bounds, we briefly compare their numerical values with
typical values available from experimental data. In various cases, approximate
simplified variants of the bounds that we obtain can become fairly tight, i.e.,
comparable to experimental values. These considerations lead to a minimal time

has been discovered in MATBG, including correlated insulating, unconventional
superconducting, and magnetic topological phases. The lack of microscopic
information, including precise knowledge of possible broken symmetries, has
thus far hampered our understanding of MATBG's correlated phases. Here we use
high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy to directly probe the
wavefunctions of the correlated phases in MATBG. The squares of the
wavefunctions of gapped phases, including those of the correlated insulators,
pseudogap, and superconducting phases, show distinct patterns of broken
symmetry with a $\sqrt{3}$ x $\sqrt{3}$ super-periodicity on the graphene
atomic lattice that has a complex spatial dependence on the moir\'e
superlattice scale. We introduce a symmetry-based analysis to describe our
measurements of the wavefunctions of MATBG's correlated phases with a set of
complex-valued local order parameters. For the correlated insulators in MATBG,
at fillings of $\nu$ = $\pm$ 2 electrons per moir\'e unit cell relative to
charge neutrality, we compare the observed quantum textures to those expected
for proposed theoretical ground states. In typical MATBG devices, the textures
of correlated insulators' wavefunctions closely match those of the
theoretically proposed IKS order, while in ultra-low-strain samples our data
has local symmetries like those of a T-IVC phase. We also study the
wavefunction of MATBG's superconducting state, revealing strong signatures of
intervalley coherence that can only be distinguished from those of the
insulator with our phase-sensitive measurements.

lensed by the galaxy cluster MACS J0035.4-2015 ($z_{\mathrm{d}}=0.352$). The
object is detected in Hubble Space Telescope imaging taken for the RELICS

point-source, with a de-magnified radius of $r_e\lesssim100$ pc. The object is
spectroscopically confirmed to be an AGN at $z_{\mathrm{spec}}=2.063\pm0.005$
showing broad rest-frame UV emission lines, and is detected in both X-ray
observations with Chandra and in ALCS ALMA band 6 (1.2 mm) imaging. It has a
relatively faint rest-frame UV luminosity for a quasar-like object,
$M_{\mathrm{UV},1450}=-19.7\pm0.2$. The object adds to just a few quasars or
other X-ray sources known to be multiply lensed by a galaxy cluster. Some
diffuse emission from the host galaxy is faintly seen around the nucleus and
there is a faint object nearby sharing the same multiple-imaging symmetry and
geometric redshift, possibly an interacting galaxy or a star-forming knot in
the host. We present an accompanying lens model, calculate the magnifications
and time delays, and infer physical properties for the source. We find the
rest-frame UV continuum and emission lines to be dominated by the AGN, and the
optical emission to be dominated by the host galaxy of modest stellar mass
$M_{\star}\simeq10^{9.2} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We also observe some variation in
the AGN emission with time, which may suggest that the AGN used to be more
active. This object adds a low-redshift counterpart to several relatively faint
AGN recently uncovered at high redshifts with HST and JWST.

computation cost from cubic to linear complexity. When restricted to a
candidate set of sensor placement locations, we can use greedy sequential
selection algorithms on the SGP's optimization bound to find good solutions. We
also present an approach to efficiently map our continuous space solutions to
discrete solution spaces using the assignment problem, which gives us discrete
sensor placements optimized in unison. Moreover, we generalize our approach to
model non-point sensors with an arbitrary field-of-view (FoV) shape using an

promising distributed machine learning technique for building inference models
over wireless networks due to its ability to maintain user privacy and reduce

parameters at a central parameter server (CPS), increasing energy consumption
and latency, as well as inefficiently utilizing radio resource blocks (RRBs)
for distributed user devices (UDs). This paper presents a resource-efficient FL
framework, called FedMoD (\textbf{fed}erated learning with \textbf{mo}del
\textbf{d}issemination), for millimeter-wave (mmWave) aerial-terrestrial
integrated networks with the following two unique characteristics. Firstly,
FedMoD presents a novel decentralized model dissemination algorithm that makes
use of UAVs as local model aggregators through UAV-to-UAV and device-to-device
(D2D) communications. As a result, FedMoD (i) increases the number of
participant UDs in developing FL model and (ii) achieves global model
aggregation without involving CPS. Secondly, FedMoD reduces the energy
consumption of FL using radio resource management (RRM) under the constraints
of over-the-air learning latency. In order to achieve this, by leveraging graph
theory, FedMoD optimizes the scheduling of line-of-sight (LOS) UDs to suitable
UAVs/RRBs over mmWave links and non-LOS UDs to available LOS UDs via overlay
D2D communications. Extensive simulations reveal that decentralized FedMoD
offers same convergence rate performance as compared to conventional FL
frameworks.

inhomogeneous stellar disk embedded in a non-responsive dark matter halo to
perturbations like bars, spiral arms and satellite galaxy encounters. Without
self-gravity to reinforce it, the response of a Fourier mode phase mixes away
due to an intrinsic spread in the vertical ($\Omega_z$), radial ($\Omega_r$)
and azimuthal ($\Omega_\phi$) frequencies, giving rise to local phase-space
spirals. Collisional diffusion due to scattering of stars by structures like
giant molecular clouds causes super-exponential damping of the phase-spiral
amplitude. The $z-v_z$ phase-spiral is 1-armed (2-armed) for vertically
anti-symmetric (symmetric) bending (breathing) modes. Only transient
perturbations with timescales ($\tau_{\mathrm{P}}$) comparable to the vertical
oscillation period ($\tau_z \sim 1/\Omega_z$) trigger $z-v_z$ phase-spirals.
Each $(n,l,m)$ mode of the response to impulsive
($\tau_{\mathrm{P}}<\tau=1/(n\Omega_z+l\Omega_r+m\Omega_\phi)$) perturbations
is power law ($\sim \tau_{\mathrm{P}}/\tau$) suppressed, but that to adiabatic
($\tau_{\mathrm{P}}>\tau$) perturbations is exponentially weak ($\sim
\exp{\left[-\left(\tau_{\mathrm{P}}/\tau\right)^\alpha\right]}$) except
resonant ($\tau\to \infty$) modes. Slower ($\tau_{\mathrm{P}}>\tau_z$)
perturbations, e.g., distant encounters with satellite galaxies, induce
stronger bending modes. If the Gaia phase-spiral was triggered by a satellite,
Sagittarius is the leading contender as it dominates the Solar neighborhood
response of the Milky Way disk to satellite encounters. However, survival
against collisional damping necessitates that the impact occurred within $\sim
0.6-0.7$ Gyr ago. We discuss how the detailed galactic potential dictates the
phase-spiral shape: phase mixing occurs slower and phase-spirals are less wound
in the outer disk and in presence of an ambient halo.

channel walls. In the Stokes limit\,($Re_p =0)$ and for $\lambda \ll 1$, a
spheroid rotates along any of an infinite number of Jeffery orbits
parameterized by an orbit constant $C$, while translating with a time dependent
speed along a given ambient streamline. Weak inertial effects stabilize either
the spinning\,($C=0$) or the tumbling orbit\,($C=\infty$), or both, depending
on $\kappa$. The separation of the Jeffery-rotation and orbital drift time
scales, from that associated with cross-stream migration, implies that the
latter occurs due to a Jeffery-averaged lift velocity. Although the magnitude
of this averaged lift velocity depends on $\kappa$ and $C$, the shape of the
lift profiles are identical to those for a sphere, regardless of $Re_c$. In
particular, the equilibrium positions for a spheroid remain identical to the
classical Segre-Silberberg ones for a sphere, starting off at a distance of
about $0.6(H/2)$ from the channel centerline for small $Re_c$, and migrating
wallward with increasing $Re_c$. For spheroids with $\kappa \sim O(1)$, the
Jeffery-averaged analysis is valid for $Re_p\ll1$; for extreme aspect ratio

modification to the Friedmann equations governing the evolution of the

remarkably accelerates the optimization procedure of complex tasks by
``overfitting"" specific task type, leading to enhanced performance compared to
analytical optimizers. Generally, L2O develops a parameterized optimization
method (i.e., ``optimizer"") by learning from solving sample problems. This
data-driven procedure yields L2O that can efficiently solve problems similar to
those seen in training, that is, drawn from the same ``task distribution"".
However, such learned optimizers often struggle when new test problems come
with a substantially deviation from the training task distribution. This paper
investigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an
L2O optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to an
out-of-distribution task, in only a few steps. We theoretically characterize
the generalization of L2O, and further show that our proposed framework (termed
as M-L2O) provably facilitates rapid task adaptation by locating well-adapted
initial points for the optimizer weight. Empirical observations on several
classic tasks like LASSO and Quadratic, demonstrate that M-L2O converges
significantly faster than vanilla L2O with only $5$ steps of adaptation,

derived from large-scale image-text data to facilitate generalisable VMR. To
address the limitations of image-text pre-training models on capturing the
video changes, we propose a generic method, referred to as Visual-Dynamic
Injection (VDI), to empower the model's understanding of video moments. Whilst
existing VMR methods are focusing on building temporal-aware video features,
being aware of the text descriptions about the temporal changes is also
critical but originally overlooked in pre-training by matching static images
with sentences. Therefore, we extract visual context and spatial dynamic
information from video frames and explicitly enforce their alignments with the
phrases describing video changes (e.g. verb). By doing so, the potentially
relevant visual and motion patterns in videos are encoded in the corresponding
text embeddings (injected) so to enable more accurate video-text alignments. We
conduct extensive experiments on two VMR benchmark datasets (Charades-STA and

VDI yields notable advantages when being tested on the out-of-distribution

(e.g. for phase matching and production of entangled photons),
micromanipulation, and as a platform for unconventional light-matter coupling,

Layered ""van der Waals"" materials, with strong intra-layer bonding and weak
inter-layer bonding, can feature some of the largest optical anisotropy;
however, their use in most optical systems is limited because their optic axis
is out of the plane of the layers and the layers are weakly attached, making
the anisotropy hard to access. Here, we demonstrate that a bulk crystal with
subtle periodic modulations in its structure -- Sr9/8TiS3 -- is transparent and
positive-uniaxial, with extraordinary index n_e = 4.5 and ordinary index n_o =
2.4 in the mid- to far-infrared. The excess Sr, compared to stoichiometric
SrTiS3, results in the formation of TiS6 trigonal-prismatic units that break
the infinite chains of face-shared TiS6 octahedra in SrTiS3 into periodic
blocks of five TiS6 octahedral units. The additional electrons introduced by
the excess Sr subsequently occupy the TiS6 octahedral blocks to form highly
oriented and polarizable electron clouds, which selectively boost the
extraordinary index n_e and result in record birefringence ({\Delta}n > 2.1
with low loss). The connection between subtle structural modulations and large
changes in refractive index suggests new categories of anisotropic materials
and also tunable optical materials with large refractive-index modulation and
low optical losses.

resolved. This paper provides a method for solving the redundancy problem. The
relevant kinematic models are derived in order to build an algorithm to
calculate desired joint velocities in real time. Different methods to optimize

no-cloning property of quantum information. We construct three new
cryptographic primitives whose security is based on uncloneability, and that
have in common that their security can be established via a novel
monogamy-of-entanglement (MoE) property:
  - We define interactive uncloneable encryption, a version of the uncloneable
encryption defined by Broadbent and Lord [TQC 2020] where the receiver must
partake in an interaction with the sender in order to decrypt the ciphertext.
We provide a one-round construction that is secure in the information-theoretic
setting, in the sense that no other receiver may learn the message even if she
eavesdrops on all the interactions.
  - We provide a way to make a bit string commitment scheme uncloneable. The
scheme is augmented with a check step chronologically in between the commit and
open steps, where an honest sender verifies that the commitment may not be
opened by an eavesdropper, even if the receiver is malicious.
  - We construct a receiver-independent quantum key distribution (QKD) scheme,
which strengthens the notion of one-sided device independent QKD of Tomamichel,
Fehr, Kaniewski, and Wehner (TFKW) [NJP 2013] by also permitting the receiver's
classical device to be untrusted. Explicitly, the sender remains fully trusted
while only the receiver's communication is trusted.

introduced by Coladangelo, Liu, Liu, and Zhandry [Crypto 2021]. In our stronger
version, the player Charlie also receives Bob's answer prior to making his
guess, simulating a party who eavesdrops on an interaction. To use this

normal indentation - drive us to form such judgments. In a series of
psychophysical experiments, this work modulates skin movements by varying
stimulus stiffness and employing various treatments. The stimuli include
brushes of three levels of stiffness and an ungloved human finger. The skin's
friction is modulated via non-hazardous chemicals and washing protocols, and
the skin's thickness and lateral movement are modulated by thin sheets of
adhesive film. The stimuli are hand-brushed at controlled forces and
velocities. Human participants report perceived pleasantness per trial using
ratio scaling. The results indicate that a brush's stiffness influenced
pleasantness more than any skin treatment. Surprisingly, varying the skin's
friction did not affect pleasantness. However, the application of a thin

be mitigated by developing higher-quality qubits. Quantum error correction
(QEC) will thus be necessary to ensure fault tolerance. QEC protects the
logical information by cyclically measuring syndrome information about the
errors. An essential part of QEC is the decoder, which uses the syndrome to
compute the likely effect of the errors on the logical degrees of freedom and
provide a tentative correction. The decoder must be accurate, fast enough to
keep pace with the QEC cycle (e.g., on a microsecond timescale for
superconducting qubits) and with hard real-time system integration to support
logical operations. As such, real-time decoding is essential to realize
fault-tolerant quantum computing and to achieve quantum advantage. In this

  proceedings were published at the conference",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stars with initial masses 7 Msun . MZAMS . 9 Msun reach temperatures high
enough to ignite C under degenerate conditions after the end of He-core burning
(Garcia-Berro & Iben 1994). These isolated stars are expected to evolve into
the so-called super AGB (SAGB) phase and may end their lives as ultra-massive
ONe WDs (see Siess 2006,2007, 2010; Camisassa et al. 2019, and references
therein). The exact proportions of O and Ne found in the core at the end of the
SAGB phase will determine the cooling times and pulsational properties of these
WDs. Uncertainties affecting the rates of nuclear reactions occurring during
the C burning phase should have a measurable impact on the distribution of 16O,
20Ne, 23Na and 24Mg and, consequently, on the evolution of the WD. Here we
present a study of the impact of uncertainties in the 12C(12C, {\alpha})20Ne
and 12C(12C, p)23Na nuclear reaction rates (and their branching ratios) on the
chemical structure of intermediate- to high-mass progenitors at the end of the
C-burning phase. Using the stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in
Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) we computed evolutionary sequences for stars with
initial masses 7.25<= MZAMS /Msun <=8.25, from the ZAMS to the SAGB phase,
adopting different prescriptions for the 12C+12C burning rates. We found that
adopting lower reaction rates for the 12C+12C burning delays C-ignition by at
most 2700 yrs, and the ignition takes place in a position further from the
center. Our results shows that differences in the 20Ne central abundances
remain modest, below 14%.

high-energy-density batteries. Numerous concerns on the potential safety
hazards of the Li metal have been brought up before its massive application in
commercialized battery packs. However, few investigations have been performed
to systematically evaluate the reactivity of Li metal anode in full cell level.
Here, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with in situ Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are used to quantitatively investigate the Li
metal reactivity. Lithiated graphite (Li-Gr) and lithiated silicon (Li-Si) are
also studied as the comparison samples. The reactivity of the plated Li when
coupled with different electrolyte composition, morphology, and atmosphere is
systematically studied. More importantly, the reactivity of Li metal full cell
with different cathode materials (NMC622, LFP and LNMO) has been compared. It
was found that all cell components, including electrolyte composition, Li
morphology, the control of inactive Li accumulation and cathode stability, are
essential in controlling the reactivity of the plated Li. After optimizing
these conditions, the Li metal full cell shows no significant thermal reaction
up to 400C. This work identifies the key parameters in controlling the
reactivity of the plated Li and may facilitate lithium metal battery design and
manufacturing in the coming future.

solar VUV photons and energetic particles from the magnetosphere of Saturn,
forming a natural N2-CH4-H2 plasma. Previous works showed some chemical
evolution processes: VUV photons slightly alter the aerosols nitrile bands,
hydrogen atoms tend to hydrogenate their surface and carbon-containing species
participate to the growth of the aerosols. This work investigates the effect of
the other plasma species, namely the N2-H2 derived ions, radicals and excited
states. Industrial plasmas often use N2-H2 discharges to form ammonia-based
fertilizers, for metal nitriding, and to erode organic surfaces. Consequently,
these are likely to affect Titan's organic aerosols. We therefore developed the
THETIS experiment to study the interactions between analogues of Titan's
aerosols (tholins) and the erosive N2-H2 plasma species found in Titan's
ionosphere. Following a first paper on the evolution of the solid phase by
Scanning Electron Microscopy and IR transmission spectroscopy (Chatain et al.,
Icarus, 2020), this paper focuses on evolution of the gas phase composition, by
neutral and ion mass spectrometry. Newly formed HCN, NH3-CN and C2N2 are
extracted from the tholins as well as some other carbon-containing species and
their derived ions. On the other hand, the production of ammonia strongly
decreases, probably because the H, NH and N radicals are rather used for the
production of HCN at the surface of tholins. Heterogeneous processes are
suggested: chemical processes induced by radicals at the surface would modify
and weaken the tholin structure, while ion sputtering would desorb small
molecules and highly unsaturated ions. The effect of plasma erosion on aerosols
in Titan's ionosphere could therefore lead to the formation of CN bonds in the
aerosol structure and the production of HCN or R-CN species in the gas phase.

ability to achieve a given goal, or to prevent the system from an undesirable
event. Among intelligent agents, the goals are often of epistemic nature, i.e.,
concern the ability to obtain knowledge about an important fact \phi. Such
properties can be e.g. expressed in ATLK, that is, alternating-time temporal
logic ATL extended with epistemic operators. In many realistic scenarios,
however, players do not need to fully learn the truth value of \phi. They may
be almost as well off by gaining some knowledge; in other words, by reducing
their uncertainty about \phi. Similarly, in order to keep \phi secret, it is
often insufficient that the intruder never fully learns its truth value.
Instead, one needs to require that his uncertainty about \phi never drops below
a reasonable threshold.
  With this motivation in mind, we introduce the logic ATLH, extending ATL with
quantitative modalities based on the Hartley measure of uncertainty. The new
logic enables to specify agents' abilities w.r.t. the uncertainty of a given
player about a given set of statements. It turns out that ATLH has the same
expressivity and model checking complexity as ATLK. However, the new logic is
exponentially more succinct than ATLK, which is the main technical result of
this paper.

bid and ask orders for a specific financial asset. As the most fine-grained
information depicting the demand and supply of an asset, LOB data is essential
in understanding market dynamics. Therefore, realistic LOB simulations offer a
valuable methodology for explaining empirical properties of markets. Mainstream
simulation models include agent-based models (ABMs) and stochastic models
(SMs). However, ABMs tend not to be grounded on real historical data, while SMs
tend not to enable dynamic agent-interaction. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel hybrid LOB simulation paradigm characterised by: (1)
representing the aggregation of market events' logic by a neural stochastic
background trader that is pre-trained on historical LOB data through a neural
point process model; and (2) embedding the background trader in a multi-agent

effects observed in optics research opening up new possibilities in sensing,
polarization control and measurement. A hallmark of non-Hermitian matrices is
the possibility of non-orthogonal eigenvectors resulting in coupling between
modes. The advantages of propagation mode coupling have been little explored in
magneto-optical filters and other devices based on birefringence.
Magneto-optical filters select for ultra-narrow transmission regions by passing
light through an atomic medium in the presence of a magnetic field. Passive
filter designs have traditionally been limited by Doppler broadening of thermal
vapors. Even for filter designs incorporating a pump laser, transmissions are
typically less than 15\% for sub-Doppler features. Here we exploit our
understanding of non-Hermitian physics to induce non-orthogonal propagation
modes in a vapor and realize better magneto-optical filters. We construct two
new filter designs with ENBWs and maximum transmissions of 181~MHz, 42\% and
140~MHz, 17\% which are the highest figure of merit and first sub-100~MHz FWHM
passive filters recorded respectively. This work opens up a range of new filter
applications including metrological devices for use outside a lab setting and
commends filtering as a new candidate for deeper exploration of non-Hermitian
physics such as exceptional points of degeneracy.

a quantum spin liquid state. Convex hull calculations using binary compounds

likelihood of interlayer substitutional disorder and spontaneous distortions of
the kagome layers. After considering all of these factors as a whole, we select
several promising candidate materials that we believe deserve further

tides for rocky planets can allow for higher spin states than the
synchronization state in the presence of eccentricities or obliquities. This
work explores the secular evolution of a star-planet system under tidal
interactions, both gravitational and thermal, induced respectively by the
quadrupolar component of the gravitational potential and the irradiation of the
planet's surface. We use the formalism of Kaula associated with an Andrade
rheology to model a relevant response of a rocky planet to gravitational tides
and a prescription of thermal tides fitted for Venus to model the response of
the atmosphere to the thermal tides. We implemented the general secular
evolution equations of tidal interactions in the secular code ESPEM (French
acronym for Evolution of Planetary System and Magnetism). We show the possible
spin-orbit evolution and resonances for eccentric orbits and explore the
possible spin orbit resonances raised by the obliquity of the planet. Our
simulations have shown that the secular evolution of the spin and obliquity can
lead to the retrograde spin of the Venus-like planet if the system starts from
a high spin obliquity, in agreement to previous studies. Taking into account
the luminosity evolution of the Sun changes the picture. We find that the
planet never reaches the equilibrium: the timescale of rotation evolution is
longer than the luminosity variation timescale, which suggests that Venus may
never reach a spin equilibrium state but may still evolve.

problem, previous works modify the architecture of transformers to incorporate
inductive biases by applying, e.g., local attention and down-sampling. Although
they have achieved promising results, earlier works on transformers for point
clouds have two issues. First, the power of plain transformers is still
under-explored. Second, they focus on simple and small point clouds instead of
complex real-world ones. This work revisits the plain transformers in
real-world point cloud understanding. We first take a closer look at some
fundamental components of plain transformers, e.g., patchifier and positional
embedding, for both efficiency and performance. To close the performance gap
due to the lack of inductive bias and annotated data, we investigate
self-supervised pre-training with masked autoencoder (MAE). Specifically, we
propose drop patch, which prevents information leakage and significantly
improves the effectiveness of MAE. Our models achieve SOTA results in semantic

optima form a continuum (e.g., due to over-parameterization). This has been
explained under various structural assumptions, including the
Polyak--{\L}ojasiewicz inequality, Quadratic Growth and the Error Bound. We
show that, for cost functions which are twice continuously differentiable
($\mathrm{C}^2$), those three (local) properties are equivalent. Moreover, we
show they are equivalent to the Morse--Bott property, that is, local minima
form differentiable submanifolds, and the Hessian of the cost function is
positive definite along its normal directions. We leverage this insight to
improve local convergence guarantees for safe-guarded Newton-type methods under
any (hence all) of the above assumptions. First, for adaptive cubic
regularization, we secure quadratic convergence even with inexact subproblem

stems from (i) the observation that an EUV plume is born as the magnetic flux
at the foot of the plume's magnetic funnel becomes tightly packed together, and
(ii) the observation that coronal heating in quiet regions increases in
proportion to the coast-line length of the underlying magnetic network. We do
not rule out the possibility that coronal heating in EUV plumes might be
stronger, not weaker, but we point out how the opposite is plausible. We reason
that increasing coronal heating during plume birth would cause co-temporal
increasing net upward mass flux in the plume, whereas decreasing coronal
heating during plume birth would cause co-temporal net downward mass flux in
quiet-region plumes and co-temporal decrease in net upward mass flux or even
net downward mass flux in coronal-hole plumes. We further reason that
conclusive evidence of weaker coronal heating in EUV plumes would strengthen
the possibility that magnetic twist waves from fine-scale magnetic explosions
at the edges of the magnetic network (1) power much of the coronal heating in
quiet regions, and (2) power most of the coronal heating and solar wind
acceleration in coronal holes, with many twist waves surviving to become

subset $A$ of the quotient ring $F[t]/Q(t)F[t]$ of density at least $\delta$
will contain distinct elements $a, b \in A$ with $b-a = P(y)$ for some $y$,
whenever $Q$ is of sufficiently high degree.
  In this paper, we obtain refinements of this result via the phenomenon of
\emph{asymptotic total ergodicity} for the quotient rings $F[t]/Q(t)F[t]$.
(This phenomenon of asymptotic total ergodicity is analogous to the phenomenon
explored by Bergelson and Best in the framework of modular rings
$\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$.) In particular, we show that if the minimal degree of
the irreducible factors of $Q_n$ diverges to infinity, then for a wide class of
polynomials $P(y) \in (F[t])[y]$, the following refinement of the
Furstenberg--S\'{a}rk\""{o}zy theorem holds: for any $\delta > 0$, for any two
subsets $A, B \subseteq F[t]/Q_n(t)F[t]$ with $|A| |B| \ge \delta
|F[t]/Q_n(t)F[t]|^2$ and $n$ sufficiently large, there exist $x, y \in
F[t]/Q_n(t)F[t]$ such that $x \in A$ and $x + P(y) \in B$. Moreover, the values
$x, y \in F[t]/Q_n(t)F[t]$ for which $x \in A$ and $x + P(y) \in B$ obey the
""correct"" statistical behavior as $n \to \infty$. The class of polynomials
$P(y)$ for which this result holds is characterized by equidistributional
behavior previously studied by Bergelson and Leibman. We also show that, in the
absence of asymptotic total ergodicity and a natural equidistribution
condition, one cannot hope for such a refinement to the
Furstenberg--S\'{a}rk\""{o}zy theorem.
  Another consequence of our results is a power saving bound for the
Furstenberg--S\'{a}rk\""{o}zy theorem over finite fields of fixed characterstic.
This complements recent work of Li and Sauermann, where a different power
saving bound is obtained using the polynomial method.

probabilistic sequences of events. First, which features make the sequence of
events generated by a stochastic chain more difficult to predict. Second, how
to model the procedures employed by different learners to identify the
structure of sequences of events. Playing the role of a goalkeeper in a video
game, participants were told to predict step by step the successive directions
-- left, center or right -- to which the penalty kicker would send the ball.
The sequence of kicks was driven by a stochastic chain with memory of variable
length. Results showed that at least three features play a role in the first
issue: 1) the shape of the context tree summarizing the dependencies between
present and past directions; 2) the entropy of the stochastic chain used to
generate the sequences of events; 3) the existence or not of a deterministic
periodic sequence underlying the sequences of events. Moreover, evidence
suggests that best learners rely less on their own past choices to identify the
structure of the sequences of events.

prevalent learning paradigm, where one first pre-trains a representation using
large-scale unlabeled data, and then learns simple predictors on top of the
representation using small labeled data from the downstream tasks. There are
two key desiderata for the representation: label efficiency (the ability to
learn an accurate classifier on top of the representation with a small amount
of labeled data) and universality (usefulness across a wide range of downstream
tasks). In this paper, we focus on one of the most popular instantiations of
this paradigm: contrastive learning with linear probing, i.e., learning a
linear predictor on the representation pre-trained by contrastive learning. We
show that there exists a trade-off between the two desiderata so that one may
not be able to achieve both simultaneously. Specifically, we provide analysis
using a theoretical data model and show that, while more diverse pre-training
data result in more diverse features for different tasks (improving
universality), it puts less emphasis on task-specific features, giving rise to
larger sample complexity for down-stream supervised tasks, and thus worse
prediction performance. Guided by this analysis, we propose a contrastive
regularization method to improve the trade-off. We validate our analysis and
method empirically with systematic experiments using real-world datasets and
foundation models.

For the class of all planar graphs the best known upper bound on the size of a

$n$. Some classes of planar graphs are known to admit universal point sets of
near linear size, however, there are no truly linear bounds for interesting

  In this paper, we show that there is a universal point set of size $2n-2$ for

also universal for the class of $n$-vertex planar graphs of maximum degree $3$.
The point set used for the results is what we call an exploding double chain,

more planar graphs, namely of all subgraphs of planar graphs admitting a
one-sided Hamiltonian cycle. The result for bipartite graphs also implies that

representations in MR data and have become state-of-the-art for accelerated MRI
reconstruction. However, undersampling the measurements in k-space as well as
the over- or under-parameterized and non-transparent nature of DL make these
models exposed to uncertainty. Consequently, uncertainty estimation has become
a major issue in DL MRI reconstruction. To estimate uncertainty, Monte Carlo
(MC) inference techniques have become a common practice where multiple
reconstructions are utilized to compute the variance in reconstruction as a
measurement of uncertainty. However, these methods demand high computational
costs as they require multiple inferences through the DL model. To this end, we
introduce a method to estimate uncertainty during MRI reconstruction using a
pixel classification framework. The proposed method, PixCUE (stands for Pixel
Classification Uncertainty Estimation) produces the reconstructed image along
with an uncertainty map during a single forward pass through the DL model. We
demonstrate that this approach generates uncertainty maps that highly correlate
with the reconstruction errors with respect to various MR imaging sequences and
under numerous adversarial conditions. We also show that the estimated
uncertainties are correlated to that of the conventional MC method. We further
provide an empirical relationship between the uncertainty estimations using
PixCUE and well-established reconstruction metrics such as NMSE, PSNR, and
SSIM. We conclude that PixCUE is capable of reliably estimating the uncertainty
in MRI reconstruction with a minimum additional computational cost.

victim based on the presence, or lack thereof, of one or more cachelines.
Determining a cacheline's presence, which we refer to as ""reading the signal"",
typically requires testing the access time of the line using a suitably high
precision timer. In this paper we introduce novel gadgets which leverage CPU
speculation to enable modification of these signals, before they are read, for
a variety of purposes. First, these gadgets enable an attacker to optimize
cache-based side channel attacks by evaluating arbitrary logic functions on
cacheline signals prior to their measurement. Second, we demonstrate
amplification techniques that enable an attacker to read a signal even if no
high precision timer is available. Combined, these techniques can be used to
improve existing side channel attacks even if timer access is limited. We
evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques on a modern x86 CPU and
demonstrate that when properly tuned, cache side channel signals can be
reliably modified with near 100% accuracy and are able to be read with a timer
as coarse as 100ms or more.

a fraction of the available laser power is absorbed by the phonon. Using the

transformations can happen via intermediate states akin to the intermediate
hexatic phases observed in equilibrium two-dimensional melting. The hexatic
phase is characterized by quasi-long-range (power-law) orientational order but
no translational order, thus endowing some structure to an otherwise
structureless fluid. While it has been shown that hexatic order in tissue
models can be induced by motility and thermal fluctuations, the role of cell
division and apoptosis (birth and death) has remained poorly understood,
despite its fundamental biological role. Here we study the effect of cell
division and apoptosis on global hexatic order within the framework of the
self-propelled Voronoi model of tissue. Although cell division naively destroys
order and active motility facilitates deformations, we show that their combined
action drives a liquid-hexatic-liquid transformation as the motility increases.
The hexatic phase is accessed by the delicate balance of dislocation defect
generation from cell division and the active binding of
disclination-antidisclination pairs from motility. We formulate a mean-field
model to elucidate this competition between cell division and motility and the
consequent development of hexatic order.

(e.g. COVID-19), is contained through testing and isolation of infected nodes.
The temporal and spatial evolution of the process (along with containment
through isolation) render such detection as fundamentally different from active
search detection strategies. In this work, through an active learning approach,
we design testing and isolation strategies to contain the spread and minimize
the cumulative infections under a given test budget. We prove that the
objective can be optimized, with performance guarantees, by greedily selecting
the nodes to test. We further design reward-based methodologies that
effectively minimize an upper bound on the cumulative infections and are
computationally more tractable in large networks. These policies, however, need
knowledge about the nodes' infection probabilities which are dynamically
changing and have to be learned by sequential testing. We develop a
message-passing framework for this purpose and, building on that, show novel
tradeoffs between exploitation of knowledge through reward-based heuristics and
exploration of the unknown through a carefully designed probabilistic testing.
The tradeoffs are fundamentally distinct from the classical counterparts under
active search or multi-armed bandit problems (MABs). We provably show the
necessity of exploration in a stylized network and show through simulations

terms of ensembles of networks that focus on individual characteristics. We
analyze the effect of different loss functions including a parameter loss to

reconstruction loss to enforce similar statistics of the image generated for
the estimated parameters in comparison to training images as well as an
additional regularization term to explicitly penalize deviations between latent

(exponential consensus for short) for identical agents with finite-dimensional
linear system dynamics over dynamic network topology. Our aim is to find the
weakest possible conditions that guarantee exponentially fast consensus using a
Lyapunov function consisting of a sum of terms of the same functional form. We
first investigate necessary conditions, starting by examining the system (both
agent and network) parameters. It is found that controllability of the linear
agents is necessary for reaching consensus. Then, to work out necessary
conditions incorporating the network topology, we construct a set of Laplacian
matrix-valued functions. The precompactness of this set of functions is shown
to be a significant generalization of existing assumptions on network topology,
including the common assumption that the edge weights are bounded piecewise
constant functions or continuous functions. With the aid of such a
precompactness assumption and restricting the Lyapunov function to one
consisting of a sum of terms of the same functional form, we prove that a joint
$(\delta, T)$-connectivity condition on the network topology is necessary for
exponential consensus. Finally, we investigate how the above two
``necessities'' work together to guarantee exponential consensus. To partially
address this problem, we define a synchronization index to characterize the
interplay between agent parameters and network topology. Based on this notion,
it is shown that by designing a proper feedback matrix and under the
precompactness assumption, exponential consensus can be reached globally and
uniformly if the joint $(\delta,T)$-connectivity and controllability conditions
are satisfied, and the synchronization index is not less than one.

response, which fundamentally limits its spatial and temporal specificity. In
mice, the Direct Imaging of Neuronal Activity (DIANA) method revealed MRI
signals that correlated with intracellular voltage changes, showing high
spatial and temporal specificity. In this work we attempted DIANA in humans.
Four visual paradigms were tested, exploring different stimulus types
(flickering noise patterns, and naturalistic images) and stimulus durations
(50-200ms). Regions of interest (ROI) were derived from traditional fMRI
acquisitions and anatomical scans. When using small manually drawn ROI, signals
were detected that resembled possible functional activity. However, increasing
the stimulus duration did not lead to corroborating signal changes. Moreover,
these signals disappeared when averaged over larger functionally or
anatomically derived ROI. Further analysis of the data highlighted, DIANA's
sensitivity to inflow effects and subject motion. Therefore, care should be
taken not to mistake artifacts for neuronal activity. Although we did not yet
observe clear DIANA signals in humans, it is possible that a higher spatial
resolution is needed to separate signals with opposite signs in different
laminar compartments. However, obtaining such data may be particularly
challenging because repetitive experiments with short interstimulus intervals
can be strenuous for the subjects. To obtain better data, improvements in
sequence and stimulus designs are needed to maximize the DIANA signal and
minimize confounds. However, without a clear understanding of DIANA's
biophysical underpinnings it is difficult to do so. Therefore, it may be more
effective to first study DIANA's biophysical underpinnings in a controlled, yet
biologically revenant, setting.

optimal tuning). However, recent studies showed that attention is often tuned
to the relative feature of the search target (e.g., redder), so that all items
that match the relative features of the target equally attract attention (e.g.,
all redder items; relational account). Optimal tuning was shown to occur only
at a later stage of identifying the target. However, the evidence for this
division mainly relied on eye tracking studies that assessed the first eye
movements. The present study tested whether this division can also be observed
when the task is completed with covert attention and without moving the eyes.
We used the N2pc in the EEG of participants to assess covert attention, and
found comparable results: Attention was initially tuned to the relative colour
of the target, as shown by a significantly larger N2pc to relatively matching
distractors than a target-coloured distractor. However, in the response
accuracies, a slightly shifted, ""optimal"" distractor interfered most strongly
with target identification. These results confirm that early (covert) attention
is tuned to the relative properties of an item, in line with the relational
account, while later decision-making processes may be biased to optimal
features.

explainability are carefully designed. Then, we recruit about 3000 users with

generalize to unseen biological regimes. This protein field alone contains
enough information to yield accurate predictions even if forces themselves are

Hard Negative mining (HN) as the optimization objective. We find that
optimizing an ITM model using only the hard negative samples can easily lead to
gradient vanishing. In this paper, we derive the condition under which the
gradient vanishes during training. When the difference between the positive
pair similarity and the negative pair similarity is close to 0, the gradients
on both the image and text encoders will approach 0. To alleviate the gradient
vanishing problem, we propose a Selectively Hard Negative Mining (SelHN)
strategy, which chooses whether to mine hard negative samples according to the

ITM models to give them better training behavior. To further ensure the

However, enabling the RIS to modify the wireless channel requires careful
optimization of the RIS phase-shifts. Although discrete RIS is more practical
given hardware limitations, continuous RIS phase-shift optimization has
attracted significantly more attention than discrete RIS optimization, which
suffers from issues like quantization error and scalability. To overcome these
issues, we develop a comprehensive probabilistic technique to transform
discrete optimization problems into optimization problems of continuous domain
probability parameters by interpreting the discrete optimization variable as a
categorical random vector and computing expectations with respect to those
parameters. We rigorously establish that for the unconstrained case, the
optimal points of the reformulation and the original problem coincide. For the
constrained case, we prove that the transformed problem is a relaxation of the

applications. The former interpretation yields a stochastic sampling technique,
whereas the latter yields an analytical gradient descent (GD) approach that
employs closed-form approximations for the expectation. The numerical results

J2226+6057, J1908+0621, J1825-1326 and the suggested origin pulsars near the
sources have been published. In our previous work, we studied the hadronic
$\gamma$-ray spectra of the sources J2226+6057, J1908+0621, J1825-1326 in terms
of the Hertzian dipole model of pulsar. In this paper, we investigate the
possibility of the leptonic origin of the $\gamma$-ray. We use the Hertzian
dipole model to describe the pulsars around the sources. The electrons around
the pulsars can be accelerated to PeV by the electromagnetic fields of pulsars.
Under the assumption that the initial electrons are uniform distributed in a
spherical shell between $10^{7}$ to $10^{9}$m around the pulsar, we obtain the
energy distribution of electrons. The leptonic $\gamma$-ray spectra can be
calculated through inverse Compton scattering processes. The leptonic
$\gamma$-ray can roughly conform to the observation of LHAASO.

gas (2DEG), or in a conventional $s$-wave superconductor, can lead to a large
magnetoresistance even with one ferromagnet. However, such enhanced
magnetoresistance is not generic and can be nonmonotonic and change its sign
with Rashba SOC. For an in-plane rotation of magnetization, it is typically
negligibly small for a 2DEG and depends on the perfect transmission which
emerges from a spin-parity-time symmetry of the scattering states, while this
symmetry is generally absent from the Hamiltonian of the system. The key
difference from considering the normal-state magnetoresistance is the presence
of the spin-dependent Andreev reflection at superconducting interfaces. In the
fabricated junctions of quasi-2D van der Waals ferromagnets with conventional
$s$-wave superconductors (Fe$_{0.29}$TaS$_2$/NbN) we find another example of
enhanced magnetoresistance where the presence of Rashba SOC reduces the
effective interfacial strength and is responsible for an equal-spin Andreev
reflection. The observed nonmonotonic trend in the out-of-plane
magnetoresistance with the interfacial barrier is an evidence for the
proximity-induced equal-spin-triplet superconductivity.

primary substation, that occurs when generation from solar panels in the local
grid exceeds consumption, and b) shave the system wide peak demand, that
typically occurs during the hours of late afternoon. Regarding the clustering
stage, three popular machine learning algorithms for electrical load clustering
are employed -namely k-means, k-medoids and an agglomerative hierarchical
clustering- alongside two different distance measures -namely euclidean and
constrained dynamic time warping (DTW). We evaluate the methods using multiple
validation metrics including a novel metric -namely peak performance score
(PPS)- that we propose in the context of this study. The best model is employed
to divide daily prosumer load profiles into clusters and each cluster is
analyzed in terms of load shape, mean entropy, and load type distribution.
These characteristics are then used to distinguish the clusters that have the
potential to serve the optimization objectives by matching them to appropriate
DR schemes including time of use (TOU), critical peak pricing (CPP), and
real-time pricing (RTP). The results of this study can be useful for network
operators, utilities, and aggregators that aim to develop targeted DR programs

physical systems. These techniques offer high expressive power and good
generalizability for interpolation within observed data sets. However, the
disadvantage of black-box models is that they underperform under blind
conditions since no physical knowledge is incorporated. Physics-based ML aims
to address this problem by retaining the mathematical flexibility of ML
techniques while incorporating physics. In accord, this paper proposes to embed
mechanics-based models into the mean function of a Gaussian Process (GP) model
and characterize potential discrepancies through kernel machines. A specific
class of kernel function is promoted, which has a connection with the gradient
of the physics-based model with respect to the input and parameters and shares
similarity with the exact Autocovariance function of linear dynamical systems.
The spectral properties of the kernel function enable considering dominant
periodic processes originating from physics misspecification. Nevertheless, the
stationarity of the kernel function is a difficult hurdle in the sequential
processing of long data sets, resolved through hierarchical Bayesian
techniques. This implementation is also advantageous to mitigate computational
costs, alleviating the scalability of GPs when dealing with sequential data.
Using numerical and experimental examples, potential applications of the
proposed method to structural dynamics inverse problems are demonstrated.

that different people may express the same expression in very different ways.
However, most FER methods still use one-hot or soft labels as the supervision,
which lack sufficient semantic descriptions of facial expressions and are less

Therefore, in this work, we propose CLIPER, a unified framework for both static

multiple expression text descriptors (METD) to learn fine-grained expression

outer wind originated 400 Myr ago (Episode I; R_I = 20-50 kpc) and the fast,
inner wind is 7 Myr old (Episode II; R_II = 0-20 kpc). While this wind contains
ionized, neutral, and molecular gas, the physical state and mass of the most
extended phase--the warm, ionized gas--is unknown. Here we present Keck optical
spectra of the Makani outflow. These allow us to detect hydrogen lines out to r
= 30-40 kpc and thus constrain the mass, momentum, and energy in the wind. Many
collisionally-excited lines are detected throughout the wind, and their line
ratios are consistent with 200-400 km/s shocks that power the ionized gas, with
v_shock = $\sigma$_wind. Combining shock models, density-sensitive line ratios,
and mass and velocity measurements, we estimate that the ionized mass and
outflow rate in the Episode II wind could be as high as that of the molecular
gas: M_II(HII) ~ M_II(H_2) = (1-2)x10^9 Msun and dM/dt_II(HII) ~ dM/dt_II(H_2)

Msun/yr, but it contains more ionized gas: M_I(HII) = 5x10^9 Msun. The momentum
and energy in the recent Episode II wind imply a momentum-driven flow (p
``boost"" ~ 7) driven by the hot ejecta and radiation pressure from the
Eddington-limited, compact starburst. Much of the energy and momentum in the

analyzing, and understanding these microswimmer dynamics in a flow current, in
particular when incorporating the impact of the swimmer shape since the
equations contain a shape parameter as a single scalar, known as the Bretherton

achieved extensive success in multi-channel data representation and has
recently been extended to function representation such as Neural Networks with

theoretically affects the learning behavior of t-NNs. This paper is the first
to answer this question by deriving the upper bounds of the generalization
error of both standard and adversarially trained t-NNs. It reveals that the
t-NNs compressed by exact transformed low-rank parameterization can achieve a
sharper adversarial generalization bound. In practice, although t-NNs rarely
have exactly transformed low-rank weights, our analysis further shows that by
adversarial training with gradient flow (GF), the over-parameterized t-NNs with
ReLU activations are trained with implicit regularization towards transformed
low-rank parameterization under certain conditions. We also establish
adversarial generalization bounds for t-NNs with approximately transformed
low-rank weights. Our analysis indicates that the transformed low-rank

results in fixing real-world bugs. Despite the effectiveness, APR techniques
still face an overfitting problem: a generated patch can be incorrect although
it passes all tests. It is time-consuming to manually evaluate the correctness
of generated patches that can pass all tests. To address this problem, many
approaches have been proposed to automatically assess the correctness of
patches generated by APR techniques. However, existing approaches require a
large set of manually labeled patches as the training data. To mitigate the
issue, in this study, we propose PatchZero, the patch correctness assessment by
adopting large pre-trained models. Specifically, for patches generated by a new
or unseen APR tool, PatchZero does not need labeled patches of this new or
unseen APR tool for training (i.e., zero-shot) but directly queries the large
pre-trained model to get predictions on the correctness labels without
training. In this way, PatchZero can reduce the manual labeling effort when
building a model to automatically assess the correctness of generated patches
of new APR tools. To provide knowledge regarding the automatic patch
correctness assessment (APCA) task to the large pre-trained models, we also
design an instance-wise demonstration formation strategy by using contrastive
learning. Specifically, PatchZero selects semantically similar patches to help
the large pre-trained model to give more accurate predictions on the unlabeled
patches. Our experimental results showed that PatchZero can achieve an accuracy
of 82.7% and an F1-score of 86.0% on average although no labeled patch of the
new or unseen APR tool is available. In addition, our proposed technique
outperformed the prior state-of-the-art by a large margin.

Coordination within the k-group uses selective fast and cheap mechanisms rather

traders to programmatically exchange one asset for another. Such trades are
enabled by the assets deposited by liquidity providers (LPs). The goal of this
paper is to characterize and interpret the optimal (i.e., profit-maximizing)
strategy of a monopolist liquidity provider, as a function of that LP's beliefs
about asset prices and trader behavior.
  We introduce a general framework for reasoning about AMMs. In this model, the
market maker (i.e., LP) chooses a demand curve that specifies the quantity of a
risky asset (such as BTC or ETH) to be held at each dollar price. Traders
arrive sequentially and submit a price bid that can be interpreted as their
estimate of the risky asset price; the AMM responds to this submitted bid with
an allocation of the risky asset to the trader, a payment that the trader must
pay, and a revised internal estimate for the true asset price. We define an
incentive-compatible (IC) AMM as one in which a trader's optimal strategy is to
submit its true estimate of the asset price, and characterize the IC AMMs as
those with downward-sloping demand curves and payments defined by a formula
familiar from Myerson's optimal auction theory. We characterize the
profit-maximizing IC AMM via a generalization of Myerson's virtual values. The
optimal demand curve generally has a jump that can be interpreted as a ""bid-ask
spread,"" which we show is caused by a combination of adverse selection risk
(dominant when the degree of information asymmetry is large) and monopoly
pricing (dominant when asymmetry is small).

works continued that research direction and showed that for a large collection
of classical learning tasks, either super-linear classical memory size or
super-polynomially many samples are needed. However, these results do not
capture all physical computational models, remarkably, quantum computers and
the use of quantum memory. It leaves the possibility that a small piece of
quantum memory could significantly reduce the need for classical memory or
samples and thus completely change the nature of the classical learning task.
  In this work, we prove that any quantum algorithm with both, classical memory
and quantum memory, for parity learning on $n$ bits, requires either
$\Omega(n^2)$ bits of classical memory or $\Omega(n)$ bits of quantum memory or
an exponential number of samples. In other words, the memory-sample lower bound
for parity learning remains qualitatively the same, even if the learning
algorithm can use, in addition to the classical memory, a quantum memory of
size $c n$ (for some constant $c>0$).
  Our results refute the possibility that a small amount of quantum memory
significantly reduces the size of classical memory needed for efficient
learning on these problems. Our results also imply improved security of several
existing cryptographical protocols in the bounded-storage model (protocols that
are based on parity learning on $n$ bits), proving that security holds even in

evolve into positive differential conductance dips; and meanwhile they move
away from the superconducting gap towards high bias voltage, and disappear
eventually. In addition, with the increase of magnetic field, the NDCs/dips
follow the evolution of the superconducting gap, and disappear when the gap

machine learning model, has become the pillar of many backdoor detection and
defense methods. Previous works on backdoor inversion often recover the
backdoor through an optimization process to flip a support set of clean images
into the target class. However, it is rarely studied and understood how large
this support set should be to recover a successful backdoor. In this work, we
show that one can reliably recover the backdoor trigger with as few as a single
image. Specifically, we propose the SmoothInv method, which first constructs a
robust smoothed version of the backdoored classifier and then performs guided
image synthesis towards the target class to reveal the backdoor pattern.
SmoothInv requires neither an explicit modeling of the backdoor via a mask
variable, nor any complex regularization schemes, which has become the standard
practice in backdoor inversion methods. We perform both quantitaive and
qualitative study on backdoored classifiers from previous published backdoor
attacks. We demonstrate that compared to existing methods, SmoothInv is able to
recover successful backdoors from single images, while maintaining high
fidelity to the original backdoor. We also show how we identify the target
backdoored class from the backdoored classifier. Last, we propose and analyze
two countermeasures to our approach and show that SmoothInv remains robust in

sampling, but many particles are still needed to be used for solving the 3D
localization problem even if INS is available. In particular, huge number of
particles are necessary if INS is not available and it makes infeasible to
perform 3D MCL in terms of the computational cost. Scan matching (SM), that is
optimization-based localization, efficiently works even though INS is not
available because SM can ignore movement constraints of a robot and/or device
in its optimization process. However, SM sometimes determines an infeasible
estimate against movement. We consider that MCL and SM have complemental
advantages and disadvantages and propose a fusion method of MCL and SM. Because
SM is considered as optimization of a measurement model in terms of the
probabilistic modeling, we perform measurement model optimization as SM. The
optimization result is then used to approximate the measurement model
distribution and the approximated distribution is used to sample particles. The
sampled particles are fused with MCL via importance sampling. As a result, the
advantages of MCL and SM can be simultaneously utilized while mitigating their
disadvantages. Experiments are conducted on the KITTI dataset and other two

Here we present an investigation into the underlying cause using serendipitous
survey detections as well as targeted observations. We find that the detection
of the activity is caused by an extremely faint coma being enhanced by forward
scattering effect due to the comet reaching a phase angle of $\sim140^\circ$.
The coma morphology is consistent with sustained, sublimation-driven activity
produced by a small active area, $\sim700~\mathrm{m^2}$, one of the smallest
values ever measured on a comet. The phase function of the nucleus shows a
phase coefficient of $0.035\pm0.002~\mathrm{mag/deg}$, implying an absolute
magnitude of $H=18.31\pm0.04$ and a phase slope of $G=-0.13$, with color
consistent with typical JFC nuclei. Thermal observations suggest a nucleus
diameter of 0.6--1.1~km, implying an optical albedo of 0.04--0.23 which is
higher than typical cometary nuclei. An unsuccessful search for dust trail and
meteor activity confirms minimal dust deposit along the orbit, totaling
$\lesssim10^8$~kg. As P/2021 HS is dynamically unstable, similar to typical
JFCs, we speculate that it has an origin in the trans-Neptunian region, and
that its extreme depletion of volatiles is caused by a large number of previous
passages to the inner Solar System. The dramatic discovery of the cometary
nature of P/2021 HS highlights the challenges of detecting comets with
extremely low activity levels. Observations at high phase angle where forward
scattering is pronounced will help identify such comets.

population can be different from that of the individual player at some mean

games. It is well known that, without any monotonicity conditions, mean field
games typically contain multiple mean field equilibria and the wellposedness of
their corresponding master equations fails. In this paper, a partial order for
the set of probability measure flows is proposed to compare different mean
field equilibria. The minimal and maximal mean field equilibria under this
partial order are constructed and satisfy the flow property. The corresponding
value functions, however, are in general discontinuous. We thus introduce a
notion of weak-viscosity solutions for the master equation and verify that the
value functions are indeed weak-viscosity solutions. Moreover, a comparison
principle for weak-viscosity semi-solutions is established and thus these two
value functions serve as the minimal and maximal weak-viscosity solutions in
appropriate sense. In particular, when these two value functions coincide, the
value function becomes the unique weak-viscosity solution to the master

possibility of acquiring multiple omics data from individual cells, thereby
enabling a deeper understanding of cellular states and dynamics. Nevertheless,
the proliferation of multimodal single-cell data also introduces tremendous
challenges in modeling the complex interactions among different modalities. The
recently advanced methods focus on constructing static interaction graphs and
applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn from multimodal data. However,
such static graphs can be suboptimal as they do not take advantage of the
downstream task information; meanwhile GNNs also have some inherent limitations
when deeply stacking GNN layers. To tackle these issues, in this work, we
investigate how to leverage transformers for multimodal single-cell data in an
end-to-end manner while exploiting downstream task information. In particular,
we propose a scMoFormer framework which can readily incorporate external domain
knowledge and model the interactions within each modality and cross modalities.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that scMoFormer achieves superior performance
on various benchmark datasets. Note that scMoFormer won a Kaggle silver medal
with the rank of $24\ /\ 1221$ (Top 2%) without ensemble in a NeurIPS 2022

its capability in 3D surface reconstruction. However, as the nature of
per-scene optimization is based on the volumetric rendering of color, previous
neural implicit surface reconstruction methods usually fail in low-textured
regions, including the floors, walls, etc., which commonly exist for indoor
scenes. Being aware of the fact that these low-textured regions usually
correspond to planes, without introducing additional ground-truth supervisory
signals or making additional assumptions about the room layout, we propose to
leverage a novel Pseudo Plane-regularized Signed Distance Field (P$^2$SDF) for
indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we consider adjacent pixels with
similar colors to be on the same pseudo planes. The plane parameters are then
estimated on the fly during training by an efficient and effective two-step
scheme. Then the signed distances of the points on the planes are regularized
by the estimated plane parameters in the training phase. As the unsupervised
plane segments are usually noisy and inaccurate, we propose to assign different
weights to the sampled points on the plane in plane estimation as well as the
regularization loss. The weights come by fusing the plane segments from
different views. As the sampled rays in the planar regions are redundant,
leading to inefficient training, we further propose a keypoint-guided rays
sampling strategy that attends to the informative textured regions with large
color variations, and the implicit network gets a better reconstruction,
compared with the original uniform ray sampling strategy. Experiments show that
our P$^2$SDF achieves competitive reconstruction performance in Manhattan
scenes. Further, as we do not introduce any additional room layout assumption,
our P$^2$SDF generalizes well to the reconstruction of non-Manhattan scenes.

then present computational experiments with monoidal strengthening of cuts from

Computational approaches based on machine learning enable the rapid screening

and used advanced machine learning predictors of binding affinity that fuse the
gradient boosting decision tree algorithm with two natural language processing

these predictors, we systematically analyzed the binding affinities of DrugBank

were further analyzed for ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism,

several works have attempted to address these issues, which ignored the complex
association of items across several sequences. Along this line, with the aim of
learning representative item embedding to alleviate this dilemma, we propose
GUESR, from the view of graph contrastive learning. Specifically, we first

terms of the internal design logic, existing CAM-based approaches often
overlook the causal perspective that answers the core ""why"" question to help

the consideration of both necessity and sufficiency, two complementary sides of
a desirable explanation. This paper presents a causality-driven framework,
SUNY, designed to rationalize the explanations toward better human
understanding. Using the CNN model's input features or internal filters as
hypothetical causes, SUNY generates explanations by bi-directional
quantifications on both the necessary and sufficient perspectives. Extensive
evaluations justify that SUNY not only produces more informative and convincing
explanations from the angles of necessity and sufficiency, but also achieves
performances competitive to other approaches across different CNN architectures
over large-scale datasets, including ILSVRC2012 and CUB-200-2011.

generator is an indispensable component to control lasers and then manipulate
atoms. We developed a highly compact RF generator for fast switching and
sweeping frequencies/amplitudes of atomic interference pulse sequences.
Multi-channel RF signals are generated by using a field-programmable gate array
(FPGA) to control eight direct digital synthesizers (DDSs). We further proposed
and demonstrated a method of preloading the parameters of all RF pulse
sequences to the DDS registers before the execution of the pulse sequences,
which eliminates the data transfer between the FPGA and DDSs to change RF
signals and thus sharply shortens the delay of frequency switching when the
pulse sequences are running. The characterized performance shows the generated
RF signals achieve 119 ns frequency switching delay, and 40 dB harmonic
rejection ratio. The generated RF pulse sequences are applied to a cold
atom-interferometer gyroscope, and the contrast of atomic interference fringes
reaches 38%. This compact multi-channel generator with the fast

spacetime cannot be extended to the past beyond some boundary $\mathcal{B}$.
Therefore, the inflationary universe must have had some kind of beginning.
However, the BGW theorem says nothing about the boundary conditions on
$\mathcal{B}$, or even about its location. Here we present a single-scalar
field model of the Two-Measures Theory, where the non-Riemannian volume element
$\Upsilon d^4x$ is present in the action. As a result of the model dynamics, an
upper bound $\varphi_0$ of admissible values of the scalar field $\varphi$
appears, which sets the position of $\mathcal{B}$ in the form of a spacelike
hypersurface $\Upsilon(x)=0$ with a boundary condition: $\Upsilon\rightarrow
0^+$ as $\varphi\rightarrow\varphi_0^{\,\,\,-}$. A detailed study has
established that if the initial kinetic energy density $\rho_{kin}^{(in)}$
prevails over initial gradient energy density $\rho_{grad}^{(in)}$ then there
is an interval of initial values $\varphi_{in}^{(min)}\leq \varphi_{in}
<\varphi_0$, where $\rho_{kin}^{(in)}$ and $\rho_{grad}^{(in)}$ cannot exceed
the potential energy density and hence the initial conditions necessary for the
onset of inflation are satisfied. It is shown that under almost all possible
left-handed boundary conditions on $\mathcal{B}$, that is where
$\Upsilon\rightarrow 0^-$, the metric tensor in the Einstein frame has a jump
discontinuity on $\mathcal{B}$, so the Christoffel connection coefficients are
not defined on the spacelike hypersurface $\Upsilon=0$. Thus, if
$\varphi_{in}^{(min)}\leq \varphi_{in}<\varphi_0$ and
$\rho_{kin}^{(in)}>\rho_{grad}^{(in)}$, then there was an inflationary stage in
the history of our Universe and the congruence of timelike geodesics cannot be
extended to the past beyond the hypersurface $\Upsilon=0$.

planted $q$-coloring in $G(n,1/2)$, and finding efficiently verifiable
witnesses of non-$q$-colorability (a.k.a. refutations) in $G(n,1/2)$. Our main
results show hardness for both these problems in a restricted-but-powerful
class of algorithms based on computing low-degree polynomials in the inputs.
  The problem of recovering a planted $q$-coloring is equivalent to recovering
$q$ disjoint planted cliques that cover all the vertices -- a potentially
easier variant of the well-studied planted clique problem. Our first result
shows that this variant is as hard as the original planted clique problem in
the low-degree polynomial model of computation: each clique needs to have size
$k \gg \sqrt{n}$ for efficient recovery to be possible. For the related variant
where the cliques cover a $(1-\epsilon)$-fraction of the vertices, we also show
hardness by reduction from planted clique.
  Our second result shows that refuting $q$-colorability of $G(n,1/2)$ is hard
in the low-degree polynomial model when $q \gg n^{2/3}$ but easy when $q
\lesssim n^{1/2}$, and we leave closing this gap for future work. Our proof is
more subtle than similar results for planted clique and involves constructing a
non-standard distribution over $q$-colorable graphs. We note that while related
to several prior works, this is the first work that explicitly formulates
refutation problems in the low-degree polynomial model.
  The proofs of our main results involve showing low-degree hardness of
hypothesis testing between an appropriately constructed pair of distributions.
For refutation, we show completeness of this approach: in the low-degree model,
the refutation task is precisely as hard as the hardest associated testing
problem, i.e., proving hardness of refutation amounts to finding a ""hard""
distribution.

class of slice hyperholomorphic functions; their Cauchy formula allows to
define the so-called $S$-functional calculus for noncommuting operators based
on the $S$-spectrum. In the second step this extension procedure generates
monogenic functions; the related monogenic functional calculus, based on the
monogenic spectrum, contains the Weyl functional calculus as a particular case.
In this paper we show that the extension operator from slice hyperholomorphic
functions to monogenic functions admits various possible factorizations that
induce different function spaces. The integral representations in such spaces
allows to define the associated functional calculi based on the $S$-spectrum.
The function spaces and the associated functional calculi define the so called

Collage Diffusion learns specialized text representations per layer. Collage

  Xie","Distance-based Weight Transfer from Near-field to Far-field Speaker
  Verification",,,,,"cs.SD eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The scarcity of labeled far-field speech is a constraint for training
superior far-field speaker verification systems. Fine-tuning the model
pre-trained on large-scale near-field speech substantially outperforms training
from scratch. However, the fine-tuning method suffers from two
limitations--catastrophic forgetting and overfitting. In this paper, we propose
a weight transfer regularization(WTR) loss to constrain the distance of the
weights between the pre-trained model with large-scale near-field speech and
the fine-tuned model through a small number of far-field speech. With the WTR
loss, the fine-tuning process takes advantage of the previously acquired
discriminative ability from the large-scale near-field speech without
catastrophic forgetting. Meanwhile, we use the PAC-Bayes generalization theory
to analyze the generalization bound of the fine-tuned model with the WTR loss.
The analysis result indicates that the WTR term makes the fine-tuned model have
a tighter generalization upper bound. Moreover, we explore three kinds of norm
distance for weight transfer, which are L1-norm distance, L2-norm distance and
Max-norm distance. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the WTR loss on
VoxCeleb (pre-trained dataset) and FFSVC (fine-tuned dataset) datasets.

enabling a large number of applications for the benefit of mankind.
Advancements in embedded system technology and compressed IPv6 have enabled the
support of IP stack in resource constrained heterogeneous smart devices.
However, global connectivity and resource constrained characteristics of smart
devices have exposed them to different insider and outsider attacks, which put
users' security and privacy at risk. Various risks associated with IoT slow
down its growth and become an obstruction in the worldwide adoption of its
applications. In RFC 6550, the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy
Network (RPL) is specified by IETF's ROLL working group for facilitating
efficient routing in 6LoWPAN networks, while considering its limitations. Due
to resource constrained nature of nodes in the IoT, RPL is vulnerable to many
attacks that consume the node's resources and degrade the network's
performance. In this paper, we present a study on various attacks and their
existing defense solutions, particularly to RPL. Open research issues,
challenges, and future directions specific to RPL security are also discussed.
A taxonomy of RPL attacks, considering the essential attributes like resources,
topology, and traffic, is shown for better understanding. In addition, a study
of existing cross-layered and RPL specific network layer based defense
solutions suggested in the literature is also carried out.

numerical tests are conducted for low Reynolds numbers of 100 to 500 based on
the louver pitch with different fin pitches and fin louver angles. The
steady-state velocity profiles, temperature, and pressure fields are studied in
detail. The heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop data are reported in
terms of Colburn j-factor and Fanning friction factor f, and the volume
goodness factor to get a performance comparison for FLiBe as the coolant in a
Molten Salt Reactor. As regards findings of the analyses, when the louver angle
steeps, the molten salt flow becomes more louvered direct which improves the
interaction and heat transfer between the fin and molten salt. On the contrary,
when the fin pitches increase, the flow becomes duct-directed that reducing the

involving long-range hopping that can hold multiple topological phases. Using
winding number diagrams to characterize the system's topological phases
geometrically, it is shown that there can be multiple winding number transition
paths for a quench between two topological phases. The dependence of the quench
dynamics is studied in terms of the survival probability of the fermionic edge
modes and post-quench transport. For two quench paths between two topological
regimes with the same initial and final topological phase, the survival
probability of edge states is shown to be strongly dependent on the winding
number transition path. This dependence is explained using energy band diagrams
corresponding to the paths. Following this, the effect of the winding number
transition path on transport is investigated. We find that the velocities of
maximum transport channels varied along the winding number transition path.
This variation depends on the path we choose, i.e., it increases or decreases
depending upon the path. An analysis of the coefficient maps, energy spectrum,
and spatial structure of the edge states of the final quench Hamiltonian
provides an understanding of the path-dependent velocity variation phenomenon.

  Laser Powder Bed Fusion",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) holds promise to efficiently produce metal
parts. However, LPBF incurs stochastic melt pool (MP) spattering, which would
roughen workpiece in-process surface, thus weakening inter-layer bonding and
causing issues like porosity, powder contamination, and recoater intervention.
Understanding the consequential effect of MP spattering on layer surface
remains difficult due to the lack of process monitoring capability for
concurrently tracking MP spatters and characterizing layer surfaces. In this
work, using our lab-designed LPBF-specific fringe projection profilometry and
an off-axis camera, we quantify the correlation between MP spattering and
in-process layer surface roughness for the first time to reveal the influence
of MP spatters on process anomaly and part defects. A method of extracting and
registering MP spattering metrics is developed by machine learning of the
in-situ imaging data. Each image is analyzed to obtain the MP center location
and the spatter count and ejection angle. These MP spatter signatures are
registered for each monitored MP across each layer. Regression modeling is used
to correlate registered MP spatter signature and its processing parameters with
layer surface topography measured by the in-situ FPP. We find that the attained
MP spatter feature profile can help predict the layer surface roughness more
accurately (> 50% less error), in contrast to the conventional approaches that
would only use nominal process setting. This is because the spatter information
can reflect key process changes including the deviations in actual laser scan
parameters and their effects. The results corroborate the importance of spatter
monitoring and the distinct influence of spattering on layer surface roughness.
Our work paves a foundation to thoroughly elucidate and effectively control the
role of MP spattering in defect formation during LPBF.

CVR suffers from well-known Sample Selection Bias (SSB) and Data Sparsity (DS)
problems. Although existing methods ESMM and ESM2 train with all impression
samples over the entire space by modeling user behavior paths, SSB and DS
problems still exist. In real practice, the online inference space are samples

existing methods. Moreover, existing methods solve the DS problem mainly by
building behavior paths of their own specific scene, ignoring the behaviors in

well-defined limit in the case of linear drag. This limiting eccentricity
vector defines a conserved quantity, and in the present paper, we prove that
the corresponding invariant sets are smooth manifolds. These results rely on
normal form theory and a blowup transformation, which reveals that the
invariant manifolds are (nonhyperbolic) stable sets of (limiting) periodic
orbits. Moreover, we identify a separate invariant manifold which corresponds
to a zero limiting eccentricity vector. This manifold is obtained as a
generalized center manifold over the zero eigenspace of a zero-Hopf point.
Finally, we present a detailed blowup analysis, which provides a geometric
picture of the dynamics. %We will use this to shed light on a degenerate case
of the limiting eccentricity vector. %The aforementioned invariant manifolds
only make up a subset hereof. We believe that our approach and results will

bring risks to real-world applications. The sparse attack is an important task
which, compared with the popular adversarial perturbation on the whole image,
needs to select the potential pixels that is generally regularized by an
$\ell_0$-norm constraint, and simultaneously optimize the corresponding
texture. The non-differentiability of $\ell_0$ norm brings challenges and many
works on attacking object detection adopted manually-designed patterns to
address them, which are meaningless and independent of objects, and therefore
lead to relatively poor attack performance.
  In this paper, we propose Adversarial Semantic Contour (ASC), an MAP estimate
of a Bayesian formulation of sparse attack with a deceived prior of object
contour. The object contour prior effectively reduces the search space of pixel
selection and improves the attack by introducing more semantic bias. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ASC can corrupt the prediction of 9 modern
detectors with different architectures (\e.g., one-stage, two-stage and
Transformer) by modifying fewer than 5\% of the pixels of the object area in
COCO in white-box scenario and around 10\% of those in black-box scenario. We
further extend the attack to datasets for autonomous driving systems to verify
the effectiveness. We conclude with cautions about contour being the common
weakness of object detectors with various architecture and the care needed in
applying them in safety-sensitive scenarios.

  Functions",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge graph embedding models (KGEMs) are used for various tasks related
to knowledge graphs (KGs), including link prediction. They are trained with
loss functions that are computed considering a batch of scored triples and
their corresponding labels. Traditional approaches consider the label of a
triple to be either true or false. However, recent works suggest that all
negative triples should not be valued equally. In line with this recent
assumption, we posit that semantically valid negative triples might be
high-quality negative triples. As such, loss functions should treat them
differently from semantically invalid negative ones. To this aim, we propose
semantic-driven versions for the three main loss functions for link prediction.
In particular, we treat the scores of negative triples differently by injecting
background knowledge about relation domains and ranges into the loss functions.
In an extensive and controlled experimental setting, we show that the proposed
loss functions systematically provide satisfying results on three public
benchmark KGs underpinned with different schemas, which demonstrates both the
generality and superiority of our proposed approach. In fact, the proposed loss
functions do (1) lead to better MRR and Hits@$10$ values, (2) drive KGEMs
towards better semantic awareness. This highlights that semantic information
globally improves KGEMs, and thus should be incorporated into loss functions.
Domains and ranges of relations being largely available in schema-defined KGs,
this makes our approach both beneficial and widely usable in practice.

recently been shown to host a colossal angular magnetoresistance as the spin
orientation is rotated from the in- to out-of-plane direction, proposed to be
underpinned by a topological nodal-line degeneracy in its electronic structure.
Nonetheless, the origins of its ferrimagnetic structure remain controversial,
while its experimental electronic structure, and the role of correlations in
shaping this, are little explored to date. Here, we combine x-ray and
photoemission-based spectroscopies with first-principles calculations, to probe
the elemental-selective electronic structure and magnetic order in
Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$. Through these, we identify a marked Mn-Te hybridisation,
which weakens the electronic correlations and enhances the magnetic anisotropy.
We demonstrate how this strengthens the magnetic frustration in
Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$, which is key to stabilising its ferrimagnetic order, and
find a crucial role of both exchange interactions extending beyond
nearest-neighbours and anti-symmetric exchange in dictating its ordering
temperature. Together, our results demonstrate a powerful methodology of using
experimental electronic structure probes to constrain the parameter space for
first-principles calculations of magnetic materials, and through this approach,
reveal a pivotal role played by covalency in stabilising the ferrimagnetic
order in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$.

fundamental task in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) to enable
robot relocalization and loop closure detection. In topological SLAM the
recognition takes place by comparing a signature (or feature vector) associated
to the current node with the signatures of the nodes in the known map. However,
as the number of nodes increases, matching the current node signature against
all the existing ones becomes inefficient and thwarts real-time navigation. In
this paper we propose a novel approach to pre-select a subset of map nodes for
place recognition. The map nodes are clustered during exploration and each
cluster is associated with a region. The region labels become the prediction
targets of a deep neural network and, during navigation, only the nodes
associated with the regions predicted with high probability are considered for
matching. While the proposed technique can be integrated in different SLAM
approaches, in this work we describe an effective integration with RTAB-Map (a
popular framework for real-time topological SLAM) which allowed us to design
and run several experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness. All the code and

  with independent tokens","17 pages, 12 figures. ICLR 2023 (spotlight)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present a novel method to estimate 3D human pose and shape
from monocular videos. This task requires directly recovering pixel-alignment
3D human pose and body shape from monocular images or videos, which is
challenging due to its inherent ambiguity. To improve precision, existing
methods highly rely on the initialized mean pose and shape as prior estimates
and parameter regression with an iterative error feedback manner. In addition,
video-based approaches model the overall change over the image-level features
to temporally enhance the single-frame feature, but fail to capture the
rotational motion at the joint level, and cannot guarantee local temporal
consistency. To address these issues, we propose a novel Transformer-based
model with a design of independent tokens. First, we introduce three types of
tokens independent of the image feature: \textit{joint rotation tokens, shape
token, and camera token}. By progressively interacting with image features
through Transformer layers, these tokens learn to encode the prior knowledge of
human 3D joint rotations, body shape, and position information from large-scale
data, and are updated to estimate SMPL parameters conditioned on a given image.
Second, benefiting from the proposed token-based representation, we further use
a temporal model to focus on capturing the rotational temporal information of
each joint, which is empirically conducive to preventing large jitters in local
parts. Despite being conceptually simple, the proposed method attains superior
performances on the 3DPW and Human3.6M datasets. Using ResNet-50 and
Transformer architectures, it obtains 42.0 mm error on the PA-MPJPE metric of
the challenging 3DPW, outperforming state-of-the-art counterparts by a large

our previous work that modeled the dynamic power consumption of RISs, we
henceforth concentrate more on static power consumption. We first divide the
RIS hardware into three basic parts: the FPGA control board, the drive

investigated and the last part has been modeled as the dynamic power

diode-/Varactor diode-/RF switch-based RIS. Finally, the measurement results

without uploading raw data for privacy preservation. This feature, i.e., the
inability to review participants' datasets, has recently been found responsible
for federated learning's vulnerability in the face of backdoor attacks.
Existing defense methods fall short from two perspectives: 1) they consider
only very specific and limited attacker models and unable to cope with advanced
backdoor attacks, such as distributed backdoor attacks, which break down the
global trigger into multiple distributed triggers. 2) they conduct detection
based on model granularity thus the performance gets impacted by the model

the complete model details and effectively detect potential backdoor models

bugs requires a considerable amount of costs through complex operations. In
contrast, introducing bugs can be an effortless job, in that even a simple
mutation can easily break the Program Under Test (PUT). Existing research has
considered these two opposed activities largely separately, either trying to
automatically generate realistic patches to help developers, or to find
realistic bugs to simulate and prevent future defects. Despite the fundamental
differences between them, however, we hypothesise that they do not
syntactically differ from each other when considered simply as code changes. To
examine this assumption systematically, we investigate the relationship between
patches and buggy commits, both generated manually and automatically, using a
clustering and pattern analysis. A large scale empirical evaluation reveals
that up to 70% of patches and faults can be clustered together based on the
similarity between their lexical patterns; further, 44% of the code changes can
be abstracted into the identical change patterns. Moreover, we investigate
whether code mutation tools can be used as Automated Program Repair (APR)
tools, and APR tools as code mutation tools. In both cases, the inverted use of
mutation and APR tools can perform surprisingly well, or even better, when
compared to their original, intended uses. For example, 89% of patches found by
SequenceR, a deep learning based APR tool, can also be found by its inversion,
i.e., a model trained with faults and not patches. Similarly, real fault
coupling study of mutants reveals that TBar, a template based APR tool, can
generate 14% and 3% more fault couplings than traditional mutation tools, PIT
and Major respectively, when used as a mutation tool.

image rendering given a camera pose. The recorded latent codes implicitly
contain visual information about the environment, which makes the RNR-Map
visually descriptive. This visual information in RNR-Map can be a useful
guideline for visual localization and navigation. We develop localization and
navigation frameworks that can effectively utilize the RNR-Map. We evaluate the
proposed frameworks on camera tracking, visual localization, and image-goal
navigation. Experimental results show that the RNR-Map-based localization
framework can find the target location based on a single query image with fast
speed and competitive accuracy compared to other baselines. Also, this
localization framework is robust to environmental changes, and even finds the
most visually similar places when a query image from a different environment is
given. The proposed navigation framework outperforms the existing image-goal

procedure. To avoid the numerical issue related to the non-differentiable
energy barrier function across the transition point, the austenite-martensite
transition energy barrier in PFM is constructed as a smooth function of
temperature. Both the indirect method using isothermal PFM with Maxwell
relations and the direct method using non-isothermal PFM are applied to
calculate the elastocaloric properties. The former is capable of calculating
both isothermal entropy change and adiabatic temperature change ($\Delta
T_{\text{ad}}$), but induces high computation cost. The latter is
computationally efficient, but only yields $\Delta T_{\text{ad}}$. In a model
Mn-22Cu alloy, the maximum $\Delta T_{\text{ad}}$ ($\Delta

involves an equivariant generalisation of the distributional flat trace
appearing in Guillemin's formula. Our generalisation of Guillemin's formula

the equivariant Ruelle $\zeta$-function in several examples, including examples

it is important to ask explorative key-terms to quickly elicit the user's
potential interests in various domains to accelerate the convergence of user

tackle these issues, we first propose ``ConLinUCB"", a general framework for

We prove tighter regret upper bounds of our proposed algorithms. Particularly,
ConLinUCB-BS achieves a regret bound of $O(\sqrt{dT\log T})$, better than the
previous result $O(d\sqrt{T}\log T)$. Extensive experiments on synthetic and

developing self-supervised models for time series data, we argue that the
current methods are not sufficient to learn optimal time series representations
due to solely unidirectional encoding over sparse point-wise input units. In
this work, we propose TimeMAE, a novel self-supervised paradigm for learning
transferrable time series representations based on transformer networks. The
distinct characteristics of the TimeMAE lie in processing each time series into
a sequence of non-overlapping sub-series via window-slicing partitioning,
followed by random masking strategies over the semantic units of localized
sub-series. Such a simple yet effective setting can help us achieve the goal of
killing three birds with one stone, i.e., (1) learning enriched contextual
representations of time series with a bidirectional encoding scheme; (2)
increasing the information density of basic semantic units; (3) efficiently
encoding representations of time series using transformer networks.
Nevertheless, it is a non-trivial to perform reconstructing task over such a
novel formulated modeling paradigm. To solve the discrepancy issue incurred by
newly injected masked embeddings, we design a decoupled autoencoder
architecture, which learns the representations of visible (unmasked) positions
and masked ones with two different encoder modules, respectively. Furthermore,
we construct two types of informative targets to accomplish the corresponding
pretext tasks. One is to create a tokenizer module that assigns a codeword to
each masked region, allowing the masked codeword classification (MCC) task to

latency. Second, for variant degradations, we propose a pixel-level LUT fusion
strategy, where a set of LUT bases are built upon state-of-the-art SR networks
pre-trained on different degraded data, and those LUT bases are combined with
extracted weights from lightweight convolution modules to adaptively handle
dynamic degradations. Extensive experiments are conducted on a newly proposed
online video streaming dataset named LDV-WebRTC. All the results show that our
method significantly outperforms existing LUT-based methods and offers
competitive SR performance with faster speed compared to efficient CNN-based
methods. Accelerated with our parallel LUT inference, our proposed method can
even support online 720P video SR around 100 FPS.

increasing demand from governmental authorities to optimize traffic performance

address this challenge, and we leverage the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to develop an AI-integrated video analytics
framework, called TAU (Traffic Analysis from UAVs), for automated traffic
analytics and understanding. Unlike previous works on traffic video analytics,
we propose an automated object detection and tracking pipeline from video
processing to advanced traffic understanding using high-resolution UAV images.
TAU combines six main contributions. First, it proposes a pre-processing
algorithm to adapt the high-resolution UAV image as input to the object
detector without lowering the resolution. This ensures an excellent detection
accuracy from high-quality features, particularly the small size of detected
objects from UAV images. Second, it introduces an algorithm for recalibrating
the vehicle coordinates to ensure that vehicles are uniquely identified and
tracked across the multiple crops of the same frame. Third, it presents a speed
calculation algorithm based on accumulating information from successive frames.
Fourth, TAU counts the number of vehicles per traffic zone based on the Ray
Tracing algorithm. Fifth, TAU has a fully independent algorithm for crossroad
arbitration based on the data gathered from the different zones surrounding it.
Sixth, TAU introduces a set of algorithms for extracting twenty-four types of
insights from the raw data collected. The code is shared here:

telescope onboard the Insight hard X-ray modulation telescope (Insight-HXMT)
satellite. It has 1728 Si-PIN pixels readout using 54 low noise
application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ME covers the energy range of
5-30 keV and has a total detection area of 952 cm2. The typical energy
resolution of ME at the beginning of the mission is 3 keV at 17.8 keV (Full
Width at Half Maximum, FWHM) and the time resolution is 255 us. In this study,
we present the in-orbit performance of ME in its first 5 years of operation.
Methods: The performance of ME was monitored using onboard radioactive sources
and astronomical X-ray objects. ME carries six 241Am radioactive sources for
onboard calibration, which can continuously illuminate the calibration pixels.
The long-term performance evolution of ME can be quantified using the
properties of the accumulated spectra of the calibration pixels. In addition,
observations of the Crab Nebula and the pulsar were used to check the long-term
evolution of the detection efficiency as a function of energy. Conclusion:
After 5 years of operation, 742 cm2 of the Si-PIN pixels were still working
normally. The peak positions of 241Am emission lines gradually shifted to the
high energy region, implying a slow increase in ME gain of 1.43%. A comparison
of the ME spectra of the Crab Nebula and the pulsar shows that the E-C
relations and the redistribution matrix file are still acceptable for most data
analysis works, and there is no detectable variation in the detection
efficiency.

Existing works have been investigating empirically improving the robustness of

large-amplitude perturbation on small scales in the early universe. Such an
enhanced spectrum can be realized by introducing a flat region in the potential
of single-field inflation, which makes the inflaton go into a temporary
ultraslow-roll (USR) period. In this paper, we calculate the bispectrum of
curvature perturbation in such a scenario. We explicitly confirm that
bispectrum satisfies Maldacena's theorem. At the end of the USR period, the
bispectrum is generated by bulk interaction and field redefinition. At the end
of inflation, bispectrum is generated only by bulk interaction. We also
calculate the one-loop correction to the power spectrum from the bispectrum,
called the source method. We find it consistent with the calculation of
one-loop correction from the second-order expansion of in-in perturbation
theory. In the last section of this paper, we write our response to criticism

scenario, the inflationary dynamics is driven by the $U(1)_{B-L}$ Higgs field
that is nonminimally coupled to gravity and breaks the $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry
spontaneously as it acquires a vacuum expectation value through the
Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. It is found that the reheating process proceeds
stepwise, and as the decay channels of the $U(1)_{B-L}$ Higgs field are known,
the reheating temperature is evaluated. The relation between the e-folding
number of inflation and the reheating temperature provides a strong consistency
condition on the model parameters, and we find that the recent cosmological
data gives an upper bound on the $U(1)_{B-L}$ breaking scale $v_{BL}\lesssim
10^{12}$ GeV. The lower bound is $v_{BL}\gtrsim 10^6$ GeV, obtained as the
condition for successful reheating in this model. The prediction for the cosmic

today's cosmological data. The model can be tested and is falsifiable by near

Therefore, it is unacceptable to process large-scale data in a single SMPC

  In this work, we propose a novel theory called SMPC Task Decomposition
(SMPCTD), which can securely decompose a single SMPC task into multiple SMPC
sub-tasks and multiple local tasks without leaking the original data. After
decomposition, the computing time, memory and communication consumption drop
sharply. We then decompose three machine learning (ML) SMPC tasks using our

Furthermore, we use incremental computation technique to expand the amount of

after decomposing these three SMPC tasks, the time, memory and communication

the piezoelectric properties of cement composites doped with reduced graphene
oxide (rGO) and evaluates their potential as self-powered strain sensors. To do
so, a comprehensive methodology involving voltammetry measurements, open
circuit potential determination, and uniaxial compression testing is developed
to determine the piezoelectric coefficients of charge $d_{33}$ and voltage
$g_{33}$. Furthermore, a novel circuital model for signal processing of the
electromechanical response is developed and experimentally validated in terms
of time series of output voltage, resistance, and the generated electric power.
The developed methodology is applied to laboratory samples manufactured
following two different filler dispersion methods. The presented results
evidence that samples prepared by ultrasonic cleaner dispersion achieve optimal
properties, with a piezoelectric charge coefficient of
1122.28$\mathrm{\pm}$246.67 pC/N, about 47 times greater than previously

zero-shot IR methods to deal with any size while maintaining the excellent
characteristics of zero-shot. A simple way to solve arbitrary size is to divide
it into fixed-size patches and solve each patch independently. But this may
yield significant artifacts since it neither considers the global semantics of
all patches nor the local information of adjacent patches. Inspired by the
Range-Null space Decomposition, we propose the Mask-Shift Restoration to
address local incoherence and propose the Hierarchical Restoration to alleviate
out-of-domain issues. Our simple, parameter-free approaches can be used not
only for image restoration but also for image generation of unlimited sizes,
with the potential to be a general tool for diffusion models. Code:

which poses significant challenges for the RS image change captioning (RSICC)
task to identify visual changes of interest in complex scenes and describe them
via language. However, current methods still have some weaknesses in
sufficiently extracting and utilizing multi-scale information. In this paper,
we propose a progressive scale-aware network (PSNet) to address the problem.
PSNet is a pure Transformer-based model. To sufficiently extract multi-scale
visual features, multiple progressive difference perception (PDP) layers are
stacked to progressively exploit the differencing features of bitemporal
features. To sufficiently utilize the extracted multi-scale features for
captioning, we propose a scale-aware reinforcement (SR) module and combine it
with the Transformer decoding layer to progressively utilize the features from
different PDP layers. Experiments show that the PDP layer and SR module are
effective and our PSNet outperforms previous methods.

We analyze a large corpus of more than 130,000 discussions on German Twitter

necessarily supported by facts but also without insults, relates to the least

Sarcasm also helps in achieving those outcomes, in particular in the presence
of organized extreme groups. More constructive comments such as providing facts
or exposing contradictions can backfire and attract more extremity. Mentioning
either outgroups or ingroups is typically related to a deterioration of
discourse in the long run. A pronounced emotional tone, either negative such as
anger or fear, or positive such as enthusiasm and pride, also leads to worse
outcomes. Going beyond one-shot analyses on smaller samples of discourse, our
findings have implications for the successful management of online commons

simulating and optimizing a radiation therapy treatment before administering it
to the patient. It ensures that the tumor is well covered and the dose to the
healthy tissues is minimized. However, the TPS provided by commercial companies
often come with a large panel of tools, each implemented in the form of a
black-box making it difficult for researchers to use them for implementing and
testing new ideas. To address this issue, we have developed an open-source TPS.
Approach. We have developed an open-source software platform, OpenTPS
(opentps.org), to generate treatment plans for external beam radiation therapy,
and in particular for proton therapy. It is designed to be a flexible and
user-friendly platform (coded with the freely usable Python language) that can
be used by medical physicists, radiation oncologists, and other members of the
radiation therapy community to create customized treatment plans for
educational and research purposes. Result. OpenTPS includes a range of tools
and features that can be used to analyze patient anatomy, simulate the delivery
of the radiation beam, and optimize the treatment plan to achieve the desired
dose distribution. It can be used to create treatment plans for a variety of
cancer types and was designed to be extended to other treatment modalities.
Significance. A new open-source treatment planning system has been built for
research in proton therapy. Its flexibility allows an easy integration of new
techniques and customization of treatment plans. It is freely available for use
and is regularly updated and supported by a community of users and developers
who contribute to the ongoing development and improvement of the software.

distributions. One of its major challenges is that images acquired from
different imaging machines have different imaging distributions, making it
difficult to focus only on the spatial aspect of the images and ignore
differences in distributions. In this study, we developed a self-supervised
approach, Indescribable Multi-model Spatial Evaluator (IMSE), to address
multi-modal image registration. IMSE creates an accurate multi-modal spatial
evaluator to measure spatial differences between two images, and then optimizes
registration by minimizing the error predicted of the evaluator. To optimize
IMSE performance, we also proposed a new style enhancement method called
Shuffle Remap which randomizes the image distribution into multiple segments,
and then randomly disorders and remaps these segments, so that the distribution
of the original image is changed. Shuffle Remap can help IMSE to predict the
difference in spatial location from unseen target distributions. Our results
show that IMSE outperformed the existing methods for registration using T1-T2
and CT-MRI datasets. IMSE also can be easily integrated into the traditional
registration process, and can provide a convenient way to evaluate and
visualize registration results. IMSE also has the potential to be used as a new

useful data sets and to train, validate and test these models. We find an

discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods (DGSEM). The use of
Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto (LGL) quadrature endows collocated DGSEM space
discretizations of nonlinear hyperbolic problems with properties that greatly
simplify the design of invariant domain preserving high-resolution schemes.
Compared to many other continuous and discontinuous Galerkin method variants, a
particular advantage of the LGL spectral operator is the availability of a
natural decomposition into a compatible subcell flux discretization.
Representing a high-order spatial semi-discretization in terms of intermediate
states, we perform flux limiting in a manner that keeps these states and the
results of Runge-Kutta stages in convex invariant domains. Additionally, local
bounds may be imposed on scalar quantities of interest. In contrast to limiting
approaches based on predictor-corrector algorithms, our MCL procedure for
LGL-DGSEM yields nonlinear flux approximations that are independent of the
time-step size and can be further modified to enforce entropy stability. To
demonstrate the robustness of MCL/DGSEM schemes for the compressible Euler

which spontaneously break a continuous $U(1)$ symmetry in the thermodynamic
limit are of central importance for a wide variety of physical systems, from
condensed matter to quantum simulation. Such systems are characterized by a
Goldstone excitation branch, terminating in a zero mode whose theoretical
treatment within a linearized approach leads to divergencies on finite-size
systems, revealing that the assumption of symmetry breaking is ill-defined away
from the thermodynamic limit. In this work we show that, once all its
non-linearities are taken into account, the zero mode corresponds exactly to a
U(1) quantum rotor, related to the Anderson tower of states expected in systems
showing symmetry breaking in the thermodynamic limit. The finite-momentum
modes, when weakly populated, can be instead safely linearized (namely treated
within spin-wave theory) and effectively decoupled from the zero mode. This
picture leads to an approximate separation of variables between rotor and
spin-wave ones, which allows for a correct description of the ground-state and
low-energy physics. Most importantly, it offers a quantitative treatment of the
finite-size non-equilibrium dynamics -- following a quantum quench -- dominated
by the zero mode, for which a linearized approach fails. Focusing on the 2$d$
XX model with power-law decaying interactions, we compare our equilibrium
predictions with unbiased quantum Monte Carlo results and exact
diagonalization; and our non-equilibrium results with time-dependent
variational Monte Carlo. The agreement is remarkable for all interaction
ranges, and it improves the longer the range. Our rotor/spin-wave theory

we can obtain distinct first return maps for each ordinal sequence. We define
entropy-based measures to guide our selection of the ordinal sequence for a

proactive cyber defense approaches, contrasting with the static nature of the
traditional reactive cyber defense. The key insight behind these approaches is
to impose an asymmetric disadvantage for the attacker by using deception and
randomization techniques to create a dynamic attack surface. Moving Target
Defense typically relies on system randomization and diversification, while
Cyber Deception is based on decoy nodes and fake systems to deceive attackers.
However, current Moving Target Defense techniques are complex to manage and can
introduce high overheads, while Cyber Deception nodes are easily recognized and
avoided by adversaries.
  This paper presents DOLOS, a novel architecture that unifies Cyber Deception
and Moving Target Defense approaches. DOLOS is motivated by the insight that
deceptive techniques are much more powerful when integrated into production
systems rather than deployed alongside them. DOLOS combines typical Moving
Target Defense techniques, such as randomization, diversity, and redundancy,
with cyber deception and seamlessly integrates them into production systems
through multiple layers of isolation. We extensively evaluate DOLOS against a
wide range of attackers, ranging from automated malware to professional
penetration testers, and show that DOLOS is highly effective in slowing down
attacks and protecting the integrity of production systems. We also provide
valuable insights and considerations for the future development of MTD

and infectious periods were more frequently assumed, limiting the insights
brought by mechanistic models on these. Concerning control strategies, many
models evaluated culling (n = 15), while vaccination received less attention (n
= 7). According to the reviewed articles, optimal control strategies varied
between virus subtypes and local conditions, and also depended on the
objective. For instance, vaccination was optimal when the objective was to
limit the overall number of culled flocks, while pre-emptive culling was
preferred for reducing the epidemic size and duration. Earlier implementation
of interventions consistently improved the efficacy of control strategies,
highlighting the need for effective surveillance and epidemic preparedness.
Potential improvements of mechanistic models include explicitly accounting for
various transmission routes, and distinguishing poultry populations according
to species and farm type. To provide insights to policy makers in a timely
manner, aspects about the evaluation of control strategies that could deserve
further attention include: economic evaluation, combination of strategies
including vaccination, the use of optimization algorithm instead of comparing a
limited set of scenarios, and real-time evaluation.

stability analysis. For that purpose, we develop a two-dimensional complex
eigenvalue solver relying on a Chebyshev-Fourier collocation method in physical

Hagen-Poiseuille flow known to be linearly stable for all Reynolds numbers, the
MHD pipe flow with transverse magnetic field is unstable to three-dimensional
disturbances at sufficiently high values of the Hartmann number and wall
conductance ratio. The instability observed in this regime is attributed to the
presence of velocity overspeeds in the so-called Roberts layers and the
corresponding inflection points in the mean velocity profile. The nature and
characteristics of the most unstable modes are investigated, and we show that
they vary significantly depending on the wall conductance ratio. A major result
of this paper is that the global critical Reynolds number for the MHD pipe flow

  Proxies Learning","Accepted by AAAI 2023",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For deep ordinal classification, learning a well-structured feature space
specific to ordinal classification is helpful to properly capture the ordinal
nature among classes. Intuitively, when Euclidean distance metric is used, an
ideal ordinal layout in feature space would be that the sample clusters are
arranged in class order along a straight line in space. However, enforcing
samples to conform to a specific layout in the feature space is a challenging
problem. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Constrained
Proxies Learning (CPL) method, which can learn a proxy for each ordinal class
and then adjusts the global layout of classes by constraining these proxies.
Specifically, we propose two kinds of strategies: hard layout constraint and
soft layout constraint. The hard layout constraint is realized by directly
controlling the generation of proxies to force them to be placed in a strict
linear layout or semicircular layout (i.e., two instantiations of strict
ordinal layout). The soft layout constraint is realized by constraining that
the proxy layout should always produce unimodal proxy-to-proxies similarity
distribution for each proxy (i.e., to be a relaxed ordinal layout). Experiments
show that the proposed CPL method outperforms previous deep ordinal
classification methods under the same setting of feature extractor.

tidal torque from the planets and their host stars. Alongside the planet-star
tidal and magnetic interaction, this effect leads to planets' orbital
evolution. In multiple super-Earth systems, especially in those which are
closely spaced and/or contain planets locked in mean motion resonances (MMRs),
modest mass-loss can lead to dynamical instabilities. In order to place some
constraints on the extent of planets' mass-loss, we study the evolution of a
series of idealized systems of multiple planets with equal masses and a general
scaled separation. We consider mass-loss from one or more planets either in the
conservative limit or with angular momentum loss from the system. We show that
the stable preservation of idealized multiple planetary systems requires either
a wide initial separation or a modest upper limit in the amount of mass-loss.
This constraint is stringent for the multiple planetary systems in compact and
resonant chains. Perturbation due to either impulsive giant impacts between
super-Earths or greater than a few percent mass-loss can lead to dynamical
instabilities.

the invariance of the energy functional under complex phase shifts. Our error

make coordination increasingly difficult to achieve and the consequences of
imperfect coordination can be severe. To improve teamwork in these and other
domains, we present TIC: an automated intervention approach for improving
coordination between team members. Using BTIL, a multi-agent imitation learning
algorithm, our approach first learns a generative model of team behavior from
past task execution data. Next, it utilizes the learned generative model and
team's task objective (shared reward) to algorithmically generate
execution-time interventions. We evaluate our approach in synthetic multi-agent
teaming scenarios, where team members make decentralized decisions without full
observability of the environment. The experiments demonstrate that the
automated interventions can successfully improve team performance and shed
light on the design of autonomous agents for improving teamwork.

the implementation of a simplified Lorentz collision operator in TRIMEG. Since
the code uses an unstructured mesh, a procedure for calculating the flux
surface averages of particle and energy fluxes and the bootstrap current is
derived without relying on the poloidal coordinate, which is useful also for
other simulations in unstructured meshes. With the newly implemented collision
operator, we study electron transport and bootstrap current generation for
various simplified and realistic geometries. In comparison to neoclassical
theory, good agreement is obtained for the large aspect ratio case regarding
the particle and energy fluxes as well as the bootstrap current. However, some
discrepancies are observed at moderate aspect ratio and for a case with the
realistic geometry of the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak. These deviations can be
explained by different treatments and approximations in theory and simulation.
In this paper, we demonstrate the capability to calculate the electron

a significant challenge. The fluorescence brightness is the key parameter that
generally defines the temporal resolution for these techniques. Conventional
microscopes and standard fluorescent emitters fall short in achieving the high
brightness required for sub-millisecond monitoring. Plasmonic nanoantennas have
been proposed as a solution, but despite huge fluorescence enhancement have
been obtained with these structures, the brightness generally remains below 1
million photons/s/molecule. Therefore, the improvement of temporal resolution
has been overlooked. In this article, we present a method for achieving high
temporal resolution in single-molecule fluorescence techniques using plasmonic
nanoantennas, specifically optical horn antennas. We demonstrate about 90%
collection efficiency of the total emitted light, reaching a high fluorescence
brightness of 2 million photons/s/molecule in the saturation regime. This
enables observations of single molecules with microsecond binning time and fast
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements. This work expands the
applications of plasmonic antennas and zero-mode waveguides in the fluorescence

masses of vector-like leptons which generate small mass differences among them,
and enhance their CP-violating decays via the resonant effect. Such
CP-violation and lepton number violation turns out to be a sufficient amount of
the observed baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis. The Majorana masses from
the $U(1)_X$ breaking also induce radiative generation of masses for active

choosing appropriate approximations and ensuring the approximate solution's

by truncating high-frequency noise.
  In the present work, we prove that a regularization in form of a formal

density fluctuations in systems of weakly interacting diffusing particles: We
show that in suitable weak metrics, the law of fluctuations as predicted by the

introduces OliVaR, a novel approach to olive varietal identification. OliVaR
uses a teacher-student deep learning architecture to learn the defining
characteristics of the endocarp of each specific olive variety and perform
classification. We construct what is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest

embedded in a sheet plane, with a void on the top and bottom, similar to the
local environment of MW. More interestingly, we found that the major subset (11

layer rupture time and rupture radius increases with increase in substrate
temperature. We characterize the air layer profile as a 2D Knudsen field and
show that a unified treatment, including continuum and non-continuum mechanics,
is required to comprehend the air layer dynamics coherently. The airflow
dynamics in the central dimple region falls within the purview of continuum
stokes regime. In contrast, the peripheral air disc falls within the
non-continuum (gas kinetic effects) slip flow and transition regime
characterized by a high Knudsen number. However, the initial average air disc
expansion dynamics could be understood in terms of stokes approximation. In
non-continuum regimes of the peripheral air disc, we discover intriguing
asymmetric interface perturbations. The asymmetric wetting of the substrate
initiates at the edge of the peripheral disc region.These perturbative
structures cause asymmetric wetting/contact between the droplet and the

aperture-synthesis with six 1 meter telescopes. The observed objects are
fainter than 19 magnitude, the images have sub-milliarcsecond resolution, and
the astrometry reaches micro-arcsecond precision. We give an overview of
breakthrough results from the past 15 years in O/IR interferometry on the
Galactic Center, exo-planets and their atmospheres, active galactic nuclei,
young stellar objects, and stellar physics. Following a primer in
interferometry, we summarize the technical and conceptual advances which led to
the boosts in sensitivity, precision, and imaging of modern interferometers.
Single-mode beam combiners now combine all available telescopes of the major
interferometers for imaging, and specialized image reconstruction software
advances over earlier developments for radio interferometry. With a combination
of large telescopes, adaptive optics, fringe-tracking, and especially dual-beam
interferometry, GRAVITY has boosted the sensitivity by many orders of
magnitudes. Another order of magnitude improvement will come from upgrades with
laser guide star adaptive optics. In combination with large separation
fringe-tracking, O/IR interferometry will then provide complete sky coverage
for observations in the Galactic plane, and substantial coverage for
extragalactic targets. VLTI and CHARA will remain unique in the era of upcoming

also suitable for hybrid beamforming and frequency-selective channels. In the
proposed system, channel parameters are estimated in time-domain duplex (TDD)
uplink mode using a per-cluster approach rather than a joint approach, which
significantly reduces the complexity. Per-cluster estimation is possible thanks
to the proposed interference-aware statistical beamforming method, namely
reduced dimensional Generalized Eigenbeamformer (RD-GEB), which undertakes the
computational load of interference mitigation and enables a simpler design for
the remaining stages. In addition, the overall design is based on the
separation of channel parameters as fast-time and slow-time, leaving only the
instantaneous channel estimation and channel matched filtering as fast-time
operations, which are handled inside cluster-specific reduced dimensional
subspaces. Beam tracking and beamformer construction are held in slow-time
rarely, which reduces the time-averaged complexity. Furthermore, beam tracking
is performed by leveraging a batch of instantaneous channel estimates, which
removes the need for an additional training process. The proposed

pursue a near-field modelling and performance analysis for wireless
communications with extremely large-scale IRS (XL-IRS). By taking into account
the directional gain pattern of IRS's reflecting elements and the variations in
signal amplitude across them, we derive both the lower- and upper-bounds of the
resulting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the generic uniform planar array
(UPA)-based XL-IRS. Our results reveal that, instead of scaling quadratically
and unboundedly with the number of reflecting elements M as in the conventional
UPW-based model, the SNR under the new non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW)-based
model increases with $M$ with a diminishing return and eventually converges to
a certain limit. To gain more insights, we further study the special case of
uniform linear array (ULA)-based XL-IRS, for which a closed-form SNR expression
in terms of the IRS size and locations of the base station (BS) and the user is
derived. Our result shows that the SNR is mainly determined by the two
geometric angles formed by the BS/user locations with the IRS, as well as the
dimension of the IRS. Numerical results validate our analysis and demonstrate
the necessity of proper near-field modelling for wireless communications aided

diagrams. We also want to compare the results of a traditional cluster analysis
with those of automated methods. We selected three young open cluster
candidates from the UBC catalogue, ranging from a well-populated object with a
well-defined sequence to a poorly-populated, poorly-defined candidate. We
obtained classification spectra for the brightest stars in each. We
redetermined members based on EDR3 data and fitted isochrones to derive age,
distance and reddening. All three candidates are real clusters with age below
100 Ma. UBC103 is a moderately populous cluster, with an age around 70 Ma. At a
distance of $\sim$ 3 kpc, it forms a binary cluster with the nearby NGC6683.
UBC114 is a relatively nearby ($\sim1.5$kpc) poorly-populated cluster
containing two early-B stars. UBC587 is a dispersed, very young ($<$ 10 Ma)
cluster located at $\sim3$ kpc, behind the Cygnus~X region, and may be a
valuable tracer of the Orion arm. The OCfinder methodology for the
identification of new open clusters is extremely successful, with even poor
candidates resulting in interesting detections. The presence of an almost
vertical photometric sequence in the Gaia colour-magnitude diagram is a safe
way to identify young open clusters. Automated methods for the determination of
cluster properties give approximate solutions, but are still subject to some
difficulties. There is some evidence suggesting that artificial intelligence

side wall with a modal structure that precesses anti-cyclonically (counter to
the applied rotation) along the side wall. It is surmised that this is a robust
non-linear evolution of the wall modes observed before the onset of bulk
convection. Here, we perform direct numerical simulations of cylindrically
confined rotating convection at high rotation rates and strong turbulent
forcing. Through comparison with earlier work, we find a fit-parameter-free
relation that links the angular drift frequency of the robust wall mode
observed far into the turbulent regime with the critical wall mode frequency at
onset, firmly substantiating the connection between the observed boundary zonal
flow and the wall modes. Deviations from this relation at stronger turbulent
forcing suggest early signs of the bulk turbulence starting to hamper the
development of the wall mode. Furthermore, by studying the interactive flow
between the robust wall mode and the bulk turbulence, we identify radial jets
penetrating from the wall mode into the bulk. These jets induce a large scale
multipolar vortex structure in the bulk turbulence, dependent on the wavenumber
of the wall mode. In a narrow cylinder the entire bulk flow is dominated by a
quadrupolar vortex driven by the radial jets, while in a wider cylinder the
jets are found to have a finite penetration length and the vortices do not
cover the entire bulk. We also identify the role of Reynolds stresses in the
generation of zonal flows in the region near the sidewall.

$^{14,15}$O nuclei at the energies near the proton-emission threshold are
calculated using the Skyrme Hartree-Fock (SHF) in continuum approach. For each
excitation function, the first resonance is identified as the $s$-state
resonance of the mean-field theory. For $^{15}$O, whose ground-state spin is
nonzero, the $s$-state resonance splits into two resonances via the spin-spin
component of the optical potential. With a slight adjustment of the strength of
central potential, which is obtained from the SHF in continuum approach, the
excitation functions of proton elastic scattering for the three nuclei can be
explained with high accuracy. The proposed framework can provide a practical
method to explain nuclear scattering at the energies near the proton-emission
threshold with minimal experimental input.

of Legramanti et al. (2020), which is a spike-and-slab shrinkage prior where
the spike probability is stochastically increasing and constructed from the
stick-breaking representation of a Dirichlet process prior. As a first
contribution, this CUSP prior is extended by involving arbitrary stick-breaking
representations arising from beta distributions. As a second contribution, we
prove that exchangeable spike-and-slab priors, which are popular and widely
used in sparse Bayesian factor analysis, can be represented as a finite
generalized CUSP prior, which is easily obtained from the decreasing order
statistics of the slab probabilities. Hence, exchangeable spike-and-slab
shrinkage priors imply increasing shrinkage as the column index in the loading
matrix increases, without imposing explicit order constraints on the slab
probabilities. An application to sparse Bayesian factor analysis illustrates
the usefulness of the findings of this paper. A new exchangeable spike-and-slab

propose ORCHNet, a deep-learning-based approach that maps 3D-LiDAR scans to
global descriptors. Specifically, this work proposes a new global feature
aggregation approach, which fuses multiple aggregation methods into a robust
global descriptor. ORCHNet is evaluated on real-world data collected in
orchards, comprising data from the summer and autumn seasons. To assess the
robustness, We compare ORCHNet with state-of-the-art aggregation approaches on

evaluate the proposed approach as part of a localization framework, where
ORCHNet is used as a loop closure detector. The empirical results indicate
that, on the place recognition task, ORCHNet outperforms the remaining
approaches, and is also more robust across seasons. As for the localization,
the edge cases where the path goes through the trees are solved when
integrating ORCHNet as a loop detector, showing the potential applicability of
the proposed approach in this task. The code and dataset will be publicly

achieved in dielectric nanoparticles due to the absence of intrinsic losses, in
the case of plasmonic nanostructures this is still lacking. Here, we report an
easy-to-fabricate planar plasmonic nanostructure found via topology
optimization, which exhibits an anapole state with close-to-ideal
characteristics in the visible regime including weak absorption, high
near-field enhancment, and strong suppression of scattering. The nanonantenna
can act as an individual meta-atom because, due to low inter-coupling, it
preserves its optical response even when used in highly packed metasurfaces and
metamaterials. The low losses are due to the optimized topology which provides
concentration of the field outside the structure with minimum penetration
inside the metal. Compared to anapole states in dielectric structures, the
accessibility of the volume of enhanced field is suitable for sensing
applications. Anapole states are typically interpreted as the result of the
interference between electric and toroidal dipole moments. Here and based on a
novel approach, in the context of secondary multipole analysis, we introduce
the concept of anapole state without using the contribution of toroidal dipole
moments. The article provides new insight into anapoles in plasmonic

overcomes several challenges relating to the smoothness of Hamiltonian curves

general framework for the analysis of Markov chains on Riemannian manifolds,
derive new smoothness bounds on Hamiltonian curves, a central topic of

gives sharper bounds; these properties appear to be of independent interest.

Edge nodes often operate in highly unpredictable environments, and replicating
job execution improves the job mean execution time. However, directing more
resources to some computing jobs will block (and pass to the cloud) the
execution of others. We evaluate the system performance using two metrics: job
computing time and job blocking probability. We show that the job computing
time decreases with increasing replication factor but so does the job blocking
probability. Therefore, there is a tradeoff between job computing time and

system of Cahn-Hilliard type that constitutes an extension of the classical
Caginalp model for nonisothermal phase transitions with a conserved order

for the order parameter with the universal balance law of internal energy. In
place of the standard Fourier form, the constitutive law of the heat flux is
assumed in the form given by the theory developed by Green and Naghdi, which
accounts for a possible thermal memory of the evolution. This has the
consequence that the balance law of internal energy becomes a second-order in
time equation for the thermal displacement or freezing index, that is, a
primitive with respect to time of the temperature. Another particular feature
of our system is the presence of the source term in the equation for the order
parameter, which entails additional mathematical difficulties because the mass
conservation of the order parameter, typical of the classic Cahn-Hilliard
equation, is no longer satisfied. In this paper, we analyze the case that the
double-well potential driving the evolution of the phase transition is

the singular logarithmic case) on a finite open interval; nondifferentiable
cases like the double obstacle potential are excluded from the analysis. We
prove the Fr\'echet differentiability of the control-to-state operator between

to the scarcity of real data, we trained our algorithms using mocks that were
purpose-built to reproduce the distributions of different types of objects that

observations in terms of signal and noise. We compare the performance of the
CNNs with other well-established Machine Learning classification methods based

  arXiv:2208.03027",,,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The smooth development of large parts of mathematics hinges on the idea that
some sets are `small' or `negligible' and can therefore be ignored for a given
purpose. The perhaps most famous smallness notion, namely `measure zero',
originated with Lebesgue, while a second smallness notion, namely `meagre' or
`first category', originated with Baire around the same time. The associated
Baire category theorem is a central result governing the properties of meagre
(and related) sets, while the same holds for Tao's pigeonhole principle for
measure spaes and measure zero sets. In this paper, we study these theorems in
Kohlenbach's higher-order Reverse Mathematics, identifying a considerable
number of equivalent theorems. The latter involve most basic properties of
semi-continuous and pointwise discontinuous functions, Blumberg's theorem,
Riemann integration, and Volterra's early work circa 1881. All the
aforementioned theorems fall (far) outside of the Big Five of Reverse
Mathematics, and we investigate natural restrictions like Baire 1 and
quasi-continuity that make these theorems provable again in the Big Five (or
similar). Finally, despite the fundamental differences between measure and
category, the proofs of our equivalences turn out to be similar.

would boost the integration of graphene on consumer electronics since defects
hinder its optoelectronic properties. In this work, the influence of the
different surface terminations of c-plane sapphire substrates on the synthesis
of graphene via plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) is studied.
The different terminations of the sapphire surface are controlled by a plasma
etching process. A design of experiments (DoE) procedure was carried out to
evaluate the major effects governing the etching process of four different
parameters: i.e. discharge power, time, pressure and gas employed. In the
characterization of the substrate, two sapphire surface terminations were
identified and characterized by means of contact angle measurements, being a
hydrophilic (hydrophobic) surface the fingerprint of an Al- (OH-) terminated
surface, respectively. The defects within the synthesized graphene were
analysed by Raman spectroscopy. Notably, we found that the ID/IG ratio
decreases for graphene grown on OH-terminated surfaces. Furthermore, two
different regimes related to the nature of graphene defects were identified and
depending on the sapphire terminated surface are bound either to vacancy or
boundary like defects. Finally, studying the density of defects and the
crystallite area, as well as their relationship with the sapphire surface
termination paves the way for increasing the crystallinity of the synthesized
graphene.

transmission electron microscopy characterization, but increasingly also for
the controlled manipulation of two-dimensional materials. The displacement
cross sections of monolayer hBN are measured using aberration-corrected
scanning transmission electron microscopy in near ultra-high vacuum at primary
beam energies between 50 and 90 keV. Damage rates below 80 keV are up to three
orders of magnitude lower than previously measured at edges under poorer
residual vacuum conditions where chemical etching appears to have been
dominant. Notably, is possible to create single vacancies in hBN using electron
irradiation, with boron almost twice as likely as nitrogen to be ejected below
80 keV. Moreover, any damage at such low energies cannot be explained by
elastic knock-on, even when accounting for vibrations of the atoms. A
theoretical description is developed to account for lowering of the
displacement threshold due to valence ionization resulting from inelastic
scattering of probe electrons, modelled using charge-constrained density
functional theory molecular dynamics. Although significant reductions are found
depending on the constrained charge, quantitative predictions for realistic
ionization states are currently not possible. Nonetheless, there is potential
for defect-engineering of hBN at the level of single vacancies using electron
irradiation.

class-specific attribution maps based on counterfactuals to identify which

Human-computer interaction is a practical and feasible way to tackle the

scattering angle are investigated. It is found that the scattering angular
distribution strongly depends on the isospin and the impact parameter of the
collision system. The optimal angle ranges for detecting $N=126$ neutron-rich
nuclides $^{204}$Pt, $^{203}$Ir, $^{202}$Os, and $^{201}$Re in the $^{136}$Xe +
$^{208}$Pb reaction at the incident energy $E_{c.m.} = 526MeV$ are predicted.
Our results suggest that the angle range $45^{\circ} \leqslant
\theta_{\mathrm{lab}} \leqslant 50^{\circ}$ is most favorable for detecting
unknown N=126 isotones. Given the current difficulties in separating and
identifying experimental MNT fragments, the results of this work could provide
significant contributions to future experiments.

perceived quality of a single image, whose performance has been improved by
deep learning-based methods in recent years. However, the paucity of labeled
data somewhat restrains deep learning-based BIQA methods from unleashing their
full potential. In this paper, we propose to solve the problem by a pretext
task customized for BIQA in a self-supervised learning manner, which enables
learning representations from orders of magnitude more data. To constrain the
learning process, we propose a quality-aware contrastive loss based on a simple
assumption: the quality of patches from a distorted image should be similar,
but vary from patches from the same image with different degradations and
patches from different images. Further, we improve the existing degradation
process and form a degradation space with the size of roughly $2\times10^7$.
After pre-trained on ImageNet using our method, models are more sensitive to
image quality and perform significantly better on downstream BIQA tasks.
Experimental results show that our method obtains remarkable improvements on
popular BIQA datasets.

Constrained clustering is a semi-supervised extension to this process that can

exploited. Well-known examples of such constraints are must-link (indicating
that two instances belong to the same group) and cannot-link (two instances
definitely do not belong together). The research area of constrained clustering
has grown significantly over the years with a large variety of new algorithms
and more advanced types of constraints being proposed. However, no unifying
overview is available to easily understand the wide variety of available
methods, constraints and benchmarks. To remedy this, this study presents
in-detail the background of constrained clustering and provides a novel ranked
taxonomy of the types of constraints that can be used in constrained
clustering. In addition, it focuses on the instance-level pairwise constraints,
and gives an overview of its applications and its historical context. Finally,
it presents a statistical analysis covering 307 constrained clustering methods,
categorizes them according to their features, and provides a ranking score
indicating which methods have the most potential based on their popularity and

positioned with about 0.25lambda of the lower band (2.5 GHz). The proposed MIMO
antenna is incorporated with the EBG structure to enhance the radiation
characteristic and isolation between two radiating components. The return loss

smoothly to zero size at a finite value of the holographic direction, hence
introducing a physical scale in a way that mimics the effect of confinement in
the dual four-dimensional field theory. We study the spectrum of small
fluctuations of the bulk fields carrying SO(5) quantum numbers, which can be
interpreted as spin-0 and spin-1 bound states in the dual field theory. This
work supplements an earlier publication, focused only on the SO(5) singlet

attention to composite states that have the right quantum numbers to be

  We find that in this model the PNGBs are generally heavy, with masses of the

qualitatively new, unexpected result. When the dimension of the field-theory

dimensionality, there exists a region of parameter space in which the PNGBs and
the lightest scalar are both parametrically light in comparison to all other

metastable classical backgrounds, this finding might be relevant to model

ferromagnetic skyrmions being continuously compressed against a rigid wall
under dc and ac drives. The compressed skyrmions can be annihilated close to
the wall and form a conformal crystal with both a size and a density gradient,
making it distinct from conformal crystals observed previously for
superconducting vortices and colloidal particles. For both dc and ac driving,
the skyrmions can move transverse to the compression direction due to a
combination of density and size gradients. Forces in the compression direction
are converted by the Magnus force into transverse motion. Under ac driving, the
amount of skyrmion annihilation is reduced and we find a skyrmion Magnus
ratchet pump. We also observe shear banding in which skyrmions near the wall
move up to twice as fast as skyrmions further from the wall. When we vary the
magnitude of the applied drive, we find a critical current above which the
skyrmions are completely annihilated during a time scale that depends on the
magnitude of the drive. By varying the magnetic parameters, we find that the
transverse motion is strongly dependent on the skyrmion size. Smaller skyrmions
are more rigid, which interferes with the size gradient and destroys the
transverse motion. We also confirm the role of the size gradient by comparing
our atomistic simulations with a particle-based model, where we find that the
transverse motion is only transient. Our results are relevant for applications
where skyrmions encounter repulsive magnetic walls, domain walls, or
interfaces.

relationships among service components and build a causal graph. Availability
of domain information makes cloud systems even better suited for such causal
detection approaches. In modern cloud systems, however, auto-scalers
dynamically change the number of microservice instances, and a load-balancer
manages the load on each instance. This poses a challenge for off-the-shelf
causal structure detection techniques as they neither incorporate the system
architectural domain information nor provide a way to model distributed compute
across varying numbers of service instances. To address this, we develop
CausIL, which detects a causal structure among service metrics by considering
compute distributed across dynamic instances and incorporating domain knowledge
derived from system architecture. Towards the application in cloud systems,
CausIL estimates a causal graph using instance-specific variations in
performance metrics, modeling multiple instances of a service as independent,
conditional on system assumptions. Simulation study shows the efficacy of
CausIL over baselines by improving graph estimation accuracy by ~25% as
measured by Structural Hamming Distance whereas the real-world dataset
demonstrates CausIL's applicability in deployment settings.

we bound them by showing the adaptive learning rate has a limited range, which

pulses brings an opportunity to reach high values of the dimensionless
rest-frame acceleration $\chi$ and thereby invoke processes described by
strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SFQED). Measuring deviations from the
results of perturbative SFQED at high $\chi$ can be valuable for testing the
existing predictions, as well as for guiding further theoretical developments.
Nevertheless such experimental measurements are challenging due to the
probabilistic nature of the interaction processes, a strong background produced
by low-$\chi$ interactions and limited capabilities to control and measure the
alignment and synchronization in such collision experiments. Here we elaborate
a methodology of using approximate Bayesian computations (ABC) for retrieving
statistically justified inferences based on the results of many repeated
experiments even in case of partially unknown collision parameters that vary
from experiment to experiment. As a proof of principles, we consider the
problem of inferring the effective mass change due to coupling with
strong-field environment.

developed, we can evaluate the model on a large dataset of 7500 scenarios in
various ambient conditions to estimate the year-round performance of the system

on positive temperature coefficient (PTC) elements, we can thus show that a
heat pump (HP) can reduce the annual mean power consumption by up to 60%.
Ceiling-mounted radiant heating elements complementing a PTC heating system can
reduce the annual mean power consumption by up to 10%, while they cannot
improve the energy efficiency when used in conjunction with a HP. Finally, a
broad sensitivity study reveals the fact that improving the HP's heating-mode

mean annual power consumption. Moreover, the annual energy expenditure for
cooling are around eight times smaller than those for heating. The case study
considered thus reveals that the advantages of improving the COP of the cooling

data-driven VAE prior and density approximation of the posterior of the latent

devices transmit values by analog amplitude modulation so that a function of
these values is computed over the communication channel at a common receiver.
The physical reason is the superposition properties of the electromagnetic
waves, which naturally return sums of analog values. Consequently, the
applications of AirComp are almost entirely restricted to analog communication
systems. However, the use of digital communications for over-the-air
computations would have several benefits, such as error correction,
synchronization, acquisition of channel state information, and easier adoption
by current digital communication systems. Nevertheless, a common belief is that
digital modulations are generally unfeasible for computation tasks because the
overlapping of digitally modulated signals returns signals that seem to be
meaningless for these tasks. This paper breaks through such a belief and
proposes a fundamentally new computing method, named ChannelComp, for
performing over-the-air computations by any digital modulation. In particular,
we propose digital modulation formats that allow us to compute a wider class of
functions than AirComp can compute, and we propose a feasibility optimization
problem that ascertains the optimal digital modulation for computing functions
over-the-air. The simulation results verify the superior performance of
ChannelComp in comparison to AirComp, particularly for the product functions,
with around 10 dB improvement of the computation error.

the global attention to focus on substructures and promotes the expressiveness
of the representations, addressing the limitation of self-attention as the

from a common feature, which is the strong valley symmetry breaking
characteristic of these moir\'e systems at the magic angle. This leads to a
breakdown of the rotational symmetry of the flat moir\'e bands down to $C_3$,
and to ground states in which the time-reversal symmetry is broken for a given
spin projection. However, this symmetry can be recovered upon exchange of
spin-up and spin-down electrons, as we illustrate by means of a self-consistent
microscopic Hartree-Fock resolution where the states for the two spin
projections acquire opposite sign of the valley polarization. There is then a
spin-valley locking by which the Fermi lines for the two spin projections are
different and related by inversion symmetry. This effect represents a large
renormalization of the bare spin-orbit coupling of the graphene multilayers,
lending protection to the superconductivity against in-plane magnetic fields.
In the twisted bilayer as well as in trilayer and quadrilayer graphene, the
pairing glue is shown to be given by the nesting between parallel segments of
the Fermi lines which arise from the breakdown of symmetry down to $C_3$. This
leads to a strong Kohn-Luttinger pairing instability, which is relevant until
the Fermi line recovers gradually a more isotropic shape towards the bottom of
the second valence band, explaining why the superconductivity fades away beyond
three-hole doping of the moir\'e unit cell.

machine learning to mitigate the influence of jet background in central
heavy-ion collisions, which enables measurements of inclusive jet suppression
for jet $p_{\rm T} \geq 40$ GeV/$c$ in central collisions at a resolution

Path Finding (MAPF) community has recently started to embrace Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where agents learn to collaboratively generate
individual, collision-free (but often suboptimal) paths. Scalability is usually
achieved by assuming a local field of view (FOV) around the agents, helping
scale to arbitrary world sizes. However, this assumption significantly limits
the amount of information available to the agents, making it difficult for them
to enact the type of joint maneuvers needed in denser MAPF tasks. In this
paper, we propose SCRIMP, where agents learn individual policies from even very
small (down to 3x3) FOVs, by relying on a highly-scalable global/local
communication mechanism based on a modified transformer. We further equip
agents with a state-value-based tie-breaking strategy to further improve
performance in symmetric situations, and introduce intrinsic rewards to
encourage exploration while mitigating the long-term credit assignment problem.
Empirical evaluations on a set of experiments indicate that SCRIMP can achieve
higher performance with improved scalability compared to other state-of-the-art
learning-based MAPF planners with larger FOVs, and even yields similar
performance as a classical centralized planner in many cases. Ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques. Finally, we show
that our trained model can be directly implemented on real robots for online

advances of deep learning, there are still several factors negatively affecting
the performance of deep learning models. Domain shift is one of these factors
and is caused by discrepancies in the distributions of the testing and training
data. In this paper, we focus on the problem of compact feature clustering in
domain generalization to help optimize the embedding space from multi-domain
data. We design a domainaware triplet loss for domain generalization to help
the model to not only cluster similar semantic features, but also to disperse
features arising from the domain. Unlike previous methods focusing on
distribution alignment, our algorithm is designed to disperse domain
information in the embedding space. The basic idea is motivated based on the
assumption that embedding features can be clustered based on domain
information, which is mathematically and empirically supported in this paper.
In addition, during our exploration of feature clustering in domain
generalization, we note that factors affecting the convergence of metric
learning loss in domain generalization are more important than the pre-defined
domains. To solve this issue, we utilize two methods to normalize the embedding
space, reducing the internal covariate shift of the embedding features. The
ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithm. Moreover, the
experiments on the benchmark datasets, including PACS, VLCS and Office-Home,
show that our method outperforms related methods focusing on domain
discrepancy. In particular, our results on RegnetY-16 are significantly better

training. Considering the strong adjustability of backdoor triggers, we are
motivated to mitigate the model bias by carefully designing reverse artificial
bias created from backdoor attack. Based on this, we propose a backdoor
debiasing framework based on knowledge distillation, which effectively reduces
the model bias from original data and minimizes security risks from the
backdoor attack. The proposed solution is validated on both image and
structured datasets, showing promising results. This work advances the
understanding of backdoor attacks and highlights its potential for beneficial
applications. The code for the study can be found at

processes in which the reorganization of individual constituents at the
nanoscale drives group-level movements and shape changes at the macroscale over
time. However, light-induced degradation of fluorophores, photobleaching, is a
significant problem in extended live cell imaging in life science, and
excellent prior arts of STED, MINSTED, or MINFLUX intentionally apply
photobleaching optics for super-resolution, yet lack extended live-cell imaging
capability as fluorophores reach an irreversible photobleaching limit. Here, we
report an innovative way of opening a long-time investigation window of living
matter by a nonbleaching phase intensity nanoscope: PINE. We accomplish
phase-intensity separation to obtain phase differences between electric field
components, such that nanoprobes within a diffraction limited region are
distinguished from one another by an integrated phase-intensity multilayer thin
film (polyvinyl alcohol/liquid crystal). We obtain distributional patterns of
precisely localized nanoprobes to overcome a physical limit to resolve sub-10
nm cellular architectures, and achieve the first dynamic imaging of nanoscopic
reorganization over 250 hours using nonbleaching PINE. Since PINE allows a
long-time investigation window, we discover nanoscopic rearrangements
synchronized with the emergence of group-level movements and shape changes at
the macroscale according to a set of interaction rules. We believe that PINE
and its application presented here provide a mechanistic understanding of
emergent dynamics important in cellular and soft matter reorganization,
self-organization, and pattern formation.

carrying out a critical analysis of the linguistic abilities of the most recent
NLU systems. I contend that they incorporate important aspects of the way
language is learnt and processed by humans, but at the same time they lack key
interpretive and inferential skills that it is unlikely they can attain unless
they are integrated with structured knowledge and the ability to exploit it for

signals can diagnose levels of hypovolemia remains insufficiently explored. The
present study explores the discriminative ability of a deep learning (DL)
framework to classify levels of ongoing hypovolemia, simulated via novel
dynamic lower body negative pressure (LBNP) model among healthy volunteers. We
used a dynamic LBNP protocol as opposed to the traditional model, where LBNP is
applied in a predictable step-wise, progressively descending manner. This
dynamic LBNP version assists in circumventing the problem posed in terms of
time dependency, as in real-life pre-hospital settings, intravascular blood
volume may fluctuate due to volume resuscitation. A supervised DL-based
framework for ternary classification was realized by segmenting the underlying
noninvasive signal and labeling segments with corresponding LBNP target levels.
The proposed DL model with two inputs was trained with respective
time-frequency representations extracted on waveform segments to classify each
of them into blood volume loss: Class 1 (mild); Class 2 (moderate); or Class 3
(severe). At the outset, the latent space derived at the end of the DL model
via late fusion among both inputs assists in enhanced classification
performance. When evaluated in a 3-fold cross-validation setup with stratified
subjects, the experimental findings demonstrated PPG to be a potential
surrogate for variations in blood volume with average classification
performance, AUROC: 0.8861, AUPRC: 0.8141, $F1$-score:72.16%, Sensitivity:79.06
%, and Specificity:89.21 %. Our proposed DL algorithm on PPG signal
demonstrates the possibility of capturing the complex interplay in
physiological responses related to both bleeding and fluid resuscitation using
this challenging LBNP setup.

  Ontologies","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2008.05297",,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  OWL ontologies are a quite popular way to describe structured knowledge in
terms of classes, relations among classes and class instances. In this paper,
given a target class T of an OWL ontology, with a focus on ontologies with
real- and boolean-valued data properties, we address the problem of learning
graded fuzzy concept inclusion axioms with the aim of describing enough
conditions for being an individual classified as instance of the class T. To do
so, we present PN-OWL that is a two-stage learning algorithm made of a P-stage
and an N-stage. Roughly, in the P-stage the algorithm tries to cover as many
positive examples as possible (increase recall), without compromising too much
precision, while in the N-stage, the algorithm tries to rule out as many false
positives, covered by the P-stage, as possible. PN-OWL then aggregates the
fuzzy inclusion axioms learnt at the P-stage and the N-stage by combining them
via aggregation functions to allow for a final decision whether an individual
is instance of T or not. We also illustrate its effectiveness by means of an
experimentation. An interesting feature is that fuzzy datatypes are built
automatically, the learnt fuzzy concept inclusions can be represented directly
into Fuzzy OWL 2 and, thus, any Fuzzy OWL 2 reasoner can then be used to
automatically determine/classify (and to which degree) whether an individual
belongs to the target class T or not.

for bosons (spin $0$ and spin $1$) we obtain a quadratic form of GUP, while for

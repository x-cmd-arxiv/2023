overcome the computational challenges of fully quantum approaches. However,
current models typically suffer from long-standing consistency issues, and, in
some cases, invalidate Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Here, we present a
fully Hamiltonian theory of quantum-classical dynamics that appears to be the
first to ensure a series of consistency properties, beyond positivity of
quantum and classical densities. Based on Lagrangian phase-space paths, the
model possesses a quantum-classical Poincar\'e integral invariant as well as
infinite classes of Casimir functionals. We also exploit Lagrangian
trajectories to formulate a finite-dimensional closure scheme for numerical
implementations.

algebraic numbers. In this expository work, we provide an introduction to the
study of ranks of matrices with coefficients in $\mathscr{L}$. We begin by
considering a slightly different question, namely we present a proof of a weak
form of Baker's Theorem. This states that a collection of elements of
$\mathscr{L}$ that is linearly independent over $\mathbf{Q}$ is in fact linear
independent over $\overline{\mathbf{Q}}$. Next we recall Schanuel's Conjecture
and prove Ax's analogue of it over $\mathbf{C}((t))$.
  We then consider arbitrary matrices with coefficients in $\mathscr{L}$ and
state the Structural Rank Conjecture, which gives a conjecture for the rank of
a general matrix with coefficients in $\mathscr{L}$. We prove the theorem of
Waldschmidt and Masser, which provides a lower bound giving a partial result
toward the Structural Rank Conjecture. We conclude by stating a new conjecture
that we call the Matrix Coefficient Conjecture, which gives a necessary
condition for a square matrix with coefficients in $\mathscr{L}$ to be
singular.

initial and final positions as boundary conditions and collision avoidance as
constraints. It is transcribed into a nonlinear programming problem using
Chebyshev pseudospectral method. The state and control histories are
approximated by using Lagrange polynomials and the collocation points are used
to satisfy constraints. A novel sigmoid-type collision avoidance constraint is
proposed to overcome the drawbacks of Lagrange polynomial approximation in
pseudospectral methods that only guarantees inequality constraint satisfaction
only at nodal points. Automatic differentiation of cost function and
constraints is used to quickly determine their gradient and Jacobian,
respectively. An APF method is used to update the optimal control inputs for
guaranteeing collision avoidance. The trajectory optimization and APF method
are implemented in a closed-loop fashion continuously, but in parallel at
moderate and high frequencies, respectively. The initial guess for the

values, of the various definitions that can be established for the dose rate in
PBS proton therapy.
  Methods: In an in silico study, five definitions of the dose rate, namely the
PBS dose rate, the percentile dose rate, the maximum percentile dose rate, the
average dose rate, and the dose averaged dose rate (DADR) were analyzed first
through theoretical comparison, and then applied to a head and neck case. To
carry out this study, a treatment plan utilizing a single energy level and
requiring the use of a patient-specific range modulator was employed. The dose
rate values were compared both locally and by means of dose rate volume
histograms (DRVHs).
  Results: The PBS dose rate, the percentile dose rate, and the maximum
percentile dose are definitions that are specifically designed to take into
account the time structure of the delivery of a PBS treatment plan. Although
they may appear similar, our study shows that they can vary locally by up to
10%. On the other hand, the DADR values were approximately twice as high as
those of the PBS, percentile and maximum percentile dose rates, since the DADR
disregards the periods when a voxel does not receive any dose. Finally, the
average dose rate can be defined in various ways, as discussed in this paper.
The average dose rate is found to be lower by a factor of approximately 1/2
than the PBS, percentile and maximum percentile dose rates.
  Conclusions: We have shown that using different definitions for the dose rate
in FLASH proton therapy can lead to variations in calculated values ranging
from a few percent to a factor of two. Since the dose rate is a critical
parameter in FLASH radiation therapy, it is essential to carefully consider the
choice of definition. However, to make an informed decision, additional
biological data and models are needed.

powerful modeling framework for identifying the temporal dynamics underlying
binary time series data, which arise in a variety of contexts such as binary

traditional subspace identification methods to the Bernoulli setting via a

robust, fixed-cost estimator that avoids the hazards of local optima and the
long computation time of iterative fitting procedures like the
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In regimes where data is limited or

demonstrate that the spectral estimate provides a good initialization for
Laplace-EM fitting. Finally, we show that the estimator provides substantial

existence of diverse loss distributions is justified by the dynamic nature of

and investigated to demonstrate the effect of random fluctuations on stability
and predictability. In a stochastic context, the well-known deterministic
result that ventilation driven by the competing effects of buoyancy and wind
admits multiple steady states can be misleading, due to two distinct phenomena.
First, with unbounded fluctuations in the buoyancy exchanged with an external
environment, such systems eventually reside in the vicinity of global minima of
their potential, rather than local minima associated with meta-stable
equilibria. In the particular context of one heated space with a leeward
low-level and windward high-level opening, sustained buoyancy-driven flow
opposing the wind direction is unlikely for wind strengths that exceed a
statistically critical value, which is slightly larger than the critical value
of the wind strength at which bifurcation in the deterministic system occurs.
Second, fluctuations in the applied wind modify the topology of the system's
potential due to the nonlinear role that wind strength has in the equation for
buoyancy conservation. Sufficiently large fluctuations in the wind rule out the
possibility of ventilation opposing the wind direction at large base wind
strengths. Although the phenomena described above might be perceived as making
prediction easier, the results also highlight that certainty in the eventual
state of the system goes hand in hand with uncertainty associated with longer
transient effects. The work addresses growing interest in applying stochastic
analysis to problems relating to building ventilation and urban fluid mechanics
by describing a mathematically accessible example of the `stochasticisation' of
a canonical deterministic model, while highlighting the subtleties and
challenges of developing stochastic models for ventilation in the future.

a semi-direct product with the modular symmetry $T^\prime$. The modular
transformations of different $\Delta(27)$ multiplets are given by solving the
consistency condition. The eight nontrivial singlets of $\Delta(27)$ are
related by $T'$ modular symmetry, and they have to be present or absent
simultaneously in any $\Omega(1)$ model. The most general forms of the
superpotential and K\""ahler potential invariant under $\Omega(1)$ are
discussed, and the corresponding fermion mass matrices are presented. Based on
the eclectic flavor group $\Omega(1)$, two concrete lepton models which can
successfully describe the experimental data of lepton masses and mixing
parameters are constructed. For the two models without gCP, all six mixing
parameters vary in small regions. A nearly maximal atmospheric mixing angle
$\theta_{23}$ and Dirac CP phase $\delta_{CP}$ are obtained in the first model.
After considering the compatible gCP symmetry and the assumption of $\Re

Firstly, we develop a method for converting the plan of a building into what we

environment, we assume it has no knowledge about it, and it estimates an online
situational graph representation (S-Graph) of its surroundings. We develop a
novel graph-to-graph matching method, in order to relate the S-Graph estimated
online from the robot sensors and the A-Graph extracted from the building
plans. Note the challenge in this, as the S-Graph may show a partial view of
the full A-Graph, their nodes are heterogeneous and their reference frames are
different. After the matching, both graphs are aligned and merged, resulting in
what we denote as an informed Situational Graph (iS-Graph), with which we
achieve global robot localization and exploitation of prior knowledge from the
building plans. Our experiments show that our pipeline shows a higher
robustness and a significantly lower pose error than several LiDAR localization

the first test of a kinetic impactor for asteroid deflection by impacting
Dimorphos, the secondary of near-Earth binary asteroid (65803) Didymos, and
changing the orbital period of Dimorphos. A change in orbital period of
approximately 7 minutes was expected if the incident momentum from the DART
spacecraft was directly transferred to the asteroid target in a perfectly
inelastic collision, but studies of the probable impact conditions and asteroid
properties indicated that a considerable momentum enhancement ($\beta$) was
possible. In the years prior to impact, we used lightcurve observations to
accurately determine the pre-impact orbit parameters of Dimorphos with respect
to Didymos. Here we report the change in the orbital period of Dimorphos as a
result of the DART kinetic impact to be -33.0 +/- 1.0 (3$\sigma$) minutes.
Using new Earth-based lightcurve and radar observations, two independent
approaches determined identical values for the change in the orbital period.
This large orbit period change suggests that ejecta contributed a significant
amount of momentum to the asteroid beyond what the DART spacecraft carried.

addressed. The ""Q drops"" are very short texts, written in a way that constitute
a sort of literary genre in itself, with very peculiar features of style. These
texts might have been written by different authors, whose other writings are
often hard to find. After an online ethnology of the movement, necessary to
collect enough material written by these thirteen potential authors, we use
supervised machine learning to build stylistic profiles for each of them. We
then performed a rolling analysis on Q's writings, to see if any of those
linguistic profiles match the so-called 'QDrops' in part or entirety. We
conclude that two different individuals, Paul F. and Ron W., are the closest
match to Q's linguistic signature, and they could have successively written Q's
texts. These potential authors are not high-ranked personality from the U.S.
administration, but rather social media activists.

separable states? This is a long-standing open question in quantum information.
More concretely, assuming that two non-communicating parties interact
classically with a verifier, can the verifier distinguish the following two
cases: (i) the parties have access to an entangled state, (ii) they have access
to a separable state only (a local hidden variable model). In this work, we
define a computational version of state non-locality, and show that if every
entangled state exhibits such non-locality then $\mathtt{BQP} \neq
\mathtt{PP}$.
  Surprisingly, we demonstrate how this result implies that if a one-round
delegation of quantum computation (DQC) exists then $\mathtt{BQP} \neq
\mathtt{PP}$. This gives a necessary complexity-theoretic assumption needed for
the existence of such DQC. Our proof technique essentially builds a framework
that allows one to give stronger lower-bounds for DQC by proving upper-bounds
for the complexity of local-hidden-variable models.

extending the energy transmission and distribution network. Placement of
powerlines represent a risk for bird population. Hence, better understanding of
deaths induced by powerlines, and the factors behind them are of paramount
importance to reduce the impact of powerlines. To address this concern,
professional surveys and citizen science data are available. While the former
data type is observed in small portions of the space by experts through
expensive standardized sampling protocols, the latter is opportunistically
collected by citizen scientists.
  We set up full Bayesian spatial models that 1) fusion both professional
surveys and citizen science data and 2) explicitly account for preferential
sampling that affects professional surveys data and for factors that affect the
quality of citizen science data. The proposed models are part of the family of
latent Gaussian models as both data types are interpreted as thinned spatial
point patterns and modeled as log-Gaussian Cox processes. The specification of
these models assume the existence of a common latent spatial process underlying
the observation of both data types.
  The proposed models are used both on simulated data and on real-data of
powerline-induced death of birds in the Trondelag in Norway. The simulation
studies clearly show increased accuracy in parameter estimates when both data
types are fusioned and factors that bias their collection processes are
properly accounted for. The study of powerline-induced deaths shows a clear
association between the density of the powerline network and the risk that
powerlines represent for bird populations. The choice of model is relevant for
the conclusions from this case study as different models estimated the
association between risk of powerline-induced deaths and the amount of exposed
birds differently.

a Runge--Kutta method in time, for which the development of parallel solvers is
an emerging research area in the literature of numerical methods for
time-dependent PDEs. By making use of classical theory of block matrices, one
is able to derive a preconditioner for the systems considered. The block
structure of the preconditioner allows for parallelism in the time variable, as
long as one is able to provide an optimal solver for the system of the stages
of the method. We thus propose a preconditioner for the latter system based on
a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the (real) Runge--Kutta matrix
$A_{\mathrm{RK}} = U \Sigma V^\top$. Supposing $A_{\mathrm{RK}}$ is invertible,
we prove that the spectrum of the system for the stages preconditioned by our
SVD-based preconditioner is contained within the right-half of the unit circle,
under suitable assumptions on the matrix $U^\top V$ (the assumptions are well
posed due to the polar decomposition of $A_{\mathrm{RK}}$). We show the
numerical efficiency of our SVD-based preconditioner by solving the system of
the stages arising from the discretization of the heat equation and the Stokes
equations, with sequential time-stepping. Finally, we provide numerical results
of the all-at-once approach for both problems, showing the speed-up achieved on

intermediates in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on a B-doped graphene (BG)
model system where the overpotential is found to reduce by up to 0.6 V due to
solvation. BG is experimentally reported to be an active ORR catalyst but
recent computational estimates using state-of-the-art hybrid density
functionals in the absence of solvation effects have indicated low activity. To
test whether the inclusion of explicit solvation can bring the calculated
activity estimates closer to the experimental reports, up to 4 layers of water
molecules are included in the simulations reported here. The calculations are
based on classical molecular dynamics and local minimization of energy using
atomic forces evaluated from electron density functional theory. Data sets are
obtained from regular and coarse-grained dynamics, as well as local
minimization of structures resampled from dynamics simulations. The results
differ greatly depending on the method used and the solvation energy estimates
and are deemed untrustworthy. It is concluded that a significantly larger
number of water molecules is required to obtain converged results for the
solvation energy. As the present system includes up to 139 atoms, it already
strains the limits of computational feasibility, so this points to the need for
a hybrid simulation approach where efficient simulations of much larger number
of solvent molecules is carried out using a lower level of theory while
retaining the higher level of theory for the reacting molecules as well as

Moreover, given the recent paradigm shift towards transformer-based models, it
is still an open question how coreset selection would impact their performance.
There are several similar intriguing questions that need to be answered for a
wide acceptance of coreset selection methods, and this paper attempts to answer
some of these. We present a systematic benchmarking setup and perform a
rigorous comparison of different coreset selection methods on CNNs and
transformers. Our investigation reveals that under certain circumstances,
random selection of subsets is more robust and stable when compared with the
SOTA selection methods. We demonstrate that the conventional concept of uniform
subset sampling across the various classes of the data is not the appropriate
choice. Rather samples should be adaptively chosen based on the complexity of
the data distribution for each class. Transformers are generally pretrained on
large datasets, and we show that for certain target datasets, it helps to keep
their performance stable at even very small coreset sizes. We further show that
when no pretraining is done or when the pretrained transformer models are used
with non-natural images (e.g. medical data), CNNs tend to generalize better
than transformers at even very small coreset sizes. Lastly, we demonstrate that
in the absence of the right pretraining, CNNs are better at learning the
semantic coherence between spatially distant objects within an image, and these
tend to outperform transformers at almost all choices of the coreset size.

in the field dependence of thermal conductivity, while crystal I, with more
disorder, did not. For crystal I, an L-shaped region in the temperature-field

$\pm$20\% of the half quantized thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{HQ}$/T.
While for crystal II, $\kappa_{xy}$/T reaches $\kappa_{HQ}$/T only in the high

phonons in- and out-of-equilibrium at any temperature. We begin by addressing a
fundamental issue concerning the {\em ab initio} Hamiltonian in the harmonic
approximation, which we show must be determined {\em self-consistently} to
avoid inconsistencies. After identifying the most suitable partitioning into a
``noninteracting'' and an ``interacting'' part we embark on the Green's
function diagrammatic analysis. We single out key diagrammatic structures to
carry on the expansion in terms of dressed propagators and screened
interaction. The final outcome is the finite-temperature nonequilibrium
extension of the Hedin equations, featuring the appearance of the time-local
Ehrenfest diagram in the electronic self-energy. The Hedin equations have
limited practical utility for real-time simulations of driven systems. We
leverage the versatility of diagrammatic expansion to generate a closed system
of integro-differential equations for the Green's functions and nuclear
displacements. These are the Kadanoff-Baym equations for electrons and phonons.
Another advantage of the diagrammatic derivation is the ability to use
conserving approximations, which ensure the satisfaction of all fundamental
conservation laws during the time evolution. As an example we show that the
adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation is not conserving whereas its
dynamical extension is conserving provided that the electrons are treated in
the Fan-Migdal approximation with a dynamically screened electron-phonon
coupling. We also derive the formal solution of the Kadanoff-Baym equations in
the long time limit and at the steady state. The expansion of the phononic
Green's function around the quasi-phonon energies points to a possible
correlation-induced splitting of the phonon dispersion in materials with no
time-reversal invariance.

Pfirsch--Schl\""uter current density when a pressure gradient is present across

nuclear medicine. An area of significant interest has been using deep-learning
(DL)-based approaches for denoising images acquired with lower doses, shorter
acquisition times, or both. Objective evaluation of these approaches is
essential for clinical application. DL-based approaches for denoising
nuclear-medicine images have typically been evaluated using fidelity-based
figures of merit (FoMs) such as RMSE and SSIM. However, these images are
acquired for clinical tasks and thus should be evaluated based on their
performance in these tasks. Our objectives were to (1) investigate whether
evaluation with these FoMs is consistent with objective clinical-task-based
evaluation; (2) provide a theoretical analysis for determining the impact of
denoising on signal-detection tasks; (3) demonstrate the utility of virtual
clinical trials (VCTs) to evaluate DL-based methods. A VCT to evaluate a
DL-based method for denoising myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) images was
conducted. The impact of DL-based denoising was evaluated using fidelity-based
FoMs and AUC, which quantified performance on detecting perfusion defects in
MPS images as obtained using a model observer with anthropomorphic channels.
Based on fidelity-based FoMs, denoising using the considered DL-based method
led to significantly superior performance. However, based on ROC analysis,
denoising did not improve, and in fact, often degraded detection-task
performance. The results motivate the need for objective task-based evaluation
of DL-based denoising approaches. Further, this study shows how VCTs provide a
mechanism to conduct such evaluations using VCTs. Finally, our theoretical
treatment reveals insights into the reasons for the limited performance of the

able to distinguish between the Kerr black hole in general relativity and
alternative black holes that deviate from Kerr. Certain aspects of photon rings
have been argued to be robust observables in Very-Long-Baseline Interferometry
(VLBI) black hole observations which carry imprints of the underlying
spacetime. The photon ring shape, as well as its Lyapunov exponent (which
encodes the narrowing of successive photon subrings), are detailed probes of
the underlying geometry; measurements thereof have been argued to provide a
strong null test of general relativity and the Kerr metric. However, a more
complicated question is whether such observations of the photon ring properties
can distinguish between Kerr and alternative black holes. We provide a first
answer to this question by calculating photon rings of the Johannsen,
Rasheed-Larsen, and Manko-Novikov black holes. We find that large deviations
from Kerr and large observer inclinations are needed to obtain measurable
differences in the photon ring shape. In other words, the Kerr photon ring
shape appears to be the universal shape even for deviating black holes at low
inclinations. On the other hand, the Lyapunov exponent shows more marked
variations for deviations from the Kerr metric. Our analysis lays out the
groundwork to determine deviations from the Kerr spacetime in photon rings that
are potentially detectable by future observing missions.

characterized by internal gradients of shape misfit. Frustrated assemblies have
drawn recent interest due to the unique possibility that their thermodynamics
can sense and select the finite size of assembly at length scales much larger
than constituent building blocks or their interactions. At present,
self-limitation is chiefly understood to derive from zero-temperature
considerations, specifically the competition between cohesion and
scale-dependent elastic costs of frustration. While effects of entropy and
finite temperature fluctuations are necessarily significant for self-assembling
systems, their impact on the self-limiting states of frustrated assemblies is
not known. We introduce a generic, minimal model of frustrated assembly, and
establish its finite-temperature and concentration dependent thermodynamics by
way of simulation and continuum theory. The phase diagram is marked by three
distinct states of translation order: a dispersed vapor; a defect-riddled
condensate; and the self-limiting aggregate state. We show that, at finite
temperature, the self-limiting state is stable at intermediate frustration.
Further, in contrast to the prevailing picture, its thermodynamic boundaries
with the macroscopic disperse and bulk states are temperature controlled,

  Using Attention and Self-Supervision",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A large body of previous machine learning methods for ultrasound-based
prostate cancer detection classify small regions of interest (ROIs) of
ultrasound signals that lie within a larger needle trace corresponding to a
prostate tissue biopsy (called biopsy core). These ROI-scale models suffer from
weak labeling as histopathology results available for biopsy cores only
approximate the distribution of cancer in the ROIs. ROI-scale models do not
take advantage of contextual information that are normally considered by
pathologists, i.e. they do not consider information about surrounding tissue
and larger-scale trends when identifying cancer. We aim to improve cancer
detection by taking a multi-scale, i.e. ROI-scale and biopsy core-scale,
approach. Methods: Our multi-scale approach combines (i) an ""ROI-scale"" model
trained using self-supervised learning to extract features from small ROIs and
(ii) a ""core-scale"" transformer model that processes a collection of extracted
features from multiple ROIs in the needle trace region to predict the tissue
type of the corresponding core. Attention maps, as a byproduct, allow us to
localize cancer at the ROI scale. We analyze this method using a dataset of
micro-ultrasound acquired from 578 patients who underwent prostate biopsy, and
compare our model to baseline models and other large-scale studies in the
literature. Results and Conclusions: Our model shows consistent and substantial
performance improvements compared to ROI-scale-only models. It achieves 80.3%
AUROC, a statistically significant improvement over ROI-scale classification.
We also compare our method to large studies on prostate cancer detection, using
other imaging modalities. Our code is publicly available at

applications, such as robotic grasping, autonomous driving, and augmented
reality. However, this task becomes more challenging in poor lighting
conditions or when dealing with textureless objects. To address this issue,
depth images are becoming an increasingly popular choice due to their
invariance to a scene's appearance and the implicit incorporation of essential
geometric characteristics. However, fully leveraging depth information to
improve the performance of pose estimation remains a difficult and
under-investigated problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel
framework called SwinDePose, that uses only geometric information from depth
images to achieve accurate 6D pose estimation. SwinDePose first calculates the
angles between each normal vector defined in a depth image and the three
coordinate axes in the camera coordinate system. The resulting angles are then
formed into an image, which is encoded using Swin Transformer. Additionally, we
apply RandLA-Net to learn the representations from point clouds. The resulting
image and point clouds embeddings are concatenated and fed into a semantic
segmentation module and a 3D keypoints localization module. Finally, we
estimate 6D poses using a least-square fitting approach based on the target
object's predicted semantic mask and 3D keypoints. In experiments on the
LineMod and Occlusion LineMod datasets, SwinDePose outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods for 6D object pose estimation using depth images. This
demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and highlights its potential for
improving performance in real-world scenarios. Our code is at

the proprietary STD and EXTRA heuristic filters provided by our EyeLink 1000

impulse response (IIR) filter (low-pass Butterworth), and a finite impulse
filter (FIR). For each of the non-heuristic filters, we systematically searched
for optimal parameters. Both the IIR and the FIR filters were zero-phase
filters. Mean frequency response profiles and amplitude spectra for all 5
filters are provided. In addition, we examined the effect of our filters on a
noisy recording. Our FIR filter had the sharpest roll-off of any filter.
Therefore, it maintained the signal and removed noise more effectively than any
other filter. On this basis, we recommend the use of our FIR filter. Several
reports have shown that filtering increased the temporal autocorrelation of a

autocorrelation (specifically the first 3 lags). Of all our filters, the STD

observability, which is commonly modeled as partially observable Markov
decision processes (POMDPs). However, traditional POMDP models rely on the
assumption of complete knowledge of the observation source, known as fully
observable data association. To address this limitation, we propose a planning
algorithm that maintains multiple data association hypotheses, represented as a
belief mixture, where each component corresponds to a different data
association hypothesis. However, this method can lead to an exponential growth
in the number of hypotheses, resulting in significant computational overhead.
To overcome this challenge, we introduce a pruning-based approach for planning
with ambiguous data associations. Our key contribution is to derive bounds
between the value function based on the complete set of hypotheses and the
value function based on a pruned-subset of the hypotheses, enabling us to
establish a trade-off between computational efficiency and performance. We
demonstrate how these bounds can both be used to certify any pruning heuristic
in retrospect and propose a novel approach to determine which hypotheses to
prune in order to ensure a predefined limit on the loss. We evaluate our
approach in simulated environments and demonstrate its efficacy in handling
multi-modal belief hypotheses with ambiguous data associations.

and pressure-supported galaxies ($0.10<D/T<0.77$). In a minority of cases, the
GSE-like debris is comprised of stars from more than one merger progenitor.
However, there is a close similarity in their chemodynamical property
distributions and the triaxial shapes of their debris are comparable around the
Solar radius, so it is not always possible to distinguish their debris. The
merger progenitors host a variety of luminous satellites ($0-8$ with
$M_{*}>10^6\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$), but most of these do not follow the merger to
low orbital energies. Between $0-1$ of these satellites may survive to $z=0$,
but with no clear signatures of their past association. We show that the
fraction of stars originating from GSE-like mergers is reduced for lower
metallicities (reaching a minimum around $\text{[Fe/H]} = -2$), and also within
$5\,$kpc of the galactic centre. Whilst these central regions are dominated by
$\textit{in-situ}$ stars, the $\textit{ex-situ}$ fraction trends towards a 100
per cent asymptote when considering the most metal-poor stars

to take full advantage of the learned knowledge. Specifically, we prompt the
denoising decoder with proper textual inputs and refine the text features with
an adapter, leading to a better alignment to the pre-trained stage and making
the visual contents interact with the text prompts. We also propose to utilize
the cross-attention maps between the visual features and the text features to

that vision-language pre-trained diffusion models can be faster adapted to

Separately, these features have allowed for the creation of curved-space
lattices and the realization of strongly correlated phases and dynamics in
one-dimensional chains and square lattices. Missing in this suite of
simulations is the simultaneous integration of interacting particles into
lattices with unique band dispersions, such as dispersionless flat bands. An
ideal building block for flat-band physics is the Aharonov-Bohm cage: a single
plaquette of a lattice whose band structure consists entirely of flat bands.
Here, we experimentally construct an Aharonov-Bohm cage and observe the
localization of a single photon, the hallmark of all-bands-flat physics. Upon
placing an interaction-bound photon pair into the cage, we see a delocalized
walk indicating an escape from Aharonov-Bohm caging. We further find that a
variation of caging persists for two particles initialized on opposite sites of
the cage. These results mark the first experimental work where interacting
particles circumvent an Aharonov-Bohm cage and establish superconducting

produces feedback that shuts off accretion and thus leads to episodic flaring.
While these assumptions are highly uncertain at present, they predict a
breakout emission characterized by luminous thermal emission in the X-ray

gamma-ray bands. The flare duration depends on the BH's distance $r$ from the
central supermassive BH, varying between $10^3-10^6$ s for $r \sim 0.01-1$ pc.

electron-electron interaction mediated by a boson that couples to an electronic
transition between two bands separated by a band gap. While this attraction is
small in equilibrium, we find that it can be increased by several orders of

enhancement is further amplified when the boson is near-resonant to the

ideal candidate for efficient photo-induced superconductivity. We first use
exact diagonalisation calculations of a two-site model to prove that pairing is
indeed resonantly enhanced out-of equilibrium. We then investigate the
potential of this mechanism to increase the superconducting transition

resonantly amplified when the bosons are in a nonthermal state. We argue that

the system no longer develops long-range correlations. To probe the
thermalization-to-localization transition further, we define a frequency gap
ratio that measures adjacent gaps in the phase space eigenvalues of the

find signatures of a chaotic regime at intermediate disorder in two spatial

would localize for arbitrarily small disorder in the continuum in both one and

Additionally, radial extension of `analytically-described' disc zones is not

around compact objects, with and without external irradiation, with radiative
and convective energy transport taken into account. For this, we introduce a
new open Python code, allowing different equations of state (EoS) and opacity

`S-curves' are calculated for specific disc parameters and chemical
composition. In particular, based on more accurate power-law approximations for
opacity in the disc, we supply new analytic formulas for the farthest regions
of the hot disc around stellar-mass object. On calculating vertical structure
of a self-irradiated disc, we calculate a self-consistent value of the
irradiation parameter $C_{\rm irr}$ for stationary $\alpha$-disc. We find that,
for a fixed shape of the X-ray spectrum, $C_{\rm irr}$ depends weakly on the
accretion rate but changes with radius, and the dependence is driven by the
conditions in the photosphere and disc opening angle. The hot zone extent
depends on the ratio between irradiating and intrinsic flux: corresponding

typical of the WIM. These detections are broadly consistent with expectations
of physical models for the WIM. The current detections are limited by
uncorrected fringing (and to a lesser extent by baseline variations). In due
course, we expect, as with other IFUs, the calibration pipeline to deliver
photon-noise-limited spectra. The detections reported here bode well for the
study of the WIM. Along most lines-of-sight hour-long MIRI-MRS observations
should detect line emission from the WIM. When combined with optical
observations by modern IFUs with high spectral resolution on large ground-based
telescopes, the ionization fraction and temperature of neon and sulfur can be
robustly inferred. Separately, the ionization of helium in the WIM can be
probed by NIRspec. Finally, joint JWST and optical IFU studies will open up a
new cottage industry of studying the WIM on arcsecond scales.

random network, where the first layer represents the households, while the
second layer models the contacts outside the households by a random scale-free
graph. We build a three-parameter graph, called polynomial model, where the new
vertices are connected to the existing ones either uniformly, or
preferentially, or by forming random triangles. We examine the effect of the
graph's properties on the goodness of the estimation of the infection rate
$\tau$. In the classical approach, to estimate $\tau$ one needs to approximate
the number of SI edges between households, since the graph itself is supposed
to be unobservable. Our simulation study reveals that the estimation is poorer
at the beginning of the epidemic, for larger preferential attachment parameter
of the graph, and for larger $\tau$. We can improve the estimate either by (i)
adjusting it by a graph-dependent factor at a fixed time in the earlier phase
of the epidemic, or (ii) by applying a shift in the estimation of the SI edges.
Furthermore, we establish our method to be robust to changes in average
clustering of the graph model. We also extend a graph neural network (GNN)
approach for estimating contagion dynamics for our two-layered graphs. We find
that dense networks offer better training datasets. Moreover, GNN perfomance is
measured better using the $l_2$ loss function rather than cross-entropy.

conditional on an individual's characteristics and longitudinal history is an
essential problem in precision medicine. This is challenging in practice
because outcomes and treatment assignment mechanisms are unknown in
observational studies, an individual's treatment efficacy is a counterfactual,
and the existence of selection bias is often unavoidable.
  We propose a Bayesian framework for identifying subgroup counterfactual
benefits of dynamic treatment regimes by adapting Bayesian g-computation
algorithm (J. Robins, 1986; Zhou, Elliott, & Little, 2019) to incorporate
multivariate generalized linear mixed-effects models. Unmeasured time-invariant
factors are identified as subject-specific random effects in the assumed joint
distribution of outcomes, time-varying confounders, and treatment assignments.
Existing methods mostly assume no unmeasured confounding and focus on balancing
the observed confounder distributions between different treatments, while our
method allows the presence of time-invariant unmeasured confounding. We propose
a sequential ignorability assumption based on treatment assignment
heterogeneity, which is analogous to balancing the latent tendency toward each
treatment due to unmeasured time-invariant factors beyond the observables. We
use simulation studies to assess the sensitivity of the proposed method's
performance to various model assumptions. The method is applied to
observational clinical data to investigate the efficacy of continuously using
mycophenolate in different subgroups of scleroderma patients who were treated

users can use it to make arrays and then copy them to Python without any

uncertainties using flexible, adaptable, and adjustable prediction intervals

Simulation (QHiFFS) algorithm as a method for simulating the dynamics of
fast-driven Floquet systems on quantum hardware. Central to QHiFFS is the
concept of a kick operator which transforms the system into a basis where the
dynamics is governed by a time-independent effective Hamiltonian. This allows
prior methods for time-independent Hamiltonian simulation to be lifted to the
simulation of Floquet systems. We use the periodically driven biaxial
next-nearest neighbor Ising (BNNNI) model as a case study to illustrate our
algorithm. This oft-studied model is a natural test bed for quantum frustrated
magnetism and criticality. We successfully implemented a 20-qubit simulation of
the driven two-dimensional BNNNI model on Quantinuum's trapped ion quantum
computer. This is complemented with an analysis of QHiFFS algorithmic errors.
Our study indicates that the algorithm exhibits not only a cubic scaling
advantage in driving frequency $\omega$ but also a linear one in simulation
time $t$ compared to Trotterisation, making it an interesting avenue to push
towards near-term quantum advantage.

The model incorporates a novel approach to describing the growing front of a

the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class when growth in the system is
bulk driven. Interestingly, we also find the emergence of a previously

excited atom is an extremely complex problem so various approximations are
typically used. One of the most popular ones is the use of the dipole
approximation of a two-level atom followed by rotating wave approximation
(RWA). However, such an approach applied to the entire frequency spectrum
results in the appearance of divergent integrals in the derivations, which are
not treated rigorously in typical student textbooks. It is known from the
literature that the introduction of cutoff for frequencies, justified by the
finite size of the atom, may solve this problem. For didactic purposes, in this
paper, we introduce a mathematically simple cutoff, which allows for a
straightforward yet mathematically consistent rederivation of the
Weisskopf-Wigner spontaneous emission rate (up to the small correction) within
RWA. Importantly, this cutoff is not a mathematical trick to make calculations
easier but is related to a real feature of the physical system, the neglect of
which leads to inconsistency. More precise analysis demand going beyond RWA and
dipole approximation.

models acting as reward functions between the expert and the agent policy based
on Lyapunov stability theory. Our LfO training process consists of two steps.
The first step attempts to learn a Lyapunov-like landscape proxy model from
expert state sequences without access to any kinematics model, and the second
step uses the learned landscape model to guide in training the learner's
policy. We formulate novel learning objectives for the two steps that are
important for overall training success. We evaluate our methods in real

In this work, we propose denoise pre-training on non-equilibrium molecular

added to atomic coordinates of sampled non-equilibrium conformations. Rigorous
experiments on multiple benchmarks reveal that pre-training significantly
improves the accuracy of neural potentials. Furthermore, we show that the
proposed pre-training approach is model-agnostic, as it improves the
performance of different invariant and equivariant GNNs. Notably, our models
pre-trained on small molecules demonstrate remarkable transferability,
improving performance when fine-tuned on diverse molecular systems, including
different elements, charged molecules, biomolecules, and larger systems. These
results highlight the potential for leveraging denoise pre-training approaches

materials that support an interplay between topology and interactions are

non-trivial cubic double Dirac metal EuPd3S4 undergoes long-range charge
ordering at TCO = 340 K wherein Eu ions on a body-centered-cubic lattice divide
into interpenetrating simple cubic lattices, one occupied by magnetic Eu2+ the
other by non-magnetic Eu3+. The reduced symmetry transmutes the 8-fold double
Dirac states into 4-fold Dirac states and leads to the formation of an
isotropic simple cubic Heisenberg antiferromagnet (AFM) that subsequently
develops G-type AFM order at TN = 2.85(6) K. While time reversal symmetry is
broken at this second order phase transition, its combination with the nearest
neighbor lattice translation forms a non-symmorphic symmetry operation that
preserves the 4-fold Dirac point. Application of a magnetic field at low

charge ordered state. Our work demonstrates how the collective phenomena of

itself perturbs the bath, which is predicted to result in a characteristic
response in the sensing measurements. Here, we observe this bath perturbation,
also known as a quantum quench, by preparing the nuclear spin bath of a
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in polarized initial states and performing
phase-resolved spin echo measurements on the NV electron spin. These
measurements reveal a time-dependent phase determined by the initial state of
the bath. We derive the relationship between sensor phase and Gaussian spin
bath polarization, and apply it to reconstruct both the axial and transverse
polarization components. Using this insight, we optimize the transfer
efficiency of our dynamic nuclear polarization sequence. This technique for
directly measuring bath polarization may assist in preparing high-fidelity
quantum memory states, improving nanoscale NMR methods, and investigating
non-Gaussian quantum baths.

distinct components, (ii) off-load the simple dynamics parts into the
simulation, and (iii) multiply these virtual parts to generate more data in
hindsight. Our new method, Hindsight States (HiS), uses this data and selects
the most useful transitions for training. It can be used with an arbitrary
off-policy algorithm. We validate our method on several challenging simulated
tasks and demonstrate that it improves learning both alone and when combined
with an existing hindsight algorithm, Hindsight Experience Replay (HER).

homomorphic encryption (HE) and lattice-based cryptosystems. This paper
addresses low-latency hardware architectures for long polynomial modular
multiplication using the number-theoretic transform (NTT) and inverse NTT
(iNTT). Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) is used to decompose the modulus into
multiple smaller moduli. Our proposed architecture, namely PaReNTT, makes four
novel contributions. First, parallel NTT and iNTT architectures are proposed to
reduce the number of clock cycles to process the polynomials. This can enable
real-time processing for HE applications, as the number of clock cycles to
process the polynomial is inversely proportional to the level of parallelism.
Second, the proposed architecture eliminates the need for permuting the NTT
outputs before their product is input to the iNTT. This reduces latency by n/4
clock cycles, where n is the length of the polynomial, and reduces buffer
requirement by one delay-switch-delay circuit of size n. Third, an approach to
select special moduli is presented where the moduli can be expressed in terms
of a few signed power-of-two terms. Fourth, novel architectures for
pre-processing for computing residual polynomials using the CRT and
post-processing for combining the residual polynomials are proposed. These
architectures significantly reduce the area consumption of the pre-processing
and post-processing steps. The proposed long modular polynomial multiplications
are ideal for applications that require low latency and high sample rate as
these feed-forward architectures can be pipelined at arbitrary levels.

find a three-fold jump in the N\'{e}el temperature and a sign change in the

Using neutron scattering, we reveal a change of the ground-state from spiral
order in FeCl$_3$ to A-type antiferromagnetic order in FeBr$_3$. Using
first-principles calculations, we show that a delicate balance between nearest

These results support the proximity of FeCl$_3$ to a spiral spin liquid state,
in which competing interactions and nearly degenerate magnetic $k$-vectors may
cause large changes in response to small perturbations.

introduces an optimal transport (OT) loss, that extends adversarial methods
that penalize models if images from different institutions can be distinguished

global differences in color distribution, only our OT loss can reliably

suggest that OT improves generalization on rare but critical phenotypes that

various personality traits (Five Factor Model, regulatory focus, and
narcissism) of developers and the introduction and removal of TD. To this end,
we complement an existing TD dataset with novel self-report personality data
gathered by surveying developers, and analyze 2,145 commits from 19 developers.
Results: We find that conscientiousness, emotional stability, openness to
experience, and prevention focus are negatively associated with TD. There were
no significant results for extraversion, agreeableness, promotion focus, or
narcissism. Conclusions: We take our results as first evidence that developer
personality has a systematic influence on the introduction and removal of TD.
This has implications not only for future research, which could, for example,
study the effects of personality on downstream consequences of TD like defects,
but also for software engineering practitioners who may, for example, consider
developer personality in staffing decisions.

the highest priority space mission related to asteroid mitigation. NASA's
Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission is the first full-scale test of
kinetic impact technology. The mission's target asteroid was Dimorphos, the
secondary member of the S-type binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos. This
binary asteroid system was chosen to enable ground-based telescopes to quantify
the asteroid deflection caused by DART's impact. While past missions have

perturbations. Surprisingly, overfitting is a major concern in adversarial
training despite being mostly absent in standard training. We provide here
theoretical evidence for this peculiar ""robust overfitting"" phenomenon.
Subsequently, we advance a novel distributionally robust loss function bridging
robustness and generalization. We demonstrate both theoretically as well as
empirically the loss to enjoy a certified level of robustness against two
common types of corruption--data evasion and poisoning attacks--while ensuring
guaranteed generalization. We show through careful numerical experiments that
our resulting holistic robust (HR) training procedure yields SOTA performance.
Finally, we indicate that HR training can be interpreted as a direct extension
of adversarial training and comes with a negligible additional computational
burden. A ready-to-use python library implementing our algorithm is available
at https://github.com/RyanLucas3/HR_Neural_Networks.

we provide some negative results for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for ReLU

observables of the Floquet graphene antidot lattice, which we introduced
previously [Phys. Rev. B 104, 174304 (2021)]. On the basis of Floquet linear
response theory, the real and imaginary parts of the longitudinal and Hall
optical conductivity are computed as a function of probe frequency. We find
that the number and positions of peaks in the response function are distinctive
of the different Floquet electronic phases, and identify multiple properties
with no equilibrium analog. First, for several intervals of probe frequencies,
the real part of the conductivity becomes negative, which we argue is
indicative of negative Joule heating. That is, the Floquet drive causes the
material to amplify the power of the probe (gain). Additionally, while there is
zero Hall response at equilibrium, the real and imaginary parts of the Floquet
Hall conductivity are non-zero and can be as large as the longitudinal
components. Lastly, driving-induced localization tends to reduce the overall
magnitude of and to flatten out the optical conductivity signal. From an
implementation standpoint, a major advantage of the antidot lattice is that the
above-bandwidth driving limit is reached with photon energies that are at least
twenty times lower than that required for the intrinsic material, allowing for
significant band renormalization at orders-of-magnitude smaller intensities.
Our work provides the necessary tools for experimentalists to map reflectance

the most extreme stellar systems, including black holes that may dynamically
assemble into merging binaries (BBHs). Uncertain GC properties, including when
they formed, their initial masses and sizes, affect their production rate of
BBH mergers. Using the gravitational-wave catalog GWTC-3, we measure that
dynamically-assembled BBHs -- those that are consistent with isotropic spin
directions -- make up ${61^{+29}_{-44}\%}$ of the total merger rate, with a
local merger rate of ${10.9^{+16.8}_{-9.3}}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ rising to
${58.9^{+149.4}_{-46.0}}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at $z = 1$. We assume this
inferred rate describes the contribution from GCs and compare it against the
Cluster Monte Carlo (CMC) simulation catalog to directly fit for the GC initial
mass function, virial radius distribution, and formation history. We find that
GC initial masses are consistent with a Schechter function with slope ${\beta_m
= -1.9^{+0.8}_{-0.8}}$. Assuming a mass function slope of $\beta_m = -2$ and a
mass range between $10^4$--$10^8\,M_\odot$, we infer a GC formation rate at $z

${2.1^{+3.9}_{-1.7}}\times 10^6\,M_\odot$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ in terms of mass
density. We find that the GC formation rate probably rises more steeply than
the global star formation rate between $z = 0$ and $z = 3$ ({82\%} credibility)
and implies a local number density that is ${f_\mathrm{ev} =
22.6^{+29.9}_{-16.2}}$ times higher than the observed density of survived GCs.
This is consistent with expectations for cluster evaporation, but may suggest
that other environments contribute to the rate of BBH mergers with
significantly tilted spins.

to cognitive biases or lack of information, people do not perform very well --
how could an agent influence them towards more optimal behavior? Assuming
near-optimal human behavior will not work here, and so the agent needs to learn

investigated the most straightforward error mitigation strategy using the

of fermionic quantum simulation. We numerically investigate the performance of
the error mitigation strategy on a range of systems containing up to 42 qubits
and on a number of fundamental quantum simulation tasks including
non-equilibrium dynamics and variational ground state calculations. We find
that at reasonable noise rates and system sizes, the fidelity of computations
can be increased significantly beyond what can be achieved with the standard
Jordan-Wigner transformation at the cost of increasing the number of shots by
less than a factor of 10, potentially providing a meaningful boost to near-term
quantum simulations. Our simulations are enabled by new classical simulation
algorithms that scale with the logical Hilbert space dimension rather than the

a continuous value for a given input. Task-specialized approaches for training
regression networks have shown significant improvement over generic approaches,
such as direct regression. More recently, a generic approach based on
regression by binary classification using binary-encoded labels has shown
significant improvement over direct regression. The space of label encodings
for regression is large. Lacking heretofore have been automated approaches to
find a good label encoding for a given application. This paper introduces
Regularized Label Encoding Learning (RLEL) for end-to-end training of an entire
network and its label encoding. RLEL provides a generic approach for tackling
regression. Underlying RLEL is our observation that the search space of label
encodings can be constrained and efficiently explored by using a continuous
search space of real-valued label encodings combined with a regularization
function designed to encourage encodings with certain properties. These
properties balance the probability of classification error in individual bits
against error correction capability. Label encodings found by RLEL result in
lower or comparable errors to manually designed label encodings. Applying RLEL
results in 10.9% and 12.4% improvement in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) over direct
regression and multiclass classification, respectively. Our evaluation
demonstrates that RLEL can be combined with off-the-shelf feature extractors

confining potentials that support exact, constant density kovaton solutions to
the classical Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) also known as the nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation (NLSE). In the one-dimensional case, the exact solution
is the sum of stationary kink and anti-kink solutions, i.e. a kovaton, and in
the overlapping region, the density is constant. In higher dimensions, the
exact solutions are generalizations of this wave function. In the absence of
self-interactions, the confining potential is similar to a smoothed out finite
square well with minima also at the edges. When self-interactions are added, a
term proportional to $\pm g \psi^{\ast}\psi$ gets added to the confining
potential and $\pm g M$, where $M$ is the norm, gets added to the total energy.
In the realm of stability analysis, we find (linearly) stable solutions in the
case with repulsive self-interactions which also are stable to self-similar
deformations. For attractive interactions, however, the minima at the edges of
the potential get deeper and a barrier in the center forms as we increase the
norm. This leads to instabilities at a critical value of $M$ (related to the
number of particles in the BEC). Comparing the stability criteria from
Derrick's theorem and Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis stability results, we find
that both predict stability for repulsive self-interactions and instability at
a critical mass $M$ for attractive interactions. However, the numerical
analysis gives a much lower critical mass. The numerical analysis shows further
that the initial instabilities violate the symmetry $x\rightarrow-x$ assumed by
Derrick's theorem.

a new method, called Federated Virtual Learning on Heterogeneous Data with

the same amount of balanced local virtual data; to harmonize the domain shifts,
we use federated gradient matching to distill global virtual data that are
shared with clients without hindering data privacy to rectify heterogeneous
local training via enforcing local-global feature similarity. We experiment on
both benchmark and real-world datasets that contain heterogeneous data from
different sources, and further scale up to an FL scenario that contains large
number of clients with heterogeneous and class imbalance data. Our method
outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous FL algorithms under various settings

a robust alternative to structural APTG techniques. However, the high cost of
transforming a circuit testing problem to a Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)
limits the application of SAT in industrial ATPG scenarios, resulting in a loss
of test coverage. In Order to address this problem, this paper proposes a
conflict-driven structural learning (CDSL) ATPG algorithm firstly, in which the
conflict-driven heuristic methods in modern SAT solver are implemented on the
logic cone of fault propagation and activation directly. The proposed CDSL
algorithm is composed of three parts: (1) According to the implication graph,
various conflict constraints have been learned to prune search space. (2)
Conflict-driven implication and justification have been applied to increase
decision accuracy and solving efficiency. (3) A conflict-based diagnosis method
is further proposed in the case of low coverage debug, leading to making the
aborted faults testable by relaxing or modifying some constraints on primary
inputs. Extensive experimental results on industrial circuits demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CDSL algorithm. It is shown that
compared with the SAT-based ATPG, the proposed CDSL can on average decrease
$25.6\%$ aborted faults with $94.51\%$ less run time. With a two-stage
computational flow, it has shown that the proposed CDSL can lead to $46.37\%$
less aborted faults than a one-stage structural algorithm, further with the
$3.19\%$ improvement on fault coverage. In addition, the conflict diagnosis can
lead to $8.89\%$ less aborted faults on average, and $0.271\%$ improvement in
fault coverage rate.

forces due to the distributed contact between their skin and the ground, it is
essential to investigate the locomotion gaits through efficient dynamic models

spatial dynamic model that utilizes a floating-base kinematic model with
distributed contact dynamics for a pneumatically powered soft robotic snake. We
numerically evaluate the feasibility of the planar and spatial rolling gaits

carried out based on the Lifshitz theory. The variations of Casimir forces due
to the DNA thicknesses, volume fractions of containing water, covering media
and substrates are investigated. For a DNA film suspended in the air or water,
the Casimir force is attractive, and its magnitude increases with decreasing
the thickness of DNA films and the water volume fraction. For DNA films
deposited on a dielectric(silica) substrate, the Casimir force is attractive
for the air environment. However, the Casimir force shows unusual features in a
water environment. Under specific conditions, switching signs of the Casimir
force from attractive to repulsive can be achieved by increasing the DNA-film
thickness. Finally, the Casimir force for DNA films deposited on a metallic
substrate are investigated. The Casimir force is dominant by the repulsive
interactions at a small DNA-film thickness for both the air and water
environment. In a water environment, the Casimir force turns out to be
attractive at a large DNA-film thickness, and a stable Casimir equilibrium can
be found. In addition to the adhesion stability, our finding could be
applicable to the problems of condensation and de-condensation of DNA, due to
the fluctuation-induced dispersion forces.

to be powered by the strong magnetic field in a neutron star. For a very strong
magnetic field, elastic deformation becomes excessively large such that it
leads to crustal failure. We studied the evolutionary process driven by the
Hall drift for a magnetic field confined inside the crust. Assuming that the
elastic force acts against the Lorentz force, we examined the duration of the
elastic regime and maximum elastic energy stored before the critical state. The
breakup time was longer than that required for extending the field to the
exterior, because the tangential components of the Lorentz force vanished in
the fragile surface region. The conversion of large magnetic energy, confined
to the interior, into Joule heat is considered to explain the power for central
compact objects. This process can function without reaching its elastic limit,
unless the magnetic energy exceeds $2\times 10^{47}$ erg, which requires an
average field strength of $2\times10^{15}$ G. Thus, the strong magnetic field
hidden in the crust is unlikely to cause outbursts. Furthermore, the magnetic
field configuration can discriminate between central compact objects and
magnetars.

fuses RGB images and LiDAR data by depth completion has gained great attention.
However, virtual points generated from an image are very dense, introducing a
huge amount of redundant computation during detection. Meanwhile, noises
brought by inaccurate depth completion significantly degrade detection
precision. This paper proposes a fast yet effective backbone, termed
VirConvNet, based on a new operator VirConv (Virtual Sparse Convolution), for
virtual-point-based 3D object detection. VirConv consists of two key designs:
(1) StVD (Stochastic Voxel Discard) and (2) NRConv (Noise-Resistant Submanifold
Convolution). StVD alleviates the computation problem by discarding large
amounts of nearby redundant voxels. NRConv tackles the noise problem by
encoding voxel features in both 2D image and 3D LiDAR space. By integrating
VirConv, we first develop an efficient pipeline VirConv-L based on an early
fusion design. Then, we build a high-precision pipeline VirConv-T based on a
transformed refinement scheme. Finally, we develop a semi-supervised pipeline
VirConv-S based on a pseudo-label framework. On the KITTI car 3D detection test
leaderboard, our VirConv-L achieves 85% AP with a fast running speed of 56ms.
Our VirConv-T and VirConv-S attains a high-precision of 86.3% and 87.2% AP, and
currently rank 2nd and 1st, respectively. The code is available at

region 12936 located in the northeast quadrant (N18E06) of the Sun. The
eruption was marked by an M1.1 flare, which started at 22:45 UT, peaked at
23:32 UT on January 29 and ended at 00:24 UT the next day. The CME ended up as
a shock-driving magnetic cloud (MC) observed at Sun-Earth L1 and at
STEREO-Ahead (STA) located about 34 deg behind Earth. The geomagnetic storm was
caused by a strong southward component of the MC that was boosted by a high
speed solar wind stream behind the MC. Even though Earth and STA were separated
by only about 34 deg, the MC appeared quite different at Earth and L1. One
possibility is that the MC was writhed reflecting the curved neutral line at
the Sun. In-situ observations suggest that the MC was heading closer to STA
than to Earth because of the earlier arrival at STA. However, the shock arrived
at STA and Earth around the same time, suggesting a weaker shock at Earth due

magnonics constitute a rich source of various nontrivial effects in optics and
quantum information processing. In cavity magnonics, the nonlinear cross-Kerr
effect, which shifts the cavity's central frequency when a magnetic material is
pumped, causes the system to exhibit both Kittle and magnetostatic modes. Here,
we propose a new scheme for the investigation of probe fields transmission
profiles in cavity magnonic systems composed of a microwave cavity and a
ferromagnetic material (Yttrium iron garnet sphere). We report single-to-double
magnon-induced transparency (MIT) dips and a sharp magnon-induced absorption
(MIA) peak, and demonstrate how nonlinear cross- and self-Kerr interactions can
significantly enhance or suppress these phenomena. It is observed that the
splitting of the MIT window occurs when we incorporate magnon-magnon modes
coupling, which helps introducing a new degree of freedom to light-matter
interaction problems. Moreover, we investigate the propagation of group delay
in the vicinity of transparency and demonstrate how a sharp dip allows the
realization of slow light for a longer period of time. We found that both the
cavity-Kittle and magnon-magnon modes coupling parameters influence the
propagation of group delay, which demonstrates how subluminal-to-superluminal
(and vice versa) propagation phenomena may occur and transform. These findings

recognition research. Explaining what patterns are discovered from training
data, and how patterns are generalized to unseen data are instrumental to
understanding and advancing the pattern recognition methods. Unfortunately, the
vast majority of the application domains deal with continuous data (i.e.
statistical in nature) out of which extracted patterns can not be formally
defined. For example, in image classification, there does not exist a principle
definition for a label of cat or dog. Even in natural language, the meaning of
a word can vary with the context it is surrounded by. Unlike the aforementioned
data format, programs are a unique data structure with a well-defined syntax
and semantics, which creates a golden opportunity to formalize what models have
learned from source code. This paper presents the first formal definition of
patterns discovered by code summarization models (i.e. models that predict the
name of a method given its body), and gives a sound algorithm to infer a
context-free grammar (CFG) that formally describes the learned patterns.
  We realize our approach in PATIC which produces CFGs for summarizing the
patterns discovered by code summarization models. In particular, we pick two
prominent instances, code2vec and code2seq, to evaluate PATIC. PATIC shows that
the patterns extracted by each model are heavily restricted to local, and
syntactic code structures with little to none semantic implication. Based on
these findings, we present two example uses of the formal definition of
patterns: a new method for evaluating the robustness and a new technique for
improving the accuracy of code summarization models.
  Our work opens up this exciting, new direction of studying what models have
learned from source code.

model proposed by Gautrais et al. (Annales Zoologici Fennici, 2008). The high
nonlinearity of the model attributed to its attraction/alignment/repulsion law
suggests the need to use MPC for controlling the fish schooling's motion.
However, for large schools, the hybrid nature of the law can make it
numerically demanding to perform finite-horizon optimizations in MPC.
Therefore, this paper proposes reducing the fish schooling model for
numerically efficient MPC; the reduction is based on using the weighted average
of the directions of individual fish in the school. We analytically show how
using the normalized eigenvector centrality of the alignment-interaction
network can yield a better reduction by comparing reduction errors. We confirm
this finding on the weight and numerical efficiency of the MPC with the
reduced-order model by numerical simulations. The proposed reduction allows us
to control a school with up to 500 individuals. Further, we confirm that
reduction with the normalized eigenvector centrality allows us to improve the
control accuracy by factor of five when compared to that using constant
weights.

is typically limited: it is computationally costly (or even impossible) to
numerically generate at high Reynolds numbers, while experimental data is also
expensive to produce and might only include sparse/aggregate flow measurements.
Thus, only a relatively small number of geometries and physical regimes will
realistically be included in any training dataset. Limited data can lead to
overfitting and therefore inaccurate predictions for geometries and physical
regimes that are different from the training cases. We develop a new online
training method for deep learning closure models in LES which seeks to address
this challenge. The deep learning closure model is dynamically trained during a
large-eddy simulation (LES) calculation using embedded direct numerical
simulation (DNS) data. That is, in a small subset of the domain, the flow is
computed at DNS resolutions in concert with the LES prediction. The closure
model then adjusts its approximation to the unclosed terms using data from the

  Representations (ICLR 2023)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Invariant risk minimization (IRM) has received increasing attention as a way
to acquire environment-agnostic data representations and predictions, and as a
principled solution for preventing spurious correlations from being learned and
for improving models' out-of-distribution generalization. Yet, recent works
have found that the optimality of the originally-proposed IRM optimization
(IRM) may be compromised in practice or could be impossible to achieve in some
scenarios. Therefore, a series of advanced IRM algorithms have been developed
that show practical improvement over IRM. In this work, we revisit these recent
IRM advancements, and identify and resolve three practical limitations in IRM
training and evaluation. First, we find that the effect of batch size during
training has been chronically overlooked in previous studies, leaving room for
further improvement. We propose small-batch training and highlight the
improvements over a set of large-batch optimization techniques. Second, we find
that improper selection of evaluation environments could give a false sense of
invariance for IRM. To alleviate this effect, we leverage diversified test-time
environments to precisely characterize the invariance of IRM when applied in
practice. Third, we revisit (Ahuja et al. (2020))'s proposal to convert IRM
into an ensemble game and identify a limitation when a single invariant
predictor is desired instead of an ensemble of individual predictors. We
propose a new IRM variant to address this limitation based on a novel viewpoint
of ensemble IRM games as consensus-constrained bi-level optimization. Lastly,
we conduct extensive experiments (covering 7 existing IRM variants and 7
datasets) to justify the practical significance of revisiting IRM training and
evaluation in a principled manner.

video segments for each modality. It often performs in a weakly supervised
manner, where only video event labels are provided, i.e., the modalities and
the timestamps of the labels are unknown. Due to the lack of densely annotated
labels, recent work attempts to leverage pseudo labels to enrich the
supervision. A commonly used strategy is to generate pseudo labels by
categorizing the known event labels for each modality. However, the labels are
still limited to the video level, and the temporal boundaries of event
timestamps remain unlabeled. In this paper, we propose a new pseudo label
generation strategy that can explicitly assign labels to each video segment by
utilizing prior knowledge learned from the open world. Specifically, we exploit
the CLIP model to estimate the events in each video segment based on visual
modality to generate segment-level pseudo labels. A new loss function is
proposed to regularize these labels by taking into account their
category-richness and segmentrichness. A label denoising strategy is adopted to
improve the pseudo labels by flipping them whenever high forward binary cross
entropy loss occurs. We perform extensive experiments on the LLP dataset and
demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality segment-level pseudo
labels with the help of our newly proposed loss and the label denoising

first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and ab-initio molecular

energy -3.84 eV, and single Sc decorated on BPh can absorb a maximum of five
H$_2$ molecules resulting in a high gravimetric weight percentage of 11.07,
which is significantly higher than DoE's ultimate criteria (6.5 wt%). Using
van't Hoff equation, strongly and weakly attached hydrogens correspond to
desorption temperatures of 200 K and 397 K with an average of 305 K. The high
binding of Sc to BPh is due to charge donation of 3d orbital of Sc to 2p
orbital of C. The interactions between absorbed H$_2$ and BPh+Sc are due to
charge transfer from 3d-orbital of Sc to ${\sigma}$* bond of H$_2$ molecules
and backdonation from ${\sigma}$ bond of H$_2$ to empty 3d-orbital of Sc known
as Kubas type interaction. Furthermore, phonon and AIMD simulation confirm
BPh+Sc stability, and the presence of an energy barrier shows no probability of
Sc-Sc clustering on BPh. So theoretically stable BPh+Sc showing high
gravimetric weight percentage with an average 305 K desorption temperature,
might be a potential candidate for solidstage hydrogen devices.

  https://github.com/yang-jin-hai/SAIN",,,,"cs.CV cs.MM eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  High-resolution (HR) images are usually downscaled to low-resolution (LR)
ones for better display and afterward upscaled back to the original size to
recover details. Recent work in image rescaling formulates downscaling and
upscaling as a unified task and learns a bijective mapping between HR and LR
via invertible networks. However, in real-world applications (e.g., social
media), most images are compressed for transmission. Lossy compression will
lead to irreversible information loss on LR images, hence damaging the inverse
upscaling procedure and degrading the reconstruction accuracy. In this paper,
we propose the Self-Asymmetric Invertible Network (SAIN) for compression-aware
image rescaling. To tackle the distribution shift, we first develop an
end-to-end asymmetric framework with two separate bijective mappings for
high-quality and compressed LR images, respectively. Then, based on empirical
analysis of this framework, we model the distribution of the lost information
(including downscaling and compression) using isotropic Gaussian mixtures and
propose the Enhanced Invertible Block to derive high-quality/compressed LR
images in one forward pass. Besides, we design a set of losses to regularize
the learned LR images and enhance the invertibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the consistent improvements of SAIN across various image rescaling
datasets in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluation under
standard image compression formats (i.e., JPEG and WebP).

reproduces not only the linear Regge spectrum, but also, via the holographic
Wilson confinement criterion, the ''linear plus Coulomb'' confinement potential
similar to the Cornell potential. This property could be interpreted as a
holographic counterpart of the hadron string picture, where the linearly rising
potential and Regge-like spectrum are directly related. However, such a
relation does not take place in the bottom-up holographic approach. Namely, the
Cornell-like potentials arise in a broad class of bottom-up holographic models,
the standard Soft-Wall model is merely a particular representative of this
class. We consider a calculation of confinement potential within a different
representative of this class - a Soft-Wall model with linear dilaton background
in the metric. This model leads to a Hydrogen like spectrum. The calculation of
renormalized potential at short distances turns out to be complicated by a new
subtlety that was skipped in general discussions of the issue existing in the
literature. But the confinement potential of the model is shown to be not very
different from the potential obtained in the standard Soft-Wall model with

Fermilab, the rapid progress of the LHC search for supersymmetry, and the

Model (MSSM). We conclude that higgsino mass should be larger than about
$500~{\rm GeV}$ for $M_1 < 0 $ and $630~{\rm GeV}$ for $M_1 > 100~{\rm GeV}$,
where $M_1$ denotes the bino mass. These improved bounds imply a tuning of
${\cal{O}}(1\%)$ to predict the $Z$-boson mass and simultaneously worsen the
naturalness of the $Z$- and $h$-mediated resonant annihilations to achieve the
measured dark matter density. We also concluded that the LHC restrictions have
set lower bounds on the sparticle mass spectra: $ m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^0} \gtrsim
210~{\rm GeV}$, $m_{\tilde{\chi}_2^0}, m_{\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm} \gtrsim 235~{\rm

$\tilde{\chi}_{2}^0$ and $\tilde{\chi}_1^\pm$ are wino-dominated when they are
lighter than about $500~{\rm GeV}$. These bounds are far beyond the reach of
the LEP experiments in searching for supersymmetry and have not been acquired
before. In addition, we illuminate how some parameter spaces of the MSSM have
been tested at the LHC and provide five scenarios in which the theory coincides
with the LHC restrictions. Once the muon g-2 anomaly is confirmed to originate

can be succinctly described as follows: a set of rank-ordered applicants are
interviewed sequentially for a single position. Once an applicant is
interviewed, an immediate and irrevocable decision is made if the person is to
be offered the job or not and only applicants observed so far can be used in
the decision process. The problem of interest is to identify the stopping rule
that maximizes the probability of hiring the highest-ranked applicant. A
multiple-choice version of the Secretary problem, known as the Dowry problem,
assumes that one is given a fixed integer budget for the total number of
selections allowed to choose the best applicant. It has been solved using tools
from dynamic programming and optimal stopping theory. We provide the first
combinatorial proof for a related new \emph{query-based model} for which we are
allowed to solicit the response of an expert to determine if an applicant is
optimal. Since the selection criteria differ from those of the Dowry problem we
obtain nonidentical expected stopping times.
  Our result indicates that an optimal strategy is the $(a_s, a_{s-1}, \ldots,
a_1)$-strategy, i.e., for the $i^{th}$ selection, where $1 \le i \le s$ and $1
\le j = s+1-i \le s$, we reject the first $a_j$ applicants, wait until the
decision of the $(i-1)^{th}$ selection (if $i \ge 2$), and then accept the next
applicant whose qualification is better than all previously appeared
applicants. Furthermore, our optimal strategy is right-hand based, i.e., the
optimal strategies for two models with $s_1$ and $s_2$ selections in total
($s_1 < s_2$) share the same sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{s_1}$ when it is
viewed from the right. When the total number of applicants tends to infinity,
our result agrees with the thresholds obtained by Gilbert and Mosteller.

stochastic amplitudes that propagate both forward and backward in the time
direction. The dynamics is derived from quantum mechanics: The instantaneous
joint density of amplitudes $x$ and $p$ is proved equivalent to the positive
$Q(x,p,t)$ phase-space distribution, which establishes causal consistency. We
model the measurement $\hat{x}$ as amplification, confirming Born's rule for a
system prepared in a superposition of eigenstates $|x_{j}\rangle$ of $\hat{x}$.
The trajectories for the backward-propagating variable $x$ are governed by a
future boundary condition determined by the measurement setting, as though the
system were prepared in a mixture of $|x_{j}\rangle$. Causal relations are
deduced from the simulations. For superpositions and entangled states, we
identify causal loops for variables that are not observable. A hybrid causal
structure exists that is consistent with macroscopic realism. Further, the
model allows forward-backward simulation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and Bell
correlations, which addresses a question raised by Schr\""odinger. The
simulations reveal consistency with a weak form of local realism defined for
the system after the unitary interactions determining the measurement settings,
the Bell violations emerging due to a breakdown of a subset of Bell's
local-realism conditions. Our results elucidate how hidden causal loops can
explain Bell nonlocality, without requiring retrocausality at a macroscopic

the pandemic (e.g., for fear of missing work or other obligations due to

therefore help augment current approaches to surveilling pandemics. This study
evaluated the effectiveness of using social media data as a data source for
tracking public health pandemics. There have been several attempts at using
social media data from platforms like Twitter for analyzing the COVID-19
pandemic. While these provide a multitude of useful insights, new platforms
like Venmo, a popular U.S. mobile social payment app often used during
in-person activities, remain understudied. We developed unique computational
methods (combining Venmo- and Facebook- derived data) to classify post content,
including the location where the content was likely posted. This approach
enabled geotemporal COVID-19-related infoveillance. By examining 135M publicly
available Venmo transactions from 22.1M unique users, we found significant
spikes in the use of COVID-19 related keywords in March 2020. Using
Facebook-based geotags for 9K users along with transaction geo-parsing (i.e.,
parsing text to detect place names), we identified 38K location-based clusters.
Within these groups, we found a strong correlation (0.81) between the use of
COVID-19 keywords in a region and the number of reported COVID-19 cases as well
as an aggregate decrease in transactions during lockdowns and an increase when
lockdowns are lifted. Surprisingly, we saw a weak negative correlation between
the number of transactions and reported cases over time (-0.49). Our results
indicate that using non-Twitter social media trace data can aid pandemic- and

therefore are possibly correlated with external systems, which the agent does
not have access to. Do such correlations help or hinder catalysis, and does the
classicality or quantumness of such correlations matter? To answer this
question, we first focus on the existence of a non-invasively measurable
observable that yields the same outcomes for repeated measurements, since this
signifies macro-realism, a key property distinguishing classical systems from
quantum systems. We show that a system quantumly correlated with an external
system so that the joint state is necessarily perturbed by any repeatable
quantum measurement, also has the same property against general quantum
channels. Our full characterization of such systems called totally quantum
systems, solves the open problem of characterizing tomographically sensitive
systems raised in [Lie and Jeong, Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 020802 (2023)]. An
immediate consequence is that a totally quantum system cannot catalyze any
quantum process, even when a measure of correlation with its environment is
arbitrarily low. It generalizes to a stronger result, that the mutual
information of totally quantum systems cannot be used as a catalyst either.
These results culminate in the conclusion that, out of the correlations that a
generic quantum catalyst has with its environment, only classical correlations
allow for catalysis, and therefore using a correlated catalyst is equivalent to
using an ensemble of uncorrelated catalysts.

energy confinement scaling with collisionality, $\tau_E\propto\,\nu_*^{-1}$. On
the considered surfaces microtearing modes dominate linearly at binormal length
scales of the order of the ion Larmor radius. While the effect of electron
collision frequency is moderate in linear simulations, a strong dependence on

$a$ are the surface and tokamak minor radius, respectively. The dynamics of
magnetic islands generated by microtearing modes is analysed, showing that the
radial extent of the stochastic region caused by islands overlapping plays an
important role in determining the saturation level of the microtearing mode
driven heat flux. Local nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations show that the
microtearing mode driven heat flux, $Q_e^\mathrm{MTM}$, is largely dominated by
magnetic flutter and depends strongly on the magnetic shear, $\hat{s}$.
Comparing two surfaces, $r/a=0.5$ and $r/a=0.6$, reveals that

explain how the specification of realistic topological quantum gates, operating

increases communication cost, runtime and privacy concerns. In this study, a
novel hierarchical training method for deep neural networks is proposed that
uses early exits in a divided architecture between edge and cloud workers to
reduce the communication cost, training runtime and privacy concerns. The
method proposes a brand-new use case for early exits to separate the backward
pass of neural networks between the edge and the cloud during the training
phase. We address the issues of most available methods that due to the
sequential nature of the training phase, cannot train the levels of hierarchy
simultaneously or they do it with the cost of compromising privacy. In
contrast, our method can use both edge and cloud workers simultaneously, does
not share the raw input data with the cloud and does not require communication

different neural network architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of this
method. It is shown that the proposed method reduces the training runtime by
29% and 61% in CIFAR-10 classification experiment for VGG-16 and ResNet-18 when
the communication with the cloud is done at a low bit rate channel. This gain
in the runtime is achieved whilst the accuracy drop is negligible. This method
is advantageous for online learning of high-accuracy deep neural networks on

Specifically, we construct the first UGC AVQA database named the SJTU-UAV
database, which includes 520 in-the-wild UGC audio and video (A/V) sequences,
and conduct a user study to obtain the mean opinion scores of the A/V
sequences. The content of the SJTU-UAV database is then analyzed from both the
audio and video aspects to show the database characteristics. We also design a
family of AVQA models, which fuse the popular VQA methods and audio features
via support vector regressor (SVR). We validate the effectiveness of the
proposed models on the three databases. The experimental results show that with
the help of audio signals, the VQA models can evaluate the perceptual quality
more accurately. The database will be released to facilitate further research.

different domains, such as genome classification in health and anomaly
detection in business. However, the lack of explicit features in sequence data
makes it difficult for machine learning models. While Neural Network (NN)
models address this with learning features automatically, they are limited to
capturing adjacent structural connections and ignore global, higher-order
information between the sequences. To address these challenges in the sequence
classification problems, we propose a novel Hypergraph Attention Network model,
namely Seq-HyGAN. To capture the complex structural similarity between sequence
data, we first create a hypergraph where the sequences are depicted as
hyperedges and subsequences extracted from sequences are depicted as nodes.
Additionally, we introduce an attention-based Hypergraph Neural Network model
that utilizes a two-level attention mechanism. This model generates a sequence
representation as a hyperedge while simultaneously learning the crucial
subsequences for each sequence. We conduct extensive experiments on four data
sets to assess and compare our model with several state-of-the-art methods.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Seq-HyGAN model can
effectively classify sequence data and significantly outperform the baselines.
We also conduct case studies to investigate the contribution of each module in

anomalous diffusion, with a temperature-dependent anomalous exponent
$\alpha<1$. We analyze our findings in the light of two standard models in

global quantum quench unveils important insights about the competition between
interactions and disorder, yielding in particular an insightful perspective on
many body localization (MBL). Still, the experimentally relevant effect of bond
randomness in long-range interacting spin chains on the quantum quench dynamics
have so far not been investigated. In this letter, we examine the entanglement
entropy growth after a global quench in a quantum spin chain with randomly
placed spins and long-range tunable interactions decaying with distance with
power $\alpha$. Using a dynamical version of the strong disorder
renormalization group (SDRG) we find for $\alpha >\alpha_c$ that the
entanglement entropy grows logarithmically with time and becomes smaller with
larger $\alpha$ as $S(t) = S_p \ln(t)/(2\alpha)$. Here, $S_p= 2 \ln2 -1$. We
use numerical exact diagonalization (ED) simulations to verify our results for
system sizes up to $ N\sim 16$ spins, yielding good agreement for sufficiently
large $\alpha > \alpha_c \approx 1.8$. For $\alpha<\alpha_c$, we find that the
entanglement entropy grows as a power-law with time, $S(t)\sim
t^{\gamma(\alpha)}$ with $0<\gamma(\alpha)<1$ a decaying function of the

of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) and BEiT. However, subsequent works have
complicated the framework with new auxiliary tasks or extra pre-trained models,
inevitably increasing computational overhead. This paper undertakes a
fundamental analysis of MIM from the perspective of pixel reconstruction, which
examines the input image patches and reconstruction target, and highlights two
critical but previously overlooked bottlenecks. Based on this analysis, we
propose a remarkably simple and effective method, {\ourmethod}, that entails
two strategies: 1) filtering the high-frequency components from the
reconstruction target to de-emphasize the network's focus on texture-rich
details and 2) adopting a conservative data transform strategy to alleviate the
problem of missing foreground in MIM training. {\ourmethod} can be easily
integrated into most existing pixel-based MIM approaches (\ie, using raw images
as reconstruction target) with negligible additional computation. Without bells
and whistles, our method consistently improves three MIM approaches, MAE,
ConvMAE, and LSMAE, across various downstream tasks. We believe this effective
plug-and-play method will serve as a strong baseline for self-supervised
learning and provide insights for future improvements of the MIM framework.

of the paring strength in certain parameter regimes. In experiments, however,
it is observed that the oscillation decays rapidly when the interaction becomes
strong, such as in the unitary fermi gas. A theoretical analysis is still
absent. In this work, we construct an SYK-like model to analyze the effect of
strong interactions in one dimensional BCS system. We utilize the large-$N$
approximation and Green's function-based technique to solve the equilibrium
problem and quench dynamics. We find that a strong SYK interaction suppresses
the paring order. We further verify that the system quickly thermalizes with
SYK interactions for both intrinsic pairing order or proximity effect, which
leads to a rapid decay of the strength of the oscillations. The decay rates
exhibit different scaling laws against SYK interaction, which can be understood
in terms of the Boltzmann equation. Our work makes a first step towards the

1) with the increase of the traffic intensity, the absolute error of the

been developed, extracting the universal dynamics of generic many-body quantum
systems remains a big challenge. The multi-channel Kondo impurity (MCKI) model,
one of the exotic phases of matter that hosts an over-screened Kondo state with
non-Fermi liquid properties, provides a platform for theoretically studying the
universal properties of quantum dynamics in many-body systems. By using the
large-N Schwinger-Keldysh approach, we systematically investigate transient
dynamics and long-time thermalization properties in MCKI under a sudden change
of the Kondo coupling. We observe general oscillation patterns with a universal
frequency in physical quantities for the initial state being over-screened
Kondo state under the sudden quench while the no oscillations for the initial
state being a high-temepreature Fermi liquid state due to the de-phasing.
Additionally, we find that the equilibration of the system heavily depends on
the initial state and the quench protocol. On top of the numerical analysis, we
also provide a phenomenological analysis for the equilibration using the
quantum Boltzmann equation. Our approach sheds light on the universal

in the core region around each nucleus and approach a universal two-body
correlation factor for valence electrons. The Transcorrelated Hamiltonian is
used to optimize the orbitals of a single Slater determinant within a
biorthonormal framework. The Slater-Jastrow wave function is optimized on a set
of atomic and molecular systems containing both second-row elements and $3d$
transition metal elements. The optimization of the correlation factor and the
orbitals, along with increasing the basis set, results in a systematic lowering
of the Variational Monte Carlo energy for all systems tested. Importantly, the
optimal parameters of the correlation factor obtained for atomic systems are
transferable to molecules. Additionally, the present correlation factor is
computationally efficient, using a mixed analytical-numerical integration
scheme that reduces the costly numerical integration from $\mathbb{R}^6$ to
$\mathbb{R}^3$.

learning, letting machines work on tasks without curated training data. As a
good start and the only existing outcome of zero-shot image captioning (IC),
ZeroCap abandons supervised training and sequentially searches every word in
the caption using the knowledge of large-scale pretrained models. Though
effective, its autoregressive generation and gradient-directed searching
mechanism limit the diversity of captions and inference speed, respectively.
Moreover, ZeroCap does not consider the controllability issue of zero-shot IC.
To move forward, we propose a framework for Controllable Zero-shot IC, named
ConZIC. The core of ConZIC is a novel sampling-based non-autoregressive
language model named GibbsBERT, which can generate and continuously polish
every word. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed ConZIC for both zero-shot IC and
controllable zero-shot IC. Especially, ConZIC achieves about 5x faster
generation speed than ZeroCap, and about 1.5x higher diversity scores, with
accurate generation given different control signals.

difficult. We propose a model for simultaneous dimensionality reduction and
clustering by assuming a mixture model for a set of latent scores, which are
then linked to the observations via a Gaussian latent factor model. This
approach was recently investigated by Chandra et al. (2020). The authors use a
factor-analytic representation and assume a mixture model for the latent
factors. However, performance can deteriorate in the presence of model
misspecification. Assuming a repulsive point process prior for the
component-specific means of the mixture for the latent scores is shown to yield
a more robust model that outperforms the standard mixture model for the latent
factors in several simulated scenarios. To favor well-separated clusters of
data, the repulsive point process must be anisotropic, and its density should
be tractable for efficient posterior inference. We address these issues by
proposing a general construction for anisotropic determinantal point processes.

attention-based neural network trained with reinforcement learning, which is
shared across all sub-problems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms classic meta-heuristics, construction

that our neural method generalizes well to instances with large numbers of

  Conf-Ensemble is an adaptation to Boosting to create ensembles based on model

key idea is to create successive model experts for samples that were difficult
(not necessarily incorrectly classified) by the preceding model. This technique
has been shown to provide better results than boosting in binary-classification
with a small feature space (~80 features).
  In this paper, we evaluate the Conf-Ensemble approach in the much more
complex task of image classification with the ImageNet dataset (224x224x3
features with 1000 classes). Image classification is an important benchmark for
AI-based perception and thus it helps to assess if this method can be used in
safety-critical applications using ML ensembles.
  Our experiments indicate that in a complex multi-label classification task,
the expected benefit of specialization on complex input samples cannot be
achieved with a small sample set, i.e., a good classifier seems to rely on very
complex feature analysis that cannot be well trained on just a limited subset
of ""difficult samples"".
  We propose an improvement to Conf-Ensemble to increase the number of samples
fed to successive ensemble members, and a three-member Conf-Ensemble using this
improvement was able to surpass a single model in accuracy, although the amount

ramp metering for freeways and perimeter control for homogeneous urban roads,
and we aim to develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based coordinated
control framework for large-scale networks. The main challenges are 1) there is
a lack of efficient dynamic models for both freeways and urban roads; 2) the
standard DRL method becomes ineffective due to the complex and non-stationary
network dynamics. In view of this, we propose a novel meso-macro dynamic
network model and first time develop a demonstration-guided DRL method to
achieve large-scale coordinated ramp metering and perimeter control. The
dynamic network model hybridizes the link and generalized bathtub models to
depict the traffic dynamics of freeways and urban roads, respectively. For the
DRL method, we incorporate demonstration to guide the DRL method for better
convergence by introducing the concept of ""teacher"" and ""student"" models. The
teacher models are traditional controllers (e.g., ALINEA, Gating), which
provide control demonstrations. The student models are DRL methods, which learn
from the teacher and aim to surpass the teacher's performance. To validate the
proposed framework, we conduct two case studies in a small-scale network and a

between thyroid and chronic respiratory diseases (p-value 0.018). We also found
an association between DM and CKD among patients over 65 (p-value 0.038).
Moreover, there has been a statistically significant relationship between CKD
and Thyroid (P < 0.05) for those below 35 and 35-65. We used a two-way ANOVA
test to find the statistically significant interaction of heart issues and
chronic respiratory illness, in combination with diabetes. The combination of
DM and RTI also affected CKD in male patients over 65 years old.

reasoning tasks and often provide incorrect answers. Unlike natural language
understanding, math problems typically have a single correct answer, making the
task of generating accurate solutions more challenging for LLMs. To the best of
our knowledge, we are not aware of any LLMs that indicate their level of
confidence in their responses which fuels a trust deficit in these models
impeding their adoption. To address this deficiency, we propose `MathPrompter',
a technique that improves performance of LLMs on arithmetic problems along with
increased reliance in the predictions. MathPrompter uses the Zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting technique to generate multiple Algebraic expressions
or Python functions to solve the same math problem in different ways and
thereby raise the confidence level in the output results. This is in contrast
to other prompt based CoT methods, where there is no check on the validity of
the intermediate steps followed. Our technique improves over state-of-the-art
on the MultiArith dataset ($78.7\%\rightarrow92.5\%$) evaluated using 175B

(HAR) that are trained from controlled, well-curated datasets suffer from poor
generalizability in practical deployments. However, data collected from
naturalistic settings often contains significant label noise. In this work, we
examine two in-the-wild HAR datasets and DivideMix, a state-of-the-art learning
with noise labels (LNL) method to understand the extent and impacts of noisy
labels in training data. Our empirical analysis reveals that the substantial
domain gaps among diverse subjects cause LNL methods to violate a key
underlying assumption, namely, neural networks tend to fit simpler (and thus
clean) data in early training epochs. Motivated by the insights, we design
VALERIAN, an invariant feature learning method for in-the-wild wearable
sensor-based HAR. By training a multi-task model with separate task-specific
layers for each subject, VALERIAN allows noisy labels to be dealt with
individually while benefiting from shared feature representation across
subjects. We evaluated VALERIAN on four datasets, two collected in a controlled
environment and two in the wild.

use a detection function to estimate megafauna populations which are not
explicitly seen. A goal of the research is to maximize useful imagery
collected, to that end we will use our glare model to predict glare and
optimize for glare-free data collection. To build this model, we leverage a
small labelled dataset to perform semi-supervised learning. The large dataset
is labelled with a Cascading Random Forest Model using a na\""ive
pseudo-labelling approach. A reflectance model is used, which pinpoints
features of interest, to populate our datasets which allows for context-aware
machine learning models. The pseudo-labelled dataset is used on two models: a
Multilayer Perceptron and a Recurrent Neural Network. With this paper, we lay
the foundation for data-driven mission planning; a glare modelling system which
allows surveyors to preemptively minimize glare and reduces survey reliance on
the detection function as an estimator of whale populations during periods of
poor subsurface visibility.

problem for creating believable motions that can drive a humanoid robot to
interact and communicate with human users. Such capability will improve the
impressions of the robots by human users and will find applications in
education, training, and medical services. One challenge in learning the
co-speech gesture model is that there may be multiple viable gesture motions
for the same speech utterance. The deterministic regression methods can not
resolve the conflicting samples and may produce over-smoothed or damped
motions. We proposed a two-stage model to address this uncertainty issue in
gesture synthesis by modeling the gesture segments as discrete latent codes.
Our method utilizes RQ-VAE in the first stage to learn a discrete codebook
consisting of gesture tokens from training data. In the second stage, a
two-level autoregressive transformer model is used to learn the prior
distribution of residual codes conditioned on input speech context. Since the
inference is formulated as token sampling, multiple gesture sequences could be
generated given the same speech input using top-k sampling. The quantitative
results and the user study showed the proposed method outperforms the previous
methods and is able to generate realistic and diverse gesture motions.

will still discover ways to disrupt 5G unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations
and decrease UAV control communication performance in Air-to-Ground (A2G)
links. Operating under the assumption that the 5G UAV communications
infrastructure will never be entirely secure, we propose Deep Attention
Recognition (DAtR) as a solution to identify attacks based on a small deep
network embedded in authenticated UAVs. Our proposed solution uses two
observable parameters: the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) and
the Reference Signal Received Power (RSSI) to recognize attacks under
Line-of-Sight (LoS), Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS), and a probabilistic combination
of the two conditions. In the tested scenarios, a number of attackers are
located in random positions, while their power is varied in each simulation.
Moreover, terrestrial users are included in the network to impose additional
complexity on attack detection. To improve the systems overall performance in
the attack scenarios, we propose complementing the deep network decision with
two mechanisms based on data manipulation and majority voting techniques. We
compare several performance parameters in our proposed Deep Network. For
example, the impact of Long Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) and Attention layers in
terms of their overall accuracy, the window size effect, and test the accuracy
when only partial data is available in the training process. Finally, we
benchmark our deep network with six widely used classifiers regarding
classification accuracy. Our algorithms accuracy exceeds 4% compared with the
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) classifier in LoS condition and around 3% in
the short distance NLoS condition. Considering the proposed deep network, all
other classifiers present lower accuracy than XGB.

governed by wave kinetic equations. To simplify the analysis, one frequently
works with reduced differential models of the wave kinetics. However, the
conditions for deriving such reduced models are seldom justified
self-consistently. Here, we derive a reduced model for the wave kinetics of the
Schr{\""o}dinger-Helmholtz equations in two spatial dimensions, which constitute
a model for the dynamics of light in a spatially-nonlocal, nonlinear optical
medium. This model has the property of sharply localising the frequencies of
the interacting waves into two pairs, allowing for a rigorous and
self-consistent derivation of what we term the semilocal approximation model
(SLAM) of the wave kinetic equation. Using the SLAM, we study the stationary
spectra of Schr{\""o}dinger-Helmholtz wave turbulence, and characterise the
spectra that carry energy downscale, and waveaction upscale, in a
forced-dissipated setup. The latter involves a nonlocal transfer of waveaction,
in which waves at the forcing scale mediate the interactions of waves at every
larger scale. This is in contrast to the energy cascade, which involves local
scale-by-scale interactions, familiar from other wave turbulent systems and
from classical hydrodynamical turbulence.

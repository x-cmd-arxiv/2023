for the formation of the first galaxies. Accurate chemical abundances of ultra
metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<-4) can be used to infer properties of the first
stars, and thus the formation mechanism for low-mass second generation stars in
the early universe. Spectroscopic studies have shown that most second
generation stars are carbon-enhanced with one notable exception SDSS
J102915.14+172927.9. Aims: We reanalyse the composition of SDSS
J102915.14+172927.9. Methods: We developed a tailored 3D model atmosphere for
SDSS J102915.14+172927.9 with the Stagger-code, making use of an improved
surface gravity estimate based on the Gaia DR3 parallax. This model was used as
input in the radiative transfer code Balder to compute 3D non-LTE synthetic
spectra. These spectra were then used to infer abundances for Mg, Si, Ca, Fe
and Ni, and upper limits on Li, Na and Al. 3D LTE synthetic spectra were
computed with Scate to infer the abundance of Ti and upper limits on C and N.
Results: In contrast to earlier works based on 1D non-LTE corrections to 3D LTE
results, we are able to achieve ionisation balance for Ca I and Ca II when
employing our consistent 3D non-LTE treatment. Moreover, the elemental
abundances are systematically higher than those found in earlier works. In
particular, [Fe/H] increases by 0.57 dex, and the upper limits of C and N
increase by 0.90 dex and 1.82 dex, respectively. Conclusions: We find that
Population III progenitors with masses 10-20 M_sun exploding with energy
E<=3*10^{51} erg can reproduce our 3D non-LTE abundance pattern. Contrary to
previous work, we obtain higher upper limits on the carbon abundance that are
``marginally consistent'' with star formation through atomic line cooling, and
as such, prevent strong conclusions about the formation mechanism of this low
mass star.

However, when applied to high magnification datasets, problems emerge due to

of multi-agent systems, intelligent control theory, cooperative object
manipulation, discrete abstraction design of multi-agent-object systems, and
formal verification. The first part of the thesis is devoted to the design of
continuous control protocols for cooperative object manipulation/transportation
by multiple robotic agents, and the relation of rigid cooperative manipulation
schemes to multi-agent formation. In the second part of the thesis, we develop
control schemes for the continuous coordination of multi-agent complex systems
with uncertain dynamics, focusing on multi-agent navigation with collision

critical yet challenging problem. In this paper, we study cooperative data
collection using multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with the objective of
minimizing the total average Age of Information (AoI). We consider various
constraints of the UAVs, including kinematic, energy, trajectory, and collision
avoidance, in order to optimize the data collection process. Specifically, each
UAV, which has limited on-board energy, takes off from its initial location and
flies over sensor nodes to collect update packets in cooperation with the other
UAVs. The UAVs must land at their final destinations with non-negative residual
energy after the specified time duration to ensure they have enough energy to
complete their missions. It is crucial to design the trajectories of the UAVs
and the transmission scheduling of the sensor nodes to enhance information
freshness. We model the multi-UAV data collection problem as a Decentralized
Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP), as each UAV is
unaware of the dynamics of the environment and can only observe a part of the
sensors. To address the challenges of this problem, we propose a multi-agent
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based algorithm with centralized learning and
decentralized execution. In addition to the reward shaping, we use action masks
to filter out invalid actions and ensure that the constraints are met.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly
reduce the total average AoI compared to the baseline algorithms, and the use
of the action mask method can improve the convergence speed of the proposed
algorithm.

nonuniformly emitting hydrogen atmosphere. However, the latter scenario appears
unlikely given the available upper limits on the amplitude of pulsations. Here

study how the policy networks of typical DRL agents evolve during the learning
process by empirically investigating several kinds of temporal change for each
policy parameter. On typical MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite (DMC)
benchmarks, we find common phenomena for TD3 and RAD agents: 1) the activity of
policy network parameters is highly asymmetric and policy networks advance
monotonically along very few major parameter directions; 2) severe detours
occur in parameter update and harmonic-like changes are observed for all minor
parameter directions. By performing a novel temporal SVD along policy learning
path, the major and minor parameter directions are identified as the columns of
right unitary matrix associated with dominant and insignificant singular values
respectively. Driven by the discoveries above, we propose a simple and
effective method, called Policy Path Trimming and Boosting (PPTB), as a general

trim the policy learning path by canceling the policy updates in minor

of the absence of the supply side (drivers). However, it has far-reaching
consequences because in addition to pricing, players now have to make decisions
on how to distribute fleets across network locations and re-balance vehicles in
order to serve future demand. In this paper, we explore a duopoly setting in
the ride-sharing marketplace where the players have fully autonomous fleets.
Each ride-service provider (RSP)'s prices depend on the prices and the supply
of the other player. We formulate their decision-making problems using a
game-theoretic setup where each player seeks to find the optimal prices and
supplies at each node while considering the decisions of the other player. This
leads to a scenario where the players' optimization problems are coupled and it
is challenging to find the equilibrium. We characterize the types of demand
functions (e.g.: linear) for which this game admits an exact potential function
and can be solved efficiently. For other types of demand functions, we propose
an iterative algorithm to compute the equilibrium. We conclude by providing
numerical insights into how different kinds of equilibria would play out in the
market when the players are asymmetric. Our numerical evaluations also provide

navigate in unseen environments only through language and vision supervision.
In the recently proposed continuous settings (continuous VLN), the agent must
act in a free 3D space and faces tougher challenges like real-time execution,
complex instruction understanding, and long action sequence prediction. For a
better performance in continuous VLN, we design a multi-level instruction
understanding procedure and propose a novel model, Multi-Level Attention
Network (MLANet). The first step of MLANet is to generate sub-instructions
efficiently. We design a Fast Sub-instruction Algorithm (FSA) to segment the
raw instruction into sub-instructions and generate a new sub-instruction
dataset named ``FSASub"". FSA is annotation-free and faster than the current
method by 70 times, thus fitting the real-time requirement in continuous VLN.
To solve the complex instruction understanding problem, MLANet needs a global
perception of the instruction and observations. We propose a Multi-Level
Attention (MLA) module to fuse vision, low-level semantics, and high-level
semantics, which produce features containing a dynamic and global comprehension
of the task. MLA also mitigates the adverse effects of noise words, thus
ensuring a robust understanding of the instruction. To correctly predict
actions in long trajectories, MLANet needs to focus on what sub-instruction is
being executed every step. We propose a Peak Attention Loss (PAL) to improve
the flexible and adaptive selection of the current sub-instruction. PAL
benefits the navigation agent by concentrating its attention on the local
information, thus helping the agent predict the most appropriate actions. We
train and test MLANet in the standard benchmark. Experiment results show MLANet
outperforms baselines by a significant margin.

performing well during task execution. Having a wide range of Z-width, which
shows the region of passively renderable impedance by a haptic display, is also
important to render a wide range of virtual environments. To address these
issues, in this study, subsystem-based adaptive impedance control is designed
for having a stable human-robot-environment interaction of 7 degrees of freedom
haptic exoskeleton. The presented control decomposes the entire system into
subsystems and designs the controller at the subsystem level. The stability of
the controller in the presence of contact with the virtual environment and
human arm force is proved by employing the virtual stability concept.
Additionally, the Z-width of the 7-DoF haptic exoskeleton is drawn using

the process, we find that in the leading order, the initial eccentricity $e_0$
and the dimensionless tidal deformability $\Lambda$ couple as $\sim
e_0^n\Lambda$, where $n$ is a positive number. We only focus on the dominant
contribution, i.e., $e_0^2\Lambda$. We also compute the accumulated dephasing
for binary neutron star systems. We find that for optimistic values of
eccentricities $e_0 \sim .05$ and $\Lambda \sim 600$, the accumulated dephasing
is $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ radian, requiring a signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 7000$

star systems with large eccentricities if the signal-to-noise ratios of the
systems are also very large. Hence, in third-generation detectors, it may have
an observable impact if the systems have large eccentricities. We also explore
the impact of this effect on extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). We find that
even for supermassive bodies with small values of $\Lambda \sim 10^{-3}$, this

successfully used laser photoionization of noble gas atoms in combination with

solutions within $(1\pm \epsilon)$-approximate factor--is an important research
direction in the study of center-based $k$-clustering problems, such as
$k$-means or $k$-median. Feldman and Langberg [STOC'11] have shown that for
$k$-clustering of $n$ points in general metrics, it is possible to obtain
coresets whose size depends logarithmically in $n$. Moreover, such a dependency
in $n$ is inevitable in general metrics. A significant amount of recent work in
the area is devoted to obtaining coresests whose sizes are independent of $n$
(i.e., ``small'' coresets) for special metrics, like $d$-dimensional Euclidean
spaces, doubling metrics, metrics of graphs of bounded treewidth, or those
excluding a fixed minor.
  In this paper, we provide the first constructions of small coresets for
$k$-clustering in the metrics induced by geometric intersection graphs, such as
Euclidean-weighted Unit Disk/Square Graphs. These constructions follow from a
general theorem that identifies two canonical properties of a graph metric
sufficient for obtaining small coresets. The proof of our theorem builds on the
recent work of Cohen-Addad, Saulpic, and Schwiegelshohn [STOC '21], which
ensures small-sized coresets conditioned on the existence of an interesting set
of centers, called ``centroid set''. The main technical contribution of our
work is the proof of the existence of such a small-sized centroid set for
graphs that satisfy the two canonical geometric properties. The new coreset
construction helps to design the first $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation for
center-based clustering problems in UDGs and USGs, that is fixed-parameter
tractable in $k$ and $\epsilon$ (FPT-AS).

predictions of high-dimensional non-linear functions of the observed data. The
remarkable flexibility of modern Machine Learning (ML) methods is perfectly
suited to this task. However, data-driven hyperparameter tuning of ML methods
requires effective model evaluation to avoid large errors in causal estimates,
a task made more challenging because causal inference involves unavailable
counterfactuals. Multiple performance-validation metrics have recently been
proposed such that practitioners now not only have to make complex decisions
about which causal estimators, ML learners and hyperparameters to choose, but
also about which evaluation metric to use. This paper, motivated by unclear
recommendations, investigates the interplay between the four different aspects
of model evaluation for causal effect estimation. We develop a comprehensive
experimental setup that involves many commonly used causal estimators, ML
methods and evaluation approaches and apply it to four well-known causal
inference benchmark datasets. Our results suggest that optimal hyperparameter
tuning of ML learners is enough to reach state-of-the-art performance in effect
estimation, regardless of estimators and learners. We conclude that most causal
estimators are roughly equivalent in performance if tuned thoroughly enough. We
also find hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation are much more important
than causal estimators and ML methods. Finally, from the significant gap we
find in estimation performance of popular evaluation metrics compared with
optimal model selection choices, we call for more research into causal model
evaluation to unlock the optimum performance not currently being delivered even

$m$ machines, in order to minimize the time it takes to process all jobs. Each
job is moldable, so it can be assigned not only to one but any number of the
equal machines. We assume that the work of each job is monotone and that jobs
can be placed non-contiguously. In this work we present a $(\frac 3 2 +
\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm with a worst-case runtime of ${O(n
\log^2(\frac 1 \epsilon + \frac {\log (\epsilon m)} \epsilon) +
\frac{n}{\epsilon} \log(\frac 1 \epsilon) {\log (\epsilon m)})}$ when $m\le

by a factor of $\frac 1 \epsilon$ and several logarithmic dependencies. We
complement this result with an improved FPTAS with running time $O(n
\log^2(\frac 1 \epsilon + \frac {\log (\epsilon m)} \epsilon))$ for instances
with many machines $m> 8\frac n \epsilon$. This yields a $\frac 3
2$-approximation with runtime $O(n \log^2(\log m))$ when $m>16n$.
  We achieve these results through one new core observation: In an
approximation setting one does not need to consider all $m$ possible allotments
for each job. We will show that we can reduce the number of relevant allotments
for each job from $m$ to $O(\frac 1 \epsilon + \frac {\log (\epsilon
m)}{\epsilon})$. Using this observation immediately yields the improved FPTAS.
For the other result we use a reduction to the knapsack problem first
introduced by Mouni\'e, Rapine and Trystram. We use the reduced number of
machines to give a new elaborate rounding scheme and define a modified version
of this this knapsack instance. This in turn allows for the application of a
convolution based algorithm by Axiotis and Tzamos. We further back our

to very challenging datasets, like ImageNet. Our model is based on three new
ideas. First, we incorporate an inaccurate off-the-shelf depth estimator into
3D GAN training via a special depth adaptation module to handle the
imprecision. Then, we create a flexible camera model and a regularization
strategy for it to learn its distribution parameters during training. Finally,
we extend the recent ideas of transferring knowledge from pre-trained
classifiers into GANs for patch-wise trained models by employing a simple
distillation-based technique on top of the discriminator. It achieves more
stable training than the existing methods and speeds up the convergence by at
least 40%. We explore our model on four datasets: SDIP Dogs 256x256, SDIP

were introduced to Motion Generation. Yet, the main gap in this field remains
the low availability of data. Furthermore, the expensive acquisition process of
motion biases the already modest data towards short single-person sequences.
With such a shortage, more elaborate generative tasks are left behind. In this
paper, we show that this gap can be mitigated using a pre-trained
diffusion-based model as a generative prior. We demonstrate the prior is
effective for fine-tuning, in a few-, and even a zero-shot manner. For the
zero-shot setting, we tackle the challenge of long sequence generation. We
introduce DoubleTake, an inference-time method with which we demonstrate up to
10-minute long animations of prompted intervals and their meaningful and
controlled transition, using the prior that was trained for 10-second
generations. For the few-shot setting, we consider two-person generation. Using
two fixed priors and as few as a dozen training examples, we learn a slim
communication block, ComMDM, to infuse interaction between the two resulting
motions. Finally, using fine-tuning, we train the prior to semantically
complete motions from a single prescribed joint. Then, we use our
DiffusionBlending to blend a few such models into a single one that responds
well to the combination of the individual control signals, enabling
fine-grained joint- and trajectory-level control and editing. Using an

learning from new text data by combining a parameterized neural LM with a
growable non-parametric memory for memorizing new content. However,
conventional semiparametric LMs will finally become prohibitive for computing
and storing if they are applied to continual learning over streaming data,
because the non-parametric memory grows linearly with the amount of data they
learn from over time. To address the issue of scalability, we present a simple
and intuitive approach called Selective Memorization (SeMem), which only
memorizes difficult samples that the model is likely to struggle with. We
demonstrate that SeMem improves the scalability of semiparametric LMs for
continual learning over streaming data in two ways: (1) data-wise scalability:
as the model becomes stronger through continual learning, it will encounter
fewer difficult cases that need to be memorized, causing the growth of the
non-parametric memory to slow down over time rather than growing at a linear
rate with the size of training data; (2) model-wise scalability: SeMem allows a
larger model to memorize fewer samples than its smaller counterpart because it
is rarer for a larger model to encounter incomprehensible cases, resulting in a
non-parametric memory that does not scale linearly with model size. We conduct
extensive experiments in language modeling and downstream tasks to test SeMem's
results, showing SeMem enables a semiparametric LM to be a scalable continual
learner with little forgetting.

  case study",,,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Understanding vascular adaptation, namely what drives veins to shrink or
grow, is key for the self-organization of flow networks and their optimization.
From the top-down principle of minimizing flow dissipation at a fixed metabolic
cost within flow networks, flow shear rate resulting from the flows pervading
veins is hypothesized to drive vein adaptation. Yet, there is no bottom-up
derivation of how flow forces impact vein dynamics. From the physical principle
of force balance, shear rate acts parallel to vein walls, and hence, naively
shear rate could only stretch veins and not dilate or shrink them. We, here,
resolve this paradox by theoretically investigating force balance on a vein
wall in the context of the vascular network of the model organism Physarum
polycephalum. We propose, based on previous mechanical studies of cross-linked
gels, that shear induces a nonlinear, anisotropic response of the actomyosin
gel, making up vein walls that can indeed drive vein dilatation. Furthermore,
our force balance approach allows us to identify that shear feedback occurs
with a typical timescale and with a typical target shear rate that are not
universal properties of the material but instead depend smoothly on the
location of the vein within the network. In particular, the target shear rate
is related to the vein's hydrostatic pressure, which highlights the role of
pressure in vascular adaptation. Finally, since our derivation is based on
force balance and fluid mechanics, we believe our approach can be extended to
vascular adaptation in other organisms.

alternative pairing: covalent bonding. We show that the covalent pairing is
favored at lower pressures, the superconducting cubic phase becomes unstable as
pressure is reduced. Previous calculations based on static relaxation neglect
three factors, all of which are important in stabilizing the cubic phase.
Finite temperature plays a role, and two quantum effects are also important -
the nuclear wavefunction contributes to destablizing the H$_2$ molecules, and
the zero-point pressure means that calculated pressures are significantly
overestimated by standard methods. We demonstrate these phenomena using
Born-Oppenheimer and path-integral molecular dynamics: these give the same
qualitative picture, with nuclear quantum effects (NQE) increasing the
transition pressure significantly. This competition between molecularization
and superconducting gap formation is the fundamental reason why hydride
superconductors have so far been found only at high pressure.

In this paper, we therefore propose a subgoal-driven hierarchical navigation
architecture that is trained with deep reinforcement learning and decouples
obstacle avoidance and motor control. In particular, we separate the navigation
task into the prediction of the next subgoal position for avoiding collisions
while moving toward the final target position, and the prediction of the
robot's velocity controls. By relying on 2D lidar, our method learns to avoid
obstacles while still achieving goal-directed behavior as well as to generate
low-level velocity control commands to reach the subgoals. In our architecture,
we apply the attention mechanism on the robot's 2D lidar readings and compute
the importance of lidar scan segments for avoiding collisions. As we show in
simulated and real-world experiments with a Turtlebot robot, our proposed
method leads to smooth and safe trajectories among humans and significantly
outperforms a state-of-the-art approach in terms of success rate. A

phenomenological philosophers have started to engage with QBism. In service of
the newfound discussion, the aim of this exposition is to lay out the structure
of QBism as clearly as possible for that audience. In the process, we arrive at
eight tenets for QBism: 1) A quantum state is an agent's personal judgment. 2)
A quantum measurement is an agent's action upon its external world. 3) Quantum
measurement outcomes are personal to the agent performing the action. 4) The
quantum formalism is normative rather than descriptive. 5) Unitary evolution
too expresses an agent's degrees of belief. 6) Even probability-one assignments
are judgments without ontic content. 7) Subjective certainty about what an
outcome will be does not negate that unperformed measurements have no outcomes.
And, 8) quantum theory is a single-user theory for each of us. We then analyze
the Wigner's friend thought experiment in light of the eight tenets and
indicate that a still more extended analysis is potentially QBism's surest path
to uncovering an ontology to go with quantum theory's normative structure. We
conclude with a small discussion of how the philosophy of Maurice Merleau-Ponty
may be relevant to this quest.

induce novel correlated complexes. Here we investigate the compound 4Hb-TaS$_2$
that interleaves the Mott-insulating state of 1T-TaS$_2$ and the putative spin
liquid it hosts together with the metallic state of 2H-TaS$_2$ and the low
temperature superconducting phase it harbors. We reveal a thermodynamic phase
diagram that hosts a first order quantum phase transition between a correlated
Kondo cluster state and a flat band state in which the Kondo cluster becomes
depleted. We demonstrate that this intrinsic transition can be induced by an
electric field and temperature as well as by manipulation of the interlayer
coupling with the probe tip, hence allowing to reversibly toggle between the
Kondo cluster and the flat band states. The phase transition is manifested by a
discontinuous change of the complete electronic spectrum accompanied by
hysteresis and low frequency noise. We find that the shape of the transition
line in the phase diagram is determined by the local compressibility and the
entropy of the two electronic states. Our findings set such heterogeneous
structures as an exciting platform for systematic investigation and
manipulation of Mott-metal transitions and strongly correlated phases and
quantum phase transitions therein.

perform (task formulation), who will perform them (task allocation), and when

NP-hard individually and become more challenging in combination. The difficulty
of the WSP is compounded by the scale of automated warehouses, which frequently
use teams of hundreds of agents. In this paper, we present a methodology that
can solve the WSP at such scales. We introduce a novel, contract-based design
framework which decomposes an automated warehouse into traffic system
components. By assigning each of these components a contract describing the
traffic flows it can support, we can synthesize a traffic flow satisfying a

algorithms are important steps towards reaching quantum advantage. This poses
heavy demands particularly on the control stack, as pulses need to be
distributed to an increasing number of control channels and variational
algorithms require rapid interleaving of quantum and classical computation.
Assessing the bottlenecks in the control stack is therefore key to making it
ready for reaching quantum advantage. However, existing benchmark suites suffer
from lack of detail due to indirect access to the control hardware. In this
work, we present Q-Profile, a tool to profile quantum control stacks that
circumvents these issues by utilizing a direct connection from the host CPU to
the control stack, providing fine accuracy in measuring the runtime and
allowing to identify performance bottlenecks. We demonstrate the use of our
tool by benchmarking the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) on a
Qblox Cluster for a virtual 4 to 14-qubit transmon system. Our results identify
the major execution bottlenecks in the passive qubit reset and communication
overhead. We estimate a 1.40x~speedup with respect to the total runtime by
using an active qubit reset, instead of passive reset, and demonstrate a
further speedup of 1.37x by parallel initialization of the control modules. The
presented method of profiling is applicable to other control-stack providers,
as well as to other benchmarks, while still providing detailed information
beyond a single metric. By extension, this tool will enable identifying and
eliminating bottlenecks for future quantum acceleration. The profiling tool is
included in the open-source Quantify quantum control software, which allows

quantum process in order to completely characterize the quantum operation for
an arbitrary input state. We show results for this method by characterizing a
logical quantum gate constructed using displacement and SNAP operations on an

(i.e. ""contact-based"" social navigation) in crowded environments are largely
unexplored even though collision-free social navigation is a well studied
problem. Traditional social navigation frameworks require the robot to stop
suddenly or ""freeze"" whenever a collision is imminent. This paradigm poses two
problems: 1) freezing while navigating a crowd may cause people to trip and
fall over the robot, resulting in more harm than the collision itself, and 2)
in very dense social environments where collisions are unavoidable, such a
control scheme would render the robot unable to move and preclude the
opportunity to study how humans incorporate robots into these environments.
However, if robots are to be meaningfully included in crowded social spaces,
such as busy streets, subways, stores, or other densely populated locales,
there may not exist trajectories that can guarantee zero collisions. Thus,
adoption of robots in these environments requires the development of minimally
disruptive navigation plans that can safely plan for and respond to contacts.
We propose a learning-based motion planner and control scheme to navigate dense
social environments using safe contacts for an omnidirectional mobile robot.
The planner is evaluated in simulation over 360 trials with crowd densities
varying between 0.0 and 1.6 people per square meter. Our navigation scheme is

$\beta$, consistent with observed polarization at $\lambda$ = 550 nm. While the
polarization dependence with wavelength at $(\epsilon$, $\beta)=(90^{\circ}$,
$0^{\circ})$ is modest (increasing from 17.7 $\pm$ 0.2% at 1.25 $\mu$m to 21.0
$\pm$ 0.3% at 3.5 $\mu$m), the variation is more pronounced at the North
Ecliptic Pole (23.1 $\pm$ 1.6, 35.1 $\pm$ 2.0 and 39.3 $\pm$ 2.1% at 1.25, 2.2
and 3.5 $\mu$m, respectively). The variation of ZL polarization with wavelength
is not explained by either Rayleigh scattering or by absorptive particles
larger than 10 $\mu$m.

Nested sampling algorithms by gradually discarding regions of low likelihood,
rather than gradually sampling regions of high likelihood. This alternative
mindset enables VARAHA to freely draw samples from anywhere within the
high-likelihood region of the parameter space, allowing for analyses to
complete in significantly fewer cycles. This means that VARAHA can
significantly reduce both the wall and CPU time of all analyses. VARAHA offers
many benefits, particularly for gravitational-wave astronomy where Bayesian
inference can take many days, if not weeks, to complete. For instance, VARAHA
can be used to estimate accurate sky locations, astrophysical probabilities and
source classifications within minutes, which is particularly useful for
multi-messenger follow-up of binary neutron star observations; VARAHA localises
GW170817 $\sim 30$ times faster than LALInference. Although only aligned-spin,
dominant multipole waveform models can be used for gravitational-wave analyses,
it is trivial to extend this algorithm to include additional physics without
hindering performance. We envision VARAHA being used for gravitational-wave
studies, particularly estimating parameters using expensive waveform models,
analysing subthreshold gravitational-wave candidates, generating simulated data
for population studies, and rapid posterior estimation for binary neutron star

perfused with a near-aortic waveform by an external pump, and permeability was
assessed by the movement of rhodamine-labelled albumin from the intracapillary
space to the extracapillary space. Confluence and quiescence of the cells was
confirmed by electron microscopy and measurements of glucose consumption and
permeability. The system was able to detect previously established influences
on permeability: tracer transport was increased by acute application of shear
stress and decreased by chronic shear stress compared to a static control, and
was increased by thrombin or an NO synthase inhibitor under chronic shear.
Increasing viscosity by addition of xanthan gum reduced permeability under both
acute and chronic shear. Addition of damping chambers to reduce flow
pulsatility increased permeability. Modifying the cartridge to allow chronic
convection across the monolayer increased effective permeability more than
could be explained the addition of convective transport alone, indicating that
it caused an increase in permeability. The off-the-shelf hollow fibre

convective and Forchheimer terms forces the velocity to live in a smaller space
than usual, we augment the variational formulation with suitable Galerkin type
terms. The resulting augmented scheme is written equivalently as a fixed point
equation, so that the well-known Schauder and Banach theorems, combined with
the Lax-Milgram theorem, allow to prove the unique solvability of the
continuous problem. The finite element discretization involves Raviart-Thomas
spaces of order $k\geq 0$ for the pseudostress tensor and continuous piecewise
polynomials of degree $\le k + 1$ for the velocity. Stability, convergence, and
a priori error estimates for the associated Galerkin scheme are obtained. In
addition, we derive two reliable and efficient residual-based a posteriori
error estimators for this problem on arbitrary polygonal and polyhedral
regions. The reliability of the proposed estimators draws mainly upon the
uniform ellipticity of the form involved, a suitable assumption on the data, a
stable Helmholtz decomposition, and the local approximation properties of the
Cl\'ement and Raviart-Thomas operators. In turn, inverse inequalities, the
localization technique based on bubble functions, and known results from
previous works, are the main tools yielding the efficiency estimate. Finally,
some numerical examples illustrating the performance of the mixed finite
element method, confirming the theoretical rate of convergence and the

union), computing $k$ disjoint bases (a.k.a. matroid base packing), and
covering the elements by $k$ bases (a.k.a. matroid base covering). These
problems generalize naturally to integral and real-valued capacities on the
elements. This work develops faster exact and/or approximation problems for
these and some other closely related problems such as optimal reinforcement and
matroid membership. We obtain improved running times both for general matroids
in the independence oracle model and for the graphic matroid. The main thrust
of our improvements comes from developing a faster and unifying push-relabel
algorithm for the integer-capacitated versions of these problems, building on
previous work by Frank and Mikl\'os [FM12]. We then build on this algorithm in
two directions. First we develop a faster augmenting path subroutine for
$k$-fold matroid union that, when appended to an approximation version of the
push-relabel algorithm, gives a faster exact algorithm for some parameters of
$k$. In particular we obtain a subquadratic-query running time in the
uncapacitated setting for the three basic problems listed above. We also obtain
faster approximation algorithms for these problems with real-valued capacities
by reducing to small integral capacities via randomized rounding. To this end,
we develop a new randomized rounding technique for base covering problems in
matroids that may also be of independent interest.

the amount of data that robots can be trained on. An aspirational goal is to

Such robots could collect and train on much larger datasets, and thus learn
more robust and performant policies. While reinforcement learning offers a
framework for such autonomous learning via trial-and-error, practical
realizations end up requiring extensive human supervision for reward function
design and repeated resetting of the environment between episodes of

self-improving robotic systems: given a small set of expert demonstrations at
the start, the robot autonomously practices the task by learning to both do and
undo the task, simultaneously inferring the reward function from the
demonstrations. The policy and reward function are learned end-to-end from
high-dimensional visual inputs, bypassing the need for explicit state
estimation or task-specific pre-training for visual encoders used in prior

transformation (QSVT), introduced by [GSLW, STOC'19, arXiv:1806.01838], is a
unifying framework to obtain QML algorithms. We provide a classical algorithm
that matches the performance of QSVT on low-rank inputs, up to small polynomial

$A\in\mathbb{C}^{m\times n}$, vector $b\in\mathbb{C}^{n}$, and bounded
degree-$d$ polynomial $p$, QSVT can output a measurement from the state
$|p(A)b\rangle$ in $O(d\|A\|_F)$ time after linear-time pre-processing. We show
that, in the same setting, for any $\varepsilon>0$, we can output a vector $v$
such that $\|v - p(A) b\|\leq\varepsilon\|b\|$ in
$O(d^9\|A\|_F^4/\varepsilon^2)$ time after linear-time pre-processing. This

S/N of a cross-correlation signal in the presence of noise has the potential to
bias the detection significance at the planetary velocity of optimisation.
However, we find that optimisation using the difference between a
signal-injected cross-correlation function and the direct cross-correlation
function (CCF) is more robust against over-optimisation of noise and spurious
signals. We additionally examine the robustness of weighting the contribution
of each order to the final CCF, and of S/N calculations. Using a prescribed

Yau's method [46] for hydrodynamic limits, for deriving KPZ equations with
time-dependent coefficients from time-inhomogeneous interacting particle
systems. To our knowledge, this is the first derivation of a time-inhomogeneous
KPZ equation whose solution theory has an additional nonlinearity that is
absent in the time-homogeneous case. So, we also show global well-posedness for
the SPDE. To be concrete, we restrict to time-inhomogeneous Ginzburg-Landau
SDEs. The method for deriving KPZ is based on a Cole-Hopf transform, whose
analysis is the bulk of this paper. The key ingredient for said analysis is a
``local"" second-order Boltzmann-Gibbs principle, shown by stochastic calculus
of the Ginzburg-Landau SDEs and regularity estimates for their Kolmogorov
equations, all of which likely generalizes to many other particle systems. This
addresses a ``Big Picture Question"" in [47] on deriving KPZ equations. It is
also, to our knowledge, a first result on KPZ-type limits in a non-equilibrium
like that in [6].

regularizer for preventing overfitting in neural networks. In this study, we
demonstrate that dropout can also mitigate underfitting when used at the start
of training. During the early phase, we find dropout reduces the directional
variance of gradients across mini-batches and helps align the mini-batch
gradients with the entire dataset's gradient. This helps counteract the
stochasticity of SGD and limit the influence of individual batches on model
training. Our findings lead us to a solution for improving performance in
underfitting models - early dropout: dropout is applied only during the initial
phases of training, and turned off afterwards. Models equipped with early
dropout achieve lower final training loss compared to their counterparts
without dropout. Additionally, we explore a symmetric technique for
regularizing overfitting models - late dropout, where dropout is not used in
the early iterations and is only activated later in training. Experiments on
ImageNet and various vision tasks demonstrate that our methods consistently
improve generalization accuracy. Our results encourage more research on
understanding regularization in deep learning and our methods can be useful
tools for future neural network training, especially in the era of large data.

construction for computing persistent homology of Euclidean point cloud data,
which we call the Delaunay-Rips complex (DR). Assigning the Vietoris-Rips
weights to simplices, DR experiences speed-up in the persistence calculations
by only considering simplices that appear in the Delaunay triangulation of the
point cloud. We document and compare a Python implementation of DR with other
simplicial complex constructions for generating persistence diagrams. By
imposing sufficient conditions on point cloud data, we are able to
theoretically justify the stability of the persistence diagrams produced using
DR. When the Delaunay triangulation of the point cloud changes under
perturbations of the points, we prove that DR-produced persistence diagrams
exhibit instability. Since we cannot guarantee that real-world data will
satisfy our stability conditions, we demonstrate the practical robustness of DR
for persistent homology in comparison with other simplicial complexes in
machine learning applications. We find in our experiments that using DR for an
ML-TDA pipeline performs comparatively well as using other simplicial complex
constructions.

model ToM by giving the speaker agent an internal listener model that is
trained alongside the speaker and used to rerank potential utterances. We
experiment with varying task difficulty, hypothesizing that models will acquire
more complex language to adapt to stronger environmental pressures. We find
that training speakers with a highly weighted ToM listener component leads to
performance gains in our image referential game setting. We also find some
evidence that increasing task difficulty in the training process results in
more fluent and precise utterances in evaluation. This suggests the potential
utility of further incorporating ToM, as well as other insights from child

frameworks. It enables the DETR to perform end-to-end detection. However, it
also faces challenges of lacking positive sample supervision and slow
convergence speed. Several recent works proposed the one-to-many matching
mechanism to accelerate training and boost detection performance. We revisit
these methods and model them in a unified format of augmenting the object
queries. In this paper, we propose two methods that realize one-to-many
matching from a different perspective of augmenting images or image features.
The first method is One-to-many Matching via Data Augmentation (denoted as
DataAug-DETR). It spatially transforms the images and includes multiple
augmented versions of each image in the same training batch. Such a simple
augmentation strategy already achieves one-to-many matching and surprisingly
improves DETR's performance. The second method is One-to-many matching via
Feature Augmentation (denoted as FeatAug-DETR). Unlike DataAug-DETR, it
augments the image features instead of the original images and includes
multiple augmented features in the same batch to realize one-to-many matching.
FeatAug-DETR significantly accelerates DETR training and boosts detection
performance while keeping the inference speed unchanged. We conduct extensive
experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on DETR
variants, including DAB-DETR, Deformable-DETR, and H-Deformable-DETR. Without
extra training data, FeatAug-DETR shortens the training convergence periods of
Deformable-DETR to 24 epochs and achieves 58.3 AP on COCO val2017 set with

applications for quantum computers and in quantum-metrology protocols. These
algorithms estimate the unknown strength of a unitary evolution. By using
coherence or entanglement to sample the unitary $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$ times, the
variance of the estimates can scale as $O(1/{N^2_{\mathrm{tot}}})$, compared to
the best ``classical'' strategy with $O(1/{N_{\mathrm{tot}}})$. The original
algorithm for quantum phase estimation cannot be implemented on near-term
hardware as it requires large-scale entangled probes and fault-tolerant quantum
computing. Therefore, alternative algorithms have been introduced that rely on
coherence and statistical inference. These algorithms produce quantum-boosted
phase estimates without inter-probe entanglement. This family of
phase-estimation algorithms have, until now, never exhibited the possibility of
achieving optimal scaling $O(1/{N^2_{\mathrm{tot}}})$. Moreover, previous works
have not considered the effect of noise on these algorithms. Here, we present a
coherence-based phase-estimation algorithm which can achieve the optimal
quadratic scaling in the mean absolute error and the mean squared error. In the

sign of the Bino mass parameter with respect to both the Higgsino and Wino mass
parameters. In such region of parameter space, the spin-independent elastic
scattering cross section of a Bino-like dark matter candidate in direct

suppressed. While these decay patterns weaken the reach of multi-lepton
searches at the LHC, the radiative decay opens a new window for probing dark

us to take into account the presence of X-ray spectral features due to the
multiphase component of the local ISM. An additional IONeq component is
included to model the WHIM absorption, instead of the traditional Gaussian

satellite system of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) from the properties of
individual dwarf galaxies located in the Pan-Andromeda Archaelogical Survey
(PAndAS) and the previously determined completeness of the survey. Using
forward modeling, we infer the slope of the luminosity function of the
satellite system, the slope of its spatial density distribution, and the
size-luminosity relation followed by the dwarf galaxies. We find that the slope
of the luminosity function is $\beta=-1.5\pm0.1$. Combined with the spatial
density profile, it implies that, when accounting for survey incompleteness,
M31 hosts $92_{-26}^{+19}$ dwarf galaxies with $M_\textrm{V}<-5.5$ and a
sky-projected distance from M31 between 30 and 300kpc. We conclude that many
faint or distant dwarf galaxies remain to be discovered around Andromeda,
especially outside the PAndAS footprint. Finally, we use our model to test if
the higher number of satellites situated in the hemisphere facing the Milky Way
could be explained simply by the detection limits of dwarf galaxy searches. We
rule this out at $>99.9\%$ confidence and conclude that this anisotropy is an
intrinsic feature of the M31 satellite system. The statistical framework we
present here is a powerful tool to robustly constrain the properties of a
satellite system and compare those across hosts, especially considering the
upcoming start of the Euclid or Rubin large photometric surveys that are
expected to uncover a large number of dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume.

outflow component, which is shifted relative to the ionized gas systemic
velocity, with mean $v_{max}$~280 km/s which correlates with the
$\Sigma_{SFR}$. We find that the mass-loading factor $\mu$ of our sample is
typically lower than in more massive galaxies from literature but higher than
in typical local dwarf galaxies. In the stellar mass range covered, we find
that $\mu$ increases with $\Sigma_{SFR}$ thus suggesting that for a given
stellar mass, denser starbursts in low-mass galaxies produce stronger outflows.
Thus, galaxies with higher $\mu$ tend to have lower metallicity, more intense
bursts, and higher EW([OIII]5007). Our results complement the picture drawn by
similar studies at lower redshift, suggesting that the removal of ionized gas
in low-mass SFGs driven by stellar feedback is regulated by their stellar mass

neural networks more interpretable. However, since a ground truth is in general
lacking, local post-hoc interpretability methods, which assign importance
scores to input features, are challenging to evaluate. One of the most popular
evaluation frameworks is to perturb features deemed important by an
interpretability method and to measure the change in prediction accuracy.
Intuitively, a large decrease in prediction accuracy would indicate that the
explanation has correctly quantified the importance of features with respect to
the prediction outcome (e.g., logits). However, the change in the prediction
outcome may stem from perturbation artifacts, since perturbed samples in the
test dataset are out of distribution (OOD) compared to the training dataset and
can therefore potentially disturb the model in an unexpected manner. To
overcome this challenge, we propose feature perturbation augmentation (FPA)
which creates and adds perturbed images during the model training. Through
extensive computational experiments, we demonstrate that FPA makes deep neural
networks (DNNs) more robust against perturbations. Furthermore, training DNNs
with FPA demonstrate that the sign of importance scores may explain the model
more meaningfully than has previously been assumed. Overall, FPA is an
intuitive data augmentation technique that improves the evaluation of post-hoc
interpretability methods.

vibrations have been monitored in two hydrothermally grown single-crystal
thorium dioxide samples along the (100) and (311) crystallographic directions.
The three independent elastic constants of the cubic crystal (C11, C12 and C44)
are determined from the measured bulk acoustic velocities. The longitudinal

Measurement of C44 and C12 was achieved by enhancing the intensity of
quasi-shear mode in a (311) oriented crystal by adjusting the polarization
angle relative to the crystal axes. We find the magnitude of softening of the
three elastic constants to be ~2.5% over the measured temperature range. Good
agreement is found between the measured elastic constants with previously
reported values at room temperature, and between the measured
temperature-dependent bulk modulus with calculated values. We find that
semi-empirical models capturing lattice anharmonicity adequately reproduce the

parameter from the experimentally derived temperature-dependent bulk modulus
and previously reported temperature-dependent values of volume thermal
expansion coefficient and heat capacity. This work presents measurements of the

neural architectures called vision transformers. Visual processing in these
models incorporates computational models that are claimed to implement
attention mechanisms. Despite an increasing body of work that attempts to
understand the role of attention mechanisms in vision transformers, their
effect is largely unknown. Here, we asked if the attention mechanisms in vision
transformers exhibit similar effects as those known in human visual attention.
To answer this question, we revisited the attention formulation in these models
and found that despite the name, computationally, these models perform a
special class of relaxation labeling with similarity grouping effects.
Additionally, whereas modern experimental findings reveal that human visual
attention involves both feed-forward and feedback mechanisms, the purely
feed-forward architecture of vision transformers suggests that attention in
these models will not have the same effects as those known in humans. To
quantify these observations, we evaluated grouping performance in a family of
vision transformers. Our results suggest that self-attention modules group
figures in the stimuli based on similarity in visual features such as color.
Also, in a singleton detection experiment as an instance of saliency detection,
we studied if these models exhibit similar effects as those of feed-forward
visual salience mechanisms utilized in human visual attention. We found that
generally, the transformer-based attention modules assign more salience either
to distractors or the ground. Together, our study suggests that the attention
mechanisms in vision transformers perform similarity grouping and not
attention.

Traditionally, such a learning problem is solved independently as a prediction
phase without considering the downstream task optimization phase. However, the
loss function used in prediction may be misaligned with our final goal, i.e., a
good routing decision. Good performance in the isolated prediction phase does
not necessarily lead to good decisions in the downstream routing task. In this
paper, we propose a framework that incorporates task optimization as a

training of the prediction model without using engineered intermediate loss
that is targeted only at the prediction performance. In the proposed framework,
task optimization (submodular maximization) is made differentiable by
introducing stochastic perturbations into deterministic algorithms (i.e.,
stochastic smoothing). We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework

'compilation' procedure which can translate any entangled nonlocal game into a
single-prover interactive protocol while preserving quantum completeness and
soundness, using cryptography to simulate the separation between the provers. A
candidate for such a procedure was introduced by Kalai et al. (STOC '23), who
defined a black-box cryptographic compilation procedure that applies to any
nonlocal game and showed that it preserves classical value. In this work, we
make progress towards a full understanding of the quantum value of the
single-prover protocols that result from applying the Kalai et al. compilation
procedure to entangled games.
  For the special case of CHSH, we prove that the Tsirelson bound holds under
the compilation procedure introduced by Kalai et al., and we also recover a
strong version of the 'rigidity' property that makes CHSH so useful. As an
application, we give a single-prover cryptographically sound classical
verification protocol for BQP, and we prove its soundness using our CHSH
rigidity analysis. Our protocol replicates the functionality of Mahadev's
protocol (FOCS '18) but with two advantages: (1) the protocol is conceptually
intuitive and requires fewer bespoke ingredients, and the soundness analysis is
simpler and directly follows the analysis of the nonlocal case, and (2) the
soundness analysis does not explicitly use the assumption of a TCF or an
adaptive hardcore bit, and only requires QFHE as a black box (though currently
the only known constructions of QFHE use TCFs).

modify the CGWB spectrum, making it a potential testing ground for BSM physics.
We consider the impact of general BSM scenarios on the CGWB, including an
arbitrary number of hidden sectors. We find that the largest amplitude of the
CGWB comes from the sector that dominates the energy density after reheating
and confirm the dominance of the SM for standard cosmological histories. For
non-standard cosmological histories, such as those with a stiff equation of
state $\omega >1/3$, like in kination, BSM physics may dominate and modify the
spectrum substantially. We conclude that, if the CGWB is detected at lower
frequencies and amplitudes compared to that of the SM, it will hint at extra
massive degrees of freedom or hidden sectors. If it is instead measured at
higher values, it will imply a period with $\omega >1/3$. We argue that for

This has several disadvantages, such as increased difficulty both in debugging

pump pulses with fields reaching ~100 kV/cm and a carrier frequency of 300 GHz,
at 4 K and 300 K, both experimentally and theoretically. We report several
novel findings concerning the nonlinear charge carrier dynamics in intense
sub-THz fields. (i) Harmonics of order up to n=9 are observed at room
temperature, while at low temperature we can resolve harmonics reaching even
n=13. The susceptibility per charge carrier at moderate field strength is as
high as for charge carriers in graphene, considered to be one of the materials
with the strongest sub-THz nonlinear response. (ii) For T=300 K, where the
charge carriers bound to acceptors are fully thermally ionized into the valence
subbands, the susceptibility values decrease with increasing field strength.
Simulations incorporating multi-valence-band Monte-Carlo and
finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) propagation show that here, the HG process
becomes increasingly dominated by energy-dependent scattering rates over the
contribution from band non-parabolicity, due to the onset of optical-phonon
emission, which ultimately leads to the saturation at high fields. (iii) At T=4
K, where the majority of charges are bound to acceptors, we observe a drastic
rise of the HG yields for internal pump fields of 30 kV/cm, as one reaches the
threshold for tunnel ionization. We disentangle the HG contributions in this
case into contributions from the initial 'generational'- and subsequent
band-nonlinearities, and show that scattering seriously degrades any coherent
recollision during the subsequent oscillation of the holes.

tremendous empirical success, the rigorous theoretical understanding of why

existing results are restricted to particular methods or approaches for
unsupervised pretraining with specialized structural assumptions. This paper
studies a generic framework, where the unsupervised representation learning
task is specified by an abstract class of latent variable models $\Phi$ and the
downstream task is specified by a class of prediction functions $\Psi$. We
consider a natural approach of using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for
unsupervised pretraining and Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) for learning
downstream tasks. We prove that, under a mild ''informative'' condition, our
algorithm achieves an excess risk of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\mathcal{C}_\Phi/m} + \sqrt{\mathcal{C}_\Psi/n})$
for downstream tasks, where $\mathcal{C}_\Phi, \mathcal{C}_\Psi$ are complexity
measures of function classes $\Phi, \Psi$, and $m, n$ are the number of
unlabeled and labeled data respectively. Comparing to the baseline of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\mathcal{C}_{\Phi \circ \Psi}/n})$ achieved by
performing supervised learning using only the labeled data, our result
rigorously shows the benefit of unsupervised pretraining when $m \gg n$ and
$\mathcal{C}_{\Phi\circ \Psi} > \mathcal{C}_\Psi$. This paper further shows
that our generic framework covers a wide range of approaches for unsupervised

that generates a host program that performs mini-batch sampling, manages

helps to have a better overall balance between poloidal kinetic energy,
involved in internal gravity waves, and potential energy. However, conversion
between kinetic energy and potential energy do not necessarily show
fluctuations around zero in our simulations, as we would expect for a system of

an average uncertainty of $\sim$0.04. The variability of $f_{spot}$ is periodic

$f^{mean}_{spot}$ to represent the total spot coverage, we calculated spot

in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is known to be polynomial-time solvable for fixed $m$.
Moreover, when $m=1$, the standard semidefinite relaxation is exact, and when
$m=2$, it has recently been shown that an exact relaxation can be constructed
via a disjunctive semidefinite formulation based on essentially two copies of
the $m=1$ case. However, there is no known explicit, tractable, exact convex
representation for $m \ge 3$. In this paper, we construct a new, polynomially
sized semidefinite relaxation for all $m$, and we demonstrate empirically that
it is quite strong compared to existing relaxations, although still not exact
for all objectives. The key idea is a simple lifting of the original problem
into dimension $n+1$. Related to this construction, we also show that nonconvex
quadratic programming over $\|x\| \le \min \{ 1, g + h^T x \}$, which arises
for example as a substructure in the alternating current optimal power flow

generates output strings that, after verification, can then be fed into a
randomness extractor to produce certified nearly-uniform bits -- thereby
""bootstrapping"" from pseudorandomness to genuine randomness. We prove our
protocol sound in two senses: (i) under a hardness assumption called Long List
Quantum Supremacy Verification, which we justify in the random oracle model,
and (ii) unconditionally in the random oracle model against an eavesdropper who
could share arbitrary entanglement with the device. (Note that our protocol's
output is unpredictable even to a computationally unbounded adversary who can
see the random oracle.) Currently, the central drawback of our protocol is the
exponential cost of verification, which in practice will limit its
implementation to at most $n\sim 60$ qubits, a regime where attacks are
expensive but not impossible. Modulo that drawback, our protocol appears to be
the only practical application of quantum computing that both requires a QC and

  Some existing methods for dependence graphs based on high-order partial

dependence graphs based on correlations and first-order partial correlations
might have dense graphs. When genes can be divided into groups with stronger
within group dependence in gene expression than between group dependence, we
present a dependence graph based on truncated vines with latent variables that
makes use of group information and low-order partial correlations. The graphs
are not dense, and the genes that might be more central have more neighbors in
the vine dependency graph. We demonstrate the use of our dependence graph
construction on two RNA-seq data sets -- yeast and prostate cancer. There is
some biological evidence to support the relationship between genes in the
resulting dependence graphs.
  A flexible framework is provided for building dependence graphs via low-order

Unlike [1], we present a real-time online motion planning algorithm. We build
discrete-time motion primitives and their corresponding continuous-time tubes

strongly dependent on the dynamical age of the clusters, the high-mass slope
($\alpha_3; m > 1 M_\odot$) is not, indicating that the mass function in this

this high-mass mass function slope suggests an IMF in this mass regime

speech is significantly lower than that of normal speech, it can be used as a
semi-silent speech interaction in public places without being audible to
others. Converting whispers to normal speech also improves the speech quality
for people with speech or hearing impairments. However, conventional speech
conversion techniques do not provide sufficient conversion quality or require
speaker-dependent datasets consisting of pairs of whispered and normal speech
utterances. To address these problems, we propose WESPER, a zero-shot,
real-time whisper-to-normal speech conversion mechanism based on
self-supervised learning. WESPER consists of a speech-to-unit (STU) encoder,
which generates hidden speech units common to both whispered and normal speech,
and a unit-to-speech (UTS) decoder, which reconstructs speech from the encoded
speech units. Unlike the existing methods, this conversion is user-independent
and does not require a paired dataset for whispered and normal speech. The UTS
decoder can reconstruct speech in any target speaker's voice from speech units,
and it requires only an unlabeled target speaker's speech data. We confirmed
that the quality of the speech converted from a whisper was improved while
preserving its natural prosody. Additionally, we confirmed the effectiveness of

Code comment generation aims to automatically predict comments in natural

integrating external knowledge on the quality of generated comments. In this
study, we propose a solution, namely APIContext2Com, to improve the
effectiveness of generated comments by incorporating the pre-defined
Application Programming Interface (API) context. The API context includes the
definition and description of the pre-defined APIs that are used within the
code snippets. As the detailed API information expresses the functionality of a
code snippet, it can be helpful in better generating the code summary. We
introduce a seq-2-seq encoder-decoder neural network model with different sets
of multiple encoders to effectively transform distinct inputs into target
comments. A ranking mechanism is also developed to exclude non-informative
APIs, so that we can filter out unrelated APIs. We evaluate our approach using
the Java dataset from CodeSearchNet. The findings reveal that the proposed
model improves the best baseline by 1.88 (8.24 %), 2.16 (17.58 %), 1.38 (18.3

large specific surface area and low noise. In many applications, graphene will
inevitably be in contact with oxygen since it is the second most abundant gas

affects the sensor properties. In this work, the effect of oxygen on the
low-frequency noise of suspended graphene is demonstrated. Devices with
suspended graphene nanoribbons with a width (W) and length (L) of 200 nm were
fabricated. The resistance as a function of time was measured in a vacuum and
pure oxygen atmosphere through an ac lock-in method. After signal processing
with wavelet denoising and analysis, it is demonstrated that oxygen causes
random telegraphy signal (RTS) in the millisecond scale, with an average dwell
time of 2.9 milliseconds in the high-resistance state, and 2 milliseconds in
the low-resistance state. It is also shown that this RTS occurs only at some
periods, which indicates that, upon adsorption, the molecules take some time
until they find the most energetically favorable adsorption state. Also, a
slow-down in the RTS time constants is observed, which infers that less active
sites are available as time goes on because of oxygen adsorption. Therefore, it
is very important to consider these effects to guarantee high sensitivity and
high durability for graphene-based sensors that will be exposed to oxygen

nowadays several techniques are being developed to study it. One of the main
concerns in the topic is how to classify a specific transition as being of
first, second, or even of a higher order, according to the Ehrenfest
classification. The partition function provides all the thermodynamic
information about the physical system, and a phase transition can be identified
by the complex temperature where it is equal to zero. In addition, the pattern
of the zeros on the complex temperature plan can provide evidences of the order
of the transition. In this manuscript, we present an analytical and
simulational study connecting the microcanonical analysis of the unstable
region of the entropy to the canonical partition function zeros. We show that
for the first-order transition the zeros accumulate uniformly in a vertical
line on the complex inverse temperature plane as discussed in previous works.
We illustrated our calculation using the $147$ particles Lennard-Jones cluster.
In the second-order case the zeros can assume different slops, besides that the
inverse distance between them following a power law with exponent $0<\alpha<1$.
For higher order phase transitions $\alpha > 1$ is expected. We studied the 2D
square lattice Ising model where we found $\alpha \approx 1.4$ which is
inconsistent with the expected transition for this model.

destruction of occluders. Most existing methods focus on visible human body
parts through some prior information. However, when complementary occlusions
occur, features in occluded regions can interfere with matching, which affects
performance severely. In this paper, different from most previous works that
discard the occluded region, we propose a Feature Completion Transformer
(FCFormer) to implicitly complement the semantic information of occluded parts
in the feature space. Specifically, Occlusion Instance Augmentation (OIA) is
proposed to simulates real and diverse occlusion situations on the holistic
image. These augmented images not only enrich the amount of occlusion samples
in the training set, but also form pairs with the holistic images.
Subsequently, a dual-stream architecture with a shared encoder is proposed to
learn paired discriminative features from pairs of inputs. Without additional
semantic information, an occluded-holistic feature sample-label pair can be
automatically created. Then, Feature Completion Decoder (FCD) is designed to
complement the features of occluded regions by using learnable tokens to
aggregate possible information from self-generated occluded features. Finally,
we propose the Cross Hard Triplet (CHT) loss to further bridge the gap between
complementing features and extracting features under the same ID. In addition,
Feature Completion Consistency (FC$^2$) loss is introduced to help the
generated completion feature distribution to be closer to the real holistic
feature distribution. Extensive experiments over five challenging datasets
demonstrate that the proposed FCFormer achieves superior performance and
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on occluded
datasets.

in 1990s and it has been well studied in the finance literature mainly focusing

Mean-Variance (MV) model of Markowitz, DR portfolios lack optimization theory
for justifying their often outstanding empirical performance. In this paper, we
first explain what the DR criterion tries to achieve in terms of portfolio
centrality. A consequence of this explanation is that practically imposed norm
constraints in fact implicitly enforce constraints on DR. We then derive the
maximum DR portfolio under given risk and obtain the efficient DR frontier. We
further develop a separation theorem for this frontier and establish a
relationship between the DR frontier and Markowitz MV efficient frontier. In
the particular case where the variance vector is proportional to the expected
return vector of the underlining assets, the two frontiers yield same efficient
portfolios. The proof techniques heavily depend on recently developed geometric
interpretation of the maximum DR portfolio. Finally, we use DAX30 stock data to
illustrate the obtained results and demonstrate an interesting link to the
maximum diversification ratio portfolio studied by Choueifaty and Coignard.

thermal conductivity profiles in the temperature range of 77--300~K are

There are several new innovations in this paper. Some of the main results are
as follows. Theorem~3.5.1 shows that one can view the Tate parameter of Tate
elliptic curve as a function on the arithmetic Teichmuller space of [Joshi,
2021a], [Joshi, 2022b]. The next important point is the construction of
Mochizuki's $\Theta_{gau}$-links and the set of such links, called Mochizuki's
Ansatz in {\S}6. Theorem~6.9.1 establishes valuation scaling property satisfied
by points of Mochizuki's Ansatz (i.e. by my version of $\Theta_{gau}$-links).
These results lead to the construction of a theta-values set ({\S}8) which is
similar to Mochizuki's Theta-values set (differences between the two are in
{\S}8.7.1). Finally Theorem~9.2.1 is established. For completeness, I provide
an intrinsic proof of the existence of Mochizuki's $\log$-links (Theorem
10.9.1), $\mathfrak{log}$-links (Theorem~10.15.1) and Mochizuki's log-Kummer

performance in various recognition tasks. However, both our preliminary
investigation and recent studies suggest that they may be less effective in
learning representations for fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR) since many
features helpful for optimizing SSL objectives are not suitable for
characterizing the subtle differences in FGVR. To overcome this issue, we
propose learning an additional screening mechanism to identify discriminative
clues commonly seen across instances and classes, dubbed as common rationales
in this paper. Intuitively, common rationales tend to correspond to the
discriminative patterns from the key parts of foreground objects. We show that
a common rationale detector can be learned by simply exploiting the GradCAM
induced from the SSL objective without using any pre-trained object parts or
saliency detectors, making it seamlessly to be integrated with the existing SSL
process. Specifically, we fit the GradCAM with a branch with limited fitting
capacity, which allows the branch to capture the common rationales and discard
the less common discriminative patterns. At the test stage, the branch
generates a set of spatial weights to selectively aggregate features
representing an instance. Extensive experimental results on four visual tasks
demonstrate that the proposed method can lead to a significant improvement in
different evaluation settings.

curse of dimensionality. Therefore, we propose a novel black-box optimization
algorithm where the black-box function is modeled using a neural network. Our

  without Phase",,,,,"cs.CV cs.GR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Synthesizing controllable motion for a character using deep learning has been
a promising approach due to its potential to learn a compact model without
laborious feature engineering. To produce dynamic motion from weak control
signals such as desired paths, existing methods often require auxiliary
information such as phases for alleviating motion ambiguity, which limits their
generalisation capability. As past poses often contain useful auxiliary hints,
in this paper, we propose a task-agnostic deep learning method, namely
Multi-scale Control Signal-aware Transformer (MCS-T), with an attention based
encoder-decoder architecture to discover the auxiliary information implicitly
for synthesizing controllable motion without explicitly requiring auxiliary
information such as phase. Specifically, an encoder is devised to adaptively
formulate the motion patterns of a character's past poses with multi-scale
skeletons, and a decoder driven by control signals to further synthesize and
predict the character's state by paying context-specialised attention to the
encoded past motion patterns. As a result, it helps alleviate the issues of low
responsiveness and slow transition which often happen in conventional methods
not using auxiliary information. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental
results on an existing biped locomotion dataset, which involves diverse types
of motion transitions, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In
particular, MCS-T is able to successfully generate motions comparable to those
generated by the methods using auxiliary information.

extensive attention due to its low cost and high efficiency. Although new
algorithms for camera-only 3D object detection have been continuously proposed,
most of them may risk drastic performance degradation when the domain of input
images differs from that of training. In this paper, we first analyze the
causes of the domain gap for the MV3D-Det task. Based on the covariate shift
assumption, we find that the gap mainly attributes to the feature distribution
of BEV, which is determined by the quality of both depth estimation and 2D
image's feature representation. To acquire a robust depth prediction, we
propose to decouple the depth estimation from the intrinsic parameters of the
camera (i.e. the focal length) through converting the prediction of metric
depth to that of scale-invariant depth and perform dynamic perspective
augmentation to increase the diversity of the extrinsic parameters (i.e. the
camera poses) by utilizing homography. Moreover, we modify the focal length
values to create multiple pseudo-domains and construct an adversarial training
loss to encourage the feature representation to be more domain-agnostic.
Without bells and whistles, our approach, namely DG-BEV, successfully
alleviates the performance drop on the unseen target domain without impairing
the accuracy of the source domain. Extensive experiments on various public
datasets, including Waymo, nuScenes, and Lyft, demonstrate the generalization
and effectiveness of our approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first systematic study to explore a domain generalization method for MV3D-Det.

travel demand forecasting models can thus simultaneously account for prediction

effectively addresses the accuracy-fairness trade-off. It can significantly
enhance fairness for multiple protected attributes (i.e., race, education, age

certain robot configurations. Considering that soft robots may exhibit distinct
dynamics under different robot configurations, a feature space transfer
strategy is also incorporated to promote the adaptation of latent features
across multiple configurations. Unlike existing transfer learning approaches,
our proposed DSVB employs a recurrent neural network to model the nonlinear

validated on multiple setup configurations of a pneumatic-based soft robot

performs effective transfer learning and accurate state inference amidst

Along with this correction, we probe the gravitational wave's effect on the
null geodesics, and photonsphere, and find constraints to the gravitational
wave parameter $\epsilon$ using the black hole shadow of M87* for some given
test value for the gravitational wave frequency $\sigma$. Not only that some
nodes were found in the light trajectory, but the general behavior of paths
changes in a periodic way as the time $t$ progresses. These patterns then
confirm the chaotic formation of the shadow seen by some remote observer.
Finally, the constraint that we find for $\epsilon$ is $~10^{-10}$ orders of
magnitude for the effect of the gravitational wave to be seen at a distance of
$D = 16.8$ Mpc. As a consequence of such a value for $\epsilon$, another result
reveals that while there is are gravitational wave effect on the shadow

the gravitational interaction between the Didymos binary system and the ejected

system input, output, and state can not be freely selected. This limits how
flexibly models are constructed, and in some circumstances, can introduce
errors because of the addition of virtual elements in order to connect the
mismatched ports of subsystem models. An extension known as descriptor state
space can model both proper and improper systems and is a promising candidate
for solving the noted problems. It facilitates a modular construction of power
system models with flexible choice of ports of subsystems. Algorithms for
mathematical manipulation of descriptor state space models are derived such as
preforming inverse, connection, and transform. Corresponding physical
interpretations are also given. Importantly, the proposed algorithms preserve
the subsystem states in the whole system model, which therefore enables the
analysis of root causes of instability and mode participation. Theoretical
advances are validated by example power systems of varied scales including a
single-inductor or -capacitor system, two-inductor or -capacitor system, and a
modified IEEE 14-bus generator-inverter-composite system.

localization of mobile targets, which can significantly speed up the selection
of the optimal high-directional narrow beam required for mmW communications
between the base station and mobile target. To bring JRC to reality, a radar
signal processing (RSP) accelerator, co-located with the wireless communication
physical layer (PHY), on edge platforms is desired. In this work, we discuss
the three-dimensional digital hardware RSP framework for 802.11ad-based JRC to
detect the range, azimuth, and Doppler velocity of multiple targets. We present
a novel efficient reconfigurable architecture for RSP on multi-processor
system-on-chip (MPSoC) via hardware-software co-design, word-length
optimization, and serial-parallel configurations. We demonstrate the functional
correctness of the proposed fixed-point architecture and significant savings in
resource utilization (~40-70), execution time (1.5x improvement), and power
consumption (50%) over floating-point architecture. The acceleration on
hardware offers a 120-factor improvement in execution time over the benchmark
Quad-core processor. The proposed architecture enables on-the-fly
reconfigurability to support different azimuth precision and Doppler velocity
resolution, offering a real-time trade-off between functional accuracy and
detection time. We demonstrate end-to-end RSP on MPSoC with a user-friendly
graphical user interface (GUI).

demonstrate nonlinear optical selectivity through selective excitation of
individual single-mode nanolasers based on the spin and orbital angular
momentum of light. Our designed nanolaser circuits consist of plasmonic
metasurfaces and individual perovskite nanowires, enabling subwavelength
focusing of angular-momentum-distinctive plasmonic fields and further selective
excitation of single transverse laser modes in nanowires. The optically
selected nanolaser with nonlinear increase of light emission greatly enhances
the baseline optical selectivity offered by the metasurface from about 0.4 up

important applications in all-optical logic gates and nanowire networks,

of machine learning models, and in particular on quantifying and eliminating
bias against protected subgroups. One line of work generalizes the notion of
protected subgroups beyond simple discrete classes by introducing the notion of
a ""rich subgroup"", and seeks to train models that are calibrated or equalize
error rates with respect to these richer subgroup classes. Largely
orthogonally, local model explanation methods have been developed that given a
classifier h and test point x, attribute influence for the prediction h(x) to
the individual features of x. This raises a natural question: Do local model
explanation methods attribute different feature importance values on average
across different protected subgroups, and can we detect these disparities
efficiently? If the model places high weight on a given feature in a specific
protected subgroup, but not on the dataset overall (or vice versa), this could
be a potential indicator of bias in the predictive model or the underlying data
generating process, and is at the very least a useful diagnostic that signals
the need for a domain expert to delve deeper. In this paper, we formally
introduce the notion of feature importance disparity (FID) in the context of
rich subgroups, design oracle-efficent algorithms to identify large FID
subgroups, and conduct a thorough empirical analysis that establishes auditing
for FID as an important method to investigate dataset bias. Our experiments
show that across 4 datasets and 4 common feature importance methods our
algorithms find (feature, subgroup) pairs that simultaneously: (i) have
subgroup feature importance that is often an order of magnitude different than
the importance on the dataset as a whole (ii) generalize out of sample, and
(iii) yield interesting discussions about potential bias inherent in these
datasets.

  However, often the predictions made by experts or algorithms at some time

shows that the natural deterministic algorithm, which iterates through pools of

imaging systems, many deep learning segmentation methods fail to perform well
on unseen data, which limits their real-world applicability. Recent works have
shown the benefits of extracting domain-invariant representations on domain
generalization. However, the interpretability of domain-invariant features
remains a great challenge. To address this problem, we propose an interpretable
Bayesian framework (BayeSeg) through Bayesian modeling of image and label
statistics to enhance model generalizability for medical image segmentation.
Specifically, we first decompose an image into a spatial-correlated variable
and a spatial-variant variable, assigning hierarchical Bayesian priors to
explicitly force them to model the domain-stable shape and domain-specific
appearance information respectively. Then, we model the segmentation as a
locally smooth variable only related to the shape. Finally, we develop a
variational Bayesian framework to infer the posterior distributions of these
explainable variables. The framework is implemented with neural networks, and
thus is referred to as deep Bayesian segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative
experimental results on prostate segmentation and cardiac segmentation tasks
have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method. Moreover, we investigated
the interpretability of BayeSeg by explaining the posteriors and analyzed
certain factors that affect the generalization ability through further ablation
studies. Our code will be released via https://zmiclab.github.io/projects.html,

world, we constantly face novel situations we have not encountered before. As
humans, we are competent at successfully adapting to those situations.
Similarly, an agent needs to have the ability to function under the impact of
novelties in order to properly operate in an open-world physical environment.
To facilitate the development of such AI systems, we propose a new testbed,
NovPhy, that requires an agent to reason about physical scenarios in the
presence of novelties and take actions accordingly. The testbed consists of
tasks that require agents to detect and adapt to novelties in physical
scenarios. To create tasks in the testbed, we develop eight novelties
representing a diverse novelty space and apply them to five commonly
encountered scenarios in a physical environment. According to our testbed
design, we evaluate two capabilities of an agent: the performance on a novelty
when it is applied to different physical scenarios and the performance on a
physical scenario when different novelties are applied to it. We conduct a
thorough evaluation with human players, learning agents, and heuristic agents.
Our evaluation shows that humans' performance is far beyond the agents'
performance. Some agents, even with good normal task performance, perform
significantly worse when there is a novelty, and the agents that can adapt to
novelties typically adapt slower than humans. We promote the development of
intelligent agents capable of performing at the human level or above when

realizing extreme massive MIMO systems envisioned for future wireless
communications in a scalable and power-efficient manner. However, the fact that
hybrid MIMO systems implement part of their beamforming in analog and part in
digital makes the optimization of their beampattern notably more challenging
compared with conventional fully digital MIMO. Consequently, recent years have
witnessed a growing interest in using data-aided artificial intelligence (AI)
tools for hybrid beamforming design. This article reviews candidate strategies
to leverage data to improve real-time hybrid beamforming design. We discuss the
architectural constraints and characterize the core challenges associated with
hybrid beamforming optimization. We then present how these challenges are
treated via conventional optimization, and identify different AI-aided design
approaches. These can be roughly divided into purely data-driven deep learning
models and different forms of deep unfolding techniques for combining AI with
classical optimization.We provide a systematic comparative study between
existing approaches including both numerical evaluations and qualitative
measures. We conclude by presenting future research opportunities associated
with the incorporation of AI in hybrid MIMO systems.

  Graph Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Many graph neural networks have been developed to learn graph representations
in either Euclidean or hyperbolic space, with all nodes' representations
embedded in a single space. However, a graph can have hyperbolic and Euclidean
geometries at different regions of the graph. Thus, it is sub-optimal to
indifferently embed an entire graph into a single space. In this paper, we
explore and analyze two notions of local hyperbolicity, describing the
underlying local geometry: geometric (Gromov) and model-based, to determine the
preferred space of embedding for each node. The two hyperbolicities'
distributions are aligned using the Wasserstein metric such that the calculated
geometric hyperbolicity guides the choice of the learned model hyperbolicity.
As such our model Joint Space Graph Neural Network (JSGNN) can leverage both
Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces during learning by allowing node-specific
geometry space selection. We evaluate our model on both node classification and
link prediction tasks and observe promising performance compared to baseline
models.

hydrological, physical, and chemical flows. We study its self-similar
solutions, which make up the profiles of many important experimentally measured
situations. We prove that there is a unique solution to the general
initial-boundary value problem in the one-dimensional setting. When
supplemented with boundary conditions from the physical models, the problem
exhibits a self-similar solution described with the use of the Erd\'elyi-Kober
fractional operator. Using a backward shooting method, we show that there
exists a unique solution to our problem.
  The shooting method is not only useful in deriving the theoretical results.
We utilize it to devise an efficient numerical scheme to solve the governing
problem along with two ways of discretizing the Erd\'elyi-Kober fractional
derivative. Since the latter is a nonlocal operator, its numerical realization
has to include some truncation. We find the correct truncation regime and prove
several error estimates. Furthermore, the backward shooting method can be used
to solve the main problem, and we provide a convergence proof. The main
difficulty lies in the degeneracy of the diffusivity. We overcome it with some
regularization. Our findings are supplemented with numerical simulations that
verify the theoretical findings.

single character edit operation (insertion, deletion, or substitution) is
performed at the left-end of the input string $T$, namely, we are interested in
the worst-case increase in the size of the CDAWG after a left-end edit

$T$, then the number of new edges added to the CDAWG after a left-end edit
operation on $T$ is less than $e$. Further, we present almost matching lower
bounds on the sensitivity of CDAWGs for all cases of insertion, deletion, and

a teacher agent guards the training of a student agent by intervening and

Nevertheless, in many real-world settings it is expensive or even impossible to
obtain a well-performing teacher policy. In this work, we relax the assumption
of a well-performing teacher and develop a new method that can incorporate
arbitrary teacher policies with modest or inferior performance. We instantiate
an Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, termed Teacher-Student Shared

trajectory-based value estimation. Theoretical analysis validates that the
proposed TS2C algorithm attains efficient exploration and substantial safety
guarantee without being affected by the teacher's own performance. Experiments
on various continuous control tasks show that our method can exploit teacher
policies at different performance levels while maintaining a low training cost.
Moreover, the student policy surpasses the imperfect teacher policy in terms of
higher accumulated reward in held-out testing environments. Code is available

interrupt supply chains and industries. To control these disruptions,
decision-makers must focus on supply chain resiliency. This paper proposes a
multi-stage, multi-period green supply chain design model and six resilience
strategies, with downstream and upstream disruptions taken into account to
analyze both the ripple and bullwhip effect, respectively. To control the
mentioned disruptions and handle the uncertainties of parameter estimations, a
two-stage stochastic optimization approach is devised. The objectives are to
minimize the total cost of disruption, and $CO_{2}$ emission under the
cap-and-trade mechanism as a government-issued emission regulation. The
proposed decision-making framework and solution approach are validated using a
numerical experiment followed by sensitivity analysis. The results show the
optimum structure of the supply chain and the best resilient strategies to
mitigate the ripple effect. Moreover, the effect of a decline in capacity of
facilities on the optimal solution and the applied resilient strategies is
investigated. This study provides managerial insights to help governments set
the proper amount of cap, and supply chain managers to predict the demand
behaviour of essential and non-essential products in the event of disruptions.

deeper FCDDs focusing on other powerful backbones to improve the performance of
damage detection and implement ablation studies on disaster datasets. The key

benefited technically demanding surgical procedures by providing real-time

a careful selection of the information provided to the surgeon is needed.
However, identifying optimal feedback modalities is challenging due to the
broad array of available options. To address this problem, we have developed an
open-source library that facilitates the development of multimodal navigation
systems in a wide range of surgical procedures relying on medical imaging data.
To provide guidance, our system calculates the minimum distance between the
surgical instrument and the anatomy and then presents this information to the
user through different mechanisms. The real-time performance of our approach is
achieved by calculating Signed Distance Fields at initialization from segmented
anatomical volumes. Using this framework, we developed a multimodal surgical
navigation system to help surgeons navigate anatomical variability in a
skull-base surgery simulation environment. Three different feedback modalities
were explored: visual, auditory, and haptic. To evaluate the proposed system, a
pilot user study was conducted in which four clinicians performed mastoidectomy
procedures with and without guidance. Each condition was assessed using
objective performance and subjective workload metrics. This pilot user study
showed improvements in procedural safety without additional time or workload.
These results demonstrate our pipeline's successful use case in the context of
mastoidectomy.

and they have become an important asset for internet trading. One of the main
drawbacks of cryptocurrencies is the high volatility and fluctuation in value.
The value of cryptocurrencies can change rapidly and dramatically, making them
a risky investment. Cryptocurrencies are largely unregulated, which can
exacerbate their volatility. The high volatility of cryptocurrencies has also
led to a speculative bubble, with many investors buying and selling
cryptocurrencies based on short-term price fluctuations rather than their
underlying values. Therefore, how to reduce the fluctuation risk introduced by
exchanges, transform uncertain prices to deterministic value, and promote the
benefits of decentralized finance are critical for the future development of
cryptos and Web 3.0.
  To address the issues, this paper proposes a novel theory as Automatic
Increase Market Systems (AIMS) for cryptos, which could potentially be designed
to automatically adjust the value of a cryptocurrency helping to stabilize the
price and increase its value over time in a deterministic manner. We build a
crypto, WISH (https://wishbank.wtf), based on AIMS in order to demonstrate how
the automatic increase market system would work in practice, and how it would
influence the supply of the cryptocurrency in response to market demand and
finally make itself to be a stable medium of exchange, ensuring that the AIMS
is fair and transparent.

rendering frames of scenes from novel camera viewpoints. Volumetric approaches
provide a solution for modeling occlusions through the explicit 3D
representation of the camera frustum. Multi-plane Images (MPI) are volumetric
methods that represent the scene using front-parallel planes at distinct depths
but suffer from depth discretization leading to a 2.D scene representation.
Another line of approach relies on implicit 3D scene representations. Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) utilize neural networks for encapsulating the continuous
3D scene structure within the network weights achieving photorealistic
synthesis results, however, methods are constrained to per-scene optimization
settings which are inefficient in practice. Multi-plane Neural Radiance Fields
(MINE) open the door for combining implicit and explicit scene representations.
It enables continuous 3D scene representations, especially in the depth
dimension, while utilizing the input image features to avoid per-scene
optimization. The main drawback of the current literature work in this domain
is being constrained to single-view input, limiting the synthesis ability to
narrow viewpoint ranges. In this work, we thoroughly examine the performance,
generalization, and efficiency of single-view multi-plane neural radiance
fields. In addition, we propose a new multiplane NeRF architecture that accepts
multiple views to improve the synthesis results and expand the viewing range.
Features from the input source frames are effectively fused through a proposed
attention-aware fusion module to highlight important information from different
viewpoints. Experiments show the effectiveness of attention-based fusion and
the promising outcomes of our proposed method when compared to multi-view NeRF

which tend to disappear as the forgery patterns are improved. To address the

unspecific facial part inconsistencies, which are inevitable weaknesses of
Deepfake videos. Mover randomly masks regions of interest (ROIs) and recovers
faces to learn unspecific features, which makes it difficult for fake faces to

some (possibly unknown) sequence of randomized policies whose time-variation
satisfies a mild condition. We further generalize our results to the setting

deterministically bounded and propose \texttt{SoftMW+} and \texttt{SSMW+} that

total dominator chromatic number $\chi_{td}(G)$ of $G$ is the least number of

Aharonov-Bohm oscillations originate from ballistic transport along the ring
arms. The oscillations can therefore be attributed to topological surface
states, which can maintain a quasi-ballistic transport regime in the presence
of disorder. Further insight on the phase coherence is gained by comparing with
similar Aharonov-Bohm-type oscillations in topological insulator nanoribbons
exposed to an axial magnetic field. Here, quasi-ballistic phase-coherent
transport is confirmed for closed-loop topological surface states in transverse

appearance of universal conductance fluctuations indicates phase-coherent
transport in the diffuse regime, which is attributed to bulk carrier transport.
Thus, it appears that even in the presence of diffusive $p$-type charge

inhomogeneities such as dark or bright spots. This paper presents asteroseismic
results to determine the rotation rates of $\delta$ Sct-type pulsating primary
stars in two eclipsing binary systems, AB Cas and OO Dra. After removing the
binarity-induced light variations from the archival TESS data and carefully
examining the combination frequencies, we identified 12 independent frequencies
for AB Cas and 11 frequencies for OO Dra, with amplitudes higher than $\sim$0.3
mmag, as $\delta$ Sct-type pulsation frequencies excited in each primary star.
The theoretical frequencies for seismic analysis were obtained by fully
considering the rotation effects. Grid fitting for various stellar properties,
such as mass, radius, metallicity, and rotation rate, yielded the best solution
for which theoretical frequencies and stellar parameters agreed well with the
observations. The rotation rate of the AB Cas primary was tightly constrained
to 0.81 $\pm$ 0.01 day$^{-1}$ ($f_{\rm rot} / f_{\rm orb}$ =
1.11$^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$), which is slightly faster than the synchronized
rotation. In contrast, the rotation rate of 0.63 $\pm$ 0.01 day$^{-1}$ for the
OO Dra primary is lower than the synchronous value of approximately 0.81
day$^{-1}$. Subsynchronous rotation is uncommon in short-period binaries, and
its physical mechanism is not yet well understood. Our results show that
asteroseismology can be used to precisely measure the rotation rate of
fast-rotating $\delta$ Sct stars and thus provide a valuable constraint on
rotation-orbit synchronization in close binary systems.

polar domains separated by a sequence of counter-rotating vortices

as domain walls. The balance between the domain wall energy and the

suboptimal domain structures (with a width larger than the one predicted by the

initiated by the nucleation of vortices and antivortices at the interface
between the SrTiO$_{3}$ and the PbTiO$_{3}$ layers. The vortices progressively

using solely the monomial basis can be performed, effectively reducing the

black hole (DCBH) formation. In addition, we consider for the first time the
effect of Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation from stars within host halos, i.e.,
internal radiation. We find that, with low threshold metallicities of $Z_{\rm

rather reduces the number density of DCBHs from $0.2$--$0.3$ to
$0.03$--$0.06~{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$. This is because star formation is suppressed due
to self-regulation, and the LW flux emitted by neighboring halos is reduced.
Only when $Z_{\rm th}$ is as high as $10^{-3}~{\rm Z}_{\bigodot}$, internal
radiation enhances the number density of DCBHs from $0.4$ to $1~{\rm
Mpc}^{-3}$, thereby decreasing the threshold halo mass above which at least one
DCBH forms from $2\times 10^{9}$ to $9\times 10^{8}~{\rm M}_{\bigodot}$. We
also find that halos with $M_{\rm halo} \gtrsim 10^{11}$--$10^{12}~{\rm

Auxiliary $B_0$ enhances coupling of laser to cluster-electrons via improved

dispersion of these energetic electrons and their angular distribution in

bigger clusters (radius $R_0 \approx 3-4$~nm) at high intensities $\approx
10^{16} - 10^{18}\,\Wcmcm$, we find $\overline{\mathcal{E}}_A\approx
36-70\,\Up$ similar to a small cluster ($R_0\approx 2$~nm), but total energy
absorption increases almost linearly with increasing cluster size due to more
number of available energy carriers.

is a practical yet challenging task in virtual avatar creation. Previous works
usually overlook the asymmetric motions between two hands and generate two
hands in a holistic manner, leading to unnatural results. In this work, we
introduce a novel bilateral hand disentanglement based two-stage 3D hand
generation method to achieve natural and diverse 3D hand prediction from body
dynamics. In the first stage, we intend to generate natural hand gestures by
two hand-disentanglement branches. Considering the asymmetric gestures and
motions of two hands, we introduce a Spatial-Residual Memory (SRM) module to
model spatial interaction between the body and each hand by residual learning.
To enhance the coordination of two hand motions wrt. body dynamics
holistically, we then present a Temporal-Motion Memory (TMM) module. TMM can
effectively model the temporal association between body dynamics and two hand
motions. The second stage is built upon the insight that 3D hand predictions
should be non-deterministic given the sequential body postures. Thus, we
further diversify our 3D hand predictions based on the initial output from the
stage one. Concretely, we propose a Prototypical-Memory Sampling Strategy (PSS)
to generate the non-deterministic hand gestures by gradient-based Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art models on the B2H dataset and our newly

entropies, frustrated magnetic oxides are ideal candidates for cryogenic
magnetocaloric refrigeration. While previous materials design has focused on
tuning the magnetic moments, their interactions, and density of moments on the
lattice, there has been relatively little attention to frustrated lattices.
Prior theoretical work has shown that the magnetocaloric cooling rate at the
saturation field is proportional to a macroscopic number of soft mode
excitations that arise due to the classical ground state degeneracy. The number
of these modes is directly determined by the geometry of the frustrating
lattice. For corner-sharing geometries, the pyrochlore has 50\% more modes than
the garnet and kagome lattices, whereas the edge-sharing \emph{fcc} has only a
subextensive number of soft modes. Here, we study the role of soft modes in the
magnetocaloric effect of four large-spin Gd$^{3+}$ ($L=0$, $J=S=7/2$)
Heisenberg antiferromagnets on a kagome, garnet, pyrochlore, and \emph{fcc}
lattice. By comparing measurements of the magnetic entropy change $\Delta S_m$
of these materials at fields up to $9$~T with predictions using mean-field
theory and Monte Carlo simulations, we are able to understand the relative
importance of spin correlations and quantization effects. We observe that
tuning the value of the nearest neighbor coupling has a more dominant
contribution to the magnetocaloric entropy change in the liquid-He cooling
regime ($2$-$20$~K), rather than tuning the number of soft mode excitations.
Our results inform future materials design in terms of dimensionality, degree
of magnetic frustration, and lattice geometry.

model-based backbone into several sub-features, and learns the map matrix to
map these sub-features into multiple action features; then, RRM learns weights

addressed. By introducing a reversible state transformation without changing
the output, the actual total disturbance affecting output performance of each
agent and matched with the control input of the transformed system is extracted
and estimated by extended state observers. Then, the control protocols based on
estimates of extended state observers, are designed by combing the output
feedback control ones to obtain output consensus and feedforward compensators
to attenuating the total disturbance of each agent actively. It is shown with a
rigorous proof that the outputs of all followers can track practically the
output of the leader, and all the states of the leader-follower multi-agent
systems are bounded. Some numerical simulations are performed to verify the
validity of the control protocols and theoretical result.

that promises to reduce both technical complexity and energy consumption is
event-based communication (EBC). While practical low-complexity implementations
of such systems have already been proposed, the general question of energy and
bandwidth efficiency remains open. In this paper, we compare these between EBC
and a system relying on classical uniform sampling. We show that EBC is indeed
much more energy efficient, and this comes at the cost of bandwidth efficiency.
Therefore EBC is particularly suitable in combination with ultra-wideband

revise existing curricula. We report from a case study where an existing
materials science module was modified to contain numerical simulation of the
materials: students use simulation software to explore the material's behavior
in simulated experiments. In particular, the Ubermag micromagnetic simulation
software package is used by the students in order to solve problems
computationally that are linked to current research in the field of magnetism.
The simulation software is controlled through Python code in Jupyter notebooks.
This setup provides a computational environment in which simulations can be
started and analyzed in the same notebook. A key learning activity is a project
in which students tackle a given task over a period of approximately 2 months
in a small group. Our experience is that the self-paced problem-solving nature
of the project work -- combined with the freedom to explore the system's
behavior through the simulation -- can facilitate a better in-depth exploration
of the course contents. We report feedback from students and educators both on
the training in material science and the Jupyter notebook as a computational

and which could be transferred to similar teaching activities in other subject
areas.

multi-task learning methods under different common settings and find out that
the existing methods make progress but there is still a large performance gap

potential has been used to solve the set of field equations. Furthermore, the
matching conditions for interior and exterior geometry have been discussed. We
have considered observation data of the compact star LMC X-4 and analyzed
thermodynamical properties (density, pressure, equation of state parameter,
square speed of sound, and equilibrium condition) analytically and graphically
to test the validity of the solution. The compact star is found to meet the
energy conditions. Through the causality condition and Herrera's cracking
concept, the stability analysis of the present model has been presented and it
confirms the physical acceptability of the solution. It has been shown that the
obtained interior solutions for compact stars are consistent with all necessary
physical criterions and therefore relevant as well as physically acceptable.

gap in detecting small objects compared to normal-scale objects. We for the
first time observe that existing bounding box regression methods tend to
produce distorted gradients for small objects and result in less accurate
localization. To address this issue, we present a novel Confidence-driven
Bounding Box Localization (C-BBL) method to rectify the gradients. C-BBL
quantizes continuous labels into grids and formulates two-hot ground truth
labels. In prediction, the bounding box head generates a confidence
distribution over the grids. Unlike the bounding box regression paradigms in
conventional detectors, we introduce a classification-based localization
objective through cross entropy between ground truth and predicted confidence
distribution, generating confidence-driven gradients. Additionally, C-BBL
describes a uncertainty loss based on distribution entropy in labels and
predictions to further reduce the uncertainty in small object localization. The
method is evaluated on multiple detectors using three object detection
benchmarks and consistently improves baseline detectors, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability of C-BBL
to different label systems and effectiveness for high resolution detection,
which validates its prospect as a general solution.

  potential and Stokes flows",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a numerical method based on the variational quantum
algorithm to solve potential and Stokes flow problems. In this method, the
governing equations for potential and Stokes flows can be respectively written
in the form of Laplace's equation and Stokes equations using velocity
potential, stream function and vorticity formulations. Then the finite
difference method and the generalised differential quadrature (GDQ) method are
applied to discretize the governing equations. For the prescribed boundary
conditions, the corresponding linear systems of equations can be obtained.
These linear systems are solved by using the variational quantum linear solver
(VQLS), which resolves the potential and Stokes flow problems equivalently. To
the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first study that incorporates the
GDQ method which is inherently a high-order discretization method with the VQLS
algorithm. Since the GDQ method can utilize much fewer grid points than the
finite difference method to approximate derivatives with a higher order of
accuracy, the size of the input matrix for the VQLS algorithm can be smaller.
In this way, the computational cost may be saved. The performance of the
present method is comprehensively assessed by two representative examples,
namely, the potential flow around a circular cylinder and Stokes flow in a
lid-driven cavity. Numerical results validate the applicability and accuracy of
the present VQLS-based method. Furthermore, its time complexity is evaluated by
the heuristic scaling, which demonstrates that the present method scales
efficiently in the number of qubits and the precision. This work brings quantum
computing to the field of computational fluid dynamics. By virtue of quantum
advantage over classical methods, promising advances in solving large-scale

distinguish clean from noisy data, while enabling a learning shortcut to
memorize the noisy examples. Interestingly, when PI becomes too predictive of
the target label, PI methods often perform worse than their no-PI baselines.
Based on these findings, we propose several enhancements to the

power system problems, such as optimal power flow (OPF), security-constrained
economic dispatch (SCED), and security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC).
Linear shift factors, i.e., power transfer distribution factors (PTDFs), are
widely applied to replace DC power flow constraints. However, the PTDF matrix
is extremely dense, making it difficult to solve security-constraint
optimization problems. This paper analyzes/investigates the computational
inefficiency of PTDF-based security constraints from the sparse structure
perspective of the primal-dual interior point method(IPM). Additionally, a
matrix transformation method is proposed for restoring the sparsity of the
linear system during IPM iterations. It turns out that the transformation
method is equivalent to solving the original optimization problem expressed in
pure voltage angle, which preserves the sparsity structure but introduces
additional variables and constraints proportional to one to two times the total
number of buses. The regular B-$\theta$ formulation is also a variant of the
proposed transformation. Numerical studies show that sparsity rather than the
size of variables and constraints is the key factor impacting the speed of
solving convex quadratic problems (QP), i.e., OPF and SCED problems. In
contrast, sparsity is less desirable when solving a mixed integer problem
(MIP), such as the SCUC problem, where reoptimization techniques are
significantly more critical and the dual simplex method is typically employed
rather than IPM.

and supplier, or employee and employer, and lead to inefficiencies. This paper
revisits the effect of search frictions on the firm size distribution when
challenging two common but strong assumptions: that all agents share the same
ranking of firms, and that agents meet all firms, whether small or large, at
the same rate. We build a random search model in which we relax those two
assumptions and show that the intensity of search frictions has a non monotonic
effect on market concentration. An increase in friction intensity increases
market concentration up to a certain threshold of frictions, that depends on
the slope of the meeting rate with respect to firm size. We leverage unique
French customs data to estimate this slope. First, we find that in a range of
plausible scenarios, search frictions intensity increases market concentration.
Second, we show that slopes have increased over time, which unambiguously
increases market concentration in our model. Overall, we shed light on the
importance of the structure of frictions, rather than their intensity, to
understand market concentration.

ejection of products from nuclear fusion during their evolution and terminating
explosions. Sources of nucleosynthesis are diverse: Stars with hydrostatic
nuclear burning eject some of the products, and core-collapse supernovae add
ejecta. Binary interactions lead to sources such as thermonuclear supernovae
and kilonovae. Tracing ejecta from sources, with their different frequencies
and environments, through the interstellar medium and successive star formation
cycles is the goal of model descriptions.
  A variety of formalisms exist, from analytical through semi-analytical,
numerical or stochastic approaches, gradually making descriptions of
compositional evolution of cosmic matter more realistic, teaching us about the
astrophysical processes involved in this complex aspect of our universe.
  Radioactive isotopes add important ingredients to such modelling: The
intrinsic clock of the radioactive decay process adds a new aspect to the
modelling algorithms that leads to different constraints on the important
unknowns of star formation activity and interstellar transports. Several
prominent examples illustrate how modelling the abundances of radioactive
isotopes and their evolution have resulted in new lessons; among these are the
galaxy-wide distribution of 26Al and 60Fe, the radioactive components of cosmic

(ML) algorithms to complete their ML-based tasks while adapting to diverse
environments, as mobile agents are usually powered by batteries. These
requirements can be fulfilled by Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as they offer
low power/energy processing due to their sparse computations and efficient
online learning with bio-inspired learning mechanisms for adapting to different
environments. Recent works studied that the energy consumption of SNNs can be
optimized by reducing the computation time of each neuron for processing a
sequence of spikes (timestep). However, state-of-the-art techniques rely on
intensive design searches to determine fixed timestep settings for only
inference, thereby hindering SNNs from achieving further energy efficiency
gains in both training and inference. These techniques also restrict SNNs from
performing efficient online learning at run time. Toward this, we propose
TopSpark, a novel methodology that leverages adaptive timestep reduction to
enable energy-efficient SNN processing in both training and inference, while
keeping its accuracy close to the accuracy of SNNs without timestep reduction.
The ideas of TopSpark include analyzing the impact of different timesteps on
the accuracy; identifying neuron parameters that have a significant impact on
accuracy in different timesteps; employing parameter enhancements that make
SNNs effectively perform learning and inference using less spiking activity;
and developing a strategy to trade-off accuracy, latency, and energy to meet
the design requirements. The results show that, TopSpark saves the SNN latency
by 3.9x as well as energy consumption by 3.5x for training and 3.3x for
inference on average, across different network sizes, learning rules, and
workloads, while maintaining the accuracy within 2% of SNNs without timestep

functions between the velocity and magnetic field. In this formulation, the
expressions of the turbulent fluxes: the turbulent electromotive force (EMF) in
the mean induction equation and the Reynolds and turbulent Maxwell stresses in
the momentum equation are obtained. Related to the expression of EMF, the
physical origin of the cross-helicity effect in dynamos, as well as other
dynamo effects, is discussed. In order to understand the actual role of the
turbulent cross helicity, its transport equations is considered. Several
generation mechanisms of cross helicity are discussed with illustrative
examples. On the basis of the cross-helicity production mechanisms, its effect
in stellar dynamos is discussed. The role of cross helicity in the momentum
transport and global flow generation is also argued. Characteristic features of
turbulence effects in fast reconnection are reviewed with special emphasis on
the role of cross helicity in localizing the effective resistivity. Finally, a
remark is addressed on an approach that elucidates the structure generation and
sustainment in extremely strong turbulence. An appropriate formulation for the
anti-diffusion effect, which acts against the usual diffusion effect, is
needed. Turbulence modeling approach based on such an analytical formulation is
also argued in comparison with the conventional heuristic modeling. The
importance of the self-consistent framework treating the non-linear interaction

advantage of a large workspace which better suits the clinical setting. In this
work, we present an optimization routine capable of generating the required
poses for the external magnets in order to control the position and orientation
of two magnetic robots. We show that at a distance of 15cm, minimal coupling
between the magnetic robots can be achieved (3.9\% crosstalk) each embedded
with 5mm diameter, 5mm length NdFeB magnets. At smaller distances, we observe
that the ability to independently control the robot torques decreases, but
forces can still achieve independent control even with alignment of the robots.
We test our developed control system in a simulation of two magnetic robots
following pre-planned trajectories in close proximity (60 mm) showing a mean
positional error of 8.7 mm and mean angular error of 16.7 degrees.

prerequisite for the successful realization of many spintronic devices, like,

few reports on electrically controlled spin precession in sFET-like devices.
These devices operated in the ballistic regime, as postulated in the original
sFET proposal, and hence need high SOC channel materials in practice. Here, we
demonstrate gate-controlled precession of spins in a non-ballistic sFET using
an array of narrow diffusive wires as a channel between a spin source and a
spin drain. Our study shows that spins traveling in a semiconducting channel
can be coherently rotated on a distance far exceeding the electrons mean free
path, and spin-transistor functionality can be thus achieved in non-ballistic
channels with relatively low SOC, relaxing two major constraints of the
original sFET proposal.

background knowledge and input examples. The goal is to learn a concept that
covers all positive examples, while not covering any negative examples. This
non-trivial task is often formulated as a search problem within an infinite
quasi-ordered concept space. Although state-of-the-art models have been
successfully applied to tackle this problem, their large-scale applications
have been severely hindered due to their excessive exploration incurring
impractical runtimes. Here, we propose a remedy for this limitation. We
reformulate the learning problem as a multi-label classification problem and
propose a neural embedding model (NERO) that learns permutation-invariant
embeddings for sets of examples tailored towards predicting $F_1$ scores of
pre-selected description logic concepts. By ranking such concepts in descending
order of predicted scores, a possible goal concept can be detected within few
retrieval operations, i.e., no excessive exploration. Importantly, top-ranked
concepts can be used to start the search procedure of state-of-the-art symbolic
models in multiple advantageous regions of a concept space, rather than
starting it in the most general concept $\top$. Our experiments on 5 benchmark
datasets with 770 learning problems firmly suggest that NERO significantly
(p-value <1%) outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of $F_1$ score,
the number of explored concepts, and the total runtime. We provide an
open-source implementation of our approach.

freedom, and the symmetry properties of relevant band edges (at K, Q, and
$\Gamma$ points) in high-symmetry stackings at 0 (R-type) and 60 (H-type)
degree angles, the important building blocks of moir\'e or atomically
reconstructed structures. We reveal distinct hybridization signatures of $S_z$
and $L_z$ in low-energy bands due to the wave function mixing between the
layers, which are stacking-dependent and can be further modified by EF and ID.
The H-type stackings favor large changes in the g-factors under EF, e. g. from
$-5$ to $3$ in the valence bands of the H$^h_h$ stacking, due to the opposite
orientation of $S_z$ and $L_z$ in the individual monolayers. For the low-energy
dipolar excitons (DEs), direct and indirect in $k$-space, we quantify the
electric dipole moments and polarizabilities, reflecting the layer
delocalization of the constituent bands. We found that direct DEs carry a
robust valley Zeeman effect nearly independent of the EF but tunable by the ID,
which can be experimentally accessible via applied external pressure. For the
momentum-indirect DEs, our symmetry analysis indicates that phonon-mediated
optical processes can easily take place. For the indirect DEs with conduction
bands at the Q point for H-type stackings, we found marked variations of the
valley Zeeman ($\sim 4$) as a function of the EF that notably stand out from
the other DE species. Stronger signatures of the coupled SVP are favored in
H-type stackings, which can be experimentally investigated in $\sim
60^\text{o}$ samples. Our study provides fundamental insights into the SVP of
van der Waals heterostructures, relevant to understand the valley Zeeman of DEs

spectrogram of each source, and then applying a phase recovery (or spectrogram
inversion) algorithm to retrieve time-domain signals. Typically, spectrogram
inversion is treated as an optimization problem involving one or several terms
in order to promote estimates that comply with a consistency property, a mixing
constraint, and/or a target magnitude objective. Nonetheless, it is still
unclear which set of constraints and problem formulation is the most
appropriate in practice. In this paper, we design a general framework for
deriving spectrogram inversion algorithm, which is based on formulating
optimization problems by combining these objectives either as soft penalties or
hard constraints. We solve these by means of algorithms that perform
alternating projections on the subsets corresponding to each
objective/constraint. Our framework encompasses existing techniques from the
literature as well as novel algorithms. We investigate the potential of these
approaches for a speech enhancement task. In particular, one of our novel
algorithms outperforms other approaches in a realistic setting where the
magnitudes are estimated beforehand using a neural network.

purportedly capable of hosting (quasi-) zero-energy Majorana modes. By using
Green functions and the scattering matrix formalism, we calculate the
conductance matrix and the local density of states (LDOS) for asymmetrically
tunnel coupled left ($\Gamma_L$, constant) and right ($\Gamma_R$) leads. In the
trivial phase, we find that the local conductances are distinctively affected
by variations in $\Gamma_R$: while $G_{LL}$ is essentially constant, $G_{RR}$
is exponentially suppressed as $\Gamma_R$ diminishes. In the topological phase
(bulk criterion), surprisingly, $G_{LL}$ and $G_{RR}$ are suppressed in the
exact same way, i.e., $G_{LL}=G_{RR}$. This nonlocal suppression of $G_{LL}$
scales with the hybridization between the Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and arises
from the emergence of a dip in the LDOS around zero energy at the left end of
the wire, which in turn affects the MZM-mediated local Andreev reflections. We
also present a Majorana transistor exploiting the nonlocality of the local
Andreev processes and the gate-controlled suppression of the LDOS. Finally, we

using the example of pneumothorax classification.
  Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, ViTs were fine-tuned for
lung disease classification using four public data sets: CheXpert, Chest X-Ray
14, MIMIC CXR, and VinBigData. Saliency maps were generated using transformer
multimodal explainability and gradient-weighted class activation mapping

VinBigData, and SIIM-ACR data sets using the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve analysis (AUC) and compared with convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). The explainability methods were evaluated with
positive/negative perturbation, sensitivity-n, effective heat ratio,
intra-architecture repeatability and interarchitecture reproducibility. In the
user study, three radiologists classified 160 CXRs with/without saliency maps
for pneumothorax and rated their usefulness.
  Results: ViTs had comparable CXR classification AUCs compared with
state-of-the-art CNNs 0.95 (95% CI: 0.943, 0.950) versus 0.83 (95%, CI 0.826,

toward pneumothorax tubes in the models. Radiologists found 47% of the
attention-based saliency maps useful and 39% of GradCAM. The attention-based

Hydrogen quenches the (higher) vibrational levels of N2 and some of its highly

higher quantities of radical and excited species are suspected to be produced.
The addition of hydrogen also leads to the formation of new species. In

audio beat matching (ABM), which aims to recommend the proper transition time

they can focus more on the creativity of video content. We formally define the
ABM problem and its evaluation protocol. Meanwhile, a large-scale audio
dataset, i.e., the AutoMatch with over 87k finely annotated background music,
is presented to facilitate this newly opened research direction. To further lay
solid foundations for the following study, we also propose a novel model termed
BeatX to tackle this challenging task. Alongside, we creatively present the
concept of label scope, which eliminates the data imbalance issues and assigns
adaptive weights for the ground truth during the training procedure in one

the relevant research concerning this scenario is not sufficient, and to the

binary synapses with minimal stochasticity, sacrificing potential performance

broadcasting all extracted features, the semantic encoder extracts the
disentangled semantic features, and then only the users' intended semantic

transmission efficiency. Within this framework, we further investigate two

we design a lightweight robust semantic BC network by exploiting a supervised

14 % for object detectors trained with simulated data. Additional experiments
reveal that this domain shift can be lowered by introducing a simple noise

their models. Recent works have sought to use a large language model (i.e.,

conducted on edge devices with limited memory, so reducing memory is crucial
but has been overlooked in previous TTA studies. In addition, long-term
adaptation often leads to catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation, which
hinders applying TTA in real-world deployments. Our approach consists of two
components to address these issues. First, we present lightweight meta networks
that can adapt the frozen original networks to the target domain. This novel
architecture minimizes memory consumption by decreasing the size of
intermediate activations required for backpropagation. Second, our novel
self-distilled regularization controls the output of the meta networks not to
deviate significantly from the output of the frozen original networks, thereby
preserving well-trained knowledge from the source domain. Without additional
memory, this regularization prevents error accumulation and catastrophic
forgetting, resulting in stable performance even in long-term test-time
adaptation. We demonstrate that our simple yet effective strategy outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks for image classification

propose a Domain Projection and Contrastive Learning (DPCL) approach for
generalized semantic segmentation, which includes two modules: Self-supervised
Source Domain Projection (SSDP) and Multi-level Contrastive Learning (MLCL).
SSDP aims to reduce domain gap by projecting data to the source domain, while
MLCL is a learning scheme to learn discriminative and generalizable features on
the projected data. During test time, we first project the target data by SSDP
to mitigate domain shift, then generate the segmentation results by the learned
segmentation network based on MLCL. At test time, we can update the projected
data by minimizing our proposed pixel-to-pixel contrastive loss to obtain
better results. Extensive experiments for semantic segmentation demonstrate the
favorable generalization capability of our method on benchmark datasets.

nebular emission lines for a sample of local galaxies. We explore the
dependence of the various morphological parameters on wavelength and
morphological type. Our goal is to quantify the difference in morphology
between the stellar and nebular components. We derive the nonparametric
morphological indicators of 364 galaxies from the CALIFA Survey. To calculate
those indicators, we apply the StatMorph package on the high-quality integral
field spectroscopic data cubes, as well as to the most prominent nebular
emission-line maps, namely [OIII]$\lambda$5007, H$\alpha$, and
[NII]$\lambda$6583. We show that the physical size of galaxies, M$_{20}$ index,
and concentration have a strong gradient from blue to red optical wavelengths.
We find that the light distribution of the nebular emission is less
concentrated than the stellar continuum. A comparison between the nonparametric
indicators and the galaxy physical properties revealed a very strong
correlation of the concentration with the specific star-formation rate and
morphological type. Furthermore, we explore how the galaxy inclination affects
our results. We find that edge-on galaxies show a more rapid change in physical
size and concentration with increasing wavelength due to the increase in
optical free path. We conclude that the apparent morphology of galaxies
originates from the pure stellar distribution, but the morphology of the ISM
presents differences with respect to the morphology of the stellar component.
Our analysis also highlights the importance of dust attenuation and galaxy
inclination in the measurement of nonparametric morphological indicators,
especially in the the wavelength range 4000-5000 \r{A}.

Bespoke has two significant merits. One is that it requires near zero cost for
designing the search space of neural networks. The other merit is that it

cost is minimal compared to the existing works. We conduct experiments

systematically performing dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations on
the two-particle level, we determine the location and the number of the vertex
divergences across the whole coexistence region adjacent to the first-order
metal-to-insulator transition. We find that the lines in the parameter space,
along which the vertex divergences occur, display a qualitatively different
shape in the coexisting metallic and insulating phase, which is also associated
to an abrupt jump of the number of divergences across the MIT. Physically, the
systematically larger number of divergences on the insulating side of the
transition reflects the sudden suppression of local charge fluctuation at the
MIT. Further, a systematic analysis of the results demonstrates that the number
of divergence lines increases as a function of the inverse temperature
${\beta\!=\!(k_\mathrm{B} T)^{-1}}$ by approaching the Mott transition in the
zero temperature limit. This makes it possible to identify the zero-temperature
MIT as an accumulation point of an infinite number of vertex divergence lines,
unveiling the highly nonperturbative nature of the underlying transition.

them by the well-designed pixel normalization, and finally estimates per pixel
attention weight via a pixel context integration. PPCR can be flexibly plugged
into modern CNNs with negligible overhead. Extensive experiments on five

placing or not placing trust in an institution. The agent makes use of Bayesian
learning in order to estimate the institution's true trustworthiness and makes
the decision to place trust based on myopic rationality. Using elements from
random walk theory, we explicitly derive the probability that such an agent
ceases placing trust at some point in the relationship, as well as the expected
time spent placing trust conditioned on their discontinuation thereof.
  We then continue by modelling two truster agents, each in their own
relationship to the institution. We consider two natural models of
communication between them. In the first (``observable rewards'') agents
disclose their experiences with the institution with one another, while in the
second (``observable actions'') agents merely witness the actions of their
neighbour, i.e., placing or not placing trust. Under the same assumptions as in
the single agent case, we describe the evolution of the beliefs of agents under
these two different communication models. Both the probability of ceasing to
place trust and the expected time in the system elude explicit expressions,
despite there being only two agents. We therefore conduct a simulation study in
order to compare the effect of the different kinds of communication on the
trust dynamics.
  We find that a pair of agents in both communication models has a greater
chance of learning the true trustworthiness of an institution than a single
agent. Communication between agents promotes the formation of long term trust
with a trustworthy institution as well as the timely exit from a trust
relationship with an untrustworthy institution. Contrary to what one might
expect, we find that having less information (observing each other's actions
instead of experiences) can sometimes be beneficial to the agents.

sampling frequency given by these two theorems are exactly the same; 2) the
Koopman operator-based sampling theorem can also provide finite bound of
sampling frequency for certain types of non-band-limited signals, which can not
be addressed by Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. These types of
non-band-limited signals include but not limited to, for example, inverse
Laplace transform with limited imaginary interval of integration, and linear
combinations of complex exponential functions. Moreover, the Koopman
operator-based reconstruction algorithm is provided with theoretical result of
convergence. By this algorithm, the sampling theorem is effectively illustrated
on several signals related to sine, exponential and polynomial signals.

in large-scale machine learning models requires training with massive datasets

on modeling and correcting bias in the data emerge as valuable approaches. In
this paper, we propose FairShap, a novel pre-processing (re-weighting) method
for fair algorithmic decision-making through data valuation by means of Shapley
Values. Our approach is model agnostic and easily interpretable, as it measures
the contribution of each training data point to a predefined fairness metric.
We empirically validate FairShap on several state-of-the-art datasets of
different nature, with a variety of training scenarios and models and show how
it outperforms other methods, yielding fairer models with higher or similar
levels of accuracy. We also illustrate FairShap's interpretability by means of
histograms and latent space visualizations. We believe that this work
represents a promising direction in interpretable and model-agnostic approaches
to algorithmic fairness that yield competitive accuracy even when only biased
datasets are available.

to decreased efficiency, extra expenses, and even incorrect diagnoses.
Therefore, we propose a retinal image enhancement method using a vision
transformer and convolutional neural network. It builds a cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network that relies on unpaired datasets. It consists of
two generators that translate images from one domain to another (e.g., low- to
high-quality and vice versa), playing an adversarial game with two
discriminators. Generators produce indistinguishable images for discriminators
that predict the original images from generated ones. Generators are a
combination of vision transformer (ViT) encoder and convolutional neural
network (CNN) decoder. Discriminators include traditional CNN encoders. The
resulting improved images have been tested quantitatively using such evaluation
metrics as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index
measure (SSIM), and qualitatively, i.e., vessel segmentation. The proposed
method successfully reduces the adverse effects of blurring, noise,
illumination disturbances, and color distortions while significantly preserving

the proposed method. Our testing PSNR is 31.138 dB for the first and 27.798 dB

process of water with dissolved salt in a standard natural convection system,

the open data progress in smart cities while considering the open data quality.
In the Czech Republic, and its National Open Data Catalogue (NODC), the open
datasets are usually evaluated based on their metadata only, while leaving the
content and the adherence to the recommended data structure to the sole
responsibility of the data providers. The interoperability of open datasets
remains unknown. This paper therefore aims to propose a novel content-aware
quality evaluation framework that assesses the quality of open datasets based
on five data quality dimensions. With the proposed framework, we provide a
fundamental view on the interoperability-oriented data quality of Czech open
datasets, which are published in NODC. Our evaluations find that
domain-specific open data quality assessments are able to detect data quality
issues beyond traditional heuristics used for determining Czech open data
quality, increase their interoperability, and thus increase their potential to
bring value for the society. The findings of this research are beneficial not
only for the case of the Czech Republic, but also can be applied in other
countries that intend to enhance their open data quality evaluation processes.

However, this class faces the same parameter issue as its classical

as demonstrated by Sahai and Vadhan (JACM, 2003). In this paper, we introduce
quantum analogues of triangular discrimination, which is a symmetric version of
the $\chi^2$ divergence, and investigate the quantum state testing problems for
quantum triangular discrimination and quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence (a
symmetric version of the quantum relative entropy). These new
$\mathsf{QSZK}$-complete problems allow us to improve the parameter regime for
testing quantum states in trace distance and examine the limitations of
existing approaches to polarization. Additionally, we prove that the quantum
state testing for trace distance with negligible errors is in $\mathsf{PP}$

suggests that achieving length-preserving polarization for QSDP seems
implausible unless $\mathsf{QSZK}$ is in $\mathsf{PP}$.

constructed in the renormalization group theory via the coordinate-independent
iterative procedure, leading to the Dymnikova regular black hole. We show that
while the fundamental mode is only slightly affected by the quantum correction,
the overtones change at a much stronger rate. This outburst of overtones occurs
because of the deformation of the geometry of the Schwarzschild black hole
solely near the event horizon. For finding accurate values of overtones we
developed a general procedure allowing one to use the Leaver method to metrics
which, initially, are not expressed in terms of rational functions.

topological phase transition from the normal metal to topological metal phases,
which are protected by inversion symmetry. Remarkably, topological metal
without nontrivial edge states is found, and the bulk-boundary correspondence
breaks down. Secondly, the two-dimensional quantum wire arrays with alternated
slide manifests similar physical behaviors. Two types of topological metal
phases emerge, where there are gapless bulk bands with and without nontrivial
edge states. These results could be confirmed by current experimental
techniques.

titled Unified Perception that achieves state-of-the-art performance without

tracking algorithm that (re)uses object embeddings computed in an image-based
network. Experimental results on the Cityscapes-DVPS dataset demonstrate that
our method achieves an overall DVPQ of 57.1, surpassing state-of-the-art

long-term object association on KITTI-STEP, achieving an STQ of 59.1 which
exceeded the performance of state-of-the-art methods that employ the same

$\text{Uniform}(\theta_0 - 1, \theta_0 + 1)$ distribution, the sample midrange
$\frac{Y_{(n)}+Y_{(1)}}{2}$ is the MLE for $\theta_0$ and estimates $\theta_0$
with error of order $1/n$, which is much smaller compared with the $1/\sqrt{n}$
error rate of the usual sample mean estimator. However, the sample midrange
performs poorly when the data has say the Gaussian $N(\theta_0, 1)$
distribution, with an error rate of $1/\sqrt{\log n}$. In this paper, we
propose an estimator of the location $\theta_0$ with a rate of convergence that
can, in many settings, adapt to the underlying distribution which we assume to
be symmetric around $\theta_0$ but is otherwise unknown. When the underlying
distribution is compactly supported, we show that our estimator attains a rate
of convergence of $n^{-\frac{1}{\alpha}}$ up to polylog factors, where the rate
parameter $\alpha$ can take on any value in $(0, 2]$ and depends on the moments
of the underlying distribution. Our estimator is formed by the
$\ell^\gamma$-center of the data, for a $\gamma\geq2$ chosen in a data-driven
way -- by minimizing a criterion motivated by the asymptotic variance. Our
approach can be directly applied to the regression setting where $\theta_0$ is
a function of observed features and motivates the use of $\ell^\gamma$ loss
function for $\gamma > 2$ in certain settings.

have proven effective for IR applications, such as Plagiarism Detection or
Literature Recommender Systems in academic disciplines that use many

often employ mathematical concepts through formula notation to refer to prior

apply this generalized method to both classical references and mathematical
concepts. In this paper, we suggest how mathematical formulas could be cited
and define a Formula Concept Retrieval task with two subtasks: Formula Concept
Discovery (FCD) and Formula Concept Recognition (FCR). While FCD aims at the
definition and exploration of a 'Formula Concept' that names bundled equivalent
representations of a formula, FCR is designed to match a given formula to a
prior assigned unique mathematical concept identifier. We present machine
learning-based approaches to address the FCD and FCR tasks. We then evaluate
these approaches on a standardized test collection (NTCIR arXiv dataset). Our
FCD approach yields a precision of 68% for retrieving equivalent
representations of frequent formulas and a recall of 72% for extracting the
formula name from the surrounding text. FCD and FCR enable the citation of
formulas within mathematical documents and facilitate semantic search and

to predict individual grip force variability in manual robot control. Grip
forces were recorded from various loci in the dominant and non dominant hands
of individuals by means of wearable wireless sensor technology. Statistical
analyses bring to the fore skill specific temporal variations in thousands of
grip forces of a complete novice and a highly proficient expert in manual robot
control. A brain inspired neural network model that uses the output metric of a
Self Organizing Map with unsupervised winner take all learning was run on the
sensor output from both hands of each user. The neural network metric expresses
the difference between an input representation and its model representation at
any given moment in time t and reliably captures the differences between novice
and expert performance in terms of grip force variability.Functionally
motivated spatiotemporal analysis of individual average grip forces, computed
for time windows of constant size in the output of a restricted amount of
task-relevant sensors in the dominant (preferred) hand, reveal finger-specific
synergies reflecting robotic task skill. The analyses lead the way towards grip
force monitoring in real time to permit tracking task skill evolution in
trainees, or identify individual proficiency levels in human robot interaction

  Engineering (ICSE) 2022",,,,"cs.CR cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Web services use server-side input sanitization to guard against harmful
input. Some web services publish their sanitization logic to make their client
interface more usable, e.g., allowing clients to debug invalid requests
locally. However, this usability practice poses a security risk. Specifically,
services may share the regexes they use to sanitize input strings -- and
regex-based denial of service (ReDoS) is an emerging threat. Although prominent
service outages caused by ReDoS have spurred interest in this topic, we know
little about the degree to which live web services are vulnerable to ReDoS.
  In this paper, we conduct the first black-box study measuring the extent of
ReDoS vulnerabilities in live web services. We apply the Consistent
Sanitization Assumption: that client-side sanitization logic, including
regexes, is consistent with the sanitization logic on the server-side. We
identify a service's regex-based input sanitization in its HTML forms or its
API, find vulnerable regexes among these regexes, craft ReDoS probes, and
pinpoint vulnerabilities. We analyzed the HTML forms of 1,000 services and the
APIs of 475 services. Of these, 355 services publish regexes; 17 services
publish unsafe regexes; and 6 services are vulnerable to ReDoS through their
APIs (6 domains; 15 subdomains). Both Microsoft and Amazon Web Services patched
their web services as a result of our disclosure. Since these vulnerabilities
were from API specifications, not HTML forms, we proposed a ReDoS defense for a
popular API validation library, and our patch has been merged. To summarize: in
client-visible sanitization logic, some web services advertise ReDoS
vulnerabilities in plain sight. Our results motivate short-term patches and
long-term fundamental solutions.

stylization, and compression of 3D shapes. Existing methods either use simple
parametric primitives or learn a generative shape space of parts. Both have
limitations: parametric primitives lead to coarse approximations, while learned
parts offer too little control over the decomposition. We instead propose to
decompose shapes using a library of 3D parts provided by the user, giving full
control over the choice of parts. The library can contain parts with
high-quality geometry that are suitable for a given category, resulting in
meaningful decompositions with clean geometry. The type of decomposition can
also be controlled through the choice of parts in the library. Our method works
via a self-supervised approach that iteratively retrieves parts from the

reconstruction accuracy and more desirable decompositions than existing
approaches. Additionally, we show how the decomposition can be controlled
through the part library by using different part libraries to reconstruct the

developments in autonomous driving and robotics. However, due to the
limitations of LiDAR sensors, object shapes suffer from deterioration in
occluded and distant areas, which creates a fundamental challenge to 3D
perception. Existing methods estimate specific 3D shapes and achieve remarkable
performance. However, these methods rely on extensive computation and memory,
causing imbalances between accuracy and real-time performance. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a novel LiDAR-based 3D object detection model named
BSH-Det3D, which applies an effective way to enhance spatial features by
estimating complete shapes from a bird's eye view (BEV). Specifically, we
design the Pillar-based Shape Completion (PSC) module to predict the
probability of occupancy whether a pillar contains object shapes. The PSC
module generates a BEV shape heatmap for each scene. After integrating with
heatmaps, BSH-Det3D can provide additional information in shape deterioration
areas and generate high-quality 3D proposals. We also design an attention-based
densification fusion module (ADF) to adaptively associate the sparse features
with heatmaps and raw points. The ADF module integrates the advantages of
points and shapes knowledge with negligible overheads. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI benchmark achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in terms of
accuracy and speed, demonstrating the efficiency and flexibility of BSH-Det3D.

Thus, we propose zero-shot object counting (ZSC), a new setting where only the
class name is available during test time. Such a counting system does not
require human annotators in the loop and can operate automatically. Starting
from a class name, we propose a method that can accurately identify the optimal

construct a class prototype to select the patches that are likely to contain
the objects of interest, namely class-relevant patches. Furthermore, we
introduce a model that can quantitatively measure how suitable an arbitrary

significant potential in others, such as electromobility. Generally, their
stable operation is at the expense of numerous sensors, communication burdens,
and complicated balancing strategies that challenge their expansion to cost
driven applications. Hence, the introduction of a sensorless voltage balancing
strategy with a simple controller is an attractive objective. Diode clamped
MMCs offer a simple yet effective solution by providing a unidirectional
balancing path between two modules through a diode, and ideally, the modulation
technique should compensate for the lack of bidirectional energy transfer.
Hence open loop operation is possible. Although the open loop operation is
desirable to reduce costs, good knowledge of the modules voltages for system
monitoring and protection functions still appears mandatory. This paper
develops a compensated state space model for diode clamped MMCs and integrates
it with an optimal estimator to reliably estimate the voltage of all modules
without any direct measurement at module terminals. Additionally, the model
considers the effect of the diode clamped branches and their balancing effect,

However, current hardware limitations (including limited coherence times, gate

implementation of most quantum algorithms and call for more noise-resilient
solutions. In quantum chemistry, the limited number of available qubits and
gate operations is particularly restrictive since, for each molecular orbital,
one needs, in general, two qubits. In this study, we propose an explicitly

the Hamiltonian, thus reducing the number of resources needed to achieve
accurate results with noisy, near-term quantum devices. In particular, we show
that the exact transcorrelated approach not only allows for more shallow

plasmas with magnetic fields characterized by island chains and regions of

performed in the DIII-D tokamak, which utilize electron cyclotron heating and
current drive pulses to tag electron populations within different locations
across the discharge. The cross-field transport of these populations is then
inferred from electron cyclotron emission measurements and gamma emission
signals from scintillator detectors. Two types of energetic particles are
distinguished and discussed: nonrelativistic suprathermal electrons and
relativistic runaway electrons. The magnetic field topology in each discharge
is reconstructed with field line tracing codes, which are also used to
determine the location and scale of magnetic islands and stochastic regions.
Comparison of simulations and experiments suggests that suprathermal transport
is suppressed when the tagging is performed at a smaller radial location than
the location of the q=1 island chain, and enhanced otherwise. We further
demonstrate that increasing the width of the stochastic region within the edge
plasma yields enhancement of the suprathermal electron transport.

increase in harder but frequently seen examples from training, 2) changes in

fixing a distribution on $X$ while varying the conditional distribution of $Y

define a hypothetical distribution on $X$ consisting of values common in both

predictive performance. We estimate performance on this hypothetical

Thermal diffusivity is obtained from the phase delay between source and probe
signals. We combine this technique with a microscope setup in an optical
cryostat, in which the sample is placed on a 3-axis piezo-stage, allowing for
spatially resolved measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally and
mathematically that isotropic in-plane diffusivity can be obtained when
overlapping the two laser beams instead of separating them in the traditional
way, which further enhances the spatial resolution to a micron scale,
especially valuable when studying inhomogeneous or multidomain samples. We
discuss in detail the experimental conditions under which this technique is
valuable, and demonstrate its performance on two stoichiometric bilayer
ruthenates: Sr3Ru2O7 and Ca3Ru2O7. The spatial resolution allowed us to study
the diffusivity in single domains of the latter, and we uncovered a

enhanced spatial resolution enabled by overlapping the two beams to measure
temperature-dependent diffusivity of Ti-doped Ca3Ru2O7, which exhibits a

the product of the remaining edges of the subgraph. We define a homogeneous

galaxy database, and literature analyses, I present the largest sample of type
Ia supernova (SN Ia) siblings to date. The sample comprises 158 galaxies,
consisting of 327 confirmed SNe Ia - over 10 times larger than existing sibling
SN Ia samples. SN siblings share host galaxies, and thus share global
environmental properties and associated systematic uncertainties. This makes
them valuable for both cosmological and astrophysical analyses; for example,
sibling SNe Ia allow for comparison of environmental properties within the same
galaxy, progenitor comparisons, rates analyses, and multiple calibrations of
the Hubble-Lema\^{\i}tre constant. This large sample will provide a variety of
new avenues of research, and be of great interest to the wider SN Ia community.
To give an example use of this sample, I define a cosmology sub-sample of 50
siblings; and use it to compare light-curve properties between sibling pairs. I
find no evidence for correlations in stretch ($x_1$) and colour ($c$) between
pairs of siblings. Moreover, by comparing to a simulation of a comparable set
of random pairs of SNe Ia, I find that siblings are no more similar in $x_1$
and $c$ than any random pair of SNe Ia. Given that siblings share the same
hosts, differences in $x_1$ and $c$ between siblings cannot be due to global
galaxy properties. This raises important questions regarding environmental
systematics for SN Ia standardisation in cosmology, and motivates future
analyses of sibling SNe Ia.

gravitational wave strain predicted by general relativity, which has yet to be
detected. Within general relativity, its dominant component, known as the null
memory, can be understood as arising from the back-reaction of the energy
carried by gravitational waves, and therefore it corresponds to a direct
manifestation of the non-linearity of the theory. In this paper, we investigate
the null memory prediction in a broad class of modified gravity theories, with
the aim of exploring potential lessons to be learned from future measurements
of the memory effect. Based on Isaacson's approach to the leading-order field
equations, we in particular compute the null memory for the most general
scalar-vector-tensor theory with second order equations of motion and vanishing
field-potentials. We find that the functional form of the null memory is only
modified through the potential presence of additional radiative null energy
sources in the theory. We subsequently generalize this result by proving a
theorem that states that the simple structure of the tensor null memory
equation remains unaltered in any metric theory whose massless gravitational
fields satisfy decoupled wave equations to first order in perturbation theory,
which encompasses a large class of viable extensions to general relativity.

dataset of binary risky choice. We quantitatively account for the fraction of
choice reversals between two repetitions of the experiment, using a
probabilistic choice formulation in the simplest form without model assumption
or adjustable parameters. The prediction of choice reversal is then refined by
introducing heterogeneity between decision makers through their differentiation
into two groups: ``majoritarian'' and ``contrarian'' (in proportion 3:1). This
supports the first fundamental tenet of QDT, which models choice as an inherent
probabilistic process, where the probability of a prospect can be expressed as
the sum of its utility and attraction factors. We propose to parameterise the
utility factor with a stochastic version of cumulative prospect theory
(logit-CPT), and the attraction factor with a constant absolute risk aversion
(CARA) function. For this dataset, and penalising the larger number of QDT
parameters via the Wilks test of nested hypotheses, the QDT model is found to
perform significantly better than logit-CPT at both the aggregate and
individual levels, and for all considered fit criteria for the first experiment
iteration and for predictions (second ``out-of-sample'' iteration). The
distinctive QDT effect captured by the attraction factor is mostly appreciable
(i.e., most relevant and strongest in amplitude) for prospects with big losses.
Our quantitative analysis of the experimental results supports the existence of
an intrinsic limit of predictability, which is associated with the inherent
probabilistic nature of choice. The results of the paper can find applications
both in the prediction of choice of human decision makers as well as for
organizing the operation of artificial intelligence.

the transmission is perfect, but no phase shift is induced making the defect

different problems in physics where detection and characterization are
necessary. Data analysis in gravitational-wave astronomy is a prime example of
such a case. Bayesian inference has been very successful because this technique
provides a representation of the parameters as a posterior probability
distribution, with uncertainties informed by the precision of the experimental
measurements. During the last couple of decades, many specific advances have
been proposed and employed in order to solve a large variety of different
problems. In this work, we present a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm
that integrates many of those concepts into a single MCMC package. For this
purpose, we have built {\tt Eryn}, a user-friendly and multipurpose toolbox for
Bayesian inference, which can be utilized for solving parameter estimation and
model selection problems, ranging from simple inference questions, to those
with large-scale model variation requiring trans-dimensional MCMC methods, like
the LISA global fit problem. In this paper, we describe this sampler package
and illustrate its capabilities on a variety of use cases.

agent satisfying two properties. First, the player does not need to know the
policy of the opponent to update its policy. Second, when both players adopt
the algorithm, their joint policy converges to a Nash equilibrium of the game.
To this end, we construct a meta algorithm, dubbed as $\texttt{Homotopy-PO}$,
which provably finds a Nash equilibrium at a global linear rate. In particular,
$\texttt{Homotopy-PO}$ interweaves two base algorithms $\texttt{Local-Fast}$
and $\texttt{Global-Slow}$ via homotopy continuation. $\texttt{Local-Fast}$ is
an algorithm that enjoys local linear convergence while $\texttt{Global-Slow}$
is an algorithm that converges globally but at a slower sublinear rate. By
switching between these two base algorithms, $\texttt{Global-Slow}$ essentially
serves as a ``guide'' which identifies a benign neighborhood where
$\texttt{Local-Fast}$ enjoys fast convergence. However, since the exact size of
such a neighborhood is unknown, we apply a doubling trick to switch between
these two base algorithms. The switching scheme is delicately designed so that
the aggregated performance of the algorithm is driven by $\texttt{Local-Fast}$.
Furthermore, we prove that $\texttt{Local-Fast}$ and $\texttt{Global-Slow}$ can
both be instantiated by variants of optimistic gradient descent/ascent (OGDA)
method, which is of independent interest.

generic FLRW solution. However, due to the presence of torsion the Weyl tensors
might not vanish. The coupling between the torsion and Weyl tensors leads to
the conclusion that, in this cosmological model, the universe must either be

open case, we derive a wave equation for the traceless part of the magnetic

in this cosmological model, it is found that the torsion tensor, which has an

At the same time, the dynamic range of the MIR SED slopes is better reproduced
by the disk structure (e.g. inner radius, flaring) than by the dust evolution.
Our model series do not reproduce the observed trend between continuum flux at
850 {\mu}m and the MIR HCN/H2O blend ratio. However, our models show that this
continuum flux is not a unique indicator of disk mass and it should therefore
be used jointly with complementary observational data for optimal results. The
presence of an anti-correlation between MIR H2O blend fluxes and the MIR SED is
consistent with a scenario where dust evolves in disks, producing lower opacity
and stronger features in the Spitzer spectral regime, while the gas eventually
becomes depleted at a later stage, leaving behind an inner cavity in the disk.

begins locally and elongates, or spreads, in the direction perpendicular to the

theory of three-dimensional (3D) spreading of collisionless anti-parallel
reconnection in a current sheet with its thickness varying in the out-of-plane
direction, both for spreading from a thinner to thicker region and a thicker to
thinner region. We derive an expression for calculating the time it takes for
spreading to occur for a current sheet with a given profile of its thickness. A
key result is that when reconnection spreads from a thinner to a thicker
region, the spreading speed in the thicker region is slower than both the
Alfv\'en speed and the speed of the local current carriers by a factor of the
ratio of thin to thick current sheet thicknesses. This is important because
magnetospheric and solar observations have previously measured the spreading
speed to be slower than previously predicted, so the present mechanism might
explain this feature. We confirm the theory via a parametric study using 3D
two-fluid numerical simulations. We use the prediction to calculate the time
scale for reconnection spreading in Earth's magnetotail during geomagnetic
activity. The results are also potentially important for understanding

followed by generating a cross-kernel discovery tensor for disease prediction.

real world is yet to come. One crucial stepping stone is to devise RL
algorithms that are robust in the face of dropped information from corrupted
communication or malfunctioning sensors. Typical RL methods usually require
considerable online interaction data that are costly and unsafe to collect in
the real world. Furthermore, when applying to the frame dropping scenarios,
they perform unsatisfactorily even with moderate drop rates. To address these
issues, we propose Decision Transformer under Random Frame Dropping~(DeFog), an
offline RL algorithm that enables agents to act robustly in frame dropping
scenarios without online interaction. DeFog first randomly masks out data in
the offline datasets and explicitly adds the time span of frame dropping as
inputs. After that, a finetuning stage on the same offline dataset with a
higher mask rate would further boost the performance. Empirical results show
that DeFog outperforms strong baselines under severe frame drop rates like
90\%, while maintaining similar returns under non-frame-dropping conditions in
the regular MuJoCo control benchmarks and the Atari environments. Our approach
offers a robust and deployable solution for controlling agents in real-world

relativistic motor provided high enough charge and current densities are
available. Since on the macroscopic scale charge density is limited by the
phenomena of dielectric breakdown, it was suggested to take advantage of the
high charge densities which are available on the microscopic scale. A study
into the microscopic scale demonstrated that only certain types of quantum
systems will support a relativistic motor. (2) Methods: We use standard
physical theories such as Maxwell electrodynamics and Quantum mechanics,
supplemented by tools from vector analysis and numerics in order to study the
options of free and confined electrons (3) Results: We show that a hydrogen
atom either in the ground state or excited state will not produce a
relativistic engine effect, but by breaking the symmetry or putting the
electron in a wave packet state may produce relativistic motor effect. (4)
Conclusions: A highly localized wave packet will produce a strong relativistic
motor effect. The preliminary analysis of the current paper suggests new

very close. We use one single skew-normal distribution (SND) model to fit
waveforms of all spectral channels first and count the geometric center

multi-targets. The geometric center position distribution of the
""Pseudo-monopulse"" presents aggregation and asymmetry with the change of
wavelength, while such an asymmetric phenomenon cannot be found from the echoes
of the single target. Both theoretical and experimental data verify the point.
Based on such observation, we further propose a hyperspectral waveform

waveform component parameters and their ranges based on the distinction of the
three characteristics (geometric center position, pulse width, and
skew-coefficient) between the echo and fitted SND waveform and 2) conducting
single-channel waveform decomposition for all channels and 3) setting
thresholds to find outlier channels based on statistical parameters of all
single-channel decomposition results (the standard deviation and the means of
geometric center position) and 4) re-conducting single-channel waveform
decomposition for these outlier channels. The proposed method significantly

function. For the computation of this function in practical applications, it is
important to develop not only accurate but also a simple approximation that
requires evaluation of the fewest possible terms. To that end, introducing
Ramanujan's series expression, this work proposes a full-range approximation to
the exponential integral using Ramanujan's series for the small argument (u
\leq 1) and an approximation based on the bound of the integral for the other
range (u \in (1,100]). The evaluation of the proposed approximation results in
the most accurate formulae compared to the existing studies, which possess the
maximum percentage error of 0.05\%. Further, the proposed formula is much
simpler to apply as it contains just the product of exponential and logarithm
functions. To further check the efficiency of the proposed approximation, we
consider a practical example for evaluating the discrete pumping kernel, which
shows the superiority of this approximation over the others. Finally, the

  Mistakes of New Generation Search Engines",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although large conversational AI models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT have
demonstrated great potential, we question whether such models can guarantee
factual accuracy. Recently, technology companies such as Microsoft and Google
have announced new services which aim to combine search engines with
conversational AI. However, we have found numerous mistakes in the public
demonstrations that suggest we should not easily trust the factual claims of
the AI models. Rather than criticizing specific models or companies, we hope to
call on researchers and developers to improve AI models' transparency and
factual correctness.

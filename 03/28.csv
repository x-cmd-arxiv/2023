large-amplitude oscillations (LAOs) in prominences. However, the mechanisms for
LAOs excitation are not well understood. We aim to study these mechanisms,
performing time-dependent numerical simulations in 2.5D and 2D setups using
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code MANCHA3D. Two types of disturbances are applied
to excite prominence oscillations, such as a perturbation associated with an
eruption and the waves caused by an artificial energy release. In the
simulation with the eruption, we obtain that it does not produce LAOs in the
prominence located in its vicinity. While the erupting flux rope rises, an
elongated current sheet forms behind it, which becomes unstable and breaks into
plasmoids. The downward-moving plasmoids cause perturbations in the velocity
field by merging with the post-reconnection loops. This velocity perturbation
propagates in the surroundings and perturbs the nearby prominence. The analysis
of the oscillatory motions of the prominence plasma reveals the excitation of
small-amplitude oscillations (SAOs), which are a mixture of longitudinal and
vertical oscillations. In the simulation with a distant artificial
perturbation, a fast-mode shock wave is produced, and it gradually reaches two
flux rope prominences at different distances. This shock wave excites vertical
LAOs and longitudinal SAOs with similar amplitudes, periods, and damping times
in both prominences. Finally, in the experiment with the external triggering of
LAOs in a dipped arcade prominence model, we find that, although the vector
normal to the front of a fast-mode shock wave is parallel to the spine of the
dipped arcade well before the contact, this wave does not excite longitudinal
LAOs. When the wave front approaches the prominence, it pushes the dense plasma
down, establishing vertical LAOs.

conditional distributions with multiple modes. However, despite their
potential, these models are challenging to train and often tend to produce poor
performance, explaining their limited popularity. Our hypothesis is that this
under-performance is a result of the commonly utilized maximum likelihood (ML)
optimization, which leads to mode averaging and a higher likelihood of getting
stuck in local maxima. We propose a novel curriculum-based approach to learning
mixture models in which each component of the MoE is able to select its own
subset of the training data for learning. This approach allows for independent
optimization of each component, resulting in a more modular architecture that
enables the addition and deletion of components on the fly, leading to an
optimization less susceptible to local optima. The curricula can ignore
data-points from modes not represented by the MoE, reducing the mode-averaging
problem. To achieve a good data coverage, we couple the optimization of the
curricula with a joint entropy objective and optimize a lower bound of this
objective. We evaluate our curriculum-based approach on a variety of multimodal
behavior learning tasks and demonstrate its superiority over competing methods
for learning MoE models and conditional generative models.

the locus of magnetic energy transfer (dissipation) into particle kinetic
energy, leading to heating and/or acceleration of the latter. CoSs and
especially CSs are also evolving and fragmenting, becoming locally the source
of new clusters of CoSs. Strong turbulence can be generated by the nonlinear
coupling of large amplitude unstable plasma modes, by the explosive
reorganization of large scale magnetic fields, or by the fragmentation of CoSs.
A small fraction of CSs inside a strongly turbulent plasma will end up
reconnecting. Magnetic Reconnection (MR) is one of the potential forms of
energy dissipation of a turbulent plasma. Analysing the evolution of CSs and MR
in isolation from the surrounding CoSs and plasma flows may be convenient for
2D numerical studies, but it is far from a realistic modeling of 3D

they tend to be less reliable when applied at new hospitals. This makes it
difficult to deploy them at scale. Using carefully harmonised intensive care
data from four data sources across Europe and the US (totalling 334,812 stays),
we systematically assessed the reliability of DL models for three common
adverse events: death, acute kidney injury (AKI), and sepsis. We tested whether
using more than one data source and/or explicitly optimising for
generalisability during training improves model performance at new hospitals.
We found that models achieved high AUROC for mortality (0.838-0.869), AKI

performance dropped at new hospitals, sometimes by as much as -0.200. Using

multi-source models performing roughly on par with the best single-source

impossible, task. However, estimating the causal structure is possible under
certain assumptions on the data-generating process. Many commonly used methods
rely on the additivity of the noise in the structural equation models.
Additivity implies that the variance or the tail of the effect, given the
causes, is invariant; the cause only affects the mean. However, the tail or
other characteristics of the random variable can provide different information
about the causal structure. Such cases have received only very little attention
in the literature.
  It has been shown that the causal graph is identifiable under different
models, such as linear non-Gaussian, post-nonlinear, or quadratic variance
functional models. We introduce a new class of models called the Conditional
Parametric Causal Models (CPCM), where the cause affects the effect in some of
the characteristics of interest. We use sufficient statistics to show the
identifiability of the CPCM models in the exponential family of conditional
distributions. We also propose an algorithm for estimating the causal structure
from a random sample under CPCM. Its empirical properties are studied for
various data sets, including an application on the expenditure behavior of
residents of the Philippines.

where object detectors are adapted from a label-rich source domain to an

based domain alignment where the adversarial training between the feature
extractor and domain discriminator results in domain-invariance in the feature
space. However, due to the domain shift, domain discrimination, especially on
low-level features, is an easy task. This results in an imbalance of the
adversarial training between the domain discriminator and the feature

propose Adversarial Image Reconstruction (AIR) as the regularizer to facilitate
the adversarial training of the feature extractor. We further design a

gravity) by the introduction of a complex, the differential of which provides
the linearised dynamics. The main point is the natural replacement of the
two-derivative equations of motion by a differential which only contains terms
of order 0 and 1 in derivatives. Second derivatives arise from homotopy
transfer (elimination of fields with algebraic equations of motion). The
formalism has the advantage of providing a clear consistency relation for the
algebraic part of the differential, the ""dualisation"", which then defines the
dynamics of physical fields. It remains unmodified in the interacting BV
theory, and the full non-linear models arise from covariantisation. A
consequence of the use of the complex is that symmetry under local rotations
becomes as good as manifest, instead of arising for a specific combination of
tensorial terms, for less obvious reasons. We illustrate with a derivation of
teleparallel Ehlers geometry, where the extended coordinate module is the
adjoint module of a finite-dimensional simple Lie group.

action and stress tensor of the anomaly can be expressed in a local quadratic
form by the introduction of a scalar conformalon field which satisfies a linear
wave equation. A wide class of non-vacuum initial state conditions is generated
by different solutions of this equation. An interesting subclass of solutions
corresponds to initial states that give rise to an arbitrarily large
semi-classical stress tensor on the future horizon of the black hole formed in
classical collapse. These lead to modification and suppression of Hawking
radiation at late times after the collapse, and potentially large backreaction
effects on the horizon scale due to the conformal anomaly. The probability of
non-vacuum initial conditions large enough to produce these effects is
estimated from the Gaussian vacuum wave functional in the Schrodinger
representation and shown to be of order 1. These results indicate that quantum
effects of the conformal anomaly in non-vacuum states are relevant for
gravitational collapse in the effective theory of gravity in four dimensions as

design engaging, playful experiences that draws players in for hours and causes
them to lose their sense of time. While these designs can provide enjoyable
experiences, many individuals -- especially children -- may find it challenging
to regulate their playing time, and often they struggle to turn off the game.
In turn, this affords external regulation of children's playing behavior by
limiting playing time or encouraging alternative activities, which frequently
leads to conflicts between parents and the children. Here, we see an
opportunity for game design to address player disengagement through design,
facilitating a timely and autonomous exit from play. Hence, while most research
and practitioners design for maximizing player engagement, we argue for a
perspective shift towards disengagement as a design tool that allows for
unobtrusive and smooth exits from the game. We advocate that interweaving
disengagement into the game design could reduce friction within families,
allowing children to finish game sessions more easily, facilitate a sense of
autonomy, and support an overall healthier relationship with games. In this
position paper, we outline a research agenda that examines how game design can
address player disengagement, what challenges exist in the specific context of
games for children, and how such approaches can be reconciled with the
experiential, artistic, and commercial goals of games.

The evidence for nonzero cosmic curvature is lesser in dynamical dark energy
models compared to the $\Lambda$CDM model. That means the evidence of nonzero
cosmic curvature depends on the behavior of the equation of state of the dark
energy. Since the values of the cosmic curvature are degenerate to the equation
of state of the dark energy, we also consider a model independent analysis to
constrain the cosmic curvature using the combination of Gaussian process
regression analysis and artificial neural networks analysis. In the model
independent analysis, we also find evidence for a closed Universe, and the flat

introduce a principled way to inject content of one image to another

original generative process, 1) the feature of the source content should be
gradually blended, 2) the blended feature should be normalized to preserve the

be calibrated. Then, the resulting image has the source content with the style

injecting contents to styles of unseen domains produces harmonization-like

that each community presumably gathers nodes sharing a common mission, purpose

connectivity density of the interior and the boundary of a community. Indeed,
nodes sharing a common purpose or property are expected to interact closely.
Although this rule appears mostly relevant, some fundamental scientific
problems like disease module detection highlight the inability to determine
significantly the communities under this connectivity rule. The main reason is
that the connectivity density is not correlated to a shared property or
purpose. Therefore, another paradigm is required for properly formalize this
issue in order to meaningfully detect these communities. In this article we
study the community formation from this new principle. Considering colors

$n^{(\log n + O(1))}$ running time, attributed to Tarjan, was proposed in the
1970s [Mil78]. Despite the extensive study over the past decades, the current
best group isomorphism algorithm has an $n^{(1 / 4 + o(1))\log n}$ running time
[Ros13].
  The isomorphism testing for $p$-groups of (nilpotent) class 2 and exponent
$p$ has been identified as a major barrier to obtaining an $n^{o(\log n)}$ time
algorithm for the group isomorphism problem. Although the $p$-groups of class 2
and exponent $p$ have much simpler algebraic structures than general groups,
the best-known isomorphism testing algorithm for this group class also has an
$n^{O(\log n)}$ running time.
  In this paper, we present an isomorphism testing algorithm for $p$-groups of
class 2 and exponent $p$ with running time $n^{O((\log n)^{5/6})}$ for any
prime $p > 2$. Our result is based on a novel reduction to the skew-symmetric
matrix tuple isometry problem [IQ19]. To obtain the reduction, we develop
several tools for matrix space analysis, including a matrix space
individualization-refinement method and a characterization of the low rank
matrix spaces.

optimization process. Our second approach, called prompt debiasing, identifies
conflicting words between user prompts and view prompts utilizing a language

graph matching method to address these issues. Especially, we model the
intra-view relationships as an undirected graph. Then data association turns
into a general graph matching problem between graphs. Furthermore, to make
optimization end-to-end differentiable, we relax the original graph matching
problem into continuous quadratic programming and then incorporate training

for exoplanet atmospheres, although it presents unique challenges which
translate into characterization bottlenecks when robust mitigation strategies
are missing. Stellar contamination is one of such challenges that can overpower
the planetary signal by up to an order of magnitude, and thus not accounting
for stellar contamination can lead to significant biases in the derived
atmospheric properties. Yet, accounting for stellar contamination may not be
straightforward, as important discrepancies exist between state-of-the-art
stellar models and measured spectra and between models themselves. Here we
explore the extent to which stellar models can be used to reliably correct for
stellar contamination and yield a planet's uncontaminated transmission
spectrum. We find that (1) discrepancies between stellar models can dominate
the noise budget of JWST transmission spectra of planets around stars with
heterogeneous photospheres; (2) the true number of unique photospheric spectral
components and their properties can only be accurately retrieved when the
stellar models have a sufficient fidelity; and (3) under such optimistic
circumstances the contribution of stellar contamination to the noise budget of
a transmission spectrum is considerably below that of the photon noise for the
standard transit observation setup. Therefore, we suggest (1) increased efforts
towards development of model spectra of stars and their active regions in a
data-driven manner; and (2) the development of empirical approaches for
deriving spectra of photospheric components using the observatories with which
the atmospheric explorations are carried out.

the latter sets the typical driving frequency for the onset of non-geometric

illuminated the transition from the cosmic ""dark ages"" to the reionization of
the intergalactic medium. This transitional period has been largely
inaccessible to direct observation until the recent commissioning of JWST,
which has extended our observational reach into that epoch. Excitingly, the
first JWST science observations uncovered a surprisingly high abundance of
early star-forming galaxies. However, the distances (redshifts) of these
galaxies were, by necessity, estimated from multi-band photometry. Photometric
redshifts, while generally robust, can suffer from uncertainties and/or
degeneracies. Spectroscopic measurements of the precise redshifts are required
to validate these sources and to reliably quantify their space densities,
stellar masses, and star formation rates, which provide powerful constraints on
galaxy formation models and cosmology. Here we present the results of JWST
follow-up spectroscopy of a small sample of galaxies suspected to be amongst
the most distant yet observed. We confirm redshifts z > 10 for two galaxies,
including one of the first bright JWST-discovered candidates with z = 11.4, and
show that another galaxy with suggested z ~ 16 instead has z = 4.9, with strong
emission lines that mimic the expected colors of more distant objects. These
results reinforce the evidence for the rapid production of luminous galaxies in

However, several recent experiments have detected signatures of bulk
metallicity within this Kondo insulating phase. Here we visualize the
real-space charge landscape within a Kondo lattice with atomic resolution using
a scanning tunneling microscope. We discover nanometer-scale puddles of
metallic conduction electrons centered around uranium-site substitutions in the
heavy-fermion compound URu$_2$Si$_2$, and around samarium-site defects in the
topological Kondo insulator SmB$_6$. These defects disturb the Kondo screening
cloud, leaving behind a fingerprint of the metallic parent state. Our results
suggest that the mysterious 3D quantum oscillations measured in SmB$_6$ could
arise from these Kondo-lattice defects, although we cannot rule out other
explanations. Our imaging technique could enable the development of
atomic-scale charge sensors using heavy-fermion probes.

gravitationally lensed supernovae within the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)

unknown lenses, we test multiple methods suggested in the literature for the

colours, those that appear inconsistent with the host galaxy redshift, and
those with bright absolute magnitudes inferred from the host galaxy redshift.
We find a few hundred candidates, most of which are due to contamination from
activate galactic nuclei, bogus detections, or unlensed supernovae. The false
positive rate from these methods presents significant challenges for future
surveys. In total, 132 unique transients were identified across all of our

must be explicable to ensure confidence in their reliability and fairness. A
common approach to evaluate deep learning models is to build a labeled test set
with attributes of interest and assess how well it performs. However, creating
a balanced test set (i.e., one that is uniformly sampled over all the important
traits) is often time-consuming, expensive, and prone to mistakes. The question
we try to address is: can we evaluate the sensitivity of deep learning models
to arbitrary visual attributes without an annotated test set? This paper argues
the case that Zero-shot Model Diagnosis (ZOOM) is possible without the need for
a test set nor labeling. To avoid the need for test sets, our system relies on
a generative model and CLIP. The key idea is enabling the user to select a set
of prompts (relevant to the problem) and our system will automatically search
for semantic counterfactual images (i.e., synthesized images that flip the
prediction in the case of a binary classifier) using the generative model. We
evaluate several visual tasks (classification, key-point detection, and

PTA data sets and the need to understand present and future PTA capabilities to
characterize the SGWB through large-scale simulations, we have developed
efficient and rapid approaches that operate on intermediate SGWB analysis
products. These methods refit SGWB spectral models to previously-computed
Bayesian posterior estimations of the timing power spectra. We test our new
methods on simulated PTA data sets and the NANOGrav $12.5$-year data set, where
in the latter our refit posterior achieves a Hellinger distance from the
current full production-level pipeline that is $\lesssim 0.1$. Our methods are
$\sim10^2$--$10^4$ times faster than the production-level likelihood and scale
sub-linearly as a PTA is expanded with new pulsars or observations. Our methods
also demonstrate that SGWB spectral characterization in PTA data sets is driven
by the longest-timed pulsars with the best-measured power spectral densities
which is not necessarily the case for SGWB detection that is predicated on
correlating many pulsars. Indeed, the common-process spectral properties found
in the NANOGrav $12.5$-year data set are given by analyzing only the $\sim10$
longest-timed pulsars out of the full $45$ pulsar array, and we find that the
``shallowing'' of the common-process power-law model occurs when
gravitational-wave frequencies higher than $\sim 50$~nanohertz are included.
The implementation of our methods is openly available as a software suite to

scattering on such a rough guide surface with a mean-square roughness larger
than 5 nm. We therefore developed a scattering model for UCN in which
scattering from random surface waviness with a size larger than the UCN
wavelength is described by a microfacet Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution
Function model (mf-BRDF model), and scattering from smaller structures by the
Lambert's cosine law (Lambert model). For the surface waviness, we used the
statistical distribution of surface slope measured by an atomic force
microscope on a sample piece of guide tube as input of the model. This model
was used to describe UCN transmission experiments conducted at the pulsed UCN
source at J-PARC. In these experiments, a UCN beam collimated to a divergence
angle smaller than $\pm 6^{\circ}$ was directed into a guide tube with a
mean-square roughness of 6.4 nm to 17 nm at an oblique angle, and the UCN
transport performance and its time-of-flight distribution were measured while
changing the angle of incidence. The mf-BRDF model combined with the Lambert

the MOCK-X pipeline. The scaling between $L_{\mathrm{X, 500}}$ and the total
mass within 5 effective radii ($M_{5R_{\rm e}}$) agrees well with observed ETGs
from Chandra. IllustrisTNG reproduces the observed increase in scatter of
$L_{\mathrm{X, 500}}$ towards lower masses, and we find that ETGs with
$\log_{10} (M_{5R_{\rm e}}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}) \leqslant 11.5$ with
above-average $L_{\mathrm{X, 500}}$ experienced systematically lower cumulative
kinetic AGN feedback energy historically (vice versa for below-average ETGs).
This leads to larger gas mass fractions and younger stellar populations with
stronger stellar feedback heating, concertedly resulting in the above-average
$L_{\mathrm{X, 500}}$. The $L_{\mathrm{X, 500}}$--$T_{\mathrm{sl, 500}}$
relation shows a similar slope to the observed ETGs but the simulation
systematically underestimates the gas temperature. Three outliers that lie far
below the $L_{\rm X}$--$T_{\rm sl}$ relation all interacted with larger galaxy
clusters recently and demonstrate clear features of environmental heating. We
propose that the distinct location of these backsplash ETGs in the $L_{\rm

existence of massive, starless cores within molecular clouds. Yet, only a small
number of candidates for such truly massive, monolithic cores are currently
known. Aims: Here we analyse a massive core in the well-studied infrared-dark
cloud (IRDC) called the 'dragon cloud' (also known as G028.37+00.07 or 'Cloud
C'). This core (C2c1) sits at the end of a chain of a roughly equally spaced
actively star-forming cores near the centre of the IRDC. Methods: We present
new high-angular resolution 1 mm ALMA dust continuum and molecular line
observations of the massive core. Results: The high-angular resolution
observations show that this region fragments into two cores C2c1a and C2c1b,
which retain significant background-subtracted masses of 23 Msun and 2 Msun (31
Msun and 6 Msun without background subtraction), respectively. The cores do not
appear to fragment further on the scales of our highest angular resolution
images (0.200 arcsec, 0.005 pc ~ 1000 AU). We find that these cores are very
dense (nH2 > 10^6 cm-3) and have only trans-sonic non-thermal motions (Ms ~ 1).
Together the mass, density and internal motions imply a virial parameter of <
1, which suggests the cores are gravitationally unstable, unless supported by
strong magnetic fields with strengths of ~ 1 - 10 mG. From CO line
observations, we find that there is tentative evidence for a weak molecular
outflow towards the lower-mass core, and yet the more massive core remains
devoid of any star formation indicators. Conclusions: We present evidence for
the existence of a massive, pre-stellar core, which has implications for
theories of massive star formation. This source warrants follow-up
higher-angular-resolution observations to further assess its monolithic and
pre-stellar nature.

clusters, the ram pressure of the ICM can strip the gas from galaxies. The
stripped gas forms tails on the trailing side. These galaxies are hence dubbed
``jellyfish galaxies''. ESO 137-001 is a quintessential jellyfish galaxy
located in the nearest rich cluster, the Norma cluster. Its spectacular
multiphase tail has complex morphology and kinematics both from the imprinted
galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM) and as a result of the interactions between
the stripped gas and the surrounding hot plasma, mediated by radiative cooling
and magnetic fields. We study the kinematics of the multiphase tail using
high-resolution observations of the ionized and the molecular gas in the entire
structure. We calculate the velocity structure functions (VSFs) in moving
frames along the tail and find that turbulence driven by Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)
instability quickly overwhelms the original ISM turbulence and saturates at
$\sim 30$ kpc. There is also a hint that the far end of the tail has possibly
started to inherit pre-existing large-scale ICM turbulence likely caused by
structure formation. Turbulence measured by the molecular gas is generally
consistent with that measured by the ionized gas in the tail but has a slightly
lower amplitude. Most of the measured turbulence is below the mean free path of
the hot ICM ($\sim 11$ kpc). Using warm/cool gas as a tracer of the hot ICM, we
find that the isotropic viscosity of the hot plasma must be suppressed below
0.01 percent Spitzer level.

all its components are physically consistent in the 6D phase-space (position,
parallax, and 3D motion), homogeneous in age (14 $-$ 44 Myr), and chemical
content (half-solar metallicity). In addition, the system's global stellar
density distribution is that of typical star clusters and shows clear evidence
of mass segregation. We find that the hierarchical structure is mostly
contracting towards the center with a speed of up to $\simeq4-5$ km s$^{-1}$,
while the innermost regions expand at a lower rate (about $\simeq1$ km
s$^{-1}$) and are dominated by random motions. Interestingly, this pattern is
dominated by the kinematics of massive stars, while low-mass stars ($M<2$
M$_\odot$) are characterized by contraction across the entire cluster. Finally,
the nine star clusters in the system are all characterized by a relatively flat
velocity dispersion profile possibly resulting from ongoing interactions and
tidal heating. We show that the observational results are generally consistent
with those found in $N$-body simulations following the cluster violent
relaxation phase strongly suggesting that the system is a massive cluster in
the early assembly stages. This is the second structure with these properties
identified in our Galaxy and, following the nomenclature of our previous work,
we named it LISCA II.

for these simulations are generated from simulations of the observed Wolf-Rayet
stellar winds in the Galactic Centre. The resulting flow tends to be highly
magnetized ($\beta \approx 2$) with an $\sim$ $r^{-1}$ density profile
independent of the strength of magnetic fields in the winds. Our simulations
reach the MAD state for some, but not all cases. In tilted flows, SANE jets
tend to align with the angular momentum of the gas at large scales, even if
that direction is perpendicular to the black hole spin axis. Conversely, MAD
jets tend to align with the black hole spin axis. The gas angular momentum
shows similar behavior: SANE flows tend to only partially align while MAD flows
tend to fully align. With a limited number of dynamical free parameters, our
models can produce accretion rates, 230 GHz flux, and unresolved linear
polarization fractions roughly consistent with observations for several choices
of electron heating fraction. Absent another source of large-scale magnetic
field, winds with a higher degree of magnetization (e.g., where the magnetic
pressure is 1/100 of the ram pressure in the winds) may be required to get a
sufficiently large RM with consistent sign.

includes the quantum geometric effects in flat-band superconductors. First of
all, we deduce the critical temperature of a flat-band superconductor within
the mean-field description which is determined by the quantum metric. Secondly,
going beyond the mean-field approximation by taking into account the
fluctuations of the order parameter, we determine the superfluid weight,
superconducting coherent length, and the upper critical field and their
dependence on the quantum metric of the flat bands. Thirdly, we apply the GL to
twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). By calculating the quantum metric of flat bands
of TBG, the GL theory allows the estimation of the superconducting coherence
length and the upper critical field. The results of the superconducting
coherence length and upper critical field match the experimental results
incredibly well without the fine tuning of parameters. The GL theory with

imaging observations of a complete sample of 48 optically-selected type 2
quasars $-$ the QSOFEED sample (L$_{\rm [OIII]}>$10$^{8.5}$$L_{\odot}$; $z <

that galaxy interactions are the dominant triggering mechanism for quasar
activity in the local universe, with 65$^{+6}_{-7}$ per cent of the type 2
quasar hosts showing morphological features consistent with galaxy mergers or
encounters, compared with only 22$^{+5}_{-4}$ per cent of a stellar-mass- and
redshift-matched comparison sample of non-AGN galaxies $-$ a 5$\sigma$

become visible post-coalescence, the majority of morphologically-disturbed type

in which a pair of caustic points either nucleate or annihilate, provide a
mechanism for creases to decay. We argue that properties of quantum
entanglement entropy suggest that creases might contribute to black hole
entropy. We explain that a ""Gauss-Bonnet"" term in the entropy is
non-topological on a non-smooth horizon, which invalidates previous arguments
against such a term.

evolution, leading to an observed correlation between SMBH mass $M_{\rm BH}$
and host galaxy velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\rm e}$. Outside the local
Universe, measurements of $M_{\rm BH}$ are usually only possible for SMBHs in
an active state: limiting sample size and introducing selection biases.
Gravitational lensing makes it possible to measure the mass of non-active
SMBHs. We present models of the $z=0.169$ galaxy-scale strong lens Abell~1201.
A cD galaxy in a galaxy cluster, it has sufficient `external shear' that a
magnified image of a $z = 0.451$ background galaxy is projected just $\sim 1$
kpc from the galaxy centre. Using multi-band Hubble Space Telescope imaging and
the lens modeling software $\texttt{PyAutoLens}$ we reconstruct the
distribution of mass along this line of sight. Bayesian model comparison
favours a point mass with $M_{\rm BH} = 3.27 \pm 2.12\times10^{10}\,$M$_{\rm
\odot}$ (3$\sigma$ confidence limit); an ultramassive black hole. One model
gives a comparable Bayesian evidence without a SMBH, however we argue this
model is nonphysical given its base assumptions. This model still provides an
upper limit of $M_{\rm BH} \leq 5.3 \times 10^{10}\,$M$_{\rm \odot}$, because a
SMBH above this mass deforms the lensed image $\sim 1$ kpc from Abell 1201's
centre. This builds on previous work using central images to place upper limits
on $M_{\rm BH}$, but is the first to also place a lower limit and without a
central image being observed. The success of this method suggests that surveys
during the next decade could measure thousands more SMBH masses, and any
redshift evolution of the $M_{\rm BH}$--$\sigma_{\rm e}$ relation. Results are

binary black hole (BBH) mergers in the Universe. Here, we quantify the main
sources of uncertainty for the merger rate density evolution and mass spectrum
of Pop. III BBHs by considering four different formation histories of Pop. III
stars and 11 models of the initial orbital properties of their binary systems.
The uncertainty on the orbital properties affects the BBH merger rate density
by up to two orders of magnitude; models with shorter initial orbital periods
lead to higher BBH merger rates, because they favour the merger via stable mass
transfer episodes. The uncertainty on the star formation history also has a
substantial impact on both the shape and the normalisation of the BBH merger
rate density: the peak of the merger rate density shifts from $z\sim{8}$ up to
$z\sim{16}$ depending on the assumed star formation rate, while the maximum BBH
merger rate density for our fiducial binary population model spans from
$\sim{2}$ to $\sim{30}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. The typical BBH masses are not
affected by the star formation rate model and only mildly influenced by the
binary population parameters. The primary black holes born from Pop. III stars
tend to be rather massive ($30-40$ M$_\odot$) with respect to those born from
metal-rich stars ($8-10$ M$_\odot$). However, we expect that Pop. III BBH
mergers with primary mass $m_1>60$ M$_\odot$ are rare ($<10^{-2}$ Gpc$^{-3}$
yr$^{-1}$). Finally, we estimate that the Einstein Telescope will detect
$10-10^4$ Pop. III BBH mergers per year, depending on the star formation
history and binary star properties.

intense centimeter radio flares in Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) and by rare
findings of strong millimeter-wavelength variability, we have conducted a
systematic search for such variability in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) using
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Rapid variability on
timescales of minutes to hours in the (centimeter)millimeter-wavelength range
indicates (gyro)synchrotron radiation. Additionally, mass accretion will also
affect the millimeter-wavelength luminosity but typically on longer timescales.
Beyond studies of individual YSOs, our characterization of strong
millimeter-wavelength variability with ALMA in the ONC sets first systematic
constraints on the occurrence of such variability in a large number of YSOs
($\sim$130). We report the discovery of an order of magnitude millimeter-flare
within just a few minutes from a known YSO previously reported as a radio
flaring source at cm-wavelengths (the ""ORBS'' source). We also present an
assessment of the systematic variability effects caused by the use of
time-sliced imaging of a complex region. These are mostly due to the impact of
a changing synthesized beam throughout the observations. We use simulated ALMA
observations to reproduce and quantify these effects and set a lower limit for
the variability that can be studied using our method in a complex region such
as the ONC. Our results demonstrate that the utility of time domain analysis of
YSOs extends into the millimeter-wavelength range, potentially interfering with
the conversion of observed fluxes into dust masses.

10.5) into cluster (log Mhalo/Msolar >= 13) and field (log Mhalo/Msolar < 13)
galaxies at z = 2 and further divide into centrals and satellites. We track
their gas inflow rates from z = 6 to 2 and find that the total gas inflow rates
of satellite galaxies rapidly decline after their infall into cluster halos and
as they reach the cluster center. At z = 2, the gas inflow rate of cluster
satellite galaxies is correlated with the cluster-centric radii and not the
host halo mass. In contrast, the gas inflow rate in centrals is strongly
correlated with the host halo mass at z >= 2. Our study indicates that between
redshifts 6 to 2, the gas that normally is accreted by the satellite galaxies
is redirected to the center of the cluster halo as inflows to the cluster
centrals and forming the intra-cluster medium. Our analysis suggest that the
inequality of gas accretion between massive satellite and central galaxies is
responsible for the starvation of cluster satellite galaxies that evolve into
the massive quenched cluster galaxies observed at z<0.5.

Recognizing that this can be prohibitive for certain systems, we develop the
method of transition tube sampling that mitigates the computational cost of
training set and model generation. In this approach, we generate classical or
quantum thermal geometries around a transition path describing a conformational
change or a chemical reaction using only a sparse set of local normal mode
expansions along this path and select from these geometries by an active
learning protocol. This yields a training set with geometries that characterize
the whole transition without the need for a costly reference trajectory. The
performance of the method is evaluated on different molecular systems with the
complexity of the potential energy landscape increasing from a single minimum
to a double proton-transfer reaction with high barriers. Our results show that
the method leads to training sets that give rise to models applicable in
classical and path integral simulations alike that are on par with those based
directly on ab initio calculations while providing the computational speed-up

the extragalactic sky. The spectroscopic channel of the Near-Infrared
Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP) has a resolution of $R\sim450$ for its blue
and red grisms that collectively cover the $0.93$--$1.89 $\micron;range. NISP
will obtain spectroscopic redshifts for $3\times10^7$ galaxies for the
experiments on galaxy clustering, baryonic acoustic oscillations, and redshift
space distortion. The wavelength calibration must be accurate within $5$\AA to
avoid systematics in the redshifts and downstream cosmological parameters. The
NISP pre-flight dispersion laws for the grisms were obtained on the ground
using a Fabry-Perot etalon. Launch vibrations, zero gravity conditions, and
thermal stabilisation may alter these dispersion laws, requiring an in-flight
recalibration. To this end, we use the emission lines in the spectra of compact
planetary nebulae (PNe), which were selected from a PN data base. To ensure
completeness of the PN sample, we developed a novel technique to identify
compact and strong line emitters in Gaia spectroscopic data using the Gaia
spectra shape coefficients. We obtained VLT/X-SHOOTER spectra from $0.3$ to
$2.5$ \micron;for 19 PNe in excellent seeing conditions and a wide slit,
mimicking Euclid's slitless spectroscopy mode but with 10 times higher spectral
resolution. Additional observations of one northern PN were obtained in the
$0.80$--$1.90$ \micron range with the GMOS and GNIRS instruments at the Gemini
North observatory. The collected spectra were combined into an atlas of
heliocentric vacuum wavelengths with a joint statistical and systematic
accuracy of 0.1 \AA in the optical and 0.3 \AA in the near-infrared. The
wavelength atlas and the related 1D and 2D spectra are made publicly available.

neutron scattering on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. We observe that the long-range zigzag
magnetic ordered state only survives when the doping concentration is smaller
than 5\%. Upon further increasing the spin vacancy concentration, the ground
state becomes a short-range ordered state at low temperatures. Compared with
experiments, our classical solution over-stabilizes the zigzag correlation in
the presence of spin vacancies. Our theoretical results provide guidance toward
interpreting inelastic neutron scattering experiments on magnetically diluted

addition, such methods also require large datasets with short-exposure and
corresponding long-exposure ground truth raw images for each camera domain,
which is tedious to compile. To address this issue, we present a novel few-shot
domain adaptation method to utilize the existing source camera labeled data
with few labeled samples from the target camera to improve the target domain's
enhancement quality in extreme low-light imaging. Our experiments show that
only ten or fewer labeled samples from the target camera domain are sufficient
to achieve similar or better enhancement performance than training a model with
a large labeled target camera dataset. To support research in this direction,
we also present a new low-light raw image dataset captured with a Nikon camera,

$H$ and a hypercube $Q_n$, $ex(Q_n, H)$ is the largest number of edges in an
$H$-free subgraph of $Q_n$. If $ex(Q_n, H)$ is equal to a positive proportion
of the number of edges in $Q_n$, $H$ is said to have positive Tur\'an density
in a hypercube; otherwise it has zero Tur\'an density. Determining $ex(Q_n, H)$
and even identifying whether $H$ has positive or zero Tur\'an density remains a
widely open question for general $H$.
  In this paper we focus on layered graphs, i.e., graphs that are contained in
an edge-layer of some hypercube. Graphs $H$ that are not layered have positive
Tur\'an density because one can form an $H$-free subgraph of $Q_n$ consisting
of edges of every other layer. For example, a $4$-cycle is not layered and has
positive Tur\'an density.
  However, in general it is not obvious what properties layered graphs have. We
give a characterisation of layered graphs in terms of edge-colorings and show
that any $n$-vertex layered graphs has at most $\frac{1}{4}n \log n (1+o(1))$
edges. We show that most non-trivial subdivisions have zero Tur\'an density,
extending known results on zero Tur\'an density of even cycles of length at
least $12$ and of length $8$. However, we prove that there are cubical graphs
of girth $8$ that are not layered and thus having positive Tur\'an density. The
cycle of length $10$ remains the only cycle for which it is not known whether
its Tur\'an density is positive or not. We prove that $ex(Q_n, C_{10})=
\Omega(n2^n/ \log^a n)$, for a constant $a$, showing that the extremal number
for a $10$-cycle behaves differently from any other cycle of zero Tur\'an
density.

used as a last resort to prevent cascading outages. The application of the
strategy at the right time is crucial to maintaining system security. A
controlled islanding strategy may be deployed efficiently at the right time by
predicting the time of uncontrolled system splitting. The purpose of this study
is to predict the appropriate islanding time to prevent catastrophic blackout
and uncontrolled islanding based on existing relationships between coherent
generator groups. A new instability index is derived from the proximity of
inter-area oscillations to power splitting indices. Power splitting indices are
derived using synchronization coefficients, which recognize the conditions in
the system that warrant controlled islanding. The critical values of indices
are calculated in offline mode using simulation data from IEEE 39-Buses, and
their online performance is evaluated following a controlled islanding
strategy. Through the introduction of these indices, system degradation can be
effectively evaluated, and blackouts can be predicted early and prevented by
controlled islanding at the right time.

  tides","13 pages, 9 figures. Main result in Figure 7. Submitted to MNRAS,
  comments are welcome!",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A major puzzle concerning the wide stellar binaries (semimajor axes $a\gtrsim
10^3$ AU) in the Solar neighborhood is the origin of their observed
superthermal eccentricity distribution function (DF), which is
well-approximated by $P(e) \propto e^\alpha$ with $\alpha \approx 1.3$. This DF
evolves under the combined influence of (i) tidal torques from the Galactic
disk and (ii) scattering by passing stars, molecular clouds, and substructure.
Recently, Hamilton (2022) (H22) demonstrated that Galactic tides alone cannot
produce a superthermal eccentricity DF from an initially isotropic,
non-superthermal one, under the restrictive assumptions that the eccentricity
DF was initially of power law form and then was rapidly phase-mixed toward a
steady state by the tidal perturbation. In this paper we first prove
analytically that H22's conclusions are in fact valid at all times, regardless
of these assumptions. We then adopt H22's Galactic disk model and numerically
integrate the equations of motion for several ensembles of isotropically
oriented wide binaries to study the time evolution in detail. We find that even
non-power law DFs can be described by an effective power law index
$\alpha_\mathrm{eff}$ which accurately characterizes both their initial and
final states. Any DF with initial (effective or exact) power law index
$\alpha_\mathrm{i}$ is transformed by Galactic tides into another power law
with index $\alpha_\mathrm{f} \approx (1+\alpha_\mathrm{i})/2$ on a timescale
$\sim 2$ Gyr $(a/10^4\mathrm{AU})^{-3/2}$. In a companion paper, we investigate
separately the effect of stellar scattering. As the GAIA data continues to
improve, these results will place strong constraints on wide binary formation
channels.

Especially during polarizing events such as political elections or referendums,
users post information and encourage others to support their side, using
symbols such as hashtags to represent their attitudes. However, many users
choose not to attach hashtags to their messages, use a different language, or
show their position only indirectly. Thus, automatically identifying their
opinions becomes a more challenging task. To uncover these implicit
perspectives, we propose a collaborative filtering model based on Graph
Convolutional Networks that exploits the textual content in messages and the
rich connections between users and topics. Moreover, our approach only requires
a small annotation effort compared to state-of-the-art solutions. Nevertheless,
the proposed model achieves competitive performance in predicting individuals'
stances. We analyze users' attitudes ahead of two constitutional referendums in
Chile in 2020 and 2022. Using two large Twitter datasets, our model achieves
improvements of 3.4% in recall and 3.6% in accuracy over the baselines.

Alternatively, an EA can be made asynchronous parallel. However, EAs using
classic recombination and selection operators (GAs) are known to suffer from an
evaluation time bias, which also influences the performance of the approach.
Model-Based Evolutionary Algorithms (MBEAs) are more scalable than classic GAs
by virtue of capturing the structure of a problem in a model. If this model is
learned through linkage learning based on the population, the learned model may
also capture biases. Thus, if an asynchronous parallel MBEA is also affected by
an evaluation time bias, this could result in learned models to be less suited
to solving the problem, reducing performance. Therefore, in this work, we study
the impact and presence of evaluation time biases on MBEAs in an asynchronous
parallelization setting, and compare this to the biases in GAs. We find that a
modern MBEA, GOMEA, is unaffected by evaluation time biases, while the more
classical MBEA, ECGA, is affected, much like GAs are.

two-center approximation, only one optical K-phonon (~ 160meV) of graphene is
responsible for inter-valley electron-phonon interaction. This phonon has
recently been found in angular-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy to be
responsible for replicas of the TBG flat bands. By projecting the interaction
to the TBG flat bands, we perform the full symmetry analysis of phonon-mediated
attractive interaction and pairing channels in the Chern basis, and show that
several channels are guaranteed to have gapless order parameters. From the
linearized gap equations, we find that the highest Tc pairing induced by this
phonon is a singlet gapped s-wave inter-Chern-band order parameter, followed
closely by a gapless nematic d-wave intra-Chern-band order parameter. We
justify these results analytically, using the topological heavy fermion mapping
of TBG which has allowed us to obtain an analytic form of phonon-mediated
attractive interaction and to analytically solve the linearized and T=0 gap
equations. For the intra-Chern-band channel, the nematic state with nodes is
shown to be stabilized in the chiral flat band limit. While the flat band
Coulomb interaction can be screened sufficiently enough - around Van-Hove
singularities - to allow for electron-phonon based superconductivity, it is
unlikely that this effect can be maintained in the lower density of states
excitation bands around the correlated insulator states.

representations of image content from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has
led to advanced architectures and increased performance for various medical
image analysis tasks due to their complementary benefits. However, compared
with CNNs, transformers require considerably more training data, due to a
larger number of parameters and an absence of inductive bias. The need for
increasingly large datasets continues to be problematic, particularly in the
context of medical imaging, where both annotation efforts and data protection
result in limited data availability. In this work, inspired by the human
decision-making process of correlating new ``evidence'' with previously
memorized ``experience'', we propose a Memorizing Vision Transformer (MoViT) to
alleviate the need for large-scale datasets to successfully train and deploy
transformer-based architectures. MoViT leverages an external memory structure
to cache history attention snapshots during the training stage. To prevent
overfitting, we incorporate an innovative memory update scheme, attention
temporal moving average, to update the stored external memories with the
historical moving average. For inference speedup, we design a prototypical
attention learning method to distill the external memory into smaller
representative subsets. We evaluate our method on a public histology image
dataset and an in-house MRI dataset, demonstrating that MoViT applied to varied
medical image analysis tasks, can outperform vanilla transformer models across
varied data regimes, especially in cases where only a small amount of annotated
data is available. More importantly, MoViT can reach a competitive performance
of ViT with only 3.0% of the training data.

maliciously manipulates the model behavior through overlaying images with
special triggers. Existing backdoor defense methods often require accessing a
few validation data and model parameters, which are impractical in many
real-world applications, e.g., when the model is provided as a cloud service.
In this paper, we address the practical task of blind backdoor defense at test
time, in particular for black-box models. The true label of every test image
needs to be recovered on the fly from the hard label predictions of a
suspicious model. The heuristic trigger search in image space, however, is not
scalable to complex triggers or high image resolution. We circumvent such
barrier by leveraging generic image generation models, and propose a framework
of Blind Defense with Masked AutoEncoder (BDMAE). It uses the image structural
similarity and label consistency between the test image and MAE restorations to
detect possible triggers. The detection result is refined by considering the
topology of triggers. We obtain a purified test image from restorations for
making prediction. Our approach is blind to the model architectures, trigger
patterns or image benignity. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets with
different backdoor attacks validate its effectiveness and generalizability.

the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) of luminol. Through a systematic study of

optimized conditions at which it is possible to detect features with areas ~500

showing high-throughput detection of sub-micron defects. In particular, we
estimate the minimum detectable features to be lines as narrow as 2.5 nm in

by using it to characterize a nominally insulating phenol film and find
conductive defects that are cross-correlated with high-resolution atomic force

reference-based bridging), but the algorithms are far away from scaling for de
novo bridging as the underlying compacted de Bruijn graph(cdBG) used in the
latter task often contains millions of vertices and edges. We designed a new
truncated Dijkstra's algorithm for this problem, and proposed a novel algorithm
that reuses the shortest path tree to avoid running the truncated Dijkstra's
algorithm from scratch for all vertices for further speeding up. These
innovative techniques result in scalable algorithms that can bridge all
paired-end reads in a cdBG with millions of vertices. Our experiments showed
that paired-end RNA-seq reads can be accurately bridged to a large extent. The

The physiological role of this shape remains unclear. Previous research has
paid only little attention to the occurrence of transverse flow in the cochlea,
in particular in relation to the cochlea's shape. To better understand its
influence on fluid dynamics, this study aims to characterize transverse flow
due to harmonically oscillating axial flow in square ducts with curvature and
torsion, similar to the shape of human cochleae. Four geometries were
investigated to study curvature and torsion effects on axial and transverse
fluid flow components. Twelve frequencies from 0.125 Hz to 256 Hz were studied,
covering infrasound and low-frequency hearing, with mean inlet velocity
amplitudes representing levels expected for normal conversations or louder
situations. Our simulations show that torsion contributes significantly to
transverse flow in unsteady conditions, and that its contribution increases
with increasing oscillation frequencies. Curvature has a small effect on
transverse flow, which decreases rapidly for increasing frequencies.
Strikingly, the combined effect of curvature and torsion on transverse flow is
greater than expected from a simple superposition of the two effects,
especially when the relative contribution of curvature alone becomes
negligible. These findings could be relevant to understand physiological
processes in the cochlea, including metabolite transport and wall shear
stresses. Further studies are needed to investigate possible implications on
cochlear mechanics.

10s of billions of possibilities in recent history due to advances in chemical
synthesis. Traditional methods for identifying ``hit'' molecules from a large
collection of potential drug-like candidates have relied on biophysical theory
to compute approximations to the Gibbs free energy of the binding interaction
between the drug to its protein target. A major drawback of the approaches is
that they require exceptional computing capabilities to consider for even
relatively small collections of molecules.
  Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is a recently proposed learning paradigm
that is able to leverage low-precision binary vector arithmetic to build
efficient representations of the data that can be obtained without the need for
gradient-based optimization approaches that are required in many conventional
machine learning and deep learning approaches. This algorithmic simplicity
allows for acceleration in hardware that has been previously demonstrated for a
range of application areas. We consider existing HDC approaches for molecular
property classification and introduce two novel encoding algorithms that
leverage the extended connectivity fingerprint (ECFP) algorithm.
  We show that HDC-based inference methods are as much as 90 times more
efficient than more complex representative machine learning methods and achieve
an acceleration of nearly 9 orders of magnitude as compared to inference with
molecular docking. We demonstrate multiple approaches for the encoding of
molecular data for HDC and examine their relative performance on a range of
challenging molecular property prediction and drug-protein binding
classification tasks. Our work thus motivates further investigation into
molecular representation learning to develop ultra-efficient pre-screening

generation in quadrotors. Most trajectory generation methods for waypoint
navigation of quadrotors, for example minimum snap/jerk and minimum-time, are
structured as bi-level optimizations. The first level involves allocating time
across all input waypoints and the second step is to minimize the snap/jerk of
the trajectory under that time allocation. Such an optimization can be
computationally expensive to solve. In our approach we treat trajectory
generation as a supervised learning problem between a sequential set of inputs
and outputs. We adapt a transformer model to learn the optimal time allocations
for a given set of input waypoints, thus making it into a single step
optimization. We demonstrate the performance of the transformer model by
training it to predict the time allocations for a minimum snap trajectory
generator. The trained transformer model is able to predict accurate time
allocations with fewer data samples and smaller model size, compared to a
feedforward network (FFN), demonstrating that it is able to model the
sequential nature of the waypoint navigation problem.

explaining planetesimal formation. The previous studies on secular GI utilized
a razor-thin disk model and derived the growth condition in terms of the
vertically integrated physical values such as dust-to-gas surface density
ratio. However, in weakly turbulent disks where secular GI can operate, a dust
disk can be orders of magnitude thinner than a gas disk, and analyses treating
the vertical structures are necessary to clarify the interplay of the midplane
dust motion and the upper gas motion. In this work, we perform vertically
global linear analyses of secular GI with the vertical domain size of a few gas
scale heights. We find that dust grains accumulate radially around the midplane
while gas circulates over the whole vertical region. We obtain well-converged
growth rates when the outer gas boundary is above two gas scale heights. The
growth rates are underestimated if we assume the upper gas to be steady and
regard it just as the source of external pressure to the dusty lower layer.
Therefore, treating the upper gas motion is important even when the dust disk
is much thinner than the gas disk. Conducting a parameter survey, we represent
the growth condition in terms of the Toomre's $Q$ value for dust and
dust-to-gas surface density ratio. The critical dust disk mass for secular GI
is $\sim10^{-4}$ stellar mass for the dust-to-gas surface density ratio of
0.01, the Stokes number of 0.1, and dimensionless radial dust diffusivity of
$10^{-4}$.

infinite line. Feasible solutions are agent trajectories in which all agents
reach the target sooner or later. A special feature of our problem is that the
agents are $p$-faulty, meaning that every attempt to change direction is an
independent Bernoulli trial with known probability $p$, where $p$ is the
probability that a turn fails. We are looking for agent trajectories that
minimize the worst-case expected termination time, relative to competitive
analysis.
  First, we study linear search with one deterministic $p$-faulty agent, i.e.,
with no access to random oracles, $p\in (0,1/2)$. For this problem, we provide
trajectories that leverage the probabilistic faults into an algorithmic
advantage. Our strongest result pertains to a search algorithm (deterministic,
aside from the adversarial probabilistic faults) which, as $p\to 0$, has
optimal performance $4.59112+\epsilon$, up to the additive term $\epsilon$ that
can be arbitrarily small. Additionally, it has performance less than $9$ for
$p\leq 0.390388$. When $p\to 1/2$, our algorithm has performance
$\Theta(1/(1-2p))$, which we also show is optimal up to a constant factor.
  Second, we consider linear search with two $p$-faulty agents, $p\in (0,1/2)$,
for which we provide three algorithms of different advantages, all with a
bounded competitive ratio even as $p\rightarrow 1/2$. Indeed, for this problem,
we show how the agents can simulate the trajectory of any $0$-faulty agent
(deterministic or randomized), independently of the underlying communication
model. As a result, searching with two agents allows for a solution with a
competitive ratio of $9+\epsilon$, or a competitive ratio of
$4.59112+\epsilon$. Our final contribution is a novel algorithm for searching
with two $p$-faulty agents that achieves a competitive ratio
$3+4\sqrt{p(1-p)}$.

Millimetre-submm Array (ALMA) observations provide a complementary view of the
activity and the thermal structure of stellar atmospheres. These two
diagnostics together can provide insights into the physical properties of
stellar atmospheres. In this paper, we present a comparative study between
synthetic continuum brightness temperature maps for mm wavelengths (0.3 mm to
8.5 mm) and the width of the Ha 6565{\AA} line. The 3D radiative transfer codes
Multi3D and Advanced Radiative Transfer (ART) are used to calculate synthetic
spectra for the Ha line and the mm continua respectively, from an enhanced
network atmosphere model with non-equilibrium hydrogen ionisation generated
with the state-of-the-art 3D rMHD code Bifrost. We use Gaussian Point Spread
Function (PSF) for simulating the effect of ALMA's limited spatial resolution
and calculate the Ha vs. mm continuum correlations and slopes of scatter plots
for the original and degraded resolution of the whole box, quiet sun and
enhanced network patches separately. The Ha linewidth and mm brightness
temperatures are highly correlated and the correlation is highest at a
wavelength 0.8 mm i.e. ALMA Band 7. The correlation increases with decreased
resolution. On the other hand, the slopes decrease with increasing wavelength.
The degradation of resolution does not have a significant impact on the
calculated slopes. With decreasing spatial resolution the standard deviations
of the observables, Ha linewidth and brightness temperatures decrease and the
correlations between them increase, but the slopes do not change significantly.
Hence, these relations may prove useful to calibrate the mm continuum maps
observed with ALMA.

implemented on Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes, a commonly-studied category

operators of this form are fault-tolerant because each qubit is acted upon by
at most one gate, limiting the spread of errors, and are referred to as
transversal logical operators. Identifying transversal logical operators
outside the Pauli group is less well understood. Pauli operators are the first
level of the Clifford hierarchy which is deeply connected to fault-tolerance
and universality. In this work, we study transversal logical operators composed

algorithms for identifying all transversal diagonal logical operators on a CSS

locations of each object, the actions of moving objects, and the sounds in
videos. Existing visual-language modeling tasks often concentrate on visual
cues in videos while undervaluing the language and audio modalities. On the
other hand, FAVD requires not only audio-visual-language modeling skills but
also paragraph-level language generation abilities. We construct the first
fine-grained audible video description benchmark (FAVDBench) to facilitate this
research. For each video clip, we first provide a one-sentence summary of the
video, ie, the caption, followed by 4-6 sentences describing the visual details
and 1-2 audio-related descriptions at the end. The descriptions are provided in
both English and Chinese. We create two new metrics for this task: an
EntityScore to gauge the completeness of entities in the visual descriptions,
and an AudioScore to assess the audio descriptions. As a preliminary approach
to this task, we propose an audio-visual-language transformer that extends
existing video captioning model with an additional audio branch. We combine the
masked language modeling and auto-regressive language modeling losses to
optimize our model so that it can produce paragraph-level descriptions. We
illustrate the efficiency of our model in audio-visual-language modeling by
evaluating it against the proposed benchmark using both conventional captioning
metrics and our proposed metrics. We further put our benchmark to the test in
video generation models, demonstrating that employing fine-grained video
descriptions can create more intricate videos than using captions.

Response (DR) resources. A typical DR mechanism requires the DR manager to
assign a baseline to the participating consumer, where the baseline is an
estimate of the counterfactual consumption of the consumer had it not been

incentive the consumer has to inflate the baseline estimate. We consider the
problem of learning online to estimate the baseline and to optimize the
operating costs over a period of time under such incentives. We propose an
online learning scheme that employs least-squares for estimation with a
perturbation to the reward price (for the DR services or load curtailment) that
is designed to balance the exploration and exploitation trade-off that arises
with online learning. We show that, our proposed scheme is able to achieve a
very low regret of $\mathcal{O}\left((\log{T})^2\right)$ with respect to the
optimal operating cost over $T$ days of the DR program with full knowledge of
the baseline, and is individually rational for the consumers to participate.
Our scheme is significantly better than the averaging type approach, which only
fetches $\mathcal{O}(T^{1/3})$ regret.

straightforward owing to the complex nature of flux variability in these
systems. Line-width measurements become especially challenging when
signal-to-noise is low, profiles are narrower, or spectral resolution is low.
We conducted an extensive correlation analysis between emission-line
measurements from the optical spectra of Markarian 142 (Mrk 142; a narrow-line
Seyfert galaxy) taken with the Gemini North Telescope (Gemini) at a spectral
resolution of 185.6+\-10.2 km/s and the Lijiang Telescope (LJT) at 695.2+\-3.9
km/s to investigate the disparities in the measured broad-line widths from both
telescope data. Mrk~142 posed a challenge due to its narrow broad-line
profiles, which were severely affected by instrumental broadening in the
lower-resolution LJT spectra. We discovered that allowing the narrow-line flux
of permitted lines having broad and narrow components to vary during spectral
fitting caused a leak in the narrow-line flux to the broad component, resulting
in broader broad-line widths in the LJT spectra. Fixing the narrow-line flux
ratios constrained the flux leak and yielded the Hydrogen-beta broad-line
widths from LJT spectra $\sim$54\% closer to the Gemini Hydrogen-beta widths
than with flexible narrow-line ratios. The availability of spectra at different
resolutions presented this unique opportunity to inspect how spectral
resolution affected emission-line profiles in our data and adopt a unique
method to accurately measure broad-line widths. Reconsidering line-measurement
methods while studying diverse AGN populations is critical for the success of
future reverberation-mapping studies. Based on the technique used in this work,
we offer recommendations for measuring line widths in narrow-line AGN.

(LMXBs) is critical for determining the moment of jet ejection, and identifying
any corresponding signatures in the accretion flow. However, these jets are
often highly variable and can travel across the resolution element of an image
within a single observation, violating a fundamental assumption of aperture
synthesis. We present a novel approach in which we directly fit a single
time-dependent model to the full set of interferometer visibilities, where we
explicitly parameterise the motion and flux density variability of the emission
components, to minimise the number of free parameters in the fit, while
leveraging information from the full observation. This technique allows us to
detect and characterize faint, fast-moving sources, for which the standard time
binning technique is inadequate. We validate our technique with synthetic
observations, before applying it to three Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)
observations of the black hole candidate LMXB MAXI J1803-298 during its 2021
outburst. We measured the proper motion of a discrete jet component to be
$1.37\pm0.14$ mas/hr, and thus we infer an ejection date of MJD
$59348.08_{-0.06}^{+0.05}$, which occurs just after the peak of a radio flare
observed by the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) and the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Sub-Millimeter Array (ALMA), while MAXI J1803-298 was in the
intermediate state. Further development of these new VLBI analysis techniques
will lead to more precise measurements of jet ejection dates, which, combined
with dense, simultaneous multi-wavelength monitoring, will allow for clearer
identification of jet ejection signatures in the accretion flow.

DeepONet to produce the boundary-to-solution mapping. This mapping takes the
geometry of the physical domain along with the boundary conditions as inputs to
output the steady state solution of the groundwater flow equation. To implement
the DeepONet, the authors approximate the top and bottom boundaries using
truncated Fourier series or piecewise linear representations. They present two
different implementations of the DeepONet: one where the Toth basin is embedded
in a rectangular computational domain, and another where the Toth basin with
arbitrary top and bottom boundaries is mapped into a rectangular computational
domain via a nonlinear transformation. They implement the DeepONet with respect
to the Dirichlet and Robin boundary condition at the top and the Neumann
boundary condition at the impervious bottom boundary, respectively. Using this
deep-learning enabled tool, the authors investigate the impact of surface
topography on the flow pattern by both the top surface and the bottom
impervious boundary with arbitrary geometries. They discover that the average
slope of the top surface promotes long-distance transport, while the local
curvature controls localized circulations. Additionally, they find that the
slope of the bottom impervious boundary can seriously impact the long-distance
transport of groundwater flows. Overall, this paper presents a new and
innovative approach to solving the groundwater flow equation using deep
learning, which allows for the investigation of the impact of surface
topography on groundwater flow patterns.

the material characterization properties of different thermoelectric materials
using various techniques, implementation of machine learning models to predict
the power factor of bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3) during the AM process has not
been explored. This is important as Bi2Te3 is a standard material for low
temperature applications. Thus, we used data about manufacturing processing
parameters involved and in-situ sensor monitoring data collected during AM of
Bi2Te3, to train different machine learning models in order to predict its
thermoelectric power factor. We implemented supervised machine learning
techniques using 80% training and 20% test data and further used the
permutation feature importance method to identify important processing

  light on the extragalactic distance scale","16 pages, 11 figures, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical
  Journal",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Because of their period-luminosity relation (PLR), classical Cepheids play a
key role in the calibration of the extragalactic distance scale and the
determination of the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant $H_0$. Recent findings show
that the majority of classical Cepheids should be in binary or multiple
systems, which might undermine their accuracy, as the extra -- and unaccounted
for -- light from the companions of Cepheids causes a shift in the PLR. We
quantify this shift using synthetic populations of binary Cepheids that we
developed for this purpose, as described in Paper I of this series. We find
that while all PLRs are shifted toward brighter values due to the excess light
from the companions, the bias in the relative distance modulus between two
galaxies hosting binary Cepheids can be either positive or negative, depending
on the percentage of binary Cepheids in them. If the binarity percentage in the
two galaxies is similar, the effect of binarity is canceled. Otherwise, it
introduces a shift in the distance modulus of the order of millimags in the
near-infrared passbands and Wesenheit indices, and tens of millimags in the
visual domain; its exact value depends on the variant of the synthetic
population (a unique combination of metallicity, star formation history, shape
and location of the instability strip, and initial parameter distributions).
Such shifts in distance moduli to type Ia supernova host galaxies introduce an
additional statistical error on $H_0$, which however does not prevent measuring
$H_0$ with a precision of 1%.

significant step in this direction, wherein, we propose, thermochromism
assisted photon transport based optical charging for efficient latent heat
storage. Seeding thermochromic nanoparticles into the phase change material
(PCM) allows for dynamic control of PCM's optical properties - aiding deeper
penetration of photons and hence significantly enhancing the
photon-nanoparticle interactions. Moreover, carefully tailoring of transition
temperature near the melting temperature allows for efficient non-radiative
decay of the absorbed photon energy and that too under nearly thermostatic
conditions. In particular, the present work serves to develop a mechanistic
opto-thermal theoretical modelling framework to compute melting front
progression, latent heat storage and sensible heat discharging capacities
pertinent to thermochromism assisted photon transport. Moreover, to truly
assess and quantify the benefits of the aforementioned charging route, a host
of other possible charging routes (viz., thermal and non-thermochromic optical
charging) have also been dealt with. Detailed analysis reveals that relative to
the thermal charging route, thermochromism assisted optical charging offers
significant enhancements in terms of melting front progression (approximately
152%) and latent heat storage capacity (approximately 167%). Overall,
thermochromism assisted photon transport is a synergistic approach which allows
for simultaneous collection and storage of solar energy at accelerated rates

of the magnetorotational instability (MRI)-dust coevolution in protoplanetary
disks by presenting a proof of concept that dust evolution ultimately plays a
crucial role in the MRI activity. Methods. First, we study how a fixed
power-law dust size distribution with varying parameters impacts the MRI
activity, especially the steady-state MRI-driven accretion, by employing and
improving our previous 1+1D MRI-driven turbulence model. Second, we relax the
steady-state accretion assumption in this disk accretion model, and partially
couple it to a dust evolution model in order to investigate how the evolution
of dust (dynamics and grain growth processes combined) and MRI-driven accretion
are intertwined on million-year timescales. Results. Dust coagulation and
settling lead to a higher gas ionization degree in the protoplanetary disk,
resulting in stronger MRI-driven turbulence as well as a more compact dead
zone. On the other hand, fragmentation has an opposite effect because it
replenishes the disk in small dust particles. Since the dust content of the
disk decreases over million years of evolution due to radial drift, the
MRI-driven turbulence overall becomes stronger and the dead zone more compact
until the disk dust-gas mixture eventually behaves as a grain-free plasma.
Furthermore, our results show that dust evolution alone does not lead to a
complete reactivation of the dead zone. Conclusions. The MRI activity evolution
(hence the temporal evolution of the MRI-induced $\alpha$-parameter) is
controlled by dust evolution and occurs on a timescale of local dust growth, as
long as there is enough dust particles in the disk to dominate the
recombination process for the ionization chemistry. Once it is no longer the
case, it is expected to be controlled by gas evolution and occurs on a viscous
evolution timescale.

problem as a balance among multiple update agents such as data-fitting terms
and denoisers. However, each such agent operates on a separate copy of the full
image, leading to redundant memory use and slow convergence when each agent
affects only a small subset of the full image. In this paper, we extend MACE to
Projected Multi-Agent Consensus Equilibrium (PMACE), in which each agent
updates only a projected component of the full image, thus greatly reducing
memory use for some applications.We describe PMACE in terms of an equilibrium
problem and an equivalent fixed point problem and show that in most cases the
PMACE equilibrium is not the solution of an optimization problem. To
demonstrate the value of PMACE, we apply it to the problem of ptychography, in
which a sample is reconstructed from the diffraction patterns resulting from
coherent X-ray illumination at multiple overlapping spots. In our PMACE
formulation, each spot corresponds to a separate data-fitting agent, with the
final solution found as an equilibrium among all the agents. Our results
demonstrate that the PMACE reconstruction algorithm generates more accurate
reconstructions at a lower computational cost than existing ptychography
algorithms when the spots are sparsely sampled.

lack of a consistent spatial fiducial for registration to different
point-spread-functions and tuning crystals or using filters to highlight
specific spectral regions make it difficult to develop broadly applicable
metrics to compare experiments across our stagnation image database without
making significant unverified assumptions. We leverage experimental data for a
model-free assessment of sensitivities to instrumentation-based features for
any specified image metric. In particular, we utilize a database of historical
and recent MagLIF data including $N_{\text{scans}} = 139$ image plate scans
gathered across $N_{\text{exp}} = 67$ different experiments to assess the
impact of a variety of features in the experimental observations arising from
uncertainties in registration as well as discrepancies in signal-to-noise ratio
and instrument resolution. We choose a wavelet-based image metric known as the
Mallat Scattering Transform for the study and highlight how alternate metric
choices could also be studied. In particular, we demonstrate a capability to
understand and mitigate the impact of signal-to-noise, image registration, and
resolution difference between images. This is achieved by utilizing multiple
scans of the same image plate, sampling random translations and rotations, and
applying instrument specific point-spread-functions found by ray tracing to

been observed in this energy range due to the short duration of SGRBs and the
weakness of current experiments. New experiments with new technology are
required to detect sub-TeV SGRBs. In this work, we observe the very high energy
(VHE) $\gamma$-ray emissions from SGRBs and calculate the annual detection rate
with the High Altitude Detection of Astronomical Radiation HADAR (HADAR)
experiment. First, a set of pseudo-SGRB samples is generated and checked using
the observations of Fermi-GBM, Fermi-LAT, and SWIFT measurements. The annual
detection rate is calculated from these SGRB samples based on the performance
of the HADAR instrument. As a result, the HADAR experiment can detect 0.5 SGRB
per year if the spectral break-off of $\gamma$-rays caused by the internal
absorption is larger than 100 GeV. For a GRB09010-like GRB in HADAR's view, it
should be possible to detect approximately 2000 photons considering the
internal absorption. With a time delay assumption due to the Lorentz invariance
violation effects, a simulated light curve of GRB090510 has evident energy
dependence. We hope that the HADAR experiment can perform the SGRB observations

gap, in this paper we specifically conduct an empirical study to investigate
(I) the characteristics of images, (II) the extent to which images are used in

Our results first show that user interface is the most common image content and
undesired output is the most frequent purpose for sharing images. Moreover,
these images essentially facilitate the understanding of 68% of sampled

thermal capacity of the latent heat of a Phase Change Material (PCM), provide
benefits to a variety of thermal management systems by decoupling the
absorption and rejection of thermal energy. While performing a role similar to
a battery in an electrical system, it is critical to know when to charge
(freeze) and discharge (melt) the TES to maximize the capabilities and
efficiency of the overall system. Therefore, control-oriented models of TES are
needed to predict the behavior of the TES and make informed control decisions.
While existing modeling approaches divide the TES in to multiple sections using
a Fixed Grid (FG) approach, this paper proposes a switched Moving Boundary (MB)
model that captures the key dynamics of the TES with significantly fewer
dynamic states. Specifically, a graph-based modeling approach is used to model
the heat flow through the TES and a MB approach is used to model the
time-varying liquid and solid regions of the TES. Additionally, a Finite State
Machine (FSM) is used to switch between four different modes of operation based
on the State-of-Charge (SOC) of the TES. Numerical simulations comparing the

capable of accurately modeling the behavior of the FG model while using far
fewer states, leading to five times faster simulations.

several attempts have been proposed to address IMVC, they suffer from the
following drawbacks: i) Existing methods mainly adopt cross-view contrastive
learning forcing the representations of each sample across views to be exactly
the same, which might ignore view discrepancy and flexibility in
representations; ii) Due to the absence of non-observed samples across multiple
views, the obtained prototypes of clusters might be unaligned and biased,
leading to incorrect fusion. To address the above issues, we propose a
Cross-view Partial Sample and Prototype Alignment Network (CPSPAN) for Deep
Incomplete Multi-view Clustering. Firstly, unlike existing contrastive-based
methods, we adopt pair-observed data alignment as 'proxy supervised signals' to
guide instance-to-instance correspondence construction among views. Then,
regarding of the shifted prototypes in IMVC, we further propose a prototype

discussed yet in relation to the birth environment of the solar system and to
infer the origin of isotopic ratios of Short-Lived Radionuclides (SLR, such as
$^{26}$Al) of Calcium-Aluminum-rich Inclusions (CAIs) observed in meteorites.
In this work, we present simple analytical estimates of the impact of stellar
feedback on the young solar system forming along a filament of a hub-filament
system. We find that the host filament can shield the young solar system from
the stellar feedback, both during the formation and evolution of stars (stellar
outflow, wind, and radiation) and at the end of their life (supernovae). We
show that the young solar system formed along a dense filament can be enriched
with supernova ejecta (e.g., $^{26}$Al) during the formation timescale of CAIs.
We also propose that the streamers recently observed around protostars may be
channeling the SLR-rich material onto the young solar system. We conclude that
considering hub-filament configurations as the birth environment of the Sun is
important when deriving theoretical models explaining the observed properties
of the solar system.

multilingual pre-trained language model to represent the text, the language
fusion module makes the semantic spaces of different languages tend to be
consistent through contrastive learning, and the text debiasing module uses
contrastive learning to make the model unable to identify sensitive attributes'
information. The text classification module completes the basic tasks of
multilingual text classification. In addition, the existing research on the
fairness of multilingual text classification is relatively simple in the
evaluation mode. The evaluation method of fairness is the same as the
monolingual equality difference evaluation method, that is, the evaluation is
performed on a single language. We propose a multi-dimensional fairness
evaluation framework for multilingual text classification, which evaluates the
model's monolingual equality difference, multilingual equality difference,
multilingual equality performance difference, and destructiveness of the
fairness strategy. We hope that our work can provide a more general debiasing
method and a more comprehensive evaluation framework for multilingual text
fairness tasks.

lack the ability of generalizing to domains which have not been seen during

of such models that the source and target data come from the same i.i.d.
distribution. Recently, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown outstanding
performance for a broad range of computer vision tasks. However, very few
studies have investigated their ability to generalize to new domains. This
paper presents a first Token-level Feature Stylization (TFS-ViT) approach for
domain generalization, which improves the performance of ViTs to unseen data by
synthesizing new domains. Our approach transforms token features by mixing the
normalization statistics of images from different domains. We further improve
this approach with a novel strategy for attention-aware stylization, which uses
the attention maps of class (CLS) tokens to compute and mix normalization
statistics of tokens corresponding to different image regions. The proposed
method is flexible to the choice of backbone model and can be easily applied to
any ViT-based architecture with a negligible increase in computational
complexity. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach is able to achieve
state-of-the-art performance on five challenging benchmarks for domain
generalization, and demonstrate its ability to deal with different types of
domain shifts. The implementation is available at:

new framework for activating sensors in networked discrete-event systems is
established. In this framework, we construct a communication automaton that
explicitly expresses the interaction process between the agent and the sensor

implementable and insensitive to non-deterministic control delays and

target model in practice, transfer-based attacks craft adversarial samples with
a local model and have attracted increasing attention from researchers due to
their high efficiency. The state-of-the-art transfer-based attacks are
generally based on data augmentation, which typically augments multiple

such methods selected the image augmentation path heuristically and may augment
images that are semantics-inconsistent with the target images, which harms the
transferability of the generated adversarial samples. To overcome the pitfall,
we propose the Path-Augmented Method (PAM). Specifically, PAM first constructs
a candidate augmentation path pool. It then settles the employed augmentation
paths during adversarial sample generation with greedy search. Furthermore, to
avoid augmenting semantics-inconsistent images, we train a Semantics Predictor

confirm that PAM can achieve an improvement of over 4.8% on average compared

purpose of this article is to prove somewhat surprising flexibilities -- a

  We construct infinitely many, mutually non-conjugate elements $g$ (in the

set of slopes whose complement does not contain Seifert surgery slopes can be
realized as the set $\mathcal{S}_K(g)$ for infinitely many, mutually

deep neural networks are useful to estimate unknown functions on high
dimensional input spaces. However, their generalization performance is not yet
completely clarified from the theoretical point of view because they are
nonidentifiable and singular learning machines. Moreover, a ReLU function is
not differentiable, to which algebraic or analytic methods in singular learning
theory cannot be applied. In this paper, we study a deep ReLU neural network in
overparametrized cases and prove that the Bayesian free energy, which is equal
to the minus log marginal likelihoodor the Bayesian stochastic complexity, is
bounded even if the number of layers are larger than necessary to estimate an
unknown data-generating function. Since the Bayesian generalization error is
equal to the increase of the free energy as a function of a sample size, our
result also shows that the Bayesian generalization error does not increase even
if a deep ReLU neural network is designed to be sufficiently large or in an

approximation (SA) algorithm under a contractive operator with respect to an

unbounded: (1) bounded multiplicative noise, and (2) additive sub-Gaussian
noise. We obtain maximal concentration inequalities on the convergence errors,
and show that these errors have sub-Gaussian tails in the additive noise
setting, and super-polynomial tails (faster than polynomial decay) in the
multiplicative noise setting. In addition, we provide an impossibility result
showing that it is in general not possible to achieve sub-exponential tails for
SA with multiplicative noise. To establish these results, we develop a novel
bootstrapping argument that involves bounding the moment generating function of
the generalized Moreau envelope of the error and the construction of an
exponential supermartingale to enable using Ville's maximal inequality.
  To demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical results, we use them to
provide maximal concentration bounds for a large class of reinforcement
learning algorithms, including but not limited to on-policy TD-learning with
linear function approximation, off-policy TD-learning with generalized
importance sampling factors, and $Q$-learning. To the best of our knowledge,
super-polynomial concentration bounds for off-policy TD-learning have not been
established in the literature due to the challenge of handling the combination

extremely high resolution and the absence of fine-grained labels. Presently,
WSIs are usually classified as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem when
only slide-level labels are available. MIL methods involve a patch embedding
process and a bag-level classification process, but they are prohibitively
expensive to be trained end-to-end. Therefore, existing methods usually train
them separately, or directly skip the training of the embedder. Such schemes
hinder the patch embedder's access to slide-level labels, resulting in
inconsistencies within the entire MIL pipeline. To overcome this issue, we
propose a novel framework called Iteratively Coupled MIL (ICMIL), which bridges
the loss back-propagation process from the bag-level classifier to the patch
embedder. In ICMIL, we use category information in the bag-level classifier to
guide the patch-level fine-tuning of the patch feature extractor. The refined
embedder then generates better instance representations for achieving a more
accurate bag-level classifier. By coupling the patch embedder and bag
classifier at a low cost, our proposed framework enables information exchange
between the two processes, benefiting the entire MIL classification model. We
tested our framework on two datasets using three different backbones, and our
experimental results demonstrate consistent performance improvements over
state-of-the-art MIL methods. Code will be made available upon acceptance.

Transfer-based attacks use a local model to generate adversarial samples and
directly transfer them to attack a target black-box model. The high efficiency

applications. Therefore, it is vital to design effective transfer-based attacks
to identify the deficiencies of ViTs beforehand in security-sensitive
scenarios. Existing efforts generally focus on regularizing the input gradients
to stabilize the updated direction of adversarial samples. However, the
variance of the back-propagated gradients in intermediate blocks of ViTs may
still be large, which may make the generated adversarial samples focus on some

Tolerance (PBFT) is seen as the most applicable consensus mechanism in
blockchain-enabled wireless networks. However, previous studies on PBFT do not
consider the channel performance of the physical layer, such as path loss and
channel fading, resulting in research results that are far from real networks.
Additionally, 6G communications will widely deploy high frequency signals such
as millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz), while the performance of PBFT
is still unknown when these signals are transmitted in wireless PBFT networks.
Therefore, it is urgent to study the performance of non-ideal wireless PBFT
networks with mmWave and THz siganls, so as to better make PBFT play a role in
6G era. In this paper, we study and compare the performance of mmWave and THz
signals in non-ideal wireless PBFT networks, considering Rayleigh Fading (RF)
and close-in Free Space (FS) reference distance path loss. Performance is
evaluated by consensus success rate and delay. Meanwhile, we find and derive
that there is a maximum distance between two nodes that can make PBFT consensus
inevitably successful, and it is named active distance of PBFT in this paper.
The research results not only analyze the performance of non-ideal wireless
PBFT networks, but also provide an important reference for the future

The topological entanglement entropy of the BTZ black hole was calculated and
found that it coincides with that for fractional quantum Hall states. So the
BTZ black hole has the same topological order with the fractional quantum Hall

order, by showing that the topological entanglement entropy of black holes is
non-zero in loop quantum gravity. We also consider the Hamiltonian constraint
in loop quantum gravity. By comparing with the BF theory, we found that the
physical Hilbert space for loop quantum gravity is degenerate on non-trivial

  Pruning","9 pages, 8 figures; Accepted to AAAI 2023 (Oral)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Correspondence pruning aims to search consistent correspondences (inliers)
from a set of putative correspondences. It is challenging because of the
disorganized spatial distribution of numerous outliers, especially when
putative correspondences are largely dominated by outliers. It's more
challenging to ensure effectiveness while maintaining efficiency. In this
paper, we propose an effective and efficient method for correspondence pruning.
Inspired by the success of attentive context in correspondence problems, we
first extend the attentive context to the first-order attentive context and
then introduce the idea of attention in attention (ANA) to model second-order
attentive context for correspondence pruning. Compared with first-order
attention that focuses on feature-consistent context, second-order attention
dedicates to attention weights itself and provides an additional source to
encode consistent context from the attention map. For efficiency, we derive two
approximate formulations for the naive implementation of second-order attention
to optimize the cubic complexity to linear complexity, such that second-order
attention can be used with negligible computational overheads. We further
implement our formulations in a second-order context layer and then incorporate
the layer in an ANA block. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is
effective and efficient in pruning outliers, especially in high-outlier-ratio
cases. Compared with the state-of-the-art correspondence pruning approach
LMCNet, our method runs 14 times faster while maintaining a competitive
accuracy.

integrates the guidance of the target text by utilizing text-relevant spatial

existing works lack standard benchmarks and automated metrics for evaluation,
often relying on subjective and non-reproducible user studies to assess the

a given DM density distribution is determined by a modified Poisson equation
including fractional derivatives (i.e., derivatives of non-integer type), that
are meant to describe non-local effects. We derive analytically the expression
of the potential that in fractional gravity corresponds to various spherically
symmetric density profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
distribution that is usually exploited to describe virialized halos of
collisionless DM as extracted from $N-$body cosmological simulations. We show
that in fractional gravity the dynamics of a test particle moving in a cuspy
NFW density distribution is substantially altered with respect to the Newtonian
case (i.e., basing on the standard Poisson equation), mirroring what in
Newtonian gravity would instead be sourced by a density profile with an inner
core. We test the fractional gravity framework on galactic scales, showing
that: (i) it can provide accurate fits to the stacked rotation curves of
galaxies with different properties; (ii) it can reproduce to reasonable
accuracy the observed shape and scatter of the radial acceleration relation

to compensate for incomplete information and map sparse-view measurements to
the CT reconstruction. However, reconstruction from sparsely sampled
measurements is insufficient to uniquely characterize an object in CT, and a
learned prior model may be inadequate for unencountered cases. Medical modal
translation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to CT is an alternative but
may introduce incorrect information into the synthesized CT images in addition
to the fact that there exists no explicit transformation describing their
relationship. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called the
denoising diffusion model for medical image synthesis (DDMM-Synth) to close the
performance gaps described above. This framework combines an MRI-guided
diffusion model with a new CT measurement embedding reverse sampling scheme.
Specifically, the null-space content of the one-step denoising result is
refined by the MRI-guided data distribution prior, and its range-space
component derived from an explicit operator matrix and the sparse-view CT
measurements is directly integrated into the inference stage. DDMM-Synth can
adjust the projection number of CT a posteriori for a particular clinical
application and its modified version can even improve the results significantly

"2303.15779","Daiying Yin","Juan-Pablo Ortega, Daiying Yin","Learnability of Linear Port-Hamiltonian Systems",,,,,"math.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  A complete structure-preserving learning scheme for
single-input/single-output (SISO) linear port-Hamiltonian systems is proposed.
The construction is based on the solution, when possible, of the unique
identification problem for these systems, in ways that reveal fundamental
relationships between classical notions in control theory and crucial
properties in the machine learning context, like structure-preservation and
expressive power. In the canonical case, it is shown that the set of uniquely
identified systems can be explicitly characterized as a smooth manifold endowed
with global Euclidean coordinates, which allows concluding that the parameter
complexity necessary for the replication of the dynamics is only $O(n)$ and not
$O(n^2)$, as suggested by the standard parametrization of these systems.
Furthermore, it is shown that linear port-Hamiltonian systems can be learned
while remaining agnostic about the dimension of the underlying data-generating
system. Numerical experiments show that this methodology can be used to
efficiently estimate linear port-Hamiltonian systems out of input-output
realizations, making the contributions in this paper the first example of a
structure-preserving machine learning paradigm for linear port-Hamiltonian
systems based on explicit representations of this model category.

fields with time delay for different cycles in pulse. Novel findings include
that for subcycle fields, the remarkable vortex structure in the momentum
spectrum can be still caused by a large time delay compared to the previous
study for supercycle case where it is easier to be generated by a small time
delay. And also there exist a range of critical polarization values for the
vortices appearance corresponding to the different cycle number. The relative
phase difference between two fields causes not only severe symmetry breaking of
the momentum spectra pattern and vortex, but also a significant change for the
shape and the number of vortex spiral. Upon the number density, it is found a
more sensitive to the cycle number, in particularly, it is enhanced by more
than one order of magnitude for small cycle pulse, while it is increased about
few times when the time delay is small. These results provide an abundant
theoretical testbed for the possible experimental observation on the
multiphoton pair production in future. Meanwhile, it is applicable to regard
the particles momentum signatures as a new probing to the laser field

Pre-training (CLIP) has shown great potential in providing interaction prior
for HOI detectors via knowledge distillation. However, such approaches often
rely on large-scale training data and suffer from inferior performance under

framework that efficiently extracts prior knowledge from CLIP and achieves
better generalization. In detail, we first introduce a novel interaction
decoder to extract informative regions in the visual feature map of CLIP via a
cross-attention mechanism, which is then fused with the detection backbone by a
knowledge integration block for more accurate human-object pair detection. In
addition, prior knowledge in CLIP text encoder is leveraged to generate a
classifier by embedding HOI descriptions. To distinguish fine-grained
interactions, we build a verb classifier from training data via visual semantic
arithmetic and a lightweight verb representation adapter. Furthermore, we
propose a training-free enhancement to exploit global HOI predictions from
CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state
of the art by a large margin on various settings, e.g. +4.04 mAP on HICO-Det.

were computationally investigated with a particular interest in identifying and
characterizing various distinct dynamical behaviors of the flame oscillators
under different swirling flow conditions. By varying the external swirl, six
distinct flame dynamical modes, such as the flickering flame, the oscillating
flame, the steady flame, the lifted flame, the spiral flame, and the flame with
a vortex bubble, were computationally identified in both physical and phase
spaces and analyzed from the perspective of vortex dynamics. Specifically, the
frequency of buoyancy-induced flame flicker nonlinearly increases with the
swirling intensity in the weak swirl regime. Further increasing the swirling
intensity causes the vortex shedding to occur either around the flame tip or
downstream of the flame, and the flame stops flickering but oscillates with
small amplitude or stays in a steady state. A sufficiently high swirling
intensity locally extinguishes the flame at its base, leading to a lifted
flame. In addition, the spiral mode and the vortex-bubble mode were found for
the flame at large swirl angles. Through establishing the phase portrait for
featuring the flow in flames, the dynamical behaviors are presented and
compared in phase space.

digital cameras, and it is one of the many tasks within the field of image
restoration. A well-known characteristic of natural images is that most patches
are smooth, while high-content patches like textures or repetitive patterns are
much rarer, which results in a long-tailed distribution. This distribution can
create an inductive bias when training machine learning algorithms for image
restoration tasks and for image demosaicing in particular. There have been many
different approaches to address this challenge, such as utilizing specific
losses or designing special network architectures. What makes our work is
unique in that it tackles the problem from a training protocol perspective. Our
proposed training regime consists of two key steps. The first step is a
data-mining stage where sub-categories are created and then refined through an
elimination process to only retain the most helpful sub-categories. The second
step is a cyclic training process where the neural network is trained on both
the mined sub-categories and the original dataset. We have conducted various
experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our training method for the
image demosaicing task. Our results show that this method outperforms standard
training across a range of architecture sizes and types, including CNNs and
Transformers. Moreover, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art results with a

ultra-low noise superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors to suppress
the system noise to around 0.02 Hz. The secure key rate is $9.53\times10^{-12}$

$8.75\times10^{-12}$ per pulse at 952 km considering the finite size effect.

object-centric features to represent navigable candidates. However, these
representations are not efficient enough for an agent to perform actions to
arrive the target location. As knowledge provides crucial information which is
complementary to visible content, in this paper, we propose a Knowledge
Enhanced Reasoning Model (KERM) to leverage knowledge to improve agent
navigation ability. Specifically, we first retrieve facts (i.e., knowledge
described by language descriptions) for the navigation views based on local
regions from the constructed knowledge base. The retrieved facts range from
properties of a single object (e.g., color, shape) to relationships between
objects (e.g., action, spatial position), providing crucial information for
VLN. We further present the KERM which contains the purification, fact-aware
interaction, and instruction-guided aggregation modules to integrate visual,
history, instruction, and fact features. The proposed KERM can automatically
select and gather crucial and relevant cues, obtaining more accurate action
prediction. Experimental results on the REVERIE, R2R, and SOON datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

directly take the Gaussian prior as input for the decoder to generate 3D point
clouds, which fail to learn disentangled latent codes, leading noisy
interpolated results. Most of the GAN-based models fail to discriminate the
local geometries, resulting in the point clouds generated not evenly
distributed at the object surface, hence degrading the point cloud generation

such as flow-based models and Markov chains, which take plenty of time and
resources in the training phase. To resolve these limitations, this paper
proposes a unified style-aware network architecture combining both point-wise
distance loss and adversarial loss, StarNet which is able to reconstruct and
generate high-fidelity and even 3D point clouds using a mapping network that
can effectively disentangle the Gaussian prior from input's high-level

between improving the policy to surpass the behavior policy and constraining
the policy to limit the deviation from the behavior policy as computing
$Q$-values using out-of-distribution (OOD) actions will suffer from errors due
to distributional shift. The recently proposed \textit{In-sample Learning}
paradigm (i.e., IQL), which improves the policy by quantile regression using
only data samples, shows great promise because it learns an optimal policy
without querying the value function of any unseen actions. However, it remains
unclear how this type of method handles the distributional shift in learning
the value function. In this work, we make a key finding that the in-sample
learning paradigm arises under the \textit{Implicit Value Regularization} (IVR)
framework. This gives a deeper understanding of why the in-sample learning
paradigm works, i.e., it applies implicit value regularization to the policy.
Based on the IVR framework, we further propose two practical algorithms, Sparse
$Q$-learning (SQL) and Exponential $Q$-learning (EQL), which adopt the same
value regularization used in existing works, but in a complete in-sample
manner. Compared with IQL, we find that our algorithms introduce sparsity in
learning the value function, making them more robust in noisy data regimes. We
also verify the effectiveness of SQL and EQL on D4RL benchmark datasets and
show the benefits of in-sample learning by comparing them with CQL in small

improvement, that can be achieved by analyzing multivariate functional data

of front-crawl swimmers, a new model-based approach is introduced to obtain two
complementary partitions reflecting, for each swimmer, its swimming pattern and
its ability to reproduce it. Contrary to the usual approaches for functional
data clustering, the proposed approach also considers the information of the
residuals resulting from the functional basis decomposition. Indeed, after
decomposing into functional basis both the original signal (measuring the
swimming pattern) and the signal of squared residuals (measuring the ability to
reproduce the swimming pattern), the method fits the joint distribution of the
coefficients related to both decompositions by considering dependency between
both partitions. Modeling this dependency is mandatory since the difficulty of
reproducing a swimming pattern depends on its shape. Moreover, a sparse
decomposition of the distribution within components that permits a selection of
the relevant dimensions during clustering is proposed. The partitions obtained
on the IMU data aggregate the kinematical stroke variability linked to swimming
technical skills and allow relevant biomechanical strategy for front-crawl
sprint performance to be identified.

end-diastolic and end-systolic pressure-volume relationships (EDPVR & ESPVR),
are two important indicators of the performance of the human heart. Although
much research has been conducted on EDPVR and ESPVR, no model with physically
interpretable parameters combining both relationships has been presented,
thereby impairing the understanding of cardiac physiology and pathology. Here,
we present a model that evaluates both EDPVR and ESPVR with physical
interpretations of the parameters in a unified framework. Our physics-based
model fits the available experimental data and in silico results very well and
outperforms existing models. With prescribed parameters, the new model is used
to predict the pressure-volume relationships of the left ventricle. Our model
provides a deeper understanding of cardiac mechanics and thus will have
applications in cardiac research and clinical medicine.

biometric applications. Physical adversarial attacks, as an important
surrogate, can identify the weaknesses of face recognition systems and evaluate
their robustness before deployed. However, most existing physical attacks are
either detectable readily or ineffective against commercial recognition
systems. The goal of this work is to develop a more reliable technique that can
carry out an end-to-end evaluation of adversarial robustness for commercial
systems. It requires that this technique can simultaneously deceive black-box
recognition models and evade defensive mechanisms. To fulfill this, we design
adversarial textured 3D meshes (AT3D) with an elaborate topology on a human
face, which can be 3D-printed and pasted on the attacker's face to evade the
defenses. However, the mesh-based optimization regime calculates gradients in
high-dimensional mesh space, and can be trapped into local optima with
unsatisfactory transferability. To deviate from the mesh-based space, we
propose to perturb the low-dimensional coefficient space based on 3D Morphable
Model, which significantly improves black-box transferability meanwhile
enjoying faster search efficiency and better visual quality. Extensive
experiments in digital and physical scenarios show that our method effectively
explores the security vulnerabilities of multiple popular commercial services,

mobile phones and two automated access control systems.

  Based Evolutionary Search",,,,,"cs.LG cs.GT cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the field of security, multi-objective security games (MOSGs) allow
defenders to simultaneously protect targets from multiple heterogeneous
attackers. MOSGs aim to simultaneously maximize all the heterogeneous payoffs,
e.g., life, money, and crime rate, without merging heterogeneous attackers. In
real-world scenarios, the number of heterogeneous attackers and targets to be
protected may exceed the capability of most existing state-of-the-art methods,
i.e., MOSGs are limited by the issue of scalability. To this end, this paper
proposes a general framework called SDES based on many-objective evolutionary
search to scale up MOSGs to large-scale targets and heterogeneous attackers.
SDES consists of four consecutive key components, i.e., discretization,
optimization, evaluation, and refinement. Specifically, SDES first discretizes
the originally high-dimensional continuous solution space to the
low-dimensional discrete one by the maximal indifference property in game
theory. This property helps evolutionary algorithms (EAs) bypass the
high-dimensional step function and ensure a well-convergent Pareto front. Then,
a many-objective EA is used for optimization in the low-dimensional discrete
solution space to obtain a well-spaced Pareto front. To evaluate solutions,
SDES restores solutions back to the original space via greedily optimizing a
novel divergence measurement. Finally, the refinement in SDES boosts the
optimization performance with acceptable cost. Theoretically, we prove the
optimization consistency and convergence of SDES. Experiment results show that
SDES is the first linear-time MOSG algorithm for both large-scale attackers and
targets. SDES is able to solve up to 20 attackers and 100 targets MOSG
problems, while the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods can only solve up to 8
attackers and 25 targets ones. Ablation study verifies the necessity of all
components in SDES.

that experts must first classify the images manually. Artificial intelligence
systems can take over this task but usually need a large number of
already-labeled training images to achieve sufficient performance. This
requirement necessitates human expert labor and poses a particular challenge
for projects with few cameras or short durations. We propose a label-efficient
learning strategy that enables researchers with small or medium-sized image
databases to leverage the potential of modern machine learning, thus freeing
crucial resources for subsequent analyses.
  Our methodological proposal is two-fold: (1) We improve current strategies of
combining object detection and image classification by tuning the
hyperparameters of both models. (2) We provide an active learning (AL) system
that allows training deep learning models very efficiently in terms of required
human-labeled training images. We supply a software package that enables
researchers to use these methods directly and thereby ensure the broad

  We show that our tuning strategy improves predictive performance. We
demonstrate how the AL pipeline reduces the amount of pre-labeled data needed
to achieve a specific predictive performance and that it is especially valuable
for improving out-of-sample predictive performance.
  We conclude that the combination of tuning and AL increases predictive
performance substantially. Furthermore, we argue that our work can broadly
impact the community through the ready-to-use software package provided.

These findings are then used for two purposes. First, we investigate existence

necessary optimality conditions via the value function approach, it is inherent
to differentiate frontier-type mappings in a generalized way. Here, we are
concerned with the computation of upper coderivative estimates for the

advantages in various quantum informational tasks. However, characterizing and
calibrating the effect of noise is not always feasible in practice. Especially
for quantum parameter estimation, an estimator constructed without precise
knowledge of noise entails an inevitable bias. Recently, virtual
purification-based error mitigation (VPEM) has been proposed to apply for
quantum metrology to reduce such a bias occurring from unknown noise. While it
was demonstrated to work for particular cases, whether VPEM always reduces a
bias for general estimation schemes is unclear yet. For more general
applications of VPEM to quantum metrology, we study factors determining whether
VPEM can reduce the bias. We find that the closeness between the dominant
eigenvector of a noisy state and the ideal quantum probe (without noise) with
respect to an observable determines the reducible amount of bias by VPEM. Next,
we show that one should carefully choose the reference point of the target
parameter, which gives the smallest bias because the bias depends on the
reference point. Otherwise, even if the dominant eigenvector and the ideal
quantum probe are close, the bias of the mitigated case could be larger than
the non-mitigated one. %We emphasize that the optimal reference point is a
unique feature that comes from the characteristic of quantum metrology.
Finally, we analyze the error mitigation for a phase estimation scheme under
various noises. Based on our analysis, we predict whether VPEM can effectively
reduce a bias and numerically verify our results.

The challenges in building ultra-high-definition (UHD) dehazing datasets are
the absence of estimation methods for UHD depth maps, high-quality 4K depth
estimation datasets, and migration strategies for UHD haze images from
synthetic to real domains. To address these problems, we develop a novel
synthetic method to simulate 4K hazy images (including nighttime and daytime
scenes) from clear images, which first estimates the scene depth, simulates the
light rays and object reflectance, then migrates the synthetic images to real
domains by using a GAN, and finally yields the hazy effects on 4K resolution
images. We wrap these synthesized images into a benchmark called the 4K-HAZE
dataset. Specifically, we design the CS-Mixer (an MLP-based model that
integrates \textbf{C}hannel domain and \textbf{S}patial domain) to estimate the
depth map of 4K clear images, the GU-Net to migrate a 4K synthetic image to the
real hazy domain. The most appealing aspect of our approach (depth estimation

metallicity measurements in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. To first
order, these measurements are characterised by the slope of the radial
metallicity profile, known as the metallicity gradient. In this work, we model
the relative role of star formation feedback, gas transport, cosmic gas
accretion, and galactic winds in driving radial metallicity profiles and
setting the mass-metallicity gradient relation (MZGR). We include a
comprehensive treatment of these processes by including them as sources that
supply mass, metals, and energy to marginally unstable galactic discs in
pressure and energy balance. We show that both feedback and accretion that can
drive turbulence and enhance metal-mixing via diffusion are crucial to
reproduce the observed MZGR in local galaxies. Metal transport also contributes
to setting metallicity profiles, but it is sensitive to the strength of radial
gas flows in galaxies. While the mass loading of galactic winds is important to
reproduce the mass metallicity relation (MZR), we find that metal mass loading
is more important to reproducing the MZGR. Specifically, our model predicts
preferential metal enrichment of galactic winds in low-mass galaxies. This
conclusion is robust against our adopted scaling of the wind mass-loading
factor, uncertainties in measured wind metallicities, and systematics due to
metallicity calibrations. Overall, we find that at $z \sim 0$, galactic winds
and metal transport are more important in setting metallicity gradients in
low-mass galaxies whereas star formation feedback and gas accretion dominate
setting metallicity gradients in massive galaxies.

variability on ultrafast timescales (i.e. shorter than the light crossing time
of the AGN's supermassive black hole). We propose that ultrafast variability is
a byproduct of the turbulent dissipation of the jet Poynting flux. Due to the
intermittency of the turbulent cascade, the dissipation is concentrated in a
set of reconnecting current sheets. Electrons energised by reconnection have a
strong pitch angle anisotropy, i.e. their velocity is nearly aligned with the
guide magnetic field. Then each current sheet produces a narrow radiation beam,
which dominates the emission from the whole jet when it is directed towards the
observer. The ultrafast variability is set by the light crossing time of a
single current sheet, which is much shorter than the light crossing time of the
whole emission region. The predictions of our model are: (i) The bolometric
luminosity of ultrafast AGN flares is dominated by the inverse Compton (IC)
emission, as the lower energy synchrotron emission is suppressed due to the
pitch angle anisotropy. (ii) If the observed luminosity includes a non-flaring
component, the variations of the synchrotron luminosity have a small amplitude.
(iii) The synchrotron and IC emission are less variable at lower frequencies,
as the cooling time of the radiating particles exceeds the light crossing time
of the current sheet. Simultaneous multiwavelength observations of ultrafast
AGN flares can test these predictions.

scheme that works on 3D point clouds. Specifically, we propose a 3D model/point
cloud alignment method, which works by finding a global transformation between
reference and target point clouds using spectral analysis. A 3D Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) in R3 is used for the translation estimation, and the real
spherical harmonics in SO(3) are used for the rotations estimation. Such an
approach allows us to derive a decoupled 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) controller,
where we use gradient ascent optimisation to minimise translation and
rotational costs. We then show how this methodology can be used to regulate a
robot arm to perform a positioning task. In contrast to the existing
state-of-the-art depth-based visual servoing methods that either require dense
depth maps or dense point clouds, our method works well with partial point
clouds and can effectively handle larger transformations between the reference
and the target positions. Furthermore, the use of spectral data (instead of
spatial data) for transformation estimation makes our method robust to
sensor-induced noise and partial occlusions. We validate our approach by
performing experiments using point clouds acquired by a robot-mounted depth
camera. Obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of our visual servoing
approach.

popularitydue to its importance in many real-world applications, such as
autonomous driving, robot perception, and remote sensing. However, previous
methods have either produced unsatisfactory results or relied on complex
systems and paradigms. We wonder if there is a simple way to obtain
state-of-the-art results. Fortunately, we have identified two observations that
help us achieve the best of both worlds: 1) query-based methods demonstrate
superiority over dense proposal-based methods in open-world instance
segmentation, and 2) learning localization cues is sufficient for open world
instance segmentation. Based on these observations, we propose a simple
query-based method named OpenInst for open world instance segmentation.
OpenInst leverages advanced query-based methods like QueryInst and focuses on
learning localization cues. Notably, OpenInst is an extremely simple and
straightforward framework without any auxiliary modules or post-processing, yet
achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks. Specifically, in the
COCO$\to$UVO scenario, OpenInst achieves a mask AR of 53.3, outperforming the
previous best methods by 2.0 AR with a simpler structure. We hope that OpenInst

multi-layer fingerprinting framework that jointly considers the multi-layer

straightforward derivations. In solving the formulated problem, we obtain a
tight surrogate bound using variational inference for efficient optimization.
In extracting the shared device information, we develop an algorithm based on
the Wyner common information method, enjoying reduced computation complexity as
compared to existing approaches. The algorithm can be applied to data
distributions belonging to the exponential family class. Empirically, we
evaluate the algorithm in a synthetic dataset with real-world video traffic and

such a challenge, this paper proposes an array of viable heuristics of the
decision-making that drives those restoration campaigns. To examine their
applicability and measure their performance, those heuristics have been applied
to two real-work DCNs that consists of 100 listed Chinese A-share companies,

understand the physical conditions of plasma around compact objects and to
explore its emitting properties. This has become increasingly important in
recent years in the light of the Event Horizon Telescope observations of Sgr A*
and M87. Models of thick discs around black holes usually consider constant
angular momentum distributions and do not take into account the magnetic
response of the fluid to applied magnetic fields. We present a generalisation
of our previous work on stationary models of magnetised accretion discs with
magnetic polarisation (Pimentel et al. 2018). This extension is achieved by
accounting for non-constant specific angular momentum profiles, done through a
two-parameter ansatz for those distributions. We build a large number of new
equilibrium solutions of thick discs with magnetic polarisation around Kerr
black holes, selecting suitable parameter values within the intrinsically
substantial parameter space of the models. We study the morphology and the
physical properties of those solutions, finding qualitative changes with
respect to the constant angular momentum tori of (Pimentel et al. 2018).
However, the dependences found on the angular momentum distribution or on the
black hole spin do not seem to be strong. Some of the new solutions, however,
exhibit a local maximum of the magnetisation function, absent in standard
magnetised tori. Due to the enhanced development of the magneto-rotational
instability as a result of magnetic susceptibility, those models might be
particularly well-suited to investigate jet formation through
general-relativistic MHD simulations. The new equilibrium solutions reported
here can be used as initial data in numerical codes to assess the impact of
magnetic susceptibility in the dynamics and observational properties of thick
disc-black hole systems.

graph spaces along Schr\""odinger bridges at zero temperature, according to the
definition given by the second named author in [31], in the continuity of the
work by C. L\'eonard [19] inspired by the Lott-Sturm-Villani theory. A graph
space is defined as a quadruple $(\mathcal{X},d,L,m)$ where $\mathcal{X}$ is
the set of vertices, $d$ is the combinatorial distance and $m$ is a reversible
reference measure with respect to a generator $L$ of a Markov semi-group on
$\mathcal{X}$. The criteria are given by local optimization problems on balls
of radius two, depending only on the generator $L$ and on the discrete
structure of these balls. General tensorization properties of the criteria are
presented for the study of the Cartesian product of graphs. This approach is
robust since it applies to a wide range of graph spaces and also for any
measure $m$, including measures with interaction potential like Ising models.
We introduce a very large class of structured graphs, for which the local
criteria give non-negative entropic curvature for the uniform measure. A
Bonnet-Myers type of theorem also ensures that any such graph with positive
entropic curvature is finite. On any graph space, positive entropic curvature
provides transport-entropy inequalities with so-called weak optimal transport
costs, as well as Poincar\'e or modified log-Sobolev inequalities for the
renormalized probability measure $\mu = m/m(\mathcal{X})$. These inequalities
are related to refined concentration properties of the measure $\mu$, speed of
convergence of semi-groups to the measure $\mu$. We also present examples of
graphs with negative curvature. Some comparisons of our results with other

The model suggests a characteristic variation of the degree of polarization
across the region of spectral dip and the peak of Fano resonance as an
exclusive signature of the connection between the degree of polarization and
the coherence of the interfering modes. The predictions of the model is
experimentally verified in the partially polarized Fano resonance spectra from

We show that the standard fixed-point iteration achieves a $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$

fixed-point residual converging to the infimal displacement vector, while the
accelerated fixed-point iteration achieves $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and

an example of tilted magnetic anisotropy. The 6-monolayer (111) film (about

in-plane easy magnetization axis in a unique L1$_0$ tetragonal direction. This
is an unusual type of in-plane anisotropy, as the particular direction

interconnection of multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems via metro optical

popular tool for creating specialized virtual networks. However, resource
fragmentation caused by uneven utilization of multidimensional resources can
lead to reduced utilization of limited edge resources. To tackle this issue,
this paper focuses on addressing the multidimensional resource fragmentation
problem in virtual network embedding (VNE) in MEC systems with the aim of
maximizing the profit of an infrastructure provider (InP). The VNE problem in
MEC systems is transformed into a bilevel optimization problem, taking into
account the interdependence between virtual node embedding (VNoE) and virtual
link embedding (VLiE). To solve this problem, we propose a nested bilevel
optimization approach named BiVNE. The VNoE is solved using the ant colony
system (ACS) in the upper level, while the VLiE is solved using a combination
of a shortest path algorithm and an exact-fit spectrum slot allocation method
in the lower level. Evaluation results show that the BiVNE algorithm can
effectively enhance the profit of the InP by increasing the acceptance ratio
and avoiding resource fragmentation simultaneously.

signal from its Fourier intensity measurements, has attracted significant
interest because of its far-flung applications in optical imaging. To enhance
accuracy, researchers introduce extra constraints to the measuring procedure by
including a random aperture mask in the optical path that randomly modulates
the light projected on the target object and gives the coded diffraction
patterns (CDP). It is known that random masks are non-bandlimited and can lead
to considerable high-frequency components in the Fourier intensity
measurements. These high-frequency components can be beyond the Nyquist
frequency of the optical system and are thus ignored by the phase retrieval
optimization algorithms, resulting in degraded reconstruction performances.
Recently, our team developed a binary green noise masking scheme that can
significantly reduce the high-frequency components in the measurement. However,
the scheme cannot be extended to generate multiple-level aperture masks. This
paper proposes a two-stage optimization algorithm to generate multi-level
random masks named $\textit{OptMask}$ that can also significantly reduce
high-frequency components in the measurements but achieve higher accuracy than
the binary masking scheme. Extensive experiments on a practical optical
platform were conducted. The results demonstrate the superiority and

flares, which are explained as being a result of a secondary supermassive black
hole (SMBH) impacting the accretion disc of a more massive primary SMBH in a
binary system. The accretion disc is not rigid but rather bends in a calculable
way due to the tidal influence of the secondary. Below we refer to this
phenomenon as a variable disc level. We begin by showing that these flares
occur at times predicted by a simple analytical formula, based on general
relativity inspired modified Kepler equation, which explains impact flares
since 1888.
  The 2022 impact flare, namely flare number 26, is rather peculiar as it
breaks the typical pattern of two impact flares per 12-year cycle. This is the
third bremsstrahlung flare of the current cycle that follows the already
observed 2015 and 2019 impact flares from OJ~287.
  It turns out that the arrival epoch of flare number 26 is sensitive to the
level of primary SMBH's accretion disc relative to its mean level in our model.
We incorporate these tidally induced changes in the level of the accretion disc
to infer that the thermal flare should have occurred during July-August 2022,
when it was not possible to observe it from the Earth. Thereafter, we explore
possible observational evidence for certain pre-flare activity by employing
spectral and polarimetric data from our campaigns in 2004/05 and 2021/22. We
point out theoretical and observational implications of two observed

efficiency between such a design and an optimal design for the true model in

discrimination and parameter estimation are discussed and the methodology is

this scenario. We propose Data-Agnostic Consolidation (DAC), a novel double

paradigm when the dark matter is made of weakly interacting massive particles
of mass $100\ \mathrm{GeV}$. In particular, we complement previous studies by
exploring the MAHs of haloes with mass from $10^8\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$
down to Earth mass, $10^{-6}\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The formation redshift
of low-mass haloes anti-correlates weakly with mass, peaking at $z=3$ for
haloes of mass $10^{-4}\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Even lower masses are
affected by the free-streaming cutoff in the primordial spectrum of density
fluctuations and form at lower redshift. We compare MAHs in our simulations
with predictions from two analytical models based on the extended
Press-Schechter theory (EPS), and three empirical models derived by fitting and
extrapolating either results from cosmological $N$-body simulations or Monte
Carlo realizations of halo growth. All models fit our simulations reasonably
well over the mass range for which they were calibrated. While the empirical
models match better for more massive haloes, $M>10^{10}\
h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, the analytical models do better when extrapolated
down to Earth mass. At the higher masses, we explore the correlation between
local environment density and MAH, finding that biases are relatively weak,
with typical MAHs for haloes in extremely low-density and in typical regions
differing by less than $20$ percent at high redshift. We conclude that EPS
theory predicts the hierarchical build-up of dark matter haloes quite well over

optimization problem and then map the solutions to a higher-dimensional case.
For a use case to design buildings that minimize wind nuisance, we show that we
can predict flow features around 3D buildings from 2D flow features around
building footprints. For a diverse set of building designs, by sampling the
space of 2D footprints with a quality diversity algorithm, a predictive model
can be trained that is more accurate than when trained on a set of footprints
that were selected with a space-filling algorithm like the Sobol sequence.
Simulating only 16 buildings in 3D, a set of 1024 building designs with low
predicted wind nuisance is created. We show that we can produce better machine
learning models by producing training data with quality diversity instead of
using common sampling techniques. The method can bootstrap generative design in
a computationally expensive 3D domain and allow engineers to sweep the design
space, understanding wind nuisance in early design phases.

spaces. However, we show that in 4d theories with a scalar potential growing
fast enough at infinity, it is energetically too costly for scalars to diverge
at the core, and the small black hole puffs up into a regular black hole, or
follows a runaway behaviour.
  We derive a critical exponent characterizing the occurrence or not of such
small black hole explosions, both from a 4d perspective, and in the 2d theory
after an $\bf{S}^2$ truncation. The latter setup allows a unified discussion of
fluxes, domain walls and black holes, solving an apparent puzzle in the
expression of their potentials in the 4d $\cal{N}=2$ gauged supergravity
context.
  We discuss the realization of these ideas in 4d $\cal{N}=2$ gauged
supergravities. Along the way we show that many regular black hole supergravity
solutions in the literature in the latter context are incomplete, due to
Freed-Witten anomalies (or duals thereof), and require the emission of strings
by the black hole.
  From the 2d perspective, small black hole solutions correspond to dynamical
cobordisms, with the core describing an end of the world brane. Small black
hole explosions represent obstructions to completing the dynamical cobordism.
We study the implications for the Cobordism Distance Conjecture, which states
that in any theory there should exist dynamical cobordisms accessing all
possible infinite distance limits in scalar field space. The realization of
this principle using small black holes leads to non-trivial constraints on the
4d scalar potential of any consistent theory; in the 4d $\cal{N}=2$ context,
they allow to recover from a purely bottom-up perspective, several non-trivial
properties of vector moduli spaces near infinity familiar from CY$_3$

constraints in videos by introducing the Temporal KNN-patch Loss (TK-Loss),
providing strong mask supervision without any labels. Our TK-Loss finds
one-to-many matches across frames, through an efficient patch-matching step
followed by a K-nearest neighbor selection. A consistency loss is then enforced
on the found matches. Our mask-free objective is simple to implement, has no
trainable parameters, is computationally efficient, yet outperforms baselines
employing, e.g., state-of-the-art optical flow to enforce temporal mask
consistency. We validate MaskFreeVIS on the YouTube-VIS 2019/2021, OVIS and

The real spectrum appears in the $\Gamma$Y direction and has been validated as
the complex conjugate medium (CCM) by effective medium theory (EMT). But for
the $\Gamma$X direction, EMT indicates that the effective refractive index has
a large imaginary part, which forms an evanescent wave inside the PCs. Thence,
coherent perfect absorber (CPA) and laser effects can be achieved in the
directional emission of the $\Gamma$Y. The outgoing wave in the $\Gamma$X
direction is weak, which can significantly reduce the losses and
electromagnetic interference caused by the leakage waves. Furthermore, the
non-Hermitian PCs enable many fascinating applications such as signal
amplification, collimation, and angle sensors.

short-time and long-time dynamic. By using the generalized Kirchhoff equations
to describe the particle motion, we demonstrate that during the very short
dynamic regime, a cylinder starting from rest behaves with sedimenting
velocities and angular velocity proportional to $t$ and $t^3$, respectively. We
then explore the long-time behaviour and evaluate the validity of the
quasi-steady assumption under which the fluid unsteady term can be neglected.
Using a dimensional analysis, we establish that the quasi-steady assumption is
only applicable to Reynolds numbers much smaller than one. However, by
comparing the results of quasi-steady models to recent experiments and direct
numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this assumption is valid for a
broader range of Reynolds numbers, particularly for long fibres. We also
analyze the effect of particle inertia. We show particle inertia plays no
significant role in the magnitude of the sedimenting velocities and angular
velocity. However, for sufficiently large inertia we reveal that the
quasi-steady model takes the form of a damped oscillator when the particle
approaches its equilibrium position, which is broadside on to its direction of
motion. We discuss the relevance of this solution in light of direct numerical
simulations.

  function","62 pages, 8 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo method that
allows to sample high dimensional probability measures. It relies on the
integration of the Hamiltonian dynamics to propose a move which is then
accepted or rejected thanks to a Metropolis procedure. Unbiased sampling is
guaranteed by the preservation by the numerical integrators of two key
properties of the Hamiltonian dynamics: volume-preservation and reversibility
up to momentum reversal. For separable Hamiltonian functions, some standard
explicit numerical schemes, such as the St\""ormer--Verlet integrator, satisfy
these properties. However, for numerical or physical reasons, one may consider
a Hamiltonian function which is nonseparable, in which case the standard
numerical schemes which preserve the volume and satisfy reversibility up to
momentum reversal are implicit. Actually, when implemented in practice, such
implicit schemes may admit many solutions or none, especially when the timestep
is too large. We show here how to enforce the numerical reversibility, and thus
unbiasedness, of HMC schemes in this context. Numerical results illustrate the
relevance of this correction on simple problems.

However, current HNNs in computer vision rely on Euclidean backbones and only
project features to the hyperbolic space in the task heads, limiting their
ability to fully leverage the benefits of hyperbolic geometry. To address this,
we present HCNN, the first fully hyperbolic convolutional neural network (CNN)
designed for computer vision tasks. Based on the Lorentz model, we generalize
fundamental components of CNNs and propose novel formulations of the
convolutional layer, batch normalization, and multinomial logistic regression.
Experimentation on standard vision tasks demonstrates the superiority of our
HCNN framework and the Lorentz model in both hybrid and fully hyperbolic

developing more powerful HNNs that can better represent complex structures

behaviour at horizons of black holes. It stems from the inability to
unambiguously impose ingoing boundary conditions at the horizon at an infinite
discrete set of Fourier modes. The phenomenon has been best understood, when
such a description exists, in terms of dual holographic (AdS/CFT) correlation
function that take the value of `$0/0$' at these special points. In this work,
we investigate details of pole-skipping purely from the point of view of
classical gravity in 4$d$ massive black hole geometries with flat, spherical
and hyperbolic horizons, and with an arbitrary cosmological constant. We show
that pole-skipping points naturally fall into two categories: the algebraically
special points and a set of pole-skipping points that is common to the even and
odd channels of perturbations. Our analysis utilises and generalises (to
arbitrary maximally symmetric horizon topology and cosmological constant) the
`integrable' structure of the Darboux transformations, which relate the master
field equations that describe the evolution of gravitational perturbations in
the two channels. Finally, we provide new insights into a number of special
cases: spherical black holes, asymptotically Anti-de Sitter black branes and
pole-skipping at the cosmological horizon in de Sitter space.

in the design and control of magnetic response phenomena. In this work, we
demonstrate through hole doping of a high entropy perovskite oxide that tuning
of magnetic responses can be achieved. With detailed magnetometry, we show
magnetic coupling exhibiting a variety of magnetic responses including exchange
bias and antiferromagnetic spin reversal in the entropy stabilized ABO3
perovskite oxide La1-xSrx(Cr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2)O3 family. We find that
manipulation of the A-site charge state can be used to balance magnetic phase
compositions and coupling responses. This allows for the creation of highly
tunable exchange bias responses. In the low Sr doping regime, a spin frustrated
region arising at the antiferromagnetic phase boundary is shown to directly
couple to the antiferromagnetic moments of the film and emerges as the dominant
mechanism, leading to a vertical shift of magnetization loops in response to
field biasing. At higher concentrations, direct coupling of antiferromagnetic
and ferromagnetic regions is observed. This tunability of magnetic coupling is
discussed within the context of these three competing magnetic phases,
revealing critical features in designing exchange bias through exploiting spin

(TDI) variables for detecting and reconstructing Stochastic Gravitational Wave
Background (SGWB) signals and estimating the instrumental noise in LISA. Most
works in the literature build their data analysis pipelines relying on a
particular set of TDI channels, the so-called AET variables, which are
orthogonal under idealized conditions. By relaxing the assumption of a
perfectly equilateral LISA configuration, we investigate to which degree these
channels remain orthogonal and compare them to other TDI channels. We show that
different sets of TDI variables are more robust under perturbations of the
perfect equilateral configuration, better preserving their orthogonality and,
thus, leading to a more accurate estimate of the instrumental noise. Moreover,
we investigate the impact of considering the noise levels associated with each
instrumental noise source to be independent of one another, generalizing the
analysis from two to twelve noise parameters. We find that, in this scenario,
the assumption of orthogonality is broken for all the TDI variables, leading to
a misestimation of measurement error for some of the noise parameters.
Remarkably, we find that for a flat power-law signal, the reconstruction of the
signal parameters is nearly unaffected in these various configurations.

quantum interference and many-body effects at low temperatures. For a periodic
driving, the analysis of the full counting statistics revealed the elementary
events that determine the statistical properties of the charge transport. As a
result, the noise correlations display quantum oscillation as functions of the
ratio of the voltage amplitude and the drive frequency reflecting the detailed
shape of the drive. However, so far only continuous wave excitations were
considered, but recently transport by few-cycle light pulses were investigated
and the need for a statistical interpretation became eminent. We address the
charge transfer generated by single- or few-cycle light pulses. The
fingerprints of these time-dependent voltage pulses are imprinted in the full
counting statistics of a coherent mesoscopic conductor at zero temperature. In
addition, we identify the elementary processes that occur in the form of
electron-hole pair creations, which can be investigated by the excess noise. We
study the quantum oscillations in the differential noise induced by a wave
packet consisting of an oscillating carrier modulated by a Gaussian- or a
box-shaped envelope. As expected, the differential noise exhibits an
oscillatory behavior with increasing amplitude. In particular, we find clear
signature of the so-called carrier-envelope phase in the peak heights and
positions of these quantum oscillations. More carrier cycles under the Gaussian
envelope diminish the influence of the carrier-envelope phase, while this is
not true for the box pulses, probably related to the abrupt onset. As the
quantum oscillations are due to the energy-time uncertainty of the short
pulses, our results pave the way to a description of the nonequilibrium
electron transport in terms of a many-body Wigner function of the electronic

  driven approach",,,,,"astro-ph.HE cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  HERMES (High Energy Rapid Modular Ensemble of Satellites) pathfinder is an
in-orbit demonstration consisting of a constellation of six 3U nano-satellites
hosting simple but innovative detectors for the monitoring of cosmic
high-energy transients. The main objective of HERMES Pathfinder is to prove
that accurate position of high-energy cosmic transients can be obtained using
miniaturized hardware. The transient position is obtained by studying the delay
time of arrival of the signal to different detectors hosted by nano-satellites
on low Earth orbits. To this purpose, the goal is to achive an overall accuracy
of a fraction of a micro-second. In this context, we need to develop novel
tools to fully exploit the future scientific data output of HERMES Pathfinder.
In this paper, we introduce a new framework to assess the background count rate
of a space-born, high energy detector; a key step towards the identification of
faint astrophysical transients. We employ a Neural Network (NN) to estimate the
background lightcurves on different timescales. Subsequently, we employ a fast
change-point and anomaly detection technique to isolate observation segments
where statistically significant excesses in the observed count rate relative to
the background estimate exist. We test the new software on archival data from
the NASA Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), which has a collecting area and
background level of the same order of magnitude to those of HERMES Pathfinder.
The NN performances are discussed and analyzed over period of both high and low
solar activity. We were able to confirm events in the Fermi/GBM catalog and
found events, not present in Fermi/GBM database, that could be attributed to
Solar Flares, Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes, Gamma-Ray Bursts, Galactic X-ray
flash. Seven of these are selected and analyzed further, providing an estimate
of localisation and a tentative classification.

practical applications, e.g., poster designs, the canvas is originally
non-empty, and both inter-element relationships as well as inter-layer
relationships should be concerned when generating a proper layout. A few recent
works deal with them simultaneously, but they still suffer from poor graphic
performance, such as a lack of layout variety or spatial non-alignment. Since
content-aware visual-textual presentation layout is a novel task, we first
construct a new dataset named PosterLayout, which consists of 9,974
poster-layout pairs and 905 images, i.e., non-empty canvases. It is more
challenging and useful for greater layout variety, domain diversity, and
content diversity. Then, we propose design sequence formation (DSF) that
reorganizes elements in layouts to imitate the design processes of human

discriminator is design-sequence-aware and will supervise the ""design"" process

methods for steady states of dynamical systems, we propose to {iteratively}
train a number of neural networks to minimize a regularized loss function
accounting for the necessity of conserved quantities to be {\it in involution}
and enforcing functional independence thereof consistently in the
infinite-sample limit. The method is applied to a series of integrable and
non-integrable lattice differential-difference equations. In the former, the
predicted number of conservation laws extensively grows with the number of
degrees of freedom, while for the latter, it generically stops at a threshold
related to the number of conserved quantities in the system. This data-driven
tool could prove valuable in assessing a model's conserved quantities and its
potential integrability.

its noteworthy use in day-to-day life. This advancement has led to an increase
in the data collection of electrophysiological signals. Due to this
advancement, electrocardiogram (ECG) signal monitoring has become a leading
task in the medical field. ECG plays an important role in the medical field by
analysing cardiac physiology and abnormalities. However, these signals are
affected due to numerous varieties of noises, such as electrode motion,
baseline wander and white noise etc., which affects the diagnosis accuracy.
Therefore, filtering ECG signals became an important task. Currently, deep
learning schemes are widely employed in signal-filtering tasks due to their
efficient architecture of feature learning. This work presents a deep
learning-based scheme for ECG signal filtering, which is based on the deep
autoencoder module. According to this scheme, the data is processed through the
encoder and decoder layer to reconstruct by eliminating noises. The proposed
deep learning architecture uses a modified ReLU function to improve the
learning of attributes because standard ReLU cannot adapt to huge variations.
Further, a skip connection is also incorporated in the proposed architecture,
which retains the key feature of the encoder layer while mapping these features
to the decoder layer. Similarly, an attention model is also included, which
performs channel and spatial attention, which generates the robust map by using
channel and average pooling operations, resulting in improving the learning
performance. The proposed approach is tested on a publicly available MIT-BIH
dataset where different types of noise, such as electrode motion, baseline
water and motion artifacts, are added to the original signal at varied SNR
levels.

  Modulation of MoS2 upon Lithium-Ion Intercalation",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In recent times photorechargeable metal ion batteries have garnered
significant attention but the atomistic details of the mechanism of the
charging process is still unknown. MoS2/MoOy, a type II semiconductor
heterostructure, has been shown to function as photocathode where during
discharge the lithium ion (Li-ion) intercalation happens mostly in MoS2 layers.
Photoexposure leads to exciton formation and the type II set-up is supposed to
generate spatially separated and longer-lived charge carriers. The Li
intercalated MoS2 is known to undergo a phase transition from the
semiconducting (2H) to a metallic (1T') phase. Hence, the proposal of exciton
formation and its separation in LixMoS2 during photocharging needs closer
inspection. In this study, with the help of density functional theory (DFT)
based studies that is aptly supported by experimental data, it is shown that
LixMoS2/MoO3 forms a type II heterostructure where the underlying band gap of
LixMoS2 is exposed due to dispersion of electron density onto MoO3 upto a
certain value of x. Further studies show that the type II arrangement is lost
prior to the phase transition. In order to investigate the electronic structure
and the phase transition upon lithiation in the explicit heterostructure, we
introduced two unconventional computational schemes. The presence of the band
gap and the ensuing type II arrangement in LixMoS2/MoO3 upto a certain
concentration of the intercalated Li-ion justifies the possibility of the
photocharging process. We believe that the general concepts explored in this
study will be important in the rational design of type II heterostructures that
can behave as photo-cathode materials in Li-ion batteries.

first pulsating extremely low-mass white dwarf that shows rotational splittings
within its periodogram. We assess the theoretical frequency splittings expected
for different rotation profiles and compare them to the observed frequency
splittings of GD 278. To this aim, we employ an asteroseismological model
representative of the pulsations of this star, obtained by using the LPCODE
stellar evolution code. We also derive a rotation profile that results from
detailed evolutionary calculations carried out with the MESA stellar evolution
code and use it to infer the expected theoretical frequency splittings. We
found that the best-fitting solution when assuming linear profiles for the
rotation of GD 278 leads to values of the angular velocity at the surface and
the center that are only slightly differential, and still compatible with rigid
rotation. The values of the angular velocity at the surface and the center for
the simple linear rotation profiles and for the rotation profile derived from
evolutionary calculations are in very good agreement. Also, the resulting
theoretical frequency splittings are compatible with the observed frequency
splittings, in general, for both cases. The results obtained from the different
approaches followed in this work to derive the internal rotation of GD 278
agree. The fact that they were obtained employing two independent stellar
evolution codes gives robustness to our results. Our results suggest only a
marginally differential behavior for the internal rotation in GD 278, and
considering the uncertainties involved, very compatible with the rigid case, as
has been observed previously for white dwarfs and pre-white dwarfs. The
rotation periods derived for this star are also in line with the values
determined asteroseismologically for white dwarfs and pre-white dwarfs in
general.

labels are unable to reliably describe the complexity and variability of
several clinical phenotypes. This is particularly true for a broad range of
neuropsychiatric illnesses (e.g., depression, anxiety disorders, behavioral
phenotypes). Patient heterogeneity can be better described by grouping
individuals into novel categories based on empirically derived sections of
intersecting continua that span across and beyond traditional categorical
borders. In this context, neuroimaging data carry a wealth of spatiotemporally
resolved information about each patient's brain. However, they are usually
heavily collapsed a priori through procedures which are not learned as part of
model training, and consequently not optimized for the downstream prediction
task. This is because every individual participant usually comes with multiple
whole-brain 3D imaging modalities often accompanied by a deep genotypic and
phenotypic characterization, hence posing formidable computational challenges.
In this paper we design a deep learning architecture based on generative models
rooted in a modular approach and separable convolutional blocks to a) fuse
multiple 3D neuroimaging modalities on a voxel-wise level, b) convert them into
informative latent embeddings through heavy dimensionality reduction, c)
maintain good generalizability and minimal information loss. As proof of
concept, we test our architecture on the well characterized Human Connectome
Project database demonstrating that our latent embeddings can be clustered into
easily separable subject strata which, in turn, map to different phenotypical
information which was not included in the embedding creation process. This may
be of aid in predicting disease evolution as well as drug response, hence
supporting mechanistic disease understanding and empowering clinical trials.

it is vital to be able to combine data across scanners and studies. However,
different MRI scanners produce images with different characteristics, resulting
in a domain shift known as the `harmonisation problem'. Additionally,
neuroimaging data is inherently personal in nature, leading to data privacy
concerns when sharing the data. To overcome these barriers, we propose an
Unsupervised Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) method, SFHarmony. Through
modelling the imaging features as a Gaussian Mixture Model and minimising an
adapted Bhattacharyya distance between the source and target features, we can
create a model that performs well for the target data whilst having a shared
feature representation across the data domains, without needing access to the
source data for adaptation or target labels. We demonstrate the performance of
our method on simulated and real domain shifts, showing that the approach is
applicable to classification, segmentation and regression tasks, requiring no
changes to the algorithm. Our method outperforms existing SFDA approaches
across a range of realistic data scenarios, demonstrating the potential utility
of our approach for MRI harmonisation and general SFDA problems. Our code is

to the complex configuration space and expensive performance evaluation. Most
existing approaches follow a two-phase process, first learning a
regression-based performance prediction model on available samples and then
searching for the configurations with satisfactory performance using the
learned model. Such regression-based models often suffer from the scarcity of
samples due to the enormous time and resources required to run a large software
system with a specific configuration. Moreover, previous studies have shown
that even a highly accurate regression-based model may fail to discern the
relative merit between two configurations, whereas performance comparison is
actually one fundamental strategy for configuration tuning. To address these
issues, this paper proposes CM-CASL, a Comparison-based performance Modeling
approach for software systems via Collaborative Active and Semisupervised
Learning. CM-CASL learns a classification model that compares the performance
of two given configurations, and enhances the samples through a collaborative
labeling process by both human experts and classifiers using an integration of
active and semisupervised learning. Experimental results demonstrate that
CM-CASL outperforms two state-of-the-art performance modeling approaches in
terms of both classification accuracy and rank accuracy, and thus provides a
better performance model for the subsequent work of configuration tuning.

machine learning approach based on the range corrected deep potential (DPRc)
model to improve computing efficiency. The approach was applied to computing
\ch{C=O} stretching vibrational frequency shifts of formic acid-water solution.
DPRc is adapted for frequency shift calculation. The system was divided into
``probe region'' and ``solvent region'' by atom. Three kinds of ``probe
region'' were tested: single atom with atomic contribution correction, a single
atom, and a single molecule. All data sets were prepared using by Quantum
Vibration Perturbation (QVP) approach. The deep potential (DP) model was also
adapted for frequency shift calculation for comparison, and different
interaction cut-off radii were tested. The single molecule ``probe region''
results show the best accuracy, running roughly ten times faster than regular
DP, while reducing the training time by a factor of about four, making it fully
applicable in practice. The results show that dropping information of
interaction distances between solvent atoms can significantly increase
computing and training efficiency while ensuring little loss of accuracy. The
protocol is practical, easy to apply, and extendable to calculating other
physical quantities.

together, have enabled robots to complete a range of complex and highly
variable tasks. Existing work primarily focuses on one human sharing autonomy
with a single robot. By contrast, in this paper we present an approach for
multi-robot shared autonomy that enables one operator to provide real-time
corrections across two coordinated robots completing the same task in parallel.
Sharing autonomy with multiple robots presents fundamental challenges. The
human can only correct one robot at a time, and without coordination, the human
may be left idle for long periods of time. Accordingly, we develop an approach
that aligns the robot's learned motions to best utilize the human's expertise.
Our key idea is to leverage Learning from Demonstration (LfD) and time warping
to schedule the motions of the robots based on when they may require
assistance. Our method uses variability in operator demonstrations to identify
the types of corrections an operator might apply during shared autonomy,
leverages flexibility in how quickly the task was performed in demonstrations
to aid in scheduling, and iteratively estimates the likelihood of when
corrections may be needed to ensure that only one robot is completing an action
requiring assistance. Through a preliminary simulated study, we show that our
method can decrease the overall time spent sanding by iteratively estimating
the times when each robot could need assistance and generating an optimized
schedule that allows the operator to provide corrections to each robot during
these times.

We find that coin disorder alters the usual ballistic transport properties of

strong evidence for localization behavior. We investigate this slow dynamics by
comparing different properties of the walker occupation probability with the
standard Hadamard walk. We find that the walker distribution, and a number of
properties associated with it, are significantly altered by the coin disorder.
Special focus is given to the influence of coin disorder on entanglement

coin-walker entanglement. The behavior of the entanglement properties further
supports the premise that coin disorder induces localization in coined quantum
walks.

dominated by Fe ix and Fe x emission at about 1 MK. We study the thermal
properties of EUI brightening events by simultaneously observing their
responses at different wavelengths using spectral data from the Spectral
Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) also on board Solar Orbiter and
imaging data from EUI. We studied three EUI brightenings that were identified
in HRIEUV data that lie within the small areas covered by the slit of the SPICE
EUV spectrometer. We obtained the line intensities of the spectral profiles by
Gaussian fitting. These diagnostics were used to study the evolution of the EUI
brightenings over time at the different line-formation temperatures. We find
that (i) the detection of these EUI brightenings is at the limit of the SPICE
capabilities. They could not have been independently identified in the data
without the aid of HRIEUV observations. (ii) Two of these EUI brightenings with
longer lifetimes are observed up to Ne viii temperatures (0.6 MK). (iii) All of
the events are detectable in O vi (0.3 MK), and the two longer-lived events are
also detected in other transition region (TR) lines. (iv) In one case, we
observe two peaks in the intensity light curve of the TR lines that are
separated by 2.7 min for C iii and 1.2 min for O vi. The Ne viii intensity
shows a single peak between the two peak times of the TR line intensity.

  Scene Graph Generation",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Panoptic Scene Graph generation (PSG) is a recently proposed task in image
scene understanding that aims to segment the image and extract triplets of
subjects, objects and their relations to build a scene graph. This task is
particularly challenging for two reasons. First, it suffers from a long-tail
problem in its relation categories, making naive biased methods more inclined
to high-frequency relations. Existing unbiased methods tackle the long-tail
problem by data/loss rebalancing to favor low-frequency relations. Second, a
subject-object pair can have two or more semantically overlapping relations.
While existing methods favor one over the other, our proposed HiLo framework
lets different network branches specialize on low and high frequency relations,
enforce their consistency and fuse the results. To the best of our knowledge we
are the first to propose an explicitly unbiased PSG method. In extensive
experiments we show that our HiLo framework achieves state-of-the-art results
on the PSG task. We also apply our method to the Scene Graph Generation task
that predicts boxes instead of masks and see improvements over all baseline
methods.

magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. This event exhibits a double-deflection that
has been reported and analyzed in previous works but whose underlying cause

against the magnetic gradients. Using a high-cadence, full trajectory

find a pseudostreamer (PS) structure whose null point may be responsible for
the complex evolution of the MFR at the initial phase. From the pre-eruptive
magnetic field reconstruction, we estimate the dynamic forces acting on the MFR

simulation we are able to reproduce the observed behavior, confirming the
importance of the PS null point. We find that the magnetic forces directed

CH. Later, the magnetic pressure gradient of the CH produces the reversal

improvements in the initial preprocessing of the input image with an impact on
the final error. Several models are proposed and analyzed to retain the best

often assume that the observed sequences are complete while ignoring the
potential for missing values caused by object occlusion, scope limitation,
sensor failure, etc. This limitation inevitably hinders the accuracy of
trajectory prediction. To address this issue, our paper presents a unified
framework, the Graph-based Conditional Variational Recurrent Neural Network
(GC-VRNN), which can perform trajectory imputation and prediction
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a novel Multi-Space Graph Neural
Network (MS-GNN) that can extract spatial features from incomplete observations
and leverage missing patterns. Additionally, we employ a Conditional VRNN with
a specifically designed Temporal Decay (TD) module to capture temporal
dependencies and temporal missing patterns in incomplete trajectories. The
inclusion of the TD module allows for valuable information to be conveyed
through the temporal flow. We also curate and benchmark three practical
datasets for the joint problem of trajectory imputation and prediction.
Extensive experiments verify the exceptional performance of our proposed

benchmarks and techniques for trajectory imputation and prediction in a unified

radial electric field $E_r$ in the tokamak edge, as well as edge momentum
transport and toroidal rotation. To quantitatively measure ion orbit loss, an
orbit-flux formulation has been developed and numerically applied to the
gyrokinetic particle-in-cell code XGC. We study collisional ion orbit loss in
an axisymmetric DIII-D L-mode plasma using gyrokinetic ions and drift-kinetic
electrons. Numerical simulations, where the plasma density and temperature
profiles are maintained through neutral ionization and heating, show the
formation of a quasisteady negative $E_r$ in the edge. We have measured a
radially outgoing ion gyrocenter flux due to collisional scattering of ions
into the loss orbits, which is balanced by the radially incoming ion gyrocenter
flux from confined orbits on the collisional time scale. This suggests that
collisional ion orbit loss can shift $E_r$ in the negative direction compared
to that in plasmas without orbit loss. It is also found that collisional ion
orbit loss can contribute to a radially outgoing (counter-current)
toroidal-angular-momentum flux, which is not balanced by the
toroidal-angular-momentum flux carried by ions on the confined orbits.
Therefore, the edge toroidal rotation shifts in the co-current direction on the

absolute difference, ratio, odds ratio, number needed to treat, and so on. The
choice of a measure, eg absolute versus relative, is often debated because it
leads to different appreciations of the same phenomenon; but it also implies
different heterogeneity of treatment effect. In addition some measures -- but
not all -- have appealing properties such as collapsibility, matching the
intuition of a population summary. We review common measures and their pros and

Our main contribution is to propose to reverse the thinking: rather than
starting from the measure, we start from a non-parametric generative model of
the outcome. Depending on the nature of the outcome, some causal measures
disentangle treatment modulations from baseline risk. Therefore, our analysis
outlines an understanding what heterogeneity and homogeneity of treatment
effect mean, not through the lens of the measure, but through the lens of the

different sets of covariates are needed to generalize an effect to a different

accomplished by applying an EM-type algorithm - provides a joint graphon
estimate plus a corresponding prediction of the node positions for each
network. In particular, it entails a generalized network alignment, where
nearby nodes play similar structural roles in their respective domains. Given
that, we construct a chi-squared test on equivalence of network structures.
Simulation studies and real-world examples support the applicability of our
network comparison strategy.

ATLAS$^{3D}$ project, which we re-analysed, and the satellite galaxies of the
Milky Way, we obtained a galaxy sample that covers the stellar mass range
$10^{4}$ to $10^{12} M_{\odot}$. Using this large range we find that the mass -
metallicity relation is not linear. We also find that the [$\alpha$/Fe]-stellar
mass relation of the full sample shows a U-shape, with a minimum in
[$\alpha$/Fe] for masses between $10^{9}-10^{10} M_{\odot}$. The relation
between [$\alpha$/Fe] and stellar mass can be understood in the following way:
When the faintest galaxies enter the cluster environment, a rapid burst of star
formation is induced, after which the gas content is blown away by various
quenching mechanisms. This fast star formation causes high [$\alpha$/Fe]
values, like in the Galactic halo. More massive galaxies will manage to keep
their gas longer and form several bursts of star formation, with lower
[$\alpha$/Fe] as a result. For massive galaxies, stellar populations are
regulated by internal processes, leading to [$\alpha$/Fe] increasing with mass.
We confirm this model by showing that [$\alpha$/Fe] correlates with
clustercentric distance in three nearby clusters, and also in the halo of the
Milky Way.

in the presence of local extrema. Our study is motivated by the fact that most
of the existing source seeking methods follow the gradient direction of the
signal function and thus only lead to local convergence into a neighborhood of
the nearest local extremum. So far, only a few studies present ideas on how to
overcome local extrema in order to reach a global extremum. None of them apply
to second-order (force- and torque-actuated) nonholonomic vehicles. We consider
what is possibly the simplest conceivable algorithm for such vehicles, which
employs a constant torque and a translational/surge force in proportion to an
approximately differentiated measured signal. We show that the algorithm steers
the unicycle through local extrema towards a global extremum. In contrast to
the previous extremum-seeking studies, in our analysis we do not approximate
the gradient of the objective function but of the objective function's local
spatial average. Such a spatially averaged objective function is expected to
have fewer critical points than the original objective function. Under suitable
assumptions on the averaged objective function and on sufficiently strong
translational damping, we show that the control law achieves practical uniform
asymptotic stability and robustness to sufficiently weak measurement noise and
disturbances to the force and torque inputs.

$d(ER)$ of the bisimplicial set $ER$ maps to the simplicial set $DR$ by a
natural projection $d(\pi_R) \colon d(ER) \to DR$.
  We introduce a criterion on relations of categories ensuring that the
projection from the diagonal of the bisimplicial rectangle nerve to the Dowker
nerve is a weak equivalence. Relations satisfying this criterion are called

be recovered to some extent, the GKP code has found recent applications in
theoretical investigations of quantum communication protocols. While previous
studies have primarily focused on GKP qubits, the possible practical benefits
of higher-dimensional GKP qudits are hitherto widely unexplored. In this paper,
we carry out performance analyses for three quantum repeater protocols based on
GKP qudits including concatenations with a multi-qudit quantum polynomial code.
We find that the potential data transmission gains for qudits are often
hampered by their decreased GKP error-correcting capabilities. However, we also
identify parameter regimes in which having access to an increased number of
quantum levels per mode can enhance the theoretically achievable secret-key
rate of the quantum repeater. Some of our protocols share the attractive
feature that local processing and complete error syndrome identification are
realizable without online squeezing. Provided a supply of suitable multi-mode

Love number vanishing with $\text{SL}\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)$ representation

flat and doubly spinning (Myers-Perry) black holes. We consider the scalar
response of Myers-Perry black holes and extract its static scalar Love numbers.
In agreement with the naturalness arguments, these Love numbers are, in
general, non-zero and exhibit logarithmic running unless certain resonant
conditions are met; these conditions include new cases with no previously known
analogs. We show that there exist two near-zone truncations of the equations of
motion that exhibit enhanced $\text{SL}\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)$ Love
symmetries that explain the vanishing of the static scalar Love numbers in the
resonant cases. These Love symmetries can be interpreted as local
$\text{SL}\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)\times\text{SL}\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)$
near-zone symmetries spontaneously broken down to global
$\text{SL}\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)\times U\left(1\right)$ symmetries by the
periodic identification of the azimuthal angles. We also discover an
infinite-dimensional extension of the Love symmetry into
$\text{SL}\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)\ltimes\hat{U}\left(1\right)_{\mathcal{V}}^2$
that contains both Love symmetries as particular subalgebras, along with a
family of $\text{SL}\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)$ subalgebras that reduce to the
exact near-horizon Myers-Perry black hole isometries in the extremal limit.
Finally, we show that the Love symmetries acquire a geometric interpretation as
isometries of subtracted (effective) black hole geometries that preserve the
internal structure of the black hole and interpret these non-extremal
$\text{SL}\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)$ structures as remnants of the enhanced
isometry of the near-horizon extremal geometries.

human-computer interaction (HCI) and a key requirement for the development of
intelligent interactive systems. Interactive behaviour has a sequential
(actions happen one after another) and hierarchical (a sequence of actions
forms an activity driven by interaction goals) structure, which may be similar
to the structure of natural language. Designed based on such a structure,
natural language processing (NLP) methods have achieved groundbreaking success
in various downstream tasks. However, few works linked interactive behaviour
with natural language. In this paper, we explore the similarity between
interactive behaviour and natural language by applying an NLP method, byte pair
encoding (BPE), to encode mouse and keyboard behaviour. We then analyse the
vocabulary, i.e., the set of action sequences, learnt by BPE, as well as use
the vocabulary to encode the input behaviour for interactive task recognition.
An existing dataset collected in constrained lab settings and our novel
out-of-the-lab dataset were used for evaluation. Results show that this natural
language-inspired approach not only learns action sequences that reflect
specific interaction goals, but also achieves higher F1 scores on task
recognition than other methods. Our work reveals the similarity between
interactive behaviour and natural language, and presents the potential of
applying the new pack of methods that leverage insights from NLP to model
interactive behaviour in HCI.

round deterministic distributed algorithm for the maximal independent set

problems are among the most central problems in distributed graph algorithms
and have been studied extensively for the past four decades. This improved
round complexity comes closer to the $\tilde{\Omega}(\log n)$ lower bound of
maximal independent set and maximal matching [Balliu et al. FOCS '19]. The
previous best known deterministic complexity for all of these problems was
$\Theta(\log^3 n)$. Via the shattering technique, the improvement permeates
also to the corresponding randomized complexities, e.g., the new randomized
complexity of $\Delta+1$ vertex coloring is now $\tilde{O}(\log^2\log n)$
rounds.
  Our approach is a novel combination of the previously known two methods for
developing deterministic algorithms for these problems, namely global
derandomization via network decomposition (see e.g., [Rozhon, Ghaffari STOC'20;
Ghaffari, Grunau, Rozhon SODA'21; Ghaffari et al. SODA'23]) and local rounding
of fractional solutions (see e.g., [Fischer DISC'17; Harris FOCS'19; Fischer,
Ghaffari, Kuhn FOCS'17; Ghaffari, Kuhn FOCS'21; Faour et al. SODA'23]). We
consider a relaxation of the classic network decomposition concept, where
instead of requiring the clusters in the same block to be non-adjacent, we
allow each node to have a small number of neighboring clusters. We also show a
deterministic algorithm that computes this relaxed decomposition faster than
standard decompositions. We then use this relaxed decomposition to
significantly improve the integrality of certain fractional solutions, before
handing them to the local rounding procedure that now has to do fewer rounding
steps.

underneath the erupting mini-filament as it quickly ascended, and subsequently,
some dark materials blew out when the erupting mini-filament interacted with
the outer ambient loops, thus forming a blowout jet characterized by a widening
spire. At the same time, multiple small bright blobs of 1-2 Mm appeared at the
interaction region and propagated along the post-eruption loops toward the
footpoints of the erupting fluxes at a speed of ~ 100 km/s. They also caused a
semi-circular brightening structure. Based on these features, we suggest that
the mini-filament eruption first experiences internal and then external
reconnection, the latter of which mainly transfers mass and magnetic flux of
the erupting mini-filament to the ambient corona.

group of UV-dim stars, that, in the ultraviolet Hubble Space Telescope filters,
are located at colors on the red side of the typical ""fan"" shape displayed by
the eMSTO. We model the UV-dim stars by assuming that some of the stars which
would intrinsically be located on the left side of the eMSTO are obscured by a
ring of dust due to grain condensation at the periphery of the excretion disc
expelled when they spin at the high rotation rates typical of stars in the Be
stage. A reasonably low optical depth at 10$\mu$ is necessary to model the
UV-dim group. Introduction of dust in the interpretation of the eMSTO may
require a substantial re-evaluation of previous conclusions concerning the role
of age and/or rotation spreads in the MC clusters: the entire eMSTO can be
populated by dusty stars, and the reddest UV-dim stars simply represents the
tail of the distribution with both maximum obscuration and the dust ring seen
along the line of sight. The model stars having higher rotational projected
velocity ($v \sin$ i) are predicted to be preferentially redder than the
slowly-rotating stars. The mass loss responsible for the dust may also cause
the non-monotonic distribution of stars in the upper main sequence, with two

light on this research field for the first time with essential contributions on

MPEblink that involves 686 untrimmed videos with 8748 eyeblink events is
proposed under multi-person conditions. The samples are captured from
unconstrained films to reveal ""in the wild"" characteristics. Meanwhile, a

simultaneously addresses the sub-tasks of face detection, face tracking, and

(1) eyeblink features can be facilitated via the face's global context (e.g.,
head pose and illumination condition) with joint optimization and interaction,

save time remarkably to meet the real-time running requirement. Experiments on

provide scientists with a controlled and safe environment to perform
experiments. Working on experiments in these isolated containment cells
requires scientists to be physically present. For hot cell work today,
scientists manipulate equipment and radioactive material inside through a
bilateral mechanical control mechanism. Motions produced outside the cell with
the master control levers are mechanically transferred to the internal grippers
inside the shielded containment cell. There is a growing need to have the
capability to conduct experiments within these cells remotely. A simple method
to enable remote manipulations within hot cell and glovebox cells is to mount
two robotic arms inside a box to mimic the motions of human hands. An AR
application was built in this work to allow a user wearing a Microsoft HoloLens
2 headset to teleoperate dual arm manipulators by grasping robotic end-effector
digital replicas in AR from a remote location. In addition to the real-time
replica of the physical robotic arms in AR, the application enables users to
view a live video stream attached to the robotic arms and parse a 3D point
cloud of 3D objects in their remote AR environment for better situational
awareness. This work also provides users with virtual fixture to assist in
manipulation and other teleoperation tasks.

well as synapses and aims for an energy-efficient and fast emulation of
biological neurons. When replicating neuroscientific experiment results, a
major challenge is finding suitable model parameters. This study investigates
the suitability of the sequential neural posterior estimation (SNPE) algorithm
for parameterizing a multi-compartmental neuron model emulated on the BSS-2
analog neuromorphic hardware system. In contrast to other optimization methods
such as genetic algorithms or stochastic searches, the SNPE algorithms belongs
to the class of approximate Bayesian computing (ABC) methods and estimates the
posterior distribution of the model parameters; access to the posterior allows
classifying the confidence in parameter estimations and unveiling correlation
between model parameters. In previous applications, the SNPE algorithm showed a
higher computational efficiency than traditional ABC methods. For our
multi-compartmental model, we show that the approximated posterior is in
agreement with experimental observations and that the identified correlation
between parameters is in agreement with theoretical expectations. Furthermore,
we show that the algorithm can deal with high-dimensional observations and
parameter spaces. These results suggest that the SNPE algorithm is a promising
approach for automating the parameterization of complex models, especially when
dealing with characteristic properties of analog neuromorphic substrates, such
as trial-to-trial variations or limited parameter ranges.

  Information Systems",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recommender systems easily face the issue of user preference shifts. User
representations will become out-of-date and lead to inappropriate
recommendations if user preference has shifted over time. To solve the issue,
existing work focuses on learning robust representations or predicting the
shifting pattern. There lacks a comprehensive view to discover the underlying
reasons for user preference shifts. To understand the preference shift, we
abstract a causal graph to describe the generation procedure of user
interaction sequences. Assuming user preference is stable within a short
period, we abstract the interaction sequence as a set of chronological
environments. From the causal graph, we find that the changes of some
unobserved factors (e.g., becoming pregnant) cause preference shifts between
environments. Besides, the fine-grained user preference over categories
sparsely affects the interactions with different items. Inspired by the causal
graph, our key considerations to handle preference shifts lie in modeling the
interaction generation procedure by: 1) capturing the preference shifts across
environments for accurate preference prediction, and 2) disentangling the
sparse influence from user preference to interactions for accurate effect
estimation of preference. To this end, we propose a Causal Disentangled
Recommendation (CDR) framework, which captures preference shifts via a temporal
variational autoencoder and learns the sparse influence from multiple
environments. Specifically, an encoder is adopted to infer the unobserved
factors from user interactions while a decoder is to model the interaction
generation process. Besides, we introduce two learnable matrices to disentangle
the sparse influence from user preference to interactions. Lastly, we devise a
multi-objective loss to optimize CDR. Extensive experiments on three datasets
show the superiority of CDR.

gas phase chemistry of the interstellar medium. Observations of H3+ are used to
constrain important physical and chemical parameters of interstellar
environments. However, the temperatures inferred from the two lowest rotational
states of H3+ in diffuse lines of sight - typically the only ones observable -
appear consistently lower than the temperatures derived from H2 observations in
the same sightlines. All previous attempts at modelling the temperatures of H3+
in the diffuse interstellar medium failed to reproduce the observational
results. Here we present new studies, comparing an independent master equation
for H3+ level populations to results from the Meudon PDR code for photon
dominated regions. We show that the populations of the lowest rotational states
of H3+ are strongly affected by the formation reaction and that H3+ ions
experience incomplete thermalisation before their destruction by free
electrons. Furthermore, we find that for quantitative analysis more than two
levels of H3+ have to be considered and that it is crucial to include radiative
transitions as well as collisions with H2. Our models of typical diffuse
interstellar sightlines show very good agreement with observational data, and
thus they may finally resolve the perceived temperature difference attributed
to these two fundamental species.

these states are seen to fragment into a collection of nodeless oscillons. The
heavy nodeless oscillon is quite remarkable: despite its energy it is stable

solutions are based on the simple idea of generating one additional virtual

train a network to predict this point correspondence. The second solver uses a
much simpler and more efficient strategy based on the mean points of three
corresponding input points. The new solvers are efficient and easy to implement
since they are based on the existing efficient minimal solvers, i.e., the
well-known 5-point relative pose and the P3P solvers. The solvers achieve
state-of-the-art results on real data. The idea of solving minimal problems
using virtual correspondences is general and can be applied to other problems,
e.g., the 5-point relative pose problem. In this way, minimal problems can be
solved using simpler non-minimal solvers or even using sub-minimal samples
inside RANSAC.
  In addition, we compare different variants of 4p3v solvers with the baseline

different complexities. Linear regression modeling is an important category of
learning algorithms. The practical uncertainty of the target samples affects
the generalization performance of the learned model. Failing to choose a proper
model or hypothesis class can lead to serious issues such as underfitting or
overfitting. These issues have been addressed by alternating cost functions or
by utilizing cross-validation methods. These approaches can introduce new
hyperparameters with their own new challenges and uncertainties or increase the
computational complexity of the learning algorithm. On the other hand, the
theory of probably approximately correct (PAC) aims at defining learnability
based on probabilistic settings. Despite its theoretical value, PAC does not
address practical learning issues on many occasions. This work is inspired by
the foundation of PAC and is motivated by the existing regression learning
issues. The proposed approach, denoted by epsilon-Confidence Approximately
Correct (epsilon CoAC), utilizes Kullback Leibler divergence (relative entropy)
and proposes a new related typical set in the set of hyperparameters to tackle
the learnability issue. Moreover, it enables the learner to compare hypothesis
classes of different complexity orders and choose among them the optimum with
the minimum epsilon in the epsilon CoAC framework. Not only the epsilon CoAC

effective in generating repertoires of diverse and efficient policies by
relying on the definition of a behavior space. A natural goal induced by the
creation of such a repertoire is trying to achieve behaviors on demand, which
can be done by running the corresponding policy from the repertoire. However,
in uncertain environments, two problems arise. First, policies can lack
robustness and repeatability, meaning that multiple episodes under slightly
different conditions often result in very different behaviors. Second, due to
the discrete nature of the repertoire, solutions vary discontinuously. Here we
present a new approach to achieve behavior-conditioned trajectory generation
based on two mechanisms: First, MAP-Elites Low-Spread (ME-LS), which constrains
the selection of solutions to those that are the most consistent in the
behavior space. Second, the Quality-Diversity Transformer (QDT), a
Transformer-based model conditioned on continuous behavior descriptors, which
trains on a dataset generated by policies from a ME-LS repertoire and learns to
autoregressively generate sequences of actions that achieve target behaviors.
Results show that ME-LS produces consistent and robust policies, and that its
combination with the QDT yields a single policy capable of achieving diverse
behaviors on demand with high accuracy.

balance the pruning rate and performance of the network. However, its
population-based nature often suffers from the complex pruning optimization
space and the highly resource-consuming pruning structure verification process,
which limits its application. To this end, this paper proposes an EMO joint
pruning with multiple sub-networks (EMO-PMS) to reduce space complexity and
resource consumption. First, a divide-and-conquer EMO network pruning framework
is proposed, which decomposes the complex EMO pruning task on the whole network
into easier sub-tasks on multiple sub-networks. On the one hand, this
decomposition reduces the pruning optimization space and decreases the
optimization difficulty; on the other hand, the smaller network structure
converges faster, so the computational resource consumption of the proposed
algorithm is lower. Secondly, a sub-network training method based on
cross-network constraints is designed so that the sub-network can process the
features generated by the previous one through feature constraints. This method
allows sub-networks optimized independently to collaborate better and improves
the overall performance of the pruned network. Finally, a multiple sub-networks
joint pruning method based on EMO is proposed. For one thing, it can accurately
measure the feature processing capability of the sub-networks with the
pre-trained feature selector. For another, it can combine multi-objective
pruning results on multiple sub-networks through global performance impairment
ranking to design a joint pruning scheme. The proposed algorithm is validated
on three datasets with different challenging. Compared with fifteen advanced
pruning algorithms, the experiment results exhibit the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

self-gravity must introduce a softening prescription of the gravitational
potential. When the disc is only made of gas the smoothing length is
proportional to the gas scale height. On the other hand when a dust component
is included, the question arises as whether the smoothing length approach can
still be used to quantify not only the dust self-gravity but also its
gravitational interaction with gas.
  We identified grey areas in the standard smoothing length formalism for
computing self-gravity in PPDs uniquely made of gas. We revisit the smoothing
length approach which is then generalised to two phases when the dust component
can be considered as a pressureless fluid.
  Analytical developments are used to approximate the vertically averaged
self-gravity when the smoothing length is not assumed to be constant but rather
a spatial function.
  We obtained an analytical expression for the space varying smoothing length,
which strongly improves the accuracy of the self-gravity computation. For the
first time, this method is generalised to address bi-fluid interactions in a
PPD: two additional smoothing lengths are proposed for featuring an isolated
dusty disc and gas-dust self-gravity interactions. We checked that our method
remains compatible with standard fast Fourier transform algorithms and
evaluated computational costs.
  Our space varying smoothing length permits (i) to solve the contradictions
inherent to a constant smoothing length hypothesis, (ii) to fit accurately the
3D vertically averaged self-gravity and (iii) is applicable to a bi-fluid
description of PPDs with the use of two additional smoothing lengths. Such
results are crucial to enable realistic 2D numerical simulations accounting for
self-gravity and are important to deepen our understanding of planetesimals
formation and type I migration.

have been considerably facilitated. However, the rise of mobile social network
fraud upon those networks, has caused a great deal of distress, in case of
depleting personal and social wealth, then potentially doing significant
economic harm. To detect fraudulent users, call detail record (CDR) data, which
portrays the social behavior of users in mobile networks, has been widely
utilized. But the imbalance problem in the aforementioned data, which could
severely hinder the effectiveness of fraud detectors based on graph neural
networks(GNN), has hardly been addressed in previous work. In this paper, we
are going to present a novel Cost-Sensitive Graph Neural Network (CSGNN) by
creatively combining cost-sensitive learning and graph neural networks. We
conduct extensive experiments on two open-source realworld mobile network fraud
datasets. The results show that CSGNN can effectively solve the graph imbalance
problem and then achieve better detection performance than the state-of-the-art
algorithms. We believe that our research can be applied to solve the graph
imbalance problems in other fields. The CSGNN code and datasets are publicly

conclude that this understanding needs to be based on certain preconditions. In
this article, the robustness of BA scale-free network and WS small-world
network is studied based on the edge-removal attack strategy considering the
edge load and cascading failure. Specific attack methods include: High Load
Edge-removal Attacks (HLEA) and Low Load Edge-removal Attacks (LLEA). The
simulation results show that the importance of edges is closely related to the
load parameter {\delta}. When 0<{\delta}<1, attacking the edge with smaller
degree will cause greater cascading failure. For this condition, the edge with
smaller degree is more important. When {\delta}=1, cascading failure is
basically independent of the edge degree. When {\delta}>1, attacking the edge
with larger degree will cause greater cascading failure. Therefore, the edge
with larger degree is more important for this condition.

rigid object manipulation would struggle in this setting due to the complexity
of physics interaction with deformable objects. At the same time, previous
trajectory optimization approaches with differentiable physics for deformable
manipulation would suffer from local optima caused by the explosion of contact
modes from hand-object interactions. To address these challenges, we propose
DexDeform, a principled framework that abstracts dexterous manipulation skills
from human demonstration and refines the learned skills with differentiable
physics. Concretely, we first collect a small set of human demonstrations using
teleoperation. And we then train a skill model using demonstrations for
planning over action abstractions in imagination. To explore the goal space, we
further apply augmentations to the existing deformable shapes in demonstrations
and use a gradient optimizer to refine the actions planned by the skill model.
Finally, we adopt the refined trajectories as new demonstrations for finetuning
the skill model. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce a
suite of six challenging dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks.
Compared with baselines, DexDeform is able to better explore and generalize
across novel goals unseen in the initial human demonstrations.

applying these models to new datasets, particularly from wearable devices,
raises two questions. First, when annotations on a target dataset are
unavailable, which different data characteristics affect the sleep stage
scoring performance the most and by how much? Second, when annotations are
available, which dataset should be used as the source of transfer learning to
optimize performance? In this paper, we propose a novel method for
computationally quantifying the impact of different data characteristics on the
transferability of deep learning models. Quantification is accomplished by
training and evaluating two models with significant architectural differences,
TinySleepNet and U-Time, under various transfer configurations in which the
source and target datasets have different recording channels, recording
environments, and subject conditions. For the first question, the environment
had the highest impact on sleep stage scoring performance, with performance
degrading by over 14% when sleep annotations were unavailable. For the second
question, the most useful transfer sources for TinySleepNet and the U-Time
models were MASS-SS1 and ISRUC-SG1, containing a high percentage of N1 (the
rarest sleep stage) relative to the others. The frontal and central EEGs were
preferred for TinySleepNet. The proposed approach enables full utilization of
existing sleep datasets for training and planning model transfer to maximize
the sleep stage scoring performance on a target problem when sleep annotations
are limited or unavailable, supporting the realization of remote sleep

  Imperfect Modalities","10 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, journal",,,,"eess.SP cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sleep abnormalities can have severe health consequences. Automated sleep
staging, i.e. labelling the sequence of sleep stages from the patient's
physiological recordings, could simplify the diagnostic process. Previous work
on automated sleep staging has achieved great results, mainly relying on the
EEG signal. However, often multiple sources of information are available beyond
EEG. This can be particularly beneficial when the EEG recordings are noisy or
even missing completely. In this paper, we propose CoRe-Sleep, a Coordinated
Representation multimodal fusion network that is particularly focused on
improving the robustness of signal analysis on imperfect data. We demonstrate
how appropriately handling multimodal information can be the key to achieving
such robustness. CoRe-Sleep tolerates noisy or missing modalities segments,
allowing training on incomplete data. Additionally, it shows state-of-the-art
performance when testing on both multimodal and unimodal data using a single
model on SHHS-1, the largest publicly available study that includes sleep stage
labels. The results indicate that training the model on multimodal data does
positively influence performance when tested on unimodal data. This work aims
at bridging the gap between automated analysis tools and their clinical
utility.

  Asthma Patients during COVID-19 Pandemic","Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing (2022)",,"10.1155/2022/6870358",,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  COVID19 and asthma are respiratory diseases that can be life threatening in
uncontrolled circumstances and require continuous monitoring. A poverty
stricken South Asian country like Bangladesh has been bearing the brunt of the
COVID19 pandemic since its beginning. The majority of the country's population
resides in rural areas, where proper healthcare is difficult to access. This
emphasizes the necessity of telemedicine, implementing the concept of the
Internet of Things (IoT), which is still under development in Bangladesh. This
paper demonstrates how the current challenges in the healthcare system are
resolvable through the design of a remote health and environment monitoring
system, specifically for asthma patients who are at an increased risk of
COVID19. Since on-time treatment is essential, this system will allow doctors
and medical staff to receive patient information in real time and deliver their
services immediately to the patient regardless of their location. The proposed
system consists of various sensors collecting heart rate, body temperature,
ambient temperature, humidity, and air quality data and processing them through
the Arduino Microcontroller. It is integrated with a mobile application. All
this data is sent to the mobile application via a Bluetooth module and updated
every few seconds so that the medical staff can instantly track patients'
conditions and emergencies. The developed prototype is portable and easily
usable by anyone. The system has been applied to five people of different ages
and medical histories over a particular period. Upon analyzing all their data,
it became clear which participants were particularly vulnerable to health
deterioration and needed constant observation. Through this research, awareness
about asthmatic symptoms will improve and help prevent their severity through
effective treatment anytime, anywhere.

effectively achieved using reactive programming, which leverages temporal
abstraction and data caching mechanisms to create dynamic workflows. However,
implementing a temporal cache for large-scale simulations can be challenging.
Implicit neural networks have proven effective in compressing large volume
data. However, their application to distributed data has yet to be fully
explored. In this work, we develop an implicit neural representation for
distributed volume data and incorporate it into the DIVA reactive programming
system. This implementation enables us to build an in situ temporal caching
system with a capacity 100 times larger than previously achieved. We integrate
our implementation into the Ascent infrastructure and evaluate its performance
using real-world simulations.

forces educational institutions worldwide to revisit their exam procedures. In
the pre-GPT era, we successfully applied oral and open-book home exams for two
courses in the third year of our predominantly remote Software Engineering BSc
program. We ask in this paper whether our current open-book exams are still
viable or whether a move back to a legally compliant but less scalable oral
exam is the only workable alternative. We further compare work-effort estimates
between oral and open-book exams and report on differences in throughput and
grade distribution over eight years to better understand the impact of
examination format on the outcome. Examining GPT v4 on the most recent
open-book exams showed that our current Artificial Intelligence and Reactive
Programming exams are not GPT v4 proof. Three potential weaknesses of GPT are
outlined. We also found that grade distributions have largely been unaffected
by the examination format, opening up for a move to oral examinations only if
needed. Throughput was higher for open-book exam course instances (73% vs 64%),
while fail rates were too (12% vs 7%), with teacher workload increasing even
for smaller classes. We also report on our experience regarding effort. Oral
examinations are efficient for smaller groups but come with caveats regarding
intensity and stress.

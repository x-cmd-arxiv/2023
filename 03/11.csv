models' fa\c{c}ades using dense, street-level, terrestrial point clouds seems a
promising strategy. In this paper, we propose a method of combining visibility
analysis and neural networks for enriching 3D models with window and door
features. In the method, occupancy voxels are fused with classified point
clouds, which provides semantics to voxels. Voxels are also used to identify
conflicts between laser observations and 3D models. The semantic voxels and
conflicts are combined in a Bayesian network to classify and delineate
fa\c{c}ade openings, which are reconstructed using a 3D model library.
Unaffected building semantics is preserved while the updated one is added,
thereby upgrading the building model to LoD3. Moreover, Bayesian network
results are back-projected onto point clouds to improve points' classification
accuracy. We tested our method on a municipal CityGML LoD2 repository and the
open point cloud datasets: TUM-MLS-2016 and TUM-FA\c{C}ADE. Validation results
revealed that the method improves the accuracy of point cloud semantic

applied to enhance the accuracy of urban simulations and facilitate the

  (2) Additionally, we show over the field of rationals that bivariate linear
matrix factorization of 4 x 4 matrices is at least as hard as factoring
square-free integers. This indicates that reducing noncommutative polynomial

predict the probability of an outcome, they can recognise when the bookmaker's
odds are in their favour. As sports betting is a multi-billion dollar industry

Many researchers have applied machine learning to the sports outcome prediction
problem, generally using accuracy to evaluate the performance of forecasting

is more important than accuracy. To test this hypothesis, we train models on
NBA data over several seasons and run betting experiments on a single season,
using published odds. Evaluating various betting systems, we show that
optimising the forecasting model for calibration leads to greater returns than
optimising for accuracy, on average (return on investment of $110.42\%$ versus
$2.98\%$) and in the best case ($902.01\%$ versus $222.84\%$). These findings
suggest that for sports betting (or any forecasting problem where decisions are
made based on the predicted probability of each outcome), calibration is a more
important metric than accuracy. Sports bettors who wish to increase profits
should therefore optimise their forecasting model for calibration.

topmost layers. This comprehensive study combines surface methods (nc-AFM, STM,
LEED, and XPS) complemented by structural and chemical analysis of the
near-surface bulk (HRTEM and EELS). The results show that a compact 2D layer
constitutes the topmost surface of ${\alpha}-Fe_{2}O_{3}(0001)$; it is locally
corrugated due to the mismatch with the bulk. Assessing the influence of
naturally-occurring impurities shows that these can force the formation of
surface phases that are not stable on pure samples. Impurities can also cause
the formation of ill-defined inclusions in the subsurface and modify the
oxidation phase diagram of hematite. The results provide a significant step
forward in determining the hematite surface structure that is crucial for
accurately modeling catalytic reactions. Combining surface and cross-sectional
imaging provided the full view that is essential for understanding the
evolution of the near-surface region of oxide surfaces under oxidative
conditions.

approximate solutions for NDPs. Using two NDP variants and an exact solver as
benchmark, we show that our proposed framework can provide solutions within 5%
gap of the global optimum results given less than 1% of the time required for
finding the optimal results. Our framework can be utilized within an expert
system for infrastructure planning to intelligently determine the best
infrastructure management decisions. Given the flexibility of the framework, it
can easily be adapted to many other decision problems that can be modeled as
bi-level problems on graphs. Moreover, we observe many interesting future
directions, thus we propose a brief research agenda for this topic. The key
observation inspiring influential future research was that fitness function
evaluation time using the inferences made by the GNN model for the genetic
algorithm was in the order of milliseconds, which points to an opportunity and
a need for novel heuristics that 1) can cope well with noisy fitness function
values provided by neural networks, and 2) can use the significantly higher
computation time provided to them to explore the search space effectively
(rather than efficiently). This opens a new avenue for a modern class of
metaheuristics that are crafted for use with AI-powered predictors.

monodromic singularities lying on the switching curve can always be split apart

widely used for various robotic perception and control tasks. In this paper, we
present a method for interactive perception using vision-based tactile sensors
for a part mating task, where a robot can use tactile sensors and a feedback
mechanism using a particle filter to incrementally improve its estimate of
objects (pegs and holes) that fit together. To do this, we first train a deep
neural network that makes use of tactile images to predict the probabilistic
correspondence between arbitrarily shaped objects that fit together. The
trained model is used to design a particle filter which is used twofold. First,
given one partial (or non-unique) observation of the hole, it incrementally
improves the estimate of the correct peg by sampling more tactile observations.
Second, it selects the next action for the robot to sample the next touch (and
thus image) which results in maximum uncertainty reduction to minimize the
number of interactions during the perception task. We evaluate our method on
several part-mating tasks with novel objects using a robot equipped with a
vision-based tactile sensor. We also show the efficiency of the proposed action

previous studies producing contrasting results, due at least in part to limited

reconfirmed the ITE, and demonstrated an absence of effect for attributes other

pattern of effects was found for LLM-simulated participants. The second study
concerns a specific mode of influence - populist framing of news to increase
its persuasion and political mobilization. Data from LLM-simulated participants
was collected and compared to previously published data from a 15-country

from the human study were replicated by the simulated study, including effects
that surprised the authors of the human study by contradicting their
theoretical expectations (anti-immigrant framing of news decreases its
persuasion and mobilization); but some significant relationships found in human

observed gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary mergers with highly
asymmetric mass ratios for the first time, including both binary black hole
(BBH) and neutron-star--black hole (NSBH) systems. It appears that NSBHs with
mass ratios $q \simeq 0.2$ are more common than equally asymmetric BBHs, but
the reason for this remains unclear. In this work, we use the binary population
synthesis code COSMIC to investigate the evolutionary pathways leading to the
formation of asymmetric compact binaries and the factors that cause them to
merge. We find that within the context of isolated binary stellar evolution,
most asymmetric binary mergers start off as asymmetric stellar binaries.
Because of the initial asymmetry, these systems tend to first undergo a
dynamically unstable mass transfer phase. However, after the first star
collapses to a compact object, the mass ratio is close to unity and the second
phase of mass transfer is usually stable. According to our simulations, this
stable mass transfer fails to shrink the orbit enough on its own for the system
to merge. Instead, we find that the natal kick received by the second-born
compact object during its stellar collapse plays a key role in determining how
many of these systems can merge. For the most asymmetric systems with mass
ratios $q \leq 0.1$, the merging systems in our models receive an average kick
magnitude of 255 km s$^{-1}$ during the second collapse, while the average kick
for non-merging systems is 59 km s$^{-1}$. Because lower mass compact objects,
like NSs, are expected to receive larger natal kicks than higher mass BHs, this
may explain why asymmetric NSBH systems merge more frequently than asymmetric
BBH systems.

radial velocity semi-amplitudes, ranging from $\sim$ (50-130) km s$^{-1}$. We

strategies for learning with limited labeled data, and abundant unlabeled data
has led to the widespread use of these models. They are usually pretrained,
finetuned, and evaluated on the same data distribution, i.e., within an
in-distribution setting. However, they tend to perform poorly in
out-of-distribution evaluation scenarios, a challenge that Unsupervised Domain
Generalization (UDG) seeks to address.
  This paper introduces a novel method to standardize the styles of images in a
batch. Batch styles standardization, relying on Fourier-based augmentations,
promotes domain invariance in SSL by preventing spurious correlations from
leaking into the features. The combination of batch styles standardization with
the well-known contrastive-based method SimCLR leads to a novel UDG method
named CLaSSy ($\textbf{C}$ontrastive $\textbf{L}$e$\textbf{a}$rning with
$\textbf{S}$tandardized $\textbf{S}$t$\textbf{y}$les). CLaSSy offers serious
advantages over prior methods, as it does not rely on domain labels and is
scalable to handle a large number of domains. Experimental results on various
UDG datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CLaSSy compared to
existing UDG methods. Finally, the versatility of the proposed batch styles
standardization is demonstrated by extending respectively the contrastive-based
and non-contrastive-based SSL methods, SWaV and MSN, while considering
different backbone architectures (convolutional-based, transformers-based).

recommendation systems in industrial applications, wherein an effective and
practical approach is to carry out multi-scenario transfer learning on the
basis of the Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) architecture. However, the MoE-based
method, which aims to project all information in the same feature space, cannot
effectively deal with the complex relationships inherent among various
scenarios and tasks, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. To tackle the
problem, we propose a Hierarchical information extraction Network (HiNet) for
multi-scenario and multi-task recommendation, which achieves hierarchical
extraction based on coarse-to-fine knowledge transfer scheme. The multiple
extraction layers of the hierarchical network enable the model to enhance the
capability of transferring valuable information across scenarios while
preserving specific features of scenarios and tasks. Furthermore, a novel
scenario-aware attentive network module is proposed to model correlations
between scenarios explicitly. Comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world
industrial datasets from Meituan Meishi platform demonstrate that HiNet
achieves a new state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms
existing solutions. HiNet is currently fully deployed in two scenarios and has
achieved 2.87% and 1.75% order quantity gain respectively.

is warranted as intercurrent events, such as - due to patients who switch
treatment after disease progression, are often extreme. Statistical analyses
may then easily lure one into making large implicit extrapolations, which often
go unnoticed. We will illustrate this problem of implicit extrapolations using
a real oncology case study, with a right-censored time-to-event endpoint, in
which patients can cross over from the control to the experimental treatment
after disease progression, for ethical reasons. We resolve this by developing
an estimator for the survival risk ratio contrasting the survival probabilities
at each time t if all patients would take experimental treatment with the
survival probabilities at those times t if all patients would take control
treatment up to time t, using randomization as an instrumental variable to
avoid reliance on no unmeasured confounders assumptions. This doubly robust

survival times. Insight into the rationale behind the estimator is provided and
the approach is demonstrated by re-analyzing the oncology trial.

research on this topic, the first result breaking the $O(\sqrt{n})$ barrier on

by Forster, Goranci and Henzinger [SODA'21] who achieved $m^{1/\rho+o(1)}$
amortized update time with a $O(\log n)^{3\rho-2}$ factor in the approximation
ratio, for any parameter $\rho \geq 1$.
  In this paper, we give the first constant-stretch fully dynamic distance
oracle with a small polynomial update and query time. Prior work required
either at least a poly-logarithmic approximation or much larger update time.
Our result gives a more fine-grained trade-off between stretch and update time,
for instance we can achieve constant stretch of $O(\frac{1}{\rho^2})^{4/\rho}$
in amortized update time $\tilde{O}(n^{\rho})$, and query time
$\tilde{O}(n^{\rho/8})$ for a constant parameter $\rho <1$. Our algorithm is
randomized and assumes an oblivious adversary.

reduction from decremental approximate hub-labeling schemes to fully dynamic
distance oracles, which may be of independent interest. We then apply this

(e.g., n = 11), inspiring an extension of the KAI (Kolmogorov-Avrami-Ishibashi)

control. However, with the developments of sensing and computing techniques,
reinforcement learning (RL) is getting increasing attention recently. With each

model-based and learning-based control approaches, respectively. Although
researchers have applied certain forms of MPC and RL to control the greenhouse
climate, very few effort has been allocated to analyze connections,
differences, pros and cons between MPC and RL either from a mathematical or

systems rely on the use of mathematical models that should be validated, or at
best, not invalidated. Model validation usually involves the comparison of
experimental data (outputs from the system of interest) and model predictions,
both obtained at a specific validation scenario. The design of this validation
experiment should be directly relevant to the objective of the model, that of
predicting a quantity of interest at a prediction scenario. In this paper, we
address two specific issues arising when designing validation experiments. The
first issue consists in determining an appropriate validation scenario in cases
where the prediction scenario cannot be carried out in a controlled
environment. The second issue concerns the selection of observations when the
quantity of interest cannot be readily observed. The proposed methodology
involves the computation of influence matrices that characterize the response
surface of given model functionals. Minimization of the distance between
influence matrices allow one for selecting a validation experiment most
representative of the prediction scenario. We illustrate our approach on two
numerical examples. The first example considers the validation of a simple
model based on an ordinary differential equation governing an object in free
fall to put in evidence the importance of the choice of the validation
experiment. The second numerical experiment focuses on the transport of a
pollutant and demonstrates the impact that the choice of the quantity of
interest has on the validation experiment to be performed.

general relativity can explain flat and rising rotation curves, such as those
observed in galaxies, without the need for dark matter. If one models a galaxy
as an axisymmetric, stationary, rotating, non-relativistic and pressureless
'dust' of stars in the gravitoelectromagnetic (GEM) formalism, we show that GEM
effects on the circular velocity $v$ of a star are $O(10^{-6})$ smaller than
the standard Newtonian (gravitoelectric) effects. Moreover, we find that
gravitomagnetic effects are $O(10^{-6})$ too small to provide the vertical
support necessary to maintain the dynamical equilibrium assumed. These issues
are obscured if one constructs a single equation for $v$, as considered
previously. We nevertheless solve this equation for a galaxy having a
Miyamoto--Nagai density profile. We show that for the values of the mass, $M$,
and semi-major and semi-minor axes, $a$ and $b$, typical for a dwarf galaxy,
the rotation curve depends only very weakly on $M$. Moreover, for aspect ratios
$a/b > 2$, the rotation curves are concave over their entire range, which does
not match observations in any galaxy. Most importantly, we show that for the
poloidal gravitomagnetic flux $\psi$ to provide the necessary vertical support,
it must become singular at the origin. This originates from the unwitting, but
forbidden, inclusion of free-space solutions of the Poisson-like equation that
determines $\psi$, hence ruling out the methodology as a means of explaining
flat galaxy rotation curves. We further show that recent deliberate attempts to
leverage such free-space solutions against the rotation curve problem yield no
deterministic modification outside the thin disk approximation, and that, in
any case, the homogeneous contributions to $\psi$ are ruled out by the boundary
value problem posed by any physical axisymmetric galaxy.

Investigating such complex regions presents several issues, including the
variation of seismic velocity due to the diversity of geological units and the
cumulative damage caused by earthquakes. Conventional migration techniques are
in general strongly sensitive to the available velocity model. Here we apply a
passive matrix imaging approach which is robust to the mismatch between this
model and the real seismic velocity distribution. This method relies on the
cross-correlation of ambient noise recorded by a geophone array. The resulting
set of impulse responses form a reflection matrix that contains all the
information about the subsoil. In particular, the reflected body waves can be
leveraged to: (i) determine the transmission matrix between the Earth's surface

underground reflectivity with a transverse resolution only limited by

negative mining strategies have been shown to help models learn more subtle

the implementation of the mining strategy disrupts the difficulty distribution
of samples in the real dataset, which may cause the model to over-fit these
difficult samples. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate how to trade off
the difficulty of the mined samples in order to obtain and exploit high-quality
negative samples, and try to solve the problem in terms of both the loss
function and the training strategy. The proposed balance loss provides an
effective discriminant for the quality of negative samples by combining a
self-supervised approach to the loss function, and uses a dynamic gradient
modulation strategy to achieve finer gradient adjustment for samples of
different difficulties. The proposed annealing training strategy then
constrains the difficulty of the samples drawn from negative sample mining to
provide data sources with different difficulty distributions for the loss
function, and uses samples of decreasing difficulty to train the model.

$\approx\, 12\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and approximately half of the envelope
simulated. From this simulation, we extract light curves from several
directions, average them over each hemisphere, and process them as if they were
real photometric observations. We show how core convection excites waves with a
similar frequency as the convective time scale in addition to significant power
across a forest of low and high angular degree $l$ modes. We find that the
coherence of these modes is relatively low as a result of their stochastic
excitation by core convection, with lifetimes on the order of 10s of days.
Thanks to the still significant power at higher $l$ and this relatively low

that still contains measurable power up to the Brunt--V\""ais\""al\""a frequency.
These power spectra extracted from the stable envelope are qualitatively
similar to observations, with same order of magnitude yet lower characteristic

controllers which usually provide better robustness to modeling uncertainties
than open-loop controllers. However, state estimation of soft robots is very
challenging because soft robots have infinite degrees of freedom theoretically
while existing sensors only provide a limited number of measurements. In this
paper, we design an observer for soft robots based on the well-known Cosserat
rod theory which models soft robots by nonlinear partial differential equations
(PDEs). The observer is able to estimate all the
continuous/infinite-dimensional robot states (poses, strains, and velocities)
by only sensing the tip velocity of the robot (and hence it is called a
``boundary'' observer). More importantly, the estimation error dynamics is
formally proven to be locally input-to-state stable. The key idea is to inject
sequential tip velocity measurements into the observer in a way that dissipates
the energy of the estimation errors through the boundary. Furthermore, this
boundary observer can be implemented by simply changing a boundary condition in
any numerical solvers of Cosserat rod models. Extensive numerical studies are
included and suggest that the domain of attraction is large and the observer is
robust to uncertainties of tip velocity measurements and model parameters.

j* in a sample of 32 early type galaxies (ETGs) from the ePN.S survey, using
full 2D kinematic information out to a mean 6Re. We present lambda and j*
profiles. We derive the distribution of these galaxies on the total j*-M* plane
and determine the ratio between the stellar j* and the specific angular
momentum of the host dark matter halo. The radially extended, 2D kinematic data
show that the stellar halos of ETGs do not contain large stellar mass fractions
of high j*. The j*-profiles of fast-rotator ETGs are largely converged within
the range of the data. For slow rotators, j* is still rising and is estimated
to increase beyond 6Re by up to 40%. More than 60% of their halo angular
momentum is in misaligned rotation. We find that the ePN.S ETG sample displays
the well-known correlation between j*, M*, and morphology: elliptical galaxies
have systematically lower j* than similar mass S0 galaxies. However, fast and
slow rotators lie on the same relation within errors with the slow rotators
falling at the high M* end. A power-law fit to the j*-M* relation gives a slope
of 0.55+-0.17 for the S0s and 0.76+-0.23 for the ellipticals, with
normalisation about 4 and 9 times lower than spirals, respectively. The
estimated retained fraction of angular momentum at 10^10-10^10.5 Msun is 25%
for S0s and >10% for ellipticals, and decreases by 1.5 orders of magnitude at
M*~10^12 Msun. Our results show that ETGs have substantially lower j* than
spiral galaxies with similar M*. Their j* must be lost during their evolution,
and/or retained in the hot gas component and the satellite galaxies that have
not yet merged with the central galaxy. [abridged]

accurately modeling subsurface light transport for translucent objects can be
highly complex and even intractable for neural methods, OSFs learn to
approximate the radiance transfer from a distant light to an outgoing direction
at any spatial location. This approximation avoids explicitly modeling complex

heterogeneous cloud coverage of brown dwarf atmospheres. Cloud-free atmospheric
models also predict that their flux should not be polarized, as polarization is
produced by the light-scattering of particles in the inhomogeneous cloud layers
of brown dwarf atmospheres. To shed light on this dichotomy, we monitored the
linear polarization and photometric variability of the most variable brown
dwarf, 2MASS J21392676+0220226. We used FORS2 at the UT1 telescope to monitor
the object in the z-band for six hours, split on two consecutive nights,
covering one-third of its rotation period. We obtained the Stokes parameters,
and we derived its time-resolved linear polarization, for which we did not find
significant linear polarization (P = 0.14+\-0.07 %). We modeled the linear
polarimetric signal expected assuming a map with one or two spot-like features
and two bands using a polarization-enabled radiative-transfer code. We obtained
values compatible with the time-resolved polarimetry obtained for 2MASS
J21392676+0220226. The lack of significant polarization might be due to
photometric variability produced mostly by banded structures or small-scale
vortices, which cancel out the polarimetric signal from different regions of
the dwarf's disk. Alternatively, the lack of clouds in 2MASS J21392676+0220226
would also explain the lack of polarization. Further linear polarimetric
monitoring of 2MASS J21392676+0220226, during at least one full rotational

criticality of a more exotic kind. The ordered phase breaks SO(3)
spontaneously, but the SO(3)-N\'eel order parameter vanishes. The fermionic
bilinear order parameter is instead a biadjoint with respect to SO(3); unlike
its N\'eel cousin, it constitutes a Mott insulator. Furthermore, I show that
the N\'eel and biadjoint order parameters can be combined to transform as an
adjoint under SU(3) symmetry; the symmetry is emergent at the critical point
separating the symmetric semimetal and the biadjoint insulator, but only if the
flavor number is small enough, suggesting order-parameter fluctuations and the
interplay between different channels play a crucial role in stabilizing the
enlarged symmetry. In candidate SO(3) spin-orbital liqiuds, thermodynamic

is the economic trade-off between two concomitant processes: power production
(the primary driver of short-term revenues), and asset degradation (the main
determinant of long-term expenses). Traditionally, approaches to optimize
production and maintenance in wind farms have been conducted in isolation. In
this paper, we conjecture that a joint optimization of those two processes,
achieved by rigorously modeling their short- and long-term dependencies, can
unlock significant economic benefits for wind farm operators. In specific, we
propose a decision-theoretic framework, rooted in stochastic optimization,
which seeks a sensible balance of how wind loads are leveraged to harness
short-term electricity generation revenues, versus alleviated to hedge against
longer-term maintenance expenses. Extensive numerical experiments using
real-world data confirm the superior performance of our approach, in terms of
several operational performance metrics, relative to methods that tackle the

based on the kinematics of the MW satellites, we discovered an unexpected
behaviour of the dipole term of the radial velocity distribution as a function
of the galactocentric distance. The nearby satellites (<100 kpc) have a bulk
motion with an amplitude of 140-230 km/s while the more distant ones show an
isotropic distribution of the radial velocities. Such strong solar apex
variations can not be explained by the net rotation of the satellites, as it
would require an enormously high rotation rate (~970 km/s). If we exclude the
LMC and its most closely related members from our sample, this does not
suppress the bulk motion of the nearby satellites strongly enough.
Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that the observed peculiar kinematics of the
MW satellites can be explained by a perturbation caused by the first infall of
the LMC. First, we `undone' the effect of the perturbation by integrating the
orbits of the MW satellites backwards (forwards) with (without) massive LMC. It
appears that the present-day peculiar enhancement of the solar apex in the
inner halo is diminished the most in the case of 2x10^{11} Msun LMC. Next, in
self-consistent high-resolution N-body simulations of the MW-LMC interaction,
we found that the solar apex shows the observed behaviour only for the halo
particles with substantial angular momentum, comparable to that of the MW
satellites.

and comprehensive monthly longitudinal survey over nearly three years to
identify new trends in work location choice, mode choice and departure time of
remote workers. The travel behavior of remote workers is found to be highly
associated with employer characteristics, task characteristics, employer remote
work policies, coordination between colleagues and attitudes towards remote
work. Approximately one third of all remote work hours are shown to take place
outside of the home, accounting for over one third of all commuting trips.
These commutes to ""third places"" are shorter, less likely to occur during peak
periods, and more likely to use sustainable travel modes than commutes to an
employer's primary workplace. Hybrid work arrangements are also associated with
a greater number of non-work trips than fully remote and fully in-person
arrangements. Implications of this research for policy makers, shared mobility
provides and land use planning are discussed.

  Aims: the objective of this study is to benefit from the Gaia DR3's reliable
measurements of parallax and proper motion to reveal the binary, ternary, and
quadruple CSs of planetary nebulae.
  Methods: in our search for the binary and multiple CSs in the Gaia archive,
we adopted the criteria provided in the literature to ensure that the CS and
its partner(s) have comparable parallaxes and proper motions.
  Results: we have detected a total of 45 binary and multiple stellar systems
coupled with the CSs of PNe. Based on the standard error of the parallax, this
sample was divided into four categories: highest probable, probable, possible,
and uncertain systems, which comprise 18, 8, 10, and 9 objects, respectively.
Except for A35, NGC246 and IC 3568, the radial velocities of the CSs companions
are unknown for our PNe sample. The radial velocity measurements of these three
companion stars are comparable to their linked CSs. The results show the
detection of a highly probable quadruple system, and a probable quadruple

highly probable (Fr 2-42), one probable (M 1-58) and two possible (IC 2553 and

components of eight wide and very wide binary systems are actually close binary
systems. Moreover, the masses of the components of nine PN binary and multiple

solving Stackelberg games often require knowledge of the follower's cost

circumvent this difficulty, we develop an algorithm that does not require
knowledge of the follower's cost function or an exact best response, making it
more applicable to real-world scenarios. Specifically, our algorithm only
requires the follower to provide an approximately optimal action in response to
the leader's action. The inexact best response is used in computing an
approximate gradient of the leader's objective function, with which
zeroth-order bilevel optimization can be applied to obtain an optimal action
for the leader. Our algorithm is proved to converge at a linear rate to a
neighborhood of the optimal point when the leader's cost function under the
follower's best response is strongly convex and smooth.

applied to the case of a Gaussian beam with p and circularly polarized light
incident on a symmetric structure containing two polar dielectric layers

perturb the graph structure. While existing attack methods have shown promising
attack performance, we would like to design an attack framework to further

leverage its properties to better attack GNNs. Specifically, we first derive

based on randomized smoothing, respectively. A larger certified perturbation
size of a node indicates this node is theoretically more robust to graph
perturbations. Such a property motivates us to focus more on nodes with smaller
certified perturbation sizes, as they are easier to be attacked after graph

MBE-grown MnBi2Te4 thin films with electron doping. In particular, we show that
the non-zero hysteresis loops in the anomalous Hall and magnetic circular
dichroism measurements for even-SLs MnBi2Te4 films are originated from two
different anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) states with opposite magnetoelectric
coefficients that give rise to different energies of zeroth Landau levels of
the surface states in this model. The complex form of the anomalous Hall
hysteresis loop in even-SLs MnBi2Te4 films can be understood from two magnetic
transitions, a transition from one AFM state to the other AFM state followed by
a second transition to the ferromagnetic state. Our model also provides a
microscopic understanding of the electrical switching between two AFM states
via the axion electrodynamics in even-SL MnBi2Te4 films. We further study
orbital magnetization and magnetoelectric coefficient in MnBi2Te4 films, and
find an even-odd oscillation behavior of the magnetoelectric coefficient.

metrics or human rating scores. However, these evaluation methods are general
image quality measurement, and do not account for the nature of the
super-resolution problem. In this work, we analyze the evaluation problem based
on the one-to-many mapping nature of super-resolution, and propose a novel
distribution-based metric for super-resolution. Starting from the distribution
distance, we derive the proposed metric to make it accessible and easy to
compute. Through a human subject study on super-resolution, we show that the
proposed metric is highly correlated with the human perceptual quality, and
better than most existing metrics. Moreover, the proposed metric has a higher
correlation with the fidelity measure compared to the perception-based metrics.
To understand the properties of the proposed metric, we conduct extensive
evaluation in terms of its design choices, and show that the metric is robust
to its design choices. Finally, we show that the metric can be used to train
super-resolution networks for better perceptual quality.

permutations of their inputs form core building blocks of modern deep learning
architectures. Examples include the layers of DeepSets, as well as linear
layers occurring in attention blocks of transformers and some graph neural
networks. The space of permutation equivariant linear layers can be identified
as the invariant subspace of a certain symmetric group representation, and
recent work parameterized this space by exhibiting a basis whose vectors are
sums over orbits of standard basis elements with respect to the symmetric group
action. A parameterization opens up the possibility of learning the weights of
permutation equivariant linear layers via gradient descent. The space of
permutation equivariant linear layers is a generalization of the partition
algebra, an object first discovered in statistical physics with deep
connections to the representation theory of the symmetric group, and the basis
described above generalizes the so-called orbit basis of the partition algebra.
We exhibit an alternative basis, generalizing the diagram basis of the
partition algebra, with computational benefits stemming from the fact that the
tensors making up the basis are low rank in the sense that they naturally
factorize into Kronecker products. Just as multiplication by a rank one matrix
is far less expensive than multiplication by an arbitrary matrix,
multiplication with these low rank tensors is far less expensive than
multiplication with elements of the orbit basis. Finally, we describe an
algorithm implementing multiplication with these basis elements.

work models (combinations of co-located and remote work) as software
professionals' demanded more flexibility and improved work-life balance.
However, hybrid work models reduce the spontaneous, informal face-to-face
interactions that promote group maturation, cohesion, and resilience. Little is
known about how software companies can successfully transition to a hybrid
workforce or the factors that influence the resilience of hybrid software
development teams. Goal. The purpose of this study is to explore the
relationship between hybrid work and team resilience in the context of software
development. Method. Constructivist Grounded Theory was used, based on
interviews of 26 software professionals. This sample included professionals of
different genders, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and levels of experience.
Interviewees came from eight different companies, 22 different projects, and
four different countries. Consistent with grounded theory methodology, data
collection, and analysis were conducted iteratively, in waves, using
theoretical sampling, constant comparison, and initial, focused, and
theoretical coding. Results. Software Team Resilience is the ability of a group
of software professionals to continue working together effectively under
adverse conditions. Resilience depends on the group's maturity. The
configuration of a hybrid team (who works where and when) can promote or hinder
group maturity depending on the level of intra-group interaction it supports.
Conclusion. This paper presents the first study on the resilience of hybrid
software teams. Software teams need resilience to maintain their performance in
the face of disruptions and crises. Software professionals strongly value
hybrid work; therefore, team resilience is a key factor to be considered in the
software industry.

mechanical response of the vertex model (VM) of biological tissue under
compression and dilation. The VM is known to exhibit a transition between rigid
and fluid-like, or floppy, states driven by geometric incompatibility. Target
perimeter and area set a target shape which may not be geometrically
achievable, thereby engendering frustration. Previously, an asymmetry in the
linear elastic response was identified at the rigidity transition between
compression and dilation. Here we show and characterize how the asymmetry
extends away from the transition point for finite strains. Under finite
compression, an initially solid VM can totally relax perimeter tension, and
thereby have reduced bulk and shear modulus. Conversely, an initially floppy VM
under dilation can rigidify and have a higher bulk and shear modulus. These
observations imply that re-scaling of cell area shifts the transition between
rigid and floppy states. Based on this insight, we calculate the re-scaling of
cell area engendered by intrinsic curvature and write a prediction for the
rigidity transition in the presence of curvature. The shift of the rigidity
transition in the presence of curvature for the VM provides a new metric for
predicting tissue rigidity from image data for curved tissues in a manner
analogous to the flat case.

mesh as an explicit density volume. As a result, color values are non-zero only
in the proximity of the FLAME mesh. This FLAME backbone is then integrated into

the biggest challenges is searching for required objects in housing
environments. Previous object-goal navigation requires the robot to search for
a target object category in an unexplored environment, which may not be
suitable for home-assistant robots that typically have some level of semantic
knowledge of the environment, such as the location of static furniture. In our
approach, we leverage this knowledge and the fact that a target object may be
located close to its related objects for efficient navigation. To achieve this,
we train a graph neural network using the Visual Genome dataset to learn the
object co-occurrence relationships and formulate the searching process as
iteratively predicting the possible areas where the target object may be
located. This approach is entirely zero-shot, meaning it doesn't require new
accurate object correlation in the test environment. We empirically show that
our method outperforms prior correlational object search algorithms. As our
ultimate goal is to build fully autonomous assistant robots for everyday use,
we further integrate the task planner for parsing natural language and
generating task-completing plans with object navigation to execute human
instructions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline in both
the AI2-THOR simulator and a Stretch robot in a real-world environment.

the spectral algorithm achieves the minimax optimal error bound (modulo a log

identifying the best $K$ items from approval/disapproval response data),

requirements for low bidirectional communication overhead between the server

accuracy, under the FL assumption that the server does not have access to raw
data to fine-tune the pruned models. We propose Complement Sparsification (CS),
a pruning mechanism that satisfies all these requirements through a
complementary and collaborative pruning done at the server and the clients. At
each round, CS creates a global sparse model that contains the weights that
capture the general data distribution of all clients, while the clients create
local sparse models with the weights pruned from the global model to capture
the local trends. For improved model performance, these two types of
complementary sparse models are aggregated into a dense model in each round,
which is subsequently pruned in an iterative process. CS requires little
computation overhead on the top of vanilla FL for both the server and the
clients. We demonstrate that CS is an approximation of vanilla FL and, thus,
its models perform well. We evaluate CS experimentally with two popular FL
benchmark datasets. CS achieves substantial reduction in bidirectional

We propose two novel zone-based federated training algorithms to optimize zone

Diffusion (ZGD). ZMS optimizes zone models by adapting the zone geographical
partitions through merging of neighboring zones or splitting of large zones

a zone model by incorporating the gradients derived from neighboring zones'
data. ZGD uses a self-attention mechanism to dynamically control the impact of
one zone on its neighbors. Extensive analysis and experimental results

  Field And Emergence Of The Kolmogorov 4/5 And 2/3-Scaling Laws Of Turbulence",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn math-ph math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The 4/5 and 2/3 laws of turbulence can emerge from a theory of 'engineered'
random vector fields $\mathcal{X}_{i}(x,t)
=X_{i}(x,t)+\tfrac{\theta}{\sqrt{d(d+2)}} X_{i}(x,t)\psi(x)$ existing within
$\mathbf{D}\subset\mathbf{R}^{d}$. Here, $X_{i}(x,t)$ is a smooth deterministic
vector field obeying a nonlinear PDE for all
$(x,t)\in\mathbf{D}\times\mathbf{R}^{+}$, and $\theta$ is a small parameter.
The field $\psi(x)$ is a regulated and differentiable Gaussian random field
with expectation $\mathbb{E}[\psi(x)]=0$, but having an antisymmetric
covariance kernel
$\mathscr{K}(x,y)=\mathbb{E}[\psi(x)\psi(y)]=f(x,y)K(\|x-y\|;\lambda)$ with
$f(x,y)=-f(y,x)=1,f(x,x)=f(y,y)=0$ and with $K(\|x-y\|;\lambda)$ a standard
stationary symmetric kernel. For $0\le\ell\le \lambda<L$ with
$X_{i}(x,t)=X_{i}=(0,0,X)$ and $\theta=1$ then for $d=3$, the third-order
structure function is \begin{align}
S_{3}[\ell]=\mathbb{E}\left[|\mathcal{X}_{i}(x+\ell,t)-\mathcal{X}(x,t)|^{3}\right]=-\frac{4}{5}\|X_{i}\|^{3}=-\frac{4}{5}X^{3}\nonumber
\end{align} and $S_{2}[\ell]=CX^{2}$. The classical 4/5 and 2/3-scaling laws
then emerge if one identifies the random field $\mathcal{X}_{i}(x,t)$ with a
turbulent fluid flow $\mathcal{U}_{i}(x,t)$ or velocity, with mean flow
$\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{U}_{i}(x,t)]=U_{i}(x,t)=U_{i}$ being a trivial solution of
Burger's equation. Assuming constant dissipation rate $\epsilon$, small
constant viscosity $\nu$, corresponding to high Reynolds number, and the
standard energy balance law, then for a range $\eta\le\ell\ll \lambda<L$
\begin{align}
S_{3}[\ell]=\mathbb{E}\left[|\mathcal{U}_{i}(x+\ell,t)-\mathcal{U}(x,t)|^{3}\right]=-\frac{4}{5}\epsilon\ell\nonumber
\end{align} where $\eta=(\nu^{3/4}\epsilon)^{-1/4}$. For the second-order
structure function, the 2/3-law emerges as
$S_{2}[\ell]=C\epsilon^{2/3}\ell^{2/3}$.

minor mergers. Here, we apply this technique to 1.3 million galaxies from the
SDSS DR16 photometric catalog and present the probability that each galaxy is a
major or minor merger, splitting the classifications by merger stages (early,
late, post-coalescence). We present publicly-available imaging predictor values
and all of the above classifications for one of the largest-yet samples of
galaxies. We measure the major and minor merger fraction ($f_{\mathrm{merg}}$)
and build a mass-complete sample of galaxies, which we bin as a function of
stellar mass and redshift. For the major mergers, we find a positive slope of
$f_{\mathrm{merg}}$ with stellar mass and negative slope of $f_{\mathrm{merg}}$
with redshift between stellar masses of $10.5 < M_* (log\ M_{\odot}) < 11.6$
and redshifts of $0.03 < z < 0.19$. We are able to reproduce an artificial
positive slope of the major merger fraction with redshift when we do not bin
for mass or craft a complete sample, demonstrating the importance of mass
completeness and mass binning. We determine that the positive trend of the
major merger fraction with stellar mass is consistent with a hierarchical
assembly scenario. The negative trend with redshift requires that an additional
assembly mechanism, such as baryonic feedback, dominates in the local Universe.

representation for several systems in biology, ecology, and micro-fluidics.In
this paper, we analyze the motion of a spheroid in a pressure driven flow of a
shear thinning fluid.The shear thinning rheology is characterized by the
Carreau model.We use a combination of perturbative techniques and the
reciprocal theorem to delineate the kinematics of prolate and oblate
spheroids.There are two perturbative strategies adopted, one near the zero
shear Newtonian plateau and the other near the infinite shear Newtonian
plateau.In both limits, we find that a reduction in effective viscosity
decreases the spheroid's rotational time period in pressure driven flows.The
extent to which shear thinning alters the kinematics is a function of the
particle shape.For a prolate particle, the effect of shear thinning is most
prominent when the spheroid projector is aligned in the direction of the
velocity gradient, while for an oblate particle the effect is most prominent
when the projector is aligned along the flow direction.Lastly, we compare the
tumbling behavior of spheroids in pressure driven flow to those in simple shear
flow.While the time period decreases monotonically with Carreau number for
pressure driven flows, the trend is non monotonic for shear flows where time
period first increases at low Carreau number and then decreases at high Carreau
numbers.Shear thinning does not resolve the degeneracy of Jefferey's orbits.

higher than nighttime noise levels. When using only noise features or a
combination of noise and light features 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNN)
achieved the strongest performance: AUC=0.77, 0.74; Sensitivity=0.60, 0.56;

reduce the human effort in evaluating outlier detection results and effectively
turn the outliers into actionable insights, the users often expect a system to
automatically produce interpretable summarizations of subgroups of outlier
detection results. Unfortunately, to date no such systems exist. To fill this
gap, we propose STAIR which learns a compact set of human understandable rules
to summarize and explain the anomaly detection results. Rather than use the
classical decision tree algorithms to produce these rules, STAIR proposes a new
optimization objective to produce a small number of rules with least
complexity, hence strong interpretability, to accurately summarize the
detection results. The learning algorithm of STAIR produces a rule set by
iteratively splitting the large rules and is optimal in maximizing this
objective in each iteration. Moreover, to effectively handle high dimensional,
highly complex data sets which are hard to summarize with simple rules, we
propose a localized STAIR approach, called L-STAIR. Taking data locality into
consideration, it simultaneously partitions data and learns a set of localized
rules for each partition. Our experimental study on many outlier benchmark
datasets shows that STAIR significantly reduces the complexity of the rules
required to summarize the outlier detection results, thus more amenable for
humans to understand and evaluate, compared to the decision tree methods.

importance in critical decision-making systems, notably in the medical domain.
While recent literature on calibrating deep segmentation networks has led to
significant progress, their uncertainty is usually modeled by leveraging the
information of individual pixels, which disregards the local structure of the
object of interest. In particular, only the recent Spatially Varying Label
Smoothing (SVLS) approach addresses this issue by softening the pixel label
assignments with a discrete spatial Gaussian kernel. In this work, we first
present a constrained optimization perspective of SVLS and demonstrate that it
enforces an implicit constraint on soft class proportions of surrounding
pixels. Furthermore, our analysis shows that SVLS lacks a mechanism to balance
the contribution of the constraint with the primary objective, potentially
hindering the optimization process. Based on these observations, we propose a
principled and simple solution based on equality constraints on the logit
values, which enables to control explicitly both the enforced constraint and
the weight of the penalty, offering more flexibility. Comprehensive experiments
on a variety of well-known segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed approach.

the predictions of these theories for static neutron stars, mainly focusing on
the mass and radii of neutron stars. We aim to demonstrate that although the
models have different inflationary phenomenology, the neutron star
phenomenology predictions of the two models are quite similar. We solve
numerically the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations in the Einstein frame
using a powerful double shooting numerical technique, and after deriving the
mass-radius graphs for three types of polytropic equations of state, we derive
the Jordan frame mass and radii. With regard the equations of state we use
polytropic equation of state with the small density part being either the WFF1,
the APR or the intermediate stiffness equation of state SLy. The results of our
models will be confronted with quite stringent recently developed constraints
on the radius of neutron stars with specific mass. As we show, the only
equation of state which provides results compatible with the constraints is the
SLy, for both the quadratic and induced inflation attractors. Thus nowadays,
scalar-tensor descriptions of neutron stars are quite scrutinized due to the

corpora have achieved impressive performance on various downstream protein
understanding tasks. Despite the ability to implicitly capture inter-residue
contact information, transformer-based PLMs cannot encode protein structures
explicitly for better structure-aware protein representations. Besides, the
power of pre-training on available protein structures has not been explored for
improving these PLMs, though structures are important to determine functions.
To tackle these limitations, in this work, we enhance the PLMs with
structure-based encoder and pre-training. We first explore feasible model
architectures to combine the advantages of a state-of-the-art PLM (i.e.,
ESM-1b1) and a state-of-the-art protein structure encoder (i.e., GearNet). We
empirically verify the ESM-GearNet that connects two encoders in a series way
as the most effective combination model. To further improve the effectiveness
of ESM-GearNet, we pre-train it on massive unlabeled protein structures with
contrastive learning, which aligns representations of co-occurring subsequences
so as to capture their biological correlation. Extensive experiments on EC and
GO protein function prediction benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of
ESM-GearNet over previous PLMs and structure encoders, and clear performance
gains are further achieved by structure-based pre-training upon ESM-GearNet.

realtime applications. In this paper, we present a non-autogressive model for
human motion prediction. We focus on learning spatio-temporal representations
non-autoregressively for generation of plausible future motions. We propose a
novel architecture that leverages the recently proposed Transformers. Human
motion involves complex spatio-temporal dynamics with joints affecting the
position and rotation of each other even though they are not connected
directly. The proposed model extracts these dynamics using both convolutions
and the self-attention mechanism. Using specialized spatial and temporal
self-attention to augment the features extracted through convolution allows our
model to generate spatio-temporally coherent predictions in parallel
independent of the activity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we frame
human motion prediction as a sequence-to-sequence problem and propose a
non-autoregressive Transformer to forecast a sequence of poses in parallel;
(ii) our method is activity agnostic; (iii) we show that despite its
simplicity, our approach is able to make accurate predictions, achieving better

This behavior can be likened to the focusing characteristics of light rays and

distributed storage systems (DSSs) with relatively low repair cost by accessing
fewer non-failure nodes. Theoretical bounds and optimal constructions of LRCs
have been widely investigated. Optimal LRCs via cyclic and constacyclic codes
provide significant benefit of elegant algebraic structure and efficient
encoding procedure. In this paper, we continue to consider the constructions of
optimal LRCs via cyclic and constacyclic codes with long code length.
Specifically, we first obtain two classes of $q$-ary cyclic Singleton-optimal
$(n, k, d=6;r=2)$-LRCs with length $n=3(q+1)$ when $3 \mid (q-1)$ and $q$ is
even, and length $n=\frac{3}{2}(q+1)$ when $3 \mid (q-1)$ and $q \equiv
1(\bmod~4)$, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
construction of $q$-ary cyclic Singleton-optimal LRCs with length $n>q+1$ and
minimum distance $d \geq 5$. On the other hand, an LRC acheiving the
Hamming-type bound is called a perfect LRC. By using cyclic and constacyclic
codes, we construct two new families of $q$-ary perfect LRCs with length
$n=\frac{q^m-1}{q-1}$, minimum distance $d=5$ and locality $r=2$.

  Inputs","33 pages, 7 figures, International Conference on Database Theory 2023",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimating quantiles, like the median or percentiles, is a fundamental task
in data mining and data science. A (streaming) quantile summary is a data
structure that can process a set S of n elements in a streaming fashion and at
the end, for any phi in (0,1], return a phi-quantile of S up to an eps error,
i.e., return a phi'-quantile with phi'=phi +- eps. We are particularly
interested in comparison-based summaries that only compare elements of the
universe under a total ordering and are otherwise completely oblivious of the
universe. The best known deterministic quantile summary is the 20-year old
Greenwald-Khanna (GK) summary that uses O((1/eps) log(eps n)) space
[SIGMOD'01]. This bound was recently proved to be optimal for all deterministic
comparison-based summaries by Cormode and Vesle\'y [PODS'20].
  In this paper, we study weighted quantiles, a generalization of the quantiles
problem, where each element arrives with a positive integer weight which
denotes the number of copies of that element being inserted. The only known
method of handling weighted inputs via GK summaries is the naive approach of
breaking each weighted element into multiple unweighted items and feeding them
one by one to the summary, which results in a prohibitively large update time
(proportional to the maximum weight of input elements).
  We give the first non-trivial extension of GK summaries for weighted inputs
and show that it takes O((1/eps) log(eps n)) space and O(log(1/eps)+ log
log(eps n)) update time per element to process a stream of length n (under some
quite mild assumptions on the range of weights and eps). En route to this, we
also simplify the original GK summaries for unweighted quantiles.

are called shakers. In recent years, some models have been proposed to detect
such shaker from evolving entities. However, limited work has focused on shaker
detection in very short term, which has many real-world applications. For
example, in financial market, it can enable both investors and governors to
quickly respond to rapid changes. Under the short-term setting, conventional
methods may suffer from limited data sample problems and are sensitive to
cynical manipulations, leading to unreliable results. Fortunately, there are
multi-attribute evolution records available, which can provide compatible and
complementary information. In this paper, we investigate how to learn reliable
influence results from the short-term multi-attribute evolution records. We
call entities with consistent influence among different views in short term as
multi-view shakers and study the new problem of multi-view shaker detection. We
identify the challenges as follows: (1) how to jointly detect short-term
shakers and model conflicting influence results among different views? (2) how
to filter spurious influence relation in each individual view for robust
influence inference? In response, a novel solution, called Robust Influence
Network from a noise-immune influence analysis perspective is proposed, where
the possible outliers are well modelled jointly with multi-view shaker
detection task. More specifically, we learn the influence relation from each
view and transform influence relation from different views into an intermediate
representation. In the meantime, we uncover both the inconsistent and spurious
outliers.

sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and
tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability,
which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the
pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated
attention scores, as $\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose
$\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all
linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We
demonstrate that the proposed reparameterization successfully prevents entropy
collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally,
we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases
exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing
additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with
$\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning,

which each buyer's utility depends only on the bundle of goods she obtains.
Many people's interests, however, are affected by their social interactions
with others. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of Fisher markets,
namely influence Fisher markets, which captures the impact of social influence
on buyers' utilities. We show that competitive equilibria in influence Fisher
markets correspond to generalized Nash equilibria in an associated pseudo-game,
which implies the existence of competitive equilibria in all influence Fisher
markets with continuous and concave utility functions. We then construct a
monotone pseudo-game, whose variational equilibria and their duals together
characterize competitive equilibria in influence Fisher markets with
continuous, jointly concave, and homogeneous utility functions. This
observation implies that competitive equilibria in these markets can be
computed in polynomial time under standard smoothness assumptions on the
utility functions. The dual of this second pseudo-game enables us to interpret
the competitive equilibria of influence CCH Fisher markets as the solutions to
a system of simultaneous Stackelberg games. Finally, we derive a novel
first-order method that solves this Stackelberg system in polynomial time,
prove that it is equivalent to computing competitive equilibrium prices via
t\^{a}tonnement, and run experiments that confirm our theoretical results.

components in the loop closing detection for 3D LiDAR Simultaneous Localization
and Mapping (SLAM). In order to find the accurate global 6-DoF transform by
feature matching approach, various end-to-end architectures have been proposed.
However, existing methods do not consider the false correspondence of the
features, thereby unnecessary features are also involved in global place
recognition and relocalization. In this paper, we introduce a robust
correspondence estimation method by removing unnecessary features and
highlighting necessary features simultaneously. To focus on the necessary
features and ignore the unnecessary ones, we use the geometric correlation
between two scenes represented in the 3D LiDAR point clouds. We introduce the
correspondence auxiliary loss that finds key correlations based on the point
align algorithm and enables end-to-end training of the proposed networks with
robust correspondence estimation. Since the ground with many plane patches acts
as an outlier during correspondence estimation, we also propose a preprocessing
step to consider negative correspondence by removing dominant plane patches.
The evaluation results on the dynamic urban driving dataset, show that our
proposed method can improve the performances of both global place recognition
and relocalization tasks. We show that estimating the robust feature
correspondence is one of the important factors in place recognition and
relocalization.

drowsiness detection which can identify the drowsiness of a driver by
identifying the face and then followed by eye tracking. The extracted eye image

reduced computational cost. In this work, a novel approach to perform the
simulation of photodetector signals from the time projection chamber of the
EXO-200 experiment is demonstrated. The method is based on a Wasserstein
Generative Adversarial Network - a deep learning technique allowing for
implicit non-parametric estimation of the population distribution for a given
set of objects. Our network is trained on real calibration data using raw
scintillation waveforms as input. We find that it is able to produce
high-quality simulated waveforms an order of magnitude faster than the
traditional simulation approach and, importantly, generalize from the training
sample and discern salient high-level features of the data. In particular, the
network correctly deduces position dependency of scintillation light response
in the detector and correctly recognizes dead photodetector channels. The
network output is then integrated into the EXO-200 analysis framework to show
that the standard EXO-200 reconstruction routine processes the simulated
waveforms to produce energy distributions comparable to that of real waveforms.
Finally, the remaining discrepancies and potential ways to improve the approach

the promising results of quadratic neurons, there is still an unresolved issue:
\textit{Is the superior performance of quadratic networks simply due to the
increased parameters or due to the intrinsic expressive capability?} Without
clarifying this issue, the performance of quadratic networks is always
suspicious. Additionally, resolving this issue is reduced to finding killer
applications of quadratic networks. In this paper, with theoretical and
empirical studies, we show that quadratic networks enjoy parametric efficiency,
thereby confirming that the superior performance of quadratic networks is due
to the intrinsic expressive capability. This intrinsic expressive ability comes
from that quadratic neurons can easily represent nonlinear interaction, while
it is hard for conventional neurons. Theoretically, we derive the approximation
efficiency of the quadratic network over conventional ones in terms of real
space and manifolds. Moreover, from the perspective of the Barron space, we
demonstrate that there exists a functional space whose functions can be
approximated by quadratic networks in a dimension-free error, but the
approximation error of conventional networks is dependent on dimensions.
Empirically, experimental results on synthetic data, classic benchmarks, and
real-world applications show that quadratic models broadly enjoy parametric
efficiency, and the gain of efficiency depends on the task.

However, near the graphene phonon frequency (~1585 cm-1), ABC's response
increases dramatically when gated and exhibits a narrow and sharp Fano-shape
resonant line, whereas the ABA trilayer is largely featherless. Consequently,
the IR contrast between ABC and ABA becomes reversed and can even be striking

collectives are enqueued in a consistent order on each GPU to prevent
deadlocks. In complex distributed DNN training scenarios, manual hardcoding is
the only practical way for deadlock prevention, which poses significant
challenges to the development of artificial intelligence. This paper presents
OCCL, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first deadlock-free
collective communication library for GPU supporting dynamic decentralized
preemption and gang-scheduling for collectives. Leveraging the preemption
opportunity of collectives on GPU, OCCL dynamically preempts collectives in a
decentralized way via the deadlock-free collective execution framework and
allows dynamic decentralized gang-scheduling via the stickiness adjustment
scheme. With the help of OCCL, researchers no longer have to struggle to get
all GPUs to launch collectives in a consistent order to prevent deadlocks. We
implement OCCL with several optimizations and integrate OCCL with a distributed
deep learning framework OneFlow. Experimental results demonstrate that OCCL
achieves comparable or better latency and bandwidth for collectives compared to
NCCL, the state-of-the-art. When used in distributed DNN training, OCCL can
improve the peak training throughput by up to 78% compared to statically
sequenced NCCL, while introducing overheads of less than 6.5% across various

geometry in smoothed particle hydrodynamics and smoothed dissipative particle
dynamics simulations. Under an assumption of linear profile of the tangential
velocity at quasi-steady state near the interface, an arbitrary slip length $b$
can be specified and correspondingly, an artificial velocity for every boundary
particle can be calculated. Therefore, $b$ as an input parameter affects the
calculation of dissipative and random forces near the interface. For $b \to 0$,
the no-slip is recovered while for $b \to \infty$, the free-slip is achieved.
Technically, we devise two different approaches to calculate the artificial
velocity of any boundary particle. The first has a succinct principle and is
competent for simple geometries, while the second is subtle and affordable for
complex geometries. Slip lengths in simulations for both steady and transient
flows coincide with the expected ones. As demonstration, we apply the two
approaches extensively to simulate curvy channel flows, dynamics of an
ellipsoid in pipe flow and flows within complex microvessels, where desired
slip lengths at fluid-solid interfaces are prescribed. The proposed methodology
may apply equally well to other particle methods such as dissipative particle
dynamics and moving particle semi-implicit methods.

of the first galaxies. Encouragingly, if assuming expected properties for
typical first galaxies (i.e., dust-to-metal mass ratio: $D/M = 5 \times
10^{-3}$, gas metallicity: $Z_{\rm g} = 5 \times 10^{-3}~Z_{\odot}$, star

consistent with current upper flux limits inferred from ALMA bands 6 and 7

with some scenarios proposed in the literature to explain the non-detection of
the FIR dust continuum for high-$z$ JWST galaxy candidates. On the other hand,
higher values of model parameters $D/M$ ($\gtrsim 0.06$) and $Z_{\rm g}$

level is chosen arbitrarily. However, the impact of density reduction on the
detection performance and memory consumption remains largely unknown. In this
paper, we aim to address this issue by conducting extensive hyperparamter
tuning on the density reduction level. Experimental results show that
increasing the density level from 0.01% to 50% of the original 4DRT density
level proportionally improves the detection performance, at a cost of memory

when task-specific node labels are available. However, obtaining labels for
graphs is expensive in many applications. This is particularly the case for
large graphs. To address this, there has been a body of work to learn node
representations in a self-supervised manner without labels. Contrastive
learning (CL), has been particularly popular to learn representations in a
self-supervised manner. In general, CL methods work by maximizing the
similarity between representations of augmented views of the same example, and
minimizing the similarity between augmented views of different examples.
However, existing graph CL methods cannot learn high-quality representations
under heterophily, where connected nodes tend to belong to different classes.
This is because under heterophily, augmentations of the same example may not be
similar to each other. In this work, we address the above problem by proposing
the first graph CL method, HLCL, for learning node representations, under
heterophily. HLCL uses a high-pass and a low-pass graph filter to generate
different views of the same node. Then, it contrasts the two filtered views to
learn the final node representations. Effectively, the high-pass filter
captures the dissimilarity between nodes in a neighborhood and the low-pass
filter captures the similarity between neighboring nodes.Contrasting the two
filtered views allows HLCL to learn rich node representations for graphs, under
heterophily and homophily.Empirically, HLCL outperforms state-of-the-art graph

With the aim of producing high-quality masks, existing methods often adopt
iterative learning approaches that rely on RNNs or stacked attention layers to
refine vision-language features. Despite their complexity, RNN-based methods
are subject to specific encoder choices, while attention-based methods offer
limited gains. In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective alternative
for progressively learning discriminative multi-modal features. The core idea
of our approach is to leverage a continuously updated query as the
representation of the target object and at each iteration, strengthen
multi-modal features strongly correlated to the query while weakening less
related ones. As the query is initialized by language features and successively
updated by object features, our algorithm gradually shifts from being
localization-centric to segmentation-centric. This strategy enables the
incremental recovery of missing object parts and/or removal of extraneous parts
through iteration. Compared to its counterparts, our method is more
versatile$\unicode{x2014}$it can be plugged into prior arts straightforwardly
and consistently bring improvements. Experimental results on the challenging
datasets of RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and G-Ref demonstrate its advantage with respect

Understanding human actions in RGB videos has been widely studied in recent

increasing attention due to its significant importance in boosting user
engagement. However, training the RL policy from scratch without hurting users'
experience is unavoidable due to the requirement of trial-and-error searches.
Furthermore, the offline methods, which aim to optimize the policy without
online interactions, suffer from the notorious stability problem in value
estimation or unbounded variance in counterfactual policy evaluation. To this
end, we propose optimizing user retention with Decision Transformer~(DT), which
avoids the offline difficulty by translating the RL as an autoregressive
problem. However, deploying the DT in recommendation is a non-trivial problem
because of the following challenges: (1) deficiency in modeling the numerical
reward value; (2) data discrepancy between the policy learning and
recommendation generation; (3) unreliable offline performance evaluation. In
this work, we, therefore, contribute a series of strategies for tackling the
exposed issues. We first articulate an efficient reward prompt by weighted
aggregation of meta embeddings for informative reward embedding. Then, we endow
a weighted contrastive learning method to solve the discrepancy between
training and inference. Furthermore, we design two robust offline metrics to
measure user retention. Finally, the significant improvement in the benchmark

exploitation, i.e., re-visiting previously-located targets, and exploration,

influences from the macroscopic environment. In conclusion, indeterminism and

artifacts fail CCTA in obtaining lumen morphological characteristics and plaque
composition. It can be settled by invasive optical coherence tomography (OCT)
without much trouble for physicians, but bringing higher costs and potential
risks to patients. Therefore, it is clinically critical to introduce
annotations of plaque tissue and lumen characteristics from OCT to paired CCTA
scans, denoted as \textbf{the O2CTA problem} in this paper. We propose a method
to handle the O2CTA problem. CCTA scans are first reconstructed into
multi-planar reformatted (MPR) images, which agree with OCT images in term of
semantic contents. The artery segment in OCT, which is manually labelled, is
then spatially aligned with the entire artery in MPR images via the proposed
alignment strategy. Finally, a classification model involving a 3D CNN and a
Transformer, is learned to extract local features and capture dependence along
arteries. Experiments on 55 paired OCT and CCTA we curate demonstrate that it
is feasible to classify the CCTA based on the OCT labels, with an accuracy of
86.2%, while the manual readings of OCT and CCTA vary significantly, with a
Kappa coefficient of 0.113. We will make our source codes, models, data, and

large-scale macroecological and biogeographical processes. Existing methods
studying such spatio-temporally structured data either simplify the dynamic
structure or the complex interactions of ecological drivers. This paper aims to
present a generic method for ecological research that allows analysing
spatio-temporal patterns of biological processes at large spatial scales by
including the time-varying variables that drive these dynamics. Methods: We
introduce a method called relational event modelling (REM), which relies on
temporal interaction dynamics, that encode sequences of relational events
connecting a sender node to a recipient node at a specific point in time. We
apply REM to the spread of alien species around the globe between 1880 and
2005, following accidental or deliberate introductions into geographical
regions outside of their native range. In this context, a relational event
represents the new occurrence of an alien species given its former
distribution. Results: The application of REM to the first reported invasions
of 4835 established alien species outside of their native ranges from four
major taxonomic groups enables us to unravel the main drivers of the dynamics
of the spread of invasive alien species. Combining the alien species first
records data with other spatio-temporal information enables us to discover
which factors have been responsible for the spread of species across the globe.
Besides the usual drivers of species invasions, such as trade, land use and
climatic conditions, we also find evidence for species-interconnectedness in
alien species spread. Conclusions: REM offer the capacity to account for the
temporal sequences of ecological events such as biological invasions and to
investigate how relationships between these events and potential drivers change
over time.

the amount of ejected mass and its properties during ejection. Through our
r-process calculations, we estimate the composition of this gravitationally
unbound material, which can contribute to the r-process enrichment of the
Galaxy. This work is divided into two studies, each addressing a remaining open
question regarding the r-process nucleosynthesis. First, a coherent study of
the impact of neutrino interactions on the r-process element nucleosynthesis

during performance of a cognitive task. In studying brain signals such as
electroencephalograms (EEG), this may be explored via an information-theoretic
causal measure, called transfer entropy (TE), which does not impose any
distributional assumption on the variables and covers any form of relationship
(beyond linear) between them. To improve utility of TE in brain signal
analysis, we propose a novel methodology to capture cross-channel information
transfer in the frequency domain. Specifically, we introduce a new causal
measure, the spectral transfer entropy (STE), to quantify the magnitude and
direction of information flow from a certain frequency-band oscillation of a
channel to an oscillation of another channel. In contrast with previous works
on TE in the frequency domain, we differentiate our work by considering an
extreme value perspective that employs the maximum magnitude of filtered series
within time blocks. The main advantages of our proposed approach is that it is
robust to the inherent problems of linear filtering and allows adjustments for
multiple comparisons to control family-wise error rate (FWER). Another novel
contribution is a simple yet efficient estimation method based on the
combination vine copulas and extreme value theory that enables estimates to
capture zero (boundary point) without the need for bias adjustments. With the
vine copula representation, a null copula model, which exhibits zero STE, is
defined, making significance testing for STE straightforward through a standard
resampling approach. Lastly, we illustrate the advantage of our proposed
measure through some numerical experiments and provide interesting and novel

Inside CSs the
density is so high that matter is in subatomic form composed of nucleons. With
increase of density of matter towards the centre of the objects other degrees
of freedom like hyperons, heavier non-strange baryons, meson condensates may
appear. Not only that at higher densities, the nucleons may get decomposed into
quarks and form deconfined strange quark matter (SQM). If it is so then CSs may
contain SQM in the core surrounded by nucleonic matter forming hybrid stars
(HSs). However, the nature and composition of matter inside CSs can only be
inferred from the astrophysical observations of these CSs. Recent astrophysical
observations in terms of CS mass-radius (M-R) relation and gravitational wave
(GW) observation indicate that the matter should be soft in the intermediate
density range and stiff enough at higher density range to attain the maximum
possible mass above $2~M_\odot$ which is not compatible with pure hadronic
equation of states (EOSs). Consequently, we study the HS properties with
different models of SQM and find that within vector bag model considering
density dependent bag parameter, the model goes well with the astrophysical
observations so far.

unsupervised pre-training in 3D scene understanding tasks. However, most
existing work randomly selects point features as anchors while building
contrast, leading to a clear bias toward background points that often dominate
in 3D scenes. Also, object awareness and foreground-to-background
discrimination are neglected, making contrastive learning less effective. To
tackle these issues, we propose a general foreground-aware feature contrast
(FAC) framework to learn more effective point cloud representations in
pre-training. FAC consists of two novel contrast designs to construct more
effective and informative contrast pairs. The first is building positive pairs
within the same foreground segment where points tend to have the same
semantics. The second is that we prevent over-discrimination between 3D
segments/objects and encourage foreground-to-background distinctions at the
segment level with adaptive feature learning in a Siamese correspondence
network, which adaptively learns feature correlations within and across point
cloud views effectively. Visualization with point activation maps shows that
our contrast pairs capture clear correspondences among foreground regions
during pre-training. Quantitative experiments also show that FAC achieves
superior knowledge transfer and data efficiency in various downstream 3D
semantic segmentation and object detection tasks.

  internal perturbations","13 pages, 14 figures",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Disc stars from the Gaia DR3 RVS sample are selected to explore the phase
spiral as a function of position in the Galaxy. The data reveal a two-armed
phase spiral pattern in the local $z-v_z$ plane inside the solar radius, which
appears clearly when colour-coded by $\langle v_R \rangle (z,v_z)$: this is
characteristic of a breathing mode that can in principle be produced by
in-plane non-axisymmetric perturbations. We note that, on the contrary, the
phase spiral pattern becomes single armed when outside the solar radius. When a
realistic analytic model with an axisymmetric background potential plus a
realistic steadily rotating central bar and 2-armed spiral arms as perturbation
is used to perform particle test integrations, the pseudo stars get a prominent
spiral pattern in the $\langle v_R \rangle$ map in the $x-y$ plane.
Additionally, clear breathing mode evidence at a few $\rm{kms}^{-1}$ level can
be seen in the $\langle v_z \rangle$ map on the $x-z$ plane, confirming that
such breathing modes are non-negligible in the joint presence of a bar and
spiral arms. However, no phase-spiral is perceptible in the $(z, v_z)$ plane.
When an initial vertical perturbation is added to all pseudo stars and the same
orbital integrating scheme is adopted to carry out the simulation, we find that
phase spirals can clearly be seen 500~Myr after the perturbation and gradually
disappear inside-out; in that case, they are, however, one-armed. Finally, we
show as a proof of concept how a toy model of a time-varying non-axisymmetric
in-plane perturbation with varying amplitude and pattern speed can, on the
other hand, produce a strong two-armed phase-spiral. We conclude that a
time-varying strong internal perturbation together with an external vertical
perturbation could perhaps explain the transition between the two-armed and
one-armed phase-spirals around the Solar radius.

Deep Neural Network (DNN). To overcome this, a univariate time series is
decomposed into simpler constituent series, whose sum equals the original
series. As demonstrated in this article, the conventional one-time
decomposition technique suffers from a leak of information from the future,
referred to as a data leak. In this work, a novel Moving Front (MF) method is
proposed to prevent data leakage, so that the decomposed series can be treated
like other time series. Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR) is a very complex
time series, which poses a challenge to DNN and is therefore selected as an
example. From the many signal processing tools available, Empirical Wavelet
Transform (EWT) was chosen for decomposing the ISMR into simpler constituent
series, as it was found to be more effective than the other popular algorithm,
Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN).
The proposed MF method was used to generate the constituent leakage-free time
series. Predictions and forecasts were made by state-of-the-art Long and
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network architecture, especially suitable for making
predictions of sequential patterns. The constituent MF series has been divided
into training, testing, and forecasting. It has been found that the model
(EWT-MF-LSTM) developed here made exceptionally good train and test
predictions, as well as Walk-Forward Validation (WFV), forecasts with
Performance Parameter ($PP$) values of 0.99, 0.86, and 0.95, respectively,

against an unrestricted adversary. The objective is to allocate resources
equitably among several agents in an online fashion so that the difference of
the aggregate $\alpha$-fair utilities of the agents between an optimal static
clairvoyant allocation and that of the online policy grows sub-linearly with
time. The problem is challenging due to the non-additive nature of the
$\alpha$-fairness function. Previously, it was shown that no online policy can
exist for this problem with a sublinear standard regret. In this paper, we
propose an efficient online resource allocation policy, called Online
Proportional Fair (OPF), that achieves $c_\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret
with the approximation factor $c_\alpha=(1-\alpha)^{-(1-\alpha)}\leq 1.445,$
for $0\leq \alpha < 1$. The upper bound to the $c_\alpha$-regret for this
problem exhibits a surprising phase transition phenomenon. The regret bound
changes from a power-law to a constant at the critical exponent
$\alpha=\frac{1}{2}.$ As a corollary, our result also resolves an open problem
raised by Even-Dar et al. [2009] on designing an efficient no-regret policy for
the online job scheduling problem in certain parameter regimes. The proof of
our results introduces new algorithmic and analytical techniques, including
greedy estimation of the future gradients for non-additive global reward

magneto-oscillations to Lifshitz transitions in graphene superlattices, where
they persist even at relatively low fields and very much above liquid-helium

cyclotron trajectories that form a kagom\'e-shaped network characteristic for
Lifshitz transitions. In contrast to Shubnikov - de Haas oscillations, the
kagom\'e oscillations are robust against thermal smearing and they can be

traditional PatchMatch algorithms such as ACMMP, OpenMVS, and RealityCapture

sensing based on Rydberg atoms has the potential to replace its traditional
counterparts with higher sensitivity and has developed rapidly in recent years.
However, as the most sensitive atomic radio wave sensor, the atomic
superheterodyne receiver lacks a detailed noise analysis to pave its way to
achieve theoretical sensitivity. In this work, we quantitatively study the
noise power spectrum of the atomic receiver versus the number of atoms, where
the number of atoms is precisely controlled by changing the diameters of
flat-top excitation laser beams. The results show that under the experimental
conditions that the diameters of excitation beams are less than or equal to 2
mm and the read-out frequency is larger than 70 kHz, the sensitivity of the
atomic receiver is limited only by the quantum noise and, in the other
conditions, limited by classical noises. However, the experimental
quantum-projection-noise-limited sensitivity this atomic receiver reaches is
far from the theoretical sensitivity. This is because all atoms involved in
light-atom interaction will contribute to noise, but only a fraction of them
participating in the radio wave transition can provide valuable signals. At the
same time, the calculation of the theoretical sensitivity considers both the
noise and signal are contributed by the same amount of atoms. This work is
essential in making the sensitivity of the atomic receiver reach its ultimate
limit and is significant in quantum precision measurement.

literature devoted to accurately assessing statistics of QoI, and in
particular, multilevel or multifidelity approaches are known to be effective,
leveraging cost-accuracy tradeoffs between a given ensemble of models. However,
effective algorithms that can estimate the full distribution of outputs are
still under active development. In this paper, we introduce a general
multifidelity framework for estimating the cumulative distribution functions
(CDFs) of vector-valued QoI associated with a high-fidelity model under a
budget constraint. Given a family of appropriate control variates obtained from
lower fidelity surrogates, our framework involves identifying the most
cost-effective model subset and then using it to build an approximate control
variates estimator for the target CDF. We instantiate the framework by
constructing a family of control variates using intermediate linear
approximators and rigorously analyze the corresponding algorithm. Our analysis
reveals that the resulting CDF estimator is uniformly consistent and
budget-asymptotically optimal, with only mild moment and regularity
assumptions. The approach provides a robust multifidelity CDF estimator that is
adaptive to the available budget, does not require \textit{a priori} knowledge
of cross-model statistics or model hierarchy, and is applicable to general
output dimensions. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the approach

collapse and misalignment with inference stage while stochastic quantization
suffers from low codebook utilization and perturbed reconstruction objective.
This paper presents a regularized vector quantization framework that allows to
mitigate above issues effectively by applying regularization from two
perspectives. The first is a prior distribution regularization which measures
the discrepancy between a prior token distribution and the predicted token
distribution to avoid codebook collapse and low codebook utilization. The
second is a stochastic mask regularization that introduces stochasticity during
quantization to strike a good balance between inference stage misalignment and
unperturbed reconstruction objective. In addition, we design a probabilistic
contrastive loss which serves as a calibrated metric to further mitigate the

However, in practice, the trained DCNN models are often fooled by the AEs
generated by the novel attack methods. This naturally raises a question: can a
DCNN model learn certain features which are insensitive to small perturbations,
and further defend itself no matter what attack methods are presented. To
answer this question, this paper makes a beginning effort by proposing a
shallow binary feature module (SBFM for short), which can be integrated into
any popular backbone. The SBFM includes two types of layers, i.e., Sobel layer
and threshold layer. In Sobel layer, there are four parallel feature maps which
represent horizontal, vertical, and diagonal edge features, respectively. And
in threshold layer, it turns the edge features learnt by Sobel layer to the
binary features, which then are feeded into the fully connected layers for
classification with the features learnt by the backbone. We integrate SBFM into
VGG16 and ResNet34, respectively, and conduct experiments on multiple datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate, under FGSM attack with $\epsilon=8/255$, the
SBFM integrated models can achieve averagely 35\% higher accuracy than the
original ones, and in CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet datasets, the SBFM integrated
models can achieve averagely 75\% classification accuracy. The work in this

arteries in the brain, the blood-brain barrier makes the medical treatment
difficult. There is a need of expanding the diameters of the arteries in order
to facilitate the transport of medicaments. Recent research has pointed to
various ways to improve this situation; in particular, the use ultrasound
acting on microbubbles in the blood stream has turned out to be a promising
option. Here, a different possibility of enlarging the diameters of arteries is
discussed, namely to exploit the electrostrictive pressure produced by internal
strong, ultrashort and repetitive laser pulses. Each pulse will at first give
rise to inward directed optical forces, and once the pulse terminates there
will be a hydrodynamical bouncing flow in the outward radial direction giving
an outward impulse to the vessel wall. In the absence of friction a symmetric
oscillation picture emerges. Clearly, a supply of repetitive pulses will be
needed (at parametric resonance) to make the effect appreciable. The effect has
to our knowledge not been discussed before. We give an approximate optical and
hydrodynamical theory of it. The calculations indicate promising results for
the wall pressure, although experimental work is desirable to show whether the
idea can be useful in practice. Our calculation is made from a general physical
perspective, not necessarily linked to medical applications.

everyday operations and cause significant economic loss. Anomaly detection in
power grids aims to detect and discriminate anomalies caused by cyber attacks
against the power system, which is essential for keeping power grids working
correctly and efficiently. Different methods have been applied for anomaly
detection, such as statistical methods and machine learning-based methods.
Usually, machine learning-based methods need to model the normal data
distribution. In this work, we propose a novel anomaly detection method by
modeling the data distribution of normal samples via multiple encoders and
decoders. Specifically, the proposed method maps input samples into a latent
space and then reconstructs output samples from latent vectors. The extra
encoder finally maps reconstructed samples to latent representations. During
the training phase, we optimize parameters by minimizing the reconstruction
loss and encoding loss. Training samples are re-weighted to focus more on
missed correlations between features of normal data. Furthermore, we employ the
long short-term memory model as encoders and decoders to test its
effectiveness. We also investigate a meta-learning-based framework for
hyper-parameter tuning of our approach. Experiment results on network intrusion
and power system datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method,
where our models consistently outperform all baselines.

the broader society. While professional fact-checkers form the first line of
defense by fact-checking popular false claims, they do not engage directly in
conversations with misinformation spreaders. On the other hand, non-expert
ordinary users act as eyes-on-the-ground who proactively counter misinformation
-- recent research has shown that 96% counter-misinformation responses are made
by ordinary users. However, research also found that 2/3 times, these responses
are rude and lack evidence. This work seeks to create a counter-misinformation
response generation model to empower users to effectively correct
misinformation. This objective is challenging due to the absence of datasets
containing ground-truth of ideal counter-misinformation responses, and the lack
of models that can generate responses backed by communication theories. In this
work, we create two novel datasets of misinformation and counter-misinformation
response pairs from in-the-wild social media and crowdsourcing from
college-educated students. We annotate the collected data to distinguish poor
from ideal responses that are factual, polite, and refute misinformation. We
propose MisinfoCorrect, a reinforcement learning-based framework that learns to
generate counter-misinformation responses for an input misinformation post. The
model rewards the generator to increase the politeness, factuality, and
refutation attitude while retaining text fluency and relevancy. Quantitative
and qualitative evaluation shows that our model outperforms several baselines
by generating high-quality counter-responses. This work illustrates the promise
of generative text models for social good -- here, to help create a safe and

In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards the use of vibration
signals in the field of bioengineering. Activity-induced structural vibrations,
particularly footstep-induced signals, are useful for analyzing the movement of
biological systems such as the human body and animals, providing valuable
information regarding an individual's gait, body mass, and posture, making them
an attractive tool for health monitoring, security, and human-computer
interaction. However, the presence of various types of noise can compromise the
accuracy of footstep-induced signal analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel
ensemble model that leverages both the ensemble of multiple signals and of
recurrent and convolutional neural network predictions. The proposed model
consists of three stages: preprocessing, hybrid modeling, and ensemble. In the
preprocessing stage, features are extracted using the Fast Fourier Transform
and wavelet transform to capture the underlying physics-governed dynamics of
the system and extract spatial and temporal features. In the hybrid modeling
stage, a bi-directional LSTM is used to denoise the noisy signal concatenated
with FFT results, and a CNN is used to obtain a condensed feature
representation of the signal. In the ensemble stage, three layers of a
fully-connected neural network are used to produce the final denoised signal.
The proposed model addresses the challenges associated with structural

operating in Bangladesh for the period of 2010-2014, are used to estimate
long-run relationships among the variables. The macroeconomic variables are
included The profitability of banks, GDP, banks' lending to private sector, Net
Stable Funding Ratio, Tier 1 capital Ratio, Interest rate spread, real interest
rate. The cost is quantified using Driscoll and Kraay panel data models with
fixed effect. Impact of higher capital and liquidity requirement on Interest
rate spread and lending to private sector of banks were considered as the cost
to the economy as a whole whereas impact of higher capital and liquidity
requirement on profitability of banks(ROE) was considered as the cost of banks.
Here it is found that, the interest rate level is positively affected by the
tighter liquidity and capital requirements which driven toward lessen of the
private sector lending of banks. The return on equity of banks varies
negatively with the liquidity and capital. The economic costs are considerably
below the estimated positive benefit that the reform should have by reducing
the probability of banking crises and the associated banking losses (BCBS,
2010b).

  algorithms",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many efforts have succeeded over the last decade at lengthening the timescale
in which spin qubits loss quantum information under free evolution. With these
design principles, it is now timely to zoom out and take the whole picture:
concerning applications that require user-driven evolutions, qubits should be
assessed within the desired algorithm. This means to test qubits under external
control while relaxation is active, and to maximize the algorithm fidelity as
the actual figure of merit. Herein, we pose and analytically solve a master
equation devised to run one-spin-qubit algorithms subject to relaxation. It is
handled via a code, QBithm, which inputs gate sequences and relaxation rates
thus connecting with the longstanding work devoted to their ab initio
computation. We calculate fidelities against relaxation and imperfections, and
implement well-known pulse sequences quantitatively agreeing with experimental
data. Hopefully, this work will stimulate the study of many-qubit systems
driven under relaxation and imperfections in quantum algorithms.

its temperature dependent energy output. The main reactions for generation and
annihilation of oxygen and fluorine are coupled in the reaction equations while
nitrogen is produced as a decay product. We find that the governing set of
equations for F18(p, alpha)O15 process in the phase diagram exhibit a
predominance of the direct reaction rather than the reverse reaction consuming
O15. The time-scale determined by the exact solution of this system yields
relatively short time-scale conversion of fluorine into oxygen indicating an
energy generation of 2.8MeV per reaction. The temperature dependence shows that
the effective reaction occurs at temperature about 0.04GK or above.

  electrodeposition method and alpha spectroscopy","11 pages, 5 figures, 1 table",,,,"physics.ins-det nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A thin coating of thorium on aluminium substrates with the areal density of
110 to 130 $\mu g/cm^2$ is developed over a circular area of 22 mm diameter by
using the electrodeposition method. An electrodeposition system is fabricated
to consist of three components; an anode made of a platinum mesh, a
cylindrical-shape vessel to contain the thorium solution, and a cathode in the
form of a circular aluminium plate. The aluminium plate is mounted
horizontally, and the platinum mesh is connected to an axial rod of an electric
motor, mounted vertically and normal to the plane of the aluminium. The
electrolyte solution is prepared by dissolving a known-weight thorium nitrate
powder in 0.8 M HNO3 and isopropanol. The system is operated either in constant
voltage (CV) or constant current (CC) mode. Under the electric field between
the anode and cathode, thorium ions were deposited on the aluminium substrate
mounted on the cathode. In the CV mode at 320, 360, and 400 V and in the CC
mode at 15 mA, thorium films were formed over a circular area of the aluminium
substrate. The areal density of thorium coating was measured by detecting
emitted alpha particles. The areal density of thorium varied from 80 to 130
$\mu g/cm^2$ by changing the deposition time from 10 to 60 min. The results
from the CV mode and CC mode are compared, and the radial dependence in the
measured areal density is discussed for different modes of the electric field.
The developed thorium coatings are to be used in the in-house development of
particle detectors, fast neutron converters, targets for thorium fission
experiments, and other purposes.

equations with source terms. The primary unknowns are velocities and deviatoric
stresses. By casting the governing equations into a vector-matrix form, we
derive the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix to show the wave speeds. The
eigenvalues are also used to calculate the Courant number for numerical
stability. The model equations are solved using the Space-Time Conservation
Element and Solution Element (CESE) method. The approach is validated by
comparing our numerical results to an analytical solution for the special case
of longitudinal wave motion.

  problems","Masters thesis",,,,"math.NA cs.NA math.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This thesis aims at investigating the first steps toward an unconditionally
stable space-time isogeometric method, based on splines of maximal regularity,
for the linear acoustic wave equation. The unconditional stability of
space-time discretizations for wave propagation problems is a topic of
significant interest, by virtue of the advantages of space-time methods
compared with more standard time-stepping techniques. In the case of continuous
finite element methods, several stabilizations have been proposed. Inspired by
one of these works, we address the stability issue by studying the isogeometric
method for an ordinary differential equation closely related to the wave
equation. As a result, we provide a stabilized isogeometric method whose
effectiveness is supported by numerical tests. Motivated by these results, we
conclude by suggesting an extension of this stabilization tool to the
space-time isogeometric formulation of the acoustic wave equation.

has emerged as a viable route towards realizing novel optoelectronic devices.
However, the low light absorption due to their small absorption cross section,
limits their realistic application. While light-matter interaction mediated by
strong exciton-plasmon coupling has been demonstrated to improve absorbance and
spontaneous emission in a coupled TMDC and metallic nanostructures, the
fabrication of tunable broadband phototransistor with high quantum yield is
still a challenging task. By synthesizing Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs) capped with
a thin layer of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) through chemical route, we report a
lithography-free fabrication of a large area broadband superior gate-tunable
hybrid phototransistor based on monolayer graphene decorated by WS$_2$-Ag NPs
in a three-terminal device configuration. The fabricated device exhibits
extremely high photoresponsivity (up to $3.2\times 10^4$ A/W) which is more
than 5 times higher than the bare graphene/WS$_2$ hybrid device, along with a
low noise equivalent power (NEP) (~10$^{-13}$ W/Hz$^{0.5}$, considering 1/f
noise) and high specific detectivity ~1010 Jones in the wide (325-730 nm)
wavelength region. The additional PVP capping of Ag NPs helps to suppress the
direct charge and heat transfer and most importantly, increases the device
stability by preventing the degradation of WS$_2$-Ag hybrid system. The
enhanced optical properties of the hybrid device are explained via dipole
mediated strong exciton-plasmon coupling, corroborated by COMSOL Multiphysics
simulation. Our work demonstrates a strategy towards obtaining an
environment-friendly, scalable, high-performance broadband phototransistor by
tuning the exciton-plasmon coupling for new generation opto-electronic devices.

optimal search strategy, thus providing a novel paradigm for predicting the
maximum-likelihood tree. Our proposed method does not require likelihood
calculation with every step, nor is it limited to greedy uphill moves in the
likelihood space. We demonstrate the use of the developed deep-Q-learning agent

nucleotide alignments of up to 20 sequences. Our results show that the
likelihood scores of the inferred phylogenies are similar to those obtained
from widely-used software. It thus establishes a proof-of-concept that it is
beneficial to optimize a sequence of moves in the search-space, rather than
optimizing the progress made in every single move only. This suggests that a
reinforcement-learning based method provides a promising direction for

strategies to pre-train the trajectory encoder and map encoder, allowing for
the capture of social and temporal information among agents while leveraging
the effect of environment from multiple granularities. To address the
catastrophic forgetting problem that arises when pre-training the network with

into account the cost of correcting an unsatisfiable prediction. Since Post-hoc
Regret is non-differentiable, the previous work computes only its
approximation. While the notion of Post-hoc Regret is general, its specific
implementation is applicable to only packing and covering linear programming
problems. In this paper, we first show how to compute Post-hoc Regret exactly

phase offset of quantum oscillations, which is extracted from a ""Landau fan

shown that the famous $\pi$-phase shift can equally well arise from orbital- or
spin magnetic moments in topologically trivial systems with strong spin-orbit
coupling or small effective masses. Therefore, the ""Landau fan plot"" does not
by itself constitute a proof of a topologically nontrivial Fermi surface. In
the paper at hand, we report an improved analysis method that exploits the
strong energy-dependence of the effective mass in linearly dispersing bands.
This leads to a characteristic temperature dependence of the oscillation
frequency which is a strong indicator of nontrivial topology, even for
multi-band metals with complex Fermi surfaces. Three materials, Cd$_3$As$_2$,
Bi$_2$O$_2$Se and LaRhIn$_5$ served as test cases for this method. Linear band

vascular-based thermal regulation is attractive for thin microvascular systems.
Although preliminary designs and experiments demonstrate the feasibility of
thermal modulation by pushing fluid through embedded micro-vasculatures, one
has yet to optimize the performance before translating the concept into
real-world applications. It will be beneficial to know how two vital design
variables -- host material's thermal conductivity and fluid's heat capacity
rate -- affect a thermal regulation system's performance, quantified in terms
of the mean surface temperature. This paper fills the remarked inadequacy by
performing adjoint-based sensitivity analysis and unravels a surprising
non-monotonic trend. Increasing thermal conductivity can either increase or
decrease the mean surface temperature; the increase happens if countercurrent
heat exchange -- transfer of heat from one segment of the vasculature to
another -- is significant. In contrast, increasing the heat capacity rate will
invariably lower the mean surface temperature, for which we provide
mathematical proof. The reported results (a) dispose of some misunderstandings
in the literature, especially on the effect of the host material's thermal
conductivity, (b) reveal the role of countercurrent heat exchange in altering
the effects of design variables, and (c) guide designers to realize efficient

settings in the transient regime and also in equilibrium if we replace the bath
attached to the cold qubit by a non-Markovian reservoir. We also consider
refrigeration with more than one non-Markovian bath of the three-qubit
refrigerating device. Curiously, a steady temperature is reached only if there
are at least two Markovian environments, although there are distinct envelopes
of the temperature oscillations in all cases. We compare the device connected
to one or more non-Markovian reservoirs with the case of all Markovian
environs, as also with two- and single-qubit self-sustained devices connected
to one or more non-Markovian baths. We propose a measure to quantify the amount
of non-Markovianity in the systems. Finally, the refrigerator models are
studied in presence of Markovian noise, and we analyse the response on the
refrigeration of the noise strength. In particular, we find the noise strength
until which refrigeration remains possible.

various strategies being explored for decision-making in autonomous vehicles.
Rule-based systems, decision trees, Markov decision processes, and Bayesian
networks have been some of the popular methods used to tackle the complexities
of traffic conditions and avoid collisions. However, with the emergence of deep
learning, many researchers have turned towards CNN-based methods to improve the
performance of collision avoidance. Despite the promising results achieved by
some CNN-based methods, the failure to establish correlations between
sequential images often leads to more collisions. In this paper, we propose a
CNN-based method that overcomes the limitation by establishing feature
correlations between regions in sequential images using variants of attention.
Our method combines the advantages of CNN in capturing regional features with a
bi-directional LSTM to enhance the relationship between different local areas.
Additionally, we use an encoder to improve computational efficiency. Our method
takes ""Bird's Eye View"" graphs generated from camera and LiDAR sensors as
input, simulates the position (x, y) and head offset angle (Yaw) to generate
future trajectories. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms existing vision-based strategies, achieving an average of only 3.7
collisions per 1000 miles of driving distance on the L5kit test set. This
significantly improves the success rate of collision avoidance and provides a
promising solution for autonomous driving.

$C=[x_{1}]\times[x_{2}]\times\ldots [x_{d}]$ where
$x_{1},\ldots,x_{d}\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, we classify exactly which $A$ of size

the size of $C$ equals $|A|\cdot|B|$, and where we assume $(A,B)$ is some

The trivial bounds for this value are very poor, with a lower bound of roughly
$\log n$ and an upper bound of $n$ choose $n/2$. We improve these bounds in the

$n^{\omega(1)}$ respectively (where $n=|C|$). Lastly, we use analysis from the

this work we study quantum algorithms for simulating stochastic processes which
are compatible with Monte Carlo methods. We introduce a new ``analog'' quantum

exponentially efficient encoding of process trajectories.
  We show that this representation allows for highly efficient quantum

  In particular, we show that we can simulate $T$ timesteps of fractional

challenging problem as it requires incorporating the data's qualities within
the database engine. Even more challenging, the qualities are typically not
static and may evolve over time. Unfortunately, most of the state-of-art
techniques deal with the data quality problem as an offline task that is in
total isolation of the query processing engine (carried out outside the DBMS).
Hence, end-users will receive the queries' results with no clue on whether or
not the results can be trusted for further analysis and decision making. In
this paper, we propose the it ""QTrail-DB"" system that fundamentally extends the
standard DBMSs to support imperfect databases with evolving qualities.
QTrail-DB introduces a new quality model based on the new concept of ""Quality
Trails"", which captures the evolution of the data's qualities over time.
QTrail-DB extends the relational data model to incorporate the quality trails
within the database system. We propose a new query algebra, called ""QTrail
Algebra"", that enables seamless and transparent propagation and derivations of
the data's qualities within a query pipeline. As a result, a query's answer
will be automatically annotated with quality-related information at the tuple
level. QTrail-DB propagation model leverages the thoroughly-studied propagation
semantics present in the DB provenance and lineage tracking literature, and
thus there is no need for developing a new query optimizer. QTrail-DB is
developed within PostgreSQL and experimentally evaluated using real-world

KI67 WSI are available, resulting in 544 WSIs with invasive cancer annotations.
We find that cancer detection CNNs that were trained with annotations
registered from the H&E to the KI67 WSIs only differ slightly in calibration
but not in performance compared to cancer detection models trained on
annotations made directly in the KI67 WSIs in a test set consisting of 54

new target-of-opportunity X-ray observations with Chandra. No strong absorption
is detected in either the bright or the faint state X-ray spectra. The
intrinsic X-ray flux generally tracks the optical variability, and the X-ray
power-law slope becomes harder in the faint state. Large amplitude mid-infrared
variability is detected in all five CLQs. The changing-obscuration model is not
consistent with the observed X-ray spectra and spectral energy distribution
changes seen in these CLQs. It is highly likely that the observed changes are
due to the changing accretion rate of the supermassive black hole, so the
multiwavelength emission varies accordingly, with promising analogies to the
accretion states of X-ray binaries.

Arrays of 700 nm diamond-shape nanodots consisting of Py(30 nm)/Ru(tRu)/Py(30

lithography and e-beam evaporation. We show that varying the Ru interlayer
spacer thickness (tRu) governs the interaction between the Py layers. We found
this interaction mainly mediated by two mechanisms: magnetostatic interaction
that favors antiparallel (antiferromagnetic, AFM) alignment of the Py layers
and exchange interaction that oscillates between ferromagnetic (FM) and AFM
couplings. For a certain range of Ru thicknesses, FM coupling dominates and
forms magnetic vortices in the upper and lower Py layers. For Ru thicknesses at
which AFM coupling dominates, the magnetic state in remanence is a double pole
structure. Our results showed that the interlayer exchange coupling interaction
remains finite even at 4 nm Ru thickness. The magnetic states in remanence,
observed by Magnetic Force Microscopy (MFM), are in good agreement with
corresponding hysteresis loops obtained by Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (MOKE) and

metallic materials is an essential practical topic. Ductile damage and its
precursors are represented by extreme values in stress and material state
quantities, the spatial PDF of which are highly non-Gaussian with strong fat
tails. Traditional deterministic forecasts using physical models often fail to
capture the statistics of structural evolution during material deformation.
This study proposes a data-driven statistical reduced-order modeling framework
to provide a probabilistic forecast of the deformation process leading to
porosity-based ductile damage, with uncertainty quantification. The framework
starts with computing the time evolution of the leading moments of specific
state variables from full-field polycrystal simulations. Then a sparse model
identification algorithm based on causation entropy, including essential
physical constraints, is used to discover the governing equations of these
moments. An approximate solution of the time evolution of the PDF is obtained
from the predicted moments exploiting the maximum entropy principle. Numerical
experiments based on polycrystal realizations show that the model can
characterize the time evolution of the non-Gaussian PDF of the von Mises stress
and quantify the probability of extreme events. The learning process also
reveals that the mean stress interacts with higher-order moments and extreme
events in a strongly nonlinear and multiplicative fashion. In addition, the
calibrated moment equations provide a reasonably accurate forecast when applied
to the realizations outside the training data set, indicating the robustness of
the model and the skill for extrapolation. Finally, an information-based
measurement shows that the leading four moments are sufficient to characterize
the crucial non-Gaussian features throughout the entire deformation history.

a module-wise quantization strategy that, in contrast to uniform and
mixed-precision quantization, accounts for the modular structure of typical 6D
pose estimation frameworks. We demonstrate that uniquely compressing these
modules outperforms uniform and mixed-precision quantization techniques.
Moreover, our experiments evidence that module-wise quantization can lead to a
significant accuracy boost. We showcase the generality of our approach using
different datasets, quantization methodologies, and network architectures,
including the recent ZebraPose.

  in Cryptocurrencies",,,,,"cs.CR quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Current solutions to quantum vulnerabilities of widely used cryptographic
schemes involve migrating users to post-quantum schemes before quantum attacks
become feasible. This work deals with protecting quantum procrastinators: users
that failed to migrate to post-quantum cryptography in time.
  To address this problem in the context of digital signatures, we introduce a
technique called signature lifting, that allows us to lift a deployed
pre-quantum signature scheme satisfying a certain property to a post-quantum
signature scheme that uses the same keys. Informally, the said property is that
a post-quantum one-way function is used ""somewhere along the way"" to derive the
public-key from the secret-key. Our constructions of signature lifting relies
heavily on the post-quantum digital signature scheme Picnic (Chase et al.,
CCS'17).
  Our main case-study is cryptocurrencies, where this property holds in two
scenarios: when the public-key is generated via a key-derivation function or
when the public-key hash is posted instead of the public-key itself. We propose
a modification, based on signature lifting, that can be applied in many
cryptocurrencies for securely spending pre-quantum coins in presence of quantum
adversaries. Our construction improves upon existing constructions in two major
ways: it is not limited to pre-quantum coins whose ECDSA public-key has been
kept secret (and in particular, it handles all coins that are stored in
addresses generated by HD wallets), and it does not require access to
post-quantum coins or using side payments to pay for posting the transaction.

phenomena with direct impact on human health and disease. One conventional
approach to study cell migration involves the quantitative analysis of
individual cell trajectories recorded by time-lapse video microscopy. Dedicated
software tools exist to assist the automated or semi-automated tracking of
cells and translate these into coordinate positions along time. However, cell
biologists usually bump into the difficulty of plotting and computing these
data sets into biologically meaningful figures and metrics. Methods: This
report describes MigraR, an intuitive graphical user interface executed from
the RStudioTM (via the R package Shiny), which greatly simplifies the task of
translating coordinate positions of moving cells into measurable parameters of
cell migration (velocity, straightness, and direction of movement), as well as
of plotting cell trajectories and migration metrics. One innovative function of
this interface is that it allows users to refine their data sets by setting
limits based on time, velocity and straightness. Results: MigraR was tested on
different data to assess its applicability. Intended users of MigraR are cell
biologists with no prior knowledge of data analysis, seeking to accelerate the
quantification and visualization of cell migration data sets delivered in the
format of Excel files by available cell-tracking software. Conclusions: Through
the graphics it provides, MigraR is an useful tool for the analysis of
migration parameters and cellular trajectories. Since its source code is open,
it can be subject of refinement by expert users to best suit the needs of other
researchers. It is available at GitHub and can be easily reproduced.

matrix of the finite element method (FEM), when an iterative scheme is applied
to the coefficient matrix of our wavelet Galerkin method, much fewer iterations
are needed for the relative residuals to be within a tolerance level.
Furthermore, for a fixed wavenumber, the number of required iterations is
practically independent of the size of the wavelet coefficient matrix, due to
the uniformly bounded small condition numbers of such wavelets. In contrast,
when an iterative scheme is applied to the FEM coefficient matrix, the number
of required iterations doubles as the mesh size for each axis is halved. The
implementation can also be done conveniently thanks to the simple structure,

programming with multiple distinct qualities. One long-acknowledged quality is
liveness: providing programmers with in-depth feedback about a program's
dynamic behavior as the program is edited. A second quality, long-explored but
lacking a shared term of art, is richness: allowing programmers to edit
programs though domain-specific representations and interactions rather than
solely through text. In this paper, we map the relationship between these two
qualities and survey past work that exemplifies them. We observe that systems
combining liveness and richness often do so at the cost of an essential quality
of traditional programming: composability. We argue that, by combining
liveness, richness, and composability, programming systems can better capture
the full potential of interactive computation without leaving behind the
expressivity of traditional code.

interfaces that can lead end-users toward (unknowingly) taking actions that
they may not have intended. Such deceptive UI designs can result in adverse
effects on end users, such as oversharing personal information or financial
loss. While significant research progress has been made toward the development
of dark pattern taxonomies, developers and users currently lack guidance to
help recognize, avoid, and navigate these often subtle design motifs. However,
automated recognition of dark patterns is a challenging task, as the
instantiation of a single type of pattern can take many forms, leading to
significant variability.
  In this paper, we take the first step toward understanding the extent to
which common UI dark patterns can be automatically recognized in modern
software applications. To do this, we introduce AidUI, a novel automated
approach that uses computer vision and natural language processing techniques
to recognize a set of visual and textual cues in application screenshots that

detection, classification, and localization. To evaluate our approach, we have
constructed ContextDP, the current largest dataset of fully-localized UI dark

achieves an overall precision of 0.66, recall of 0.67, F1-score of 0.65 in
detecting dark pattern instances, reports few false positives, and is able to
localize detected patterns with an IoU score of ~0.84. Furthermore, a

  Localization in Medical Imaging",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Federated learning is a recent development in the machine learning area that
allows a system of devices to train on one or more tasks without sharing their

centralized global model to consolidate individual models into one, and the
devices train synchronously, which both can be potential bottlenecks for using
federated learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method of asynchronous
decentralized federated lifelong learning (ADFLL) method that inherits the
merits of federated learning and can train on multiple tasks simultaneously
without the need for a central node or synchronous training. Thus, overcoming
the potential drawbacks of conventional federated learning. We demonstrate
excellent performance on the brain tumor segmentation (BRATS) dataset for
localizing the left ventricle on multiple image sequences and image
orientation. Our framework allows agents to achieve the best performance with a
mean distance error of 7.81, better than the conventional all-knowing agent's
mean distance error of 11.78, and significantly (p=0.01) better than a
conventional lifelong learning agent with a distance error of 15.17 after eight
rounds of training. In addition, all ADFLL agents have comparable or better
performance than a conventional LL agent. In conclusion, we developed an ADFLL

solder materials that are of low thermal conductivity. Understanding how
thermal conductivity is affected by the presence of these materials is required
for developing thermally aware IC design. The 3{\omega} method can measure
thermal conductivities spanning several orders of magnitude and is appropriate
for measuring the thermal properties of layered structures such as 3D ICs. In
this work, we use the 3{\omega} method with planar and cylindrical heat flow
geometries to determine thermal conductivities of the memory layers and layers
with polymer and solder bumps in High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) Random Access

layers in HBM as 140 W/m-K, while the through-plane conductivity of the
polymer/solder bump layer is 2 W/m-K. Combining the results of x-ray tomography

Improvement in the thermal performance of 3D ICs will require improvement in

Noether charges associated with a given codimension-2 surface become integrable

of extended phase space to all gauge theories with arbitrary combinations of
internal and spacetime local symmetries. We formulate this in terms of a
corresponding Atiyah Lie algebroid, a geometric object derived from a principal
bundle which features internal symmetries and diffeomorphisms on an equal
footing. In this language, gauge transformations are understood as morphisms
between Atiyah Lie algebroids that preserve the geometric structures encoded
therein. The extended configuration space of a gauge theory can subsequently be
understood as the space of pairs $(\varphi, \Phi)$, where $\varphi$ is a Lie
algebroid morphism and $\Phi$ is a field configuration in the non-extended
sense. Starting from this data, we outline a very powerful, manifestly
geometric approach to the extended phase space. Using this approach, we find
that the action of the group of gauge transformations and diffeomorphisms on
the symplectic geometry of any covariant theory is integrable. We motivate our
construction by carefully examining the need for extended phase space in
Chern-Simons gauge theories and display its usefulness by re-computing the
charge algebra. We also describe the implementation of the configuration
algebroid in Einstein-Yang-Mills theories.

cell viability in biology. Researchers often use ATP bioluminescence to measure
the ATP of organoid after drug to evaluate the drug efficacy. However, ATP
bioluminescence has some limitations, leading to unreliable drug screening
results. Performing ATP bioluminescence causes cell lysis of organoids, so it
is impossible to observe organoids' long-term viability changes after
medication continually. To overcome the disadvantages of ATP bioluminescence,
we propose Ins-ATP, a non-invasive strategy, the first organoid ATP estimation
model based on the high-throughput microscopic image. Ins-ATP directly
estimates the ATP of organoids from high-throughput microscopic images, so that
it does not influence the drug reactions of organoids. Therefore, the ATP
change of organoids can be observed for a long time to obtain more stable
results. Experimental results show that the ATP estimation by Ins-ATP is in
good agreement with those determined by ATP bioluminescence. Specifically, the
predictions of Ins-ATP are consistent with the results measured by ATP
bioluminescence in the efficacy evaluation experiments of different drugs.

biorthogonal Block Wavelet Transform (BWT). Convolutional filtering operations
are performed in the transform domain using element-wise multiplications by
taking advantage of the convolution theorems. Trainable soft-thresholding
layers that remove noise in the transform domain bring nonlinearity to the
transform domain layers. Compared to the Conv2D layer which is spatial-agnostic
and channel-specific, the proposed layers are location-specific and
channel-specific. The proposed layers reduce the number of parameters and
multiplications significantly while improving the accuracy results of regular
ResNets on the ImageNet-1K classification task. Furthermore, the proposed
layers can be inserted with a batch normalization layer before the global
average pooling layer in the conventional ResNets as an additional layer to
improve classification accuracy with a negligible increase in the number of
parameters and computational cost.

attention to the retinal vascular, while the 2D OCTA image translation model
introduces beneficial heuristic contextual information. Extensive experimental
results on two challenging datasets demonstrate that TransPro can consistently

machine learning to solve software problems. Recent studies have shown
surprising results of source code learning, which applies deep neural networks
(DNNs) to various critical software tasks, e.g., bug detection and clone
detection. This success can be greatly attributed to the utilization of massive
high-quality training data, and in practice, data augmentation, which is a
technique used to produce additional training data, has been widely adopted in
various domains, such as computer vision. However, in source code learning,
data augmentation has not been extensively studied, and existing practice is
limited to simple syntax-preserved methods, such as code refactoring.
Essentially, source code is often represented in two ways, namely, sequentially
as text data and structurally as graph data, when it is used as training data
in source code learning. Inspired by these analogy relations, we take an early
step to investigate whether data augmentation methods that are originally used
for text and graphs are effective in improving the training quality of source

effect on the free energy of chains and the reduction of the effective radius
due to the ""dead zone"" slow down the imbibition. Reduction of the entanglements
is the main factor behind the reversing dynamics because of the lower effective
viscosity, which leads to a faster filling. This effect is enhanced in the
smaller capillary and more profound for longer chains. The observed increase in
the mean square radius of gyration during capillary filling provides a clear
evidence of chain orientation, which leads to the decrease in the number of

three-point correlation functions endowed with the remarkable simplifying
property that it does not mix under permutations of the external quasi-primary

cross-ratios without the need to project back to position space, thus
effectively deriving all conformal bootstrap equations directly from the

data for training. However, the increasing number of new categories and class
imbalance make exhaustive annotation impractical. Few-shot object detection
(FSOD) addresses this issue by leveraging meta-learning on seen base classes
and fine-tuning on novel classes with limited labeled samples. Nonetheless, the
substantial scale and orientation variations of objects in remote sensing
images pose significant challenges to existing few-shot object detection
methods. To overcome these challenges, we propose integrating a feature pyramid
network and utilizing prototype features to enhance query features, thereby
improving existing FSOD methods. We refer to this modified FSOD approach as a
Strong Baseline, which has demonstrated significant performance improvements
compared to the original baselines. Furthermore, we tackle the issue of spatial
misalignment caused by orientation variations between the query and support
images by introducing a Transformation-Invariant Network (TINet). TINet ensures
geometric invariance and explicitly aligns the features of the query and
support branches, resulting in additional performance gains while maintaining
the same inference speed as the Strong Baseline. Extensive experiments on three
widely used remote sensing object detection datasets, i.e., NWPU VHR-10.v2,
DIOR, and HRRSD demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

attacks, where attackers embed hidden backdoors in the DNN model by injecting a
few poisoned examples into the training dataset. While extensive efforts have
been made to detect and remove backdoors from backdoored DNNs, it is still not
clear whether a backdoor-free clean model can be directly obtained from
poisoned datasets. In this paper, we first construct a causal graph to model
the generation process of poisoned data and find that the backdoor attack acts
as the confounder, which brings spurious associations between the input images
and target labels, making the model predictions less reliable. Inspired by the
causal understanding, we propose the Causality-inspired Backdoor Defense (CBD),
to learn deconfounded representations for reliable classification.
Specifically, a backdoored model is intentionally trained to capture the
confounding effects. The other clean model dedicates to capturing the desired
causal effects by minimizing the mutual information with the confounding
representations from the backdoored model and employing a sample-wise
re-weighting scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
against 6 state-of-the-art attacks verify that our proposed defense method is
effective in reducing backdoor threats while maintaining high accuracy in
predicting benign samples. Further analysis shows that CBD can also resist
potential adaptive attacks. The code is available at

with prominent advantages. Existing methods usually design skeleton descriptors
with raw body joints or perform skeleton sequence representation learning.
However, they typically cannot concurrently model different body-component
relations, and rarely explore useful semantics from fine-grained
representations of body joints. In this paper, we propose a generic
Transformer-based Skeleton Graph prototype contrastive learning (TranSG)
approach with structure-trajectory prompted reconstruction to fully capture
skeletal relations and valuable spatial-temporal semantics from skeleton graphs
for person re-ID. Specifically, we first devise the Skeleton Graph Transformer
(SGT) to simultaneously learn body and motion relations within skeleton graphs,
so as to aggregate key correlative node features into graph representations.
Then, we propose the Graph Prototype Contrastive learning (GPC) to mine the
most typical graph features (graph prototypes) of each identity, and contrast
the inherent similarity between graph representations and different prototypes
from both skeleton and sequence levels to learn discriminative graph
representations. Last, a graph Structure-Trajectory Prompted Reconstruction
(STPR) mechanism is proposed to exploit the spatial and temporal contexts of
graph nodes to prompt skeleton graph reconstruction, which facilitates
capturing more valuable patterns and graph semantics for person re-ID.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TranSG significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods. We further show its generality under
different graph modeling, RGB-estimated skeletons, and unsupervised scenarios.

combined with the TSCM+2D hybrid convolution proposed in our previous study to
form a new lightweight end-to-end CSLR network-Low resolution input

training, and then uses low-resolution frames as input to the student network
LRINet to perform knowledge distillation on frame-level features and

Designing an FTRL-type algorithm for linear bandits is an important question

subjected to a parametric process for a finite time interval such that the mode
frequency of the field transits from one constant value to another. This
configuration mimics a statically-bounded universe, but not a continuously
evolving one. The field squeezed by this process should contain information of
the process itself. If an atom is coupled to the field after the parametric
process, its response will depend on the squeezing, and any quantum radiation
emitted by the atom will carry this information away so that an observer at a
much later time may still identify it. Our analyses show that 1) a remote
observer cannot measure the generated squeezing via the radiation energy flux
from the atom because the net radiation energy flux is canceled. However, 2)
there is a chance to identify squeezing by measuring the constant radiation
energy density at late times. The only restriction is that this energy density
is of the near-field nature. The second part of this paper focuses on 3) the
dependence of squeezing on the functional form of the parametric process. Via
several examples we demonstrate that the behavior of squeezing reflect
essential properties of the parametric process. In fact, striking features may
show up in complicated processes involving various scales. These analyses allow
us to establish the connection between properties of a squeezed quantum field
and the parametric process which does the squeezing. Therefore, 4) one can
construct templates to reconstitute the unknown parametric processes from the
data of measurable quantities subjected to squeezing. In a sequel paper these
results will be applied to a study of quantum radiations in cosmology.

  Stochastic Oracles",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Several classical adaptive optimization algorithms, such as line search and
trust region methods, have been recently extended to stochastic settings where
function values, gradients, and Hessians in some cases, are estimated via
stochastic oracles. Unlike the majority of stochastic methods, these methods do
not use a pre-specified sequence of step size parameters, but adapt the step
size parameter according to the estimated progress of the algorithm and use it
to dictate the accuracy required from the stochastic approximations. The
requirements on stochastic approximations are, thus, also adaptive and the
oracle costs can vary from iteration to iteration. The step size parameters in
these methods can increase and decrease based on the perceived progress, but
unlike the deterministic case they are not bounded away from zero due to
possible oracle failures, and bounds on the step size parameter have not been
previously derived. This creates obstacles in the total complexity analysis of
such methods, because the oracle costs are typically decreasing in the step
size parameter, and could be arbitrarily large as the step size parameter goes
to 0. Thus, until now only the total iteration complexity of these methods has
been analyzed. In this paper, we derive a lower bound on the step size
parameter that holds with high probability for a large class of adaptive
stochastic methods. We then use this lower bound to derive a framework for
analyzing the expected and high probability total oracle complexity of any
method in this class. Finally, we apply this framework to analyze the total
sample complexity of two particular algorithms, STORM and SASS, in the expected
risk minimization problem.

classification and evaluation of pain severity are necessary. However, this can
be challenging as pain is a subjective sensation-driven experience. Traditional
techniques for measuring pain intensity, e.g. self-report scales, are
susceptible to bias and unreliable in some instances. Consequently, there is a
need for more objective and automatic pain intensity assessment strategies. In
this paper, we develop PainAttnNet (PAN), a novel transfomer-encoder
deep-learning framework for classifying pain intensities with physiological
signals as input. The proposed approach is comprised of three feature
extraction architectures: multiscale convolutional networks (MSCN), a
squeeze-and-excitation residual network (SEResNet), and a transformer encoder
block. On the basis of pain stimuli, MSCN extracts short- and long-window
information as well as sequential features. SEResNet highlights relevant
extracted features by mapping the interdependencies among features. The third
module employs a transformer encoder consisting of three temporal convolutional
networks (TCN) with three multi-head attention (MHA) layers to extract temporal
dependencies from the features. Using the publicly available BioVid pain

outcomes outperform state-of-the-art models. These results confirm that our
approach can be utilized for automated classification of pain intensity using

here that RC delivers an improvement in performance of the concatenated Steane

increasing the size of the codes. These results suggest that using randomized

otherwise can share an unlimited amount of classical correlation.
Interestingly, the same classical channel can ensure a positive payoff when

among all the 2-input-2-output no-signaling correlations, only Hardy's
correlation can ensure a positive payoff when assisted to 1-cbit channel. This
further prompts us to show that in the correlation assisted reverse zero-error

to make only a few annotations of novel WM tracts for training the segmentation

  A Causality Perspective","Accepted by CVPR2023",,,,"cs.CV cs.MM eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, we have witnessed the great advancement of Deep neural
networks (DNNs) in image restoration. However, a critical limitation is that
they cannot generalize well to real-world degradations with different degrees
or types. In this paper, we are the first to propose a novel training strategy
for image restoration from the causality perspective, to improve the
generalization ability of DNNs for unknown degradations. Our method, termed
Distortion Invariant representation Learning (DIL), treats each distortion type
and degree as one specific confounder, and learns the distortion-invariant
representation by eliminating the harmful confounding effect of each
degradation. We derive our DIL with the back-door criterion in causality by
modeling the interventions of different distortions from the optimization
perspective. Particularly, we introduce counterfactual distortion augmentation
to simulate the virtual distortion types and degrees as the confounders. Then,
we instantiate the intervention of each distortion with a virtual model
updating based on corresponding distorted images, and eliminate them from the
meta-learning perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our DIL on the generalization capability for unseen distortion types and
degrees. Our code will be available at

images are caused by different reasons like the camera shake and the object
motion. The single image deblurring method is a possible way to solve this
problem. However, since it deals with each view independently and cannot
effectively utilize and maintain the LF structure, the restoration effect is
usually not ideal. Besides, the LF blur is more complex because the degree is
affected by the views and depth. Therefore, we carefully designed a novel LF
deblurring network based on the LF blur characteristics. On one hand, since the
blur degree varies a lot in different views, we design a novel view adaptive
spatial convolution to deblur blurred LFs, which calculates the exclusive
convolution kernel for each view. On the other hand, because the blur degree
also varies with the depth of the object, a depth perception view attention is
designed to deblur different depth areas by selectively integrating information
from different views. Besides, we introduce an angular position embedding to
maintain the LF structure better, which ensures the model correctly restores
the view information. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on
synthetic and real images show that the deblurring effect of our method is
better than other state-of-the-art methods.

generation of Only-Train-Once (OTOv2), which first automatically trains and
compresses a general DNN only once from scratch to produce a more compact model

pluggable into various deep learning applications, and requires almost minimal
engineering efforts from the users. Methodologically, OTOv2 proposes two major
improvements: (i) Autonomy: automatically exploits the dependency of general
DNNs, partitions the trainable variables into Zero-Invariant Groups (ZIGs), and
constructs the compressed model; and (ii) Dual Half-Space Projected Gradient
(DHSPG): a novel optimizer to more reliably solve structured-sparsity problems.
Numerically, we demonstrate the generality and autonomy of OTOv2 on a variety
of model architectures such as VGG, ResNet, CARN, ConvNeXt, DenseNet and
StackedUnets, the majority of which cannot be handled by other methods without
extensive handcrafting efforts. Together with benchmark datasets including

The most recently proposed approach to PSI in the database community was Prism,

semantic security: the encoding on the servers is deterministic, implying that
the scheme cannot be indistinguishable under a chosen-plaintext attack

orthogonal primitives, namely Kaleido-RND and Kaleido-AES: the former exhibits
highly efficient performance with randomized encoding and the latter is
provably secure under CPA attacks with more computational overhead. A system

Extensive experiments on the TPC-H benchmark and three real-world applications

different such methods can produce several plausible but different
interpretations of a given model, leading to confusion about which one to
choose. {In this work, an {inherently} interpretable encoder-decoder model
coupled with a single-layer fully connected network with unity weights is
proposed for binary medical image classification problems. The feature
extraction component of a trained black-box network for the same task is
employed as the pre-trained encoder of the interpretable model. The model is
trained to estimate the decision statistic of the given trained black-box deep
binary classifier to maintain a similar accuracy.} The decoder output
represents a transformed version of the to-be-classified image that, when
processed by the fixed fully connected layer, produces the same decision
statistic value as the original classifier. This is accomplished by minimizing
the mean squared error between the decision statistic values of the black-box
model and encoder-decoder based model during training. The decoder output image
is referred to as an equivalency map. Because the single-layer network is fully
interpretable, the equivalency map provides a visualization of the transformed

happen in the real world. This gap between the assumed and actual degradation
hurts the restoration performance where artifacts are often observed in the
output. However, it is expensive and infeasible to include every type of
degradation to cover real-world cases in the training data. To tackle this
robustness issue, we propose Diffusion-based Robust Degradation Remover (DR2)
to first transform the degraded image to a coarse but degradation-invariant
prediction, then employ an enhancement module to restore the coarse prediction
to a high-quality image. By leveraging a well-performing denoising diffusion
probabilistic model, our DR2 diffuses input images to a noisy status where
various types of degradation give way to Gaussian noise, and then captures
semantic information through iterative denoising steps. As a result, DR2 is
robust against common degradation (e.g. blur, resize, noise and compression)

developments in theory and applications of charge transfer plasmon resonances

In particular, we give a due attention to exploiting ultratunable spectral
features of charge transfer plasmon resonances for developing multifunctional
plasmonic sensors for bulk, surface, gas and molecular sensing applications. We
have also briefly discussed that the charge and energy transfer between two
plasmonic nanoparticles linked by sub-nanometer length self-assembled
monolayers are of interest for single-molecule detection and molecular
electronics. In addition to the well-established surface plasmon resonance and
localized surface plasmon resonance based sensing schemes, CTPR sensors may
open up a new route in efforts to develop multifunctional sensing technologies.

visual experiences. As their popularity has increased dramatically in recent
years, evaluating the quality of 360 images has become a problem of interest
since it provides insights for capturing, transmitting, and consuming this new
media. However, directly adapting quality assessment methods proposed for
standard natural images for omnidirectional data poses certain challenges.
These models need to deal with very high-resolution data and implicit
distortions due to the spherical form of the images. In this study, we present
a method for no-reference 360 image quality assessment. Our proposed ST360IQ
model extracts tangent viewports from the salient parts of the input
omnidirectional image and employs a vision-transformers based module processing
saliency selective patches/tokens that estimates a quality score from each

CrossFormer. It introduces a cross-scale embedding layer (CEL) and a long-short
distance attention (LSDA). On the one hand, CEL blends each token with multiple
patches of different scales, providing the self-attention module itself with
cross-scale features. On the other hand, LSDA splits the self-attention module
into a short-distance one and a long-distance counterpart, which not only
reduces the computational burden but also keeps both small-scale and
large-scale features in the tokens. Moreover, through experiments on
CrossFormer, we observe another two issues that affect vision transformers'
performance, i.e. the enlarging self-attention maps and amplitude explosion.
Thus, we further propose a progressive group size (PGS) paradigm and an
amplitude cooling layer (ACL) to alleviate the two issues, respectively. The
CrossFormer incorporating with PGS and ACL is called CrossFormer++. Extensive
experiments show that CrossFormer++ outperforms the other vision transformers

new learning paradigm that targets unified transferring from a single
foundation model to a variety of downstream tasks. ViM consists of a zoo of
lightweight plug-in modules, each of which is independently learned on a
midstream dataset with a shared frozen backbone. Downstream tasks can then
benefit from an adequate aggregation of the module zoo thanks to the rich
knowledge inherited from midstream tasks. There are three major advantages of
such a design. From the efficiency aspect, the upstream backbone can be trained
only once and reused for all downstream tasks without tuning. From the
scalability aspect, we can easily append additional modules to ViM with no
influence on existing modules. From the performance aspect, ViM can include as
many midstream tasks as possible, narrowing the task gap between upstream and
downstream. Considering these benefits, we believe that ViM, which the
community could maintain and develop together, would serve as a powerful tool
to assist foundation models.

  The system ground-state can be either in the superfluid phase or in the Mott

delocalised over the whole lattice and overlap. In the Mott phase, the wave
functions are localised around lattice sites. The GHZ state is being generated
in the superfluid phase and stored in the Mott insulator phase. It is achieved
by a linear change of the potential depth in an optical lattice filled with

if the prior model admits multiple levels of hierarchy, and traditional
numerical optimization routines or expectation--maximization algorithms are
difficult to implement. To this end, our contribution is a novel local linear
approximation scheme that circumvents this issue using a very simple

resistivity ratio decreases with Nb doping, suggesting an increase of disorder.
For all compounds, the optical conductivity in the pristine phase reveals two

signifying an enhancement of electronic correlations. Below $T_{\text{CDW}}$,
while the optical conductivity clearly manifests the CDW gap in all materials,
the gapped portion of the Fermi surface shrinks as the Nb content grows. A
comprehensive analysis indicates that the change of the Fermi surface, the
enhancement of electronic correlations, the shrinkage of the removed Fermi
surface by the CDW gap, and the increase of disorder may all have a
considerable impact on the interplay between the CDW and superconductivity in

propose a method to determine unambiguously the refractive index, extinction
coefficient and thickness of a film when a transparent range is available in
the energy range investigated. We decompose the analysis in three steps. First,
the thickness of the film is determined from the transparent range of the film.
Then, knowing the thickness of the layer, an initial estimation of the
refractive index and extinction coefficient is made based on a first-order
Taylor expansion of the ellipsometric ratio. Finally, using this estimation, a
numerical regression is done to ensure the convergence of the fit towards the
solution. A theoretical example of the method is given for two different

semantic segmentation where their predictions are constrained to a predefined
set of semantic classes. They are to be deployed in applications such as
automated driving, although their categorically confined expressive power runs
contrary to such open world scenarios. Thus, the detection and segmentation of
objects from outside their predefined semantic space, i.e., out-of-distribution
(OoD) objects, is of highest interest. Since uncertainty estimation methods
like softmax entropy or Bayesian models are sensitive to erroneous predictions,
these methods are a natural baseline for OoD detection. Here, we present a
method for obtaining uncertainty scores from pixel-wise loss gradients which
can be computed efficiently during inference. Our approach is simple to
implement for a large class of models, does not require any additional training
or auxiliary data and can be readily used on pre-trained segmentation models.
Our experiments show the ability of our method to identify wrong pixel
classifications and to estimate prediction quality. In particular, we observe
superior performance in terms of OoD segmentation to comparable baselines on
the SegmentMeIfYouCan benchmark, clearly outperforming methods which are
similarly flexible to implement.

adaptive moving mesh finite difference schemes for the shallow water equations
(SWEs) with non-flat bottom topography. To enable the construction of the ES
schemes on moving meshes, a reformulation of the SWEs is introduced, with the
bottom topography as an additional conservative variable that evolves in time.
The corresponding energy inequality is derived based on a modified energy
function, then the reformulated SWEs and energy inequality are transformed into
curvilinear coordinates. A two-point energy conservative (EC) flux is
constructed, and high-order EC schemes based on such a flux are proved to be WB
that they preserve the lake at rest. Then high-order ES schemes are derived by
adding suitable dissipation terms to the EC schemes, which are newly designed
to maintain the WB and ES properties simultaneously. The adaptive moving mesh
strategy is performed by iteratively solving the Euler-Lagrangian equations of
a mesh adaptation functional. The fully-discrete schemes are obtained by using
the explicit strong-stability preserving third-order Runge-Kutta method.
Several numerical tests are conducted to validate the accuracy, WB and ES
properties, shock-capturing ability, and high efficiency of the schemes.

ignoring low-resolution (LR) circumstances. The LR circumstances weaken the
counting performance deeply for two crucial reasons: 1) limited detail
information; 2) overlapping head regions accumulate in density maps and result
in extreme ground-truth values. An intuitive solution is to employ
super-resolution (SR) pre-processes for the input LR images. However, it
complicates the inference steps and thus limits application potentials when
requiring real-time. We propose a more elegant method termed Multi-Scale
Super-Resolution Module (MSSRM). It guides the network to estimate the lost de
tails and enhances the detailed information in the feature space. Noteworthy
that the MSSRM is plug-in plug-out and deals with the LR problems with no

link label-free latent variables in GMM with label-noisy annotations. Then, TCL
detects the examples with wrong labels as the out-of-distribution examples by

bootstraps the true targets from model predictions to handle the noisy labels.
As a result, TCL can learn discriminative representations aligned with

prohibitive time complexity. While analytical and hybrid fault
injection-/analytical-based methods have been proposed, they are either

we propose a novel accurate, fine-grain, metric-oriented, and

ranges for DNN neurons' outputs. An outcome of DeepVigor is an analytical model
representing vulnerable and non-vulnerable ranges for each neuron that can be
exploited to develop different techniques for improving DNNs' reliability.
Moreover, DeepVigor provides reliability assessment metrics based on
vulnerability factors for bits, neurons, and layers using the vulnerability
ranges. The proposed method is not only faster than fault injection but also
provides extensive and accurate information about the reliability of DNNs,
independent from the accelerator. The experimental evaluations in the paper
indicate that the proposed vulnerability ranges are 99.9% to 100% accurate even
when evaluated on previously unseen test data. Also, it is shown that the
obtained vulnerability factors represent the criticality of bits, neurons, and
layers proficiently. DeepVigor is implemented in the PyTorch framework and
validated on complex DNN benchmarks.

gas of $N$ particles is analyzed by considering the phase space of the system

{thermodynamics} to define the corresponding probability distribution function.
While the construction of the phase space respects the separability of the
system, by forcing each particle to satisfy the so-called mass-shell
constraint, the probability distribution is constructed by mixing the natural
symplectic structure of the cotangent bundle with a Hamiltonian description of
the system. In this way, the spacetime is introduced into the statistics and
its isometries turn out to be of special interest because the distributions are
parameterized by the elements of the Lie algebra of the isometry group, through
the momentum map of the action of the isometries in $T^{*}M^{N}$. We find the
Gibbs distribution that, in the simplest case of a flat spacetime, reduces to
the so-called modified J\""{u}ttner distribution, used to describe ideal gases
in the regime of special relativity. We also define a temperature-like function
using the norm of a Killing vector, which allows us to recover the so-called
Tolman-Ehrenfest effect. As a particular example, we study the outer region of
a Schwarzschild black hole, for which a power series expansion of the
Schwarzschild radius allows us to represent the partition function and the
Gibbs distribution in terms of the corresponding quantities of the Minkowski

JVLA 5GHz data in the ELAIS-N1 field, we study the radio spectral properties of
radio-detected star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at observer-frame frequencies of
150-5000MHz. We select ~3,500 SFGs that have both LOFAR 150MHz and GMRT 610MHz
detections by removing AGN from the two radio samples, and obtain a median
spectral index of $\alpha_{150}^{610}=-0.51\pm0.01$ with a scatter of
$\sigma=0.2$. Due to the relatively lower sensitivity of uGMRT 400MHz data, we
apply a flux cut of $S_{610}>300\mu$Jy and obtain the median spectral indices
of $\alpha_{150}^{385}=-0.42^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$,
$\alpha_{385}^{610}=-0.44^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$, and
$\alpha_{150}^{610}=-0.42^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$ for the sample of 258 SFGs that have
detections at these three radio frequencies. The JVLA 5GHz observations only
cover the central 0.1deg$^{2}$, where ~100 SFGs are selected, for which we
obtain median $\alpha_{610}^{5000}=-1.14^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$,
$\alpha_{385}^{5000}=-1.08^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$ and
$\alpha_{150}^{5000}=-0.87\pm0.01$. Overall, the results show that the radio
spectrum is flatter if we include a lower frequency dataset when measuring the
radio spectral index at 150-5000MHz. We study the correlations between radio
spectral index and physical properties of radio-selected SFGs and find that, on
average, the radio spectrum slightly steepens with increasing stellar mass.
However, we only find that the radio spectrum flattens with increasing optical
depth at V-band at $\nu<\sim1$GHz. We suggest that spectral ageing due to the
energy loss of cosmic ray electrons and thermal free-free absorption could be
among the most likely physical mechanisms that drive the two correlations
respectively. Both of these could be the physical causes of why the radio
spectrum is flatter at low frequency than at high frequency.

allows annotators to iteratively refine labels with corrective interactions,
such as clicks. While existing interactive models transform clicks into user
guidance signals, which are combined with images to form (image, guidance)
pairs, the question of how to best represent the guidance has not been fully
explored. To address this, we conduct a comparative study of existing guidance
signals by training interactive models with different signals and parameter
settings to identify crucial parameters for the model's design. Based on our
findings, we design a guidance signal that retains the benefits of other
signals while addressing their limitations. We propose an adaptive Gaussian
heatmaps guidance signal that utilizes the geodesic distance transform to
dynamically adapt the radius of each heatmap when encoding clicks. We conduct
our study on the MSD Spleen and the AutoPET datasets to explore the

results show that choosing the guidance signal is crucial for interactive

clinical workflows. We will make our code publically available.

$\{A,B\}$ to two bidiagonal forms simultaneously, which can be used for
computing a partial generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) of

inner iteration usually can not be computed exactly. In this paper, we study
the inaccurately computed inner iterations of JBD by first investigating
influence of computational error of the inner iteration on the outer iteration,
and then proposing a reorthogonalized JBD (rJBD) process to keep orthogonality
of a part of Lanczos vectors. An error analysis of the rJBD is carried out to
build up connections with Lanczos bidiabonalizations. The results are then used

is shown that the accuracy of computed GSVD components depend on the computing
accuracy of inner iterations and condition number of $(A^T,B^T)^T$ while the
convergence rate is not affected very much. For practical JBD based GSVD

prediction of the protein-protein interaction sites (PPIs) deepens our
understanding of biological mechanism and is crucial for new drug design.
However, conventional experimental methods for PPIs prediction are costly and
time-consuming so that many computational approaches, especially ML-based
methods, have been developed recently. Although these approaches have achieved
gratifying results, there are still two limitations: (1) Most models have
excavated some useful input features, but failed to take coevolutionary
features into account, which could provide clues for inter-residue
relationships; (2) The attention-based models only allocate attention weights
for neighboring residues, instead of doing it globally, neglecting that some
residues being far away from the target residues might also matter.
  We propose a coevolution-enhanced global attention neural network, a
sequence-based deep learning model for PPIs prediction, called CoGANPPIS. It
utilizes three layers in parallel for feature extraction: (1) Local-level
representation aggregation layer, which aggregates the neighboring residues'
features; (2) Global-level representation learning layer, which employs a novel
coevolution-enhanced global attention mechanism to allocate attention weights
to all the residues on the same protein sequences; (3) Coevolutionary
information learning layer, which applies CNN & pooling to coevolutionary
information to obtain the coevolutionary profile representation. Then, the
three outputs are concatenated and passed into several fully connected layers
for the final prediction. Application on two benchmark datasets demonstrated a

make the decision-making less reliable. Confidence calibration has been
recently proposed as one effective solution to this problem. Nevertheless, the
majority of existing confidence calibration methods aims at non-sequential
data, which is limited if directly applied to sequential data since the
intrinsic contextual dependency in sequences or the class-specific statistical
prior is seldom exploited. To the end, we propose a Context-Aware Selective
Label Smoothing (CASLS) method for calibrating sequential data. The proposed
CASLS fully leverages the contextual dependency in sequences to construct
confusion matrices of contextual prediction statistics over different classes.
Class-specific error rates are then used to adjust the weights of smoothing
strength in order to achieve adaptive calibration. Experimental results on
sequence recognition tasks, including scene text recognition and speech
recognition, demonstrate that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art
performance.

latest end-to-end image-to-text approaches simultaneously predict the two

bounding boxes of the cells) is based on the representation of the logical
structure. However, the previous methods struggle with imprecise bounding boxes
as the logical representation lacks local visual information. To address this
issue, we propose an end-to-end sequential modeling framework for table
structure recognition called VAST. It contains a novel coordinate sequence
decoder triggered by the representation of the non-empty cell from the logical
structure decoder. In the coordinate sequence decoder, we model the bounding
box coordinates as a language sequence, where the left, top, right and bottom
coordinates are decoded sequentially to leverage the inter-coordinate
dependency. Furthermore, we propose an auxiliary visual-alignment loss to
enforce the logical representation of the non-empty cells to contain more local
visual details, which helps produce better cell bounding boxes. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art
results in both logical and physical structure recognition. The ablation study
also validates that the proposed coordinate sequence decoder and the

  New Architecture for Wireless Communications","30 pages, 12 figures. This paper has been submitted to IEEE journal
  for possible publication",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have drawn much attention recently
for their appealing advantages in shaping wireless channels to improve the
spectral and energy efficiencies of wireless communications. However,
conventional fully-passive RISs generally suffer from the so-called
``multiplicative fading'' effect which thereby limits RISs' practicability and
manufacturability. In this paper, a novel architecture of ``Reconfigurable
Distributed Antennas and Reflecting Surfaces (RDARS)'' is first proposed to
overcome this limitation from the ``multiplicative fading'' effect.
Specifically, unlike existing active RIS variants, RDARS inherits the low-cost
and low-energy-consumption benefits of fully-passive RISs by default
configuring all the elements as passive to perform the reflection mode. On the
other hand, based on the design of the additional direct-through state, any
element of the RDARS can be dynamically programmed to connect with the base
station (BS) via fibers and perform the connected mode as remote distributed
antennas of the BS to receive signals. Consequently, a controllable trade-off
between the reflection gain and the distribution gain can be achieved via RDARS
at the BS. To unveil the system behavior of the RDARS-aided system, we analyze
the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) under maximum ratio combining (MRC) at
BS. Closed-form outage probability and ergodic achievable rate are also
provided and are verified through extensive simulations. To demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed RDARS, experiments are carried out using a
prototype of RDARS with a total number of 256 elements which revealed extra 76%
throughput improvement could be achieved by deploying RDARS with only three
elements performing connected mode. This thus confirms the effectiveness of the
proposed RDARS and envisions it as a promising candidate for future 6G wireless
systems.

dynamics of biomolecules in cells. This approach is very flexible and allows us
to model a system of particles in motion, possibly in interaction, that can
each possibly switch from a motion regime (e.g. Brownian) to another (e.g. a
directed motion), along with the appearance over time of new trajectories and
their death after some lifetime, all of these features possibly depending on
the current spatial configuration of all existing particles. We explain how to
specify all characteristics of a BDM model, with many practical examples that
are relevant for bioimaging applications. Based on real fluorescence microscopy
datasets, we finally calibrate our model to mimic the joint dynamics of
Langerin and Rab11 proteins near the plasma membrane. We show that the
resulting synthetic sequences exhibit comparable features as those observed in

ligament reconstruction (ACLR) surgery is a successful return-to-sport. At this
stage, identifying muscular deficits becomes important. Hence, in this study,
three discriminative features based on surface electromyographic signals (sEMG)
acquired in a dynamic protocol are introduced to assess the damping ability and
interpret activation patterns in lower-limb muscles of ACLR athletes. Methods:
The features include the median frequency of the power spectrum density (PSD),
the relative percentage of the equivalent damping or equivalent stiffness
derived from the median frequency, and the energy of the signals in the
time-frequency plane of the pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution (PWVD). To
evaluate the features, 11 healthy and 11 ACLR athletes (6 months
post-reconstruction surgery) were recruited to acquire the sEMG signals from
the medial and the lateral parts of the hamstrings, quadriceps, and
gastrocnemius muscles in pre- and post-fatigue single-leg landings. Results: A
significant damping deficiency is observed in the hamstring muscles of ACLR
athletes by evaluating the proposed features. This deficiency indicates that
more attention should be paid to this muscle of ACLR athletes in
pre-return-to-sport rehabilitations. Conclusion: The quality of
electromyography-based pre-return-to-sport assessments on ACLR subjects depends
on the sEMG acquisition protocol, as well as the type and nature of the
extracted features. Hence, combinatorial application of both energy-based
features (derived from the PWVD) and power-based features (derived from the
PSD) could facilitate the assessment process by providing additional
biomechanical information regarding the behavior of the muscles surrounding the
knee.

we present a model predictive controller that tackles the problem of performing

of OFC generators based on the modulation of microresonator parameters boosted
interest to their further experimental development and theoretical
understanding of underlying phenomena. However, most of theoretical approaches
developed to date were based on the lumped parameter models which unable to
evaluate, analyse, and optimize the effect of spatial distribution of
modulation inside microresonators. Here we develop the multi-quantum
semiclassical theory of parametrically excited OFCs which solves these
problems. As an application, we compare OFCs which are resonantly or
adiabatically excited in a racetrack microresonator (RTM) and a SNAP (Surface
Nanoscale Axial Photonics) bottle microresonator (SBM). The principal
difference between these two types of microresonators consists in much slower
propagation speed of whispering gallery modes along the SBM axis compared to
the speed of modes propagating along the RTM waveguide axis. We show that, due
to this difference, similar OFCs can be generated by an SBM with a much smaller
size compared to that of the RTM. Based on the developed theory, we
analytically express the OFC spectrum of microresonators through the spatial
distribution of modulated parameters and optimize this distribution to arrive
at the strongest OFCs generated with minimum power consumption.

(ISM) remains an unsettled question. Here, this problem is investigated using a
newexact law of compressible isothermal hydrodynamic turbulence, which involves
two-point correlations in physical space. The new law is shown to have a
compact expression that contains a single flux term reminiscent of the
incompressible case and a source term with a simple expression whose sign is
given by the divergence of the velocity. The law is then used to investigate
the properties of such a turbulence at integral Mach number $4$ produced by a
massive numerical simulation with a grid resolution of $10,048^3$ points. The
flux (resp. source) term was found to have positive (resp. negative)
contribution to the total energy cascade rate, which is interpreted as a direct
cascade amplified by compression, while their sum is constant in the inertial
range. Using a local (in space) analysis it is shown that the source is mainly
driven by filamentary structures in which the flux is negligible. Taking
positive defined correlations reveals the existence of different turbulent
regimes separated by the sonic scale, which determines the scale over which the
non-negligible source modifies the scaling of the flux. Our study provides new
insight into the dynamics and structures of supersonic interstellar turbulence.

codebook based beam training scheme is proposed. The layer-1 codebook is
designed based on the omnidirectionality of a random-phase beam pattern, which
estimates the UE distance with training overhead equivalent to that of one DFT
codeword. Then, based on the estimated UE distance, the layer-2 codebook is
generated to scan candidate UE locations and obtain the optimal codeword for
IRS beamforming. Numerical results show that compared with benchmarks, the
proposed two-layer beam training scheme achieves more accurate UE distance and
angle estimation, higher data rate, and smaller training overhead.

molecular test for breast cancer assay that provides prognostic and predictive
breast cancer recurrence information for hormone positive, HER2-negative

physicians in their decision-making. Methods: A retrospective study between
2012 and 2020 with 333 cases that underwent an ODX assay from three hospitals
in Bourgogne Franche-Comt{\'e} was conducted. Clinical and pathological reports
were used to collect the data. A methodology based on distributional random
forest was developed using 9 clinico-pathological characteristics. This
methodology can be used particularly to identify the patients of the training
cohort that share similarities with the new patient and to predict an estimate
of the distribution of the ODX score. Results: The mean age of participants id
56.9 years old. We have correctly classified 92% of patients in low risk and
40.2% of patients in high risk. The overall accuracy is 79.3%. The proportion
of low risk correct predicted value (PPV) is 82%. The percentage of high risk
correct predicted value (NPV) is approximately 62.3%. The F1-score and the Area
Under Curve (AUC) are of 0.87 and 0.759, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed
methodology makes it possible to predict the distribution of the ODX score for
a patient and provides an explanation of the predicted score. The use of the
methodology with the pathologist's expertise on the different histological and
immunohistochemical characteristics has a clinical impact to help oncologist in

sources of gas ionization across the host and a swarm of companion galaxies.
The quasar dominates the photoionization, but we also discover shock-excited
regions orthogonal to the ionization cone and the quasar-driven outflow. These
shocks could be merger-induced or -- more likely, given the presence of a
powerful galactic-scale quasar outflow -- these are signatures of wide-angle
outflows that can reach parts of the galaxy that are not directly illuminated
by the quasar. Finally, the kinematically narrow emission associated with the
host galaxy presents as a collection of 1 kpc-scale clumps forming stars at a
rate of at least 200 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The ISM within these clumps shows
high electron densities, reaching up to 3,000 cm$^{-3}$ with metallicities
ranging from half to a third solar with a positive metallicity gradient and V
band extinctions up to 3 magnitudes. The star formation conditions are far more
extreme in these regions than in local star-forming galaxies but consistent
with that of massive galaxies at cosmic noon. JWST observations reveal an
archetypical rapidly forming massive galaxy undergoing a merger, a clumpy
starburst, an episode of obscured near-Eddington quasar activity, and an

enable to constrain cosmological parameters more precisely than previous

ways to reduce uncertainties on cosmological parameters. To this end, we start
our investigation even from the likelihood assumption of Gaussianity,
implicitly used in this domain. Indeed, the usual practise involves
constraining parameters through a Gaussian distance moduli likelihood. This
method relies on the implicit assumption that the difference between the
distance moduli measured and the ones expected from the cosmological model is
Gaussianly distributed. In this work, we test this hypothesis for both the

this requirement is not fulfilled and the actual underlying distributions are a
logistic and a Student's t distribution for the \textit{Pantheon} and

disorders. Patient recruitment for rare or specific diseases is often limited
due to their small patient size and episodic observations, whereas prevalent
cases accumulate longitudinal data easily due to regular follow-ups. These
data, however, are notorious for their irregularity, temporality, absenteeism,
and sparsity. In this study, we leveraged self-supervised learning (SSL) and
transfer learning to overcome the above-mentioned barriers, transferring
patient progress trends in cardiovascular laboratory parameters from prevalent
cases to rare or specific cardiovascular events detection. We pretrained a
general laboratory progress (GLP) pretrain model using hypertension patients
(who were yet to be diabetic), and transferred their laboratory progress trend
to assist in detecting target vessel revascularization (TVR) in percutaneous
coronary intervention patients. GLP adopted a two-stage training process that
utilized interpolated data, enhancing the performance of SSL. After pretraining
GLP, we fine-tuned it for TVR prediction. The proposed two-stage training
process outperformed SSL. Upon processing by GLP, the classification
demonstrated a marked improvement, increasing from 0.63 to 0.90 in averaged
accuracy. All metrics were significantly superior (p < 0.01) to the performance
of prior GLP processing. The representation displayed distinct separability
independent of algorithmic mechanisms, and diverse data distribution trend. Our
approach effectively transferred the progression trends of cardiovascular
laboratory parameters from prevalent cases to small-numbered cases, thereby
demonstrating its efficacy in aiding the risk assessment of cardiovascular
events without limiting to episodic observation. The potential for extending
this approach to other laboratory tests and diseases is promising.

Existing schemes to certify such non-classical resources in a

different parts of a multipartite quantum system. In this letter, we propose
and experimentally implement a semi-device independent certification technique

specific correlated coins from pairs of photons entangled in their transverse

coin tossing. We establish the advantage by showing that the correlated coin
procured from the entangled photons cannot be obtained from any two 2-level
classical correlated coins. The quantum advantage requires performing qubit
trine positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) on each part of the entangled
pair, thus also certifying such POVMs in a semi-device-independent manner. This
proof of concept firmly establishes a new cost-effective certification
technique for both, generating non-classical shared randomness and implementing
non-classical measurements which will be important for future multi-party

involves estimating a potentially high-dimensional log partition function. In
this work, we present a unifying view of existing MI bounds from the
perspective of importance sampling, and propose three novel bounds based on
this approach. Since accurate estimation of MI without density information
requires a sample size exponential in the true MI, we assume either a single
marginal or the full joint density information is known. In settings where the
full joint density is available, we propose Multi-Sample Annealed Importance
Sampling (AIS) bounds on MI, which we demonstrate can tightly estimate large
values of MI in our experiments. In settings where only a single marginal
distribution is known, we propose Generalized IWAE (GIWAE) and MINE-AIS bounds.
Our GIWAE bound unifies variational and contrastive bounds in a single
framework that generalizes InfoNCE, IWAE, and Barber-Agakov bounds. Our
MINE-AIS method improves upon existing energy-based methods such as MINE-DV and
MINE-F by directly optimizing a tighter lower bound on MI. MINE-AIS uses MCMC
sampling to estimate gradients for training and Multi-Sample AIS for evaluating
the bound. Our methods are particularly suitable for evaluating MI in deep
generative models, since explicit forms of the marginal or joint densities are
often available. We evaluate our bounds on estimating the MI of VAEs and GANs
trained on the MNIST and CIFAR datasets, and showcase significant gains over
existing bounds in these challenging settings with high ground truth MI.

aligned high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) training image pairs.
Unfortunately, such HQ-LQ training pairs are hard to capture in practice, and
hard to synthesize due to the complex unknown degradation in the wild. While
several sophisticated degradation models have been manually designed to
synthesize LQ images from their HQ counterparts, the distribution gap between
the synthesized and real-world LQ images remains large. We propose a new
approach to synthesizing realistic image restoration training pairs using the
emerging denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM).
  First, we train a DDPM, which could convert a noisy input into the desired LQ
image, with a large amount of collected LQ images, which define the target data
distribution. Then, for a given HQ image, we synthesize an initial LQ image by
using an off-the-shelf degradation model, and iteratively add proper Gaussian
noises to it. Finally, we denoise the noisy LQ image using the pre-trained DDPM
to obtain the final LQ image, which falls into the target distribution of
real-world LQ images. Thanks to the strong capability of DDPM in distribution
approximation, the synthesized HQ-LQ image pairs can be used to train robust
models for real-world image restoration tasks, such as blind face image
restoration and blind image super-resolution. Experiments demonstrated the
superiority of our proposed approach to existing degradation models. Code and

degradation of deep neural networks trained on noisy labels. In this work, we
for the first time introduce a benchmark for label error detection methods on
object detection datasets as well as a label error detection method and a
number of baselines. We simulate four different types of randomly introduced
label errors on train and test sets of well-labeled object detection datasets.
For our label error detection method we assume a two-stage object detector to
be given and consider the sum of both stages' classification and regression
losses. The losses are computed with respect to the predictions and the noisy
labels including simulated label errors, aiming at detecting the latter. We
compare our method to three baselines: a naive one without deep learning, the
object detector's score and the entropy of the classification softmax
distribution. We outperform all baselines and demonstrate that among the
considered methods, ours is the only one that detects label errors of all four
types efficiently. Furthermore, we detect real label errors a) on commonly used
test datasets in object detection and b) on a proprietary dataset. In both
cases we achieve low false positives rates, i.e., when considering 200
proposals from our method, we detect label errors with a precision for a) of up
to 71.5% and for b) with 97%.

systems. Its key concept is how and where to make the aggregation of each set
of user information into an individual entity, such as a ranked recommendation
list, a virtual user, or a multi-hot input vector encoding. This paper proposes
an innovative strategy where aggregation is made in the multi-hot vector that
feeds the neural network model. The aggregation provides a probabilistic
semantic, and the resulting input vectors feed a model that is able to
conveniently generalize the group recommendation from the individual
predictions. Furthermore, using the proposed architecture, group
recommendations can be obtained by simply feedforwarding the pre-trained model
with individual ratings; that is, without the need to obtain datasets
containing group of user information, and without the need of running two
separate trainings (individual and group). This approach also avoids
maintaining two different models to support both individual and group learning.
Experiments have tested the proposed architecture using three representative
collaborative filtering datasets and a series of baselines; results show
suitable accuracy improvements compared to the state-of-the-art.

that the rich are more sensitive to others' incomes than the poor, and that the
effect of income inequality on consumption differs qualitatively across groups.
Importantly, it explains this fourth stylised fact without falling back on
differences in preferences across groups, as required in other models. In

signal-to-noise ratio. The attack effect is then studied by formulating the
secret key rate with a relationship to the deployment of RIS. To resist such

3-space to complement the headset's tracking as the hands leave the tracking

from just the continuous estimation of hand orientation, which by itself is

simultaneously detects finger pinching to register off-screen selection events,
confirms them using a haptic actuator inside our wrist device, and thus allows
users to select, grab, and drop virtual content. We compared HOOV's performance
with a camera-based optical motion capture system in two folds. In the first
evaluation, participants interacted based on tracking information from the
motion capture system to assess the accuracy of their proprioceptive input,

We found that HOOV's target-agnostic estimations had a mean tracking error of

sidebands are interfered by down-conversion with the carrier. By choosing
amplitude and phases of the sidebands, suppression of either common amplitude

of frequency shifts and quality factors of resonators. Test measurements were
performed on NbN superconducting resonators at 25 mK to calibrate and
characterise the experimental setup, and to study time-dependent fluctuations

increasing HOs due to network densification in the 5G evolution and various HO
skipping techniques have so far been studied in the literature to suppress
excessive HOs. In this paper, we propose yet another HO skipping scheme, called
periodic HO skipping. The proposed scheme prohibits the HOs of a mobile user
equipment (UE) for a certain period of time, referred to as skipping period,
thereby enabling flexible operation of the HO skipping by adjusting the length
of the skipping period. We investigate the performance of the proposed scheme
on the basis of stochastic geometry. Specifically, we derive analytical
expressions of two performance metrics -- the HO rate and the expected downlink
data rate -- when a UE adopts the periodic HO skipping. Numerical results based
on the analysis demonstrate that the periodic HO skipping scenario can
outperform the scenario without any HO skipping in terms of a certain utility
metric representing the trade-off between the HO rate and the expected downlink
data rate, in particular when the UE moves fast. Furthermore, we numerically
show that there can exist an optimal length of the skipping period, which
locally maximizes the utility metric, and approximately provide the optimal
skipping period in a simple form. Numerical comparison with some other HO

opened an era in which social theories can be tested against empirical
evidence, allowing human behaviour to be analyzed just as any other natural
phenomenon. The present contribution focuses on balance theory, stating that
social agents tend to avoid the formation of `unbalanced', or `frustrated',
cycles, i.e. cycles with an odd number of negative links. Such a statement can
be made statistically rigorous only after a comparison with a null model. Since
the existing ones cannot account for the heterogeneity of individual actors,
we, first, extend the Exponential Random Graphs framework to binary,
undirected, signed networks with local constraints and, then, employ both
homogeneous and heterogeneous benchmarks to compare the empirical abundance of
short cycles with its expected value, on several, real-world systems. What
emerges is that the level of balance in real-world networks crucially depends
on (at least) three factors, i.e. the measure adopted to quantify it, the
nature of the data, the null model employed for the analysis. As an example,
the study of triangles reveals that homogeneous null models with global
constraints tend to favour the weak version of balance theory, according to
which only the triangle with one negative link should be under-represented in
real, social and political networks; on the other hand, heterogeneous null
models with local constraints tend to favour the strong version of balance
theory, according to which also the triangle with all negative links should be
under-represented in real, social networks. Biological networks, instead, are
found to be significantly frustrated under any benchmark considered here.

magnetization in the metallic ferromagnet ($Ni_{80}Fe_{20}$) injects spin
current into the topological insulator ($BiSbTe_{1.5}Se_{1.5}$), a phenomenon
known as spin-pumping. Due to the spin pumping effect, fast relaxation in the
ferromagnet results in the broadening of ferromagnetic resonance linewidth
($\Delta H$). We evaluated the parameters like effective Gilbert damping
coefficient ($\alpha_{eff}$), spin-mixing conductance ($g_{eff}^{\uparrow
\downarrow}$) and spin current density ($j_S^0$) to confirm a successful spin
injection due to spin-pumping into the $BiSbTe_{1.5}Se_{1.5}$ layer. TIs embody
a spin-momentum locked surface state that span the bulk band-gap. It can act
differently to the FM magnetization than the other normal metals. To probe the
effect of topological surface state, a systematic low temperature study is
crucial as surface state of TI dominates at lower temperatures. The exponential
growth of $\Delta H$ for all different thickness combination of FM/TI bilayers

spin-pumping induces surface current in TI due to spin-momentum locking. The

propagation equation by Fourier transformation, multiplication with a transfer
function, and subsequent back transformation. This transfer function is
determined from the respective dispersion relation and can often be expanded as
a polynomial. In the case of paraxial wave propagation in free space or
picosecond pulse propagation, this expansion can be truncated after the
quadratic term. The classical solution to the wave propagation requires
$\mathcal{O}(N log N)$ computation steps, where $N$ is the number of points
into which the wave function is discretized. Here, we show that the propagation
can be performed as a quantum algorithm with $\mathcal{O}((log{}N)^2)$
single-controlled phase gates, indicating exponentially reduced computational
complexity. We herein demonstrate this quantum beam propagation method (QBPM)

always be realized even with the small binding energy. At the same time,
however, it is shown that a fine tuning is necessary to obtain the
non-composite weakly bound state. In other words, the probability to find a
model with the composite dominant state becomes larger with the decrease of the
binding energy in accordance with the low-energy universality. For the
application to the exotic hadrons, we then discuss the modification of the
compositeness by the decay and coupled-channel effects. We quantitatively show
that these contributions suppress the compositeness, because of the increase of
the fraction of other components. Finally, as the examples of the
near-threshold exotic hadrons, the structure of $T_{cc}$ and $X(3872)$ is
studied by evaluating the compositeness. We find the importance of the
coupled-channel and decay contributions for the structure of $T_{cc}$ and
$X(3872)$, respectively.

a more specific class of graphical models. On the other hand, Gaussianity
allows us to regularize the estimation, requiring less samples than in existing

He i 10830 {\AA} narrowband filtergrams taken by the Goode Solar Telescope
(GST). The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) counterparts present during the eruption
correspond to a blowout jet (jet 1) and a standard jet (jet 2), as observed by
the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory
(SDO). The high-resolution He i 10830 {\AA} observation captures a long-lasting
precursor for jet 1, signified by a series of cool ejections. They are
recurrent jet-like features with a quasi-period of about five minutes. On the
other hand, the cool components of jet 2, recurrently accompanied by EUV
emissions, present a quasi-periodic behavior with a period of about five
minutes. Both the EUV brightening and He i 10830 {\AA} absorption show that
there was a precursor for jet 2 that occurred about five minutes before its

chromospheric shock waves, since the five-minute oscillation from the
photosphere can leak into the chromosphere and develop into shocks. Then, we
find that the quasi-periodic behavior of the cool components of jet 2 may be
related to magnetic reconnections modulated by the oscillation in the

promising impacts to transform healthcare in all aspects. One application is to
triage patients' radiological medical images based on the algorithm's binary

triage and notification (CADt). Their main benefit is to speed up radiological
review of images with time-sensitive findings. However, as CADt devices become
more common in clinical workflows, there is still a lack of quantitative
methods to evaluate a device's effectiveness in saving patients' waiting times.
In this paper, we present a mathematical framework based on queueing theory to
calculate the average waiting time per patient image before and after a CADt
device is used. We study four workflow models with multiple radiologists
(servers) and priority classes for a range of AI diagnostic performance,
radiologist's reading rates, and patient image (customer) arrival rates. Due to
model complexity, an approximation method known as the Recursive Dimensionality
Reduction technique is applied. We define a performance metric to measure the
device's time-saving effectiveness. A software tool is developed to simulate
clinical workflow of image review/interpretation, to verify theoretical
results, and to provide confidence intervals of the performance metric we
defined. It is shown quantitatively that a triage device is more effective in a
busy, short-staffed setting, which is consistent with our clinical intuition
and simulation results. Although this work is motivated by the need for
evaluating CADt devices, the framework we present in this paper can be applied

  Qubits","6 pages, 1 figure",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper reports a quantum algorithm for simulating quantum chemical
systems of N molecular orbitals(MOs) using $4\log N +2$ qubits. The number of
multi-electron configurations scales exponentially with the number of MOs and
is the primary bottleneck in calculating the energy of a many-electron system.
This paper introduces qubitized Hamiltonian downfolding(QHD) by combining the
techniques of qubitized quantum walks and Hamiltonian downfolding to reduce the
active space dimension systematically. At each stage of QHD, the number of
many-electron configurations is reduced by $1/4$ by decoupling the molecular
orbital (MO) farthest from the highest occupied MO (HOMO). The sequence of such
downfolding steps enables us to scale towards the low-energy HOMO-LUMO window.
For each stage of downfolding, we map the \emph{decoupling condition} i.e., a
many-body normal-ordered Bloch equation to a system of quadratic polynomial
equations. These downfolding equations can be solved using a non-linear least
squares (NLLS) approach within error $\epsilon$. Each step of NLLS involves a
Hessian inversion and comprises a quantum linear system problem(QLSP). We
describe quantum circuits that block-encode the Hessian using qubitization
oracles. Subsequently, we implement the Chebyshev expansion for solving the
QLSP within error $\epsilon'$, utilizing a sequence of qubitized quantum walks.
Starting from an N-orbital system the gate complexity of each downfolding
circuit scales as $O(N^{2}\log^{2}(1/\epsilon'))$ and for downfolding all the
MOs involve $O(N^3/\epsilon^{2})$ oracle queries.

airfoil flow. These events may be seen as examples of the kind of unsteady and
intermittent dynamics relevant to the flow around airfoils and wings in a
variety of laboratory and real-world applications. W investigate the
instability mechanisms at the heart of these extreme events, and how knowledge
thereof may be harnessed for efficient data driven forecasting. Through a
wavelet and spectral analysis of the flow we find that the extreme events arise
due to the instability of a specific frequency component distinct from the
vortex shedding mode. During these events this extreme event manifold draws
energy from the energetically dominant vortex shedding flow and undergoes an
abrupt energy transfer from small to large scales. We also investigate the
spatial dependence of the temporal correlation and mutual information between
the surface pressure and the aerodynamic forces, with the aim of identifying
regions of the airfoil amenable to sparse sensing and the efficient forecasting
of extremes. Building on previous work, we show that relying solely on the
mutual information for optimal sensor placement fails to improve model
prediction over uniform or random sensor placement. However, we show that by
isolating the extreme event frequency component offline through a wavelet
transform we are able to circumvent the requirement for a recursive long-short
term memory (LSTM) network -- resulting in a significant reduction in
computational complexity over the previous state of the art. Using the wavelet
pre-processed data in conjunction with an extreme event-tailored loss function
we find that our model is capable of forecasting extreme events using only
three pressure sensors. Furthermore, we find our model to be robust to sensor
location -- showing promise for the use of our model in dynamically varying

lengthscales of supramolecular morphologies is a broad and persistent theme in
self-assembled soft materials, from biological to synthetic matter. Here, we
analyze the mechanism of chirality transfer in a prototypical self-assembly
system, block copolymers (BCPs), in particular, its impact on one of the most
complex and functionally vital phases: the cubic, triply-periodic, gyroid
network. Motivated by recent experimental studies, we consider a
self-consistent field model of ABC* triblock copolymers possessing an end-block
of chain chemistry and examine the interplay between chirality at the scale of
networks, in alternating double network phases, and the patterns of segmental
order within tubular network domains. We show that while segments in gyroids
exhibit twist in both polar and nematic segmental order parameters, the
magnitude of net nematic twist is generically much larger than polar twist, and
more surprising, {\it reverses handedness} relative to the sense of polar order
as well as the sense of dihedral twist of the network. Careful analysis of the
intra-domain nematic order reveals that this unique chirality transfer
mechanism relies on the strongly biaxial nature of segmental order in BCP
networks and relates the {\it biaxial twist} to complex patterns of frame
rotation of the principal directors in the intra-domain texture. Finally, we
show that this mechanism of twist reversal leads to chirality selection of
alternating gyroid networks in ABC* triblocks, in the limit of very weak
chirality .

through the full-integer topological defects. We study theoretically the effect
of both polar and dipolar active forces on the flow profile around $\pm 1$
defects and their interaction in the presence of both viscosity and frictional
dissipation. The vorticity induced by the active stress is non-zero at the $+1$
defect contributing to the active torque acting on the defect. A near-core flow
reversal is predicted in absence of hydrodynamic screening (zero friction) as
observed in numerical simulations. While $\pm 1$ defects are sources of
spontaneous flows due to active stresses, they become sinks of flows induced by
the polar active forces. We show analytically that the flow velocity induced by
polar active forces increases away from a $\pm 1$ defect towards the uniform
far-field, while its associated vorticity field decays as $1/r$ in the
far-field. In the friction-dominated regime, we demonstrate that the flow
induced by polar active forces enhances defect pair annihilation, and depends
only on the orientation between a pair of oppositely charged defects relative
to the orientation of the background polarization field. Interestingly, we find
that this annihilation dynamics through mutual defect-defect interactions is
distance independent, in contradiction with the effect of dipolar active forces
which decay inversely proportional to the defect separation distance. As such,
our analyses reveals a new, truly long-ranged mechanism for the pairwise

from a large number of personal edge devices (e.g., mobile phones) while

However, such a cross-device FL approach for health diagnostics still imposes
many challenges due to both local data imbalance (as extreme as local data
consists of a single disease class) and global data imbalance (the disease
prevalence is generally low in a population). Since the federated server has no
access to data distribution information, it is not trivial to solve the
imbalance issue towards an unbiased model. In this paper, we propose FedLoss, a
novel cross-device FL framework for health diagnostics. Here the federated
server averages the models trained on edge devices according to the predictive
loss on the local data, rather than using only the number of samples as
weights. As the predictive loss better quantifies the data distribution at a
device, FedLoss alleviates the impact of data imbalance. Through a real-world
dataset on respiratory sound and symptom-based COVID-$19$ detection task, we
validate the superiority of FedLoss. It achieves competitive COVID-$19$

factors, such as programming experience and domain knowledge, the effect of

  Aims: We aim at unraveling the relationship between efficacy (speed and
correctness) and measures of programming experience. We further investigate the
correlates of programmer efficacy in terms of reading behavior and cognitive
load.
  Method: For this purpose, we conducted a controlled experiment with
37~participants using electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking. We asked
participants to comprehend up to 32 Java source-code snippets and observed
their eye gaze and neural correlates of cognitive load. We analyzed the
correlation of participants' efficacy with popular programming experience
measures.
  Results: We found that programmers with high efficacy read source code more
targeted and with lower cognitive load. Commonly used experience levels do not
predict programmer efficacy well, but self-estimation and indicators of
learning eagerness are fairly accurate.
  Implications: The identified correlates of programmer efficacy can be used
for future research and practice (e.g., hiring). Future research should also
consider efficacy as a group sampling method, rather than using simple
experience measures.

interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) and stream interaction region (SIR)

field measurements from Tianwen-1/MOMAG and Mars Atmospheric Volatile EvolutioN

consistency between them. Due to MAVEN's orbital adjustment since 2019, the
Tianwen-1/MOMAG instrument is currently the almost unique interplanetary
magnetic field monitor at Mars. The observations indicate that the MOMAG
instrument on Tianwen-1 is performing well and can provide accurate
measurements of the vector magnetic field in the near-Mars solar wind space.
The multi-point observations combining MOMAG, MINPA, and MEPA on board
Tianwen-1 with MAG, SWIA, and STATIC on board MAVEN will open a window to
systematically study the characteristic of ICMEs and SIRs at Mars, and their

However, their high computational and memory costs make them impractical to

improve existing quantization methods and propose a gold guideline for
post-training quantization. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed
method with two popular models, ResNet50 and MobileNetV2, on the ImageNet

directly quantizing the model to 8-bits without additional training. A
quantization-aware training based on the guidelines can further improve the
accuracy in lower-bits quantization. Moreover, we have integrated a multi-stage
fine-tuning strategy that works harmoniously with existing pruning techniques
to reduce costs even further. Remarkably, our results reveal that a quantized
MobileNetV2 with 30\% sparsity actually surpasses the performance of the
equivalent full-precision model, underscoring the effectiveness and resilience

research, both from an experimental and a theoretical perspective. We explore
the concept of implementing quantum measurements by coupling a many-body
lattice system to an ancillary degree of freedom (implemented using two
additional sites), on which projective measurements are performed. We analyze
the effect of repeated (``stroboscopic'') measurements on the dynamical
correlations of interacting hard-core bosons in a one-dimensional chain. An
important distinctive ingredient of the protocol is the fact that the detector
ancillas are not re-initialized after each measurement step. The detector thus
maintains memory of the accumulated influence by the measured correlated
system. Initially, we consider a model in which the ancilla is coupled to a
single lattice site. This setup allows obtaining information about the system
through Rabi oscillations in the ancillary degrees of freedom, modulated by the
ancilla-system interaction. The statistics of quantum trajectories exhibits a
``quantum-Zeno-valve effect'' that occurs when the measurement becomes strong,
with sharp branching between low and high entanglement. We proceed by extending
numerical simulations to the case of two ancillas and, then, to measurements on
all sites. With this realistic measurement apparatus, we find evidence of a
disentangling-entangling measurement-induced transition as was previously
observed in more abstract models. The dynamics features a broad distribution of
the entanglement entropy.

minimum eigenvalue/vector of a given Hamiltonian by optimizing a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) using a classical computer. Sequential optimization
methods, which are often used in quantum circuit tensor networks, are popular
for optimizing the parametrized gates of PQCs. This paper focuses on the case
where the components to be optimized are single-qubit gates, in which the
analytic optimization of a single-qubit gate is sequentially performed. The
analytical solution is given by diagonalization of a matrix whose elements are
computed from the expectation values of observables specified by a set of
predetermined parameters which we call the parameter configurations. In this
study, we first show that the optimization accuracy significantly depends on
the choice of parameter configurations due to the statistical errors in the
expectation values. We then identify a metric that quantifies the optimization
accuracy of a parameter configuration for all possible statistical errors,
named configuration overhead/cost or C-cost. We theoretically provide the lower
bound of C-cost and show that, for the minimum size of parameter
configurations, the lower bound is achieved if and only if the parameter
configuration satisfies the so-called equiangular line condition. Finally, we
provide numerical experiments demonstrating that the optimal parameter
configuration exhibits the best result in several VQE problems. We hope that
this general statistical methodology will enhance the efficacy of sequential
optimization of PQCs for solving practical problems with near-term quantum
devices.

in a dynamical background, we study a cold atomic Bose-Fermi mixture in an

the deep superfluid regime, inherit the periodicity of the optical lattice and
subsequently act as a dynamical potential for the polarized fermions. Due to
the atom-phonon interaction between the fermions and the condensate, the
coupled system displays a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition from a
Luttinger liquid to a Peierls phase. For sufficiently strong Bose-Fermi
interaction, however, the Peierls phase becomes unstable and is succeeded by
either a collapsed or a separated phase. We find that the main role of the
optical lattice amounts to stabilizing the Peierls phase. Furthermore, the
presence of a confining harmonic trap leads to a rich physical behaviour beyond
what is observed for either bosons or fermions separately trapped. In
particular, for an attractive Bose-Fermi interaction, the insulating phase may
develop a fermionic wedding-cake like configuration reflecting the dynamical
nature of the underlying lattice potential. For repulsive interaction, on the
other hand, we conclude that the trap destabilizes the Peierls phase and the
two species separate.

essential part of the sensor technology for automated driving. The quality of
images captured by in-vehicle cameras highly influences the performance of
visual perception systems. This paper presents a feature-based algorithm to
detect certain effects that can degrade image quality in automotive
applications. The algorithm is based on an intelligent selection of significant
features. Due to the small number of features, the algorithm performs well even
with small data sets. Experiments with different data sets show that the
algorithm can detect soiling adhering to camera lenses and classify different
types of image degradation.

does not require complicated data pre-processing, making it applicable to
various programming languages and practical scenarios. Second, three
closely-related designs are proposed to guarantee the effectiveness of xASTNN,
including statement subtree sequence for code naturalness, gated recursive unit

excessive measurements to a factor graph can also quickly degrade their
performance as more cycles are added to the graph. In both situations, the

improve maneuverability or manipulation abilities. However, there was a
challenge in achieving both mobility and manipulation capabilities
simultaneously. This is because aerial robots with high mobility lack the
necessary rotors to perform manipulation tasks, while those with manipulation
ability are too large to achieve high mobility. To address this issue, a new
aerial robot called TRADY was introduced in this article. TRADY is a
tilted-rotor-equipped aerial robot that can autonomously assemble and
disassemble in-flight, allowing for a switch in control model between
under-actuated and fully-actuated models. The system features a novel docking
mechanism and optimized rotor configuration, as well as a control system that
can transition between under-actuated and fully-actuated modes and compensate
for discrete changes. Additionally, a new motion strategy for
assembly/disassembly motion that includes recovery behavior from hazardous

successfully execute aerial assembly/disassembly motions with a 90% success
rate and generate more than nine times the torque of a single unit in the

especially recently proposed Source-free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), has become a
promising technology to address this issue. Nevertheless, existing SFDA methods
require that the source domain and target domain share the same label space,
consequently being only applicable to the vanilla closed-set setting. In this
paper, we take one step further and explore the Source-free Universal Domain
Adaptation (SF-UniDA). The goal is to identify ""known"" data samples under both
domain and category shift, and reject those ""unknown"" data samples (not present

learning technique (GLC). Specifically, we design a novel, adaptive one-vs-all
global clustering algorithm to achieve the distinction across different target

different category shift scenarios, including partial-set, open-set, and

penumbra formation, it has been difficult to find observational evidence of the
connectivity between the photosphere and the chromosphere. We investigate the
existence of a chromospheric canopy as a necessary condition for the formation
of a penumbra and aim to find the origin of the inclined magnetic fields.
Spectropolarimetric observations of NOAA AR 12776 from the GRIS@GREGOR
instrument were analyzed. Atmospheric parameters were obtained from the deep
photospheric Ca I 10839 {\AA} line (VFISV inversion code), the mostly
photospheric Si I 10827 {\AA} line (SIR inversion code) and the chromospheric
He I 10830 {\AA} triplet (HAZEL inversion code). In the deepest atmospheric
layers, we find that the magnetic properties (inclination and field strength
distribution) measured on the sunspot sector with fully fledged penumbra are
similar to those measured on the sector without penumbra. Yet, in higher
layers, magnetic properties are different. In the region showing no penumbra,
almost vertical chromospheric magnetic fields are observed. Additionally, thin
filamentary structures with a maximum width of 0.1 arcsec are seen in
photospheric high-resolution TiO-band images in this region. The existence of a
penumbra is found to be discriminated by the conditions in the chromosphere.
This indicates that a chromospheric canopy is a necessary condition for the
formation of a penumbra. However, our results demonstrate that inclined fields
in the chromospheric canopy are not needed for the development of inclined
fields in the photosphere. We question the `fallen-magnetic-flux-tubes'
penumbra formation scenario and favor a scenario, in which inclined fields
emerge from below the surface and are blocked by the overlying chromospheric
canopy.

parameterized in the tangent space of diffeomorphisms(a.k.a velocity fields).
In contrast to previous methods that purely fit the training images, our
proposed NeurEPDiff learns a nonlinear mapping function between the
time-dependent velocity fields. A composition of integral operators and smooth
activation functions is formulated in each layer of NeurEPDiff to effectively
approximate such mappings. The fact that NeurEPDiff is able to rapidly provide
the numerical solution of EPDiff (given any initial condition) results in a
significantly reduced computational cost of geodesic shooting of

of discretiztion/resolution-invariant of NeurEPDiff make its performance
generalizable to multiple image resolutions after being trained offline. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of NeurEPDiff in registering two image datasets:
2D synthetic data and 3D brain resonance imaging (MRI). The registration

e-fuels, such as short-chain oxymethylene ethers are prone to flash
vaporization phenomena, which is associated with the formation and growth of
vapor bubbles, followed by explosive bursting of the liquid jet. The simulation
of a flash boiling spray of such highly volatile liquid fuels in the context of
automotive or cryogenic engines is numerically challenging due to several
reasons, including (1) the complexity of the bubble growth process in the
presence of multiple vapor bubbles and (2) the need to use an extremely small
time step size to accurately capture the underlying physics associated with the
flash boiling process. In this paper, we first present a bubble growth model in
flash boiling microdroplets considering bubble interactions along with the
finite droplet size effects. Based on the dimensional analysis of the newly
derived Rayleigh Plesset equation, a simplified semi-analytical solution for
bubble growth, which also includes the bubble interactions, is then derived to
estimate the bubble growth behavior with reasonable accuracy using the larger
time step sizes for a wide range of operating conditions. The derived
semi-analytical solution is shown to be a good approximation for describing the
bubble growth rate over the whole lifetime of the bubble. The bubble
interactions are found to delay the onset of droplet bursting due to the slower
growth of the vapor bubble compared to the bubble growth without bubble
interactions. Furthermore, in a comparison with DNS results, the proposed
bubble growth model is shown to reasonably capture the impact of bubble
interactions leading to smaller volumetric droplet expansion.

an auxiliary multimodal decoder. At these branches, Mirror U-Net assigns a task

cascading deep learning model VMCDL based on source code control flow to

we introduce a pretraining-assisted on-cloud model elastification method and an
edge-friendly on-device architecture search method. Model elastification
generates a high-quality search space of model architectures with the guidance
of a developer-specified oracle model. Each subnet in the space is a valid
model with different environment affinity, and each device efficiently finds
and maintains the most suitable subnet based on a series of edge-tailored
optimizations. Extensive experiments on various edge devices demonstrate that
our approach is able to achieve significantly better accuracy-latency tradeoffs
(e.g. 46.74\% higher on average accuracy with a 60\% latency budget) than
strong baselines with minimal overhead (13 GPU hours in the cloud and 2 minutes

take place.
  We prove that there is a theory of irreducible mutation for maximal rigid

mutation in triangulated categories and cluster tilting mutation. By
constructing suitable extriangulated categories, we also recover tau-tilting

with results by Adachi-Tsukamoto and Pauksztello-Zvonareva, our mutation also
provides mutation for intermediate co-t-structures.

However, characterizing the optimality, particularly the minimax lower bound,
under privacy constraints is technically difficult.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called the score attack,
which provides a lower bound on the differential-privacy-constrained minimax
risk of parameter estimation. The score attack method is based on the tracing
attack concept in differential privacy and can be applied to any statistical
model with a well-defined score statistic. It can optimally lower bound the
minimax risk of estimating unknown model parameters, up to a logarithmic
factor, while ensuring differential privacy for a range of statistical
problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness and optimality of this general
method in various examples, such as the generalized linear model in both
classical and high-dimensional sparse settings, the Bradley-Terry-Luce model
for pairwise comparisons, and nonparametric regression over the Sobolev class.

questionnaire takes, the higher the probability that participants lose interest
and start responding carelessly. Consequently, in long surveys a large number
of participants may engage in careless responding, posing a major threat to
internal validity. We propose a novel method to identify the onset of careless
responding (or an absence thereof) for each participant. Specifically, our
method is based on combined measurements of up to three dimensions in which
carelessness may manifest (inconsistency, invariability, fast responding).
Since a structural break in either dimension is potentially indicative of
carelessness, our method searches for evidence for changepoints along the three
dimensions. Our method is highly flexible, based on machine learning, and
provides statistical guarantees on its performance. In simulation experiments,
we find that it achieves high reliability in correctly identifying carelessness
onset, discriminates well between careless and attentive respondents, and can
capture a wide variety of careless response styles, even in datasets with an
overwhelming presence of carelessness. In addition, we empirically validate our
method on a Big 5 measurement. Furthermore, we provide freely available

the slow system. Using the theory of convergence of gradient systems depending
on a small paramter $\varepsilon$ (here the ratio between the slow and the fast
time scale) in the sense of the ""energy-dissipation principle"" (EDP) shows that
there is a natural characterization of these non-equilibrium steady states as
saddle points of a Lagrangian where the slow variables are fixed. We give
applications to slow-fast reaction-diffusion systems based on the so-called
cosh-type gradient structure for reactions. It is shown that two binary
reaction give rise to a ternary reaction with a state-dependent reaction
coefficient. Moreover, we show that a reaction-diffusion equation with a thin
membrane-like layer convergences to a transmission condition, where the
formerly quadratic dissipation potential for diffusion convergences to a
cosh-type dissipation potential for the transmission in the membrane limit.

multi-label annotation enjoys richer supervision information than single-label,
which makes multi-view multi-label learning widely applicable for various
pattern recognition tasks. In this complex representation learning problem,
three main challenges can be characterized as follows: i) How to learn
consistent representations of samples across all views? ii) How to exploit and
utilize category correlations of multi-label to guide inference? iii) How to
avoid the negative impact resulting from the incompleteness of views or labels?
To cope with these problems, we propose a general multi-view multi-label
learning framework named label-guided masked view- and category-aware
transformers in this paper. First, we design two transformer-style based
modules for cross-view features aggregation and multi-label classification,
respectively. The former aggregates information from different views in the
process of extracting view-specific features, and the latter learns subcategory
embedding to improve classification performance. Second, considering the
imbalance of expressive power among views, an adaptively weighted view fusion
module is proposed to obtain view-consistent embedding features. Third, we
impose a label manifold constraint in sample-level representation learning to
maximize the utilization of supervised information. Last but not least, all the
modules are designed under the premise of incomplete views and labels, which
makes our method adaptable to arbitrary multi-view and multi-label data.
Extensive experiments on five datasets confirm that our method has clear
advantages over other state-of-the-art methods.

the highly dynamic nature of these urban scenes, long term mapping should rely
on frequent map updates. A trivial solution is to simply replace old data with
newer data each time a new acquisition is made. However it has two drawbacks:
1) the old data may be of higher quality (resolution, precision) than the new

including varying occlusions. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic

measure of morphological changes in the lung. It has been shown that automated
detection of COPD can be performed with deep learning models. However, the
potential of incorporating optimal window setting selection, typically carried
out by clinicians during examination of CT scans for COPD, is generally
overlooked in deep learning approaches. We aim to optimize the binary
classification of COPD with densely connected convolutional neural networks
(DenseNets) through implementation of manual and automated Window-Setting
Optimization (WSO) steps. Our dataset consisted of 78 CT scans from the
Klinikum rechts der Isar research hospital. Repeated inference on the test set
showed that without WSO, the plain DenseNet resulted in a mean slice-level AUC
of 0.80$\pm$0.05. With input images manually adjusted to the emphysema window
setting, the plain DenseNet model predicted COPD with a mean AUC of
0.86$\pm$0.04. By automating the WSO through addition of a customized layer to
the DenseNet, an optimal window setting in the proximity of the emphysema
window setting was learned and a mean AUC of 0.82$\pm$0.04 was achieved.
Detection of COPD with DenseNet models was optimized by WSO of CT data to the
emphysema window setting range, demonstrating the importance of implementing
optimal window setting selection in the deep learning pipeline.

particularly concerned with equity and environmental justice, and are focused
on an advanced assessment of users' behavior through a spatial interaction

serves as a template model to assist public decision-makers at the city-level

model is about the optimal city-budget allocation to neighborhoods based on a
data exposing inequality attributes. The second-stage seeks the optimal
location and design of parks for each neighborhood, and the objective consists
of maximizing the total expected probability of individuals visiting parks. We
show how to reformulate the latter as a mixed-integer linear program. We
further introduce a clustering method to reduce the size of the problem and
determine a close to optimal solution within reasonable time. The model is
tested using the case study of the city of Montreal and comparative results are
discussed in detail to justify the performance of the model.

leverage multi-task data with less task-specific design. The most advanced
methods typically present boxes and masks as vertex sequences to model
referring detection and segmentation as an autoregressive sequential vertex
generation paradigm. However, generating high-dimensional vertex sequences
sequentially is error-prone because the upstream of the sequence remains static
and cannot be refined based on downstream vertex information, even if there is
a significant location gap. Besides, with limited vertexes, the inferior
fitting of objects with complex contours restricts the performance upper bound.
To deal with this dilemma, we propose a parallel vertex generation paradigm for
superior high-dimension scalability with a diffusion model by simply modifying
the noise dimension. An intuitive materialization of our paradigm is Parallel
Vertex Diffusion (PVD) to directly set vertex coordinates as the generation
target and use a diffusion model to train and infer. We claim that it has two
flaws: (1) unnormalized coordinate caused a high variance of loss value; (2)
the original training objective of PVD only considers point consistency but
ignores geometry consistency. To solve the first flaw, Center Anchor Mechanism
(CAM) is designed to convert coordinates as normalized offset values to
stabilize the training loss value. For the second flaw, Angle summation loss
(ASL) is designed to constrain the geometry difference of prediction and ground
truth vertexes for geometry-level consistency. Empirical results show that our
PVD achieves state-of-the-art in both referring detection and segmentation, and
our paradigm is more scalable and efficient than sequential vertex generation
with high-dimension data.

model that is standard in the case of positive polarizability) and investigate
its behavior for simple cubic (sc), body-centered cubic (bcc), and
face-centered cubic (fcc) crystals with one entity per primitive cell when the
static polarizability of the entities is negative and the mutual interaction
between the entities is taken into account. We find that the static electric
susceptibility is bounded below due to an instability towards self-polarization
but the lower permissible bound is negative definite in each case, i.e., the
concept of negative static electric susceptibility remains robust, according to
the model, when mutual interactions are taken into account. The usual
Clausius-Mossotti relation between the static polarizability and the static
electric susceptibility remains valid in the case of negative parameters, but
only down to the lower permissible bound; the value of the bound depends on the
crystal structure and is always unrelated to the asymptote of the
Clausius-Mossotti curve. The lower permissible bounds of the static electric
susceptibility are found to be -0.906 for sc, and -1.00 for bcc and fcc. These
results confirm that, although the magnitude of the static electric
susceptibility does not diverge in the negative case (as it can in the positive
case), the magnitudes attainable in the negative case for condensed media may,
nevertheless, be many orders of magnitude greater than those predicted
previously for inverted vapors and gases. This is a promising result in

is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Thus, a number of generation-based
automatic code review (ACR) approaches have been proposed recently, which
leverage deep learning techniques to automate various activities in the code
review process (e.g., code revision generation and review comment generation).
  We find the previous works carry three main limitations. First, the ACR
approaches have been shown to be beneficial in each work, but those methods are
not comprehensively compared with each other to show their superiority over
their peer ACR approaches. Second, general-purpose pre-trained models such as
CodeT5 are proven to be effective in a wide range of Software Engineering (SE)
tasks. However, no prior work has investigated the effectiveness of these
models in ACR tasks yet. Third, prior works heavily rely on the Exact Match
(EM) metric which only focuses on the perfect predictions and ignores the
positive progress made by incomplete answers. To fill such a research gap, we
conduct a comprehensive study by comparing the effectiveness of recent ACR
tools as well as the general-purpose pre-trained models. The results show that
a general-purpose pre-trained model CodeT5 can outperform other models in most
cases. Specifically, CodeT5 outperforms the prior state-of-the-art by
13.4\%--38.9\% in two code revision generation tasks. In addition, we introduce
a new metric namely Edit Progress (EP) to quantify the partial progress made by
ACR tools. The results show that the rankings of models for each task could be
changed according to whether EM or EP is being utilized. Lastly, we derive
several insightful lessons from the experimental results and reveal future
research directions for generation-based code review automation.

Sending $\epsilon$ to 0 yields convergence of the reversionary Heston model
towards different explicit asymptotic regimes based on the value of the

stream of data. Current research mainly focuses on relieving catastrophic
forgetting, and most of their success is at the cost of limiting the
performance of newly incoming tasks. Such a trade-off is referred to as the
stabilityplasticity dilemma and is a more general and challenging problem for
continual learning. However, the inherent conflict between these two concepts
makes it seemingly impossible to devise a satisfactory solution to both of them
simultaneously. Therefore, we ask, ""is it possible to divide them into two
problems to conquer independently?"" To this end, we propose a
prompt-tuning-based method termed PromptFusion to enable the decoupling of
stability and plasticity. Specifically, PromptFusion consists of a carefully
designed Stabilizer module that deals with catastrophic forgetting and a
Booster module to learn new knowledge concurrently. During training,
PromptFusion first passes an input image to the two modules separately. Then
the resulting logits are further fused with a learnable weight parameter.
Finally, a weight mask is applied to the derived logits to balance between old

results on popular continual learning datasets for both class-incremental and

the per-frame prediction for videos of high frame rates. In recent work,
compact models or adaptive network strategies have been proposed for efficient
VSS. However, they did not consider a crucial factor that affects the
computational cost from the input side: the input resolution. In this paper, we
propose an altering resolution framework called AR-Seg for compressed videos to
achieve efficient VSS. AR-Seg aims to reduce the computational cost by using
low resolution for non-keyframes. To prevent the performance degradation caused
by downsampling, we design a Cross Resolution Feature Fusion (CReFF) module,
and supervise it with a novel Feature Similarity Training (FST) strategy.
Specifically, CReFF first makes use of motion vectors stored in a compressed
video to warp features from high-resolution keyframes to low-resolution
non-keyframes for better spatial alignment, and then selectively aggregates the
warped features with local attention mechanism. Furthermore, the proposed FST
supervises the aggregated features with high-resolution features through an
explicit similarity loss and an implicit constraint from the shared decoding
layer. Extensive experiments on CamVid and Cityscapes show that AR-Seg achieves
state-of-the-art performance and is compatible with different segmentation
backbones. On CamVid, AR-Seg saves 67% computational cost (measured in GFLOPs)
with the PSPNet18 backbone while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Code:

years. Our recent paper (Spencer et al., 2022) looked again at the minor flares
(flux density S of a few 100 mJy) and compared their properties with those of a
sample of major flares (S > 1 Jy). We find that the minor flares have rise
times and duration of ~ 1 hour, as opposed to ~ days for the major flares.
Minor flares show more rapid expansion of the synchrotron radiation emitting
material than in the strong flares. They also appear closer to the binary,
whereas the large flares form a more developed jet, i.e. the jets formed in
minor flares are short and wide, those in major flares are long and thin. We
used the results of Fender & Bright (2019) to calculate the magnetic field and
expansion velocity as a fraction B of the speed of light under minimum energy
conditions when the source is optically thick for samples of minor and major
flares. The minimum power in the source was found using the rise time of the
flares. The minor flares have lower minimum power but have larger velocities
and energy densities than the major flares. Minor flares can occur while a
major flare is in progress, suggesting an indirect coupling between them. The
spectral evolution of the minor flares can be explained by either an expanding
synchrotron source or a shock model. Further investigation requires high
resolution VLBI observations at the 1 mas level if we wish to understand the
development of the source. The problem is that Cygnus X-3 is strongly scattered
by the interstellar medium so high frequencies in the several 10s of GHz are
required for the resolution needed. The minor flares are rapid [...] and hence
only short snapshot VLBI observations can capture the structure. Large numbers
of telescopes are required which is a problem at the highest frequencies. We
discuss the VLBI possibilities and trade-offs for this awkward object.

be used in next-generations wireless systems. This led to a large body of
research work that applies ML techniques to solve problems in different layers
of the wireless transmission link. However, most of these applications rely on
supervised learning which assumes that the source (training) and target (test)
data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d). This assumption is
often violated in the real world due to domain or distribution shifts between
the source and the target data. Thus, it is important to ensure that these
algorithms generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this context,
domain generalization (DG) tackles the OOD-related issues by learning models on
different and distinct source domains/datasets with generalization capabilities
to unseen new domains without additional finetuning. Motivated by the
importance of DG requirements for wireless applications, we present a
comprehensive overview of the recent developments in DG and the different
sources of domain shift. We also summarize the existing DG methods and review
their applications in selected wireless communication problems, and conclude
with insights and open questions.

  Values, Distribution and Prices, Reproduction and Profits",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This book starts from the basic questions that had been raised by the
founders of Economic theory, Smith, Ricardo, and Marx: what makes the value of
commodities, what are production, exchange, money and incomes like profits,
wages and rents. The answers that these economists had provided were mostly
wrong, above all by defining the equivalence of commodities at the level of
exchange, but also because of a confusion made between values and prices, and
wrong views of what production really is and the role of fixed capital. Using
the mathematical theory of measurement and the physical theory of dimensional
analysis, this book provides a coherent theory of value based on an equivalence
relation not at the level of exchange, but of production. Indeed exchange is
considered here as an equivalence relation between money and a monetary price,
and not between commodities, modern monetary theory having demonstrated that
money is not a commodity. The book rejects the conception of production as a
surplus, which owes much to Sraffa's theory of production prices, and is shown
to be severely flawed. It founds the equivalence of commodities at the level of
a production process considered as a transformation process. It rehabilitates
the labor theory of value, based on the connection between money and labor due
the monetary payment of wages, which allows the homogenization of various kinds
of concrete labor into abstract labor. It shows that value is then a dimension
of commodities and that this dimension is time, i.e. the time of physics. On
this background, the book shows that the calculation of values for all
commodities is always possible, even in the case of joint production, and that
there cannot be any commodity residue left by this calculation. As a further
step, this book provides a coherent theory of the realization of the product,
which occurs in the circulation process. Using an idea - the widow's cruse -
introduced by Keynes in his Treatise on Money, it brings to light the mechanism
behind the transformation of money values into money prices and of
surplus-value into profits and other transfer incomes, ensuring the formation
of monetary profits. The book sheds some light on the rate of profit, its
determinants and its evolution, showing in particular the paramount importance
of capitalist consumption as one of its main determinants. In passing it
explains the reasons why in the real world there is a multiplicity of profit
rates. Finally, it allows to solve in a precise and illustrated way the
problems raised by the Marxist law of the tendency of the rate of profit to
fall. Most of the results obtained translate into principles, the first ones
being truly basic, the following ones less basic, but all of them being
fundamental. All in all, this book might provide the first building blocks to
develop a full-fledged and scientific economic theory to many fellow
economists, critical of neo-classical theory, but who have not yet dicovered
the bases of a complete and coherent alternative.

multisensor multitarget tracking where the local, inter-connected sensors run
different types of random finite set (RFS) filters according to their
respective capacity and need. They result in heterogenous multitarget densities
that are to be fused with each other in a proper means for more robust and
accurate detection and localization of the targets. Our recent work has exposed
a key common property of effective arithmetic average (AA) fusion approaches to
both unlabeled and labeled RFS filters which are all built on averaging their
relevant un-labeled/labeled probability hypothesis densities (PHDs). Thanks to
this, this paper proposes the first ever heterogenous unlabeled and labeled RFS
filter cooperation approach based on Gaussian mixture implementations where the
local Gaussian components (L-GCs) are so optimized that the resulting unlabeled
PHDs best fit their AA, regardless of the specific type of the local densities.
To this end, a computationally efficient, approximate approach is proposed
which only revises the weights of the L-GCs, keeping the other parameters of
L-GCs unchanged. In particular, the PHD filter, the unlabeled and labeled
multi-Bernoulli (MB/LMB) filters are considered. Simulations have demonstrated
the effectiveness of the proposed approach for both homogeneous and
heterogenous fusion of the PHD-MB- LMB filters in different configurations.

an arbitrary non-linear electrodynamic action coupled to the axion field in
presence of an isotropy four-vector that realizes the breaking of Lorentz
symmetry under the particle point of view. For the sake of our considerations,
the non-linear electromagnetic field is expanded around a constant and uniform
magnetic background up to second order in the propagating photon field. The
focus of our attention is the study of the material properties of the vacuum in
the particular case of a space-like CFJ $4$-vector. The dispersion relations
associated to the plane wave solutions are explicitly worked out in two
situations: the magnetic background perpendicular and parallel to the wave
direction. We extend these results to consider the analysis of the
birefringence phenomenon in presence of non-linearity, the axion and the LSV
manifested through the spatial anisotropy. Three specific proposals of
non-linear electrodynamics are contemplated: Euler-Heisenberg (EH), Born-Infeld
(BI) and the Modified Maxwell electrodynamics (ModMax). Throughout the paper,
we shall justify why we follow the unusual path of connecting, in a single

non-linearity, axions and LSV.

a finite fuzzy interpretation in a FDL by using the largest crisp
auto-bisimulation. The considered FDLs use the Baaz projection operator and
their semantics is specified using an abstract algebra of fuzzy truth values,
which can be any linear and complete residuated lattice. We provide an
efficient algorithm with a complexity of $O((m \log{l} + n) \log{n})$ for

relatively expensive in the recent decades. A significant part of the
maintenance operation costs is spent on the technical staff. Therefore, the
optimal use of the available workforce is essential to optimize the operation
costs. This includes planning technical interventions, workload balancing,
productivity improvement, etc. In this paper, we focus on the routing of
technicians and scheduling of their tasks. We address for this purpose a
variant of the workforce scheduling problem called the technician routing and
scheduling problem (TRSP). This problem has applications in different fields,
such as transportation infrastructure (rail and road networks),
telecommunications, and sewage facilities. To solve the TRSP, we propose an
enhanced iterated local search (eILS) approach. The enhancement of the ILS
firstly includes an intensification procedure that incorporates a set of local
search operators and removal-repair heuristics crafted for the TRSP. Next, four
different mechanisms are used in the perturbation phase. Finally, an elite set
of solutions is used to extensively explore the neighborhood of local optima as
well as to enhance diversification during search space exploration. To measure
the performance of the proposed method, experiments were conducted based on
benchmark instances from the literature, and the results obtained were compared
with those of an existing method. Our method achieved very good results, since
it reached the best overall gap, which is three times lower than that of the

learn the statistical models necessary for decision-making, measured data from
the structure of interest are required. Unfortunately, these data are seldom
available across the range of environmental and operational conditions
necessary to ensure good generalisation of the model.
  Recently, technologies have been developed that overcome this challenge, by
extending SHM to populations of structures, such that valuable knowledge may be
transferred between instances of structures that are sufficiently similar. This
new approach is termed population-based structural heath monitoring (PBSHM).
  The current paper presents a formal representation of populations of
structures, such that risk-based decision processes may be specified within
them. The population-based representation is an extension to the hierarchical
representation of a structure used within the probabilistic risk-based decision
framework to define fault trees. The result is a series, consisting of systems
of systems ranging from the individual component level up to an inventory of

creative skill for creating prompt-based art. In three studies with
participants recruited from a crowdsourcing platform, we explore whether
untrained participants could 1) recognize the quality of prompts, 2) write
prompts, and 3) improve their prompts. Our results indicate that participants
could assess the quality of prompts and respective images. This ability
increased with the participants' experience and interest in art. Participants
further were able to write prompts in rich descriptive language. However, even
though participants were specifically instructed to generate artworks,
participants' prompts were missing the specific vocabulary needed to apply a
certain style to the generated images. Our results suggest that prompt
engineering is a learned skill that requires expertise and practice. Based on

inflation is not a trivial task, as its prediction relies on low frequency,
highly fluctuating data with unclear explanatory variables. While classical
models show some possibility of predicting inflation, reliably beating the
random walk benchmark remains difficult. Recently, (deep) neural networks have
shown impressive results in a multitude of applications, increasingly setting
the new state-of-the-art. This paper investigates the potential of the
transformer deep neural network architecture to forecast different inflation
rates. The results are compared to a study on classical time series and machine
learning models. We show that our adapted transformer, on average, outperforms
the baseline in 6 out of 16 experiments, showing best scores in two out of four
investigated inflation rates. Our results demonstrate that a transformer based
neural network can outperform classical regression and machine learning models
in certain inflation rates and forecasting horizons.

climatic conditions. The development of research-action interfaces shifts
useful ideas into operationalized knowledge allowing innovation to flourish. In
this paper we quantify the existing gap between climate research and innovation
action in Europe using a novel framework that combines artificial intelligence
(AI) methods and network science. We compute the distance between key topics of
research interest from peer review publications and core issues tackled by
innovation projects funded by the most recent European framework programmes.
Our findings reveal significant differences exist between and within the two
layers. Economic incentives, agricultural and industrial processes are
differently connected to adaptation and mitigation priorities. We also find a
loose research-action connection in bioproducts, biotechnologies and risk
assessment practices, where applications are still too few compared to the
research insights. Our analysis supports policy-makers to measure and track how
research funding result in innovation action, and to adjust decisions if stated
priorities are not achieved.

representation learning in the direction of functional knowledge transfer. In
this work, functional knowledge transfer is achieved by joint optimization of
self-supervised learning pseudo task and supervised learning task, improving
supervised learning task performance. Recent progress in self-supervised
learning uses a large volume of data, which becomes a constraint for its
applications on small-scale datasets. This work shares a simple yet effective
joint training framework that reinforces human-supervised task learning by
learning self-supervised representations just-in-time and vice versa.
Experiments on three public datasets from different visual domains, Intel
Image, CIFAR, and APTOS, reveal a consistent track of performance improvements
on classification tasks during joint optimization. Qualitative analysis also
supports the robustness of learnt representations. Source code and trained
models are available on GitHub.

  Contextualized Sentence Embeddings",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Training and inference on edge devices often requires an efficient setup due
to computational limitations. While pre-computing data representations and
caching them on a server can mitigate extensive edge device computation, this
leads to two challenges. First, the amount of storage required on the server
that scales linearly with the number of instances. Second, the bandwidth
required to send extensively large amounts of data to an edge device. To reduce
the memory footprint of pre-computed data representations, we propose a simple,
yet effective approach that uses randomly initialized hyperplane projections.
To further reduce their size by up to 98.96%, we quantize the resulting
floating-point representations into binary vectors. Despite the greatly reduced
size, we show that the embeddings remain effective for training models across
various English and German sentence classification tasks that retain 94%--99%
of their floating-point.

cloud service and social network, ciphertext has been gradually becoming a
common platform for public to exchange data. Under the cover of such a
plat-form, we propose steganography in encrypted domain (SIED) in this paper to
re-alize a novel method to realize secret communication Based on Simmons' model
of prisoners' problems, we discuss the application scenarios of SIED. According
to the different accesses to the encryption key and decryption key for secret
mes-sage sender or receiver, the application modes of SIED are classified into
four modes. To analyze the security requirments of SIED, four levels of
steganalysis attacks are introduced based on the prior knowledge about the
steganography system that the attacker is assumed to obtain in advance. Four
levels of security standards of SIED are defined correspondingly. Based on the
existing reversible data hiding techniques, we give four schemes of SIED as
practical instances with different security levels. By analyzing the embedding
and extraction characteris-tics of each instance, their SIED modes, application
frameworks and security lev-els are discussed in detail.

quantum circuits), many of the associated issues there are similar to those
encountered in electronic IC design and can be addressed using Bayesian
methods. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive review of
Bayesian methods in electronic design automation (EDA). By doing so, we hope to
equip researchers and designers with the ability to apply Bayesian methods in
solving stochastic problems in electronic circuits and beyond.

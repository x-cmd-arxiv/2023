  dynamic responses",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a damage detection method based on the train-induced
responses of high-speed railway box girder. Under the coupling effects of
bending and torsion, the traditional damage detection method based on the Euler
beam theory cannot be applied. In this research, the box girder section is
divided into different components based on the plate element analysis method.
The strain responses were preprocessed based on Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) method to remove the influence of train operation variation. The residual
error of autoregressive (AR) model was used as a potential index of damage
features. The optimal order of the model was determined based on Bayesian
information criterion (BIC) criterion. Finally, the confidence boundary (CB) of
damage features (DF) constituting outliers can be estimated by Gaussian inverse
cumulative distribution function (ICDF). The numerical simulation results show
that the proposed method in this paper can effectively identify, locate and
quantify the damage, which verifies the accuracy of the proposed method. The
proposed method effectively identifies the early damage of all components on
the key section by using four strain sensors, and it is helpful for developing
effective maintenance strategies for high-speed railway box girder.

has been partially overcome by a hybrid-TDDFT approach. We show that the key
resides in the numerical treatment of the long-range Coulomb singular term. We
carefully study the effect of this term, both in the pure-TDDFT and hybrid

adaption to new settings with different clinical findings without relying on

workflow, methods should be transparent and explainable, increasing medical
professionals' trust and facilitating correctness verification. In this work,
we introduce Xplainer, a novel framework for explainable zero-shot diagnosis in
the clinical setting. Xplainer adapts the classification-by-description
approach of contrastive vision-language models to the multi-label medical
diagnosis task. Specifically, instead of directly predicting a diagnosis, we
prompt the model to classify the existence of descriptive observations, which a
radiologist would look for on an X-Ray scan, and use the descriptor
probabilities to estimate the likelihood of a diagnosis. Our model is
explainable by design, as the final diagnosis prediction is directly based on
the prediction of the underlying descriptors. We evaluate Xplainer on two chest
X-ray datasets, CheXpert and ChestX-ray14, and demonstrate its effectiveness in
improving the performance and explainability of zero-shot diagnosis. Our
results suggest that Xplainer provides a more detailed understanding of the
decision-making process and can be a valuable tool for clinical diagnosis.

increase the robustness of AI-generated text detection to paraphrase attacks,
we introduce a simple defense that relies on retrieving semantically-similar

conserve fluid volume. Meshfree particle methods like SPH are not mimetic, in
the sense that discrete mass conservation does not imply discrete volume
conservation. On the other hand, meshfree collocation methods typically do not
use any notion of mass. As a result, they are neither mass conservative nor
volume conservative at the discrete level. In this paper, we give an overview
of various sources of conservation errors across different meshfree methods.
The present work focuses on one specific issue: unreliable volume and mass
definitions. We introduce the concept of representative masses and densities,
which are essential for accurate post-processing especially in meshfree
collocation methods. Using these, we introduce an artificial compression or
expansion in the fluid to rectify errors in volume conservation. Numerical
experiments show that the introduced frameworks significantly improve volume
conservation behaviour, even for complex industrial test cases such as
automotive water crossing.

theory has only one type of dynamics, namely unitary evolution. Passive quantum
theory shares many features with standard quantum theory. These include
preparational uncertainty relations, the impossibility to dynamically clone
unknown quantum states and the absence of signalling. However, striking
differences emerge when protocols involve post-measurement states. For example,
in the collapse-free setting, no ensemble is needed to reconstruct the state of
a system by passively measuring a tomographically complete set of observables -
a single system will do. Effectively, the state becomes an observable quantity,
with implications for both the ontology of the theory and its computational
power. At the same time, the theory is not locally tomographic and passive

deployment of advantageous quantum computing. To mitigate this constraint,
techniques have been developed to break up a large quantum computation into
smaller computations. While this work is sometimes called circuit knitting or
divide and quantum we generically refer to it as circuit cutting (CC). Much of
the existing work has focused on the development of more efficient circuit
cutting schemes, leaving open questions on the limits of what theoretically
optimal schemes can achieve. We develop bounds by breaking up possible
approaches into two distinct regimes: the first, where the input state and
measurement are fixed and known, and the second, which requires a given cutting
to work for a complete basis of input states and measurements. For the first
case, it is easy to see that bounds addressing the efficiency of any approaches
to circuit cutting amount to resolving BPP$\stackrel{?}{=}$BQP. We therefore
restrict ourselves to a simpler question, asking what \textit{locally-acting}
circuit cutting schemes can achieve, a technical restriction which still
includes all existing circuit cutting schemes. In our first case we show that
the existence of a locally-acting circuit cutting scheme which could
efficiently partition even a single qubit from the rest of a circuit would
imply BPP$=$BQP. In our second case, we obtain more general results, showing
inefficiency unconditionally. We also show that any (local or otherwise)

  generation",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Diffusion-based models for text-to-image generation have gained immense
popularity due to recent advancements in efficiency, accessibility, and
quality. Although it is becoming increasingly feasible to perform inference
with these systems using consumer-grade GPUs, training them from scratch still
requires access to large datasets and significant computational resources. In
the case of medical image generation, the availability of large, publicly
accessible datasets that include text reports is limited due to legal and
ethical concerns. While training a diffusion model on a private dataset may
address this issue, it is not always feasible for institutions lacking the
necessary computational resources. This work demonstrates that pre-trained
Stable Diffusion models, originally trained on natural images, can be adapted
to various medical imaging modalities by training text embeddings with textual
inversion. In this study, we conducted experiments using medical datasets
comprising only 100 samples from three medical modalities. Embeddings were
trained in a matter of hours, while still retaining diagnostic relevance in
image generation. Experiments were designed to achieve several objectives.
Firstly, we fine-tuned the training and inference processes of textual
inversion, revealing that larger embeddings and more examples are required.
Secondly, we validated our approach by demonstrating a 2\% increase in the
diagnostic accuracy (AUC) for detecting prostate cancer on MRI, which is a
challenging multi-modal imaging modality, from 0.78 to 0.80. Thirdly, we
performed simulations by interpolating between healthy and diseased states,
combining multiple pathologies, and inpainting to show embedding flexibility
and control of disease appearance. Finally, the embeddings trained in this
study are small (less than 1 MB), which facilitates easy sharing of medical
data with reduced privacy concerns.

for the challenging unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) task. They typically
adopt the cross-attention in ViT for direct domain alignment. However, as the
performance of cross-attention highly relies on the quality of pseudo labels
for targeted samples, it becomes less effective when the domain gap becomes
large. We solve this problem from a game theory's perspective with the proposed
model dubbed as PMTrans, which bridges source and target domains with an
intermediate domain. Specifically, we propose a novel ViT-based module called
PatchMix that effectively builds up the intermediate domain, i.e., probability
distribution, by learning to sample patches from both domains based on the
game-theoretical models. This way, it learns to mix the patches from the source
and target domains to maximize the cross entropy (CE), while exploiting two
semi-supervised mixup losses in the feature and label spaces to minimize it. As
such, we interpret the process of UDA as a min-max CE game with three players,
including the feature extractor, classifier, and PatchMix, to find the Nash
Equilibria. Moreover, we leverage attention maps from ViT to re-weight the
label of each patch by its importance, making it possible to obtain more
domain-discriminative feature representations. We conduct extensive experiments
on four benchmark datasets, and the results show that PMTrans significantly
surpasses the ViT-based and CNN-based SoTA methods by +3.6% on Office-Home,
+1.4% on Office-31, and +17.7% on DomainNet, respectively.

how best to achieve this synergy, for both the category setting and the
fine-grained setting (""all""). At the very core of our solution is a prompt
learning setup. First we show just via factoring in sketch-specific prompts, we
already have a category-level ZS-SBIR system that overshoots all prior arts, by
a large margin (24.8%) - a great testimony on studying the CLIP and ZS-SBIR
synergy. Moving onto the fine-grained setup is however trickier, and requires a
deeper dive into this synergy. For that, we come up with two specific designs
to tackle the fine-grained matching nature of the problem: (i) an additional
regularisation loss to ensure the relative separation between sketches and
photos is uniform across categories, which is not the case for the gold
standard standalone triplet loss, and (ii) a clever patch shuffling technique
to help establishing instance-level structural correspondences between
sketch-photo pairs. With these designs, we again observe significant
performance gains in the region of 26.9% over previous state-of-the-art. The
take-home message, if any, is the proposed CLIP and prompt learning paradigm
carries great promise in tackling other sketch-related tasks (not limited to

manipulation capabilities. Yet, we haven't witnessed widespread adoption of
these capabilities beyond the laboratory. This is likely due to practical
limitations, such as significant computational burden, inscrutable policy
architectures, sensitivity to parameter initializations, and the considerable
technical expertise required for implementation. In this work, we investigate
the utility of Koopman operator theory in alleviating these limitations.
Koopman operators are simple yet powerful control-theoretic structures that
help represent complex nonlinear dynamics as linear systems in
higher-dimensional spaces. Motivated by the fact that complex nonlinear
dynamics underlie dexterous manipulation, we develop an imitation learning
framework that leverages Koopman operators to simultaneously learn the desired
behavior of both robot and object states. We demonstrate that a Koopman
operator-based framework is surprisingly effective for dexterous manipulation
and offers a number of unique benefits. First, the learning process is
analytical, eliminating the sensitivity to parameter initializations and
painstaking hyperparameter optimization. Second, the learned reference dynamics
can be combined with a task-agnostic tracking controller such that task changes
and variations can be handled with ease. Third, a Koopman operator-based
approach can perform comparably to state-of-the-art imitation learning
algorithms in terms of task success rate and imitation error, while being an
order of magnitude more computationally efficient. In addition, we discuss a
number of avenues for future research made available by this work.

femtoscopic study of p$-$p$-$K$^+$ and p$-$p$-$K$^-$ correlations measured in

vertex-disjoint and there are no edges joining them. Is it true that if $G$ is
a graph with bounded clique number, and sufficiently large chromatic number,
then it has two anticomplete subgraphs, both with large chromatic number? This
is a question raised by El-Zahar and Erd\H{o}s in 1986, and remains open. If
so, then at least there should be two anticomplete subgraphs both with large
minimum degree, and that is one of our results.
  We prove two variants of this. First, a strengthening: we can ask for one of
the two subgraphs to have large chromatic number: that is, for all $t, c\ge 1$
there exists $d\ge 1$ such that if $G$ has chromatic number at least $d$, and
does not contain the complete graph $K_t$ as a subgraph, then there are
anticomplete subgraphs $A,B$, where $A$ has minimum degree at least $c$ and $B$
has chromatic number at least $c$.
  Second, we look at what happens if we replace the hypothesis that $G$ has
sufficiently large chromatic number with the hypothesis that $G$ has
sufficently large minimum degree. This, together with excluding $K_t$, is {\em
not} enough to guarantee two anticomplete subgraphs both with large minimum
degree; but it works if instead of xcluding $K_t$ we exclude the complete
bipartite graph $K_{t,t}$. More exactly: for all $t, c\ge 1$ there exists $d\ge
1$ such that if $G$ has minimum degree at least $d$, and does not contain the
complete bipartite graph $K_{t,t}$ as a subgraph, then there are two
anticomplete subgraphs both with minimum degree at least $c$.

progress in the field of 3D synthesis from text. By optimizing neural radiance
fields (NeRF) directly from text, recent methods are able to produce remarkable
results. Yet, these methods are limited in their control of each object's
placement or appearance, as they represent the scene as a whole. This can be a
major issue in scenarios that require refining or manipulating objects in the
scene. To remedy this deficit, we propose a novel GlobalLocal training
framework for synthesizing a 3D scene using object proxies. A proxy represents
the object's placement in the generated scene and optionally defines its coarse
geometry. The key to our approach is to represent each object as an independent
NeRF. We alternate between optimizing each NeRF on its own and as part of the
full scene. Thus, a complete representation of each object can be learned,
while also creating a harmonious scene with style and lighting match. We show
that using proxies allows a wide variety of editing options, such as adjusting
the placement of each independent object, removing objects from a scene, or
refining an object. Our results show that Set-the-Scene offers a powerful
solution for scene synthesis and manipulation, filling a crucial gap in
controllable text-to-3D synthesis.

introduced. This is undesired, especially during passages without dialogue. We
propose to combine DS and Voice Activity Detection (VAD), both recently

background components leaking in the dialogue estimate are reassigned to the
background estimate. A clear improvement of the audio quality is shown for

light-induced dynamics in 2-iodothiophene (C$_4$H$_3$IS) is performed. The
dynamics are experimentally monitored with a femtosecond XUV probe pulse that
measures iodine N-edge 4d core-to-valence transitions. Experiments are
complemented by density functional theory calculations of both the pump-pulse
induced valence excitations as well as the XUV probe-induced core-to-valence
transitions. Possible intramolecular relaxation dynamics are investigated by ab
initio molecular dynamics simulations. Gradual absorption changes up to ~0.5-1
ps after excitation are observed for both the parent molecular species and
emerging iodine fragments, with the latter appearing with a characteristic rise
time of 160$\pm$30 fs. Comparison of spectral intensities and energies with the
calculations identify an iodine dissociation pathway initiated by a predominant
$\pi\to\pi^*$ excitation. In contrast, initial excitation to a nearby
n$_\perp\to\sigma^*$ excited state appears unlikely based on a significantly
smaller oscillator strength and the absence of any corresponding XUV absorption
signatures. Excitation to the $\pi\to\pi^*$ state is followed by contraction of
the C-I bond, enabling a nonadiabatic transition to a dissociative
$\pi\to\sigma_\textrm{C-I}^*$ state. For the subsequent fragmentation, a narrow
bond-length region along the C-I stretch coordinate between 260 and 280 pm is
identified, where the transition between the parent molecule and the thienyl
radical + iodine atom products becomes prominent in the XUV spectrum due to
rapid localization of two singly-occupied molecular orbitals on the two
fragments.

and agents in it, and enables rendering the environment from a controllable
viewpoint. Similarly to a game engine, it models the logic of the game and the
underlying rules of physics, to make it possible for a user to play the game by
specifying both high- and low-level action sequences. Most captivatingly, our
LGE unlocks the director's mode, where the game is played by plotting behind
the scenes, specifying high-level actions and goals for the agents in the form
of language and desired states. This requires learning ""game AI"", encapsulated
by our animation model, to navigate the scene using high-level constraints,
play against an adversary, devise the strategy to win a point. The key to
learning such game AI is the exploitation of a large and diverse text corpus,
collected in this work, describing detailed actions in a game and used to train
our animation model. To render the resulting state of the environment and its
agents, we use a compositional NeRF representation used in our synthesis model.
To foster future research, we present newly collected, annotated and calibrated
large-scale Tennis and Minecraft datasets. Our method significantly outperforms
existing neural video game simulators in terms of rendering quality. Besides,
our LGEs unlock applications beyond capabilities of the current state of the
art. Our framework, data, and models are available at

perturbation, which are typically significantly less than suggested by the
perturbation's operator norm. This stability has numerous consequences: we can
(1) find timescales where the solution of Schrodinger's equation converges to
the ground state of a block, (2) lower bound the convergence to the global
ground state by demonstrating convergence to some other known quantum state,
(3) guarantee faster convergence than the standard adiabatic theorem when the
ground state of the perturbed Hamiltonian ($H$) is close to that of the
unperturbed $H$, and (4) bound tunneling effects in terms of the global
spectral gap when $H$ is ``stoquastic'' (a $Z$-matrix). Our results apply to
quantum annealing protocols with faster convergence than usually guaranteed by

pairs collaborated on three information-seeking tasks over Slack. Participants
were unable to search on their own and had to gather information by interacting
with a \emph{searchbot} directly from the Slack channel. The role of the
searchbot was played by a reference librarian. Conversational search systems
must be capable of engaging in \emph{mixed-initiative} interaction by taking
and relinquishing control of the conversation to fulfill different objectives.
Discourse analysis research suggests that conversational agents can take
\emph{two} levels of initiative: dialog- and task-level initiative. Agents take
dialog-level initiative to establish mutual belief between agents and
task-level initiative to influence the goals of the other agents. During the
study, participants were exposed to three experimental conditions in which the
searchbot could take different levels of initiative: (1) no initiative, (2)
only dialog-level initiative, and (3) both dialog- and task-level initiative.
In this paper, we focus on understanding the Wizard's actions. Specifically, we
focus on understanding the Wizard's motivations for taking initiative and their
rationale for the timing of each intervention. To gain insights about the
Wizard's actions, we conducted a stimulated recall interview with the Wizard.
We present findings from a qualitative analysis of this interview data and

unlabelled points under Euclidean isometry. The Lipschitz continuity of
required invariants in a suitable metric under perturbations of points is
motivated by the inevitable noise in measurements of real objects.
  The best solved case of this isometry classification is known as the SSS
theorem in school geometry saying that any triangle up to congruence (isometry
in the plane) has a continuous complete invariant of three side lengths.
  However, there is no easy extension of the SSS theorem even to four points in
the plane partially due to a 4-parameter family of 4-point clouds that have the
same six pairwise distances. The computational time of most past metrics that
are invariant under isometry was exponential in the size of the input. The
final obstacle was the discontinuity of previous invariants at singular
configurations, for example, when a triangle degenerates to a straight line.
  All the challenges above are now resolved by the Simplexwise Centred
Distributions that combine inter-point distances of a given cloud with the new
strength of a simplex that finally guarantees the Lipschitz continuity. The
computational times of new invariants and metrics are polynomial in the number
of points for a fixed Euclidean dimension.

object relations, another important pillar in the visual world, remains
unexplored. In this work, we propose ReVersion for the Relation Inversion task,
which aims to learn a specific relation (represented as ""relation prompt"") from
exemplar images. Specifically, we learn a relation prompt from a frozen
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. The learned relation prompt can then
be applied to generate relation-specific images with new objects, backgrounds,
and styles. Our key insight is the ""preposition prior"" - real-world relation
prompts can be sparsely activated upon a set of basis prepositional words.
Specifically, we propose a novel relation-steering contrastive learning scheme
to impose two critical properties of the relation prompt: 1) The relation
prompt should capture the interaction between objects, enforced by the
preposition prior. 2) The relation prompt should be disentangled away from
object appearances. We further devise relation-focal importance sampling to
emphasize high-level interactions over low-level appearances (e.g., texture,
color). To comprehensively evaluate this new task, we contribute ReVersion
Benchmark, which provides various exemplar images with diverse relations.
Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our approach over existing
methods across a wide range of visual relations.

strategies, protocols that can effectively control feature distortion, i.e.,
the failure to update features orthogonal to the in-distribution, have been
found to achieve improved out-of-distribution generalization (OOD). In order to
limit this distortion, the LP+FT protocol, which first learns a linear probe
and then uses this initialization for subsequent FT, was proposed. However, in
this paper, we find when adaptation protocols (LP, FT, LP+FT) are also
evaluated on a variety of safety objectives (e.g., calibration, robustness,

protocol behavior. To this end, we study the susceptibility of protocols to
simplicity bias (SB), i.e. the well-known propensity of deep neural networks to
rely upon simple features, as SB has recently been shown to underlie several
problems in robust generalization. Using a synthetic dataset, we demonstrate
the susceptibility of existing protocols to SB. Given the strong effectiveness
of LP+FT, we then propose modified linear probes that help mitigate SB, and
lead to better initializations for subsequent FT. We verify the effectiveness
of the proposed LP+FT variants for decreasing SB in a controlled setting, and
their ability to improve OOD generalization and safety on three adaptation

deformation and articulation. This is helped by a new silhouette-based sampling
mechanism to enhance viewpoint diversity during training. Our method only
requires estimated object silhouettes and relative depth maps from
off-the-shelf pre-trained networks during training. At inference time, given a
single-view image, it efficiently outputs an explicit mesh representation. We
obtain improved qualitative and quantitative results on challenging quadruped
animals compared to relevant existing work.

(JWST) uses three Si:As impurity band conduction (IBC) detector arrays. The
output voltage level of each MIRI detector pixel is digitally recorded by
sampling-up-the-ramp. For uniform or low-contrast illumination, the pixel ramps
become non-linear in a predictable way, but in areas of high contrast, the
non-linearity curve becomes much more complex. We provide observational
evidence of the Brighter-Fatter Effect (BFE) in MIRI conventional and
high-contrast coronographic imaging, low-resolution spectroscopy, and
medium-resolution spectroscopy data and investigate the physical mechanism that
gives rise to the effect on the detector pixel raw voltage integration ramps.
We use public data from the JWST/MIRI commissioning and Cycle 1 phase. We also
develop a numerical electrostatic model of the MIRI detectors using a modified
version of the public Poisson_CCD code. The physical mechanism behind the MIRI
BFE is fundamentally different to that of CCDs and Hawaii-2RG (H2RG) detectors.
This is due to the largest majority of the MIRI photo-excited electric charges
not being stored at the pixels but at the input to the MIRI detector unit cell
buffer amplifier capacitance. The resulting detector voltage debiasing alters
the electrostatic potential inside the infrared-active layer and causes new
photo-excited electrons, generated at a bright pixel, to be guided to the
neighboring fainter pixels. Observationally, the debiasing-induced BFE makes
the JWST MIRI data yield 10-25 % larger and 0.5-8 % brighter point sources and
spectral line profiles as a function of the output level covered by the
detector pixels. We find that the profile of the shrinking detector depletion
region has implications for developing a pixel ramp non-linearity model for
point sources observed with MIRI.

visual and text features, so that the detector performs well on unseen classes.
Previous approaches train the feature pyramid and detection head from scratch,
which breaks the vision-text feature alignment established during pretraining,
and struggles to prevent the language model from forgetting unseen classes.
  We propose three methods to alleviate these issues. Firstly, a simple scheme
is used to augment the text embeddings which prevents overfitting to a small
number of classes seen during training, while simultaneously saving memory and
computation. Secondly, the feature pyramid network and the detection head are
modified to include trainable gated shortcuts, which encourages vision-text
feature alignment and guarantees it at the start of detection training.
Finally, a self-training approach is used to leverage a larger corpus of
image-text pairs thus improving detection performance on classes with no human
annotated bounding boxes.
  Our three methods are evaluated on the zero-shot version of the LVIS

VideoTaskformer using a simple and effective objective: predicting weakly
supervised textual labels for steps that are randomly masked out from an
instructional video (masked step modeling). Compared to prior work which learns
step representations locally, our approach involves learning them globally,
leveraging video of the entire surrounding task as context. From these learned

outperforms previous baselines on these tasks, and we believe the tasks will be
a valuable way for the community to measure the quality of step

DJRD includes a newly designed Quad Bayer remosaicing (QB-Re) block, integrated
denoising modules based on Swin-transformer and multi-scale wavelet transform.
The QB-Re block constructs the convolution kernel based on the CFA pattern to
achieve a periodic color distribution in the perceptual field, which is used to
extract exact spectral information and reduce color misalignment. The
integrated Swin-Transformer and multi-scale wavelet transform capture non-local

accretor, which likely originated as a post-common envelope carbon-oxygen (CO)
white dwarf, and a warm donor ($T_{\rm eff,\,donor}= 16,400\pm1000\,\rm K$).
The donor probably formed during a common envelope phase between the CO white
dwarf and an evolving giant which left behind a helium star or helium white
dwarf in a close orbit with the CO white dwarf. We measure gravitational
wave-driven orbital inspiral with $\sim 35\sigma$ significance, which yields a
joint constraint on the component masses and mass transfer rate. While the
accretion disk in the system is dominated by ionized helium emission, the donor
exhibits a mixture of hydrogen and helium absorption lines. Phase-resolved
spectroscopy yields a donor radial-velocity semi-amplitude of $771\pm27\,\rm
km\, s^{-1}$, and high-speed photometry reveals that the system is eclipsing.
We detect a {\it Chandra} X-ray counterpart with $L_{X}\sim 3\times

likely evolve into either a stably mass-transferring helium CV, merge to become
an R Crb star, or explode as a Type Ia supernova in the next million years. We
predict that the Laser Space Interferometer Antenna (LISA) will detect the
source with a signal-to-noise ratio of $24\pm6$ after 4 years of observations.
The system is the first \emph{LISA}-loud mass-transferring binary with an

hosted in galaxies that are significantly more massive

Ca-rich IIb SNe we find a trend of decreasing envelope radius with increasing

SE-SNe and Ca-rich SNe in the literature, demonstrating that SN~2021bxu-like

from multiple 2D input views. However, a well-known drawback of NeRFs is the
less-than-ideal performance under a small number of views, due to insufficient
constraints enforced by volumetric rendering. To address this issue, we
introduce SCADE, a novel technique that improves NeRF reconstruction quality on
sparse, unconstrained input views for in-the-wild indoor scenes. To constrain
NeRF reconstruction, we leverage geometric priors in the form of per-view depth
estimates produced with state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models,
which can generalize across scenes. A key challenge is that monocular depth
estimation is an ill-posed problem, with inherent ambiguities. To handle this
issue, we propose a new method that learns to predict, for each view, a
continuous, multimodal distribution of depth estimates using conditional
Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (cIMLE). In order to disambiguate
exploiting multiple views, we introduce an original space carving loss that
guides the NeRF representation to fuse multiple hypothesized depth maps from
each view and distill from them a common geometry that is consistent with all
views. Experiments show that our approach enables higher fidelity novel view
synthesis from sparse views. Our project page can be found at

we find that FIR polarization is a better tracer of the $B$-fields along the

unseen distributions by deriving dataset-level error estimates from
sample-level scores. However, GEPs often utilize disparate mechanisms (e.g.,
regressors, thresholding functions, calibration datasets, etc), to derive such
error estimates, which can obfuscate the benefits of a particular scoring
function. Therefore, in this work, we rigorously study the effectiveness of
popular scoring functions (confidence, local manifold smoothness, model
agreement), independent of mechanism choice. We find, absent complex
mechanisms, that state-of-the-art confidence- and smoothness- based scores fail
to outperform simple model-agreement scores when estimating error under
distribution shifts and corruptions. Furthermore, on realistic settings where
the training data has been compromised (e.g., label noise, measurement noise,
undersampling), we find that model-agreement scores continue to perform well
and that ensemble diversity is important for improving its performance.
Finally, to better understand the limitations of scoring functions, we
demonstrate that simplicity bias, or the propensity of deep neural networks to
rely upon simple but brittle features, can adversely affect GEP performance.
Overall, our work carefully studies the effectiveness of popular scoring
functions in realistic settings and helps to better understand their
limitations.

metals whose mechanical behaviors are very different from body-centered cubic
(bcc) and face-centered cubic (fcc) metals and the underlying mechanisms remain
poorly-understood. It has been long known that Mg has high hardening and low
ductility, and this was conventionally attributed to the scarce of active
pyramidal slip. Recently immobilization of pyramidal dislocations was proposed
to be the origins. Here we present a different scenario that has hitherto never
been reported for Mg: mobile screw pyramidal dislocations double cross-slip and
continue to double cross-slip as they glide, generating abundant vacancy
clusters on the slipped planes. These vacancy clusters hinder subsequent
dislocation motion and thus directly result in hardening; their accumulation as
plastic deformation proceeds eventually causes premature fracture, i.e.
brittleness. The massive damage accompanying pyramidal slip discovered here
provides a different explanation for the long known hardening and brittleness
of Mg, and suggests that sufficient amount of pyramidal dislocations could
still be insufficient to effectively accommodate plasticity. Stabilizing
pyramidal dislocation motion to avoid cross-slip and subsequent damage
generation is also essential for property-improvement. The instability of
pyramidal slip, manifested as continuous cross-slip here (could be different
elsewhere), originates from its huge Burgers vector and could be a common
feature of its kind. The detailed cross-slip mechanism also provides insights
into the poorly known instabilities and complicated behavior of dislocations in
a broader range of crystals with low symmetry and/or large Burgers vectors,
including other hcp metals and ceramics.

such as secure military receivers, often the radar and communications signals
are overlaid in the received signal. In these passive listening outposts, the
signals and channels of both radar and communications are unknown to the
receiver. The ill-posed problem of recovering all signal and channel parameters
from the overlaid signal is terms as dual-blind deconvolution (DBD). In this
work, we investigate a more challenging version of DBD with a multi-antenna
receiver. We model the radar and communications channels with a few (sparse)
continuous-valued parameters such as time delays, Doppler velocities, and
directions-of-arrival (DoAs). To solve this highly ill-posed DBD, we propose to
minimize the sum of multivariate atomic norms (SoMAN) that depends on the
unknown parameters. To this end, we devise an exact semidefinite program using
theories of positive hyperoctant trigonometric polynomials (PhTP). Our
theoretical analyses show that the minimum number of samples and antennas
required for perfect recovery is logarithmically dependent on the maximum of
the number of radar targets and communications paths rather than their sum. We
show that our approach is easily generalized to include several practical
issues such as gain/phase errors and additive noise. Numerical experiments show

Participants: A total of 99 participants, including 23 with mild
nonproliferative DR (NPDR), 25 with moderate NPDR, 34 with severe NPDR, 17 with
proliferative DR. Methods: In this study, 3x3-mm optical coherence tomography
(OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) scans with a 400x400 sampling density from one
eye of each participant were obtained using a commercial OCT system. Trained
graders manually identified MAs and their location relative to the anatomic
layers from cross-sectional OCT. Microaneurysms were first classified as active
if the flow signal was present in the OCTA channel. Then active MAs were
further classified into fully active and partially active MAs based on the flow
perfusion status of MA on en face OCTA. The presence of retinal fluid near MAs
was compared between active and inactive types. We also compared OCT-based MA
detection to fundus photography (FP) and fluorescein angiography (FA)-based
detection. Results: We identified 308 MAs (166 fully active, 88 partially
active, 54 inactive) in 42 eyes using OCT and OCTA. Nearly half of the MAs
identified straddle the inner nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer. Compared
to partially active and inactive MAs, fully active MAs were more likely to be
associated with local retinal fluid. The associated fluid volumes were larger
with fully active MAs than with partially active and inactive MAs. OCT/OCTA
detected all MAs found on FP. While not all MAs seen with FA were identified
with OCT, some MAs seen with OCT were not visible with FA or FP. Conclusions:
Co-registered OCT and OCTA can characterize MA activities, which could be a new
means to study diabetic macular edema pathophysiology.

the shape of a surface is determined by measuring how curved it is at each
point. From these measurements, one can identify the directions of largest and
smallest curvature, i.e. the principal curvatures, and construct two surface
invariants by taking the average and the product of the principal curvatures.
The product of the principal curvatures describes the intrinsic curvature of a
surface, and has profound importance in differential geometry - evidenced by
the Gauss's Theorema Egregium and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. This curvature is
commonly referred to as the Gaussian Curvature after Carl Friedrich Gauss,
following his significant contributions to the emerging field of differential
geometry in his 1828 work. The average, or mean curvature, is an extrinsic
measure of the shape of a surface - that is, the shape must be embedded in a
higher dimensional space to be measured. Beginning in 1811, and culminating in
efforts in 1821 and 1826, the mathematician Sophie Germain identified the mean
curvature as the appropriate measure for describing the shape of vibrating
plates. Her hypothesis leads directly to the equations describing the behavior
of thin, elastic plates. In letters to Gauss, she described her notion of a
""sphere of mean curvature"" that can be identified at each point on the surface.
This contribution stimulated a period of rapid development in elasticity and
geometry, and yet Germain has not yet received due credit for deducing the
mathematical and physical significance of mean curvature. It is clear from the
primary source evidence that this measure of mean curvature should bear the
name of Sophie Germain.

Symmetry estimation is carried out using hypothesis testing for invariance

subgroup lattice when G_max is a compact subgroup of G, even for infinite

applying the Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) approach to large real-world data.
Approximate Bayesian inference via optimization of the variational evidence
lower bound, often called Variational Bayes (VB), has been successfully
demonstrated for other applications. We investigate the performance and
characteristics of currently available R and Python VB software for variational
Bayesian Latent Class Analysis (LCA) of realistically large real-world
observational data. We used a real-world data set, Optum\textsuperscript{TM}
electronic health records (EHR), containing pediatric patients with risk
indicators for type 2 diabetes mellitus that is a rare form in pediatric
patients. The aim of this work is to validate a Bayesian patient phenotyping
model for generality and extensibility and crucially that it can be applied to
a realistically large real-world clinical data set. We find currently available
automatic VB methods are very sensitive to initial starting conditions, model
definition, algorithm hyperparameters and choice of gradient optimiser. The
Bayesian LCA model was challenging to implement using VB but we achieved
reasonable results with very good computational performance compared to MCMC.

well as an environment for optimizing event generators with numerous
applications in high energy particle and nuclear physics. Looking at
electron-proton collisions is of particular interest as many of the
complications present at hadron colliders are absent. A detailed study of
modern jet substructure observables, jet angularities, in electron-proton
collisions is presented using data recorded using the H1 detector at HERA. The
measurement is unbinned and multi-dimensional, using machine learning to
correct for detector effects. All of the available reconstructed object
information of the respective jets is interpreted by a graph neural network,
achieving superior precision on a selected set of jet angularities. Training
these networks was enabled by the use of a large number of GPUs in the
Perlmutter supercomputer at Berkeley Lab. The particle jets are reconstructed
in the laboratory frame, using the $k_{\mathrm{T}}$ jet clustering algorithm.
Results are reported at high transverse momentum transfer $Q^2>150$ GeV${}^2$,
and inelasticity $0.2 < y < 0.7$. The analysis is also performed in sub-regions
of $Q^2$, thus probing scale dependencies of the substructure variables. The
data are compared with a variety of predictions and point towards possible
improvements of such models.

rate of neutrino absorption on a gallium target was observed, consistent with
earlier results from neutrino source calibrations of the SAGE and GALLEX/GNO
solar neutrino experiments. The BEST collaboration, utilizing a 3.4 MCi 51Cr
neutrino source, found observed-to-expected counting rates at two very short
baselines of R=0.791 plus/minus 0.05 and 0.766 plus/minus 0.05, respectively.
Among recent neutrino experiments, BEST is notable for the simplicity of both
its neutrino spectrum, line neutrinos from an electron-capture source whose
intensity can be measured to a estimated precision of 0.23%, and its absorption
cross section, where the precisely known rate of electron capture to the
gallium ground state, 71Ge(e,nue)71Ga(g.s.), establishes a minimum value.
However, the absorption cross section uncertainty is a common systematic in the
BEST, SAGE, and GALLEX/GNO neutrino source experiments. Here we update that
cross section, considering a variety of electroweak corrections and the role of
transitions to excited states, to establish both a central value and reasonable
uncertainty, thereby enabling a more accurate assessment of the statistical
significance of the gallium anomalies. Results are given for 51Cr and 37Ar
sources. The revised neutrino capture rates are used in a re-evaluation of the
BEST and gallium anomalies.

ability to turn the network nodes that they compromise into additional
attackers, leading to the spread of high volume attacks over long periods. The
detection of such Botnets is complicated by the fact that multiple network IP
addresses will be simultaneously compromised, so that Collective Classification
of compromised nodes, in addition to the already available traditional methods
that focus on individual nodes, can be useful. Thus this work introduces a
collective Botnet attack classification technique that operates on traffic from
an n-node IP network with a novel Associated Random Neural Network (ARNN) that
identifies the nodes which are compromised. The ARNN is a recurrent
architecture that incorporates two mutually associated, interconnected and
architecturally identical n-neuron random neural networks, that act
simultneously as mutual critics to reach the decision regarding which of n
nodes have been compromised. A novel gradient learning descent algorithm is
presented for the ARNN, and is shown to operate effectively both with
conventional off-line training from prior data, and with on-line incremental
training without prior off-line learning. Real data from a 107 node packet
network is used with over 700,000 packets to evaluate the ARNN, showing that it
provides accurate predictions. Comparisons with other well-known state of the
art methods using the same learning and testing datasets, show that the ARNN
offers significantly better performance.

We use template parameters, here within the Intel oneAPI tool flow, to create
customized designs for 256 different ERI quartet classes, based on their
orbitals. To maximize data reuse, all intermediates are buffered in FPGA
on-chip memory with customized layout. The pre-calculation of intermediates
also helps to overcome data dependencies caused by multi-dimensional recurrence
relations. The involved loop structures are partially or even fully unrolled
for high throughput of FPGA kernels. Furthermore, a lossy compression algorithm
utilizing arbitrary bitwidth integers is integrated in the FPGA kernels. To our

supports more than just the single most basic quartet class. Also, the
integration of ERI computation and compression it a novelty that is not even

In this work, we aim to explore HR estimation techniques that are more suitable
for lower-power and resource-constrained embedded devices. More specifically,
we seek to design techniques that could provide high-accuracy HR estimation
with low-frequency PPG sampling, small model size, and fast inference time.
First, we show that by combining signal processing and ML, it is possible to
reduce the PPG sampling frequency from 125 Hz to only 25 Hz while providing
higher HR estimation accuracy. This combination also helps to reduce the ML
model feature size, leading to smaller models. Additionally, we present a
comprehensive analysis on different ML models and feature sizes to compare
their accuracy, model size, and inference time. The models explored include
Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support
vector machines (SVM), and Multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Experiments were
conducted using both a widely-utilized dataset and our self-collected dataset.
The experimental results show that our method by combining signal processing

Recent research has demonstrated that photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors can be

only employed signal processing or machine learning (ML), or because they
indirectly inferred HRV, or because there lacks large training datasets. Many
prior studies may also require large ML models. The low accuracy and large
model sizes limit their applications to small embedded devices and potential
future use in healthcare. To address the above issues, we first collected a
large dataset of PPG signals and HRV ground truth. With this dataset, we
developed HRV models that combine signal processing and ML to directly infer
HRV. Evaluation results show that our method had errors between 3.5% to 25.7%

different ML models, which showed that Decision Trees and Multi-level

the A* search algorithm. It is controlled by a delete relaxation-based domain

and exit tear size on the hemodynamics in type B aortic dissection by comparing
fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations with in vitro 4D-flow magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). A baseline patient-specific 3D-printed model and two
variants with modified tear size (smaller entry tear, smaller exit tear) were
embedded into a flow- and pressure-controlled setup to perform MRI as well as
12-point catheter-based pressure measurements. The same models defined the wall
and fluid domains for FSI simulations, for which boundary conditions were
matched with measured data. Results showed exceptionally well matched complex
flow patterns between 4D-flow MRI and FSI simulations. Compared to the baseline
model, false lumen flow volume decreased with either a smaller entry tear
(-17.8 and -18.5 %, for FSI simulation and 4D-flow MRI, respectively) or
smaller exit tear (-16.0 and -17.3 %). True to false lumen pressure difference
(initially 11.0 and 7.9 mmHg, for FSI simulation and catheter-based pressure
measurements, respectively) increased with a smaller entry tear (28.9 and 14.6
mmHg), and became negative with a smaller exit tear (-20.6 and -13.2 mmHg).
This work establishes quantitative and qualitative effects of entry or exit
tear size on hemodynamics in aortic dissection, with particularly notable
impact observed on FL pressurization. FSI simulations demonstrate acceptable
qualitative and quantitative agreement with flow imaging, supporting its
deployment in clinical studies.

novel broad class of streaming instabilities, termed resonant drag
instabilities (RDIs), can be attributed to a particular resonance phenomenon
caused by defective eigenvalues of the linearized dust/fluid system. In this
work, it is demonstrated that this resonance phenomenon is not unique to RDIs
and can be used as a framework to understand a wider range of instabilities,
termed resonant instabilities. Particular attention is given to the filamentary
ionization instability seen in laboratory dusty plasmas and to the two-stream
instability. It is shown that, due to the commonalities in underlying physics
between the dust-ion-acoustic two-stream instability and the acoustic RDI,
these instabilities should be relevant in strongly overlapping regimes in
astrophysical dusty plasmas. It is proposed that a similar overlap in the
experimental accessibility of these modes (and of the filamentary instability)
allows for the possibility of experimental investigation of complex and

find hate communities within Reddit, and then augment 11 subreddits extracted
with 14 known hateful subreddits (25 in total). Using causal inference methods,
we evaluate the effect of replies on engagement in hateful subreddits by
comparing users who receive replies to their first comment (the treatment) to
equivalent control users who do not. We find users who receive replies are less
likely to become engaged in hateful subreddits than users who do not, while the
opposite effect is observed for a matched sample of similar-sized non-hateful
subreddits. Using the Google Perspective API and VADER, we discover that
hateful community first-repliers are more toxic, negative, and attack the
posters more often than non-hateful first-repliers. In addition, we uncover a
negative correlation between engagement and attacks or toxicity of
first-repliers. We simulate the cumulative engagement of hateful and
non-hateful subreddits under the contra-positive scenario of friendly
first-replies, finding that attacks dramatically reduce engagement in hateful
subreddits. These results counter-intuitively imply that, although
under-moderated communities allow hate to fester, the resulting environment is
such that direct social interaction does not encourage further participation,

approximation to the gradient of the data likelihood with respect to all
unknown substitution model parameters. We demonstrate that this approximate
gradient enables scaling of both sampling-based (Bayesian inference via HMC)
and maximization-based inference (MAP estimation) under random-effects
substitution models across large trees and state-spaces. Applied to a dataset
of 583 SARS-CoV-2 sequences, an HKY model with random-effects shows strong
signals of nonreversibility in the substitution process, and posterior
predictive model checks clearly show that it is more adequate than a reversible

have shown results mainly on motion capture (MoCap) environments, not on

the wild is extremely challenging, even for the 2D data. We present InterWild,
which brings MoCap and ITW samples to shared domains for robust 3D interacting
hands recovery in the wild with a limited amount of ITW 2D/3D interacting hands
data. 3D interacting hands recovery consists of two sub-problems: 1) 3D
recovery of each hand and 2) 3D relative translation recovery between two
hands. For the first sub-problem, we bring MoCap and ITW samples to a shared 2D
scale space. Although ITW datasets provide a limited amount of 2D/3D
interacting hands, they contain large-scale 2D single hand data. Motivated by
this, we use a single hand image as an input for the first sub-problem
regardless of whether two hands are interacting. Hence, interacting hands of
MoCap datasets are brought to the 2D scale space of single hands of ITW
datasets. For the second sub-problem, we bring MoCap and ITW samples to a
shared appearance-invariant space. Unlike the first sub-problem, 2D labels of
ITW datasets are not helpful for the second sub-problem due to the 3D
translation's ambiguity. Hence, instead of relying on ITW samples, we amplify
the generalizability of MoCap samples by taking only a geometric feature
without an image as an input for the second sub-problem. As the geometric
feature is invariant to appearances, MoCap and ITW samples do not suffer from a
huge appearance gap between the two datasets. The code is publicly available at

areas including SLAM systems. Current neural SLAM or online mapping systems
lead to impressive results in the presence of simple captures, but they rely on
a world-centric map representation as only a single neural field model is used.
To define such a world-centric representation, accurate and static prior
information about the scene, such as its boundaries and initial camera poses,
are required. However, in real-time and on-the-fly scene capture applications,
this prior knowledge cannot be assumed as fixed or static, since it dynamically

observations. Particularly in the context of large-scale mapping, significant
camera pose drift is inevitable, necessitating the correction via loop closure.
To overcome this limitation, we propose NEWTON, a view-centric mapping method

contrast to prior works, our method enables camera pose updates using loop
closures and scene boundary updates by representing the scene with multiple
neural fields, where each is defined in a local coordinate system of a selected

typically relies on the representation of the return distribution, which needs
to be carefully designed. In this paper, we address this challenge for a
special class of DRL problems that rely on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for
control, advocating for a new distributional approach to LQR, which we call
\emph{distributional LQR}. Specifically, we provide a closed-form expression of
the distribution of the random return which, remarkably, is applicable to all
exogenous disturbances on the dynamics, as long as they are independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.). While the proposed exact return distribution
consists of infinitely many random variables, we show that this distribution
can be approximated by a finite number of random variables, and the associated

a Marangoni type of effect, while the wetting energy resulting from
fluid--solid interaction between the film and the substrate is described by a
concentration dependent Hamaker constant. The linear stability analysis
uncovers that both monotonous and oscillatory evolution is possible. While our

on domain gaps, such as image resolution, blurriness and sensor variations.
Most prior works regard domain-specific signals as a negative impact, and apply
metric learning or adversarial losses to remove them from feature
representation. Though learning a domain-invariant feature space is viable for
the training data, we show that the feature shift still exists in an unseen
test domain, which backfires on the generalizability of the classifier. In this
work, instead of constructing a domain-invariant feature space, we encourage
domain separability while aligning the live-to-spoof transition (i.e., the
trajectory from live to spoof) to be the same for all domains. We formulate
this FAS strategy of separability and alignment (SA-FAS) as a problem of
invariant risk minimization (IRM), and learn domain-variant feature
representation but domain-invariant classifier. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of SA-FAS on challenging cross-domain FAS datasets and establish
state-of-the-art performance.

IceCube's DeepCore data has been used to test dark matter masses ranging from
10~GeV to 40~TeV. No significant neutrino excess was found and upper limits on
the annihilation cross section, as well as lower limits on the dark matter
lifetime, were set. The limits reached are of the order of $10^{-24}$~cm$^3/s$
for an annihilation and up to $10^{27}$ seconds for decaying Dark Matter. Using
the same data sample we also derive limits for dark matter annihilation or
decay into a pair of Standard Model charged particles.

balanced datasets, e.g. ImageNet, despite the fact that natural data usually
exhibits long-tail distributions. In this paper, we analyse the behaviour of
one of the most popular variants of SSL, i.e. contrastive methods, on long-tail
data. In particular, we investigate the role of the temperature parameter
$\tau$ in the contrastive loss, by analysing the loss through the lens of
average distance maximisation, and find that a large $\tau$ emphasises
group-wise discrimination, whereas a small $\tau$ leads to a higher degree of
instance discrimination. While $\tau$ has thus far been treated exclusively as
a constant hyperparameter, in this work, we propose to employ a dynamic $\tau$
and show that a simple cosine schedule can yield significant improvements in
the learnt representations. Such a schedule results in a constant `task
switching' between an emphasis on instance discrimination and group-wise
discrimination and thereby ensures that the model learns both group-wise
features, as well as instance-specific details. Since frequent classes benefit
from the former, while infrequent classes require the latter, we find this
method to consistently improve separation between the classes in long-tail data
without any additional computational cost.

distributions that are difficult to sample from using Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods. Traditional MCMC algorithms often face slow convergence due to
the difficulty in finding proposals that suit the problem at hand. To address
this issue, the paper introduces the Approximate Posterior Ensemble Sampler
(APES) algorithm, which employs kernel density estimation and radial basis
interpolation to create an adaptive proposal, leading to fast convergence of
the chains. The APES algorithm's scalability to higher dimensions makes it a
practical solution for complex problems. The proposed method generates an
approximate posterior probability that closely approximates the desired
distribution and is easy to sample from, resulting in smaller autocorrelation
times and a higher probability of acceptance by the chain. In this work, we
compare the performance of the APES algorithm with the affine invariance
ensemble sampler with the stretch move in various contexts, demonstrating the
efficiency of the proposed method. For instance, on the Rosenbrock function,
the APES presented an autocorrelation time 140 times smaller than the affine
invariance ensemble sampler. The comparison showcases the effectiveness of the
APES algorithm in generating samples from challenging distributions. This paper
presents a practical solution to generating samples from complex distributions
while addressing the challenge of finding suitable proposals. With new
cosmological surveys set to deal with many new systematics, which will require
many new nuisance parameters in the models, this method offers a practical
solution for the upcoming era of cosmological analyses.

systems transformation and their contributions to global goals. In 2021, the
Food Systems Countdown to 2030 Initiative (FSCI) articulated an architecture to
monitor food systems across five themes: 1 diets, nutrition, and health; 2
environment, natural resources, and production; 3 livelihoods, poverty, and
equity; 4 governance; and 5 resilience and sustainability. Each theme comprises
three-to-five indicator domains. This paper builds on that architecture,
presenting the inclusive, consultative process used to select indicators and an
application of the indicator framework using the latest available data,
constructing the first global food systems baseline to track transformation.
While data are available to cover most themes and domains, critical indicator
gaps exist such as off-farm livelihoods, food loss and waste, and governance.
Baseline results demonstrate every region or country can claim positive
outcomes in some parts of food systems, but none are optimal across all
domains, and some indicators are independent of national income. These results
underscore the need for dedicated monitoring and transformation agendas
specific to food systems. Tracking these indicators to 2030 and beyond will
allow for data-driven food systems governance at all scales and increase
accountability for urgently needed progress toward achieving global goals.

with supercapacitors. In contrast to energy storage, which can be maximised by
ionophobic pores, such pores do not yield the best heat-to-electricity

provide unique insights into how that galaxy assembled its stellar mass over
its lifetime. Previous work at ~1 kpc resolution has already revealed common
features in the mass buildup (e.g., inside-out growth of galaxies). However,
even at approximate kpc scales, the stellar populations are blurred between the
different galactic morphological structures such as spiral arms, bars and
bulges. Here we present a detailed analysis of the spatially resolved star
formation histories (SFHs) of 19 PHANGS-MUSE galaxies, at a spatial resolution
of ~100 pc. We show that our sample of local galaxies exhibits predominantly
negative radial gradients of stellar age and [Z/H], consistent with previous
findings, and a radial structure that is primarily consistent with local star
formation, and indicative of inside-out formation. In barred galaxies, we find
flatter [Z/H] gradients along the semi-major axis of the bar than along the
semi-minor axis, as is expected from the radial mixing of material along the
bar. In general, the derived assembly histories of the galaxies in our sample
tell a consistent story of inside-out growth, where low-mass galaxies assembled
the majority of their stellar mass later in cosmic history than high-mass
galaxies. We also show how stellar populations of different ages exhibit
different kinematics, with younger stellar populations having lower velocity
dispersions than older stellar populations at similar galactocentric distances,
which we interpret as an imprint of the progressive dynamical heating of
stellar populations as they age. Finally, we explore how the time-averaged star
formation rate evolves with time, and how it varies across galactic disks. This
analysis reveals a wide variation of the SFHs of galaxy centers and
additionally shows that structural features become less pronounced with age.

to address the problem of searching efficient architectures for devices with
different resources constraints by decoupling the training and the searching

network is done only once, and then it is possible to perform multiple searches
for subnetworks extracted from this trained network according to each
deployment scenario. In this work we aim to give one step further in the search
for efficiency by explicitly conceiving the search stage as a multi-objective
optimization problem. A Pareto frontier is then populated with efficient, and
already trained, neural architectures exhibiting distinct trade-offs among the
conflicting objectives. This could be achieved by using any multi-objective
evolutionary algorithm during the search stage, such as NSGA-II and SMS-EMOA.
In other words, the neural network is trained once, the searching for

time, and then the user can choose a suitable neural network according to each

multi-objective optimization opens the possibility of a posteriori
decision-making in NAS, after sampling efficient subnetworks which are a very
good approximation of the Pareto frontier, given that those subnetworks are
already trained and ready to use. The source code and the final search

performance of deep-learning-based speech enhancement algorithms. These
objective functions, however, do not always strongly correlate with a
listener's assessment of perceptual quality, so optimizing with these measures
often results in poorer performance in real-world scenarios. In this work, we
propose an attention-based enhancement approach that uses learned speech
embedding vectors from a mean-opinion score (MOS) prediction model and a speech
enhancement module to jointly enhance noisy speech. The MOS prediction model
estimates the perceptual MOS of speech quality, as assessed by human listeners,
directly from the audio signal. The enhancement module also employs a quantized
language model that enforces spectral constraints for better speech realism and
performance. We train the model using real-world noisy speech data that has
been captured in everyday environments and test it using unseen corpora. The
results show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms other
approaches that are optimized with objective measures, where the predicted
quality scores strongly correlate with human judgments.

categorical description of a scene contains the names of individual objects but
lacks information about other attributes. Here, we use distributed

high-dimensional vector. To control the scene composition, we use artificial
images composed of multiple, translated and colored MNIST digits. In contrast
to learning category labels, here we train deep neural networks to output the
full compositional vector description of an input image. The output of the deep
network can then be interpreted by a VSA resonator network, to extract object
identity or other properties of indiviual objects. We evaluate the performance
and generalization properties of the system on randomly generated scenes.
Specifically, we show that the network is able to learn the task and generalize
to unseen seen digit shapes and scene configurations. Further, the
generalisation ability of the trained model is limited. For example, with a gap
in the training data, like an object not shown in a particular image location

in the Solar System. Although typical cometary activity tracers were not
detected, `Oumuamua exhibited a significant non-gravitational acceleration. To
date there is no explanation that can reconcile these constraints. Due to
energetic considerations, outgassing of hyper-volatile molecules is favored
over heavier volatiles like H2O and CO2. However, there are are theoretical
and/or observational inconsistencies with existing models invoking the
sublimation of pure H2 , N2, and CO. Non-outgassing explanations require
fine-tuned formation mechanisms and/or unrealistic progenitor production rates.
Here we report that the acceleration of `Oumuamua is due to the release of
entrapped molecular hydrogen which formed through energetic processing of an
H2O-rich icy body. In this model, `Oumuamua began as an icy planetesimal that
was irradiated at low temperatures by cosmic rays during its interstellar
journey, and experienced warming during its passage through the Solar System.
This explanation is supported by a large body of experimental work showing that
H2 is efficiently and generically produced from H2O ice processing, and that
the entrapped H2 is released over a broad range of temperatures during
annealing of the amorphous water matrix. We show that this mechanism can
explain many of `Oumuamua's peculiar properties without fine-tuning. This
provides further support that `Oumuamua originated as a planetesimal relic
broadly similar to Solar System comets.

  Journal Supplement Series",,"10.3847/1538-4365/acc796",,"astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The observed solar oscillation spectrum is influenced by internal
perturbations such as flows and structural asphericities. These features induce
splitting of characteristic frequencies and distort the resonant-mode
eigenfunctions. Global axisymmertric flow -- differential rotation -- is a very
prominent perturbation. Tightly constrained rotation profiles as a function of
latitude and radius are products of established helioseismic pipelines that use
observed Dopplergrams to generate frequency-splitting measurements at high
precision. However, the inference of rotation using frequency-splittings do not
consider the effect of mode-coupling. This approximation worsens for
high-angular-degree modes, as they become increasingly proximal in frequency.
Since modes with high angular degrees probe the near-surface layers of the Sun,
inversions considering coupled modes could potentially lead to more accurate
estimates of rotation very close to the surface. In order to investigate if
this is indeed the case, we perform inversions for solar differential rotation,
considering coupling of modes for angular degrees $160 \leq \ell \leq 300$ in
the surface gravity $f$-branch and first-overtone $p$ modes. In keeping with
the character of mode coupling, we carry out a non-linear inversion using an
eigenvalue solver. Differences in inverted profiles for frequency splitting
measurements from MDI and HMI are compared and discussed. We find that
corrections to the near-surface differential rotation profile, when accounting
for mode-coupling effects, are smaller than 0.003 nHz and hence are
insignificant. These minuscule corrections are found to be correlated with the
solar cycle. We also present corrections to even-order splitting coefficients,
which could consequently impact inversions for structure and magnetic fields.

couples to local phonon degrees of freedom. In the single site limit, at
half-filling, the electron-phonon coupling results in a double well structure
for the lattice displacement, favoring empty or doubly occupied sites. In two
dimensions, and on a bipartite lattice in $d \geq 2$, an intersite hopping
causes these doubly occupied and empty sites to alternate in a charge density
wave (CDW) pattern when the temperature is lowered. Because a discrete symmetry
is broken, this occurs in a conventional second-order transition at finite
$T_{\rm cdw}$. In this paper, we investigate the effect of changing the phonon
potential energy to one with an intrinsic double well structure even in the
absence of an electron-phonon coupling. While this aids in the initial process
of pair formation, the implications for subsequent CDW order are non-trivial.
One expects that, when the electron-phonon coupling is too strong, the double
wells become deep and the polaron mass large, an effect which reduces $T_{\rm

double well potential, while aiding local pair formation, does so in a way
which also substantially enhances long range CDW order.

To address this problem, we propose a novel method called Low-frequency Image
Deep Steganography (LIDS) that allows frequency distribution manipulation in
the embedding process. LIDS extracts a feature map from the secret image and
adds it to the cover image to yield the container image. The container image is
not directly output by the CNNs, and thus, it does not contain high-frequency
artifacts. The extracted feature map is regulated by a frequency loss to ensure
that its frequency distribution mainly concentrates on the low-frequency
domain. To further enhance robustness, an attack layer is inserted to damage
the container image. The retrieval network then retrieves a recovered secret
image from a damaged container image. Our experiments demonstrate that LIDS
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness, while maintaining
high fidelity and specificity. By avoiding high-frequency artifacts and
manipulating the frequency distribution of the embedded feature map, LIDS
achieves improved robustness against attacks that distort the high-frequency

similar conclusions, but we observe this format is not semantically equivalent;
it is incapable of accurately representing some COGS meanings. These findings

vector mass term $\eta X$ ($\eta$ is a constant). Under an expansion of the
small coupling constant $\alpha$ with $\eta \neq 0$, we derive hairy black hole
solutions endowed with nonvanishing temporal and radial vector field profiles.
The asymptotic properties of solutions around the horizon and at spatial
infinity are different from those of hairy black holes present in scalar-GB
theories. We also show that black hole solutions without the vector mass term,
i.e., $\eta=0$, are prone to ghost instability of odd-parity perturbations.

May 1, as it went into outburst from a quiescent state. As the source rose in
flux it showed periodic absorption dips and fit the timing and spectral
characteristics of a hard state accreting black hole. We report on the results
of a Target-of-Opportunity observation with NuSTAR obtained near the peak
outburst flux beginning on 2021 May 13, after the source had transitioned into
an intermediate state. MAXI J1803-298 is variable across the observation, which
we investigate by extracting spectral and timing products separately for
different levels of flux throughout the observation. Our timing analysis
reveals two distinct potential QPOs which are not harmonically related at
5.4+/-0.2 Hz and 9.4+/-0.3 Hz, present only during periods of lower flux. With
clear relativistic reflection signatures detected in the source spectrum, we
applied several different reflection models to the spectra of MAXI J1803-298.
Here we report our results, utilizing high density reflection models to
constrain the disk geometry, and assess changes in the spectrum dependent on
the source flux. With a standard broken power-law emissivity, we find a
near-maximal spin for the black hole, and we are able to constrain the
inclination of the accretion disk at 75+/-2 degrees, which is expected for a
source that has shown periodic absorption dips. We also significantly detect a
narrow absorption feature at 6.91+/-0.06 keV with an equivalent width between 4
and 9 eV, which we interpret as the signature of a disk wind.

next generation of extremely large telescopes. This is very challenging due to
the star-planet contrast that must be overcome. Most current high-contrast
imaging instruments are limited in sensitivity at small angular separations due
to non-common path aberrations (NCPA). The NCPA leak through the coronagraph
and create bright speckles that limit the on-sky contrast and therefore also
the post-processed contrast. We aim to remove the NCPA by active focal plane
wavefront control using a data-driven approach. We developed a new approach to
dark hole creation and maintenance that does not require an instrument model.
This new approach is called implicit Electric Field Conjugation (iEFC) and it
can be empirically calibrated. This makes it robust for complex instruments
where optical models might be difficult to realize. Numerical simulations have
been used to explore the performance of iEFC for different coronagraphs. The
method was validated on the internal source of the Magellan Adaptive Optics
eXtreme (MagAO-X) instrument to demonstrate iEFC's performance on a real
instrument. Numerical experiments demonstrate that iEFC can achieve deep
contrast below $10^{-9}$ with several coronagraphs. The method is easily
extended to broadband measurements and the simulations show that a bandwidth up
to 40% can be handled without problems. Experiments with MagAO-X showed a
contrast gain of a factor 10 in a broadband light and a factor 20 to 200 in
narrowband light. A contrast of $5\cdot10^{-8}$ was achieved with the Phase
Apodized Pupil Lyot Coronagraph at 7.5 $\lambda/D$. The new iEFC method has
been demonstrated to work in numerical and lab experiments. It is a method that
can be empirically calibrated and it can achieve deep contrast. This makes it a
valuable approach for complex ground-based high-contrast imaging systems.

such that every string is mutually linked with all the other strings.
Interestingly, despite being an unconventional topological structure, a

learned? In this work, we answer these questions through a visual analytics
approach. Specifically, we first identify what heads are more important in ViTs
by introducing multiple pruning-based metrics. Then, we profile the spatial

immutable and transparent agreements without the involvement of intermediaries.
Despite the growing popularity of smart contracts for many blockchain platforms
like Ethereum, smart contract developers cannot prevent copying their smart
contracts from competitors due to the absence of technical means available.
However, applying existing software watermarking techniques is challenging
because of the unique properties of smart contracts, such as a code size
constraint, non-free execution cost, and no support for dynamic allocation
under a virtual machine environment. This paper introduces a novel software
watermarking scheme, dubbed SmartMark, aiming to protect the piracy of smart
contracts. SmartMark builds the control flow graph of a target contract runtime
bytecode and locates a series of bytes randomly selected from a collection of
opcodes to represent a watermark. We implement a full-fledged prototype for
Ethereum, applying SmartMark to 27,824 unique smart contract bytecodes. Our
empirical results demonstrate that SmartMark can effectively embed a watermark
into smart contracts and verify its presence, meeting the requirements of
credibility and imperceptibility while incurring a slight performance
degradation. Furthermore, our security analysis shows that SmartMark is
resilient against foreseeable watermarking corruption attacks; e.g., a large
number of dummy opcodes are needed to disable a watermark effectively,
resulting in producing illegitimate smart contract clones that are not
economical.

(1) an unsupervised learning stage to train a latent flow auto-encoder for
spatial content generation, including a flow predictor to estimate latent flow
between pairs of video frames, and (2) a conditional learning stage to train a
3D-UNet-based diffusion model (DM) for temporal latent flow generation. Unlike
previous DMs operating in pixel space or latent feature space that couples
spatial and temporal information, the DM in our LFDM only needs to learn a

allowing one to encode such an initial state: the reverse annealing and the
h-gain features. Reverse annealing (RA) aims to refine a known solution
following an anneal path starting with a classical state representing a good

then finishing the annealing process with a forward anneal. The h-gain (HG)
feature allows one to put a time-dependent weighting scheme on linear ($h$)
biases of the Hamiltonian, and we demonstrate that this feature likewise can be
used to bias the annealing to start from an initial state. We also consider a
hybrid method consisting of a backward phase resembling RA, and a forward phase
using the HG initial state encoding. Importantly, we investigate the idea of
iteratively applying RA and HG to a problem, with the goal of monotonically
improving on an initial state that is not optimal. The HG encoding technique is
evaluated on a variety of input problems including the weighted Maximum Cut

technique is a viable alternative to RA for some problems. We also investigate

(hcp-Ni) metastable phase during spontaneous crystallization is studied using
non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with the goal of
maximizing the fraction of this metastable phase in the final state. We employ
Bayesian Optimization (BO) with the Gaussian Processes (GP) regression as the
surrogate model to maximize the hcp-Ni phase fraction, where temperature and
pressure are control variables. MD simulations provide data for training the GP
model, which is then used with BO to predict the next simulation condition.
Such a BO-guided active learning leads to a maximum hcp-Ni fraction of 43.38%
in the final crystalized phase within 40 iterations when a face-centered cubic
(fcc) crystallite serves as the seed for crystallization from the amorphous
phase. When an hcp seed is used, the maximum hcp-Ni fraction in the final

tokens to accelerate the ViT's multi-head self-attention (MHSA) operations.
However, such structured attention patterns limit the token-to-token
connections to their spatial relevance, which disregards learned semantic
connections from a full attention mask. In this work, we propose a novel
approach to learn instance-dependent attention patterns, by devising a
lightweight connectivity predictor module to estimate the connectivity score of
each pair of tokens. Intuitively, two tokens have high connectivity scores if
the features are considered relevant either spatially or semantically. As each
token only attends to a small number of other tokens, the binarized
connectivity masks are often very sparse by nature and therefore provide the
opportunity to accelerate the network via sparse computations. Equipped with
the learned unstructured attention pattern, sparse attention ViT (Sparsifiner)
produces a superior Pareto-optimal trade-off between FLOPs and top-1 accuracy
on ImageNet compared to token sparsity. Our method reduces 48% to 69% FLOPs of

paper proposes a selective graph augmentation method (SAug) to solve this
problem. Firstly, a Pagerank-based sampling strategy is designed to identify
hub nodes and tail nodes in the graph. Secondly, a selective augmentation
strategy is proposed, which drops the noisy neighbors of hub nodes on one side,
and discovers the latent neighbors and generates pseudo neighbors for tail
nodes on the other side. It can also alleviate the structural imbalance between
two types of nodes. Finally, a GNN model will be retrained on the augmented
graph. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAug can significantly improve
the backbone GNNs and achieve superior performance to its competitors of graph
augmentation methods and hub/tail aware methods.

to support massive Internet of Things (IoT) connections. Two multiple access
schemes are proposed in this paper to facilitate the massive IoT connections
using the cellular network based on the SR technique, namely, the simultaneous
access (SA) scheme and the selection diversity access (SDA) scheme. In the SA
scheme, the base station (BS) transmits information to the receiver while
multiple IoT devices transmit their information simultaneously by passively
backscattering the BS signal to the receiver, while in the SDA scheme, only the
IoT device with the strongest backscatter link transmits information to the
receiver. In both of the schemes, the receiver jointly decodes the information
from the BS and the IoT devices. To evaluate the above two schemes, in this
paper, we have derived the closed-form expressions of the ergodic rates and the
outage probabilities for the cellular and IoT transmissions. Finally, numerical
results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis and compare the two
proposed multiple access schemes. When the number of IoT devices is small, the
SDA scheme is more appealing since it can significantly reduce the
computational complexity while achieving equivalent performance to the SA
scheme. When the number of IoT devices is large, the SA scheme is preferable
since it guarantees a significantly better rate performance and a lower outage
probability.

degradation under adverse weather. Although semi/full-supervised methods have
made good attempts, the domain shift between the synthetic and real adverse
weather images would deteriorate their performance. To alleviate this issue,
our start point is to unsupervisedly transfer the knowledge from source clean
domain to target degraded domain. Our key insight is that adverse weather does
not change the intrinsic optical flow of the scene, but causes a significant
difference for the warp error between clean and degraded images. In this work,
we propose the first unsupervised framework for adverse weather optical flow
via hierarchical motion-boundary adaptation. Specifically, we first employ
image translation to construct the transformation relationship between clean
and degraded domains. In motion adaptation, we utilize the flow consistency
knowledge to align the cross-domain optical flows into a motion-invariance
common space, where the optical flow from clean weather is used as the
guidance-knowledge to obtain a preliminary optical flow for adverse weather.
Furthermore, we leverage the warp error inconsistency which measures the motion
misalignment of the boundary between the clean and degraded domains, and
propose a joint intra- and inter-scene boundary contrastive adaptation to
refine the motion boundary. The hierarchical motion and boundary adaptation
jointly promotes optical flow in a unified framework. Extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments have been performed to verify the superiority of
the proposed method.

that uses geometry information as an auxiliary input and graph convolution
blocks to extract local features efficiently. Specifically, we use a
parallel-serial graph attention module with a multi-head graph attention

Additionally, we design a feature refinement module that takes into account the

3D patches, which are sent to GQE-Net for quality enhancement. To account for

spatial discretization of a class of semi-linear stochastic partial

SPDEs is only assumed to satisfy a one-sided Lipschitz condition and the
diffusion term is assumed to be globally Lipschitz continuous. Our new strategy
for time discretization is based on the Milstein method from stochastic
differential equations. We use the energy method for its error analysis and
show a strong convergence order of nearly $1$ for the approximate solution. The
proof is based on new H\""older continuity estimates of the SPDE solution and
the nonlinear term. For the general polynomial-type drift term, there are
difficulties in deriving even the stability of the numerical solutions. We
propose an interpolation-based finite element method for spatial discretization
to overcome the difficulties. Then we obtain $H^1$ stability, higher moment
$H^1$ stability, $L^2$ stability, and higher moment $L^2$ stability results

representing the spatial-temporal information of events when guiding VSR. To
this end, we propose a novel framework that incorporates the spatial-temporal
interpolation of events to VSR in a unified framework. Our key idea is to learn
implicit neural representations from queried spatial-temporal coordinates and
features from both RGB frames and events. Our method contains three parts.
Specifically, the Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) module first learns the 3D
features from events and RGB frames. Then, the Temporal Filter (TF) module
unlocks more explicit motion information from the events near the queried
timestamp and generates the 2D features. Lastly, the SpatialTemporal Implicit

extensional rheological experiments showed that Siluron 2000 is the only fluid
tested that exhibits a measurable elasticity. To characterise the dynamics
during saccadic eye movements, numerical simulations of all the VH substitutes

with Vitreous Humour flow dynamics to assess their potential mechanical
performance. Minor differences were found between the numerical results of a
viscoelastic fluid reproducing the rheology of Siluron 2000 and a Newtonian

propose a simple modification to the standard triplet loss, that explicitly
enforces separation amongst photos/sketch instances. For the latter, we put
forward a novel knowledge distillation module can leverage photo data for model

different photo instances while bringing closer a structurally augmented

pre-train a teacher on the large set of unlabelled photos over the

that in the student's embedding space, by matching the distribution over

introduce a federated edge learning (FEEL)-based training framework for
DL-based CSI feedback. This approach differs from the conventional centralized
learning (CL)-based framework in which the CSI datasets are collected at the
base station (BS) before training. Instead, each user equipment (UE) trains a
local autoencoder network and exchanges model parameters with the BS. This
approach provides better protection for data privacy compared to CL. To further
reduce communication overhead in FEEL, we quantize uplink and downlink model
transmission into different bits based on their influence on feedback
performance. Additionally, since the heterogeneity of CSI datasets in different
UEs can degrade the performance of the FEEL-based framework, we introduce a
personalization strategy to improve feedback performance. This strategy allows
for local fine-tuning to adapt the global model to the channel characteristics
of each UE. Simulation results indicate that the proposed personalized
FEEL-based training framework can significantly improve the performance of

other motivational beliefs. In this study, we focus on the physics identity
framework in which introductory students' physics identity is predicted by
their perceived recognition, self-efficacy and interest. We investigate the
relationships among these motivational beliefs by using structural equation
modeling (SEM) with many statistically equivalent models and discuss how our
theoretical framework guides us to select good models from amongst the
equivalent SEM models. Our theoretical framework suggests that in addition to
statistical information about the model fit, researchers should use other
evidence such as interview data and findings from prior studies as well as
instructional implications of each equivalent model to select good models.
According to prior interviews with students about their experiences in physics
learning environments, we find that the perception of not feeling positively
recognized by the instructors/TAs as a person who can excel in physics has the
potential to deteriorate students' physics self-efficacy and interest. In
addition, we note that the SEM models in which recognition predicts
self-efficacy and interest also have the potential to empower instructors and
help them understand their role in creating an inclusive and equitable learning
environment in which students are recognized and affirmed compared to other
equivalent models which may mask the important role instructors play in
supporting their students. Thus, even though all the equivalent models are
equally good from a statistical point of view, it is better to select the

not tackle the problem of the torso, limb, hand or face distortion caused by
perspective camera projection when the camera is close to the human body. The
naive focal length assumptions can harm this task with the incorrectly

analysing the reason for perspective distortion, which we find is mainly caused
by the relative location of the human body to the camera center. We propose a
new camera model and a novel 2D representation, termed distortion image, which

language. State-of-the-art systems respond to users in the same way regardless
of their personalities, although personalizing dialogues can lead to higher
levels of adoption and better user experiences. Building personalized dialog
systems is an important, yet challenging endeavor and only a handful of works
took on the challenge. Most existing works rely on supervised learning
approaches and require laborious and expensive labeled training data for each
user profile. Additionally, collecting and labeling data for each user profile
is virtually impossible. In this work, we propose a novel framework, P-ToD, to
personalize task-oriented dialog systems capable of adapting to a wide range of
user profiles in an unsupervised fashion using a zero-shot generalizable reward
function. P-ToD uses a pre-trained GPT-2 as a backbone model and works in three
phases. Phase one performs task-specific training. Phase two kicks off
unsupervised personalization by leveraging the proximal policy optimization
algorithm that performs policy gradients guided by the zero-shot generalizable
reward function. Our novel reward function can quantify the quality of the
generated responses even for unseen profiles. The optional final phase
fine-tunes the personalized model using a few labeled training examples. We
conduct extensive experimental analysis using the personalized bAbI dialogue
benchmark for five tasks and up to 180 diverse user profiles. The experimental
results demonstrate that P-ToD, even when it had access to zero labeled
examples, outperforms state-of-the-art supervised personalization models and
achieves competitive performance on BLEU and ROUGE metrics when compared to a
strong fully-supervised GPT-2 baseline

consensus model for trust in human-automation interaction by performing a

this objective, this work identifies the most frequently cited and
best-validated human-automation and human-robot trust questionnaires, as well
as the most well-established factors, which form the dimensions and antecedents
of such trust. To reduce both confusion and construct proliferation, we provide
a detailed mapping of terminology between questionnaires. Furthermore, we
perform a meta-analysis of the regression models that emerged from those

meta-analysis, we demonstrate a convergent experimentally validated model of
human-automation trust. This convergent model establishes an integrated
framework for future research. It identifies the current boundaries of trust
measurement and where further investigation is necessary. We close by
discussing choosing and designing an appropriate trust survey instrument. By
comparing, mapping, and analyzing well-constructed trust survey instruments, a
consensus structure of trust in human-automation interaction is identified.
Doing so discloses a more complete basis for measuring trust emerges that is
widely applicable. It integrates the academic idea of trust with the

cause serious image distortions which invalidate the single viewpoint
assumption. Hence the 3D geometry of such objects cannot be reliably

In order to account for complex light interactions, we develop a hybrid

recover the underlying geometry and appearance of the model by minimizing the
difference between the real and hybrid rendered images. We evaluate our method

may not always be of high quality, and each modality may have only partial
information of medical condition. Thus, predictions from different modalities
can be opposite, and the final prediction may fail in the presence of such a
conflict. Therefore, it is important to consider the reliability of each source
data and the prediction output when making a final decision. In this paper, we
propose an evidence-aware multi-modal data fusion framework based on the

non-image branch and a fusion branch. For each branch, there is an evidence

  (CVPR) 2023",,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) is a popular method in representing 3D scenes by
optimising a continuous volumetric scene function. Its large success which lies
in applying volumetric rendering (VR) is also its Achilles' heel in producing
view-dependent effects. As a consequence, glossy and transparent surfaces often
appear murky. A remedy to reduce these artefacts is to constrain this VR
equation by excluding volumes with back-facing normal. While this approach has
some success in rendering glossy surfaces, translucent objects are still poorly
represented. In this paper, we present an alternative to the physics-based VR
approach by introducing a self-attention-based framework on volumes along a
ray. In addition, inspired by modern game engines which utilise Light Probes to
store local lighting passing through the scene, we incorporate Learnable
Embeddings to capture view dependent effects within the scene. Our method,
which we call ABLE-NeRF, significantly reduces `blurry' glossy surfaces in
rendering and produces realistic translucent surfaces which lack in prior art.
In the Blender dataset, ABLE-NeRF achieves SOTA results and surpasses Ref-NeRF
in all 3 image quality metrics PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS.

two different regimes of suspension. At low rotation rate, particles are
strongly confined close to the bottom and are not able to reach the upper

particles are loosely confined: small particles become nearly homogeneously

recommender systems (RS) literature for over a decade. Meanwhile, the
pre-trained modality encoders, such as BERT and ViT, have become increasingly
powerful in modeling the raw modality features of an item, such as text and
images. Given this, a natural question arises: can a purely modality-based
recommendation model (MoRec) outperforms or matches a pure ID-based model
(IDRec) by replacing the itemID embedding with a SOTA modality encoder? In
fact, this question was answered ten years ago when IDRec beats MoRec by a
strong margin in both recommendation accuracy and efficiency. We aim to revisit
this `old' question and systematically study MoRec from several aspects.
Specifically, we study several sub-questions: (i) which recommendation
paradigm, MoRec or IDRec, performs better in practical scenarios, especially in
the general setting and warm item scenarios where IDRec has a strong advantage?
does this hold for items with different modality features? (ii) can the latest
technical advances from other communities (i.e., natural language processing
and computer vision) translate into accuracy improvement for MoRec? (iii) how
to effectively utilize item modality representation, can we use it directly or
do we have to adjust it with new data? (iv) are there some key challenges for
MoRec to be solved in practical applications? To answer them, we conduct
rigorous experiments for item recommendations with two popular modalities,
i.e., text and vision. We provide the first empirical evidence that MoRec is
already comparable to its IDRec counterpart with an expensive end-to-end
training method, even for warm item recommendation. Our results potentially
imply that the dominance of IDRec in the RS field may be greatly challenged in

lightweight structures with excellent mechanical characteristics and numerous
applications. With inspiration from the high strength-to-volume ratio of triply
periodic minimal surface (TPMS) structures, a new model of porous plates, which
is called a functionally graded TPMS (FG-TPMS) plate, is investigated in this
paper. Three TPMS architectures including Primitive (P), Gyroid (G), and
wrapped package-graph (IWP) with different graded functions are presented. To
predict the mechanical responses, a new fitting technique based on a two-phase
piece-wise function is employed to evaluate the effective moduli of TPMS
structures, including elastic modulus, shear modulus, and bulk modulus. In
addition, this function corresponds to the cellular structure formulation in
the context of relative density. The separated phases of the function are
divided by the different deformation behaviors. Furthermore, another crucial
mechanical property of porous structure, i.e, Poisson's ratio, is also achieved
by a similar fitting technique. To verify the mechanical characteristics of the
FG-TPMS plate, the generalized displacement field is modeled by a seventh-order
shear deformation theory (SeSDT) and isogeometric analysis (IGA). Numerical
examples regarding static, buckling, and free vibration analyses of FG-TPMS
plates are illustrated to confirm the reliability and accuracy of the proposed
approach. Consequently, these FG-TPMS structures can provide much higher
stiffness than the same-weight isotropic plate. The greater stiffness-to-weight
ratio of these porous plates compared to the full-weight isotropic ones should
be considered the most remarkable feature. Thus, these complex porous
structures have numerous practical applications because of these high ratios
and their fabrication ability through additive manufacturing (AM) technology.

(NeRFs) with pre-trained diffusion models holds great potential for text-to-3D

when rendering complex scenes from multi-object texts. Because the
text-to-image diffusion models are inherently unconstrained, making them less
competent to accurately associate object semantics with specific 3D structures.
To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, dubbed CompoNeRF, that
explicitly incorporates an editable 3D scene layout to provide effective
guidance at the single object (i.e., local) and whole scene (i.e., global)
levels. Firstly, we interpret the multi-object text as an editable 3D scene
layout containing multiple local NeRFs associated with the object-specific 3D
box coordinates and text prompt, which can be easily collected from users.
Then, we introduce a global MLP to calibrate the compositional latent features
from local NeRFs, which surprisingly improves the view consistency across
different local NeRFs. Lastly, we apply the text guidance on global and local
levels through their corresponding views to avoid guidance ambiguity. This way,
our CompoNeRF allows for flexible scene editing and re-composition of trained
local NeRFs into a new scene by manipulating the 3D layout or text prompt.
Leveraging the open-source Stable Diffusion model, our CompoNeRF can generate
faithful and editable text-to-3D results while opening a potential direction
for text-guided multi-object composition via the editable 3D scene layout.

distribution shifts arising in many real-world applications due to different
natural variations such as new lighting conditions, object poses, or background

out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization datasets. We demonstrate that simple
adaptation of state-of-the-art OOD generalization methods to AD settings fails

introduce a novel robust AD approach to diverse distribution shifts by
minimizing the distribution gap between in-distribution and OOD normal samples

empirical results on the three datasets show that our approach substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art AD methods and OOD generalization methods on data

feature with activations that are responsible for model mispredictions upon
adversarial attack. The Recalibration part then adjusts the non-robust

stability analysis and studied star formation, gas depletion times and other
environmental parameters on sub-kpc scales within the z~0 galaxy SDSS
J125013.84+073444.5 (LARS 8). The galaxy hosts a massive, clumpy disc and is a
proto-typical analogue of main-sequence galaxies at z~1-2. We show that the
massive (molecular) clumps in LARS 8 are the result of an extremely
gravitationally unstable gas disc, with large scale instabilities found across
the whole extent of the rotating disc, with only the innermost 500 pc being
stabilized by its bulgelike structure. The radial profiles further reveal that
- contrary to typical disc galaxies - the molecular gas depletion time
decreases from more than 1 Gyr in the center to less than ~100 Myr in the
outskirts of the disc, supporting the findings of a Toomre-unstable disc. We
further identified and analysed 12 individual massive molecular clumps. They
are virialized and follow the mass-size relation, indicating that on local
(cloud/clump) scales the stars form with efficiencies comparable to those in
Milky Way clouds. The observed high star formation rate must thus be the result
of triggering of cloud/clump formation over large scales due to disc
instability. Our study provides evidence that ""in-situ"" massive clump formation
(as also observed at high redshifts) is very efficiently induced by large-scale
instabilities.

Thus, a simple gradient-based optimization can be adapted to solve for them. We

recent transformer-based models brought some advances, we found that these
methods do not fully exploit the information of a given query. For example, the
relevance between text query and video contents is sometimes neglected when
predicting the moment and its saliency. To tackle this issue, we introduce
Query-Dependent DETR (QD-DETR), a detection transformer tailored for MR/HD. As
we observe the insignificant role of a given query in transformer
architectures, our encoding module starts with cross-attention layers to
explicitly inject the context of text query into video representation. Then, to
enhance the model's capability of exploiting the query information, we
manipulate the video-query pairs to produce irrelevant pairs. Such negative
(irrelevant) video-query pairs are trained to yield low saliency scores, which
in turn, encourages the model to estimate precise accordance between
query-video pairs. Lastly, we present an input-adaptive saliency predictor
which adaptively defines the criterion of saliency scores for the given

Our aim is to find a method that allows finding the optimal spectral sampling

technique based on a sequential selection approach where a neural network is
used to predict the spectrum (or physical quantities, if the model is known)
from the information at a few points. Only those points that contain relevant
information and improve the model prediction are included in the sampling
scheme. The method adapts the separation of the points according to the
spectral resolution of the instrument, the typical broadening of the spectral
shape, and the typical Doppler velocities. The experiments using the CaII 8542
A line show that the resulting wavelength scheme naturally places more points
in the core than in the wings, consistent with the sensitivity of the spectral
line at each wavelength interval. The method can also be used as an accurate
interpolator, to improve the inference of the magnetic field when using the
weak-field approximation. Overall, this method offers an objective approach for
designing new instrumentation or observing proposals with customized
configurations for specific targets. This is particularly relevant when
studying highly dynamic events in the solar atmosphere with a cadence that
preserves spectral coherence without sacrificing much information.

within a time window of 1000 s centered at the detection moment of a particular
GW event. Two types of incoming neutrino spectra were considered: the
mono-energetic line and the spectrum expected from supernovae. The same spectra
were considered for electron antineutrinos detected through inverse beta-decay
(IBD) reaction. GW candidates originated by merging binaries of black holes
(BHBH), neutron stars (NSNS) and neutron star and black hole (NSBH) were
analysed separately. In total, follow-ups of 74 out of 93 gravitational waves
reported in the GWTC-3 catalog were analyzed and no statistically significant
excess over the background was observed. As a result, the strongest upper
limits on GW-associated neutrino and antineutrino fluences for all flavors
(\nu_e, \nu_\mu, \nu_\tau) have been obtained in the (0.5 - 5.0) MeV neutrino
energy range.

distributions with only unlabeled test data streams. Most of the previous TTA
methods have achieved great success on simple test data streams such as
independently sampled data from single or multiple distributions. However,
these attempts may fail in dynamic scenarios of real-world applications like
autonomous driving, where the environments gradually change and the test data
is sampled correlatively over time. In this work, we explore such practical
test data streams to deploy the model on the fly, namely practical test-time
adaptation (PTTA). To do so, we elaborate a Robust Test-Time Adaptation (RoTTA)
method against the complex data stream in PTTA. More specifically, we present a
robust batch normalization scheme to estimate the normalization statistics.
Meanwhile, a memory bank is utilized to sample category-balanced data with
consideration of timeliness and uncertainty. Further, to stabilize the training
procedure, we develop a time-aware reweighting strategy with a teacher-student
model. Extensive experiments prove that RoTTA enables continual testtime
adaptation on the correlatively sampled data streams. Our method is easy to
implement, making it a good choice for rapid deployment. The code is publicly

challenging compared to 2D, mainly due to the increased number of neural
network parameters, the larger memory requirement and the limited amount of
available training data. Current SISR methods for 3D volumetric images are
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), especially Wasserstein GANs
due to their training stability. Other common architectures in the 2D domain,
e.g. transformer models, require large amounts of training data and are
therefore not suitable for the limited 3D data. However, Wasserstein GANs can
be problematic because they may not converge to a global optimum and thus
produce blurry results. Here, we propose a new method for 3D SR based on the
GAN framework. Specifically, we use instance noise to balance the GAN training.
Furthermore, we use a relativistic GAN loss function and an updating feature
extractor during the training process. We show that our method produces highly
accurate results. We also show that we need very few training samples. In
particular, we need less than 30 samples instead of thousands of training
samples that are typically required in previous studies. Finally, we show
improved out-of-sample results produced by our model.

teacher at Dongjiao Minxiang Primary School in Dongcheng District, Beijing. In
2022, she proposed that: (1) when explaining the knowledge points of frequency
in the ""Sound"" unit, experiments on the vibration of objects such as rubber
bands and steel rulers were used to assist students in learning, but the effect
was not obvious, because it was difficult for the naked eye to distinguish the
speed of vibration of objects such as rubber bands, and it was difficult to
correspond to the high and low frequencies; (2) Students seem to be confused
about the difference between frequency and amplitude. When guiding them to make
the rubber band vibrate faster, they tend to tug harder at the rubber band, but
this actually changes the amplitude rather than the frequency (changing the
frequency should be to control its vibrating chord length, similar to the
tuning method of a stringed instrument). Therefore, demonstration experiments
using objects such as rubber bands as frequencies do not seem suitable and
cannot effectively assist students in establishing the concept of frequency. We
hope to solicit opinions and solutions (research ideas) on this problem, with a
focus on two points: (1) the mathematical/physical explanation of the problem.
That is, does simply changing the amplitude really not affect the original
vibration frequency of the object (except when the amplitude is 0) (2)
explanation from a cognitive perspective: Why do people confuse the two
concepts? What is the cognitive mechanism behind it.

capture macroscopic, buoyancy-induced flows driven by the density mismatch

network formation, based on an effective accelerated sedimentation of nascent
clusters at low volume fractions that disrupts gelation. Above a critical
volume fraction, mechanical strength in the forming gel network dominates the
dynamics: the interface between the colloid-rich and colloid-poor region moves
downward at an ever decreasing rate. Finally, we analyze the asymptotic state,
the colloidal gel-like sediment, which we find not to be appreciably impacted
by the vigorous flows that can occur during the settling of the colloids. Our
findings represent the first steps toward understanding how flow during

used to improve speech quality. An ensemble of discriminators is commonly used
in recent neural vocoders (e.g., HiFi-GAN) and end-to-end text-to-speech (TTS)
systems (e.g., VITS) to scrutinize waveforms from multiple perspectives. Such
discriminators allow synthesized speech to adequately approach real speech;
however, they require an increase in the model size and computation time
according to the increase in the number of discriminators. Alternatively, this
study proposes a Wave-U-Net discriminator, which is a single but expressive
discriminator with Wave-U-Net architecture. This discriminator is unique; it
can assess a waveform in a sample-wise manner with the same resolution as the
input signal, while extracting multilevel features via an encoder and decoder
with skip connections. This architecture provides a generator with sufficiently
rich information for the synthesized speech to be closely matched to the real
speech. During the experiments, the proposed ideas were applied to a
representative neural vocoder (HiFi-GAN) and an end-to-end TTS system (VITS).
The results demonstrate that the proposed models can achieve comparable speech

to buy and sell goods directly, but it has also created problems, such as
commodity fraud and fake reviews. Trust Management Algorithms (TMAs) are
expected to be a countermeasure to detect fraudulent users. However, it is
unknown whether TMAs are as effective as reported as they are designed for
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communications between devices on a network. Here we examine
the applicability of `EigenTrust', a representative TMA, for the use case of
C2C services using an agent-based model. First, we defined the transaction
process in C2C services, assumed six types of fraudulent transactions, and then
analysed the dynamics of EigenTrust in C2C systems through simulations. We
found that EigenTrust could correctly estimate low trust scores for two types
of simple frauds. Furthermore, we found the oscillation of trust scores for two
types of advanced frauds, which previous research did not address. This
suggests that by detecting such oscillations, EigenTrust may be able to detect
some (but not all) advanced frauds. Our study helps increase the
trustworthiness of transactions in C2C services and provides insights into
further technological development for consumer services.

valuable addition to the toolbox of superconducting spintronics since they
promise to be long-range, fully spin-polarized, and with high current density.
However, experimental studies on the subject remain scarce because there are
only few HMFs available. Here we report on the generation of triplet
supercurrents in mesoscopic lateral Josephson junctions, fabricated with the
conventional superconductor NbTi and the HMF La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$
(LSMO), having a typical junction length of 20~nm. We use the electrode
geometry as a tool to examine the triplet generator in the HMF and study
junctions shaped as bar, square, and disk. In all junctions, we find strong
supercurrents and high current densities, that are independent of the junction
geometry and are insensitive to the application of in-plane fields, ruling out
the magnetic vorticity in the disk geometry as the generator. Analysis of the
critical current interference pattern upon application of a perpendicular
magnetic field shows that the triplet supercurrent is highly constricted to the
rims of the disk devices, yet uniformly distributed in the bar-shaped devices.
The appearance of these rim supercurrents is tied to the combination of triplet
transport and the disk geometry but is not central to the generator mechanism.
Next, we analyze the temperature dependence of the critical current and find in
its quadratic dependence a strong indication for the triplet nature of the
supercurrents. Finally, we find the supercurrent to persist in junctions
fabricated from a NbTi/Ag/LSMO trilayer. The results strongly indicate that the
magnetic inhomogeneity needed for triplet generation resides in the LSMO layer
adjacent to the NbTi/LSMO interface.

microfabricated alkali vapor cells filled with He and whose windows are made of
borosilicate glass (BSG) or aluminosilicate glass (ASG). The permeation is then
derived from routine measurements of the pressure-shifted hyperfine transition
frequency of an atomic clock. We first confirm that ASG reduces He permeation
rate by more than two orders of magnitude, in comparison with BSG. In addition,
we demonstrate that Al$_2$O$_3$ thin-film coatings, known to avoid alkali
consumption in vapor cells, can also significantly reduce He permeation. The
permeation through BSG is thereby reduced by a factor 110 whereas the one
through ASG is decreased by a factor up to 5.8 compared to uncoated substrates.

methods have been developed to improve the quality of low-resolution contrasts
by leveraging complementary information from multi-contrast MRI. Current deep
learning-based super-resolution methods have limitations in estimating
restoration uncertainty and avoiding mode collapse. Although the diffusion
model has emerged as a promising approach for image enhancement, capturing
complex interactions between multiple conditions introduced by multi-contrast
MRI super-resolution remains a challenge for clinical applications. In this
paper, we propose a disentangled conditional diffusion model, DisC-Diff, for

uncertainty in restorations effectively and ensure a stable optimization
process. Moreover, DisC-Diff leverages a disentangled multi-stream network to
fully exploit complementary information from multi-contrast MRI, improving
model interpretation under multiple conditions of multi-contrast inputs. We
validated the effectiveness of DisC-Diff on two datasets: the IXI dataset,

`traditional' measurements typically leads to 20\% uncertainty. We report on
crucial data augmentation techniques required to successfully train on

accounting for detector saturation. The same procedure can be repeated to apply
CNNs in a range of scenarios for strong-field ionization. Using a predictive
uncertainty estimation, reliable laser intensity uncertainties of a few percent
can be extracted, which are consistently lower than those given by traditional
techniques. Using interpretability methods can reveal parts of the distribution
that are most sensitive to laser intensity, which can be directly associated to
holographic interferences. The CNNs employed provide an accurate and convenient
ways to extract parameters, and represent a novel interpretational tool for
strong-field ionization spectra.

that, in general, the LLC4320 simulation accurately reproduces the observed SST
patterns, both globally and regionally. Global structure distribution medians
match within 2 sigma for 65% of the ocean, despite a modest, latitude-dependent
offset. Regionally, model outputs mimic mesoscale SST pattern variations in
VIIRS data revealed by PAE, including subtle features influenced by bathymetry
variations. There are however some areas showing significant differences in the
distribution of SST patterns: (1) near western boundary currents' separation
from the continental margin, (2) in the ACC, particularly in the eastern half
of the Indian Ocean, and (3) in an equatorial band equatorward of 15 deg. The
discrepancy in (1) results from premature separation of simulated western
boundary currents. In (2), the Southern Indian Ocean, the model output predicts
more structure than observed, possibly due to mixed layer misrepresentation or
energy dissipation and stirring inaccuracies in the simulation. The differences
in (3), the equatorial band, may also stem from model errors, potentially
arising from the simulation's shortness or insufficient
high-frequency/wavenumber atmospheric forcing. While the exact causes of these

`missing track searches' at the collider seems to confine fermion triplet DM
mass within a narrow range around 1 TeV. The canonical picture of pure triplet
fermionic DM is in tension since it is under-abundant for the said mass range.
Several preceding studies have shown that the existence of an extra species
over the radiation background, prior to the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, leads to
a fast expanding Universe driven by an enhanced Hubble parameter. This faster
(than radiation) expansion has the potential to revive the under-abundant
fermion triplet ($\mathbb{Z}_2$ odd) WIMP dark matter scenario by causing
freeze-out earlier without modifying the interaction strength between DM and
thermal bath. Although the CP asymmetry, produced due to the decay of
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ even heavier generations of the triplet, remains unaffected by
the modification of cosmology, the evolution of the same receives significant
non-trivial effect. It has been observed through numerical estimations that the
minimum mass of the decaying triplet, required to produce sufficient baryon
asymmetry, can be lowered up to two orders (compared to the standard cosmology)
in this fast expansion scenario. The non-standard parameters $n$ and $T_r$,
which simultaneously control the DM relic abundance as well the frozen value of
baryon asymmetry, are tightly constrained due to consecutive imposition of
experimental bounds on relic density followed by observed value of baryon
asymmetry of the Universe. It has been found that $n$ is strictly bounded
within the interval $0.4\lesssim n \lesssim 1.6$. The upper bound is imposed by
the baryon asymmetry constraint whereas the lower bound arises to satisfy the
correct relic abundance of the DM. The restriction on $T_r$ is not so stringent
as it can vary from sub GeV to few tens of GeV.

challenges on distributed-memory systems. They can lead to fine-grained remote

The Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) programming model addresses these
challenges by providing users with a view of a distributed-memory system that
resembles a single shared address space. However, this view often leads
programmers to write code that causes fine-grained remote communication, which
can result in poor performance. Prior work has shown that the performance of
irregular applications written in Chapel, a high-level PGAS language, can be
improved by manually applying optimizations. However, applying such
optimizations by hand reduces the productivity advantages provided by Chapel
and the PGAS model. We present an inspector-executor based compiler
optimization for Chapel programs that automatically performs remote data
replication. While there have been similar compiler optimizations implemented
for other PGAS languages, high-level features in Chapel such as implicit
processor affinity lead to new challenges for compiler optimization. We
evaluate the performance of our optimization across two irregular applications.

One major challenge however is to disentangle, or factorize, such data

possible combinations. This factorization becomes more challenging when queried
by noisy SBCs wherein symbol representations are relaxed due to perceptual
uncertainty and approximations made when modern neural networks are used to
generate the query vectors. To address these challenges, we first propose a
fast and highly accurate method for factorizing a more flexible and hence
generalized form of SBCs, dubbed GSBCs. Our iterative factorizer introduces a
threshold-based nonlinear activation, a conditional random sampling, and an
$\ell_\infty$-based similarity metric. Its random sampling mechanism in
combination with the search in superposition allows to analytically determine
the expected number of decoding iterations, which matches the empirical
observations up to the GSBC's bundling capacity. Secondly, the proposed
factorizer maintains its high accuracy when queried by noisy product vectors
generated using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This facilitates its
application in replacing the large fully connected layer (FCL) in CNNs, whereby
C trainable class vectors, or attribute combinations, can be implicitly

$\sqrt[\leftroot{-2}\uproot{2}F]{C}$ fixed codevectors. We provide a

that estimators are aligned to the study's objectives. Cluster randomised
trials require additional attributes to be defined within the estimand compared
to individually randomised trials, including whether treatment effects are
marginal or cluster specific, and whether they are participant or cluster
average. In this paper, we provide formal definitions of estimands encompassing
both these attributes using potential outcomes notation and describe
differences between them. We then provide an overview of estimators for each
estimand that are asymptotically unbiased under minimal assumptions. Then,
through a reanalysis of a published cluster randomised trial, we demonstrate
that estimates corresponding to the different estimands can vary considerably.
Estimated odds ratios corresponding to different estimands varied by more than
30 percent, from 3.69 to 4.85. We conclude that careful specification of the
estimand, along with appropriate choice of estimator, are essential to ensuring
that cluster randomised trials are addressing the right question.

finite element spaces. Special focus is given to the influence of the
Ginzburg-Landau parameter $\kappa$. This parameter is of physical interest as
large values can trigger the appearance of vortex lattices. Since the vortices
have to be resolved on sufficiently fine computational meshes, it is important
to translate the size of $\kappa$ into a mesh resolution condition, which can
be done through error estimates that are explicit with respect to $\kappa$ and
the spatial mesh width $h$. For that, we first work in an abstract framework
for a general class of discrete spaces, where we present convergence results in
a problem-adapted $\kappa$-weighted norm. Afterwards we apply our findings to
Lagrangian finite elements and a particular generalized finite element
construction. In numerical experiments we confirm that our derived $L^2$- and
$H^1$-error estimates are indeed optimal in $\kappa$ and $h$.

methods leveraged the rich data of imaging radars, and they usually omitted the
mapping aspect, thus leading to inferior odometry accuracy. This paper presents
a real-time imaging radar inertial odometry and mapping method, iRIOM, based on
the submap concept. To deal with moving objects and multipath reflections, we
use the graduated non-convexity method to robustly and efficiently estimate
ego-velocity from a single scan. To measure the agreement between sparse
non-repetitive radar scan points and submap points, the
distribution-to-multi-distribution distance for matches is adopted. The
ego-velocity, scan-to-submap matches are fused with the 6D inertial data by an
iterative extended Kalman filter to get the platform's 3D position and
orientation. A loop closure module is also developed to curb the odometry
module's drift. To our knowledge, iRIOM based on the two modules is the first
4D radar inertial SLAM system. On our and third-party data, we show iRIOM's
favorable odometry accuracy and mapping consistency against the FastLIO-SLAM
and the EKFRIO. Also, the ablation study reveal the benefit of inertial data
versus the constant velocity model, and scan-to-submap matching versus
scan-to-scan matching.

referred to as gradient scarcity. That is, learning graphs by minimizing a loss
on a subset of nodes causes edges between unlabelled nodes that are far from
labelled ones to receive zero gradients. The phenomenon was first described
when optimizing the graph and the weights of a Graph Neural Network (GCN) with
a joint optimization algorithm. In this work, we give a precise mathematical
characterization of this phenomenon, and prove that it also emerges in bilevel
optimization, where additional dependency exists between the parameters of the

field, we show that it also occurs with the Laplacian regularization model, in
the sense that gradients amplitude decreases exponentially with distance to
labelled nodes. To alleviate this issue, we study several solutions: we propose
to resort to latent graph learning using a Graph-to-Graph model (G2G), graph
regularization to impose a prior structure on the graph, or optimizing on a
larger graph than the original one with a reduced diameter. Our experiments on

emerging field of Green AI to consider energy consumption as a metric of equal
importance to accuracy and to reduce any irrelevant tasks or energy usage. We
examine the training stage of the deep learning pipeline from a sustainability
perspective, through the study of hyperparameter tuning strategies and the
model complexity, two factors vastly impacting the overall pipeline's energy
consumption. First, we investigate the effectiveness of grid search, random
search and Bayesian optimisation during hyperparameter tuning, and we find that
Bayesian optimisation significantly dominates the other strategies.
Furthermore, we analyse the architecture of convolutional neural networks with
the energy consumption of three prominent layer types: convolutional, linear
and ReLU layers. The results show that convolutional layers are the most
computationally expensive by a strong margin. Additionally, we observe
diminishing returns in accuracy for more energy-hungry models. The overall
energy consumption of training can be halved by reducing the network
complexity. In conclusion, we highlight innovative and promising
energy-efficient practices for training deep learning models. To expand the
application of Green AI, we advocate for a shift in the design of deep learning
models, by considering the trade-off between energy efficiency and accuracy.

diffractively scattered protons and one forward photon (measured at LHCf)
reduces the cross section for $p p \to p p \gamma$ almost to zero. On the other
hand, much less cross-section reduction occurs for $pp \to pp \gamma \gamma$

quantitatively study the underlying physical mechanisms behind observations. By
incorporating thermal conduction and radiation losses in the energy equation,
we develop a new data-driven radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, which
has the capability to capture the thermodynamic evolution compared to our
previous zero-\b{eta} model. Our numerical results reproduce major
observational characteristics of the X1.0 flare on 2021 October 28 in NOAA
active region (AR) 12887, including the morphology of the eruption, kinematic
of flare ribbons, extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) radiations, and two components of
the EUV waves predicted by the magnetic stretching model, i.e., a fast-mode
shock wave and a slower apparent wave due to successive stretching of magnetic
field lines. Moreover, some intriguing phenomena are revealed in the
simulation. We find that flare ribbons separate initially and ultimately stop
at the outer stationary quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs). Such outer QSLs
correspond to the border of the filament channel and determine the final
positions of flare ribbons, which can be used to predict the size and the
lifetime of a flare before it occurs. In addition, the side view of the
synthesized EUV and white-light images exhibit typical three-part structures of
CMEs, where the bright leading front is roughly cospatial with the non-wave
component of the EUV wave, reinforcing the magnetic stretching model for the
slow component of EUV waves.

explored because they do not require an additional re-training process which
might degrade the model's performance and increase the training cost. In this
study, from the perspective of neurons in the deep layer of the model
representing high-level features, we introduce a new aspect for analyzing the
difference in model outputs between in-distribution data and OOD data. We
propose a novel method, Leveraging Important Neurons (LINe), for post-hoc Out
of distribution detection.
  Shapley value-based pruning reduces the effects of noisy outputs by selecting
only high-contribution neurons for predicting specific classes of input data
and masking the rest. Activation clipping fixes all values above a certain
threshold into the same value, allowing LINe to treat all the class-specific
features equally and just consider the difference between the number of
activated feature differences between in-distribution and OOD data.
Comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by
outperforming state-of-the-art post-hoc OOD detection methods on CIFAR-10,

to reduce power consumption in digital neural network accelerators by selecting

frames and their transformations using covariant positive operator valued
measures to represent frame observables. The framework holds for locally
compact groups and differs from all prior proposals for frame changes, being
built around the notion of operational equivalence, in which states that cannot
be distinguished physically are identified. This allows for the construction of
the space of (invariant) relative observables and the convex set of relative
states as dual objects. By demanding a further equivalence relation on the
relative states which takes into account the nature of the frames, we provide a
quantum reference frame change map. We show that this map is invertible exactly
when the initial and final frames admit states which are arbitrarily well
localized. We compare the presented frame change with other constructions
available in the literature, finding operational agreement on the domain of
common applicability.

applications, where decisions can have profound individual and collective
impacts. Much current thinking regarding forms of oversight mechanisms for AI
within the public sector revolves around the idea of human decision makers
being 'in-the-loop' and thus being able to intervene to prevent errors and
potential harm. However, in a number of high-stakes public sector contexts,
operational oversight of decisions is made by expert teams rather than
individuals. The ways in which deployed AI systems can be integrated into these
existing operational team oversight processes has yet to attract much
attention. We address this gap by exploring the impacts of AI upon pre-existing
oversight of clinical decision-making through institutional analysis. We find
that existing oversight is nested within professional training requirements and
relies heavily upon explanation and questioning to elicit vital information.
Professional bodies and liability mechanisms also act as additional levers of
oversight. These dimensions of oversight are impacted, and potentially
reconfigured, by AI systems. We therefore suggest a broader lens of
'team-in-the-loop' to conceptualise the system-level analysis required for
adoption of AI within high-stakes public sector deployment.

intellectual property (IP) piracy and hardware Trojans (HTs). However, the
machine learning community has demonstrated that GNNs are susceptible to data
poisoning attacks, which result in GNNs performing abnormally on graphs with
pre-defined backdoor triggers (realized using crafted subgraphs). Thus, it is
imperative to ensure that the adoption of GNNs should not introduce security
vulnerabilities in critical security frameworks.
  Existing backdoor attacks on GNNs generate random subgraphs with specific
sizes/densities to act as backdoor triggers. However, for Boolean circuits,
backdoor triggers cannot be randomized since the added structures should not
affect the functionality of a design.
  We explore this threat and develop PoisonedGNN as the first backdoor attack
on GNNs in the context of hardware design. We design and inject backdoor
triggers into the register-transfer- or the gate-level representation of a
given design without affecting the functionality to evade some GNN-based
detection procedures. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PoisonedGNN, we
consider two case studies: (i) Hiding HTs and (ii) IP piracy. Our experiments
on TrustHub datasets demonstrate that PoisonedGNN can hide HTs and IP piracy
from advanced GNN-based detection platforms with an attack success rate of up
to 100%.

nonaxisymmetric, onto protoplanetary disks. We investigated nonaxisymmetric
late accretion considering the effects of magnetic fields. Our model assumes a
cloudlet encounter event at a few hundred au scale, where a magnetized gas
clump (cloudlet) encounters a protoplanetary disk. We studied how the cloudlet
size and the magnetic field strength affect the rotational velocity profile in
the disk after the cloudlet encounter. The results show that a magnetic field
can either decelerate or accelerate the rotational motion of the cloudlet
material, primarily depending on the relative size of the cloudlet to the disk
thickness. When the cloudlet size is comparable to or smaller than the disk
thickness, magnetic fields only decelerate the rotation of the colliding
cloudlet material. However, if the cloudlet size is larger than the disk
thickness, the colliding cloudlet material can be super-Keplerian as a result
of magnetic acceleration. We found that the vertical velocity shear of the
cloudlet produces a magnetic tension force that increases the rotational
velocity. The acceleration mechanism operates when the initial plasma $\beta$
is $ \beta \lesssim 2\times 10^1 $. Our study shows that magnetic fields modify
the properties of spirals formed by tidal effects. These findings may be
important for interpreting observations of late accretion.

success with large-scale corpora. However, the considerable cost of annotating
data motivates the need for learning strategies under low-resource settings. In
this paper, we investigate the problems of learning summarizers with only few
examples and propose corresponding methods for improvements. First, typical
transfer learning methods are prone to be affected by data properties and
learning objectives in the pretext tasks. Therefore, based on pretrained
language models, we further present a meta learning framework to transfer
few-shot learning processes from source corpora to the target corpus. Second,
previous methods learn from training examples without decomposing the content
and preference. The generated summaries could therefore be constrained by the
preference bias in the training set, especially under low-resource settings. As
such, we propose decomposing the contents and preferences during learning
through the parameter modulation, which enables control over preferences during
inference. Third, given a target application, specifying required preferences
could be non-trivial because the preferences may be difficult to derive through
observations. Therefore, we propose a novel decoding method to automatically
estimate suitable preferences and generate corresponding summary candidates
from the few training examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on six diverse corpora with
30.11%/33.95%/27.51% and 26.74%/31.14%/24.48% average improvements on

2.5 compared to the pristine variant. The hybrid aeromaterial is based on
strongly light-scattering framework structures composed of interconnected

extremely low amounts (in order of a few ${\mu}$g cm${^-}$${^3}$) of reduced

Ultimately, we combine the 33,115 best ISM spectra into six reddening bins with
a range of $0.1 \,\mathrm{mag} < E\mathrm{(B-V)} < 0.7\, \mathrm{mag}$. A total

fully understood. The sharp variations in sound speed located in these
transition regions give rise to a signature in specific seismic indicators,
opening the possibility to constrain the physics of convection to radiation
transition. Among those seismic indicators, the ratios of the small to large
frequency separation for $l=0$ and $1$ modes ($r_{010}$) were shown to be
particularly efficient to probe these transition regions. Interestingly, in the
Kepler Legacy F-type stars, the oscillatory signatures left in the $r_{010}$
ratios by the sharp sound-speed variation have unexpected large amplitudes that
still need to be explained. We show that the signature of the bottom of the
convective envelope is amplified in the ratios $r_{010}$ by the frequency
dependence of the amplitude compared to the signal seen in the frequencies
themselves or the second differences. We find that among the different options
of physical input investigated here, large amplitude signatures can only be
obtained when convective penetration of the surface convective zone into the
underlying radiative region is taken into account. In this case and even for
amplitudes as large as those observed in F-type stars, the oscillating
signature in the ratios can only be detected when the convective envelope is
deep enough. This deep extension of the convective envelope causes doubt that
the origin of the large amplitudes is due to penetrative convection as it is
modelled here or implies that current stellar modelling (without penetrative
convection) leads to an underestimation of the size of convective envelopes. In
any case, studying the glitch signatures of a large number of oscillating
F-type stars opens the possibility to constrain the physics of the stellar
interior in these regions.

collapse to the origin, limiting their applicability in deeper networks. We
provide an identity-based initialization that preserves norms over many layers.
(ii) Residual networks rely heavily on batch normalization, which comes with
expensive Fr\'echet mean calculations in hyperbolic space. We introduce
Poincar\'e midpoint batch normalization as a faster and equally effective

Bioimpedance (BI) measurements may serve as a non-invasive alternative for

processes the local BI of the lower abdomen and suppresses artefacts to measure
the bladder volume quantitatively, non-invasively and without the continuous

was used to collect continuous bladder volume data from three healthy subjects
to demonstrate feasibility of operation, while clinical gold standards of
urodynamic (n=6) and uroflowmetry tests (n=8) provided the ground truth.
Optimized location for electrode placement and a model for the change in BI

comparable to commercial portable ultrasound devices (Bland Altman analysis
showed a bias of -5.2 ml with LoA between 119.7 ml to -130.1 ml), while

transitions mediated through an intermediate virtual state where each atom is
separately coupled to a dissipative reservoir at zero temperature in the
presence of the Stark shift effect. We have investigated the dynamics of this
atomic system for two different initial conditions of the environment. In the
first case, we have assumed the environment's state to be in ground state and
in the other case, we have assumed the state to be in first excited state. The
second initial condition is significant as it shows the role played by both the
Stark shift parameters in contrast to only one of the Stark shift parameters
for the first initial condition. Our results demonstrate that quantum
correlations can be sustained for an extended period in the presence of Stark
shift effect in the case of both Markovian and non-Markovian reservoirs. The
effect in the non-Markovian reservoir is more prominent than the Markovian
reservoir, even for a very small value of the Stark shift parameter. We observe
that among the correlation measures considered, only local quantum uncertainty
is accompanied by a sudden change phenomenon, i.e., an abrupt change in the
decay rate of a correlation measure. Our findings are significant as preserving
quantum correlations is one of the essential aspects in attaining optimum
performance in quantum information tasks.

offers a potential route to high-repetition-rate, GeV-scale plasma accelerators
driven by picosecond-duration laser pulses from, for example, kilohertz
thin-disk lasers. The first stage of the P-MoPA scheme is a plasma modulator in
which a long, high-energy 'drive' pulse is spectrally modulated by
co-propagating in a plasma channel with the low-amplitude plasma wave driven by
a short, low-energy 'seed' pulse. The spectrally modulated drive pulse is
converted to a train of short pulses, by introducing dispersion, which can
resonantly drive a large wakefield in a subsequent accelerator stage with the
same on-axis plasma density as the modulator. In this paper we derive the 3D
analytic theory for the evolution of the drive pulse in the plasma modulator
and show that the spectral modulation is independent of transverse coordinate,
which is ideal for compression into a pulse train. We then identify a
transverse mode instability (TMI), similar to the TMI observed in optical fiber
lasers, which sets limits on the energy of the drive pulse for a given set of
laser-plasma parameters. We compare this analytic theory with particle-in-cell
(PIC) simulations and find that even higher energy drive pulses can be
modulated than those demonstrated in the original proposal.

class of parallel systems and explores their potential. Parallel systems arise
in relevant cases, such as in multi-band mobile networks, multi-technology
wireless access, or multi-path protocols, just to name a few. Typically,
control over each communication channel is limited and random service outages
and congestion cause buffering that impairs the age-of-information. The
parallel use of independent channels promises a remedy, since outages on one
channel may be compensated for by another. Surprisingly, for the well-known
case of M$\mid$M$\mid$1 queues we find the opposite: pooling capacity in one
channel performs better than a parallel system with the same total capacity. A
generalization is not possible since there are no solutions for other types of
parallel queues at hand. In this work, we prove a dual representation of
age-of-information in min-plus algebra that connects to queueing models known
from the theory of effective bandwidth/capacity and the stochastic network
calculus. Exploiting these methods, we derive tail bounds of the
age-of-information of parallel G$\mid$G$\mid$1 queues. In addition to parallel
classical queues, we investigate Markov channels where, depending on the memory
of the channel, we show the true advantage of parallel systems. We continue to
investigate this new finding and provide insight into when capacity should be
pooled in one channel or when independent parallel channels perform better. We
complement our analysis with simulation results and evaluate different update
policies, scheduling policies, and the use of heterogeneous channels that is
most relevant for latest multi-band networks.

are even, one-sided monotone, and attain their maximum at the origin. The
method initially considers weaker solutions than in earlier works, and is not
limited to small waves: a family of solutions is obtained, along which the
dispersive energy is continuous and increasing. In general, our construction
admits more than one solution for each energy level, and waves with the same
energy level may have different heights. Although a transformation in the
construction hinders us from concluding the family with an extreme wave, we
give a quantitative proof that the set reaches `large' or 'intermediate-sized'

performance but suffers from high training costs resulting from slow
convergence and long training time, especially on large-scale web datasets. An
essential obstacle to training efficiency lies in the entangled prediction rate
(percentage of tokens for reconstruction) and corruption rate (percentage of
corrupted tokens) in masked language modeling (MLM), that is, a proper
corruption rate is achieved at the cost of a large portion of output tokens
being excluded from prediction loss. To accelerate the convergence of VLP, we
propose a new pretraining task, namely, free language modeling (FLM), that
enables a 100% prediction rate with arbitrary corruption rates. FLM
successfully frees the prediction rate from the tie-up with the corruption rate
while allowing the corruption spans to be customized for each token to be
predicted. FLM-trained models are encouraged to learn better and faster given
the same GPU time by exploiting bidirectional contexts more flexibly. Extensive
experiments show FLM could achieve an impressive 2.5x pretraining time
reduction in comparison to the MLM-based methods, while keeping competitive
performance on both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. Code

manual annotation, we achieve this compression by generating 0-1 masks on

0-1 masks with an arbitrary threshold leads to a trade-off between the coverage
on discriminative pixels and the quantity of exemplars, as the total memory is

method for this task with natural motions of the lip, facial expression, head
pose, and eye states. Due to the coupling of the mixed information of human
voice and background music in common signals of music audio, we design a
decouple-and-fuse strategy to tackle the challenge. We first decompose the
input music audio into human voice stream and background music stream. Due to
the implicit and complicated correlation between the two-stream input signals
and the dynamics of the facial expressions, head motions and eye states, we
model their relationship with an attention scheme, where the effects of the two
streams are fused seamlessly. Furthermore, to improve the expressiveness of the
generated results, we propose to decompose head movements generation into speed
generation and direction generation, and decompose eye states generation into
the short-time eye blinking generation and the long-time eye closing generation
to model them separately. We also build a novel SingingFace Dataset to support
the training and evaluation of this task, and to facilitate future works on
this topic. Extensive experiments and user study show that our proposed method
is capable of synthesizing vivid singing face, which is better than

rewriting, gs-monoidal categories are symmetric monoidal categories where each
object is equipped with the structure of a commutative comonoid. They arise for
example as Kleisli categories of commutative monads on cartesian categories,
and as such they provide a general framework for effectful computation.
Recently proposed in the context of categorical probability, Markov categories
are gs-monoidal categories where the monoidal unit is also terminal, and they
arise for example as Kleisli categories of commutative affine monads, where
affine means that the monad preserves the monoidal unit. The aim of this paper
is to study a new condition on the gs-monoidal structure, resulting in the
concept of weakly Markov categories, which is intermediate between gs-monoidal
categories and Markov ones. In a weakly Markov category, the morphisms to the
monoidal unit are not necessarily unique, but form a group. As we show, these
categories exhibit a rich theory of conditional independence for morphisms,
generalising the known theory for Markov categories. We also introduce the
corresponding notion for commutative monads, which we call weakly affine, and
for which we give two equivalent characterisations. The paper argues that these
monads are relevant to the study of categorical probability. A case at hand is
the monad of finite non-zero measures, which is weakly affine but not affine.
Such structures allow to investigate probability without normalisation within
an elegant categorical framework.

ideal magnetohydrodynamic instability and the resistive magnetic reconnection.
Due to the close coupling and synchronicity of the two mechanisms, it is
difficult to identify their respective contribution to solar eruptions,
especially to the critical rapid acceleration phase. Here, to shed light on
this problem, we conduct a data-driven numerical simulation for the flux rope
eruption on 2011 August 4, and quantify the contributions of the upward exhaust
of the magnetic reconnection along the flaring current sheet and the work done
by the large-scale Lorentz force acting on the flux rope. Major simulation
results of the eruption, such as the macroscopic morphology, early kinematics
of the flux rope and flare ribbons, match well with the observations. We
estimate the energy converted from the magnetic slingshot above the current
sheet and the large-scale Lorentz force exerting on the flux rope during the
rapid acceleration phase, and find that (1) the work done by the large-scale
Lorentz force is about 4.6 times higher than the former, and (2) decreased
strapping force generated by the overlying field facilitates the eruption.
These results indicate that the large-scale Lorentz force plays a dominant role
in the rapid acceleration phase for this eruption.

no deflection and full deflection, we demonstrate that it is possible to
extract the (time-averaged) concentration of deflectable charge carriers,
$\left<n_d\right>$, the average, temperature-dependent mobility of those
carriers, $\left<\mu_d\right>(T)$, as well as the ratio of conductivity that
comes from such deflectable transport, $d(T)$. Our method was enabled by the
construction of an improved AC Hall measurement system, as well as an improved
data extraction method. We measured Hall bar devices of ion-exchange doped
films of PBTTT-C$_{14}$ from 10--300 K. Our analysis provides evidence for the
proportion of conductivity arising from deflectable transport, $d(T)$,
increasing with doping level, ranging between 15.4% and 16.4% at room
temperature. When compared to total charge-carrier-density estimates from
independent methods, the values of $\left<n_d\right>$ extracted suggest that
carriers spend $\sim$37% of their time of flight being deflectable in the most
highly doped of the devices measured here. The extracted values of $d(T)$ being
less than half this value thus suggest that the limiting factor for
conductivity in such highly doped devices is carrier mobility, rather than
concentration.

associated entanglement wedges and their roleplay in obtaining the correct Page
curve of radiation. The first proposal has been give for the before Page time
scenario, which shows that the mutual information $I(R_{H}^{+}:R_{H}^{-})$
vanishes at a certain value of the observer's time $t_{b_{H}}=t_{H}$ (where
$t_{H}\ll \beta_{H}$). We claim that this is the Hartman-Maldacena time at
which the entanglement wedge associated to $R_{H}^{+}\cup R_{H}^{-}$ gets
disconnected and the fine-grained radiation entropy has the form $S(R_{H})\sim
\log(\beta_{H})$. The second proposal depicts the fact that just after the Page
time, when the replica wormholes are the dominating saddle-points, the mutual
information $I(B_{H}^{+}:B_{H}^{-})$ vanishes as soon as the time difference
$t_{a_{H}}-t_{b_{H}}$ equals the scrambling time. Holographically, this
reflects that the entanglement wedge associated to $B_{H}^{+}\cup B_{H}^{-}$
jumps to the disconnected phase at this particular time-scale. Furthermore,
these two proposals lead us to the correct time-evolution of the fine-grained
entropy of radiation as portrayed by the Page curve. We have also shown that
similar observations can be obtained for the radiation associated to the
cosmological horizon.

exhibiting an active and continuous resonance tuning with associated 2pi phase

strongly suppressing crosstalk among pixels. This device is used to demonstrate
dynamic beam steering with wide field-of-view and high absolute diffraction

movement patterns is critical for identifying potential threats in a timely
manner. Once detected, it is important to monitor and track these vessels until
a necessary intervention occurs. To achieve this, track association algorithms
are used, which take sequential observations comprising geological and motion
parameters of the vessels and associate them with respective vessels. The
spatial and temporal variations inherent in these sequential observations make
the association task challenging for traditional multi-object tracking
algorithms. Additionally, the presence of overlapping tracks and missing data
can further complicate the trajectory tracking process. To address these
challenges, in this study, we approach this tracking task as a multivariate
time series problem and introduce a 1D CNN-LSTM architecture-based framework
for track association. This special neural network architecture can capture the
spatial patterns as well as the long-term temporal relations that exist among
the sequential observations. During the training process, it learns and builds
the trajectory for each of these underlying vessels. Once trained, the proposed
framework takes the marine vessel's location and motion data collected through
the Automatic Identification System (AIS) as input and returns the most likely
vessel track as output in real-time. To evaluate the performance of our
approach, we utilize an AIS dataset containing observations from 327 vessels

computation, but they suffer from several challenges. Gate errors, coherence
errors and a lack of connectivity all contribute to low fidelity results. In
particular, connectivity restrictions enforce a gate set that requires
three-qubit gates to be decomposed into one- or two-qubit gates. This
substantially increases the number of two-qubit gates that need to be executed.
However, many quantum devices have access to higher energy levels. We can
expand the qubit abstraction of $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ to a ququart which
has access to the $|2\rangle$ and $|3\rangle$ state, but with shorter coherence
times. This allows for two qubits to be encoded in one ququart, enabling
increased virtual connectivity between physical units from two adjacent qubits
to four fully connected qubits. This connectivity scheme allows us to more
efficiently execute three-qubit gates natively between two physical devices.
  We present direct-to-pulse implementations of several three-qubit gates,
synthesized via optimal control, for compilation of three-qubit gates onto a
superconducting-based architecture with access to four-level devices with the
first experimental demonstration of four-level ququart gates designed through
optimal control. We demonstrate strategies that temporarily use higher level
states to perform Toffoli gates and always use higher level states to improve
fidelities for quantum circuits. We find that these methods improve expected
fidelities with increases of 2x across circuit sizes using intermediate
encoding, and increases of 3x for fully-encoded ququart compilation.

important for setting limits on the contribution of massive compact objects to
the Galactic halo. These estimates of detection efficiency must not only
account for the blending effects of accidentally superimposed sources in
crowded fields, but also for possible mixing of light from stars belonging to
multiple gravitationally bound stellar systems. Until now, only accidental
blending have been studied, in particular thanks to high resolution space

rate, which we extrapolate to the distance of the LMC. Then, we estimate the
maximum fraction of the cases for which a microlensing event could be
significantly modified, as a function of the lens mass. We find that less than
6.2% of microlensing events on LMC sources due to halo lenses heavier than $30
M_{\odot}$ can be significantly affected by the fact that the sources belong to
unresolved binary systems. For events caused by lighter lenses on LMC sources,
our study shows that the risk of blending effects by binary systems is likely
to be higher and efficiency calculations remain more uncertain.

through corruption of the input by adversarial perturbations:
human-imperceptible artificial noise. So far adversarial training has been the
most successful defense against such adversarial attacks. This work focuses on
improving adversarial training to boost adversarial robustness. We first
analyze, from an instance-wise perspective, how adversarial vulnerability
evolves during adversarial training. We find that during training an overall
reduction of adversarial loss is achieved by sacrificing a considerable
proportion of training samples to be more vulnerable to adversarial attack,
which results in an uneven distribution of adversarial vulnerability among
data. Such ""uneven vulnerability"", is prevalent across several popular robust
training methods and, more importantly, relates to overfitting in adversarial
training. Motivated by this observation, we propose a new adversarial training
method: Instance-adaptive Smoothness Enhanced Adversarial Training (ISEAT). It
jointly smooths both input and weight loss landscapes in an adaptive,
instance-specific, way to enhance robustness more for those samples with higher
adversarial vulnerability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
our method over existing defense methods. Noticeably, our method, when combined

such pairs as distracted pairs. Our intuition is that using semantically
meaningful distractors enables the model to learn related variations and attain
robustness against challenging deviations, compared to conventional
augmentation schemes focusing only on low-level aspects and modifications. More
specifically, in addition to the supervised loss computed between the estimated
flow for the original pair and its ground-truth flow, we include a second
supervised loss defined between the distracted pair's flow and the original
pair's ground-truth flow, weighted with the same mixing ratio. Furthermore,
when unlabeled data is available, we extend our augmentation approach to
self-supervised settings through pseudo-labeling and cross-consistency
regularization. Given an original pair and its distracted version, we enforce
the estimated flow on the distracted pair to agree with the flow of the
original pair. Our approach allows increasing the number of available training

operate in the original image domain, they are memory-intensive and less
feasible for multi-modal synthesis. Moreover, they often fail to preserve the
anatomical structure in MRI. Further, balancing the multiple conditions from

next-generation communication systems. In massive MIMO cellular networks,
coordinated beamforming (CBF), which jointly designs the beamformers of
multiple base stations (BSs), is an efficient method to enhance the network
performance. In this paper, we investigate the sum rate maximization problem in
a massive MIMO mobile cellular network, where in each cell a multi-antenna BS
serves multiple mobile users simultaneously via downlink beamforming. Although
existing optimization-based CBF algorithms can provide near-optimal solutions,
they require realtime and global channel state information (CSI), in addition
to their high computation complexity. It is almost impossible to apply them in
practical wireless networks, especially highly dynamic mobile cellular
networks. Motivated by this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning based
distributed dynamic coordinated beamforming (DDCBF) framework, which enables
each BS to determine the beamformers with only local CSI and some historical
information from other BSs.Besides, the beamformers can be calculated with a
considerably lower computational complexity by exploiting neural networks and
expert knowledge, i.e., a solution structure observed from the iterative
procedure of the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm.
Moreover, we provide extensive numerical simulations to validate the

particular, we argue that the emergent gravity effectively is a manifestation
of the entanglement entropy and can modify Newton's law of gravity as well as
address the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies. In the cosmological setup,
we have considered three different models for the apparent dark matter density.
In the first model, we have found that Friedmann equations get modified due to
the presence of the apparent dark matter (DM) in such a way that Newton's
constant of gravity shifts as $G\rightarrow G_N=G\left(1+\zeta\right)$, where
$\zeta$ is a dimensionless small parameter. This modification basically
coincides with the modified gravity (MOG) theory. Using the flat rotating
curves we estimate $\zeta \sim 10^{-7}$. Interestingly enough, for such a
model, we find out that by rescaling the radial coordinate, $r$, the curvature
space constant, $k$, and the scale factor of the universe, $a$, the effect of
apparent DM can change the geometry of the universe and can shift the curvature
space constant as $k_{\star}=k (1-\zeta)$. Finally, we study a more realistic

quantitative metrics. The pretrained transformer can capture the global
topological relations (i.e., self-similarity) of image, and we observe that the
captured topological relations about the sharp image will change when blur
occurs. By comparing the transformer features between recovered image and
target one, the pretrained transformer provides high-resolution blur-sensitive
semantic information, which is critical in measuring the sharpness of the
deblurred image. On the basis of the advantages, we present two types of novel
perceptual losses to guide image deblurring. One regards the features as
vectors and computes the discrepancy between representations extracted from
recovered image and target one in Euclidean space. The other type considers the
features extracted from an image as a distribution and compares the
distribution discrepancy between recovered image and target one. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of transformer properties in improving the perceptual quality
while not sacrificing the quantitative scores (PSNR) over the most competitive
models, such as Uformer, Restormer, and NAFNet, on defocus deblurring and
motion deblurring tasks.

underlying neurobiological substrates could be associated with treatment
response variability. Understanding the sources of this variability and
predicting outcomes has been elusive. Machine learning has shown promise in
predicting treatment response in MDD, but one limitation has been the lack of
clinical interpretability of machine learning models. We analyzed data from six
clinical trials of pharmacological treatment for depression (total n = 5438)
using the Differential Prototypes Neural Network (DPNN), a neural network model
that derives patient prototypes which can be used to derive treatment-relevant
patient clusters while learning to generate probabilities for differential
treatment response. A model classifying remission and outputting individual
remission probabilities for five first-line monotherapies and three combination
treatments was trained using clinical and demographic data. Model validity and
clinical utility were measured based on area under the curve (AUC) and expected
improvement in sample remission rate with model-guided treatment, respectively.
Post-hoc analyses yielded clusters (subgroups) based on patient prototypes
learned during training. Prototypes were evaluated for interpretability by
assessing differences in feature distributions and treatment-specific outcomes.
A 3-prototype model achieved an AUC of 0.66 and an expected absolute
improvement in population remission rate compared to the sample remission rate.
We identified three treatment-relevant patient clusters which were clinically
interpretable. It is possible to produce novel treatment-relevant patient
profiles using machine learning models; doing so may improve precision medicine
for depression. Note: This model is not currently the subject of any active
clinical trials and is not intended for clinical use.

venerable Euler's equations which are based on the assumption that the relative
distances among the constituent particles are fixed in time. Real bodies,
however, cannot satisfy this property, as a consequence of thermal
fluctuations. We generalize Euler's equations for a free body in order to
describe dissipative and thermal fluctuation effects in a thermodynamically
consistent way. The origin of these effects is internal, i.e. not due to an
external thermal bath. The stochastic differential equations governing the
orientation and central moments of the body are derived from first principles
through the theory of coarse-graining. Within this theory, Euler's equations
emerge as the reversible part of the dynamics. For the irreversible part, we
identify two distinct dissipative mechanisms; one associated with diffusion of
the orientation, whose origin lies in the difference between the spin velocity
and the angular velocity, and one associated with the damping of dilations,
i.e. inelasticity. We show that a deformable body with zero angular momentum
will explore uniformly, through thermal fluctuations, all possible
orientations. When the body spins, the equations describe the evolution towards
the alignment of the body's major principal axis with the angular momentum
vector. In this alignment process, the body increases its temperature. We
demonstrate that the origin of the alignment process is not inelasticity but
rather orientational diffusion. The theory also predicts the equilibrium shape
of a spinning body.

some degree of data reduction to only save those features or images pertaining

compute these scores. However, these algorithms have not been subjected to a
principled comparison, making it difficult for stakeholders to choose the
algorithm in an evidence-based manner. The key challenge in comparing existing
algorithms and developing better algorithms is the lack of the publicly
available gold-standard data that would be needed to perform reproducible
research. We address this challenge by collecting a novel dataset of similarity
scores that we release to the research community. Our dataset consists of 477
self-reported expertise scores provided by 58 researchers who evaluated their
expertise in reviewing papers they have read previously.
  We use this data to compare several popular algorithms employed in computer
science conferences and come up with recommendations for stakeholders. Our main
findings are as follows. First, all algorithms make a non-trivial amount of
error. For the task of ordering two papers in terms of their relevance for a
reviewer, the error rates range from 12%-30% in easy cases to 36%-43% in hard
cases, highlighting the vital need for more research on the

to work with titles and abstracts of papers, and in this regime the Specter+MFR
algorithm performs best. Third, to improve performance, it may be important to
develop modern deep-learning based algorithms that can make use of the full
texts of papers: the classical TD-IDF algorithm enhanced with full texts of
papers is on par with the deep-learning based Specter+MFR that cannot make use
of this information.

function, reduction formulas of $_{3}F_{2}$ hypergeometric functions, or a
definite integral which does not seem to be tabulated in the most common
literature. As an application of some sums involving the digamma function, we
have calculated some redution formulas for the parameter differentiation of the
Mittag-Leffler function and the Wright function.

entities in text, without having access to labeled data during training. This
setting is particularly relevant for domain specific RE where no annotated
dataset is available and for open-domain RE where the types of relations are a
priori unknown. Although recent approaches achieve promising results, they
heavily depend on hyperparameters whose tuning would most often require labeled
data. To mitigate the reliance on hyperparameters, we propose PromptORE, a
''Prompt-based Open Relation Extraction'' model. We adapt the novel
prompt-tuning paradigm to work in an unsupervised setting, and use it to embed
sentences expressing a relation. We then cluster these embeddings to discover
candidate relations, and we experiment different strategies to automatically
estimate an adequate number of clusters. To the best of our knowledge,
PromptORE is the first unsupervised RE model that does not need hyperparameter
tuning. Results on three general and specific domain datasets show that
PromptORE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models with a relative gain
of more than 40% in B 3 , V-measure and ARI. Qualitative analysis also
indicates PromptORE's ability to identify semantically coherent clusters that
are very close to true relations.

than a billion devices would be utilized across the globe by the end of 2030.
To maximize the capability of these connected entities, trust and reputation
among IoT entities is essential. Several trust management models have been
proposed in the IoT environment; however, these schemes have not fully
addressed the IoT devices features, such as devices role, device type and its
dynamic behavior in a smart environment. As a result, traditional trust and
reputation models are insufficient to tackle these characteristics and
uncertainty risks while connecting nodes to the network. Whilst continuous
study has been carried out and various articles suggest promising solutions in
constrained environments, research on trust and reputation is still at its
infancy. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive literature review on
state-of-the-art research on the trust and reputation of IoT devices and
systems. Specifically, we first propose a new structure, namely a new taxonomy,
to organize the trust and reputation models based on the ways trust is managed.
The proposed taxonomy comprises of traditional trust management-based systems
and artificial intelligence-based systems, and combine both the classes which
encourage the existing schemes to adapt these emerging concepts. This
collaboration between the conventional mathematical and the advanced ML models
result in design schemes that are more robust and efficient. Then we drill down
to compare and analyse the methods and applications of these systems based on
community-accepted performance metrics, e.g. scalability, delay,
cooperativeness and efficiency. Finally, built upon the findings of the
analysis, we identify and discuss open research issues and challenges, and
further speculate and point out future research directions.

  transformed graphical feature of characteristic curves and convolutional
  neural network with CBAM modules",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Various faults can occur during the operation of PV arrays, and both the
dust-affected operating conditions and various diode configurations make the
faults more complicated. However, current methods for fault diagnosis based on
I-V characteristic curves only utilize partial feature information and often
rely on calibrating the field characteristic curves to standard test conditions
(STC). It is difficult to apply it in practice and to accurately identify
multiple complex faults with similarities in different blocking diodes
configurations of PV arrays under the influence of dust. Therefore, a novel
fault diagnosis method for PV arrays considering dust impact is proposed. In
the preprocessing stage, the Isc-Voc normalized Gramian angular difference
field (GADF) method is presented, which normalizes and transforms the resampled
PV array characteristic curves from the field including I-V and P-V to obtain
the transformed graphical feature matrices. Then, in the fault diagnosis stage,
the model of convolutional neural network (CNN) with convolutional block
attention modules (CBAM) is designed to extract fault differentiation
information from the transformed graphical matrices containing full feature
information and to classify faults. And different graphical feature
transformation methods are compared through simulation cases, and different
CNN-based classification methods are also analyzed. The results indicate that
the developed method for PV arrays with different blocking diodes
configurations under various operating conditions has high fault diagnosis
accuracy and reliability.

sense, without which we could not survive. Classical physics is modelled on
this common-sense view of nature, and uses mathematics to formalise our natural
understanding of the causes and effects we observe in time and space when we
select subsystems of nature for modelling. But in modern physics, we do not go
beyond the realm of common sense by augmenting our knowledge of what is going
on in nature. Rather, we have measurements that we do not understand, so we
know nothing about the ontology of what we measure. We help ourselves by using
entities from mathematics, which we fully understand ontologically. But we have
no ontology of the reality of modern physics; we have only what we can assert
mathematically. In this paper, we describe the ontology of classical and modern
physics against this background and show how it relates to the ontology of

that use nonlinear mechanical resonators and corresponding transducers to
create electrical output. Nonlinearities are important for providing a
broadband input frequency efficiency, which is necessary to ensure that the
output voltage is at a satisfactory level in the case of a variable ambient
vibration source. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of such a system with
the additional possibility of a switching potential barrier in the nonlinear
resonator. In order to improve the effectiveness of the energy harvester, we
numerically test the possibility of using abrupt changes in the system
parameters. We analyze the voltage output for various frequencies of both the
harmonic excitations and the potential barrier switching. In a range that
includes low and high switching frequencies of potentials, the periodic
solutions dominate in the bifurcation diagrams. With regard to the large
switching frequency, the effective values of the voltage at the piezoelectric
electrodes are significantly reduced. The highest effective values of the
voltage that are induced at the piezoelectric electrodes are observed when the
chaotic solutions appear due to their specific ability to pass the potential
barrier for relatively small excitation. The results also show that mechanical
damping with high-enough magnitudes minimize the influence of the transient
states caused by the switching potentials.

the gas within galaxies (i.e., the interstellar medium; ISM), it is also
crucial to study the molecular gas reservoirs surrounding each galaxy (i.e., in
the circumgalactic medium; CGM). Recent observations of galaxies and quasars
hosts at high redshift (z>2) have revealed evidence for cold gaseous halos of
scale r_CGM~10kpc, with one discovery of a molecular halo with r_CGM~200kpc and
a molecular gas mass one order of magnitude larger than the ISM of the central
galaxy. As a follow-up, we present deep ACA and ALMA observations of CO(3-2)
from this source and two other quasar host galaxies at z~2.2. While we find
evidence for CO emission on scales of r~10kpc, we do not find evidence for
molecular gas on scales larger than r>20 kpc. Therefore, our deep data do not
confirm the existence of massive molecular halos on scales of ~100 kpc for
these X-ray selected quasars. As an interesting by-product of our deep
observations, we obtain the tentative detection of a negative continuum signal
on scales larger than r>200kpc, which might be tracing the Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effect associated with the halo heated by the active galactic nucleus (AGN). If
confirmed with deeper data, this could be direct evidence of the preventive AGN
feedback process expected by cosmological simulations.

counterfeit objects into the mainstream market by adversaries. Such
infiltration of bogus products can be addressed with third-party-verifiable
identification. Generally, state-of-the-art identification schemes do not
guarantee that an identifier e.g. barcodes or RFID itself cannot be forged.
This paper introduces identification patterns representing the objects
intrinsic identity by robust hashes and not only by generated identification
patterns. Inspired by these two notions, a collection of uniquely identifiable
attributes called quasi-identifiers (QI) can be used to identify an object.
Since all attributes do not contribute equally towards an object's identity,
each QI has a different contribution towards the identifier. A robust hash
developed utilising the QI has been named fuzzified robust hashes (FaR hashes),
which can be used as an object identifier. Although the FaR hash is a single
hash string, selected bits change in response to the modification of QI. On the
other hand, other QIs in the object are more important for the object's
identity. If these QIs change, the complete FaR hash is going to change. The
calculation of FaR hash using attributes should allow third parties to generate
the identifier and compare it with the current one to verify the genuineness of
the object.

degeneracy problem of line triangulation, carefully crafted scoring and track
building, and exploiting structural priors such as line coincidence,

further improve the line reconstruction. Furthermore, as a byproduct, the
method is able to recover 3D association graphs between lines and points /

task of finding the subgraph on $k$ vertices with the maximum number of edges.
This is a fundamental problem that has been subject to intense study for
decades, with applications spanning a wide variety of fields. The
state-of-the-art algorithm is an $O(n^{1/4 + \epsilon})$-factor approximation
(for any $\epsilon > 0$) due to Bhaskara et al. [STOC '10]. Moreover, the
so-called log-density framework predicts that this is optimal, i.e. it is
impossible for an efficient algorithm to achieve an $O(n^{1/4 -
\epsilon})$-factor approximation. In the average case, Densest $k$-Subgraph is
a prototypical noisy inference task which is conjectured to exhibit a
statistical-computational gap.
  In this work, we provide the strongest evidence yet of hardness for Densest
$k$-Subgraph by showing matching lower bounds against the powerful
Sum-of-Squares (SoS) algorithm, a meta-algorithm based on convex programming
that achieves state-of-art algorithmic guarantees for many optimization and
inference problems. For $k \leq n^{\frac{1}{2}}$, we obtain a degree
$n^{\delta}$ SoS lower bound for the hard regime as predicted by the
log-density framework.
  To show this, we utilize the modern framework for proving SoS lower bounds on
average-case problems pioneered by Barak et al. [FOCS '16]. A key issue is that
small denser-than-average subgraphs in the input will greatly affect the value
of the candidate pseudoexpectation operator around the subgraph. To handle this
challenge, we devise a novel matrix factorization scheme based on the positive
minimum vertex separator. We then prove an intersection tradeoff lemma to show
that the error terms when using this separator are indeed small.

multiple (finite) identical copies of the states are available, then in brief,
we say that the ensemble is many-copy indistinguishable. Here we explore the
notions -- unextendibility, uncompletability and analyze their connections to
many-copy indistinguishable ensembles. We show that the orthogonal complement
of any bipartite pure entangled state is spanned by product states which form a
nonorthogonal unextendible product basis (nUPB) of maximum cardinality. This
subspace, which is spanned by the states of an nUPB of maximum cardinality, has
one to one correspondence with the maximum dimensional subspace where there is
no orthonormal product basis. Explicit construction of the product states,
forming any such nUPB is shown. Due to these, the proof of indistinguishability
of a class of ensembles under LOCC in many-copy scenario becomes simpler.
Furthermore, it is now clear that there are several many-copy indistinguishable
ensembles, construction-wise they are different but if we consider only
indistinguishability property under LOCC, then, many of them are connected
through the general notion of unextendible product basis. Thereafter, we
introduce the notion of positive partial transpose uncompletability to unify
different many-copy indistinguishable ensembles. We also report a class of
multipartite many-copy indistinguishable ensembles for which local
indistinguishability property increases with decreasing mixedness. This is not
usual as mixedness usually introduce difficulty in discrimination. Finally, we
discuss the role of bound entanglement in this context.

asynchronous measurements for linear continuous-time systems under false data
attacks on the measurement transmit channel. After sampling the output of the
system, a sensor transmits the measurement information in a triple composed of
sensor index, time-stamp, and measurement value to the fusion center via
vulnerable communication channels. The malicious attacker can corrupt a subset
of the sensors through (i) manipulating the time-stamp and measurement value;
(ii) blocking transmitted measurement triples; or (iii) injecting fake
measurement triples. To deal with such attacks, we propose the design of local
estimators based on observability space decomposition, where each local
estimator updates the local state and sends it to the fusion center after
sampling a measurement. Whenever there is a local update, the fusion center
combines all the local states and generates a secure state estimate by adopting
the median operator. We prove that local estimators of benign sensors are
unbiased with stable covariance. Moreover, the fused central estimation error
has bounded expectation and covariance against at most $p$ corrupted sensors as
long as the system is $2p$-sparse observable. The efficacy of the proposed
scheme is demonstrated through an application on a benchmark example of the
IEEE 14-bus system.

the significance of the coordinate system. We discuss the extension of the
International Astronomical Union (IAU) reference system to the exact theory. It
is seen that such an extension, retaining some of its crucial properties, can
be achieved in a special class of spacetimes, admitting non-shearing
congruences of observers which, at infinity, have zero vorticity and
acceleration. As applications, we consider the FLRW, Kerr and NUT spacetimes,
the van Stockum rotating dust cylinder, spinning cosmic strings and, finally,
we debunk the so-called Balasin-Grumiller (BG) model, and the claims that the
galaxies' rotation curves can be explained through gravitomagnetic effects
without the need for Dark Matter. The BG spacetime is shown to be completely
inappropriate as a galactic model: its dust is actually static with respect to
the asymptotic inertial frame, its gravitomagnetic effects arise from
unphysical singularities along the axis (a pair of NUT rods, combined with a
spinning cosmic string), and the rotation curves obtained are merely down to an
invalid choice of reference frame -- the congruence of zero angular momentum
observers, which are being dragged by the singularities.

to distill the knowledge of high-resource language into low-resource languages:
(1) incorporating a strong pre-trained high-resource language encoder and (2)

of a linear coordinate transformation and additive-dependent Gaussian vectors.
We formulate the synthesis of the distorting mechanisms as a convex program. In

are not practically possible using classical computation, useful quantum
computing is still a long way off. One important reason is due to the fragile
nature of quantum hardware. As the building blocks of a quantum circuit (QC),
quantum gates and qubits are susceptible to external interference, and
therefore even a simple QC can produce extremely noisy output. Since it is hard
to distinguish whether the output represents meaningful computation or just
random noise, it raises the question of how much we can rely on the output of a
QC, i.e., the fidelity of the QC. In this paper, we purpose a simple yet
intuitive metric to measure the fidelity of a QC. By using this metric, we can
observe the evolution of fidelity with time as the QC interacts with its
external environment. Consequently, we can frame fidelity prediction as a Time
Series Forecasting problem and use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural
networks to better estimate the fidelity of a QC. This gives the user better
opportunities to optimize the mapping of qubits into the quantum hardware for
larger gains. We introduce the LSTM architecture and present a complete
workflow to build the training circuit dataset. The trained LSTM system, Q-fid,
can predict the output fidelity of a QC running on a specific quantum
processor, without the need for any separate input of hardware calibration data
or gate error rates. Evaluated on the QASMbench NISQ benchmark suite, Q-fid's
prediction achieves an average RMSE of 0.0515, up to 24.7x more accurate than

the SSDA problem from two perspectives that have previously been overlooked,
and correspondingly decompose it into two \emph{key subproblems}: \emph{robust
domain adaptation (DA) learning} and \emph{maximal cross-domain data
utilization}. \textbf{(i)} From a causal theoretical view, a robust DA model
should distinguish the invariant ``concept'' (key clue to image label) from the
nuisance of confounding factors across domains. To achieve this goal, we
propose to generate \emph{concept-invariant samples} to enable the model to
classify the samples through causal intervention, yielding improved
generalization guarantees; \textbf{(ii)} Based on the robust DA theory, we aim
to exploit the maximal utilization of rich source domain data and a few labeled
target samples to boost SSDA further. Consequently, we propose a
collaboratively debiasing learning framework that utilizes two complementary
semi-supervised learning (SSL) classifiers to mutually exchange their unbiased
knowledge, which helps unleash the potential of source and target domain
training data, thereby producing more convincing pseudo-labels. Such obtained
labels facilitate cross-domain feature alignment and duly improve the invariant
concept learning. In our experimental study, we show that the proposed model
significantly outperforms SOTA methods in terms of effectiveness and

interesting challenges with far-reaching implications in both, our fundamental

control of entanglement. Yet, when it involves composites of indistinguishable
quantum systems, the very meaning of entanglement, and hence its
characterization, still finds controversy and lacks a widely accepted

and self-contained exposition, the basic ideas behind one of the approaches
advanced towards the construction of a coherent definition of entanglement in
systems of indistinguishable particles, with focus on fermionic systems. We
also inquire whether the corresponding tools developed for studying
entanglement in identical-fermion systems can be exploited when analysing
correlations in distinguishable-party systems, in which the complete
information of the individual parts is not available. Further, we open the
discussion on the broader problem of constructing a suitable framework that
accommodates entanglement in presence of generalized statistics.

are not connected at once to the same system. Quantum entanglement between
localized spins is an essential property for the development of quantum
computing and quantum information. It is for this reason that generating and
controlling an entangled state between quantum dots received great attention in
the later years.
  In this work, we show that the information on the spin orientation of a
quantum dot can be kept, using the Kondo entanglement, in a reservoir of
electrons. Then, this information can be transmitted to another dot after the
first dot has been uncoupled from the reservoirs. We use a double quantum dot
system in a parallel geometry to construct the initial state, where each dot
interacts with reservoirs of different symmetries. We chose a phase in the
couplings to induce an antiferromagnetic spin correlation between the dots. The
time evolution of the initial state has been analyzed using the time-dependent
density matrix renormalization group method.
  We found that a partially entangled state between the dots can be obtained,
even if they are not connected at the same time. This entangled state is formed
just during the transient and is destroyed in the stationary state. The
stability of the state found in the transient is shown. To understand the
details of these phenomena, a canonical transformation of the real space is
used.

fine-grained control over the properties of the different objects present in

of these properties, we identify structure and appearance as the most intuitive

Structure-and-Appearance Paired Diffusion model (PAIR-Diffusion), which is
trained using structure and appearance information explicitly extracted from
the images. The proposed model enables users to inject a reference image's
appearance into the input image at both the object and global levels.
Additionally, PAIR-Diffusion allows editing the structure while maintaining the
style of individual components of the image unchanged. We extensively evaluate
our method on LSUN datasets and the CelebA-HQ face dataset, and we demonstrate

face generation, the quality of the generated video still lags behind that of
real recordings. One reason for this is the use of handcrafted intermediate
representations like facial landmarks and 3DMM coefficients, which are designed
based on human knowledge and are insufficient to precisely describe facial
movements. Additionally, these methods require an external pretrained model for
extracting these representations, whose performance sets an upper bound on
talking face generation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
method called DAE-Talker that leverages data-driven latent representations
obtained from a diffusion autoencoder (DAE). DAE contains an image encoder that
encodes an image into a latent vector and a DDIM image decoder that
reconstructs the image from it. We train our DAE on talking face video frames
and then extract their latent representations as the training target for a
Conformer-based speech2latent model. This allows DAE-Talker to synthesize full
video frames and produce natural head movements that align with the content of
speech, rather than relying on a predetermined head pose from a template video.
We also introduce pose modelling in speech2latent for pose controllability.
Additionally, we propose a novel method for generating continuous video frames
with the DDIM image decoder trained on individual frames, eliminating the need
for modelling the joint distribution of consecutive frames directly. Our
experiments show that DAE-Talker outperforms existing popular methods in
lip-sync, video fidelity, and pose naturalness. We also conduct ablation
studies to analyze the effectiveness of the proposed techniques and demonstrate
the pose controllability of DAE-Talker.

step, the player is presented with a price and decides whether to accept or
reject it. The player incurs a switching cost whenever their decision changes
in consecutive time steps, i.e., whenever they pause or resume purchasing. This
online problem is motivated by the goal of carbon-aware load shifting, where a
workload may be paused during periods of high carbon intensity and resumed
during periods of low carbon intensity and incurs a cost when saving or
restoring its state. It has strong connections to existing problems studied in
the literature on online optimization, though it introduces unique technical
challenges that prevent the direct application of existing algorithms.
Extending prior work on threshold-based algorithms, we introduce
double-threshold algorithms for both the minimization and maximization variants

where most training examples are seen only a few times by the model during the
course of training. What does a model remember about such examples seen only a
few times during training and how long does that memory persist in the face of
continuous training with new examples? Here, we investigate these questions
through simple recognition, recall, and retention experiments with LLMs. In
recognition experiments, we ask if the model can distinguish the seen example
from a novel example; in recall experiments, we ask if the model can correctly
recall the seen example when cued by a part of it; and in retention
experiments, we periodically probe the model's memory for the original examples
as the model is trained continuously with new examples. We find that a single
exposure is generally sufficient for a model to achieve near perfect accuracy
even in very challenging recognition experiments. We estimate that the
recognition performance of even small language models easily exceeds human
recognition performance reported in similar experiments with humans (Shepard,
1967). Achieving near perfect recall takes more exposures, but most models can
do it in just 3 exposures. The flip side of this remarkable capacity for fast
learning is that precise memories are quickly overwritten: recall performance
for the original examples drops steeply over the first 10 training updates with
new examples, followed by a more gradual decline. Even after 100K updates,
however, some of the original examples are still recalled near perfectly. A
qualitatively similar retention pattern has been observed in human long-term
memory retention studies before (Bahrick, 1984). Finally, recognition is much
more robust to interference than recall and memory for natural language
sentences is generally superior to memory for stimuli without structure.

relaxes the strict one-to-one constraint and achieves a soft cross-modal
alignment by introducing a softened target, which is generated from the
fine-grained intra-modal self-similarity. The intra-modal guidance is
indicative to enable two pairs have some local similarities and model
many-to-many relationships between the two modalities. Besides, since the
positive still dominates in the softened target distribution, we disentangle
the negatives in the distribution to further boost the relation alignment with
the negatives in the cross-modal learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of SoftCLIP. In particular, on ImageNet zero-shot
classification task, using CC3M/CC12M as pre-training dataset, SoftCLIP brings
a top-1 accuracy improvement of 6.8%/7.2% over the CLIP baseline.

occurs progressively decreases as $\theta$ increases. The surface averaged
Nusselt number ($Nu_{\text{av}}$) increases with $Re$, whereas the drag force
experienced by the cylinder decreases with $Re$. The transient regime is
characterized by periodic vortex shedding, which is quantified by the Strouhal

$\theta$ for a given $Re$. $Nu_{\text{av}}$ also exhibits a time-varying
oscillatory behaviour with a time period which is half the time period of
vortex shedding. The amplitude of oscillation of $Nu_{\text{av}}$ increases
with $\theta$.

for effects from spatial and temporal circuit context. Since coherent errors
accumulate quadratically while incoherent errors grow linearly, we can separate
them by fitting the measured fidelity as a function of n. One can additionally
interleave the subcircuit with dynamical decoupling sequences to remove certain
coherent error sources from the characterization when desired. We have used
CAFE to experimentally validate our single- and two-qubit unitary
characterizations by measuring fidelity against estimated unitaries. In
numerical simulations, we find CAFE produces fidelity estimates at least as

introduce a compact formulation for preparing an arbitrary two-qubit state with

systems. While they are undeniably powerful tools, ML models often demonstrate
imbalanced performance and unfair behaviors. The root of this problem often
lies in the fact that different subpopulations commonly display divergent
trends: as a learning algorithm tries to identify trends in the data, it
naturally favors the trends of the majority groups, leading to a model that
performs poorly and unfairly for minority populations. Our goal is to improve
the fairness and trustworthiness of ML models by applying only non-invasive
interventions, i.e., without altering the data or the learning algorithm. We
use a simple but key insight: the divergence of trends between different
populations, and, consecutively, between a learned model and minority
populations, is analogous to data drift, which indicates the poor conformance
between parts of the data and the trained model. We explore two strategies
(model-splitting and reweighing) to resolve this drift, aiming to improve the
overall conformance of models to the underlying data. Both our methods
introduce novel ways to employ the recently-proposed data profiling primitive
of Conformance Constraints. Our experimental evaluation over 7 real-world
datasets shows that both DifFair and ConFair improve the fairness of ML models.
We demonstrate scenarios where DifFair has an edge, though ConFair has the
greatest practical impact and outperforms other baselines. Moreover, as a
model-agnostic technique, ConFair stays robust when used against different
models than the ones on which the weights have been learned, which is not the
case for other state of the art.

well-lit images, but also in perceiving heterogeneous regions with different
luminance, facilitating the optimization of the enhancement network. Unlike
high-level and image manipulation tasks, directly applying CLIP to enhancement
tasks is non-trivial, owing to the difficulty in finding accurate prompts. To
solve this issue, we devise a prompt learning framework that first learns an
initial prompt pair by constraining the text-image similarity between the
prompt (negative/positive sample) and the corresponding image (backlit
image/well-lit image) in the CLIP latent space. Then, we train the enhancement
network based on the text-image similarity between the enhanced result and the
initial prompt pair. To further improve the accuracy of the initial prompt
pair, we iteratively fine-tune the prompt learning framework to reduce the
distribution gaps between the backlit images, enhanced results, and well-lit
images via rank learning, boosting the enhancement performance. Our method
alternates between updating the prompt learning framework and enhancement
network until visually pleasing results are achieved. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of
visual quality and generalization ability, without requiring any paired data.

$SU(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills are governed by a universal
Laplace-difference equation. Here $\mathcal{O}^{(i)}_p$ is a superconformal
primary with charge $p$ and degeneracy $i$. These observables, called
integrated correlators, are modular functions of coupling $\tau$. The
Laplace-difference equation relates integrated correlators of different charges
recursively. In this paper, we introduce generating functions for the
integrated correlators that sum over the charge. By utilising the
Laplace-difference equation, we determine the generating functions given
initial data. We show that the transseries of the integrated correlators in the
large-$p$ (large-charge) expansion consists of three parts: 1) is independent
of $\tau$ as a power series in $1/p$, plus an additional $\log(p)$ term if
$i=j$; 2) is a power series in $1/p$, with coefficients given by a sum of the
non-holomorphic Eisenstein series; 3) is a sum of exponentially decayed modular
functions in the large-$p$ limit, which can be viewed as a generalisation of
the non-holomorphic Eisenstein series. When $i=j$, there is an additional
modular function that is independent of $p$ and is determined by the integrated
correlator with $p=2$. The Laplace-difference equation was obtained with a
reorganisation of the operators that means the large-charge limit is taken in a
particular way here. From the $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-invariant results, we also
determine the generalised 't Hooft genus expansion and associated large-$p$
non-perturbative corrections of the integrated correlators by introducing
$\lambda = pg^2_{YM}$. The generating functions have subtle differences between
even and odd $N$ with important consequences in resurgence.

knowledge contained in relevant documents. However, many models generate
hallucinated responses instead that contradict it or contain unverifiable
information. To mitigate such undesirable behaviour, it has been proposed to
fine-tune a `negative expert' on negative examples and subtract its parameters
from those of a pre-trained model. However, intuitively, this does not take
into account that some parameters are more responsible than others in causing
hallucinations. Thus, we propose to weigh their individual importance via (an
approximation of) the Fisher Information matrix, which measures the uncertainty
of their estimate. We call this method Elastic Weight Removal (EWR). We
evaluate our method -- using different variants of Flan-T5 as a backbone
language model -- on multiple datasets for information-seeking dialogue
generation and compare our method with state-of-the-art techniques for
faithfulness, such as CTRL, Quark, DExperts, and Noisy Channel reranking.
Extensive automatic and human evaluation shows that EWR systematically
increases faithfulness at minor costs in terms of other metrics. However, we
notice that only discouraging hallucinations may increase extractiveness, i.e.
shallow copy-pasting of document spans, which can be undesirable. Hence, as a
second main contribution, we show that our method can be extended to
simultaneously discourage hallucinations and extractive responses. We publicly

Robot Attention Demand and ensured 91% more Fan-out time compared to the
standard method. Additionally, VAHR led to a 62.5% improvement in
multi-tasking, highlighting the potential for efficient human-robot interaction
in physically- and mentally-demanding scenarios. However, subjective metrics
revealed a need for human operators to build confidence and trust with this new
method of operation.

diagnostic of the outer solar atmosphere from spectropolarimetric observations,
especially in prominences, filaments, and spicules. However, the goodness of
these approximations is yet to be assessed, especially in situations where the
optical thickness is of the order or larger than one, and radiation transfer
has a significant impact in the local anisotropy and the ensuing spectral line
polarization. This issue becomes particularly relevant in the ongoing
development of new inversion tools which take into account multi-dimensional
radiation transfer effects. To relax these approximations we generalize the
multi-term equations for the atomic statistical equilibrium to allow for
differential illumination of the multiplet components and implement them in a
one-dimensional radiative transfer code. We find that, even for this simple
geometry and relatively small optical thickness, both radiation transfer and

polarization profiles. This should be taken into account in order to avoid
potentially significant errors in the inference of the magnetic field vector.

queueing systems under a FCFS-ALIS service discipline, where each arriving
customer is only compatible with a subset of servers. We analyze the system
under conventional heavy-traffic conditions, where the traffic intensity
approaches one from below. Building upon the formulation and results of Afeche
et al. 2021, we generalize the model by allowing the vector of arrival rates to
approach the heavy-traffic limit from an arbitrary direction. We characterize
the steady-state waiting times of the various customer classes and demonstrate
that a much wider range of waiting time outcomes is achievable. Furthermore, we
establish that the matching probabilities, i.e., the probabilities of different
customer classes being served by different servers, do not depend on the
direction along which the system approaches heavy traffic. We also investigate
the design of compatibility between customer classes and servers, finding that
a service provider who has complete control over the matching can design a
delay-minimizing menu by considering only the limiting arrival rates. When some
constraints on the compatibility structure exist, the direction of convergence
to heavy-traffic affects which menu minimizes delay. Additionally, we discover
that the bipartite matching queueing system exhibits a form of Braess's
paradox, where adding more connectivity to an existing system can lead to
higher average waiting times, despite the fact that neither customers nor
servers act strategically.

true GS of antiferromagnets is highly entangled, as confirmed by very recent
neutron scattering experiments witnessing their entanglement. Although GS of
ferromagnets is always unentangled, their magnonic low-energy excitation are
superpositions of many-body spin states and, therefore, entangled. In this
study, we initialize quantum Heisenberg ferro- or antiferromagnetic chains
hosing localized spins $S=1/2$, $S=1$ or $S=5/2$ into unentangled pure state
and then evolve them by quantum master equations (QMEs) of Lindblad or
non-Markovian type, derived by coupling localized spins to a bosonic bath (such
as due to phonons) or by using additional ``reaction coordinate'' in the latter

and entanglement of time-evolving {\em mixed} quantum states is monitored by
computing its logarithmic negativity. We find that non-Markovian dynamics
maintains some degree of entanglement, which shrinks the length of the vector
of spin expectation values, thereby making the LLG equation inapplicable.
Conversely, Lindbladian (i.e., Markovian) dynamics ensures that entanglement
goes to zero, thereby enabling quantum-to-classical (i.e., to LLG) transition

RF-RL means that works studying RF-RL largely do not require their models to
generalize to new environments. In this work, we instead look to minimize,
rather than completely eliminate, resets while building visual agents that can
meaningfully generalize. As studying generalization has previously not been a
focus of benchmarks designed for RF-RL, we propose a new Stretch Pick-and-Place
benchmark designed for evaluating generalizations across goals, cosmetic
variations, and structural changes. Moreover, towards building performant
reset-minimizing RL agents, we propose unsupervised metrics to detect
irreversible transitions and a single-policy training mechanism to enable
generalization. Our proposed approach significantly outperforms prior episodic,
reset-free, and reset-minimizing approaches achieving higher success rates with
fewer resets in Stretch-P\&P and another popular RF-RL benchmark. Finally, we
find that our proposed approach can dramatically reduce the number of resets
required for training other embodied tasks, in particular for RoboTHOR
ObjectNav we obtain higher success rates than episodic approaches using 99.97\%
fewer resets.

  Framework for Human-Centric Visual Tasks","accepted by CVPR2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Human-centric visual tasks have attracted increasing research attention due
to their widespread applications. In this paper, we aim to learn a general
human representation from massive unlabeled human images which can benefit
downstream human-centric tasks to the maximum extent. We call this method
SOLIDER, a Semantic cOntrollable seLf-supervIseD lEaRning framework. Unlike the
existing self-supervised learning methods, prior knowledge from human images is
utilized in SOLIDER to build pseudo semantic labels and import more semantic
information into the learned representation. Meanwhile, we note that different
downstream tasks always require different ratios of semantic information and
appearance information. For example, human parsing requires more semantic
information, while person re-identification needs more appearance information
for identification purpose. So a single learned representation cannot fit for
all requirements. To solve this problem, SOLIDER introduces a conditional
network with a semantic controller. After the model is trained, users can send
values to the controller to produce representations with different ratios of
semantic information, which can fit different needs of downstream tasks.
Finally, SOLIDER is verified on six downstream human-centric visual tasks. It
outperforms state of the arts and builds new baselines for these tasks. The

batched over blocks, actual speedup with window activation pruning becomes
possible: i.e., ~50% latency reduction with 60% sparsity. Different layers
should be assigned with different pruning ratios due to their diverse

opportunity to measure sulfur abundances and so directly test between competing
modes of planet formation. In contrast to carbon and oxygen, whose dominant
molecules are frequently observed, sulfur is much less volatile and resides
almost exclusively in solid form in protoplanetary disks. This dichotomy leads
different models of planet formation to predict different compositions of gas
giant planets. Whereas planetesimal-based models predict roughly stellar C/S
and O/S ratios, pebble accretion models more often predict superstellar ratios.
To explore the detectability of SO2 in transmission spectra and its ability to
diagnose planet formation, we present a grid of atmospheric photochemical
models and corresponding synthetic spectra for WASP-39b (where SO2 has been
detected). Our 3D grid contains 11^3 models (spanning 1--100x the solar
abundance ratio of C, O, and S) for thermal profiles corresponding to the
morning and evening terminators, as well as mean terminator transmission
spectra. Our models show that for a WASP-39b-like O/H and C/H enhancement of
~10x Solar, SO2 can only be seen for C/S and O/S <~1.5, and that WASP-39b's
reported SO2 abundance of 1--10 ppm may be more consistent with planetesimal
accretion than with pebble accretion models (although some pebble models also
manage to predict similarly low ratios). More extreme C/S and O/S ratios may be
detectable in higher-metallicity atmospheres, suggesting that smaller and more
metal-rich gas and ice giants may be particularly interesting targets for
testing planet formation models. Future studies should explore the dependence
of SO2 on a wider array of planetary and stellar parameters, both for the
prototypical SO2 planet WASP-39b, as well as for other hot Jupiters and smaller

coronagraphs during the 2022 May apparition indicate that the observed
brightening and tail development instead capture the release of sodium atoms,
which resonantly fluoresce at the 589.0/589.6 nm D lines. While HI1's design
bandpass nominally excludes the D lines, filter degradation has substantially
increased its D line sensitivity, as quantified by the brightness of Mercury's

cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to model the expected emission signal for
the CO rotational transition in the COMAP LIM experiment at the 5-year
benchmark and the Ly-$\alpha$ forest absorption signal for various surveys,
including eBOSS, DESI, and PFS. We show that CO$\times$Ly-$\alpha$ forest can
significantly enhance the detection signal-to-noise ratio of CO, with a $200$
to $300 \%$ improvement when cross-correlated with the forest observed in the
Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) survey and a $50$ to $75\%$ enhancement for the
currently available eBOSS or the upcoming DESI observations. We compare to the
signal-to-noise improvements expected for a galaxy survey and show that
CO$\times$Ly-$\alpha$ is competitive with even a spectroscopic galaxy survey in
raw signal-to-noise. Furthermore, our study suggests that the clustering of CO
emission is tightly constrained by CO$\times$Ly-$\alpha$ forest, due to the
increased signal-to-noise ratio and the simplicity of Ly-$\alpha$ absorption
power spectrum modeling. Any foreground contamination or systematics are
expected not to be shared between LIM surveys and Ly-$\alpha$ forest
observations; this provides an unbiased inference. Our findings highlight the
potential benefits of utilizing the Ly-$\alpha$ forest to aid in the initial
detection of signals in line intensity experiments. For example, we also
estimate that [CII]$\times$Ly-$\alpha$ forest measurements from EXCLAIM and
DESI/eBOSS, respectively, should have a larger signal-to-noise ratio than
planned [CII]$\times$quasar observations by about an order of magnitude. Our
results can be readily applied to actual data thanks to the observed quasar
spectra in eBOSS Stripe 82, which overlaps with several LIM surveys.

consider the application of disorder in two ways: a symmetric one, where the
same disorder is applied to the top and bottom sites of a unit cell, and an
antisymmetric one, where the disorder applied to the top and bottom sites are
of equal magnitude but with opposite signs. The single-particle wave-packet
dynamics for the clean system and when the disorder is applied symmetrically
show quantum caging; in the antisymmetric case, the wave-packet spreads over
the entire lattice. These results agree with our previous work, where compact
localization was observed in the case of the clean system and for symmetrically
disordered diamond lattices. In the presence of nearest-neighbour interactions,
nonergodic phases are observed in the case of a clean system and symmetrical
disorder; at higher disorder strengths, we find an MBL-like phase in the
symmetric case. However, many-body non-equilibrium dynamics of the system from
carefully engineered initial states exhibit quantum caging. In the
antisymmetric case, a nonergodic mixed phase, a thermal phase and an MBL-like
phases, respectively, are observed at low, intermediate and high disorder
strengths. We observe an absence of caging and initial state dependence (except
at the intermediate disorder strength) in the study of non-equilibrium

difficulty arises from the complexity of surgical scenes and the lack of a

has shown great success in natural language processing and computer vision
communities. These approaches reduce the need for annotated data, which is
always a concern in the medical domain. However, most works on endoscopic video
understanding use models pretrained on natural images, creating a domain gap
between pretraining and finetuning. In this work, we investigate the need for
endoscopy domain-specific pretraining based on downstream objectives. To this
end, we first collect Endo700k, the largest publicly available corpus of
endoscopic images, extracted from nine public Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS)

beneficial for more complex downstream tasks, such as Action Triplet Detection,
and less effective and even unnecessary for simpler tasks, such as Surgical
Phase Recognition. We will release both our code and pretrained models upon

properties, we focus on interacting galaxies during the early stage and study
their molecular gas properties. In this study, we investigate the physical
states of a filamentary molecular structure at the overlapping region, which
was previously reported. Utilising new higher-resolution CO(J = 1-0) data, we
identify molecular clouds within overlapping and disc regions. Although the
molecular clouds in the filament have a factor of two higher an average virial
parameter (0.56+-0.14) than that in the overlapping region (0.28+-0.12) and in
the disc region (0.26+-0.16), all identified molecular clouds are
gravitationally bound. These clouds in the filament also have a larger velocity
dispersion than that in the overlapping region, suggesting that molecular gas
and/or atomic gas with different velocities collide there. We calculate the
ratio of the integrated intensity of CO(J = 3-2) and CO(J = 1-0) (= R3-2/1-0)
on the molecular cloud scale. The maximum R3-2/1-0 is 0.17+-0.04 for all
identified clouds. The R3-2/1-0 of the molecular clouds in the filament is
lower than that of the surrounding area. This result contradicts the
predictions of previous numerical simulations, which suggested that the
molecular gas on the collision front of galaxies is compressed and becomes
denser. Our results imply that NGC 4567/4568 is in a very early stage of

As compared to the local gravitational interaction, we find that the change in

move on to study the quantum gravity induced entanglement of masses for two
different scenarios. The first scenario involves treating the two test masses
as harmonic oscillators with an interaction Hamiltonian given by the aforesaid

placed in a quantum spatial superposition of two locations, based on their
respective spin states, and their entanglement being induced by the

polarization in the radio and microwaves, through local or cosmic birefringence
effects. To such polarization studies we add X-rays emanating from magnetars --
a class of neutron stars with near-critical strength magnetic fields -- that
are important targets for IXPE. ALPs produced in the neutron star core convert
to X-rays in the magnetosphere; such X-rays are polarized along the direction
parallel to the dipolar magnetic field at the point of conversion. We develop
the full theoretical formalism for ALP-induced polarization in the presence of
dipolar magnetic fields. For uncorrelated photon and ALP production mechanisms,
we completely disentangle the ALP contributions to the Stokes parameters in
terms of the ALP intensity, the ALP-to-photon conversion probability, and the
ALP-induced birefringence. In the proper limit, our results demonstrate that
the inclusion of ALPs suppresses the observed degree of circular polarization

paper reviews and evaluates six state-of-the-art compression protocols for

of the six protocols to observe their compression performance under larger
block capacities. Furthermore, extensive simulation experiments were conducted
to observe the mining behaviour when the block capacity is increased.
Experimental results reveal an interesting trade-off between volatility and
scalability. When the throughput is higher than a critical point, it worsens
the volatility and threatens Blockchain security. In the experiments, we
further analyzed the relationship between volatility and scalability properties
with respect to the distribution of transaction values. Based on the analysis
results, we proposed the recommended maximum block size for each protocol. At
last, we discuss the further improvement of the compression protocols.

rate of stochastic reorientation decreases, clusters become larger and less
numerous. Besides examining the time evolution averaged over many epidemics, we
show how the final number of ever-infected individuals depends non-trivially on

individuals first increases with the reorientation rate since particles escape
sooner from clusters and spread the disease. For higher reorientation rate,
travel between clusters becomes too diffusive and the clusters too small,

output on their first try. Motivated by how humans refine their written text,
we introduce Self-Refine, an approach for improving initial outputs from LLMs
through iterative feedback and refinement. The main idea is to generate an
initial output using an LLMs; then, the same LLMs provides feedback for its
output and uses it to refine itself, iteratively. Self-Refine does not require
any supervised training data, additional training, or reinforcement learning,
and instead uses a single LLM as the generator, refiner, and feedback provider.
We evaluate Self-Refine across 7 diverse tasks, ranging from dialog response
generation to mathematical reasoning, using state-of-the-art (GPT-3.5, ChatGPT,
and GPT-4) LLMs. Across all evaluated tasks, outputs generated with Self-Refine
are preferred by humans and automatic metrics over those generated with the
same LLM using conventional one-step generation, improving by ~20% absolute on
average in task performance. Our work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art
LLMs like GPT-4 can be further improved at test time using our simple,
standalone approach.

  coupling to optical cavities",,,,,"physics.optics cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) materials have recently emerged as a promising
platform for infrared nanophotonics. A significant challenge in the design of
ENZ-based optics is to control the dispersion of ENZ modes, which otherwise
have a flat profile near the ENZ frequency. Strong coupling with an optical
cavity is a promising approach to ENZ dispersion engineering, which however has
limitations due to the lack of tunability or nanofabrication demands of the
cavity employed. Here, we theoretically and numerically show that much of the
limitations of previous demonstrations can be overcome by strongly coupling the
ENZ mode to an unpatterned Fabry-Perot cavity. We demonstrate this
unprecedented ENZ dispersion control in coupled cavities by designing tunable
infrared polarizers that can absorb s- and reflect p-polarized components, or
vice versa, for almost any oblique angle of incidence, i.e. omnidirectional
polarizers. The feasibility of active control is also demonstrated using a
phase change material within the cavity, which predicts dynamic switchability
of polariton dispersions across multiple resonant levels at mid-infrared
wavelengths. These results are expected to advance the current understanding of
strongly coupled ENZ interactions and demonstrate their potential in tailoring
dispersions for active and passive control of light.

  Environments",,,,,"cs.AI cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Path Planning methods for autonomous control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
swarms are on the rise because of all the advantages they bring. There are more
and more scenarios where autonomous control of multiple UAVs is required. Most
of these scenarios present a large number of obstacles, such as power lines or
trees. If all UAVs can be operated autonomously, personnel expenses can be
decreased. In addition, if their flight paths are optimal, energy consumption
is reduced. This ensures that more battery time is left for other operations.
In this paper, a Reinforcement Learning based system is proposed for solving
this problem in environments with obstacles by making use of Q-Learning. This
method allows a model, in this particular case an Artificial Neural Network, to
self-adjust by learning from its mistakes and achievements. Regardless of the
size of the map or the number of UAVs in the swarm, the goal of these paths is
to ensure complete coverage of an area with fixed obstacles for tasks, like
field prospecting. Setting goals or having any prior information aside from the
provided map is not required. For experimentation, five maps of different sizes
with different obstacles were used. The experiments were performed with
different number of UAVs. For the calculation of the results, the number of
actions taken by all UAVs to complete the task in each experiment is taken into
account. The lower the number of actions, the shorter the path and the lower
the energy consumption. The results are satisfactory, showing that the system
obtains solutions in fewer movements the more UAVs there are. For a better
presentation, these results have been compared to another state-of-the-art
approach.

model contains extended, critical and localized phases for incommensurate
modulations. Our results reveal that in a substantial region inside the parent
critical phase, there is a significant increase of the superconducting critical
temperature compared to the extended phase and the uniform limit without
quasiperiodic modulations. We also analyse the results for commensurate
modulations with period close to the selected incommensurate one. We find that
while in the commensurate case, the scaling of the critical temperature with
interaction strength follows the exponentially small weak-coupling BCS
prediction for a large enough system size, it scales algebraically in the

schemes have been constructed for conservation laws. For multidimensional
problems, they offer high order accuracy at a fraction of the cost of a finite
volume WENO or DG scheme of comparable accuracy. This makes them quite
attractive for several science and engineering applications. But, to the best
of our knowledge, such schemes have not been extended to non-linear hyperbolic
systems with non-conservative products. In this paper, we perform such an
extension which improves the domain of applicability of such schemes. The
extension is carried out by writing the scheme in fluctuation form. We use the
HLLI Riemann solver of Dumbser and Balsara (2016) as a building block for
carrying out this extension. Because of the use of an HLL building block, the
resulting scheme has a proper supersonic limit. The use of anti-diffusive
fluxes ensures that stationary discontinuities can be preserved by the scheme,
thus expanding its domain of applicability. Our new finite difference WENO
formulation uses the same WENO reconstruction that was used in classical
versions, making it very easy for users to transition over to the present
formulation.
  For conservation laws, the new finite difference WENO is shown to perform as
well as the classical version of finite difference WENO, with two major
advantages:- 1) It can capture jumps in stationary linearly degenerate wave
families exactly. 2) It only requires the reconstruction to be applied once.
Several examples from hyperbolic PDE systems with non-conservative products are
shown which indicate that the scheme works and achieves its design order of
accuracy for smooth multidimensional flows. Stringent Riemann ... *Abstract

by about an order of magnitude, with comparable or better purity than past
studies. Firstly, we develop three classifiers for bright stars (BP < 16). They
are classifier-T (for Turn-off stars), classifier-GC (for Giant stars with high
completeness), and classifier-GP (for Giant stars with high purity) with
expected purity of 47%/47%/74% and completeness of 40%/94%/65% respectively.
These three classifiers obtained a total of 11,000/116,000/45,000 bright

applications, e.g., optimizing communication in distributed data placement
problems. The goal is to place all nodes across $k$ different blocks of bounded
size, such that hyperedges span as few parts as possible. This problem is
well-studied in sequential and distributed settings, but not in shared-memory.
We close this gap by devising efficient and scalable shared-memory algorithms
for all components employed in the best sequential solvers without compromises
with regards to solution quality.
  This work presents the scalable and high-quality hypergraph partitioning
framework Mt-KaHyPar. Its most important components are parallel improvement
algorithms based on the FM algorithm and maximum flows, as well as a parallel
clustering algorithm for coarsening - which are used in a multilevel scheme
with $\log(n)$ levels. As additional components, we parallelize the $n$-level
partitioning scheme, devise a deterministic version of our algorithm, and
present optimizations for plain graphs.
  We evaluate our solver on more than 800 graphs and hypergraphs, and compare
it with 25 different algorithms from the literature. Our fastest configuration
outperforms almost all existing hypergraph partitioners with regards to both
solution quality and running time. Our highest-quality configuration achieves
the same solution quality as the best sequential partitioner KaHyPar, while
being an order of magnitude faster with ten threads. Thus, two of our
configurations occupy all fronts of the Pareto curve for hypergraph
partitioning. Furthermore, our solvers exhibit good speedups, e.g., 29.6x in
the geometric mean on 64 cores (deterministic), 22.3x ($\log(n)$-level), and
25.9x ($n$-level).

the analysis of the interfacial transfer contribution to the overall mass

more powerful CMEs are launched with larger flux-rope fields (larger Bz), at
greater speeds, resulting in more sheath compression (increased number density

the second stage, the warped garment is fused with the person image to render a

strategies to improve surrogate accuracy. Firstly, component-wise domain
scaling informed by cross-validation. Secondly, regression to construct
response surfaces using additional information in the form of additional
function-values sampled from multi-fidelity models and gradients.
Component-wise domain scaling reliably improves the surrogate quality at low
dimensions but has been shown to suffer from high computational costs for
higher dimensional problems. The second strategy, adding gradients to train
surrogates, typically results in regression surrogates. Counter-intuitively,
these gradient-enhanced regression-based surrogates do not exhibit improved
accuracy compared to surrogates only interpolating function values.
  This study empirically establishes three main findings. Firstly, constructing
the surrogate in poorly scaled domains is the predominant cause of
deteriorating response surfaces when regressing with additional gradient
information. Secondly, surrogate accuracy improves if the surrogates are
constructed in a fully transformed domain, by scaling and rotating the original
domain, not just simply scaling the domain. The domain transformation scheme
should be based on the local curvature of the approximation surface and not its
global curvature. Thirdly, the main benefit of gradient information is to
efficiently determine the (near) optimal domain in which to construct the
surrogate. This study proposes a foundational transformation algorithm that
performs near-optimal transformations for lower dimensional problems. The
algorithm consistently outperforms cross-validation-based component-wise domain
scaling for higher dimensional problems. A carefully selected test problem set
that varies between 2 and 16-dimensional problems is used to clearly
demonstrate the three main findings of this study.

tolerated dose (MTD), based on safety traditionally obtained from the
clinician's perspective. While the collection of patient-reported outcomes
(PROs) has been advocated to better inform treatment tolerability, there is a
lack of guidance and methods on how to use PROs for dose assignments and
recommendations. The PRO continual reassessment method (PRO-CRM) has been
proposed to formally incorporate PROs to estimate the MTD, requiring complete
follow-up of both clinician and patient toxicity information per dose cohort to
assign the next cohort of patients. In this paper, we propose two extensions of
the PRO-CRM, allowing continuous enrollment of patients and handling longer
toxicity observation windows to capture late-onset or cumulative toxicities.
The first method, the TITE-PRO-CRM, uses a weighted likelihood to include the
partial follow-up information from PRO in estimating the MTD during and at the
end of the trial. The second method, the TITE-CRM+PRO, uses clinician's
information solely to inform dose assignments during the trial and incorporates
PRO at the end of the trial for dose recommendation. Simulation studies show
that the TITE-PRO-CRM performs similarly to the PRO-CRM in terms of dose
recommendation and assignments during the trial while reducing trial duration.
The TITE-CRM + PRO slightly underperforms compared to the TITE-PRO-CRM, but
similar performance can be attained by requiring larger sample sizes. We also
show that the proposed methods have similar performance under higher accrual
rates, different toxicity hazards, and correlated time-to-clinician toxicity
and time-to-patient toxicity data.

(XAI) is vital for making XAI algorithms follow human communication norms,
support human reasoning processes, and fulfill human needs for AI explanations.
In this position paper, we examine the most pervasive human-grounded concept in
XAI evaluation, explanation plausibility. Plausibility measures how reasonable
the machine explanation is compared to the human explanation. Plausibility has
been conventionally formulated as an important evaluation objective for AI
explainability tasks. We argue against this idea, and show how optimizing and
evaluating XAI for plausibility is sometimes harmful, and always ineffective in
achieving model understandability, transparency, and trustworthiness.
Specifically, evaluating XAI algorithms for plausibility regularizes the
machine explanation to express exactly the same content as human explanation,
which deviates from the fundamental motivation for humans to explain:
expressing similar or alternative reasoning trajectories while conforming to
understandable forms or language. Optimizing XAI for plausibility regardless of
the model decision correctness also jeopardizes model trustworthiness, because
doing so breaks an important assumption in human-human explanation that
plausible explanations typically imply correct decisions, and vice versa; and
violating this assumption eventually leads to either undertrust or overtrust of
AI models. Instead of being the end goal in XAI evaluation, plausibility can
serve as an intermediate computational proxy for the human process of
interpreting explanations to optimize the utility of XAI. We further highlight
the importance of explainability-specific evaluation objectives by
differentiating the AI explanation task from the object localization task.

In addition, neural rendering provides global consistency constraints that

However, the techniques that make weak supervision attractive -- such as
integrating any source of signal to estimate unknown labels -- also ensure that
the pseudolabels it produces are highly biased. Surprisingly, given everyday
use and the potential for increased bias, weak supervision has not been studied
from the point of view of fairness. This work begins such a study. Our
departure point is the observation that even when a fair model can be built
from a dataset with access to ground-truth labels, the corresponding dataset
labeled via weak supervision can be arbitrarily unfair. Fortunately, not all is
lost: we propose and empirically validate a model for source unfairness in weak
supervision, then introduce a simple counterfactual fairness-based technique
that can mitigate these biases. Theoretically, we show that it is possible for
our approach to simultaneously improve both accuracy and fairness metrics -- in

computation. For this reason, the development of increasingly sophisticated
error characterization and error suppression techniques is central to the
progress of quantum computing. Error distributions are considerably influenced
by the precise gate scheduling across the entire quantum processing unit. To
account for this holistic feature, we may ascribe each error profile to a
(clock) cycle, which is a scheduled list of instructions over an arbitrarily
large fraction of the chip. A celebrated technique known as randomized
compiling introduces some randomness within cycles' instructions, which yields
effective cycles with simpler, stochastic error profiles. In the present work,
we leverage the structure of cycle benchmarking (CB) circuits as well as known
Pauli channel estimation techniques to derive a method, which we refer to as
cycle error reconstruction (CER), to estimate with multiplicative precision the
marginal error distribution associated with any effective cycle of interest.
The CER protocol is designed to scale for an arbitrarily large number of
qubits. Furthermore, we develop a fast compilation-based calibration method,
referred to as stochastic calibration (SC), to identify and suppress local
coherent error sources occurring in any effective cycle of interest. We
performed both protocols on IBM-Q 5-qubit devices. Via our calibration scheme,
we obtained up to a 5-fold improvement of the circuit performance.

comparative performance assessment of image analysis methods. However, little
attention has been given to investigating what can be learnt from these

successful participation strategies? What makes a solution superior to a
competing method? To address this gap in the literature, we performed a
multi-center study with all 80 competitions that were conducted in the scope of
IEEE ISBI 2021 and MICCAI 2021. Statistical analyses performed based on
comprehensive descriptions of the submitted algorithms linked to their rank as
well as the underlying participation strategies revealed common characteristics
of winning solutions. These typically include the use of multi-task learning
(63%) and/or multi-stage pipelines (61%), and a focus on augmentation (100%),
image preprocessing (97%), data curation (79%), and postprocessing (66%). The
""typical"" lead of a winning team is a computer scientist with a doctoral
degree, five years of experience in biomedical image analysis, and four years
of experience in deep learning. Two core general development strategies stood
out for highly-ranked teams: the reflection of the metrics in the method design
and the focus on analyzing and handling failure cases. According to the
organizers, 43% of the winning algorithms exceeded the state of the art but
only 11% completely solved the respective domain problem. The insights of our
study could help researchers (1) improve algorithm development strategies when
approaching new problems, and (2) focus on open research questions revealed by
this work.

the threat posed by adversarial attacks. In this work, we build towards
addressing the challenge of adversarial robustness by exploring the
relationship between the mini-batch size used during adversarial sample
generation and the strength of the adversarial samples produced. We demonstrate
that an increase in mini-batch size results in a decrease in the efficacy of
the samples produced, and we draw connections between these observations and
the phenomenon of vanishing gradients. Next, we formulate loss functions such
that adversarial sample strength is not degraded by mini-batch size. Our
findings highlight a potential risk for underestimating the true (practical)
strength of adversarial attacks, and a risk of overestimating a model's
robustness. We share our codes to let others replicate our experiments and to
facilitate further exploration of the connections between batch size and

of hundreds of millions to billions of parameters requires the extensive use of
specialized hardware accelerators, such as GPUs, which are only accessible to a
limited number of institutions with considerable financial resources. Moreover,
there is often an alarming carbon footprint associated with training and
deploying these models. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing these
challenges by introducing BOLT, a sparse deep learning library for training
large-scale search and recommendation models on standard CPU hardware. BOLT
provides a flexible, high-level API for constructing models that will be
familiar to users of existing popular DL frameworks. By automatically tuning
specialized hyperparameters, BOLT also abstracts away the algorithmic details
of sparse network training. We evaluate BOLT on a number of information
retrieval tasks including product recommendations, text classification, graph
neural networks, and personalization. We find that our proposed system achieves
competitive performance with state-of-the-art techniques at a fraction of the
cost and energy consumption and an order-of-magnitude faster inference time.
BOLT has also been successfully deployed by multiple businesses to address
critical problems, and we highlight one customer deployment case study in the

Several models of item response theory have been proposed for different types

$\beta^3$-IRT, called $\beta^{4}$-IRT, which uses the gradient descent method
to estimate the model parameters. In $\beta^3$-IRT, abilities and difficulties
are bounded, thus we employ link functions in order to turn $\beta^{4}$-IRT
into an unconstrained gradient descent process. The original $\beta^3$-IRT had
a symmetry problem, meaning that, if an item was initialised with a
discrimination value with the wrong sign, e.g. negative when the actual
discrimination should be positive, the fitting process could be unable to
recover the correct discrimination and difficulty values for the item. In order
to tackle this limitation, we modelled the discrimination parameter as the
product of two new parameters, one corresponding to the sign and the second
associated to the magnitude. We also proposed sensible priors for all
parameters. We performed experiments to compare $\beta^{4}$-IRT and
$\beta^3$-IRT regarding parameter recovery and our new version outperformed the

transforms are viewed as a pre-processing operation separate from the actual

inputs using linear transformation are equivalent to multiplying the negative
gradient matrix with an autocorrelation matrix per training iteration. Second
order method is proposed to find the autocorrelation matrix that maximizes
learning in a given iteration. When the autocorrelation matrix is diagonal, the
method optimizes input gains. This optimal input gain (OIG) approach is used to
improve two first-order two-stage training algorithms, namely back-propagation
(BP) and hidden weight optimization (HWO), which alternately update the input
weights and solve linear equations for output weights. Results show that the
proposed OIG approach greatly enhances the performance of the first-order
algorithms, often allowing them to rival the popular Levenberg-Marquardt
approach with far less computation. It is shown that HWO is equivalent to BP
with Whitening transformation applied to the inputs. HWO effectively combines
Whitening transformation with learning. Thus, OIG improved HWO could be a

bottleneck. This means that three-phase traffic theory is a common framework
for the description of traffic states independent of whether human-driving or
automated-driving vehicles move in vehicular traffic. To prove this, we have
studied automated-driving vehicular traffic with the use of classical Helly's
model (1959) widely applied for automated vehicle motion. Although dynamic
rules of the motion of automated-driving vehicles in a road lane are
qualitatively different from those of human-driving vehicles, we have revealed
that a free-flow-to-synchronized-flow transition (F$\rightarrow$S transition)
exhibits the nucleation nature, which was observed in empirical field data
measured in traffic consisting of 100% human-driving vehicles. The physics of
the nucleation nature of the F$\rightarrow$S transition in automated-driving
traffic is associated with a discontinuity in the rate of lane-changing that
causes the discontinuity in the rate of over-acceleration. This discontinuous
character of over-acceleration leads to both the existence and self-maintaining
of synchronized flow at the bottleneck in automated-driving vehicular traffic
as well as to the existence at any time instant of a range of highway
capacities between some minimum and maximum capacities. Within the capacity
range, an F$\rightarrow$S transition can be induced; however, when the maximum

impactors is found to be insignificant. Asteroids produced most large impacts
on the terrestrial worlds in the last $\simeq 3$ Gyr. The great majority of
early impactors were rocky planetesimals left behind at $\sim 0.5$--1.5 au
after the terrestrial planet accretion. The population of terrestrial
planetesimals was reduced by disruptive collisions in the first $t \sim 20$ Myr

crucial to characterize their magnetic behavior, and in particular the
isotropic magnetic exchange coupling, J, between its magnetic centers. Due to
the large size of typical MCTMs, density functional theory (DFT) is the only
practical electronic structure method for evaluating the J coupling. Here we
assess the accuracy of different density functional approximations for
predicting the magnetic couplings of seven di-metal transition metal complexes
with known reliable experimental J couplings spanning from ferromagnetic to
strong antiferromagnetic. The density functionals considered include global
hybrid functionals which mix semilocal density functional approximations and
exact exchange with a fixed admixing parameter, six local hybrid functionals
where the admixing parameters are extended to be spatially dependent, the SCAN

which are not is crucial for the accurate interpretation of astronomical data.
In particular, for the multidimensional Gaia data, filters and cuts on
different parameters or measurements introduces a selection function that may
unintentionally alter scientific conclusions in subtle ways. We aim to develop
a methodology to estimate the selection function for different sub-samples of
stars in the Gaia catalogue. Comparing the number of stars in a given
sub-sample to those in the overall Gaia catalogue, provides an estimate of the
sub-sample membership probability, as a function of sky position, magnitude and
colour. This estimate must differentiate the stochastic absence of sub-sample
stars from selection effects. When multiplied with the overall Gaia catalogue
selection function this provides the total selection function of the
sub-sample. We present the method by estimating the selection function of the
sources in Gaia DR3 with heliocentric radial velocity measurements. We also
compute the selection function for the stars in the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus
sample, confirming that the apparent asymmetry of its debris across the sky is
merely caused by selection effects. The developed method estimates the
selection function of the stars present in a sub-sample of Gaia data, given
that the sub-sample is completely contained in the Gaia parent catalogue (for
which the selection function is known). This tool is made available in a
GaiaUnlimited Python package.

a fair representation learning module by progressively learning the behaviors

insufficient that the nominal utilization at each server is below 100%. Certain
policies, although work conserving, may destabilize a network that satisfies
the nominal load conditions; additional conditions on the primitives are needed
for global stability. The global-stability region was fully characterized for
two-station networks in [13], but a general framework for networks with more
than two stations remains elusive. In this paper, we offer progress on this
front by considering a subset of non-idling control policies, namely
queue-ratio (QR) policies. These include as special cases also all
static-priority policies. With this restriction, we are able to introduce a
complete framework that applies to networks of any size. Our framework breaks
the analysis of QR-global stability into (i) global state-space collapse and
(ii) global stability of the Skorohod problem (SP) representing the fluid
workload. Sufficient conditions for both are specified in terms of simple
optimization problems. We use these optimization problems to prove that the
family of QR policies satisfies a weak form of convexity relative to policies.
A direct implication of this convexity is that: if the SP is stable for all
static-priority policies (the ""extreme"" QR policies), then it is also stable
under any QR policy. While QR-global stability is weaker than global stability,
our framework recovers necessary and sufficient conditions for global stability
in specific networks.

century Persian mathematician Sharaf al-Din Tusi, together with Smale's theory

high-precision approximation to a real root of an arbitrary real cubic
equation. First, via reversible transformations we reduce any real cubic
equation into one of four canonical forms with $0$, $\pm 1$ coefficients,
except for the constant term as $\pm q$, $q \geq 0$. Next, given any form, if
$\rho_q$ is an approximation to $\sqrt[3]{q}$ to within a relative error of
five percent, we prove a {\it seed} $x_0$ in $\{ \rho_q, \pm .95 \rho_q,
-\frac{1}{3}, 1 \}$ can be selected such that in $t$ Newton iterations $|x_t -
\theta_q| \leq \sqrt[3]{q}\cdot 2^{-2^{t}}$ for some real root $\theta_q$.
While computing a good seed, even for approximation of $\sqrt[3]{q}$, is
considered to be ``somewhat of black art'' (see Wikipedia), as we justify,
$\rho_q$ is readily computable from {\it mantissa} and {\it exponent} of $q$.
It follows that the above approach gives a simple recipe for numerical

found that the images are generally affected by various rainwater artifacts
such as raindrops, rain streaks, and rainy haze, which impact the image quality
from both near and far distances, resulting in a complex and intertwined
process of image degradation. However, current deraining techniques are limited
in their ability to address only one or two types of rainwater, which poses a
challenge in removing the mixture of rain (MOR). In this study, we propose an
effective image deraining paradigm for Mixture of rain REmoval, called
DEMore-Net, which takes full account of the MOR effect. Going beyond the
existing deraining wisdom, DEMore-Net is a joint learning paradigm that
integrates depth estimation and MOR removal tasks to achieve superior rain
removal. The depth information can offer additional meaningful guidance
information based on distance, thus better helping DEMore-Net remove different
types of rainwater. Moreover, this study explores normalization approaches in
image deraining tasks and introduces a new Hybrid Normalization Block (HNB) to
enhance the deraining performance of DEMore-Net. Extensive experiments
conducted on synthetic datasets and real-world MOR photos fully validate the
superiority of the proposed DEMore-Net. Code is available at

learnable priors, but also quantifies the associated uncertainty. Furthermore,
the ultimate complexity is well controlled regardless of the inner-level

selecting convolution kernel sizes that correspond to most prominent features.
Inspired by the diffusion models, our method uses a novel iterative refinement
process that gradually shifts the embedding spaces from different sources to a
single canonical space for better metric learning. In addition, we present
CS-Campus3D, the first 3D aerial-ground cross-source dataset consisting of
point cloud data from both aerial and ground LiDAR scans. The point clouds in
CS-Campus3D have representation gaps and other features like different views,

great success in code generation. ICL does not require training. PTLMs take as
the input a prompt consisting of a few requirement-code examples and a new
requirement, and output a new program. However, existing studies simply reuse
ICL techniques for natural language generation and ignore unique features of
code generation. We refer to these studies as standard ICL.
  Inspired by observations of the human coding process, we propose a novel ICL
approach for code generation named AceCoder. Compared to standard ICL, AceCoder
has two novelties. (1) Example retrieval. It retrieves similar programs as
examples and learns programming skills (e.g., algorithms, APIs) from them. (2)
Guided Code Generation. It encourages PTLMs to output an intermediate
preliminary (e.g., test cases, APIs) before generating programs. The
preliminary can help PTLMs understand requirements and guide the next code
generation. We apply AceCoder to six PTLMs (e.g., Codex) and evaluate it on
three public benchmarks using the Pass@k. Results show that AceCoder can
significantly improve the performance of PTLMs on code generation. (1) In terms
of Pass@1, AceCoder outperforms standard ICL by up to 79.7% and fine-tuned
models by up to 171%. (2) AceCoder is effective in PTLMs with different sizes

model pre-trained on labeled source data to a target domain with only unlabeled
target data. SOSR leverages the source model to generate refined pseudo-labels
for teacher-student learning. To better utilize the pseudo-labels, this paper
proposes a novel wavelet-based augmentation method, named Wavelet Augmentation
Transformer (WAT), which can be flexibly incorporated with existing networks,
to implicitly produce useful augmented data. WAT learns low-frequency
information of varying levels across diverse samples, which is aggregated
efficiently via deformable attention. Furthermore, an uncertainty-aware
self-training mechanism is proposed to improve the accuracy of pseudo-labels,
with inaccurate predictions being rectified by uncertainty estimation. To
acquire better SR results and avoid overfitting pseudo-labels, several
regularization losses are proposed to constrain the frequency information
between target LR and SR images. Experiments show that without accessing source
data, SOSR achieves superior results to the state-of-the-art UDA methods.

response functions we query the material response of disparate active systems
composed of actin filaments and myosin motors, from model fluids to living

this method which measures response functions from experimental observations of

widespread use of PLMs and the impressive performance in a broad range of NLP
tasks, there is a lack of a clear and well-justified need to as why these

represent solitons of the GNLSE, and this allows us to study the existence and
organization of solitons with advanced numerical tools for the detection and
continuation of connecting orbits. In this way, we establish the existence of
connections from one periodic orbit to another, called PtoP connections. They
give rise to families of homoclinic orbits to either of the two periodic
orbits; in the GNLSE they correspond to generalized solitons with oscillating
tails whose amplitude does not decay but reaches a nonzero limit. Moreover,
PtoP connections can be found in the energy level of the origin, where
connections between this equilibrium and a given periodic orbit, called EtoP
connections, are known to organize families of solitons. As we show here, EtoP
and PtoP cycles can be assembled into different types of heteroclinic cycles
that give rise to additional families of homoclinic orbits to the origin. In
the GNLSE, these correspond to multi-oscillation solitons that feature several
episodes of different oscillations in between their decaying tails. As for
solitons organized by EtoP connections only, multi-oscillation solitons are
shown to be an integral part of the phenomenon of truncated homoclinic snaking.

GPT-3.5 (February 2023) and GPT-4 (March 2023) models answered 340 questions

evaluated five times in an initialized session. Results: GPT-3.5 and GPT-4

83.75% accuracy for neuropsychiatry compared to 28.75% for internal medicine

questions but struggled with intervention-based ones. The accuracy for
questions that require TKM-specialized knowledge was relatively lower than the
accuracy for questions that do not GPT-4 showed high accuracy for table-based
questions, and both models demonstrated consistent responses. A positive

in this study showed near-passing performance in decision-making for TKM

believed to be caused by culturally-biased learning. Our study suggests that
foundation models have potential in culturally-adapted medicine, specifically

  Annotations","10 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  With the rapid accumulation of text data produced by data-driven techniques,
the task of extracting ""data annotations""--concise, high-quality data summaries
from unstructured raw text--has become increasingly important. The recent
advances in weak supervision and crowd-sourcing techniques provide promising
solutions to efficiently create annotations (labels) for large-scale technical
text data. However, such annotations may fail in practice because of the change
in annotation requirements, application scenarios, and modeling goals, where
label validation and relabeling by domain experts are required. To approach
this issue, we present LabelVizier, a human-in-the-loop workflow that
incorporates domain knowledge and user-specific requirements to reveal
actionable insights into annotation flaws, then produce better-quality labels
for large-scale multi-label datasets. We implement our workflow as an
interactive notebook to facilitate flexible error profiling, in-depth
annotation validation for three error types, and efficient annotation
relabeling on different data scales. We evaluated the efficiency and
generalizability of our workflow with two use cases and four expert reviews.
The results indicate that LabelVizier is applicable in various application
scenarios and assist domain experts with different knowledge backgrounds to
efficiently improve technical text annotation quality.

model introduced in [1] as a low-energy approximation to two-color QCD.
Restricting to the spin-0 sector of the model, we unearth an unexpected
tetrahedral symmetry, which endows the dynamics with an extraordinarily rich
structure. Amongst other things, we find that the spin-0 sector contains
co-existing chaotic sub-sectors as well as nested chaotic basins, and displays
alternation between regular and chaotic dynamics as energy is varied. The
symmetries also grant us a considerable amount of analytic control which allows
us to make several quantitative observations. Next, by noting that several
features of the model have natural thermodynamic interpretations, we switch
from our original chaos-theoretic viewpoint to a more statistical perspective.
By so doing, we see that the classical spin-0 sector has a rich phase
structure, arising from ergodicity breaking, which we investigate in depth.
Surprisingly, we find that many of these classical phases display numerous
similarities to previously discovered quantum phases of the spin-0 sector [2],
and we explore these similarities in a heuristic fashion.

thus formulate an adaptive algorithm which monitors the level of error and
adapts the number of (unrolled) implicit solution iterations during the

the current learning loss. This helps accelerate training, while maintaining
accuracy. Several numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the
advantages of the proposed algorithm compared to nonadaptive unrollings, and
validate the theoretical analysis. We also note that this approach naturally

conventional Pitzer-Debye-H\""uckel (PDH) equation is compared to two of its
new, thermodynamically consistent extensions. Both development stages, the
extended PDH term and the modified-extended PDH, account for concentration
dependent mixture properties instead of using solvent properties. The latter
one additionally introduces a modified parameter of closest approach which
improves the overall performance of the model for high electrolyte
concentrations in systems with variable or low permittivities. To account for
the short-range interactions, these long-range models are coupled with the
UNIversal QUAsi-Chemical (UNIQUAC) model. Three modeling strategies were tested
for the short-range contribution. First, the UNIQUAC parameters were adjusted
to each system individually, then the binary interaction parameters were the
same for each binary interaction type for all the systems and lastly a linear
function of the carbon number was used where possible. For all systems and all
modeling strategies tested, the predictive performance increased from PDH to
E-PDH and then to ME-PDH. Overall, an introduction of concentration dependent
properties and the modification added to ME-PDH enhanced modeling performance
when describing these systems, showing the general applicability of this novel

the gap, we introduce a new perspective of input-agnostic saliency mapping that
computationally estimates the high-level features attributed by the model to

accumulating model's gradient information with respect to an unrestricted data

the model loss surface towards the local minima associated by a
human-understandable concept, e.g., class label for classifiers. With a
systematic projection, scaling and refinement process, this information is
transformed into an interpretable visualization without compromising its

images do. Hence, owing to the difficulty of applying inductive biases, OCL for
single-view images remains challenging, resulting in inconsistent learning of
object-centric representation. To this end, we introduce a novel OCL framework
for single-view images, SLot Attention via SHepherding (SLASH), which consists
of two simple-yet-effective modules on top of Slot Attention. The new modules,
Attention Refining Kernel (ARK) and Intermediate Point Predictor and Encoder
(IPPE), respectively, prevent slots from being distracted by the background
noise and indicate locations for slots to focus on to facilitate learning of
object-centric representation. We also propose a weak semi-supervision approach
for OCL, whilst our proposed framework can be used without any assistant
annotation during the inference. Experiments show that our proposed method
enables consistent learning of object-centric representation and achieves
strong performance across four datasets. Code is available at

  nonparametrics",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Completely random measures (CRMs) provide a broad class of priors, arguably,
the most popular, for Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) analysis of trait
allocations. As a peculiar property, CRM priors lead to predictive
distributions that share the following common structure: for fixed prior's
parameters, a new data point exhibits a Poisson (random) number of ``new''
traits, i.e., not appearing in the sample, which depends on the sampling
information only through the sample size. While the Poisson posterior
distribution is appealing for analytical tractability and ease of
interpretation, its independence from the sampling information is a critical
drawback, as it makes the posterior distribution of ``new'' traits completely
determined by the estimation of the unknown prior's parameters. In this paper,
we introduce the class of transform-scaled process (T-SP) priors as a tool to
enrich the posterior distribution of ``new'' traits arising from CRM priors,
while maintaining the same analytical tractability and ease of interpretation.
In particular, we present a framework for posterior analysis of trait
allocations under T-SP priors, showing that Stable T-SP priors, i.e., T-SP
priors built from Stable CRMs, lead to predictive distributions such that, for
fixed prior's parameters, a new data point displays a negative-Binomial
(random) number of ``new'' traits, which depends on the sampling information
through the number of distinct traits and the sample size. Then, by relying on
a hierarchical version of T-SP priors, we extend our analysis to the more
general setting of trait allocations with multiple groups of data or
subpopulations. The empirical effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated
through numerical experiments and applications to real data.

using CNN and ConvLSTM feature learning pipelines on a dataset obtained with a
single accelerometer (WISDM) and another obtained using the fusion of
accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers (PAMAP2) under various sliding

similar quality features and outperformed the baselines and existing models

populations where data sources are based on lists of known cases. A typical
modelling approach is to fit a Poisson loglinear model to the numbers of cases
observed in each possible combination of the lists. It is necessary to decide
which interaction parameters to include in the model, and information criterion
approaches are often used for model selection. Difficulties in the context of
multiple systems estimation may arise due to sparse or nil counts based on the
intersection of lists, and care must be taken when information criterion
approaches are used for model selection due to issues relating to the existence
of estimates and identifiability of the model. Confidence intervals are often
reported conditional on the model selected, providing an over-optimistic
impression of the accuracy of the estimation.
  A bootstrap approach is a natural way to account for the model selection
procedure. However, because the model selection step has to be carried out for
every bootstrap replication, there may be a high or even prohibitive
computational burden. We explore the merit of modifying the model selection
procedure in the bootstrap to look only among a subset of models, chosen on the
basis of their information criterion score on the original data. This provides
large computational gains with little apparent effect on inference. Another
model selection approach considered and investigated is a downhill search
approach among models, possibly with multiple starting points.

possible states (cold or hot) are assumed in the hidden Markov chains of
events, and the probability of success for each throw is modelled by
considering both the corresponding hidden state and the distance to the basket.

lightcone ansatz for self-dual gravity (along with linearized anti-self-dual
perturbations) in the Poincare patch of de Sitter space. The only interaction
vertices are cubic ones, found previously by Metsaev in a bottom-up lightcone
approach. We point out a special feature of these vertices, which leads to
""almost conservation"" of energy at each successive order in perturbation
theory, despite the time-dependent de Sitter background. Since we embed the
lightcone variables into a full spacetime metric, the solutions have a clear
geometric interpretation. In particular, this allows us to read off boundary
data on both the past and future horizons of a causal (static) patch. In this
way, we add self-dual GR to the program of defining & computing scattering
amplitudes in a causal patch of de Sitter space.

keyword detection or radar-based gesture recognition are heavily constrained by
the limited memory on such tiny devices because DNN inference requires large
intermediate run-time buffers to store activations and other intermediate data,
which leads to high memory usage. In this paper, we propose a new Fused
Depthwise Tiling (FDT) method for the memory optimization of DNNs, which,
compared to existing tiling methods, reduces memory usage without inducing any
run time overhead. FDT applies to a larger variety of network layers than
existing tiling methods that focus on convolutions. It improves TinyML memory
optimization significantly by reducing memory of models where this was not
possible before and additionally providing alternative design points for models
that show high run time overhead with existing methods. In order to identify
the best tiling configuration, an end-to-end flow with a new path discovery
method is proposed, which applies FDT and existing tiling methods in a fully
automated way, including the scheduling of the operations and planning of the
layout of buffers in memory. Out of seven evaluated models, FDT achieved
significant memory reduction for two models by 76.2% and 18.1% where existing
tiling methods could not be applied. Two other models showed a significant run

they are still not suitable to be applied to real scenarios and generate value

batteries is motivated by the fact that real-world quantum systems are almost
never perfectly isolated from their environment. One important challenge in the
study of open quantum batteries is to develop theoretical models that
accurately capture the complex interactions between the battery and its
environment. the goal of studying open quantum batteries is to develop
practical methods for building and operating quantum devices that can store and
release energy with high efficiency and reliability, even in the presence of
environmental noise and other sources of decoherence. The charging process of

the workers frequently upload local gradients to the server via

principle component analysis (PCA) is leveraged to reduce the dimension of
uploaded gradients such that the communication bottleneck is relieved. A
PCA-based wireless federated learning (PCA-WFL) algorithm and its accelerated
version (i.e., PCA-AWFL) are proposed based on the low-dimensional gradients
and the Nesterov's momentum. For the non-convex loss functions, a finite-time

convergence of the PCA-WFL and PCA-AWFL algorithms. The PCA-AWFL algorithm is
theoretically certified to converge faster than the PCA-WFL algorithm. Besides,
the convergence rates of PCA-WFL and PCA-AWFL algorithms quantitatively reveal
the linear speedup with respect to the number of workers over the vanilla

improved convergence rates of the proposed PCA-WFL and PCA-AWFL algorithms over

  heterostructure","32 pages, 4 main figures, 5 supplemental figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Excitons are two-particle correlated bound states that are formed due to
Coulomb interaction between single-particle holes and electrons. In the
solid-state, cooperative interactions with surrounding quasiparticles can
strongly tailor the exciton properties and potentially even create new
correlated states of matter. It is thus highly desirable to access such
cooperative and correlated exciton behavior on a fundamental level. Here, we
find that the ultrafast transfer of an exciton's hole across a type-II
band-aligned moir\'e heterostructure leads to a surprising sub-200-fs upshift
of the single-particle energy of the electron being photoemitted from the
two-particle exciton state. While energy relaxation usually leads to an
energetic downshift of the spectroscopic signature, we show that this unusual
upshift is a clear fingerprint of the correlated interactions of the electron
and hole parts of the exciton quasiparticle. In this way, time-resolved
photoelectron spectroscopy is straightforwardly established as a powerful
method to access exciton correlations and cooperative behavior in
two-dimensional quantum materials. Our work highlights this new capability and
motivates the future study of optically inaccessible correlated excitonic and
electronic states in moir\'e heterostructures.

continuous-time linear time-invariant system subject to continuous-time path
constraints on the states and the inputs. By leveraging the concept of
differential flatness, we can replace the differential equations governing the
system with linear mapping between the states, inputs, and flat outputs

piecewise polynomials, and the model predictive control problem can be
equivalently transformed into a Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) problem via
Sum-of-Squares (SOS), ensuring constraint satisfaction at every continuous-time

small-size semi-definite matrices as optimization variables. To address this,
we develop a Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) algorithm that can be
efficiently parallelized to speed up the optimization procedure. Simulation
results on a quadruple-tank process demonstrate that our formulation can
guarantee strict constraint satisfaction, while the standard MPC controller

information regarding surface shape, material, illumination and viewing
geometry. The computer vision community has witnessed a blossom of
polarization-based vision applications, such as reflection removal,
shape-from-polarization, transparent object segmentation and color constancy,
partially due to the emergence of single-chip mono/color polarization sensors
that make polarization data acquisition easier than ever. However, is
polarization-based vision vulnerable to adversarial attacks? If so, is that
possible to realize these adversarial attacks in the physical world, without
being perceived by human eyes? In this paper, we warn the community of the
vulnerability of polarization-based vision, which can be more serious than
RGB-based vision. By adapting a commercial LCD projector, we achieve locally
controllable polarizing projection, which is successfully utilized to fool
state-of-the-art polarization-based vision algorithms for glass segmentation
and color constancy. Compared with existing physical attacks on RGB-based
vision, which always suffer from the trade-off between attack efficacy and eye
conceivability, the adversarial attackers based on polarizing projection are
contact-free and visually imperceptible, since naked human eyes can rarely
perceive the difference of viciously manipulated polarizing light and ordinary
illumination. This poses unprecedented risks on polarization-based vision, both
in the monochromatic and trichromatic domain, for which due attentions should
be paid and counter measures be considered.

Here we propose novel imputation methods based on determinantal point processes

quality of the imputed data demonstrated by increased accuracy of the
downstream classification; and providing deterministic and reliable imputations
that remove the variance from the classification results. We experimentally
demonstrate the advantages of our methods by performing extensive imputations
on synthetic and real clinical data. We also develop quantum circuits for
implementing determinantal point processes, since such quantum algorithms
provide a computational advantage with respect to classical ones. We
demonstrate competitive results with up to ten qubits for small-scale
imputation tasks on a state-of-the-art IBM quantum processor. Our classical and

disks and planets are widely separated both in space and time. The 5 Myr PDS 70
systems offers a unique opportunity to directly compare the chemistry of a
giant planet's atmosphere to the chemistry of its natal disk. To that end, we
derive our current best physical and chemical model for the PDS 70 disk through
forward modelling of the $^{12}$CO, C$^{18}$O, and C$_2$H emission radial
profiles with the thermochemical code DALI and find a volatile C/O ratio above
unity in the outer disk. Using what we know of the PDS 70 disk today, we
analytically estimate the properties of the disk as it was 4 Myr in the past
when we assume that the giant planets started their formation, and compute a
chemical model of the disk at that time. We compute the formation of PDS 70b
and PDS 70c using the standard core accretion paradigm and account for the
accretion of volatile and refractory sources of carbon and oxygen to estimate
the resulting atmospheric carbon-to-oxygen number ratio (C/O) for these
planets. Our inferred C/O ratio of the gas in the PDS 70 disk indicates that it
is marginally carbon rich relative to the stellar C/O = 0.44 which we derive
from an empirical relation between stellar metallicity and C/O. Under the
assumption that the disk has been carbon rich for most of its lifetime, we find
that the planets acquire a super-stellar C/O in their atmospheres. If the
carbon-rich disk is a relatively recent phenomenon (i.e. developed after the
formation of the planets at $\sim 1$ Myr) then the planets should have close to
the stellar C/O in their atmospheres. This work lays the groundwork to better
understand the disk in the PDS 70 system as well as the planet formation
scenario that produce its planets.

its immersiveness, supporting multiuser Virtual Experiences (VEs), and enabling
users to move freely within their VEs while remaining confined to specialized
VR setups through Redirected Walking (RDW). To meet their extreme data-rate and
latency requirements, future VR systems will require supporting wireless
networking infrastructures operating in millimeter Wave (mmWave) frequencies
that leverage highly directional communication in both transmission and
reception through beamforming and beamsteering. We propose the use of
predictive context-awareness to optimize transmitter and receiver-side
beamforming and beamsteering. By predicting users' short-term lateral movements
in multiuser VR setups with Redirected Walking (RDW), transmitter-side
beamforming and beamsteering can be optimized through Line-of-Sight (LoS)
""tracking"" in the users' directions. At the same time, predictions of
short-term orientational movements can be utilized for receiver-side
beamforming for coverage flexibility enhancements. We target two open problems
in predicting these two context information instances: i) predicting lateral
movements in multiuser VR settings with RDW, and ii) generating synthetic head
rotation datasets for training orientational movements predictors. Our
experimental results demonstrate that Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
feature promising accuracy in predicting lateral movements, and
context-awareness stemming from VEs further enhances this accuracy.
Additionally, we show that a TimeGAN-based approach for orientational data
generation can create synthetic samples that closely match experimentally
obtained ones.

general, birth and death rates depend on the system size (corresponding to the

vary every time birth or death occurs, which makes fluctuations in the rates
inevitable. The differential-difference equation governing the time evolution
of such a birth-death process is well established, but it resists solving for a

expression for counting statistics of products (or customers). We further
examine the relationship between the system size fluctuations and the birth and

of the system size are determined by the mean death rate as well as the
covariance of the system size and the net growth rate (i.e., the birth rate

Our findings reveal that complex topologies lead to superior performance in

advantage is attributed to the ability of complex networks to exploit the
compositionality of the underlying target function. However, this benefit comes
at the cost of increased forward-pass computation time and reduced robustness

assigned to the band structure by the momentum matrix elements and energy
differences for the magnetic ground state (A-AFM). In addition, our study
reveals significant differences in electronic properties for two different
interlayer magnetic phases. When the magnetic ordering of A-AFM to FM is
changed, the crucial modification of the band structure reflected in the
direct-to-indirect band gap transition and the significant splitting of the
conduction bands along the $\Gamma-Z$ direction are obtained. In addition,
Raman measurements demonstrate a splitting between the in-plane modes
$B^2_{2g}$/$B^2_{3g}$, which is temperature dependent and can be assigned to
different interlayer magnetic states, corroborated by the DFT+U study.
Moreover, the $B^2_{2g}$ mode has not been experimentally observed before.

practical approach to black-box computational design problems for which the
true objective function is unknown and expensive to query. However, the
standard approach which optimizes designs against a learned proxy model of the
ground truth objective can suffer from distributional shift. Specifically, in
high-dimensional design spaces where valid designs lie on a narrow manifold,
the standard approach is susceptible to producing out-of-distribution, invalid
designs that ""fool"" the learned proxy model into outputting a high value. Using
an ensemble rather than a single model as the learned proxy can help mitigate
distribution shift, but naive formulations for combining gradient information
from the ensemble, such as minimum or mean gradient, are still suboptimal and
often hampered by non-convergent behavior.
  In this work, we explore alternate approaches for combining gradient
information from the ensemble that are robust to distribution shift without
compromising optimality of the produced designs. More specifically, we explore
two functions, formulated as convex optimization problems, for combining
gradient information: multiple gradient descent algorithm (MGDA) and
conflict-averse gradient descent (CAGrad). We evaluate these algorithms on a
diverse set of five computational design tasks. We compare performance of
ensemble MBO with MGDA and ensemble MBO with CAGrad with three naive baseline
algorithms: (a) standard single-model MBO, (b) ensemble MBO with mean gradient,
and (c) ensemble MBO with minimum gradient.
  Our results suggest that MGDA and CAGrad strike a desirable balance between
conservatism and optimality and can help robustify data-driven offline MBO

We present a machine learning approach to emulate the hydrodynamical simulation
of intergalactic medium physics for the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest called LyAl-Net.
The main goal of this work is to provide highly efficient and cheap simulations
retaining interpretation abilities about the gas field level, and as a tool for
other cosmological exploration. We use a neural network based on the U-net
architecture, a variant of convolutional neural networks, to predict the
neutral hydrogen physical properties, density, and temperature. We train the
LyAl-Net model with the Horizon-noAGN simulation, though using only 9% of the
volume. We also explore the resilience of the model through tests of a transfer
learning framework using cosmological simulations containing different baryonic
feedback. We test our results by analysing one and two-point statistics of
emulated fields in different scenarios, as well as their stochastic properties.
The ensemble average of the emulated Lyman-$\alpha$ forest absorption as a
function of redshift lies within 2.5% of one derived from the full
hydrodynamical simulation. The computation of individual fields from the dark
matter density agrees well with regular physical regimes of cosmological
fields. The results tested on IllustrisTNG100 showed a drastic improvement in

implementing only local policies which can be run independently and even on

learning approach which has emerged as an effective way to address privacy
concerns by only sharing local AI models while keeping the data decentralized.
Two critical challenges of Federated Learning are managing the heterogeneous
systems in the same federated network and dealing with real data, which are
often not independently and identically distributed (non-IID) among the
clients. In this paper, we focus on the second problem, i.e., the problem of
statistical heterogeneity of the data in the same federated network. In this
setting, local models might be strayed far from the local optimum of the
complete dataset, thus possibly hindering the convergence of the federated
model. Several Federated Learning algorithms, such as FedAvg, FedProx and
Federated Curvature (FedCurv), aiming at tackling the non-IID setting, have
already been proposed. This work provides an empirical assessment of the
behaviour of FedAvg and FedCurv in common non-IID scenarios. Results show that
the number of epochs per round is an important hyper-parameter that, when tuned
appropriately, can lead to significant performance gains while reducing the

learning. We believe the capability of generative adversarial network (GAN)
suits the need of machine audio anomaly detection, yet rarely has this been
investigated by previous work. In this paper, we propose AEGAN-AD, a totally
unsupervised approach in which the generator (also an autoencoder) is trained
to reconstruct input spectrograms. It is pointed out that the denoising nature
of reconstruction deprecates its capacity. Thus, the discriminator is
redesigned to aid the generator during both training stage and detection stage.
The performance of AEGAN-AD on the dataset of DCASE 2022 Challenge TASK 2

training has been floating around the deep learning world. Given that most
training is currently conducted with entire networks in FP32, or sometimes FP16
with mixed-precision, the step to having some parts of a network run in FP8
with 8-bit weights is an appealing potential speed-up for the generally costly
and time-intensive training procedures in deep learning. A natural question
arises regarding what this development means for efficient inference on edge
devices. In the efficient inference device world, workloads are frequently
executed in INT8. Sometimes going even as low as INT4 when efficiency calls for
it. In this whitepaper, we compare the performance for both the FP8 and INT
formats for efficient on-device inference. We theoretically show the difference
between the INT and FP formats for neural networks and present a plethora of
post-training quantization and quantization-aware-training results to show how
this theory translates to practice. We also provide a hardware analysis showing
that the FP formats are somewhere between 50-180% less efficient in terms of
compute in dedicated hardware than the INT format. Based on our research and a
read of the research field, we conclude that although the proposed FP8 format
could be good for training, the results for inference do not warrant a
dedicated implementation of FP8 in favor of INT8 for efficient inference. We
show that our results are mostly consistent with previous findings but that
important comparisons between the formats have thus far been lacking. Finally,
we discuss what happens when FP8-trained networks are converted to INT8 and
conclude with a brief discussion on the most efficient way for on-device
deployment and an extensive suite of INT8 results for many models.

directly compute the policy gradient from a bath of persistently exciting data.
Next, we show that the nonconvex PO problem satisfies a projected gradient

the global convergence of DeePO. Moreover, we apply regularization methods to
enhance certainty-equivalence and robustness of the resulting controller and
show an implicit regularization property. Finally, we perform simulations to

early superhumps and ordinary superhumps originating from the 2:1 and 3:1

lacking early superhumps; it is not well established how these differ from
superoutbursts with an early superhump phase. We report time-resolved
photometric observations of the WZ Sge-type DN V627 Peg during its 2021
superoutburst. The detection of ordinary superhumps before the superoutburst
peak highlights that this 2021 superoutburst of V627 Peg, like that {in} 2014,
did not feature an early superhump phase. The duration of stage B superhumps
was slightly longer in the 2010 superoutburst accompanying early superhumps
than that in the 2014 and 2021 superoutbursts which lacked early superhumps.
This result suggests that an accretion disk experiencing the 2:1 resonance may
have a larger mass at the inner part of the disk and hence take more time for
the inner disk to become eccentric. The presence of a precursor outburst in the
2021 superoutburst suggests that the maximum disk radius should be smaller than
that of the 2014 superoutburst, even though the duration of quiescence was
longer than that before the 2021 superoutburst. This could be accomplished if
the 2021 superoutburst was triggered as an inside-out outburst or if the mass
transfer rate in quiescence changes by a factor of two, suggesting that the
outburst mechanism and quiescence state of WZ Sge-type DNe may have more
variety than ever thought.

we introduce a new framework for graph convolutional networks called Hybrid
Diffusion-based Graph Convolutional Network (HD-GCN) to address the limitations
of information diffusion caused by the adjacency matrix. In the HD-GCN
framework, we initially utilize diffusion maps to facilitate the diffusion of
information among nodes that are adjacent to each other in the feature space.
This allows for the diffusion of information between similar points that may
not have an adjacent relationship. Next, we utilize graph convolution to
further propagate information among adjacent nodes after the diffusion maps,
thereby enabling the spread of information among similar nodes that are
adjacent in the graph. Finally, we employ the diffusion distances obtained
through the use of diffusion maps to regularize and constrain the predicted
labels of training nodes. This regularization method is then applied to the
HD-GCN training, resulting in a smoother classification surface. The model
proposed in this paper effectively overcomes the limitations of information
diffusion imposed only by the adjacency matrix. HD-GCN utilizes hybrid
diffusion by combining information diffusion between neighborhood nodes in the
feature space and adjacent nodes in the adjacency matrix. This method allows
for more comprehensive information propagation among nodes, resulting in
improved model performance. We evaluated the performance of DM-GCN on three
well-known citation network datasets and the results showed that the proposed

address these two limitations at the same time. Hence, in our work, we proposed
a novel shape prior module (SPM), which can explicitly introduce shape priors
to promote the segmentation performance of UNet-based models. The explicit
shape priors consist of global and local shape priors. The former with coarse
shape representations provides networks with capabilities to model global

to boost the segmentation performance, which relieves the heavy dependence on
the learnable prototype in the segmentation head. To evaluate the effectiveness

the tangent vector fields of the worldsheet lie in $\ker \mathrm{d}\eta$. In
the special case that the almost contact structure becomes a contact structure,
its Reeb vector field completely characterizes the worldsheet. We apply our

in recent years. Compared to single-agent settings, the exponential dimension
growth of the joint state-action space in multi-agent systems dramatically
increases the complexity of the environment dynamics, which makes it infeasible
to learn an accurate global model and thus necessitates the use of agent-wise
local models. However, during multi-step model rollouts, the prediction of one
local model can affect the predictions of other local models in the next step.
As a result, local prediction errors can be propagated to other localities and
eventually give rise to considerably large global errors. Furthermore, since
the models are generally used to predict for multiple steps, simply minimizing
one-step prediction errors regardless of their long-term effect on other models
may further aggravate the propagation of local errors. To this end, we propose
Models as AGents (MAG), a multi-agent model optimization framework that
reversely treats the local models as multi-step decision making agents and the
current policies as the dynamics during the model rollout process. In this way,
the local models are able to consider the multi-step mutual affect between each
other before making predictions. Theoretically, we show that the objective of
MAG is approximately equivalent to maximizing a lower bound of the true
environment return. Experiments on the challenging StarCraft II benchmark
demonstrate the effectiveness of MAG.

learning to decompose a data matrix into a product of parts that are often
interpretable. Many algorithms have been proposed during the last three
decades. A well-known method is the Multiplicative Updates algorithm proposed
by Lee and Seung in 2002. Multiplicative updates have many interesting
features: they are simple to implement and can be adapted to popular variants
such as sparse Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, and, according to recent
benchmarks, is state-of-the-art for many problems where the loss function is
not the Frobenius norm. In this manuscript, we propose to improve the
Multiplicative Updates algorithm seen as an alternating majorization
minimization algorithm by crafting a tighter upper bound of the Hessian matrix
for each alternate subproblem. Convergence is still ensured and we observe in
practice on both synthetic and real world dataset that the proposed fastMU
algorithm is often several orders of magnitude faster than the regular
Multiplicative Updates algorithm, and can even be competitive with
state-of-the-art methods for the Frobenius loss.

evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) methods for ovarian cancer diagnosis or

evaluated AI on histopathology images for diagnostic or prognostic inferences
in ovarian cancer, including tubo-ovarian and peritoneal tumours. Reviews and
non-English language articles were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed for
every included model using PROBAST. Results - A total of 1434 research articles
were identified, of which 36 were eligible for inclusion. These studies
reported 62 models of interest, including 35 classifiers, 14 survival
prediction models, 7 segmentation models, and 6 regression models. Models were
developed using 1-1375 slides from 1-664 ovarian cancer patients. A wide array
of outcomes were predicted, including overall survival (9/62), histological
subtypes (7/62), stain quantity (6/62) and malignancy (5/62). Older studies
used traditional machine learning (ML) models with hand-crafted features, while
newer studies typically employed deep learning (DL) to automatically learn
features and predict the outcome(s) of interest. All models were found to be at
high or unclear risk of bias overall. Research was frequently limited by
insufficient reporting, small sample sizes, and insufficient validation.
Conclusion - Limited research has been conducted and none of the associated
models have been demonstrated to be ready for real-world implementation.
Recommendations are provided addressing underlying biases and flaws in study
design, which should help inform higher-quality reproducible future research.
Key aspects include more transparent and comprehensive reporting, and improved

a number of other effects of dark matter on compact stars. Motivated by these

optimizes the performance of the GAN-based multilingual model in an effective

large-scale training data and various self-supervised signals (e.g., masked
random patches), vision transformers provide state-of-the-art performance on
several benchmarking datasets, such as ImageNet-1k and CIFAR-10. However, these
vision transformers pretrained over general large-scale image corpora could
only produce an anisotropic representation space, limiting their
generalizability and transferability to the target downstream tasks. In this
paper, we propose a simple and effective Label-aware Contrastive Training
framework LaCViT, which improves the isotropy of the pretrained representation
space for vision transformers, thereby enabling more effective transfer
learning amongst a wide range of image classification tasks. Through
experimentation over five standard image classification datasets, we
demonstrate that LaCViT-trained models outperform the original pretrained
baselines by around 9% absolute Accuracy@1, and consistent improvements can be
observed when applying LaCViT to our three evaluated vision transformers.

gives us unprecedented details on how the projectile deforms and interacts with
the granules, which information can be used to trace the development of
different remnant shapes. Furthermore, full dynamics of granular system is
revealed by the use of Particle Image Velocimetry. Kinetic energy, temperature

reproducing key features of simple and complex craters, we are able to detect a
possible artifact when compiling crater data from field studies. The depth of
craters from high-energy impacts in our work is found to be independent of

anatomical changes due to surgery. Guidance with live image feedback coming
directly from the surgical device, e.g., endoscope, can complement MRI-based
navigation or be an alternative if MRI guidance is not feasible. With this
motivation, we present a method for live image-only guidance leveraging a large

neurosurgical roadmaps using unsupervised embedding without assuming exact
anatomical matches between patients, presence of an extensive anatomical atlas,

encodes the common anatomical paths taken in surgeries in the training set. At
inference, the roadmap can be used to map a surgeon's current location using
live image feedback on the path to provide guidance by being able to predict
which structures should appear going forward or backward, much like a mapping
application. Even though the embedding is not supervised by position

This paper addresses an explicit pre-stabilization based control scheme which
handles the input constraints for the quadcopter in the flat output space with
a saturation component. The system's stability is shown to hold by
Lyapunov-stability arguments. Moreover, the practical viability of the proposed

epidemic diseases like hypertension or diabetes. And they become especially
useful when the arterioles and venules they depict are clearly identified and

demanding and taxing, which calls for automatic segmentation. Although
convolutional neural networks can achieve high overlap between predictions and
expert annotations, they often fail to produce topologically correct

bifurcation versus crossing ambiguity which causes classification mistakes.
This paper shows that including a topology preserving term in the loss function
improves the continuity of the segmented vessels, although at the expense of
artery-vein misclassification and overall lower overlap metrics. However, we
show that by including an orientation score guided convolutional module, based
on the anisotropic single sided cake wavelet, we reduce such misclassification
and further increase the topology correctness of the results. We evaluate our
model on public datasets with conveniently chosen metrics to assess both

determine the quasi-particle band structure of TBG with Hubbard interactions
for various magnetic orderings: modulated anti-ferromagnetic (MAFM), nodal
anti-ferromagnetic (NAFM) and hexagonal anti-ferromagnetic (HAFM). Then, we
develop an approach to incorporate these magnetic orderings along with the HF
potential in the continuum approximation. Away from the magic angle, we observe
a drastic effect of the magnetic order on the band structure of TBG compared to
the influence of the HF potential. Near the magic angle, however, the HF
potential seems to play a major role on the band structure compared to the
magnetic order. These findings suggest that the spin-valley degenerate broken
symmetry state often found in HF calculations of charge neutral TBG near the
magic angle should favour magnetic order, since the atomistic Hubbard
interaction will break this symmetry in favour of spin polarization.

achieve this by introducing new calibration parameters in the SEOBNRv5HM mode

this significantly improves the SEOBNRv5HM energy flux, when compared to
numerical-relativity (NR) simulations of binary black holes with mass ratios
between 1:1 and 1:20. Moreover, we find that, once the conservative part of the
SEOBNRv5 dynamics is calibrated, the SEOBNRv5HM waveform model with 2GSF
information reproduces the binding energy of NR simulations more accurately,
providing a powerful check of the consistency and naturalness of the EOB
approach. While we only include nonspinning 2GSF information, the more accurate
binding energy and energy flux carry over to the SEOBNRv5 waveform models for
spinning binary black holes. Thus, our results improve the latest generation of

droplets that coexist in a surrounding fluid. Recently, quantitative studies on
the material properties of biological condensates have become available,
revealing complex material properties. In vitro experiments have shown that
protein condensates exhibit time dependent material properties, similar to
aging in glasses. To understand this phenomenon from a theoretical perspective,
we develop a rheological model based on the physical picture of protein
diffusion and stochastic binding inside condensates. The complex nature of
protein interactions is captured by a distribution of binding energies,
incorporated in a trap model originally developed to study glass transitions.
Our model can describe diffusion of constituent particles, as well as the
material response to time-dependent forces, and it recapitulates the age
dependent relaxation time of Maxwell glass observed experimentally both in
active and passive rheology. We derive a generalized fluctuation-response

vortex row cotravelling with a water wave in a linear shear current. The main
theoretical tool is the Schwarz function of the wave and the work builds on a
novel framework recently set out by Crowdy [J. Fluid Mech., 954, A47, (2022)].
Conformal mapping theory is used to construct Schwarz functions with the
requisite properties and to parametrize the waveform. A two-parameter family of
solutions is found by solving a pair of nonlinear algebraic equations. This
system of equations has intriguing properties: indeed, it is degenerate, which
radically reduces the number of possible solutions, although the space of
physically admissible equilibria is still found to be rich and diverse. Inline
vortex streets, where the two vortex rows are aligned vertically, there is
generally a single physically admissible solution. However, for staggered
streets, where the two vortex rows are horizontally offset, certain parameter
regimes produce multiple solutions. An important outcome of the work is that
while only degenerate von K\'arm\'an point vortex streets can exist in an
unbounded simple shear current, a broad array of such equilibria are possible
in a shear current beneath a cotravelling wave on a free surface.

predecessor, SEOBNRv4HM, the waveform model i) incorporates recent high-order
post- Newtonian results in the inspiral, with improved resummations, ii)
includes the gravitational modes (l, |m|) = (3, 2), (4, 3), in addition to the

iii) is calibrated to larger mass-ratios and spins using a catalog of 442
numerical-relativity (NR) simulations and 13 additional waveforms from
black-hole perturbation theory, iv) incorporates information from second-order
gravitational self-force (2GSF) in the nonspinning modes and radiation-reaction

the dominant (2, 2) mode the maximum unfaithfulness in the total mass range
$10-300 M_{\odot}$ is below $10^{-3}$ for 90% of the cases (38% for
SEOBNRv4HM). When including all modes up to l = 5 we find 98% (49%) of the
cases with unfaithfulness below $10^{-2} (10^{-3})$, while these numbers reduce
to 88% (5%) when using SEOBNRv4HM. Furthermore, the model shows improved
agreement with NR in other dynamical quantities (e.g., the angular momentum
flux and binding energy), providing a powerful check of its physical
robustness. We implemented the waveform model in a high-performance Python
package (pySEOBNR), which leads to evaluation times faster than SEOBNRv4HM by a
factor 10 to 50, depending on the configuration, and provides the flexibility
to easily include spin-precession and eccentric effects, thus making it the

  Milky Way outer disc","Submitted to A&A. Abridged",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Context: With the data releases from the astrometric space mission Gaia, the
exploration of the structure of the Milky Way has developed in unprecedented
detail and unveiled many previously unknown structures in the Galactic disc and
halo. One such feature is the phase spiral where the stars in the Galactic disc
form a spiral density pattern in the $Z-V_Z$ plane. Aims: We aim to
characterize the shape, rotation, amplitude, and metallicity of the phase
spiral in the outer disc of the Milky Way. This will allow us to better
understand which physical processes caused the phase spiral and can give
further clues to the Milky Way's past and the events that contributed to its
current state. Methods: We use Gaia data release 3 (DR3) to get full position
and velocity data on approximately 31.5 million stars, and metallicity for a
subset of them. We then compute the angular momenta of the stars and develop a
model to characterise the phase spiral in terms of amplitude and rotation at
different locations in the disc. Results: We find that the rotation angle of
the phase spiral changes with Galactic azimuth and Galactocentric radius,
making the phase spiral appear to rotate about $3^\circ$ per degree in Galactic
azimuth. Furthermore, we find that the phase spiral in the $2200 - 2400$ kpc km
s$^{-1}$ range of angular momentum is particularly strong compared to the phase
spiral that can be observed in the solar neighbourhood. The metallicity of the
phase spiral appears to match that of the Milky Way disc field stars.
Conclusions: We created a new model capable of fitting several key parameters
of the phase spiral. We have been able to determine the rotation rate of the
phase spiral and found a peak in the phase spiral amplitude which manifests as
a very clear phase spiral when using only stars with similar angular momentum.

That is, clip-level pseudo labels generated from each network are used to
supervise the other one at the next training round, and the two networks are
learned alternatively and iteratively. Our proposed method is able to better
deal with the anomalies with varying durations as well as subtle anomalies.
Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method

origin of the compact binaries detected by ground- and space-based
gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, and shed light on their possible formation
channels. Efficiently and accurately modeling the GW signals emitted by these

multipolar precessing-spin waveform model within the effective-one-body (EOB)

SEOBNRv5HM, which is calibrated to $442$ numerical-relativity (NR) simulations,
13 waveforms from BH perturbation theory, and non-spinning energy flux from
second-order gravitational self-force theory. We remark that SEOBNRv5PHM is not
calibrated to precessing-spin NR waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme
Spacetimes Collaboration. We validate SEOBNRv5PHM by computing the
unfaithfulness against 1543 precessing-spin NR waveforms, and find that for
99.8% (84.4%) of the cases, the maximum value, in the total mass range 20-300
$M_\odot$, is below 3% (1%). These numbers reduce to 95.3% (60.8%) when using

phenomenological IMRPhenomXPHM model. Due to much better computational
efficiency of SEOBNRv5PHM compared to SEOBNRv4PHM, we are also able to perform
extensive Bayesian parameter estimation on synthetic signals and GW events
observed by LIGO-Virgo detectors. We show that SEOBNRv5PHM can be used as a
standard tool for inference analyses to extract astrophysical and cosmological

methods whose outputs could achieve (expected) excess population risks that are

comparison field sample drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We compare the
star-formation rate (SFR) versus stellar mass relation as a function of
environment and morphology. After carefully controlling for mass, we find that
in all environments, the degree of SFR suppression increases with increasing
bulge-to-total (B/T) ratio. In addition, the SFRs of cluster and infall
galaxies at a fixed mass are more suppressed than their field counterparts at
all values of B/T. These results suggest a quenching mechanism that is linked
to bulge growth that operates in all environments and an additional mechanism
that further reduces the SFRs of galaxies in dense environments. We limit the
sample to $B/T < 0.3$ galaxies to control for the trends with morphology and
find that the excess population of cluster galaxies with suppressed SFRs
persists. We model the timescale associated with the decline of SFRs in dense
environments and find that the observed SFRs of the cluster core galaxies are
consistent with a range of models including: a mechanism that acts slowly and
continuously over a long (2-5 Gyr) timescale, and a more rapid ($<1$ Gyr)
quenching event that occurs after a delay period of 1-6 Gyr. Quenching may
therefore start immediately after galaxies enter clusters.

commits and the semantic similarity of review comments. We conducted a series

comparing these similarity detection methods in separate and combined ways with
the baseline reviewer recommendation approach, RevFinder. The results show that
the common similarity detection methods can produce acceptable performance

used in recommending code reviewers can impact the performance of reviewer
recommendation approaches. We also discuss the potential implications of our

geared towards either practical efficiency or compression ratios, as required.
For a text of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\sigma$ and a fixed

to the length of the character's code-word, plus an expected
$\mathcal{O}((F_{\sigma - \lambda + 3} - 3)/F_{\sigma+1})$ overhead, where
$F_j$ is the $j$-th number of the Fibonacci sequence. In the overall it uses

Experimental results show that the performance of our scheme is, in some
respects, comparable with the performance of DACs and Wavelet Tees, which are
among of the most efficient schemes. In addition our scheme is configured as a

interpret the spontaneous emergence of long range correlations in nature. Since
then many different models had been introduced to study SOC. All of them have
few common features: externally driven dynamical systems self-organize
themselves to non-equilibrium stationary states exhibiting fluctuations of all
length scales as the signatures of criticality. In contrast, we have studied
here in the framework of the sandpile model a system that has mass inflow but
no outflow. There is no boundary, and particles cannot escape from the system
by any means. Therefore, there is no current balance, and consequently it is
not expected that the system would arrive at a stationary state. In spite of
that, it is observed that the bulk of the system self-organizes to a
quasi-steady state where the grain density is maintained at a nearly constant
value. Power law distributed fluctuations of all length and time scales have
been observed which are the signatures of criticality. Our detailed computer
simulation study gives the set of critical exponents whose values are very
close to their counter parts in the original sandpile model. This study
indicates that (i) a physical boundary and (ii) the stationary state though
sufficient but may not be the necessary criteria for achieving SOC.

performed so as to reduce the action, and as the coarse-graining progresses,
the field strength becomes very small. However, configurations flowed from
configurations in the confinement phase keep their confinement property that
the particles are strongly interacting. It is seemingly mysterious, and
something stable against coarse-graining is expected to be behind the nature of
confinement. By performing Monte Carlo simulations of U(1) lattice gauge
theory, we discusses the relationship between the gradient flow and magnetic
monopoles created by the compactness of the U(1) gauge group. Many magnetic
monopoles are generated in the confinement phase but not so many in the
deconfinement phase. Since the monopole is a kind of topological quantity, the
number of monopoles does not change much by the coarse-graining. To investigate
why the confinement properties are not lost by the gradient flow, we computed
Wilson loops and Polyakov loops separating them into the field strength and the
monopole contributions. We found that the field strength, which decreases with
the gradient flow, does not affect confinement properties, and the monopole and
the confinement properties are strongly related. Furthermore, we discuss the
relationship between the magnetic monopole and the center symmetry, which is
the symmetry broken by the confinement phase transition.

to accelerate training of neural networks. However, due to the prohibitive

scalable to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Many such approximations have been
attempted. The most sophisticated of these is KFAC, which approximates the FIM
as a block-diagonal matrix, where each block corresponds to a layer of the
neural network. By doing so, KFAC ignores the interactions between different
layers. In this work, we investigate the interest of restoring some
low-frequency interactions between the layers by means of two-level methods.
Inspired from domain decomposition, several two-level corrections to KFAC using
different coarse spaces are proposed and assessed. The obtained results show
that incorporating the layer interactions in this fashion does not really
improve the performance of KFAC. This suggests that it is safe to discard the
off-diagonal blocks of the FIM, since the block-diagonal approach is
sufficiently robust, accurate and economical in computation time.

However, existing methods rely on good superpoint correspondences, which are
hard to be obtained reliably and efficiently, thus resulting in less robust and
accurate point cloud registration. In this paper, we propose a novel network,
named RDMNet, to find dense point correspondences coarse-to-fine and improve
final pose estimation based on such reliable correspondences. Our RDMNet uses a
devised 3D-RoFormer mechanism to first extract distinctive superpoints and
generates reliable superpoints matches between two point clouds. The proposed
3D-RoFormer fuses 3D position information into the transformer network,
efficiently exploiting point clouds' contextual and geometric information to
generate robust superpoint correspondences. RDMNet then propagates the sparse
superpoints matches to dense point matches using the neighborhood information
for accurate point cloud registration. We extensively evaluate our method on
multiple datasets from different environments. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in
all tested datasets with a strong generalization ability.

situations where different properties of a particle appear to be localised in
different paths of an interferometer and therefore spatially separated. This
observation is obtained by implementing a pre- and postselection procedure. The
localisations are determined qualitatively through conspicuous changes induced
by weak interactions. Previous demonstrations of the qCC only used the path and
spin/polarisation degrees of freedom. In addition, the present experiment uses
the neutron's energy as a third property in a three-path interferometer. It is
demonstrated that the three properties of neutrons are found separated in
different paths in the interferometer; a detailed analysis suggests that the
appearance of a property is strongly related to the geometrical relation
between the state vectors of pre- and postselection with weak interactions in
between. If a weak interaction in a path locally generates a state vector with
a component parallel to the reference state in another path, a conspicuous
intensity oscillation is expected and observed. Therefore, the appearance of
the observed intensity oscillations is attributed solely to the cross-terms
between the reference and the newly generated state via weak interactions.

resulting in an infeasible computational burden. Thus, we leveraged the
Integrated Nested Laplace Approximations (INLA) algorithm, a fast approximation
method, to ensure the feasibility of these simulations. Methods: We simulated
Bayesian adaptive two-arm superiority trials that stratified participants into
two disease severity states. The outcome was analyzed with proportional odds
logistic regression. Trials were stopped for superiority or futility,
separately for each state. We calculated the type I error and power across 64
scenarios that varied the stopping thresholds and the minimum sample size
before commencing adaptive analyses. We incorporated dynamic borrowing and used
INLA to compute the posterior distributions at each adaptive analysis. Designs
that maintained a type I error below 5%, a power above 80%, and a feasible mean
sample size were then evaluated across 22 scenarios that varied the odds ratios
for the two severity states. Results: Power generally increased as the initial
sample size and the threshold for declaring futility increased. Two designs
were selected for further analysis. In the comprehensive simulations, the one
design had a higher chance of reaching a trial conclusion before the maximum
sample size and higher probability of declaring superiority when appropriate
without a substantial increase in sample size for the more realistic scenarios
and was selected as the trial design. Conclusions: We designed a Bayesian
adaptive trial to evaluate novel strategies for ventilation using the INLA
algorithm to and optimize the trial design through simulation.

deflection and correction of image aberrations up to the 3rd order. Owing to a
deflection angle of only 4{\deg}, the total beam displacement in the filter is
just ~10 mm. Hence, the entire instrument is compact and just requires a
straight vacuum tube. The multipole is framed by transfer lenses in the

different sizes on piezomotor-driven holders allow selecting the desired
resolution. The combination of apertures and dodecapole acts as a bandpass

potential well, as one of the Milky Way formation mechanisms, is reexamined to
understand how the stars of the merging clusters are redistributed during and
after the merger process using, for the first time, simulations with a high
resolution concentrated in the 300 pc around the Galactic center. We adopted
simulations developed in the framework of the ""Modelling the Evolution of
Galactic Nuclei"" (MEGaN) project. We compared the evolution of representative
clusters in the mass and concentration basis in the vicinity of a supermassive
black hole. We used the spatial distribution, density profile, and the $50\%$
Lagrange radius (half mass radius) as indicators along the complete simulation
to study the evolutionary shape in physical and velocity space and the final
fate of these representative clusters. We detect that the least massive
clusters are quickly (<10 Myr) destroyed. Instead, the most massive clusters
have a long evolution, showing variations in the morphology, especially after
each passage close to the supermassive black hole. The deformation of the
clusters depends on the concentration, with general deformations for the least
concentrated clusters and outer strains for the more concentrated ones. At the
end of the simulation, a dense concentration of stars belonging to the clusters
is formed. The particles that belong to the most massive and most concentrated
clusters are concentrated in the innermost regions, meaning that the most
massive and concentrated clusters contribute with a more significant fraction
of particles to the final concentration, which suggests that the population of
stars of the nuclear star cluster formed through this mechanism comes from
massive clusters rather than low-mass globular clusters.

  for N-ary Symmetric Markov Sources","This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) is a recently proposed metric for
real-time remote monitoring systems. In particular, AoII measures the time the
information at the monitor is incorrect, weighted by the magnitude of this
incorrectness, thereby combining the notions of freshness and distortion. This
paper addresses the definition of an AoII-optimal transmission policy in a
discrete-time communication scheme with a resource constraint and a hybrid
automatic repeat request (HARQ) protocol. Considering an $N$-ary symmetric
Markov source, the problem is formulated as an infinite-horizon average-cost
constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). The source model is characterized
by the cardinality of the state space and the probability of staying at the
same state. Interestingly, it is proved that under some conditions, the optimal
transmission policy is to never transmit. This reveals that there exists a
region of the source dynamics where communication is inadequate in reducing the
AoII. Elsewhere, there exists an optimal transmission policy, which is a
randomized mixture of two discrete threshold-based policies that randomize at
one state. The optimal threshold and the randomization component are derived
analytically. Numerical results illustrate the impact of source dynamics,
channel conditions, and the resource constraint on the average AoII.

$0.01-1.04$. We build mock spectroscopic redshift catalogues of simulated
galaxies within these clusters and apply the caustic technique to estimate the

profile from the 3D simulation data and calculate the ratio of caustic mass to
total 3D mass, $\mathcal{F}_\beta$, as a function of cluster-centric distance
and identify the radial range where $\mathcal{F}_\beta$ is roughly constant.
The filling factor, $\mathcal{F}_\beta=0.41\pm 0.08$, is constant on a plateau
that covers a wide cluster-centric distance range, $(0.6-4.2)R_{200c}$. This
calibration is insensitive to redshift. The calibrated caustic mass profiles
are unbiased, with an average uncertainty of $23\%$. At $R_{200c}$, the average
$M^C/M^{3D}=1.03\pm 0.22$; at $2R_{200c}$, the average $M^C/M^{3D}=1.02\pm

Autoencoder (BIB-AE) architecture, designed for the simulation of particle

generalise the model to a multi-parameter conditioning scenario, while
retaining a high degree of physics fidelity. In a second step, we perform a
detailed study of the effect of applying a state-of-the-art particle flow-based

microscopically in the Wigner-Seitz cell approximation, simulating the
conditions of the inner crust of a cold, non-accreting neutron star, in which a
lattice of nuclei coexists with a sea of superfluid neutrons. The calculation
is based on the axially deformed Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov framework, using
effective interactions. The present work extends and improves previous studies
in four ways: i) it allows for the axial deformation of protons induced by the
large deformation of neutrons due to the appearance of vortices; ii) it
includes the effect of Coulomb exchange; iii) considers the possible effects of
the screening of the pairing interaction; and iv) it improves the numerical
treatment. We also demonstrate that the binding energy of the nucleus-vortex
system can be used as a proxy to the pinning energy of a vortex and discuss in
which conditions this applies. From our results, we can estimate the mesoscopic
pinning forces per unit length acting on vortices. We obtain values ranging
between $10^{14}$ to $10^{16}$ dyn/cm, consistent with previous findings.

prototypes. Generic TCAD Device and Monte-Carlo simulations are used to
establish an understanding of the technology and provide important insight into
performance parameters of the sensor. Testing prototypes in laboratory and test

The proposed method utilizes a single state-input trajectory generated from the

invariance-inducing feedback controller, without the need to identify a model
of the system. The problem is formulated in terms of a set of sufficient LMI
conditions that are then combined in a semi-definite program to maximize the
volume of the RCI set while respecting the state and input constraints. We
demonstrate through a numerical case study that the proposed data-driven
approach can generate RCI sets that are of comparable size to those obtained by
a model-based method in which exact knowledge of the system matrices is
assumed. Under the assumption of persistency of excitation of the data, the
proposed algorithm guarantees robust invariance even with a small number of

offers a reliable and efficient counterpart to the model-based methods for RCI

optimal sample complexity is linear in dimensionality, and interestingly, the
commonly used sample kurtosis-based approaches are necessarily suboptimal.
However, the optimal sample complexity becomes quadratic, up to a logarithmic
factor, in the dimension if we restrict ourselves to estimates that can be

computationally tractable estimates that attain both the optimal sample

modeled with indicator variables for identifying the support of the continuous

problems through perspective reformulation techniques. In contrast to the
majority of previous work that relies on support function arguments and
disjunctive programming techniques to provide convex hull results, we propose a
constructive approach that exploits a hidden conic structure induced by
perspective functions. To this end, we first establish a convex hull result for
a general conic mixed-binary set in which each conic constraint involves a
linear function of independent continuous variables and a set of binary
variables. We then demonstrate that extended representations of sets associated
with epigraphs of rank-one convex functions over constraints modeling indicator
relations naturally admit such a conic representation. This enables us to
systematically give perspective formulations for the convex hull descriptions
of these sets with nonlinear separable or non-separable objective functions,
sign constraints on continuous variables, and combinatorial constraints on
indicator variables. We illustrate the efficacy of our results on sparse

are difficulties with description of relaxation processes without explicit
considering of environment degrees of freedom. To correctly evaluate the
relaxation rates, it is necessary to consider the interaction of the system
with its environment taking into account the counter-rotating wave and
diamagnetic terms. We develop a self-consistent theory for calculation of the
relaxation rates in the systems, in which the coupling strength is of the order
of the system eigenfrequency. We demonstrate that the increase in the coupling
strength can lead to a significant decrease in the relaxation rates. In
particular, we show that for frequency-independent density of states of the

the coupling strength. This fact can be used to suppress losses by tuning the

contain the reading articles for students from Grade 1 to Grade 12. This
dataset has 699 reading passages which are prose and poems, and 5,273
questions. The questions in the new dataset are not fixed with four options as
in the previous version. Moreover, the difficulty of questions is increased,
which challenges the models to find the correct choice. The computer must
understand the whole context of the reading passage, the question, and the

fast and accurate solution is challenging since the measured data is normally
contaminated with noise and the traditional method to solve IHTP involves
significant amount of calculations. Therefore, in this work, a rapid yet robust
inversion algorithm called ANN-based extended Kalman smoothing algorithm is
developed to realize the online prediction of desired parameter based on the

CFD-based state transfer models in extended Kalman smoothing algorithm with
pre-trained ANN. Then, a two-dimensional internal convective heat transfer
problem was employed as the case study to test the algorithm. The results have
proved that the proposed algorithm is a computational-light and robust approach

systematic and extensive studies of recent 2D FSL and 3D backbone networks for
benchmarking few-shot point cloud classification, and we suggest a strong
baseline and learning architectures for 3D FSL. Then, we propose a novel
plug-and-play component called Cross-Instance Adaptation (CIA) module, to
address the high intra-class variances and subtle inter-class differences
issues, which can be easily inserted into current baselines with significant
performance improvement. Extensive experiments on two newly introduced

where only some agents are reincarnated, whereas the others are trained from

heterogeneous agents, we demonstrate that selective reincarnation can lead to
higher returns than training fully from scratch, and faster convergence than
training with full reincarnation. However, the choice of which agents to
reincarnate in a heterogeneous system is vitally important to the outcome of
the training -- in fact, a poor choice can lead to considerably worse results

temporal gradient magnitude of the embeddings (i.e. the distance between the
embeddings of subsequent frames) is typically minimal far from the boundaries
and higher nearer the boundaries. We use a thresholding function on the
temporal gradient magnitude to define a psuedo-label for wordness. We train a
linear classifier, mapping the embedding of a single frame to the pseudo-label.
Finally, we use the classifier score to predict whether a frame is a word or a

adaptive structural evolution and multi-scale biological learning rules. For
structural evolution, an adaptive evolvable LSM model is developed to optimize
the neural architecture design of liquid layer with separation property. For
brain-inspired learning of LSM, we propose a dopamine-modulated

LSM and flexibly adapt to rule reversal. This work is committed to exploring
how evolution can help to design more appropriate network architectures and how
multi-scale neuroplasticity principles coordinated to enable the optimization

is built from tiny invisible constituents, called tetrons, with bond length
about the Planck length and binding energy the Planck energy. Details of the
approach provide a powerful unified picture for particle physics and cosmology.
All physical properties in the universe can be derived from properties of the
tetrons. This philosophy is applied here to the Standard Model mass and mixing
parameters which are shown to be determined by the interactions among tetrons.
The most general ansatz for these interactions leads to a Hamiltonian involving
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), Heisenberg and torsional isospin forces. While the
masses of the third and second family arise from DM and Heisenberg type of
isospin interactions, light family masses are related to torsional interactions
among tetrons. Neutrino masses turn out to be special in that they are given in
terms of tiny isospin non-conserving DM, Heisenberg and torsional couplings.
Moving on to the CKM and PMNS mixing, some preliminary results are reported.
They allow to trace the observed hierarchy in the CKM matrix to the dominance
of the top mass and to attribute the large non-diagonal PMNS matrix elements to
the approximate conservation of isospin. One important finding is the influence
that lepton masses have on the CKM parameters.

Specifically, the platform uses reinforcement learning to understand the

Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) can be drastically
affected by low light and adverse weather conditions. Collisions with large
animals such as deer in low light cause significant cost and damage every year.
In this paper, we propose the first AI-based method for future trajectory
prediction of large animals and mitigating the risk of collision with them in
low light. In order to minimize false collision warnings, in our multi-step
framework, first, the large animal is accurately detected and a preliminary
risk level is predicted for it and low-risk animals are discarded. In the next
stage, a multi-stream CONV-LSTM-based encoder-decoder framework is designed to
predict the future trajectory of the potentially high-risk animals. The
proposed model uses camera motion prediction as well as the local and global
context of the scene to generate accurate predictions. Furthermore, this paper
introduces a new dataset of FIR videos for large animal detection and risk
estimation in real nighttime driving scenarios. Our experiments show promising
results of the proposed framework in adverse conditions. Our code is available
online.

in DG NT GAAFET due to enhanced electrostatic control, which are certificated
by improved Ioff, SS, and Ion/Ioff ratio obtained. On the other hand, the Ion
of NT GAAFET is comparable with that of NW GAA-FET. Whereas, its Ioff is 1
order smaller, and SS is almost 2 times smaller compared with those of NW

  Distribution","17 pages",,,,"cs.CV cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Despite the recent remarkable improvements in scene text recognition (STR),
the majority of the studies focused mainly on the English language, which only
includes few number of characters. However, STR models show a large performance
degradation on languages with a numerous number of characters (e.g., Chinese
and Korean), especially on characters that rarely appear due to the long-tailed
distribution of characters in such languages. To address such an issue, we
conducted an empirical analysis using synthetic datasets with different
character-level distributions (e.g., balanced and long-tailed distributions).
While increasing a substantial number of tail classes without considering the
context helps the model to correctly recognize characters individually,
training with such a synthetic dataset interferes the model with learning the
contextual information (i.e., relation among characters), which is also
important for predicting the whole word. Based on this motivation, we propose a
novel Context-Aware and Free Experts Network (CAFE-Net) using two experts: 1)
context-aware expert learns the contextual representation trained with a
long-tailed dataset composed of common words used in everyday life and 2)
context-free expert focuses on correctly predicting individual characters by
utilizing a dataset with a balanced number of characters. By training two
experts to focus on learning contextual and visual representations,
respectively, we propose a novel confidence ensemble method to compensate the
limitation of each expert. Through the experiments, we demonstrate that
CAFE-Net improves the STR performance on languages containing numerous number
of characters. Moreover, we show that CAFE-Net is easily applicable to various
STR models.

applications, for example by constructing deep belief networks. Statistical
inference on a Boltzmann machine can be carried out by sampling from its
posterior distribution. However, uniform sampling from such a model is not
trivial due to an extremely multi-modal distribution. Quantum computers have
the promise of solving some non-trivial problems in an efficient manner. We
explored the application of a D-Wave quantum annealer to generate samples from
a restricted Boltzmann machine. The samples are further improved by Markov
chains in a hybrid quantum-classical setup. We demonstrated that quantum
annealer samples can improve the performance of Gibbs sampling compared to
random initialization. The hybrid setup is considerably more efficient than a
pure classical sampling. We also investigated the impact of annealing
parameters (temperature) to improve the quality of samples. By increasing the
amount of classical processing (Gibbs updates) the benefit of quantum annealing
vanishes, which may be justified by the limited performance of today's quantum
computers compared to classical.

inference with Deep Neural Networks (DNN). However, due to the inherent limits
to the parallelism they can exploit, DNNs often under-utilize the capacity of
today's high-end accelerators. Although spatial multiplexing of the GPU, leads
to higher GPU utilization and higher inference throughput, there remain a
number of challenges. Finding the GPU percentage for right-sizing the GPU for
each DNN through profiling, determining an optimal batching of requests to
balance throughput improvement while meeting application-specific deadlines and
service level objectives (SLOs), and maximizing throughput by appropriately
scheduling DNNs are still significant challenges. This paper introduces a
dynamic and fair spatio-temporal scheduler (D-STACK) that enables multiple DNNs
to run in the GPU concurrently. To help allocate the appropriate GPU percentage
(we call it the ""Knee""), we develop and validate a model that estimates the
parallelism each DNN can utilize. We also develop a lightweight optimization
formulation to find an efficient batch size for each DNN operating with
D-STACK. We bring together our optimizations and our spatio-temporal scheduler
to provide a holistic inference framework. We demonstrate its ability to
provide high throughput while meeting application SLOs. We compare D-STACK with
an ideal scheduler that can allocate the right GPU percentage for every DNN
kernel. D-STACK gets higher than 90 percent throughput and GPU utilization
compared to the ideal scheduler. We also compare D-STACK with other GPU
multiplexing and scheduling methods (e.g., NVIDIA Triton, Clipper, Nexus),
using popular DNN models. Our controlled experiments with multiplexing several
popular DNN models achieve up to 1.6X improvement in GPU utilization and up to
4X improvement in inference throughput.

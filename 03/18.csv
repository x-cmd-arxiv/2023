with multiple sensors and effectors. Recent simulation methods enable the
Digital Twin (DT) concept realisation. However, DT employment in robotic system
development, e.g. in-development testing, is unclear. During the system
development, its parts evolve from simulated mockups to physical parts which
run software deployed on the actual hardware. Therefore, a design tool and a
flexible development procedure ensuring the integrity of the simulated and
physical parts are required.
  We aim to maximise the integration between a CPS's simulated and physical
parts in various setups. The better integration, the better simulation-based
testing coverage of the physical part (hardware and software).
  We propose a Domain Specification Language (DSL) based on Systems Modeling
Language (SysML) that we refer to as SPSysML (Simulation-Physical System
Modeling Language). SPSysML defines the taxonomy of a Simulation-Physical
System (SPSys), being a CPS consisting of at least a physical or simulated
part. In particular, the simulated ones can be DTs. We propose a SPSys
Development Procedure (SPSysDP) that enables the maximisation of the
simulation-physical integrity of SPSys by evaluating the proposed factors.
  SPSysDP is used to develop a complex robotic system for the INCARE project.
In subsequent iterations of SPSysDP, the simulation-physical integrity of the
system is maximised. As a result, the system model consists of fewer
components, and a greater fraction of the system components are shared between
various system setups. We implement and test the system with popular
frameworks, Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo simulator.
  SPSysML with SPSysDP enables the design of SPSys (including DT and CPS),
multi-setup system development featuring maximised integrity between simulation
and physical parts in its setups.

ansatz in combination with variational Monte Carlo methods for solving the
electronic Schr\""odinger equation. However, despite their success and favorable
scaling, these methods are still computationally too costly for wide adoption.
A significant obstacle is the requirement to optimize the wavefunction from
scratch for each new system, thus requiring long optimization. In this work, we
propose a novel neural network ansatz, which effectively maps uncorrelated,
computationally cheap Hartree-Fock orbitals, to correlated, high-accuracy
neural network orbitals. This ansatz is inherently capable of learning a single
wavefunction across multiple compounds and geometries, as we demonstrate by
successfully transferring a wavefunction model pre-trained on smaller fragments
to larger compounds. Furthermore, we provide ample experimental evidence to
support the idea that extensive pre-training of a such a generalized
wavefunction model across different compounds and geometries could lead to a
foundation wavefunction model. Such a model could yield high-accuracy ab-initio
energies using only minimal computational effort for fine-tuning and evaluation
of observables.

widely used to enhance the robustness of the training models on deep neural
networks. Although considerable efforts of adversarial attacks on improving the
transferability of adversarial examples have been developed, the attack success
rate of the transfer-based attacks on the surrogate model is much higher than
that on victim model under the low attack strength (e.g., the attack strength
$\epsilon=8/255$). In this paper, we first systematically investigated this
issue and found that the enormous difference of attack success rates between
the surrogate model and victim model is caused by the existence of a special
area (known as fuzzy domain in our paper), in which the adversarial examples in
the area are classified wrongly by the surrogate model while correctly by the
victim model. Then, to eliminate such enormous difference of attack success
rates for improving the transferability of generated adversarial examples, a
fuzziness-tuned method consisting of confidence scaling mechanism and
temperature scaling mechanism is proposed to ensure the generated adversarial
examples can effectively skip out of the fuzzy domain. The confidence scaling
mechanism and the temperature scaling mechanism can collaboratively tune the
fuzziness of the generated adversarial examples through adjusting the gradient
descent weight of fuzziness and stabilizing the update direction, respectively.
Specifically, the proposed fuzziness-tuned method can be effectively integrated
with existing adversarial attacks to further improve the transferability of
adverarial examples without changing the time complexity. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that fuzziness-tuned method can effectively enhance the
transferability of adversarial examples in the latest transfer-based attacks.

  Responses and Response Time? An Illustration with the PISA 2015 Data",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It is widely believed that a joint factor analysis of item responses and
response time (RT) may yield more precise ability scores that are
conventionally predicted from responses only. For this purpose, a
simple-structure factor model is often preferred as it only requires specifying
an additional measurement model for item-level RT while leaving the original
item response theory (IRT) model for responses intact. The added speed factor
indicated by item-level RT correlates with the ability factor in the IRT model,
allowing RT data to carry additional information about respondents' ability.
However, parametric simple-structure factor models are often restrictive and
fit poorly to empirical data, which prompts under-confidence in the suitablity
of a simple factor structure. In the present paper, we analyze the 2015
Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) mathematics data using a
semiparametric simple-structure model. We conclude that a simple factor
structure attains a decent fit after further parametric assumptions in the
measurement model are sufficiently relaxed. Furthermore, our semiparametric
model implies that the association between latent ability and speed/slowness is
strong in the population, but the form of association is nonlinear. It follows
that scoring based on the fitted model can substantially improve the precision
of ability scores.

compressed kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ under pressure is studied by the
Migdal-Eliashberg formalism and density-functional theory calculations. We find
that the superconducting gap distribution driven by electron-phonon coupling is
nodeless and anisotropic. It is revealed that the hybridized V 3$d$ and Sb 5$p$
orbitals are strongly coupled to the V-V bond-stretching and V-Sb bond-bending
phonon modes, giving rise to a wide spread of superconducting gap depending on
its associated Fermi-surface sheets and momentum. Specifically, the
superconducting gaps associated with V 3$d_{xy,x^2-y^2,z^2}$ and 3$d_{xz,yz}$
orbitals are larger in their average magnitude and more widely spread compared
to that associated with the Sb 5$p_z$ orbital. Our findings demonstrate that
the superconductivity of compressed CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ can be explained by the
anisotropic multiband pairing mechanism with conventional phonon-mediated
$s$-wave symmetry, evidenced by recent experimental observations under pressure

functions (CBF) for control-affine polynomial systems with bounded additive
uncertainty and convex polynomial constraints on the control. We first
formulate robust CBF verification and synthesis as multilevel polynomial
optimization problems (POP), where verification optimizes -- in three levels --
the uncertainty, control, and state, while synthesis additionally optimizes the
parameter of a chosen parametric CBF candidate. We then show that, by invoking
the KKT conditions of the inner optimizations over uncertainty and control, the
verification problem can be simplified as a single-level POP and the synthesis
problem reduces to a min-max POP. This reduction leads to multilevel
semidefinite relaxations. For the verification problem, we apply Lasserre's
hierarchy of moment relaxations. For the synthesis problem, we draw connections
to existing relaxation techniques for robust min-max POP, which first use
sum-of-squares programming to find increasingly tight polynomial lower bounds
to the unknown value function of the verification POP, and then call Lasserre's
hierarchy again to maximize the lower bounds. Both semidefinite relaxations
guarantee asymptotic global convergence to optimality. We provide an in-depth
study of our framework on the controlled Van der Pol Oscillator, both with and

critical window, components merge approximately like the multiplicative
coalescent, (ii) asymptotics of the susceptibility functions are the same as
that of the Erdos-Renyi random graph, (iii) asymptotic negligibility of the
maximal component size and the diameter in the barely subcritical regime, and
(iv) macroscopic averaging of distances between vertices in the barely

  As an application of the general universality theorem, we establish, under
some regularity conditions, the critical percolation scaling limit of graphs
that converge, in a suitable topology, to an $L^3$ graphon. In particular, we
define a notion of the critical window in this setting. The $L^3$ assumption
ensures that the model is in the Erdos-Renyi universality class and that the
scaling limit is Brownian. Our results do not assume any specific functional
form for the graphon. As a consequence of our results on graphons, we obtain
the metric scaling limit for Aldous-Pittel's RGIV model [9] inside the critical
window.
  Our universality principle has applications in a number of other problems
including in the study of noise sensitivity of critical random graphs [52]. In
[10], we use our universality theorem to establish the metric scaling limit of
critical bounded size rules. Our method should yield the critical metric

have emerged as a promising approach for image-based surface reconstruction.
However, existing optimization methods assume solid surfaces and are therefore

which also exhibit low opacity due to the blending effect with the background.
While neural radiance field (NeRF) based methods can model semi-transparency
and achieve photo-realistic quality in synthesized novel views, their
volumetric geometry representation tightly couples geometry and opacity, and
therefore cannot be easily converted into surfaces without introducing
artifacts. We present $\alpha$Surf, a novel surface representation with
decoupled geometry and opacity for the reconstruction of semi-transparent and
thin surfaces where the colors mix. Ray-surface intersections on our
representation can be found in closed-form via analytical solutions of cubic
polynomials, avoiding Monte-Carlo sampling and is fully differentiable by
construction. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our

an exponentially tilted empirical likelihood carefully designed to concentrate
near a parametric family of distributions of choice with respect to a novel
variant of the Wasserstein metric, which is then combined with a prior
distribution on model parameters to obtain a robustified posterior. The
proposed approach finds applications in a wide variety of robust inference
problems, where we intend to perform inference on the parameters associated
with the centering distribution in presence of outliers. Our proposed transport
metric enjoys great computational simplicity, exploiting the Sinkhorn
regularization for discrete optimal transport problems, and being inherently
parallelizable. We demonstrate superior performance of our methodology when

demonstrate equivalence of our approach with a nonparametric Bayesian

same circularity and opposite polarity. Each vortex is stabilized by opposite
sign Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. This stabilization mechanism
potentially opens the door towards BP-based spintronic applications. An open
question, from a methodological point of view, is whether the Heisenberg (HB)
model approach (atomistic model) as to be used to study such systems or if the

important role than the chosen model. Further, we study the dynamics by
shifting the BP with an applied in-plane field and investigating the relaxation
after switching the filed off abruptly. The precessional motion of coupled
vortices in a BP state can be drastically reduced compared to a classical

the users' implicit feedback. Previous work such as Hofmann et al (2011) has
evaluated the most promising interleaved methods at the time, on uniform
distributions of queries. In the real world, ordinarily, there is an unbalanced
distribution of repeated queries that follows a long-tailed users' search
demand curve. The more a query is executed, by different users (or in different
sessions), the higher the probability of collecting implicit feedback
(interactions/clicks) on the related search results. This paper first aims to
replicate the Team Draft Interleaving accuracy evaluation on uniform query
distributions and then focuses on assessing how this method generalizes to
long-tailed real-world scenarios. The reproducibility work raised interesting
considerations on how the winning ranking function for each query should impact
the overall winner for the entire evaluation. Based on what was observed, we
propose that not all the queries should contribute to the final decision in
equal proportion. As a result of these insights, we designed two variations of
the $\Delta_{AB}$ score winner estimator that assign to each query a credit
based on statistical hypothesis testing. To replicate, reproduce and extend the
original work, we have developed from scratch a system that simulates a search
engine and users' interactions from datasets from the industry. Our experiments
confirm our intuition and show that our methods are promising in terms of
accuracy, sensitivity, and robustness to noise.

cosmological models to fit the magnitude-redshift relation of the Pantheon
Sample consisting of 1048 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the range of $0.01 < z
< 2.26$. Apart from the well-known flat $\Lambda$CDM model as well as other
models that have been broadly studied, this project includes two new models,
which are the $\textit{o}\textit{w}$CDM model and the
$\textit{o}\textit{w}_0\textit{w}_a$CDM model, to fully evaluate the
correlations between the cosmological parameters by performing the MCMC
algorithm and to explore the geometry and mass content of the Universe.
Combining the measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) with the SNe Ia constraints, the matter
density parameter $\Omega_M = 0.328^{+0.018}_{-0.026}$, the curvature of space
parameter $\Omega_k = 0.0045^{+0.0666}_{-0.0741}$, and the dark energy equation
of state parameter $w = -1.120^{+0.143}_{-0.185}$ are measured for the
$\textit{o}\textit{w}$CDM model. When it comes to the
$\textit{o}\textit{w}_0\textit{w}_a$CDM model, if the parameter $\textit{w}$ is
allowed to evolve with the redshift as $w = w_0 + w_a(1-a)$, the cosmological
parameters are found to be $\Omega_M = 0.344^{+0.018}_{-0.027}$, $\Omega_k =
0.0027^{+0.0665}_{-0.0716}$, $w_0 = -0.739^{+0.336}_{-0.378}$, and $w_a =
-0.812^{+0.750}_{-0.678}$. The parameters of the $\textit{o}\textit{w}$CDM
model and the $\textit{o}\textit{w}_0\textit{w}_a$CDM model are consistent with
the literature results, although the parameter $\textit{w}$ is not well
constrained in both models. The large uncertainties of the parameter
$\textit{w}$ can be reduced by running more steps for the MCMC algorithm to
better constrain the parameters and estimate their uncertainties.

charged particles with energies exceeding $10^{18}$ eV. Identifying their
sources and production mechanism can provide insight into many open questions
in astrophysics and high energy physics. However, the Galactic magnetic field
(GMF) deflects UHECRs, and the high uncertainties in our current understanding
of the $3$-dimensional structure of the GMF does not permit us to accurately
determine their true arrival direction on the plane of the sky (PoS). This
difficulty arises from the fact that currently all GMF observations are
integrated along the line-of-sight (LoS). Upcoming stellar optopolarimetric
surveys as well as Gaia data on stellar parallaxes, are expected to provide
local measurements of the GMF in the near future. In this paper, we evaluate
the reconstruction of the GMF in a limited region of the Galaxy given sparse
and local GMF measurements within that region, through Bayesian inference using
principles of Information Field Theory. We backtrack UHECRs through GMF
configurations drawn from the posterior to improve our knowledge of their true
arrival directions. We show that, for a weakly turbulent GMF, it is possible to
correct for its effect on the observed arrival direction of UHECRs to within
$\sim 3^\circ$. For completely turbulent fields, we show that our procedure can
still be used to significantly improve our knowledge on the true arrival
direction of UHECRs.

learning is further incorporated into this self-taught, mask embedding scheme,
so as to ensure the generic nature of the learnt representation and avoid

randomized range sketching for individual off-diagonal blocks, the construction
process of the hierarchical covariance approximation requires $O(\log{n})$

$O(n\log^2{n})$ effort per iteration. We propose a new approach to compute

underlying a mixture $X$, and show that the behaviour of a generic BSS-solution

be profitably analysed in the form of explicit continuity guarantees with
respect to this topology. This allows for a flexible and convenient
quantification of general model uncertainty scenarios and amounts to the first
comprehensive robustness framework for BSS. Our approach is entirely

that this omission stems, in part, from what we call the relational problem in
socio-technical discourse: fundamental ontological issues have not yet been
settled-including semantic ambiguity, a lack of clear relations between
concepts and differing standard terminologies. This contributes to the
persistence of disparate modes of reasoning to assess institutional AI systems,
and the prevalence of conceptual isolation in the fields that study them
including ML, human factors, social science and policy. After developing this
critique, we offer a way forward by proposing a simple policy and research
design tool in the form of a conceptual framework to organize terms across

and related methods: Operational, epistemic, and normative. We first situate
this framework against the backdrop of recent socio-technical discourse at two

suitable metrics, standards, and mechanisms can be aided by operationalizing
relevant concepts in each of these domains. Finally, we outline outstanding
questions for developing this relational approach to institutional AI research

transport of oxygen toward the center of WDs, resulting in a more compact
structure that liberates gravitational energy as additional heating that
modestly slows WD cooling timescales. We quantify this cooling delay in MESA
C/O WD models over the mass range 0.5-1.0 $M_\odot$, finding delays of 0.5-0.8
Gyr for typical C/O interior profiles. MESA WD cooling timescales including
this effect are generally comparable to other WD evolution models that make
similar assumptions about input physics. When considering phase separation
alongside $^{22}$Ne sedimentation, however, we find that both MESA and BaSTI WD
cooling models predict a more modest sedimentation delay than the latest LPCODE

solutions to some WD cooling anomalies that were based on LPCODE models of
$^{22}$Ne sedimentation. Our implementation of C/O phase separation in the

scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) to study a single quintuple layer (QL) of
the van der Waals magnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) that is grown on Bi2Te3 via molecular
beam epitaxy. STM topographic images show that the FGT grows as free-standing
islands on Bi2Te3 and outwards from Bi2Te3 steps. Atomic resolution imaging
shows atomic lattices of 390 +- 10 pm for FGT and 430 +- 10 pm for Bi2Te3,
consistent with the respective bulk crystals. A moir\'e pattern is observed on
FGT regions with a periodicity of 4.3 +- 0.4 nm that can be attributed solely
to this lattice mismatch and thus indicates zero rotational misalignments.
While most of the surface is covered by a single QL of the FGT, there are small
double QL regions, as well as regions with distinct chemical terminations due
to an incomplete QL. The most common partial QL surface termination is the FeGe
layer, in which the top two atomic layers are missing. This termination has a
distinctive electronic structure and a (sqrt3 x sqrt3)R30 reconstruction
overlaid on the moir\'e pattern in STM images.

thermal management applications, including peak load shifting for reducing
energy demand and cost of HVAC or providing supplemental heat rejection in
transient thermal management systems. However, real-time feedback control of
such devices is currently limited by the absence of suitable state of charge
estimation techniques, given the nonlinearities associated with phase change
dynamics. In this paper we design and experimentally validate a state-dependent
Riccati equation (SDRE) filter for state of charge estimation in a phase change
material (PCM)-based TES device integrated into a single-phase thermal-fluid
loop. The advantage of the SDRE filter is that it does not require
linearization of the nonlinear finite-volume model; instead, it uses a linear
parameter-varying system model which can be quickly derived using graph-based
methods. We leverage graph-based methods to prove that the system model is
uniformly detectable, guaranteeing that the state estimates are bounded. Using
measurements from five thermocouples embedded in the PCM of the TES and two
thermocouples measuring the fluid temperature at the inlet and outlet of the
device, the state estimator uses a reduced-order finite-volume model to
determine the temperature distribution inside the PCM and in turn, the state of
charge of the device. We demonstrate the state estimator in simulation and on
experimental data collected from a thermal management system testbed to show
that the state estimation error converges near zero and remains bounded.

retrieval model matches the tweets with fact-checked information by ranking
verified claims according to their relevance with the input tweet. Both models
are based on pre-trained language models and fine-tuned to perform a text

particular, to validate the effectiveness of our methodology, we consider 83

their interaction with AuNPs by combining microscopic, scattering, and optical

a linear correlation between the membrane coverage and a spectral descriptor

We also consider the impact of linear, quadratic, and focusing phase shift
profiles across the IRS on the power collected at the Rx lens for different IRS
sizes. Our results reveal that surprisingly the powers received for the
different phase shift profiles are identical, unless the IRS operates in the
saturation regime. Moreover, IRSs employing the focusing (linear) phase shift
profile require the largest (smallest) size to reach the saturation regime. We
also compare optical IRSs in different power scaling regimes with optical
relays in terms of the outage probability, diversity and coding gains, and
optimal placement. Our results show that, at the expense of a higher hardware
complexity, relay-assisted FSO links yield a better outage performance at high

shorter, is one of the most solid candidates for a linguistic universal, in the
sense that it has the potential for being exceptionless or with a number of
exceptions that is vanishingly small compared to the number of languages on
Earth. Since Zipf's pioneering research, this law has been viewed as a
manifestation of a universal principle of communication, i.e. the minimization
of word lengths, to reduce the effort of communication. Here we revisit the
concordance of written language with the law of abbreviation. Crucially, we
provide wider evidence that the law holds also in speech (when word length is
measured in time), in particular in 46 languages from 14 linguistic families.
Agreement with the law of abbreviation provides indirect evidence of
compression of languages via the theoretical argument that the law of
abbreviation is a prediction of optimal coding. Motivated by the need of direct
evidence of compression, we derive a simple formula for a random baseline
indicating that word lengths are systematically below chance, across linguistic
families and writing systems, and independently of the unit of measurement
(length in characters or duration in time). Our work paves the way to measure
and compare the degree of optimality of word lengths in languages.

investigated the pronouns associated with each task. Based on translating each
task 100 times in different permutations, we identify a significant disparity
in the gendered pronoun associations with different tasks. Specifically,
requirements elicitation was associated with the pronoun ""he"" in only 6% of
cases, while testing was associated with ""he"" in 100% of cases. Additionally,
tasks related to helping others had a 91% association with ""he"" while the same
association for tasks related to asking coworkers was only 52%. These findings
reveal a clear pattern of gender bias related to software development tasks and
have important implications for addressing this issue both in the training of
large language models and in broader society.

a dual-branch network to extract the deep features and pose features

observations of galaxies in and around the cluster A2626. The cluster can
effectively be divided in three different environments: the cluster itself, a
group environment in the periphery of the cluster (we call it the Swarm) and
substructure in the cluster itself. We use these to study the dependence of
galaxy properties on environment. Aims: We have explored the relationship
between HI deficiency, HI morphology, and star formation deficiency for the
galaxies in and around the A2626 galaxy cluster to investigate the
environmental effects on those properties. Methods: To quantify asymmetries of
the outer HI disc of a galaxy, we used 1) three visual classes based on the
outermost reliable HI contour (settled, disturbed, unsettled HI discs), 2) the
offset between the HI centre and the optical centre of a galaxy, and 3) the
modified asymmetry parameter Amod as defined by Lelli et al. (2014). Results:
The HI deficiency of a galaxy is strongly correlated with the projected
distance from the centre of A2626. Furthermore, substructure galaxies tend to
be more asymmetric than the isolated galaxies in A2626, plausibly because of
more efficient tidal interactions within substructures than outside
substructures. Moreover, asymmetric, offset, and smaller HI discs are not
necessarily the result of the cluster environment, as they are also observed in
substructures in A2626 and in the Swarm. This signifies that ""pre-processing""
of the HI discs of galaxies in groups or substructures plays an important role,
together with the ""processing"" in the cluster environment. Finally, the
galaxies in all three environments have slightly lower star-formation rates
(SFRs) than the typical SFR for normal galaxies as manifested by their offset
from the star formation main sequence, implying effective gas removal
mechanisms in all three environments.

in isotropic, anisotropic, and band-mass asymmetric Luttinger semimetals

bandstructure, where the upper and lower branches of dispersion are doubly
degenrate. While a nonzero temperature ($T$) can excite particle-hole pairs
about the Fermi level due to thermal effects (even at zero doping), a finite
doping ($\mu$) sets the Fermi level away from the QBCP at any $T$, leading to a
finite Fermi surface (rather than a Fermi point). Both these conditions
naturally give rise to a finite density of states. A nonzero value of $T$ or
$\mu$ is thus a necessary condition for a plasmon to exist, as otherwise the
zero density of states at the QBCP can never lead to the appearance of this
collective mode. In addition to $T$ and $\mu$, we consider the effects of all
possible parameters like cubic anisotropy, band-mass asymmetry, and a
material-dependent parameter $X$, to numerically compute the quasiparticle
damping rate $\tau$ resulting from screened Coulomb interactions. A
well-defined sharp peak in the profile of the inelastic scattering rate
$\tau^{-1}$ signals the appearance of a plasmon. From our results, we conclude
that $X$ turns out to be a crucial tuning parameter, as higher values of $X$
assist in the emergence of plasmons. On the other hand, the features are
broadly insensitive to cubic anisotropy and band-mass asymmetry.

uncertainty-weighted value-targeted regression with exploration-driven

of paramount importance from the laboratory scale controlled fracture
experiment to the largest scale of mechanical failure i.e., earthquakes. It has
been long conjectured that the statistical regularities in the energy emission
time series mirrors the health of such driven systems and hence have the
potential for predicting imminent catastrophe. Here we use the fiber bundle
model (FBM) and Random fuse model (RFM) of fracture and record the time series
of avalanche sizes. Such avalanches are necessarily very much unequal. These
inequalities in the avalanche time series play an important role in predicting
imminent failure. These inequalities are quantified through some indices,
namely the Hirsch-index h, Gini index g, and Kolkata index k that are estimated
from the Lorenz function L(p) where the p fraction of avalanche size acquires
the cumulative fraction of avalanche mass when arranged in the ascending order
of their sizes. Here we calculate these inequalities indices using the time
series of avalanche size. In the mean-field case of the FBM, we can calculate
h, g, and k analytically: these inequalities endpoints or terminal values can
be a very good indicator of imminent catastrophic failure. For non-mean field
cases, we give numerical results. These inequalities of avalanche size show
universal scaling properties near the failure point.

retained and is virtually independent of the chosen model. The only
model-dependent feature is the degree of gapping in $\sigma_{1}(\omega)$. In
all cases the extracted optical properties reflect the presence of residual
quasiparticles, which at finite temperatures are inevitably present alongside

and a maximal intracluster medium cooling rate of 1900+/-400 Msun/yr. This
prodigious cooling may be responsible for fueling extended, star-forming
filaments observed in Hubble Space Telescope imaging. Based on new
spectrophotometric data, we detect bright [O II] emission in the BCG, implying
an unobscured star formation rate (SFR) of 320^{+230}_{-140} Msun/yr. The
detection of a weak radio source (2.0+/-0.8 mJy at 0.8 GHz) suggests ongoing
feedback from an active galactic nucleus (AGN), though the implied jet power is
less than half the cooling luminosity of the hot gas, consistent with cooling
overpowering heating. The extreme cooling and SFR of SPT2215 is rare among
known cool core clusters, and it is even more remarkable that we observe these
at such high redshift, when most clusters are still dynamically disturbed. The
high mass of this cluster, coupled with the fact that it is dynamically relaxed
with a highly-isolated BCG, suggests that it is an exceptionally rare system
that must have formed very rapidly in the early Universe. Combined with the
high SFR, SPT2215 may be a high-z analog of the Phoenix cluster, potentially
providing insight into the limits of AGN feedback and star formation in the

already included within the input stellar tracks. METISSE's implementation of
mass loss (applied to tracks without mass loss) shows excellent agreement with
the SSE fitting formulae and with detailed MESA tracks, except in cases where
the mass transfer is too rapid for the star to maintain equilibrium. We use
this updated version of METISSE within the binary population synthesis code BSE
to demonstrate the impact of varying stellar evolution parameters, particularly
core overshooting, on the evolution of a massive (25M$_\odot$ and 15M$_\odot$)
binary system with an orbital period of 1800 days. Depending on the input
tracks, we find that the binary system can form a binary black hole or a black

between 4.47(1.36)M$_\odot$ and 12.30(10.89)M$_\odot$, and orbital periods
ranging from 6 days to the binary becoming unbound. Extending this analysis to
a population of isolated binaries uniformly distributed in mass and orbital
period, we show that the input stellar models play an important role in
determining which regions of the binary parameter space can produce compact
binary mergers, paving the way for current and future gravitational-wave

of BHs in the nearest open cluster to the Sun - the Hyades - by comparing
density profiles of direct $N$-body models to data from $Gaia$. The
observations are best reproduced by models with $2-3$ BHs at present. Models
that never possessed BHs have an half-mass radius $\sim30\%$ smaller than the
observed value, while those where the last BHs were ejected recently
($\lesssim150~$Myr ago) can still reproduce the density profile. In 50% of the
models hosting BHs, we find BHs with stellar companion(s). Their period
distribution peaks at $\sim10^3$ yr, making them unlikely to be found through
velocity variations. We look for potential BH companions through large $Gaia$
astrometric and spectroscopic errors, identifying 56 binary candidates - none
of which consistent with a massive compact companion. Models with $2-3$ BHs
have an elevated central velocity dispersion, but observations can not yet
discriminate. We conclude that the present-day structure of the Hyades requires
a significant fraction of BHs to receive natal kicks smaller than the escape
velocity of $\sim 3\, \mathrm{km \, s^{-1}}$ at the time of BH formation and
that the nearest BHs to the Sun are in, or near, Hyades.

domain gap between simulations and real data. While deep learning-based domain
transfer using Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks and similar architectures
has led to substantial progress in the field, there are use cases in which
state-of-the-art approaches still fail to generate training images that produce
convincing results on relevant downstream tasks. Here, we address this issue
with a domain transfer approach based on conditional invertible neural networks
(cINNs). As a particular advantage, our method inherently guarantees cycle
consistency through its invertible architecture, and network training can
efficiently be conducted with maximum likelihood training. To showcase our
method's generic applicability, we apply it to two spectral imaging modalities
at different scales, namely hyperspectral imaging (pixel-level) and
photoacoustic tomography (image-level). According to comprehensive experiments,
our method enables the generation of realistic spectral data and outperforms
the state of the art on two downstream classification tasks (binary and
multi-class). cINN-based domain transfer could thus evolve as an important
method for realistic synthetic data generation in the field of spectral imaging
and beyond.

with $k_\perp d_i\gtrsim 1$. At these scales, the waves become significantly
compressive, unlike in MHD, due to the Hall term in the equations. We
demonstrate that when frequencies are small compared to the ion gyrofrequency
and amplitudes small compared to unity, no new nonlinear interaction appears
due to the Hall term alone at the lowest non-trivial order, even when $k_\perp
d_i \sim 1$. However, at the second non-trivial order, we discover that the
Hall physics leads to a slow but resonant nonlinear interaction between
co-propagating Alfv\'en waves, an inherently 3D effect. Including the effects
of finite temperature, finite frequency, and electron inertia, the two-fluid
Alfv\'en wave also becomes dispersive once one or more of $k_\perp \rho_s$,
$k_\perp d_e$, or $k_\parallel d_i$ becomes significant: for oblique waves at
low $\beta$ as studied here, this can be at a much smaller scale than $d_i$. We
show that the timescale for one-dimensional steepening of two-fluid Alfven
waves is only significant at these smaller dispersive scales, and also derive
an expression for the amplitude of driven harmonics of a primary wave.
Importantly, both new effects are absent in gyrokinetics and other commonly
used reduced two-fluid models. Our calculations have relevance for the
interpretation of laboratory Alfv\'en wave experiments, as well as shedding
light on the physics of turbulence in the solar corona and inner solar wind,
where the dominant nonlinear interaction between counter-propagating waves is
suppressed, allowing these new effects to become important.

the atomic displacements linearly modulate the nearest-neighbor hopping
integrals. Focusing on an optical variant of the model in the strongly
correlated limit relevant for cuprate spin chains, we examine how the SSH
interaction modifies the model's ground and excited state properties. The SSH
coupling weakly renormalizes the model's single- and two-particle response
functions for electron-phonon ($e$-ph) coupling strengths below a
parameter-dependent critical value $g_\mathrm{c}$. For larger $e$-ph coupling,
the sign of the effective hopping integrals changes for a subset of orbitals,
which drives a lattice dimerization distinct from the standard nesting-driven
picture in 1D. The spectral weight of the one- and two-particle dynamical
response functions are dramatically rearranged across this transition, with
significant changes in the ground state correlations. We argue that this
dimerization results from the breakdown of the linear approximation for the
$e$-ph coupling and thus signals a fundamental limitation of the linear SSH
interaction. Our results have consequences for our understanding of how
SSH-like interactions can enter the physics of strongly correlated quantum
materials, including the recently synthesized doped cuprate spin chains.

relevant to quantum state synthesis, where an initial direct-product state is
sought to be converted into a highly entangled target state. In devices based
on pairwise exchange interactions, such a process can be carried out and
optimized in various ways. As a benchmark problem, we consider the task of
spreading one excitation among $N$ two-level atoms or qubits. Starting from an
initial state where one qubit is excited, we seek a target state where all
qubits have the same excitation-amplitude -- a generalized-W state. This target
is to be reached by suitably chosen pairwise exchange interactions. For
example, we may have a a setup where any pair of qubits can be brought into
proximity for a controllable period of time. We describe three protocols that
accomplish this task, each with $N-1$ tightly-constrained steps. In the first,
one atom acts as a flying qubit that sequentially interacts with all others. In
the second, qubits interact pairwise in sequential order. In these two cases,
the required interaction times follow a pattern with an elegant geometric
interpretation. They correspond to angles within the spiral of Theodorus -- a
construction known for more than two millennia. The third protocol follows a
divide-and-conquer approach -- dividing equally between two qubits at each
step. For large $N$, the flying-qubit protocol yields a total interaction time
that scales as $\sqrt{N}$, while the sequential approach scales linearly with $
N$. For the divide-and-conquer approach, the time has a lower bound that scales
as $\log N$. With any such protocol, we show that the phase differences in the
final state cannot be independently controlled. For instance, a W-state (where
all phases are equal) cannot be generated by pairwise exchange.

topological phases in solid-state systems. It is found, for example, in
free-fermion systems at half filling, and it is closely related to the notion
of antiparticles in relativistic field theories. In the low energy limit,
graphene is a prime example of a gapless particle-hole symmetric system
described by an effective Dirac equation, where topological phases can be
understood by studying ways to open a gap by preserving (or breaking)
symmetries. An important example is the intrinsic Kane-Mele spin-orbit gap of
graphene, which leads to a lifting of the spin-valley degeneracy and renders
graphene a topological insulator in a quantum spin Hall phase, while preserving
particle-hole symmetry. Here, we show that bilayer graphene allows realizing
electron-hole double quantum-dots that exhibit nearly perfect particle-hole
symmetry, where transport occurs via the creation and annihilation of single
electron-hole pairs with opposite quantum numbers. Moreover, we show that this
particle-hole symmetry results in a protected single-particle spin-valley
blockade. The latter will allow robust spin-to-charge conversion and
valley-to-charge conversion, which is essential for the operation of spin and

increasingly clinically adopted to enable magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI)-based radiotherapy. Deep learning (DL) has recently demonstrated the
ability to generate accurate sCT from fixed MRI acquisitions. However, MRI
protocols may change over time or differ between centres resulting in
low-quality sCT due to poor model generalisation. Purpose: investigating domain
randomisation (DR) to increase the generalisation of a DL model for brain sCT
generation. Methods: CT and corresponding T1-weighted MRI with/without
contrast, T2-weighted, and FLAIR MRI from 95 patients undergoing RT were
collected, considering FLAIR the unseen sequence where to investigate
generalisation. A ``Baseline'' generative adversarial network was trained
with/without the FLAIR sequence to test how a model performs without DR. Image
similarity and accuracy of sCT-based dose plans were assessed against CT to
select the best-performing DR approach against the Baseline. Results: The
Baseline model had the poorest performance on FLAIR, with mean absolute error
(MAE)=106$\pm$20.7 HU (mean$\pm\sigma$). Performance on FLAIR significantly
improved for the DR model with MAE=99.0$\pm$14.9 HU, but still inferior to the
performance of the Baseline+FLAIR model (MAE=72.6$\pm$10.1 HU). Similarly, an
improvement in $\gamma$-pass rate was obtained for DR vs Baseline. Conclusions:
DR improved image similarity and dose accuracy on the unseen sequence compared
to training only on acquired MRI. DR makes the model more robust, reducing the
need for re-training when applying a model on sequences unseen and unavailable
for retraining.

Since image registration is in general an ill-defined problem, the usefulness
of inductive biases of symmetricity, inverse consistency and topology
preservation has been widely accepted by the research community. However, while
many deep learning registration methods enforce these properties via loss
functions, no prior deep learning registration method fulfills all of these
properties by construct. Here, we propose a novel multi-resolution registration
architecture which is by construct symmetric, inverse consistent, and topology
preserving. We also develop an implicit layer for memory efficient inversion of
the deformation fields. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
registration accuracy on two datasets.

of wind/solar power and the incorporation of new flexible technologies that can
shift load in space and time (e.g., data centers, battery storage, and modular
manufacturing). Load shifting is needed to mitigate space-time fluctuations
associated with wind/solar power and other disruptions (e.g., extreme weather).
The impact of load shifting on electricity markets is typically quantified via
sensitivity analysis, which aims to assess impacts in terms of price volatility
and total welfare. This sensitivity approach does not explicitly quantify
operational flexibility (e.g., range or probability of feasible operation). In
this work, we present a computational framework to enable this; specifically,
we quantify operational flexibility by assessing how much uncertainty in net
loads (which capture uncertain power injections/withdrawals) can be tolerated
by the system under varying levels of load shifting capacity. The proposed
framework combines optimization formulations that quantify operational
flexibility with power grid models that capture load shifting in the form of
virtual links (pathways that transfer load across space-time). Our case studies
reveal that adding a single virtual link that shifts load in either space or
time can lead to dramatic improvements in system-wide flexibility; this is
because shifting relieves space-time congestion that results from transmission
constraints and generator ramping constraints. Our results provide insights
into how the incorporation of flexible technologies can lead to non-intuitive,
system-wide gains in flexibility.

analyse Compound, as well as Reno and Illinois. The models for these TCP

two limiting regimes: a small and an intermediate buffer regime. The topology
we consider has two sets of long-lived TCP flows, each passing through separate
edge routers, which merge at a common core router. Our analysis is inspired by
time delayed coupled oscillators, where we obtain analytical conditions under
which the sets of TCP flows synchronise. These conditions are made explicit in
terms of coupling strengths, which depend on protocol parameters, and on
network parameters like feedback delay, link capacity and buffer sizes. We find
that variations in the coupling strengths can lead to limit cycles in the queue

small Drop-Tail buffers are preferable over intermediate buffers as they can

reliable classification of cervical cancer in Pap smear images. Methods: In
this study, we propose the CerviFormer -- a model that depends on the
Transformers and thereby requires minimal architectural assumptions about the
size of the input data. The model uses a cross-attention technique to
repeatedly consolidate the input data into a compact latent Transformer module,
which enables it to manage very large-scale inputs. We evaluated our model on
two publicly available Pap smear datasets. Results: For 3-state classification
on the Sipakmed data, the model achieved an accuracy of 93.70%. For 2-state
classification on the Herlev data, the model achieved an accuracy of 94.57%.
Conclusion: Experimental results on two publicly accessible datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive results when compared
to contemporary approaches. The proposed method brings forth a comprehensive
classification model to detect cervical cancer in Pap smear images. This may
aid medical professionals in providing better cervical cancer treatment,
consequently, enhancing the overall effectiveness of the entire testing

precise FR is a crucial input to LArTPC detector simulations and charge
reconstruction. Established LArTPC designs have been based on parallel wire
planes. It allows accurate and computationally economic two-dimensional (2D) FR
models utilizing the translational symmetry along the direction of the wires.
Recently, novel LArTPC designs utilize electrodes formed on printed circuit
board (PCB) in the shape of strips with through holes. The translational
symmetry is no longer a good approximation near the electrodes and a new FR
calculation that employs regions with three dimensions (3D) has been developed.
Extending the 2D models to 3D would be computationally expensive. Fortuitously,
the nature of strips with through holes allows for a computationally economic
approach based on the finite-difference method (FDM). In this paper, we present
a new software package ""pochoir"" that calculates LArTPC field response for
these new strip-based anode designs. This package combines 3D calculations in

diversified $\ell_p$ robustness, we propose a novel robust mode connectivity
(RMC)-oriented adversarial defense that contains two population-based learning
phases. The first phase, RMC, is able to search the model parameter space
between two pre-trained models and find a path containing points with high
robustness against diversified $\ell_p$ attacks. In light of the effectiveness
of RMC, we develop a second phase, RMC-based optimization, with RMC serving as
the basic unit for further enhancement of neural network diversified $\ell_p$
robustness. To increase computational efficiency, we incorporate learning with
a self-robust mode connectivity (SRMC) module that enables the fast

parallels between SRMC and the human immune system. Experimental results on

the super-resolution task, in recent years, a series of super-resolution
algorithms have been developed. In this paper, for the super-resolution of UAV
images, a novel network based on the state-of-the-art Swin Transformer is
proposed with better efficiency and competitive accuracy. Meanwhile, as one of
the essential applications of the UAV is land cover and land use monitoring,
simple image quality assessments such as the Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
and the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are not enough to
comprehensively measure the performance of an algorithm. Therefore, we further
investigate the effectiveness of super-resolution methods using the accuracy of
semantic segmentation. The code will be available at

in various programmable quantum simulators and exemplify how non-equilibrium,
driven quantum systems can exhibit intriguing and robust properties absent in
systems at equilibrium. These robust driven states need to be stabilized by
some mechanism, with the preeminent candidates being many-body localization and
prethermalization. This introduces additional constraints that make it
challenging to experimentally observe time crystallinity in naturally occurring
systems. Recent theoretical work has developed the notion of prethermalization
\textit{without temperature}, expanding the class of time crystal systems to
explain time crystalline observations at (or near) infinite temperature. In
this work, we conclusively observe the emergence of a prethermal $U(1)$ time
crystalline state at quasi-infinite temperature in a solid-state NMR quantum
emulator by verifying the requisites of prethermalization without temperature.
In addition to observing the signature period-doubling behavior, we show the
existence of a long-lived prethermal regime whose lifetime is significantly
enhanced by strengthening an emergent $U(1)$ conservation law. Not only do we
measure this enhancement through the global magnetization, but we also exploit
on-site disorder to measure local observables, ruling out the possibility of
many-body localization and confirming the emergence of long-range correlations.

However, when the crystal electric field (CEF) effect results in a spin-singlet

system can either remain non-magnetic, or more intriguingly, the exchange
interactions between neighboring ions, provided they are sufficiently strong,
can admix the excited CEF levels, resulting in a magnetically ordered ground
state. The collective magnetic excitations in such a state are so-called spin
excitons that describe the CEF transitions propagating through the lattice. In
most cases, spin excitons originating from CEF levels of a localized single ion
are dispersion-less in momentum (reciprocal) space and well-defined in both the
magnetically ordered and paramagnetic states. Here we use thermodynamic and
neutron scattering experiments to study stoichiometric Ni2Mo3O8 without site
disorder, where Ni2+ ions form a bipartite honeycomb lattice comprised of two
triangular lattices, with ions subject to the tetrahedral and octahedral
crystalline environment, respectively. We find that in both types of ions, the
CEF excitations have nonmagnetic singlet ground states, yet the material has
long-range magnetic order. Furthermore, CEF spin excitons from the
triangular-lattice arrangement of tetrahedral sites form, in both the
antiferromagnetic and paramagnetic states, a dispersive diffusive pattern
around the Brillouin zone boundary in reciprocal space. The present work thus
demonstrates that spin excitons in an ideal triangular lattice magnet can have
dispersive excitations, irrespective of the existence of static magnetic order,
and this phenomenon is most likely due to spin entanglement and geometric
frustrations.

vector machines (SVMs), which tackles federated classification and regression.
The proposed method utilizes efficient computations and model exchange in a
network of heterogeneous nodes and allows personalization of the learning model
in the presence of non-i.i.d. data. To further enhance privacy, we introduce a
random mask procedure that helps avoid data inversion. Finally, we analyze the
impact of the proposed privacy mechanisms and participant hardware and data

how the capabilities and limitations of the IA influence user behavior over

delay or reduce subsequent interactions in the short term via an observational
study. Next, we expand the time horizon to examine behavior changes and show
that as users discover the limitations of the IA's understanding and functional
capabilities, they learn to adjust the scope and wording of their requests to
increase the likelihood of receiving a helpful response from the IA. Our
findings highlight the impact of the feedback effect at both the micro and meso

observation that even though the individual components are described using both
algebraic and differential equations, their coupling only involves algebraic
equations. Following this observation, we use Neural Networks (NNs) to
approximate the components' state evolution, leading to fast, accurate, and
numerically stable approximators, which enable larger time-steps. To account
for effects of the network on the components and vice-versa, the NNs take the
temporal evolution of the coupling algebraic variables as an input for their
prediction. We initially estimate this temporal evolution and then update it in
an iterative fashion using the Newton-Raphson algorithm. The involved Jacobian

compact star, a Central Compact Object named XMMU J173203.3-344518 inside the
supernova remnant HESS J1731-347. Its tiny mass is at odds with all
calculations of minimum masses of neutron stars generated by iron cores,
therefore (and even if not compellingly) it has been suggested to be a {\it
strange star}. Besides the mass, a radius and surface temperature have been
extracted from data, and the whole body of information should ultimately reveal
if this object is truly consistent with an exotic composition.
  Aims: To understand the status of the compact object XMMU J173203.3-344518 in
HESS J1731-347 within the existing models of strange stars, including its
prompt formation.
  Methods: The information obtained on the mass, radius and surface temperature
are compared to theoretical calculations performed within usual theoretical
models using General Relativity as the assumed theory of gravitation and a
handful of cooling scenarios. A qualitative discussion showing the consistency
of the strange-matter driven supernova scenario with a low-mass compact star is
provided.
  Results: We found that the object HESS J1731-347 fits within the same quark
star models recently employed to explain the masses and radii of the NICER
objects PSR J040+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, in which both quantities were
simultaneously determined. It is also remarkable to find that a simple cooling
scenario devised $30\text{ yr}$ ago with superconducting quarks provides an
overall good explanation of the surface temperature.
  Conclusions: We conclude that XMMU J173203.3-344518 in the remnant HESS
J1731-347 fits into a ``strange star'' scenario that is also consistent with
heavier compact stars, which can also belong to the same class and constitute
an homogeneous type of self-bound objects produced in Nature.

  Confidence",,,,,"cs.CV cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a new methodology to alleviate the fundamental trade-off
between accuracy and latency in spiking neural networks (SNNs). The approach
involves decoding confidence information over time from the SNN outputs and
using it to develop a decision-making agent that can dynamically determine when
to terminate each inference.
  The proposed method, Dynamic Confidence, provides several significant
benefits to SNNs. 1. It can effectively optimize latency dynamically at
runtime, setting it apart from many existing low-latency SNN algorithms. Our
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets have demonstrated an average 40%
speedup across eight different settings after applying Dynamic Confidence. 2.
The decision-making agent in Dynamic Confidence is straightforward to construct
and highly robust in parameter space, making it extremely easy to implement. 3.
The proposed method enables visualizing the potential of any given SNN, which
sets a target for current SNNs to approach. For instance, if an SNN can
terminate at the most appropriate time point for each input sample, a ResNet-50
SNN can achieve an accuracy as high as 82.47% on ImageNet within just 4.71 time
steps on average. Unlocking the potential of SNNs needs a highly-reliable
decision-making agent to be constructed and fed with a high-quality estimation
of ground truth. In this regard, Dynamic Confidence represents a meaningful
step toward realizing the potential of SNNs.

introduced to address the problem. To ensure safety in the presence of control
limits, we need to design an energy function that results in persistently
feasible safe control at all system states. However, designing such an energy
function for high-dimensional nonlinear systems remains challenging.
Considering the fact that there are redundant dynamics in high dimensional
systems with respect to the safety specifications, this paper proposes a novel
approach called abstract safe control. We propose a system abstraction method
that enables the design of energy functions on a low-dimensional model. Then we
can synthesize the energy function with respect to the low-dimensional model to
ensure persistent feasibility. The resulting safe controller can be directly
transferred to other systems with the same abstraction, e.g., when a robot arm
holds different tools. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a 7-DoF robot
arm (14 states) both in simulation and real-world. Our method always finds
feasible control and achieves zero safety violations in 500 trials on 5
different systems.

subtasks, and based on the requirements of these specific subtasks, specific,
robust, continuous controllers are constructed. This approach allows for less
stiff and thus saver, and cheaper hardware to be used. For a planar
pick-and-place operation, it was found that this results in energy savings of
more than 30%. However, when the payload moves with the natural dynamics, there
is less control of the followed trajectory and its timing compared to a

Synthetic data has shown promise as a way to avoid the substantial costs and
potential ethical concerns associated with collecting and labeling enormous
amounts of data in the real-world. However, synthetic data may differ from real
data in important ways. This phenomenon, known as \textit{domain shift}, can
limit the utility of synthetic data in robotics applications. To mitigate the
effects of domain shift, substantial effort is being dedicated to the
development of domain adaptation (DA) techniques. Yet, much remains to be
understood about how best to develop these techniques. In this paper, we
introduce a new dataset called Robot Control Gestures (RoCoG-v2). The dataset
is composed of both real and synthetic videos from seven gesture classes, and
is intended to support the study of synthetic-to-real domain shift for

$\varphi(e)$ lies in the interval $[1,r-1]$ and, for every vertex, the incoming

numbers $r$ such that $G$ admits a complex nowhere-zero $r$-flow. The exact
computation of $\phi_{\mathbb{C}}$ seems to be a hard task even for very small
and symmetric graphs. In particular, the exact value of $\phi_{\mathbb{C}}$ is
known only for families of graphs where a lower bound can be trivially proved.

which may be easier to analyze, simulate, control, and provides a convenient
parametrization for learning. This paper presents novel theory, algorithms and
software capabilities for quadratization of non-autonomous ODEs. We provide
existence results, depending on the regularity of the input function, for cases
when a quadratic-bilinear system can be obtained through quadratization. We
further develop existence results and an algorithm that generalizes the process
of quadratization for systems with arbitrary dimension that retain the
nonlinear structure when the dimension grows. For such systems, we provide
dimension-agnostic quadratization. An example is semi-discretized PDEs, where
the nonlinear terms remain symbolically identical when the discretization size
increases. As an important aspect for practical adoption of this research, we
extended the capabilities of the QBee software towards both non-autonomous
systems of ODEs and ODEs with arbitrary dimension. We present several examples
of ODEs that were previously reported in the literature, and where our new
algorithms find quadratized ODE systems with lower dimension than the
previously reported lifting transformations. We further highlight an important
area of quadratization: reduced-order model learning. This area can benefit
significantly from working in the optimal lifting variables, where quadratic
models provide a direct parametrization of the model that also avoids
additional hyperreduction for the nonlinear terms. A solar wind example
highlights these advantages.

COVID-19 cases per day given the last 14 days of environmental and mobility
data.
  Approach: COVID-19 data from four counties around Toronto, Ontario, were
used. Data were prepared into daily records containing the number of new COVID
case counts, patient demographic data, outdoor weather variables, indoor
environment factors, and human movement based on cell mobility and public
health restrictions. This data was analyzed to determine the most important
variables and their interactions. Predictive models were developed using CNN
and LSTM deep neural network approaches. A 5-fold chronological
cross-validation approach used these methods to develop predictive models using
data from Mar 1 to Oct 14 2020, and test them on data covering Oct 15 to Dec 24
2020. Results: The best LSTM models forecasted tomorrow's daily COVID case
counts with 90.7% accuracy, and the 7-day rolling average COVID case counts
with 98.1% accuracy using independent test data. The best models to forecast
the next 7 days of daily COVID case counts did so with 79.4% accuracy over all
days. Models forecasting the 7-day rolling average case counts had a mean
accuracy of 83.6% on the same test set.
  Conclusions: Our findings point to the importance of indoor humidity for the
transmission of a virus such as COVID-19. During the coldest portions of the
year, when humans spend greater amounts of time indoors or in vehicles, air
quality drops within buildings, most significantly indoor relative humidity
levels. Moderate to high indoor temperatures coupled with low IRH (below 20%)
create conditions where viral transmission is more likely because water vapour
ejected from an infected person's mouth can remain longer in the air because of
evaporation and dry skin conditions, particularly in a recipient's airway,
promotes transmission.

in statistical physics, and attempts to understand the origin of recurrences in
the system have led to many great advances in nonlinear dynamics and
mathematical physics. In this work we revisit the problem and study
quasiperiodic recurrences in the weakly nonlinear $\alpha-$FPUT system in more
detail. We aim to reconstruct the quasiperiodic behaviour observed in the
original paper from the canonical transformation used to remove the three wave
interactions, which is necessary before applying the wave turbulence formalism.
We expect the construction to match the observed quasiperiodicity if we are in
the weakly nonlinear regime. Surprisingly, in our work we show that this is not
always the case and in particular, the recurrences observed in the original
paper cannot be constructed by our method. We attribute this disagreement to
the presence of small denominators in the canonical transformation used to
remove the three wave interactions before arriving at the starting point of
wave turbulence. We also show that these small denominators are present even in
the weakly nonlinear regime, and they become more significant as the system
size is increased. We also discuss our results in the context of the problem of
equilibration in the $\alpha-$FPUT system, and point out some mathematical
challenges when the wave turbulence formalism is applied to explain
thermalization in the $\alpha-$FPUT problem. We argue that certain aspects of
the $\alpha-$FPUT system such as presence of the stochasticity threshold,
thermalization in the thermodynamic limit and the cause of quasiperiodicity are
not clear, and that they require further mathematical and numerical studies.

For example, the ensemble-averaged shear modulus $\left\langle G \right\rangle$
increases as a power-law in pressure $p$ for static packings of spherical
particles that can rearrange during compression. We seek to design granular
materials with shear moduli that can either increase {\it or} decrease with
pressure without particle rearrangements even in the large-system limit. To do
this, we construct {\it tessellated} granular metamaterials by joining multiple
particle-filled cells together. We focus on cells that contain a small number
of bidisperse disks in two dimensions. We first study the mechanical properties
of individual disk-filled cells with three types of boundaries: periodic
boundary conditions, fixed-length walls, and flexible walls. Hypostatic jammed
packings are found for disk-filled cells with flexible walls, but not in cells
with periodic boundary conditions and fixed-length walls, and they are
stabilized by quartic modes of the dynamical matrix. The shear modulus of a
single cell depends linearly on $p$. We find that the slope of the shear
modulus with pressure, $\lambda_c < 0$ for all packings in single cells with
periodic boundary conditions where the number of particles per cell $N \ge 6$.
In contrast, single cells with fixed-length and flexible walls can possess
$\lambda_c > 0$, as well as $\lambda_c < 0$, for $N \le 16$. We show that we
can force the mechanical properties of multi-cell granular metamaterials to
possess those of single cells by constraining the endpoints of the outer walls
and enforcing an affine shear response. These studies demonstrate that
tessellated granular metamaterials provide a novel platform for the design of
soft materials with novel mechanical properties.

finding the optimal budget split among the individual component POMDPs. The

as a way to reduce the runtime for producing the sparse regression weights of

doing so, we discover difficulties in the task of making a useful private

theoretical arguments and experimental evidence that this difficulty arises
from the screening step itself and not the private optimizer. Based on our
results, we highlight that developing an effective private $L_1$ screening
method is an open problem in the differential privacy literature.

half space. We prove that the positive solutions are strictly increasing in
$x_1$ direction without assuming the solutions be bounded.
  So far as we know, this is the first paper to explore the monotonicity of
possibly unbounded solutions for the nonlocal parabolic problem involving both
the fractional time derivative $\partial_t^\alpha$ and the fractional Laplacian
$(-\Delta)^s$. To overcome the difficulties caused by the dual nonlocality in
space-time and by the remarkably weak assumptions on solutions, we introduced
several new ideas and our approaches are quite different from those in the
previous literature. We first establish an unbounded narrow region principle
without imposing any decay and boundedness assumptions on the antisymmetric
functions at infinity by estimating the nonlocal operator
$\partial_t^\alpha+(-\Delta)^s$ along a sequence of suitable auxiliary
functions at their minimum points, which is an essential ingredient to carry
out the method of moving planes at the starting point. Then in order to remove
the decay or bounded-ness assumption on the solutions, we develop a new novel
approach lies in establishing the {\em averaging effects} for such nonlocal
operator and apply these {\em averaging effects} twice to guarantee that the
plane can be moved all the way to infinity to derive the monotonicity of
solutions.
  We believe that the new ideas and techniques developed here will become very
useful tools in studying the qualitative properties of solutions, in particular
of those unbounded solutions, for a wide range of fractional elliptic and
parabolic problems.

regressor of interest are assigned randomly and independently of other
regressors. We find that the OLS variance formula in this case is often
simplified, sometimes substantially. In particular, when the regressor of
interest is independent not only of other regressors but also of the error
term, the textbook homoskedastic variance formula is valid even if the error
term and auxiliary regressors exhibit a general dependence structure. In the
context of randomized controlled trials, this conclusion holds in completely
randomized experiments with constant treatment effects. When the error term is
heteroscedastic with respect to the regressor of interest, the variance formula
has to be adjusted not only for heteroscedasticity but also for correlation
structure of the error term. However, even in the latter case, some
simplifications are possible as only a part of the correlation structure of the

trials, this implies that the textbook homoscedastic variance formula is
typically not valid if treatment effects are heterogenous but
heteroscedasticity-robust variance formulas are valid if treatment effects are
independent across units, even if the error term exhibits a general dependence

Therefore, we propose an abstract and universal edge supervision method called

multi-scale finite element method) in the Eulerian framework using the fixed
mesh. The incompressible N-S equation with high Reynolds number is stabilized
using the idea of the VMS stabilization. To model the multiphase materials, a
modified level set method is used to track the development of interfaces
between different phases of materials. The interaction between the materials
and the rigid body structure is realized using the Lagrangian multiplier
method. The mesh of the rigid body structure domain is incompatible with the
Eulerian fixed mesh for material domains. A cutting finite element scheme is
used to satisfy the coupling condition between the rigid body structure
boundary and the deformeable multiphase materials. A novel algorithm is
proposed to track the stress history of the material point in the Eulerian
fixed-mesh framework such that the stress-history-dependent fluid or solid
materials (e.g. as soil) are also analysable using fixed-mesh. The non-local
stress theory is used. To consider the stress-history-dependent material in the
Eulerian fixed mesh, in the step of calculating the non-local
relative-distance-based averaging treatment, the field point location is based
on the updated material point position,rather than the spatial field point
location. Thus, the convective effect of the previous stress history and the
calculation of the non-local stress fields are realized in one shot. Thus, the
proposed novel VMS-FEM can solve almost any history-dependent materials (fluid

when dealing with new data from a different domain, where collecting a large
labeled dataset and training a new classifier from scratch is time-consuming,
expensive, and sometimes infeasible or impossible. Cross-domain classification
frameworks were developed to handle this data domain shift problem by utilizing
unsupervised image-to-image (UI2I) translation models to translate an input
image from the unlabeled domain to the labeled domain. The problem with these
unsupervised models lies in their unsupervised nature. For lack of annotations,
it is not possible to use the traditional supervised metrics to evaluate these
translation models to pick the best-saved checkpoint model. In this paper, we
introduce a new method called Pseudo Supervised Metrics that was designed
specifically to support cross-domain classification applications contrary to
other typically used metrics such as the FID which was designed to evaluate the
model in terms of the quality of the generated image from a human-eye
perspective. We show that our metric not only outperforms unsupervised metrics
such as the FID, but is also highly correlated with the true supervised
metrics, robust, and explainable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it can be
used as a standard metric for future research in this field by applying it to a

is fear speech. Fear speech, as the name suggests, attempts to incite fear
about a target community. Although subtle, it might be highly effective, often
pushing communities toward a physical conflict. Therefore, understanding their
prevalence in social media is of paramount importance. This article presents a

700K hate speech posts collected from Gab.com. Remarkably, users posting a
large number of fear speech accrue more followers and occupy more central
positions in social networks than users posting a large number of hate speech.
They can also reach out to benign users more effectively than hate speech users
through replies, reposts, and mentions. This connects to the fact that, unlike
hate speech, fear speech has almost zero toxic content, making it look
plausible. Moreover, while fear speech topics mostly portray a community as a
perpetrator using a (fake) chain of argumentation, hate speech topics hurl
direct multitarget insults, thus pointing to why general users could be more
gullible to fear speech. Our findings transcend even to other platforms

the significant progress has been achieved by existing computational models,
they have overlooked the important high-level semantic information and

information is rich and it can be represented by the edges of graphs in drug
combination predictions. In this work, we propose a novel Edge-based Graph

achieves 7.92 times suppression of SEP events at 2103 keV with a 57.43 %

137Cs sources was carried out by using the self-developed strip multi-electrode
high-purity germanium detector prototype measurement system and compared with
the simulation results. The results show that the discrimination effect of the
PSD method on the experimental waveform is relatively consistent with that of
the simulated waveform. The PSD method was used to identify the
0{\nu}\b{eta}\b{eta} background events of 76Ge. The survival rate of
0{\nu}\b{eta}\b{eta} events was 49.16 %, while the main background events 68Ge
and 60Co, were 36.23 times and 31.45 times, respectively. The background
suppression effects of 232Th and 238U were 4.79 times and 5.06 times,
respectively. The results show that the strip multi-electrode high-purity

exploited as a powerful self-supervised pre-training technique. The existing
MIM methods adopt the strategy to mask random patches of the image and
reconstruct the missing pixels, which only considers semantic information at a
lower level, and causes a long pre-training time.This paper presents HybridMIM,
a novel hybrid self-supervised learning method based on masked image modeling
for 3D medical image segmentation.Specifically, we design a two-level masking
hierarchy to specify which and how patches in sub-volumes are masked,
effectively providing the constraints of higher level semantic information.
Then we learn the semantic information of medical images at three levels,
including:1) partial region prediction to reconstruct key contents of the 3D
image, which largely reduces the pre-training time burden (pixel-level); 2)
patch-masking perception to learn the spatial relationship between the patches
in each sub-volume (region-level).and 3) drop-out-based contrastive learning
between samples within a mini-batch, which further improves the generalization
ability of the framework (sample-level). The proposed framework is versatile to
support both CNN and transformer as encoder backbones, and also enables to
pre-train decoders for image segmentation. We conduct comprehensive experiments
on four widely-used public medical image segmentation datasets, including
BraTS2020, BTCV, MSD Liver, and MSD Spleen. The experimental results show the
clear superiority of HybridMIM against competing supervised methods, masked
pre-training approaches, and other self-supervised methods, in terms of
quantitative metrics, timing performance and qualitative observations. The

  well","Accepted to CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Extracting class activation maps (CAM) from a classification model often
results in poor coverage on foreground objects, i.e., only the discriminative
region (e.g., the ""head"" of ""sheep"") is recognized and the rest (e.g., the
""leg"" of ""sheep"") mistakenly as background. The crux behind is that the weight
of the classifier (used to compute CAM) captures only the discriminative
features of objects. We tackle this by introducing a new computation method for
CAM that explicitly captures non-discriminative features as well, thereby
expanding CAM to cover whole objects. Specifically, we omit the last pooling
layer of the classification model, and perform clustering on all local features
of an object class, where ""local"" means ""at a spatial pixel position"". We call
the resultant K cluster centers local prototypes - represent local semantics
like the ""head"", ""leg"", and ""body"" of ""sheep"". Given a new image of the class,
we compare its unpooled features to every prototype, derive K similarity
matrices, and then aggregate them into a heatmap (i.e., our CAM). Our CAM thus
captures all local features of the class without discrimination. We evaluate it
in the challenging tasks of weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), and
plug it in multiple state-of-the-art WSSS methods, such as MCTformer and AMN,
by simply replacing their original CAM with ours. Our extensive experiments on
standard WSSS benchmarks (PASCAL VOC and MS COCO) show the superiority of our
method: consistent improvements with little computational overhead.

Comments are welcome",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  We use $z=1$ mock galaxy catalogues produced with the semi-analytic code
GALACTICUS to study the dependence of the non-Gaussian bias parameter $b_\phi$
on the mass assembly history of the host halos. We generate large sets of
merger trees and measure the non-Gaussian assembly bias $\Delta b_\phi$ for
galaxies selected by color magnitude and emission line luminosities. For
galaxies selected by $g-r$ color, we find a large assembly bias consistent with
the analysis of Barreira et al. (2020) based on hydro-dynamical simulations of
galaxy formation. This effect arises from the fact that a larger value of the
normalization amplitude $\sigma_8$ implies a faster mass assembly (at fixed
halo mass) and, therefore, older and redder galaxies. On the contrary, for
galaxies selected by their H$\alpha$ luminosity, we do not detect a significant
assembly bias, at least at $z=1$ and in the halo mass range $3\times10^{10} < M
< 10^{12}\ M_\odot$ considered here. This is presumably due to the fact that
emission line strengths are mainly sensitive to the instantaneous star
formation rate, which appears to depend weakly on $\sigma_8$ at $z=1$. This
indicates that the non-Gaussian assembly bias should be less of a concern for
future emission line galaxy surveys. We also investigate, for the first time,
the sensitivity of the non-Gaussian assembly bias to a change in the parameters
of the galaxy formation model that control the AGN and stellar feedback as well
as the star formation rate. When these parameters change within a factor of two
from their fiducial value, they induce variations up to order unity in the
measured $\Delta b_\phi$, but the overall trends with color or luminosity
remain the same. However, since these results may be sensitive to the choice of
galaxy formation model, it will be prudent to extend this analysis to other
semi-analytic models in addition to halo mass and redshift.

neutron, quark, and Bose-Einstein Condensate stars in the conformally invariant
Weyl geometric gravity theory. The basic theory is derived from the simplest
conformally invariant action, constructed, in Weyl geometry, from the square of
the Weyl scalar, the strength of the Weyl vector, and a matter term,
respectively. The action is linearized in the Weyl scalar by introducing an
auxiliary scalar field. To keep the theory conformally invariant the trace
condition is imposed on the matter energy-momentum tensor. The field equations
are derived by varying the action with respect to the metric tensor, Weyl
vector field and scalar field. By adopting a static spherically symmetric
interior geometry, we obtain the field equations, describing the structure and
properties of stellar objects in Weyl geometric gravity. The solutions of the
field equations are obtained numerically, for different equations of state of
the neutron and quark matter. More specifically, constant density stellar
models, and models described by the stiff fluid, radiation fluid, quark bag
model, and Bose-Einstein Condensate equations of state are explicitly
constructed numerically in both general relativity and Weyl geometric gravity,
thus allowing an in depth comparison between the predictions of these two

than their general relativistic counterparts. As a possible astrophysical
application of the obtained results we suggest that the recently observed
neutron stars, with masses in the range of 2$M_{\odot}$ and 3$M_{\odot}$,

at augmenting the driving scenes on camera in the 3D space. We first utilize
Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to reconstruct the 3D models of background and

the 3D objects with adapted location and orientation at the pre-defined valid
region of backgrounds. As such, the training database could be effectively
scaled up. However, the 3D object modeling is constrained to the image quality
and the limited viewpoints. To overcome these problems, we modify the original
NeRF by introducing a geometric rectified loss and a symmetric-aware training

task on the Waymo and nuScences datasets. The proposed data augmentation
approach contributes to a gain of 1.7% and 1.4% in terms of detection accuracy,

  Prediction","10 pages, 11 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Predicting panoramic indoor lighting from a single perspective image is a
fundamental but highly ill-posed problem in computer vision and graphics. To
achieve locale-aware and robust prediction, this problem can be decomposed into
three sub-tasks: depth-based image warping, panorama inpainting and
high-dynamic-range (HDR) reconstruction, among which the success of panorama
inpainting plays a key role. Recent methods mostly rely on convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) to fill the missing contents in the warped panorama. However,
they usually achieve suboptimal performance since the missing contents occupy a
very large portion in the panoramic space while CNNs are plagued by limited
receptive fields. The spatially-varying distortion in the spherical signals
further increases the difficulty for conventional CNNs. To address these
issues, we propose a local-to-global strategy for large-scale panorama
inpainting. In our method, a depth-guided local inpainting is first applied on
the warped panorama to fill small but dense holes. Then, a transformer-based
network, dubbed PanoTransformer, is designed to hallucinate reasonable global
structures in the large holes. To avoid distortion, we further employ cubemap
projection in our design of PanoTransformer. The high-quality panorama
recovered at any locale helps us to capture spatially-varying indoor
illumination with physically-plausible global structures and fine details.

This is because the object coordinates induced by global and rigid alignment of
objects are semantically incoherent, making the coordinate regression hard to

(SOCS) built by warping-and-aligning the objects guided by a sparse set of
keypoints with semantically meaningful correspondence. SOCS is semantically
coherent: Any point on the surface of a object can be mapped to a semantically
meaningful location in SOCS, allowing for accurate pose and size estimation

mobile device. How to leverage the device-side samples to improve the
cloud-side large model becomes a practical requirement, but falls into the
dilemma of no raw sample up-link and no large model down-link. Specifically,
the user may opt out of sharing raw samples with the cloud due to the concern
of privacy or communication overhead, while the size of some large vision
models far exceeds the mobile device's runtime capacity. In this work, we
propose a device-cloud collaborative controlled learning framework, called
DC-CCL, enabling a cloud-side large vision model that cannot be directly
deployed on the mobile device to still benefit from the device-side local
samples. In particular, DC-CCL vertically splits the base model into two
submodels, one large submodel for learning from the cloud-side samples and the
other small submodel for learning from the device-side samples and performing
device-cloud knowledge fusion. Nevertheless, on-device training of the small
submodel requires the output of the cloud-side large submodel to compute the
desired gradients. DC-CCL thus introduces a light-weight model to mimic the
large cloud-side submodel with knowledge distillation, which can be offloaded
to the mobile device to control its small submodel's optimization direction.
Given the decoupling nature of two submodels in collaborative learning, DC-CCL
also allows the cloud to take a pre-trained model and the mobile device to take
another model with a different backbone architecture.

train models across multiple nodes (i.e., clients) holding local data sets,
without explicitly exchanging the data. It has attracted a growing interest in
recent years due to its advantages in terms of privacy considerations, and
communication resources. In FL, selected clients train their local models and
send a function of the models to the server, which consumes a random processing
and transmission time. The server updates the global model and broadcasts it
back to the clients. The client selection problem in FL is to schedule a subset
of the clients for training and transmission at each given time so as to
optimize the learning performance. In this paper, we present a novel
multi-armed bandit (MAB)-based approach for client selection to minimize the
training latency without harming the ability of the model to generalize, that
is, to provide reliable predictions for new observations. We develop a novel
algorithm to achieve this goal, dubbed Bandit Scheduling for FL (BSFL). We
analyze BSFL theoretically, and show that it achieves a logarithmic regret,
defined as the loss of BSFL as compared to a genie that has complete knowledge

theoretical framework considering the chemical activity for saturated porous

thermodynamics. First, to highlight the important role of porosity in the
hydro-mechanical-chemical multi-field coupling mechanism, the solid strain is
divided into the porosity-dependent skeleton strain, the matrix strain and the
mass-exchange strain. The stress and strain state variables are determined from
the energy-conjugated form of the energy balance equation for establishing
constitutive equations. Second, under infinitesimal case, general elastic
constitutive equations including the relationship between mass fraction and its
chemical potential are expressed by the free energy potential. Plastic model
and the constitutive equation of thermodynamic flux and force are derived from
the dissipative potential. Finally, under the guide of this theoretical
framework, the complete swelling constitutive models in the confined
compression are established for bentonite. The corresponding governing
equations are formulated for multi-field two-phase saturated porous media.
Compared with the experimental data, the proposed model can well reflect the

RGB source is converted to depth and static saliency sources, simultaneously.
In the moving object predictor, we propose the multi-source fusion structure.
First, the spatial importance of each source is highlighted with the help of
the interoceptive spatial attention module (ISAM). Second, the motion-enhanced
module (MEM) is designed to generate pure foreground motion attention for
improving both static and moving features used in the decoder. Furthermore, we
design a feature purification module (FPM) to filter the inter-source

effectively fused. In addition, we put forward an adaptive predictor fusion

prevent over-reliance on the failed results caused by low-quality optical flow

the occlusion as a remedy for perceptual deficiencies. This paper introduces a
novel social occlusion inference approach that learns a mapping from agent
trajectories and scene context to an occupancy grid map (OGM) representing the

existing prognosis techniques demonstrate potential results, they are highly
limited in terms of using a single modality. Most importantly, they fail in
considering a key element for prognosis: not all features extracted at the
current moment may contribute to the prognosis prediction several years later.
To address the current drawbacks of the literature, we propose a novel
hypergraph framework based on an information bottleneck strategy (HGIB).
Firstly, our framework seeks to discriminate irrelevant information, and
therefore, solely focus on harmonising relevant information for future MCI
conversion prediction e.g., two years later). Secondly, our model
simultaneously accounts for multi-modal data based on imaging and non-imaging
modalities. HGIB uses a hypergraph structure to represent the multi-modality
data and accounts for various data modality types. Thirdly, the key of our
model is based on a new optimisation scheme. It is based on modelling the
principle of information bottleneck into loss functions that can be integrated
into our hypergraph neural network. We demonstrate, through extensive
experiments on ADNI, that our proposed HGIB framework outperforms existing
state-of-the-art hypergraph neural networks for Alzheimer's disease prognosis.
We showcase our model even under fewer labels. Finally, we further support the
robustness and generalisation capabilities of our framework under both

solution for diverse applications, including cargo delivery and traffic
control. However, it is still challenging to communicate with and control the
UAV swarm with high reliability, low latency, and high energy efficiency. In
this paper, we propose a two-phase command and control (C&C) transmission
scheme in a cellular-connected UAV swarm network, where the ground base station
(GBS) broadcasts the common C&C message in Phase I. In Phase II, the UAVs that
have successfully decoded the C&C message will relay the message to the rest of
UAVs via device-to-device (D2D) communications in either broadcast or unicast
mode, under latency and energy constraints. To maximize the number of UAVs that
receive the message successfully within the latency and energy constraints, we
formulate the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process to find the
optimal policy. To address this problem, we propose a decentralized constrained
graph attention multi-agent Deep-Q-network (DCGA-MADQN) algorithm based on
Lagrangian primal-dual policy optimization, where a PID-controller algorithm is
utilized to update the Lagrange Multiplier. Simulation results show that our
algorithm could maximize the number of UAVs that successfully receive the

generating adversarial examples as model fingerprints. FedRight outperforms
previous works in four key aspects: (i) Validity: it extracts model features to
generate transferable fingerprints to train a detector to verify the copyright

training, thus promising good main task performance. (iii) Robustness: it is
empirically robust against malicious attacks on copyright protection, i.e.,
fine-tuning, model pruning, and adaptive attacks. (iv) Black-box: it is valid
in the black-box forensic scenario where only application programming interface

important step in reducing the progression of the disease. Therefore, many
methods have been introduced for this task based on deep learning. Among these
approaches, the methods based on ROIs are in a good position in terms of
accuracy and complexity. In these techniques, some specific parts of the brain
are extracted as ROI manually for all of the patients. Extracting ROI manually
is time-consuming and its results depend on human expertness and precision.
Method To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel smart method for
detecting ROIs automatically based on Explainable AI using Grad-Cam and a 3DCNN
model that extracts ROIs per patient. After extracting the ROIs automatically,
Alzheimer's disease is predicted using extracted ROI-based 3D CNN. Results We
implement our method on 176 MCI patients of the famous ADNI dataset and obtain
remarkable results compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The accuracy
acquired using 5-fold cross-validation is 98.6 and the AUC is 1. We also
compare the results of the ROI-based method with the whole brain-based method.
The results show that the performance is impressively increased. Conclusion The
experimental results show that the proposed smart ROI extraction, which
extracts the ROIs automatically, performs well for Alzheimer's disease
prediction. The proposed method can also be used for Alzheimer's disease
classification and diagnosis.

slowly making their way into the space weather modeling toolchains to replace
the semi-empirical methods such as the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model. However,
since they are based on CFD, if the assumptions in them are too strong, these
codes might experience issues with convergence and unphysical solutions.
Particularly the magnetograms corresponding to solar maxima can pose problems
as they contain active regions with strong magnetic fields, resulting in large
gradients. Combined with the approximate way in which the inner boundary is
often treated, this can lead to non-physical features or even a complete
divergence of the simulation in these cases. Here, we show some of the possible
approaches to handle this inner boundary in our global coronal model COolfluid
COrona uNstrUcTured (COCONUT) in a way that improves both convergence and
accuracy. Since we know that prescribing the photospheric magnetic field for a
region that represents the lower corona is not entirely physical, first, we
look at the ways in which we can adjust the input magnetograms to remove the
highest magnitudes and gradients. Secondly, since in the default setup we also
assume a constant density, here we experiment with changing these values
locally and globally to see the effect on the results. We conclude, through
comparison with observations and convergence analysis, that modifying the
density locally in active regions is the best way to improve the performance
both in terms of convergence and physical accuracy from the tested approaches.

  Flipping Games as a Demonstration Case",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY q-fin.MF","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The takeoff point for this paper is the voluminous body of literature
addressing recursive betting games with expected logarithmic growth of wealth
being the performance criterion. Whereas almost all existing papers involve use
of linear feedback, the use of nonlinear control is conspicuously absent. This
is epitomized by the large subset of this literature dealing with Kelly
Betting. With this as the high-level motivation, we study the potential for use
of nonlinear control in this framework. To this end, we consider a
``demonstration case'' which is one of the simplest scenarios encountered in
this line of research: repeated flips of a biased coin with probability of
heads~$p$, and even-money payoff on each flip. First, we formulate a new robust
nonlinear control problem which we believe is both simple to understand and
apropos for dealing with concerns about distributional robustness; i.e.,
instead of assuming that~$p$ is perfectly known as in the case of the classical
Kelly formulation, we begin with a bounding set ~${\cal P} \subseteq [0,1]$ for
this probability. Then, we provide a theorem, our main result, which gives a
closed-form description of the optimal robust nonlinear controller and a
corollary which establishes that it robustly outperforms linear controllers
such as those found in the literature. A second, less significant, contribution
of this paper bears upon the computability of our solution. For an $n$-flip
game, whereas an admissible controller has~$2^n-1$ parameters, at the optimum
only~$O(n^2)$ of them turn out to be distinct. Finally, it is noted that the
initial assumptions on payoffs and the use of the uniform distribution on~$p$
are made solely for simplicity of the exposition and compliance with length
requirements for a Letter. Accordingly, the paper also includes a new section
with a discussion indicating how these assumptions can be relaxed.

significantly affects disk evolution by changing the coupling between the gas

physical quantities (e.g., density and magnetic field) of the disk are well
described by nontrivial power laws, regardless of the details of the dust
model. In this disk structure, the radial profile of density is steeper and the
disk mass is smaller than those of the model ignoring dust growth and they are
more consistent with the disk observations. We analytically derive these power
laws from the basic equations of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. The analytical
power laws are determined only by observable physical quantities, e.g., central
stellar mass and mass accretion rate, and do not include difficult-to-determine

various stages of disk evolution. We believe that the disk structure provides a

performance and robustness of different models for each task under zero-shot

ability of GPT series models on NLU tasks does not increase gradually as the
models evolve, especially with the introduction of the RLHF training strategy.

An unexplored challenge for FSOD is that instances from unlabeled novel classes

background. These objects behave similarly to label noise, leading to FSOD
performance degradation. We develop a semi-supervised algorithm to detect and
then utilize these unlabeled novel objects as positive samples during training

unlabeled novel objects and assign them new objectness labels. Our improved

have shown strong ability in sequential data modeling. To achieve high
performance, they usually rely on redundant or unexplainable structures to

large-scale data. Many real-world data mining tasks, however, lack sufficient
variables for relation reasoning, and therefore these methods may not properly
handle such forecasting problems. With insufficient data, time series appear to

develop a novel algorithmic framework for inferring the intrinsic latent

form multiple independent and predictable signal components that enable not
only sparse relation reasoning for long-term efficiency but also reconstructing
the future temporal data for accurate prediction. To achieve this, we introduce

where the model needs to retrieve/generate a likely textual hypothesis from a
visual input (image or part of an image) using backward reasoning based on
prior knowledge or commonsense. Unlike in conventional VL retrieval or
captioning tasks, where entities of texts appear in the image, in abductive
inferences, the relevant facts about inferences are not directly visible in the
input images. Besides, the inferences are causally relevant to regional visual
hints and vary with the latter. Existing works highlight visual parts from a
global background with specific prompt tuning techniques (e.g., colorful prompt
tuning) on top of foundation models, like CLIP. However, these methods
uniformly patchify ""regional hints"" and ""global context"" at the same
granularity level and may lose fine-grained visual details significant for
abductive reasoning.

patchify local hints to get fine-grained regional prompts. These prompts are

method for fast and effective correction of susceptibility artifacts in
reversed phase-encode (PE) image pairs acquired with EPI. FD-Net predicts both
the susceptibility-induced displacement field and the underlying
anatomically-correct image. Unlike previous methods, FD-Net enforces the
forward-distortions of the correct image in both PE directions to be consistent
with the acquired reversed-PE image pair. FD-Net further leverages a
multiresolution architecture to maintain high local and global performance.
FD-Net performs competitively with a gold-standard reference method (TOPUP) in
image quality, while enabling a leap in computational efficiency. Furthermore,

localize objects with only image-level supervision. Recent works apply visual
transformer to WSOL and achieve significant success by exploiting the
long-range feature dependency in self-attention mechanism. However, existing
transformer-based methods synthesize the classification feature maps as the
localization map, which leads to optimization conflicts between classification
and localization tasks. To address this problem, we propose to learn a
task-specific spatial-aware token (SAT) to condition localization in a weakly
supervised manner. Specifically, a spatial token is first introduced in the
input space to aggregate representations for localization task. Then a spatial
aware attention module is constructed, which allows spatial token to generate
foreground probabilities of different patches by querying and to extract
localization knowledge from the classification task. Besides, for the problem
of sparse and unbalanced pixel-level supervision obtained from the image-level
label, two spatial constraints, including batch area loss and normalization
loss, are designed to compensate and enhance this supervision. Experiments show
that the proposed SAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CUB-200 and
ImageNet, with 98.45% and 73.13% GT-known Loc, respectively. Even under the
extreme setting of using only 1 image per class from ImageNet for training, SAT
already exceeds the SOTA method by 2.1% GT-known Loc. Code and models are

recent advances in solving inverse graphics problems, such as the
reconstruction of 3D scenes from 2D images. By making the rendering process
differentiable, one can compute gradients of the output image with respect to
the different scene parameters efficiently using automatic differentiation.
Interested in the potential of such methods for the analysis of fluorescence
microscopy images, we introduce deltaMic, a microscopy renderer that can
generate a 3D fluorescence microscopy image from a 3D scene in a fully
differentiable manner. By convolving the meshes in the scene with the point
spread function (PSF) of the microscope, that characterizes the response of its
imaging system to a point source, we emulate the 3D image creation process of
fluorescence microscopy. This is achieved by computing the Fourier transform
(FT) of the mesh and performing the convolution in the Fourier domain. Naive
implementation of such mesh FT is however slow, inefficient, and sensitive to
numerical precision. We solve these difficulties by providing a memory and
computationally efficient fully differentiable GPU implementation of the 3D
mesh FT. We demonstrate the potential of our method by reconstructing complex
shapes from artificial microscopy images. Eventually, we apply our renderer to
real confocal fluorescence microscopy images of embryos to accurately
reconstruct the multicellular shapes of these cell aggregates.

good usability and least confusion. To facilitate VAHF gesture recognition, we
proposed a novel cross-device sensing method that leverages heterogeneous

critical to ensure the responsible use of LLMs. Recent works attempt to tackle
this problem either using certain model signatures present in the generated

that these detectors are not reliable in practical scenarios. Empirically, we
show that paraphrasing attacks, where a light paraphraser is applied on top of

we show that even LLMs protected by watermarking schemes can be vulnerable
against spoofing attacks where adversarial humans can infer hidden watermarking

the current state of research on using LLMs to automate and support educational
tasks. The practical and ethical challenges of LLMs-based innovations were also
identified by assessing their technological readiness, model performance,
replicability, system transparency, privacy, equality, and beneficence. The
findings were summarised into three recommendations for future studies,
including updating existing innovations with state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
GPT-3), embracing the initiative of open-sourcing models/systems, and adopting
a human-centred approach throughout the developmental process. These
recommendations could support future research to develop practical and ethical
innovations for supporting diverse educational tasks and benefiting students,
teachers, and institutions.

learning can be harnessed to increase sustainability in production and product
usage. Specifically, we utilize deep learning-based computer vision to
determine the wear states of products. The resulting insights serve as a basis
for novel product-service systems with improved integration and result
orientation. Moreover, these insights are expected to facilitate product usage
improvements and R&D innovations. We demonstrate our approach on two products:
machining tools and rotating X-ray anodes. From a technical standpoint, we show
that it is possible to recognize the wear state of these products using
deep-learning-based computer vision. In particular, we detect wear through
microscopic images of the two products. We utilize a U-Net for semantic
segmentation to detect wear based on pixel granularity. The resulting mean dice
coefficients of 0.631 and 0.603 demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
approach. Consequently, experts can now make better decisions, for example, to
improve the machining process parameters. To assess the impact of the proposed
approach on environmental sustainability, we perform life cycle assessments
that show gains for both products. The results indicate that the emissions of
CO2 equivalents are reduced by 12% for machining tools and by 44% for rotating
anodes. This work can serve as a guideline and inspire researchers and
practitioners to utilize computer vision in similar scenarios to develop
sustainable smart product-service systems and enable cleaner production.

We are concerned with two types of metacognitive skills: strategy-awareness and
time-awareness, that is, which problem-solving strategy to use and when to use
it. Our data were collected from 495 participants across three consecutive
semesters, and our results show that the only students who consistently
outperform their peers across both domains are those who are not only highly
motivated but also strategy-aware and time-aware.

into three layers: a foundational ontology layer, a domain ontology layer and a
linguistic layer. The domain ontology layer contains language-independent math
concepts. The linguistic layer provides linguistic grounding for these
concepts, and the foundation ontology layer provides them with meta-ontological

is the sharp boundary between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds? It was
this ""interpretation problem"" that prompted Schr\""odinger to propose his famous
thought experiment (a cat that is simultaneously both dead and alive) and
sparked a great debate about the quantum measurement problem, and there is
still no satisfactory answer yet. This is precisely the inadequacy of rigorous
mathematical models in describing the laws of nature. We propose a
computational model to describe and understand the laws of nature based on
Darwin's natural selection. In fact, whether it's a macro particle, a micro
electron or a security, they can all be considered as an entity, the change of
this entity over time can be described by a data series composed of states and
values. An observer can learn from this data series to construct theories
(usually consisting of functions and differential equations). We don't model
with the usual functions or differential equations, but with a state Decision
Tree (determines the state of an entity) and a value Function Tree (determines
the distance between two points of an entity). A state Decision Tree and a
value Function Tree together can reconstruct an entity's trajectory and make
predictions about its future trajectory. Our proposed algorithmic model
discovers laws of nature by only learning observed historical data (sequential
measurement of observables) based on maximizing the observer's expected value.
There is no differential equation in our model; our model has an emphasis on
machine learning, where the observer builds up his/her experience by being
rewarded or punished for each decision he/she makes, and eventually leads to
rediscovering Newton's law, the Born rule (quantum mechanics) and the efficient
market hypothesis (financial market).

commercial banks in Bangladesh using panel data from 28 banks over the period
of 2013-2019. Three analytical methods, including the Fixed Effect model,
Random Effect model, and Pooled Ordinary Least Square (POLS) method, are
employed to analyze two versions of the capital adequacy ratio, namely the
Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) and Tier 1 Capital Ratio. The study reveals that
capital adequacy is significantly affected by several independent variables,
with leverage and liquidity risk having a negative and positive relationship,
respectively. Additionally, the study finds a positive correlation between real
GDP and net profit and capital adequacy, while inflation has a negative
correlation. For the Tier 1 Ratio, the study shows no significant relationship
betweenleverage and liquidity risk, but a positive correlation with the number
of employees, net profit, and real GDP, while a negative correlation with size
and GDP deflator. Pooled OLS analysis reveals a negative correlation with
leverage, size, and inflation for both CAR and Tier 1 Capital Ratio, and a
positive correlation with liquidity risk, net profit, and real GDP. Based on
the Hausman test, the Random Effect model is deemed moresuitable for this
dataset. These findings have important implications for policymakers,
investors, and bank managers in Bangladesh by providing insights into the
factors that impact the capital ratios of commercial banks.

very simple, single-user workloads on small data sets. This paper presents
KERMIT - the autonomic architecture for big data capable of automatically

faster than rule-of-thumb tuning by a human administrator and up to 92% as fast
as the fastest possible tuning established by performing an exhaustive search

with up to 99% accuracy, and predict future workload types with up to 96%
accuracy. It is capable of identifying and classifying complex multi-user
workloads without being explicitly trained on examples of these workloads. It
does not rely on the past workload history to predict the future workload
classes and their associated performance. KERMIT can identify and learn new

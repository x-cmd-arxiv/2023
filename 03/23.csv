gravity. We resort to mock catalogs of standard siren (SS) events to see
whether data from future gravitational wave (GWs) observatories will be able to
distinguish these models from $\Lambda$CDM.
  The first model is the most general $f(Q)$ formulation that replicates a
$\Lambda$CDM background, with deviations appearing only at the perturbative
level. It has one additional free parameter compared to $\Lambda$CDM, $\alpha$,
which when set to zero falls back to $\Lambda$CDM. We show that LIGO-Virgo is
unable to constrain $\alpha$, due to the high error and low redshift of the
measurements, whereas LISA and the ET will, with the ET outperforming LISA. The
catalogs for both LISA and LIGO-Virgo show non-negligible statistical
fluctuations, where we consider three representative catalogs (the best, median
and worst), whereas for the ET, only a single catalog is considered, as the
number of events is large enough for statistical fluctuations to be neglected.
The best LISA catalog is the one with more low redshift events, while the worst
LISA catalog features fewer low redshift events. Additionally, if we are to
observe a bad LISA catalog, we can rely on data from LIGO-Virgo to improve the
quality of the constrains, bringing it closer to a median LISA catalog.
  The second model attempts to replace dark energy by making use of a specific
form of the function $f(Q)$. We study this model resorting to dynamical system
techniques to show the regions in parameter space with viable cosmologies.
Using model selection criteria, we show that no number of SS events is, by
itself, able to tell this model and $\Lambda$CDM apart. We then show that if we
add current type Ia Supernova (SnIa) data, tensions in this model arise when
compared to the constrains set by the SS events.

printing industry. Developing algorithms capable of automatically synthesizing
vector fonts can significantly facilitate the font design process. However,
existing methods mainly concentrate on raster image generation, and only a few
approaches can directly synthesize vector fonts. This paper proposes an
end-to-end trainable method, VecFontSDF, to reconstruct and synthesize
high-quality vector fonts using signed distance functions (SDFs). Specifically,
based on the proposed SDF-based implicit shape representation, VecFontSDF
learns to model each glyph as shape primitives enclosed by several parabolic
curves, which can be precisely converted to quadratic B\'ezier curves that are
widely used in vector font products. In this manner, most image generation
methods can be easily extended to synthesize vector fonts. Qualitative and
quantitative experiments conducted on a publicly-available dataset demonstrate
that our method obtains high-quality results on several tasks, including vector
font reconstruction, interpolation, and few-shot vector font synthesis,
markedly outperforming the state of the art.

  Regression",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Dynamic networks have been increasingly used to characterize brain
connectivity that varies during resting and task states. In such
characterizations, a connectivity network is typically measured at each time
point for a subject over a common set of nodes representing brain regions,
together with rich subject-level information. A common approach to analyzing
such data is an edge-based method that models the connectivity between each
pair of nodes separately. However, such approach may have limited performance
when the noise level is high and the number of subjects is limited, as it does
not take advantage of the inherent network structure. To better understand if
and how the subject-level covariates affect the dynamic brain connectivity, we
introduce a semi-parametric dynamic network response regression that relates a
dynamic brain connectivity network to a vector of subject-level covariates. A
key advantage of our method is to exploit the structure of dynamic imaging
coefficients in the form of high-order tensors. We develop an efficient
estimation algorithm and evaluate the efficacy of our approach through
simulation studies. Finally, we present our results on the analysis of a

  on the behavior of adaptive design optimization","Submitted for journal publication",,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adaptive design optimization (ADO) is a state-of-the-art technique for
experimental design (Cavagnaro, Myung, Pitt, & Kujala, 2010). ADO dynamically
identifies stimuli that, in expectation, yield the most information about a
hypothetical construct of interest (e.g., parameters of a cognitive model). To
calculate this expectation, ADO leverages the modeler's existing knowledge,
specified in the form of a prior distribution. Informative priors align with
the distribution of the focal construct in the participant population. This
alignment is assumed by ADO's internal assessment of expected information gain.
If the prior is instead misinformative, i.e., does not align with the
participant population, ADO's estimates of expected information gain could be
inaccurate. In many cases, the true distribution that characterizes the
participant population is unknown, and experimenters rely on heuristics in
their choice of prior and without an understanding of how this choice affects
ADO's behavior.
  Our work introduces a mathematical framework that facilitates investigation
of the consequences of the choice of prior distribution on the efficiency of
experiments designed using ADO. Through theoretical and empirical results, we
show that, in the context of prior misinformation, measures of expected
information gain are distinct from the correctness of the corresponding
inference. Through a series of simulation experiments, we show that, in the
case of parameter estimation, ADO nevertheless outperforms other design
methods. Conversely, in the case of model selection, misinformative priors can
lead inference to favor the wrong model, and rather than mitigating this
pitfall, ADO exacerbates it.

to classify point-like sources in miniJPAS, which were observed in 60 optical
bands over $\sim$ 1 deg$^2$ in the AEGIS field. We developed two algorithms
based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to classify objects into four
categories: stars, galaxies, quasars at low redshift ($z < 2.1)$, and quasars
at high redshift ($z \geq 2.1$). As inputs, we used miniJPAS fluxes for one of
the classifiers (ANN$_1$) and colours for the other (ANN$_2$). The ANNs were
trained and tested using mock data in the first place. We studied the effect of
augmenting the training set by creating hybrid objects, which combines fluxes
from stars, galaxies, and quasars. Nevertheless, the augmentation processing
did not improve the score of the ANN. We also evaluated the performance of the
classifiers in a small subset of the SDSS DR12Q superset observed by miniJPAS.
In the mock test set, the f1-score for quasars at high redshift with the
ANN$_1$ (ANN$_2$) are $0.99$ ($0.99$), $0.93$ ($0.92$), and $0.63$ ($0.57$) for
$17 < r \leq 20$, $20 < r \leq 22.5$, and $22.5 < r \leq 23.6$, respectively,

galaxies, including the nearby (D=3.5 Mpc) starburst galaxy NGC 253. The
simultaneous detection of these two species in regions where the star formation
rate is high may be used to study the shock history of the gas. We perform a
multi-line molecular study using these two shock tracers (SiO and HNCO) with
the aim of characterizing the gas properties. We also explore the possibility
of reconstructing the shock history in NGC 253's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ).
Six SiO transitions and eleven HNCO transitions were imaged at high resolution
$1''.6$ (28 pc) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) as
part of the ALCHEMI Large Programme. Both non-LTE radiative transfer analysis
and chemical modelling were performed in order to characterize the gas
properties, and to investigate the chemical origin of the emission. The non-LTE
radiative transfer analysis coupled with Bayesian inference shows clear
evidence that the gas traced by SiO has different densities and temperatures
than that traced by HNCO, with an indication that shocks are needed to produce
both species. Chemical modelling further confirms such a scenario and suggests
that fast and slow shocks are responsible for SiO and HNCO production,
respectively, in most GMCs. We are also able to infer the physical
characteristics of the shocks traced by SiO and HNCO for each GMC. Radiative
transfer and chemical analysis of the SiO and HNCO in the CMZ of NGC 253 reveal
a complex picture whereby most of the GMCs are subjected to shocks. We
speculate on the possible shock scenarios responsible for the observed emission
and provide potential history and timescales for each shock scenario. Higher
spatial resolution observations of these two species are required in order to
quantitatively differentiate between scenarios.

the whole remnant was observed in X-rays with homogeneous sensitivity. Vela Jr
is one of the few remnants emitting in the TeV band, making it an important
object in shock acceleration studies. However, the age and distance
determination using X-ray emission is largely hampered by the presence of the
Vela SNR along the same line. With the eROSITA data set our aim is to
characterize the emission of Vela Jr and distinguish it from Vela emission, and
also to characterize the spectral emission of the inner remnant. We processed
the eROSITA data dividing the whole remnant into seven different regions. In
addition, images of the whole remnant were employed to pinpoint the position of
the geometric center and constrain the proper motion of the CCO. We also
employed archival XMM-Newton pointed observations of the NW rim to determine
the cutoff energy of the electrons and the expansion velocity. We find the
magnetic field can vary between 2 $\mu$G and 16 $\mu$G in the NW rim. We also
find that the remnant spectrum is uniformly featureless in most regions, except
for two inner regions where an extra thermal model component improves the fit.
We obtain new coordinates for the geometric remnant center, resulting in a
separation of only 35.2 $\pm$ 15.8"" from the position of the CCO. As a result,
we reinforce the association between the CCO and a proposed faint optical/IR

concept about which I remain skeptical, deep closed-loop heat exchangers. These
designs are sometimes called Advanced Geothermal Systems, AGS. To clarify, this
blog post discusses the use of closed-loop heat exchangers in deep geothermal
wells, 1000s of ft deep. This is a different application than the use of
closed-loop heat exchangers in very shallow wells, 10s of ft deep, for ground
source heat pumps. The fundamental challenge is that closed-loop heat exchanger
designs rely on conduction, and sometimes free convection, to bring energy into
the well. These processes are inherently much slower than forced convection,
which is what drives energy transport into a conventional geothermal well.
Slower energy transport means less revenue, and therefore, worse economics. In
the past few years, there have been many creative new ideas for using
closed-loop heat exchangers for geothermal energy production. Usually, these
proposals recognize the challenge facing closed-loop, but introduce a wrinkle
intended to overcome the problem. Despite these efforts, there are still
daunting technical hurdles to widespread deployment of deep closed-loop

the heavy quark case, thanks to heavy flavor tagging. In that case, the
dominant background is expected to come from the eikonal production of a
quark-antiquark-gluon system. We propose experimental cuts to suppress that
background contribution, making the process of quark-gluon dijet production in
Deep Inelastic Scattering a new method to probe the quark transverse momentum

layer (TL) with higher security and privacy is used to decouple the above
problem into two tasks: defense protocols against DoS attacks on TL and defense
protocols against actuation attacks on cyber-physical layer (CPL). First,
considering modeling errors of leader dynamics, we introduce distributed
observers to reconstruct the leader dynamics for each follower on TL under DoS
attacks. Second, distributed estimators are used to estimate follower states
according to the reconstructed leader dynamics on the TL. Third, according to
the reconstructed leader dynamics, we design decentralized solvers that
calculate the output regulator equations on CPL. Fourth, decentralized adaptive
attack-resilient control schemes that resist unbounded actuation attacks are
provided on CPL. Furthermore, we apply the above control protocols to prove
that the followers can achieve uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) convergence,
and the upper bound of the UUB convergence is determined explicitly. Finally,
two simulation examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed

State-of-the-art approaches use a dynamic architecture based on network
expansion (NE), in which a task expert is added per task. While effective from
a computational standpoint, these methods lead to models that grow quickly with
the number of tasks. A new NE method, dense network expansion (DNE), is
proposed to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and model complexity.
This is accomplished by the introduction of dense connections between the
intermediate layers of the task expert networks, that enable the transfer of
knowledge from old to new tasks via feature sharing and reusing. This sharing
is implemented with a cross-task attention mechanism, based on a new task
attention block (TAB), that fuses information across tasks. Unlike traditional
attention mechanisms, TAB operates at the level of the feature mixing and is
decoupled with spatial attentions. This is shown more effective than a joint
spatial-and-task attention for CIL. The proposed DNE approach can strictly
maintain the feature space of old classes while growing the network and feature
scale at a much slower rate than previous methods. In result, it outperforms
the previous SOTA methods by a margin of 4\% in terms of accuracy, with similar

acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs), which describe ancestral relations
between variables using directed and bidirected edges. However, existing
methods using ADMGs are based on either linear functional assumptions or a
discrete search that is complicated to use and lacks computational tractability
for large datasets. In this work, we further extend the existing body of work
and develop a novel gradient-based approach to learning an ADMG with non-linear
functional relations from observational data. We first show that the presence
of latent confounding is identifiable under the assumptions of bow-free ADMGs
with non-linear additive noise models. With this insight, we propose a novel
neural causal model based on autoregressive flows for ADMG learning. This not
only enables us to determine complex causal structural relationships behind the
data in the presence of latent confounding, but also estimate their functional
relationships (hence treatment effects) simultaneously. We further validate our
approach via experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and
demonstrate the competitive performance against relevant baselines.

papers pointed out, explanations are intuitive, and more empirical data is
needed to support hypotheses. In this paper, the authors analyze outage data
collected from various public sources to calculate the outage energy and outage
duration exponents of possible power-law fits. Temporal thresholds are applied
to identify crossovers from initial short-time behavior to power-law tails. We
revisit and add to the possible explanations of the uniformness of these
exponents. By performing power spectral analyses on the outage event time
series and the outage duration time series, it is found that, on the one hand,
while being overwhelmed by white noise, outage events show traits of
self-organized criticality (SOC), which may be modeled by a crossover from
random percolation to directed percolation branching process with dissipation.
On the other hand, in responses to outages, the heavy tails in outage duration
distributions could be a consequence of the highly optimized tolerance (HOT)

  and bosonic Gaussian systems","23 pages, 17 figures",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As previously demonstrated, the entropy production -- a key quantity
characterizing the irreversibility of thermodynamic processes -- is related to
generation of correlations between degrees of freedom of the system and its
thermal environment. This raises the question of whether such correlations are
of a classical or quantum nature, namely, whether they are accessible through
local measurements on the correlated degrees of freedom. We address this
problem by considering fermionic and bosonic Gaussian systems. We show that for
fermions the entropy production is mostly quantum due to the parity
superselection rule which restricts the set of physically allowed measurements
to projections on the Fock states, thus significantly limiting the amount of
classically accessible correlations. In contrast, in bosonic systems a much
larger amount of correlations can be accessed through Gaussian measurements.
Specifically, while the quantum contribution may be important at low
temperatures, in the high temperature limit the entropy production corresponds
to purely classical position-momentum correlations. Our results demonstrate an
important difference between fermionic and bosonic systems regarding the
existence of a quantum-to-classical transition in the microscopic formulation
of the entropy production. They also show that entropy production can be mainly
caused by quantum correlations even in the weak coupling limit, which admits a
description in terms of classical rate equations for state populations, as well
as in the low particle density limit, where the transport properties of both
bosons and fermions converge to those of classical particles.

However, it is often costly and difficult to accurately and efficiently
annotate large-scale datasets, especially for some specialized domains where
fine-grained labels are required. In this setting, coarse labels are much
easier to acquire as they do not require expert knowledge. In this work, we
propose a contrastive learning method, called $\textbf{Mask}$ed
$\textbf{Con}$trastive learning~($\textbf{MaskCon}$) to address the
under-explored problem setting, where we learn with a coarse-labelled dataset
in order to address a finer labelling problem. More specifically, within the
contrastive learning framework, for each sample our method generates
soft-labels with the aid of coarse labels against other samples and another
augmented view of the sample in question. By contrast to self-supervised
contrastive learning where only the sample's augmentations are considered hard
positives, and in supervised contrastive learning where only samples with the
same coarse labels are considered hard positives, we propose soft labels based
on sample distances, that are masked by the coarse labels. This allows us to
utilize both inter-sample relations and coarse labels. We demonstrate that our
method can obtain as special cases many existing state-of-the-art works and
that it provides tighter bounds on the generalization error. Experimentally,

popular parenting subreddits (r/Daddit, r/Mommit, and r/Parenting), which cater
to self-identified fathers and mothers (ostensibly single-gender) and parents

detection in English over the past several years, and there's been a noticeable
improvement and yet sarcasm detection in the Bangla language's state remains
the same. In this article, we present a BERT-based system that can achieve
99.60\% while the utilized traditional machine learning algorithms are only
capable of achieving 89.93\%. Additionally, we have employed Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations that introduce explainability to our

BanglaSarc that was constructed specifically for the evaluation of this study.
This dataset consists of fresh records of sarcastic and non-sarcastic comments,
the majority of which are acquired from Facebook and YouTube comment sections.

towards the goal of Explainable AI, especially nowadays where expressive
database query languages such as Datalog play a critical role in the
development of ontology-based applications. A standard way of explaining a
query result is the so-called why-provenance, which essentially provides
information about the witnesses to a query result in the form of subsets of the
input database that are sufficient to derive that result. To our surprise,
despite the fact that the notion of why-provenance for Datalog queries has been
around for decades and intensively studied, its computational complexity
remains unexplored. The goal of this work is to fill this apparent gap in the
why-provenance literature. Towards this end, we pinpoint the data complexity of
why-provenance for Datalog queries and key subclasses thereof. The takeaway of
our work is that why-provenance for recursive queries, even if the recursion is
limited to be linear, is an intractable problem, whereas for non-recursive
queries is highly tractable. Having said that, we experimentally confirm, by
exploiting SAT solvers, that making why-provenance for (recursive) Datalog
queries work in practice is not an unrealistic goal.

accomplished by estimating a crowd-density map and summing over the density

loss of density due to the use of broad Gaussian kernels to create the ground
truth density maps. This issue can be overcome by narrowing the Gaussian
kernel. However, existing approaches perform poorly when trained with such
ground truth density maps. To overcome this limitation, we propose using
conditional diffusion models to predict density maps, as diffusion models are
known to model complex distributions well and show high fidelity to training

steps of the diffusion process are noisy, we incorporate a regression branch
for direct crowd estimation only during training to improve the feature
learning. In addition, owing to the stochastic nature of the diffusion model,
we introduce producing multiple density maps to improve the counting
performance contrary to the existing crowd counting pipelines. Further, we also
differ from the density summation and introduce contour detection followed by
summation as the counting operation, which is more immune to background noise.
We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets to validate the

SHERF extracts and encodes 3D human representations in canonical space,
enabling rendering and animation from free views and poses. To achieve
high-fidelity novel view and pose synthesis, the encoded 3D human
representations should capture both global appearance and local fine-grained

sign language understanding. Sign language retrieval consists of two sub-tasks:
text-to-sign-video (T2V) retrieval and sign-video-to-text (V2T) retrieval.
Different from traditional video-text retrieval, sign language videos, not only
contain visual signals but also carry abundant semantic meanings by themselves
due to the fact that sign languages are also natural languages. Considering
this character, we formulate sign language retrieval as a cross-lingual
retrieval problem as well as a video-text retrieval task. Concretely, we take
into account the linguistic properties of both sign languages and natural
languages, and simultaneously identify the fine-grained cross-lingual (i.e.,
sign-to-word) mappings while contrasting the texts and the sign videos in a
joint embedding space. This process is termed as cross-lingual contrastive
learning. Another challenge is raised by the data scarcity issue-sign language
datasets are orders of magnitude smaller in scale than that of speech
recognition. We alleviate this issue by adopting a domain-agnostic sign encoder
pre-trained on large-scale sign videos into the target domain via
pseudo-labeling. Our framework, termed as domain-aware sign language retrieval
via Cross-lingual Contrastive learning or CiCo for short, outperforms the
pioneering method by large margins on various datasets, e.g., +22.4 T2V and
+28.0 V2T R@1 improvements on How2Sign dataset, and +13.7 T2V and +17.1 V2T R@1

into two parts: One is distributed estimation against DoS attacks on the TL and
the other is resilient decentralized tracking control against actuation attacks

The formation of such a binary is more efficient when the SMBHs are embedded in
a nuclear star cluster (NSC). NSCs are dense and massive stellar clusters
present in the majority of the observed galaxies. Their central densities can
reach up to $10^7\,M_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$ and their masses can be as large as a

SMBHB. Our models show that the merger can imprint signatures on the shape,
density profile, rotation and velocity structure of the NSC. The strength of
the signatures depends on the mass ratio between the SMBHs and on the orbital
initial conditions of the merger. In addition, the number of hypervelocity
stars produced in the mergers is linked to the SMBHB properties. The merger can
also contribute to the formation of the nuclear stellar disc of the galaxy.

formation, the formation channel of the Milky Way's NSC is still uncertain. In
this work, we use GigaEris, a very high resolution $N$-body hydrodynamical
cosmological ``zoom-in'' simulation, to investigate NSC formation in the
progenitor of a Milky Way-sized galaxy, as well as its relation to the assembly
and evolution of the galactic nuclear region. We study the possibility that

driven by the functional forms tested, given that it probes beyond our

exploring the evolution of binary stars during the early evolutionary phases of
ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFD). In our simulations, we assume that the
stellar component of the UFD is initially dynamically cold and evolves towards
its final equilibrium after undergoing the violent relaxation phase. We show
that the early evolutionary phases of the UFD significantly enhance the
disruption of wide binaries and leave their dynamical fingerprints on the
semi-major axis distribution of the surviving binaries as compared to models
initially in equilibrium. An initially thermal eccentricity distribution is
preserved except for the widest binaries for which it evolves towards a
superthermal distribution; for a binary population with an initially uniform
eccentricity distribution, memory of this initial distribution is rapidly lost
for most binaries as wider binaries evolve to approach a thermal/superthermal
distribution. The evolution of binaries is driven both by tidal effects due to
the potential of the UFD dark matter halo and collisional effects associated to
binary-binary/single star encounters. Collisional effects are particularly
important within the clumpy substructure characterizing the system during its
early evolution; in addition to enhancing binary ionization and evolution of
the binary orbital parameters, encounters may lead to exchanges of either of
the primordial binary components with one of the interacting stars.

galaxy, any high-z galaxy with a spatially non-homogeneous SED will experience
a spatially varying relative dimming or brightening in addition to the pure
distance effect. The morphology of galaxies will therefore change with z. For
instance, an early spiral galaxy observed in the V band would show a prominent
bulge at z=0, whereas, if at z=1, the V filter probes the rest-frame near-UV
where the bulge is faint and the disk relatively brighter, thus the galaxy may
appear as bulgeless. For galaxies with strong nebular emission, an additional
effect is that the shifting of strong nebular features in or out of filters
will result in a non-monotonous color evolution with z. Hence, unlike the
effects of distance, cosmological surface brightness dimming, and gravitational
lensing, which are all achromatic, the fact that most galaxies have a spatially
varying SED leads to a chromatic surface brightness modulation (CMOD) with z.
While the CMOD effects are in principle easy to grasp, they affect the
characterization of galaxies in a complex fashion. Properties such as the
bulge-to-disk ratio, Sersic exponent, effective radius, radial color gradients,
and stellar mass determinations from SED fitting will depend on z, the filters
employed, and the rest-frame 2D SED patterns in a galaxy, and will bias results
inferred on galaxy evolution across cosmic time (e.g., the evolution of the
mass-size, bulge-SMBH, and Tully-Fisher relation), if these effects are not
properly taken into account. In this article we quantify the CMOD effects for

approach the stellar-mass BH in a gradual, nearly circular inspiral, under the

the mass of the star is slowly stripped away by the BH. We call this gradual

the light scalars are performed in many ongoing experiments and planned for the
next generation projects. Applying dispersion relations changes the leading

221009A offers a unique opportunity to probe the connection between massive
star core collapse and relativistic jet formation across a very broad range of
$\gamma$-ray properties. Adopting a phenomenological power-law model for the
afterglow and host galaxy estimates from high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope
imaging, we use Bayesian model comparison techniques to determine the
likelihood of an associated SN contributing excess flux to the optical light
curve. Though not conclusive, we find moderate evidence
($K_{\rm{Bayes}}=10^{1.2}$) for the presence of an additional component arising
from an associated supernova, SN 2022xiw, and find that it must be
substantially fainter ($<$ 67% as bright at the 99% confidence interval) than
SN 1998bw. Given the large and uncertain line-of-sight extinction, we attempt
to constrain the supernova parameters ($M_{\mathrm{Ni}}$, $M_{\mathrm{ej}}$,
and $E_{\mathrm{KE}}$) under several different assumptions with respect to the
host galaxy's extinction. We find properties that are broadly consistent with
previous GRB-associated SNe: $M_{\rm{Ni}}=0.05$ - $0.25 \, \rm{M_\odot}$,
$M_{\rm{ej}}=3.5$ - $11.1 \, \rm{M_\odot}$, and $E_{\rm{KE}} = (1.6$ - $5.2)
\times 10^{52} \, \rm{erg}$. We note that these properties are weakly
constrained due to the faintness of the supernova with respect to the afterglow
and host emission, but we do find a robust upper limit on the $M_{\rm{Ni}}$ of
$M_{\rm{Ni}}<0.36\, \rm{M_\odot}$. Given the tremendous range in isotropic
gamma-ray energy release exhibited by GRBs (7 orders of magnitude), the SN

a $2$-approximation via combinatorial local-ratio methods (Bafna, Berman and

algorithms (Chudak, Goemans, Hochbaum and Williamson, Operations Research
Letters '98). Despite the existence of these algorithms for several decades,
there is no known polynomial-time solvable LP relaxation for FVS with a
provable integrality gap of at most $2$. More recent work (Chekuri and Madan
SODA '16) developed a polynomial-sized LP relaxation for a more general
problem, namely Subset FVS, and showed that its integrality gap is at most $13$
for Subset FVS, and hence also for FVS.

FVS and related problems. In this work, we formulate new integer linear
programs (ILPs) for FVS whose LP-relaxation can be solved in polynomial time,
and whose integrality gap is at most $2$. The new insights in this process also
enable us to prove that the formulation in (Chekuri and Madan, SODA '16) has an
integrality gap of at most $2$ for FVS. Our results for FVS are inspired by new
formulations and polyhedral results for the closely-related pseudoforest
deletion set problem (PFDS). Our formulations for PFDS are in turn inspired by
a connection to the densest subgraph problem. We also conjecture an extreme

simulation without AGN feedback, the galaxy experiences a rapid starburst and
shrinking of its half-mass radius. We experiment with driving mechanical AGN
winds, using a state-of-the-art hyper-Lagrangian refinement technique to
increase particle resolution. These winds reduce the gas surface density in the
inner regions of the galaxy, suppressing the compact starburst and maintaining
an approximately constant half-mass radius. Using radiative transfer, we study
the impact of AGN feedback on the magnitude and extent of the multi-wavelength
continuum emission. When AGN winds are included, the suppression of the
compact, dusty starburst results in lowered flux at FIR wavelengths (due to
decreased star formation) but increased flux at optical-to-near-IR wavelengths
(due to decreased dust attenuation, in spite of the lowered star formation
rate), relative to the case without AGN winds. The FIR half-light radius
decreases from ~1 kpc to ~0.1 kpc in <40 Myr when AGN winds are not included,
but increases to ~2 kpc when they are. Interestingly, the half-light radius at
optical-NIR wavelengths remains approximately constant over 35 Myr, for
simulations with and without AGN winds. In the case without winds, this occurs
despite the rapid compaction, and is due to heavy dust obscuration in the inner

language model pretraining by creating additional unsupervised training
sentences that mask a single entity or date span, thus oversampling factual
information. Despite the success of this paradigm, the span types and sampling
strategies are relatively arbitrary and not widely studied for other tasks.
Thus, we investigate SSM from the perspective of temporal tasks, where learning
a good representation of various temporal expressions is important. To that
end, we introduce Temporal Span Masking (TSM) intermediate training. First, we
find that SSM alone improves the downstream performance on three temporal tasks
by an avg. +5.8 points. Further, we are able to achieve additional improvements
(avg. +0.29 points) by adding the TSM task. These comprise the new best
reported results on the targeted tasks. Our analysis suggests that the

still improve performance, especially in a zero-shot context.

trained on data cubes extracted from paired fully sampled sinograms and
down-sampled sinograms, is employed to inpaint down-sampled sinograms. Our

neighbors to any two nodes in a network. How to efficiently distribute
entanglement over large-scale networks is still an open problem that greatly
depends on the technology considered. In this work, we consider quantum
networks composed of photonic channels characterized by a trade-off between the
entanglement generation rate and fidelity. For such networks we look at the two
following problems: the one of finding the best path to connect any two given
nodes in the network bipartite entanglement routing, and the problem of finding
the best starting node in order to connect three nodes in the network
multipartite entanglement routing. We consider two entanglement distribution
models: one where entangled qubit are distributed one at a time, and a flow
model where a large number of entangled qubits are distributed simultaneously.
We propose the use of continuous fidelity curves (i.e., entanglement generation
fidelity vs rate) as the main routing metric. Combined with multi-objective
path-finding algorithms, the fidelity curves describing each link allow finding
a set of paths that maximize both the end-to-end fidelity and the entanglement
generation rate. For the models and networks considered, we prove that the
algorithm always converges to the optimal solution, and we show through
simulation that its execution time grows polynomial with the number of nodes in
the network. Our implementation grows with the number of nodes with a power
between $1$ and $1.4$ depending on the network. This work paves the way for the
development of path-finding algorithms for networks with complex entanglement
distribution protocols, in particular for other protocols that exhibit a
trade-off between generation fidelity and rate, such as repeater-and-purify
protocols.

shown that for a general-relativity neutral black-hole background the
conductivities at any frequency and momentum are independent of the choice of

center, and assess the signal detectability by the planned space-borne
interferometer LISA and by the proposed next generation space-borne
interferometer $\mu$Ares. Assuming that PBHs indeed form the entire diffuse
mass allowed to reside within the orbit of the S2 star, we compute an upper
limit to the expected GW signal both from resolved and non-resolved sources,
under the further assumptions of monochromatic mass function and thermally
distributed eccentricities. By comparing with our previous work where PBHs on
circular orbits were assumed, we show how the GW signal from high harmonics
over a 10 year data stream increases by a factor of six the chances of LISA
detectability, from the $\approx 10\%$ of the circular case, to $\approx 60\%$,
whereas multiple sources can be identified in $20\%$ of our mock populations.
The background signal, made by summing up all non resolved sources, should be
detectable thanks to the PBHs with higher eccentricity evolving under two body
relaxation. In the case of $\mu$Ares, because of its improved sensitivity in
the $\mu$Hz band, one third of the entire population of PBHs orbiting Sgr

safety-critical settings (e.g., a clinician working with a medical AI system).
However, mitigating risks arising from human error and uncertainty within such
human-AI interactions is an important and understudied issue. In this work, we
study human uncertainty in the context of concept-based models, a family of AI
systems that enable human feedback via concept interventions where an expert
intervenes on human-interpretable concepts relevant to the task. Prior work in
this space often assumes that humans are oracles who are always certain and
correct. Yet, real-world decision-making by humans is prone to occasional
mistakes and uncertainty. We study how existing concept-based models deal with
uncertain interventions from humans using two novel datasets: UMNIST, a visual
dataset with controlled simulated uncertainty based on the MNIST dataset, and
CUB-S, a relabeling of the popular CUB concept dataset with rich,
densely-annotated soft labels from humans. We show that training with uncertain
concept labels may help mitigate weaknesses of concept-based systems when
handling uncertain interventions. These results allow us to identify several
open challenges, which we argue can be tackled through future multidisciplinary
research on building interactive uncertainty-aware systems. To facilitate
further research, we release a new elicitation platform, UElic, to collect
uncertain feedback from humans in collaborative prediction tasks.

plasma wave that traps and accelerates electrons to relativistic energies. When
the pulse overlaps the accelerated electrons, it can enhance the energy gain
through direct laser acceleration (DLA) by resonantly driving the betatron
oscillations of the electrons in the plasma wave. The particle-in-cell (PIC)
algorithm, although often the tool of choice to study DLA, contains inherent
errors due to numerical dispersion and the time staggering of the electric and
magnetic fields. Further, conventional PIC implementations cannot reliably
disentangle the fields of the plasma wave and laser pulse, which obscures
interpretation of the dominant acceleration mechanism. Here, a customized field
solver that reduces errors from both numerical dispersion and time staggering
is used in conjunction with a field decomposition into azimuthal modes to
perform PIC simulations of DLA in an LWFA. Comparisons with traditional PIC
methods, model equations, and experimental data show improved accuracy with the
customized solver and convergence with an order-of-magnitude fewer cells. The
azimuthal-mode decomposition reveals that the most energetic electrons receive
comparable energy from DLA and LWFA.

spin-orbit coupling. In general, stronger spin-orbit coupling favors larger
SHEs but shorter spin relaxation times and diffusion lengths. To achieve both
large SHEs and long-range spin transport in a single material has remained a
challenge. Here we demonstrate a giant intrinsic SHE in AB-stacked MoTe2/WSe2

the giant SHE occurs only near the Chern insulating state, and at low

  Narratives Classification","Submitted to IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics",,,,"cs.CL eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In recent years, Transformer-based models such as the Switch Transformer have
achieved remarkable results in natural language processing tasks. However,
these models are often too complex and require extensive pre-training, which
limits their effectiveness for small clinical text classification tasks with
limited data. In this study, we propose a simplified Switch Transformer
framework and train it from scratch on a small French clinical text
classification dataset at CHU Sainte-Justine hospital. Our results demonstrate
that the simplified small-scale Transformer models outperform pre-trained
BERT-based models, including DistillBERT, CamemBERT, FlauBERT, and FrALBERT.
Additionally, using a mixture of expert mechanisms from the Switch Transformer
helps capture diverse patterns; hence, the proposed approach achieves better
results than a conventional Transformer with the self-attention mechanism.
Finally, our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 87\%, precision at
87\%, and recall at 85\%, compared to the third-best pre-trained BERT-based
model, FlauBERT, which achieved an accuracy of 84\%, precision at 84\%, and
recall at 84\%. However, Switch Transformers have limitations, including a
generalization gap and sharp minima. We compare it with a multi-layer
perceptron neural network for small French clinical narratives classification
and show that the latter outperforms all other models.

extended gapless electronic states characterized as nodal lines or rings.
Strain induced modifications to these states lead to emergence of different
classes of nodal rings with qualitatively different physical properties. Here
we study optical response and the electromagnetic wave propagation in type I
nodal ring semimetals, in which the low-energy quasiparticle dispersion is
parabolic in momentum $k_x$ and $k_y$ and is linear in $k_z$. This leads to a
highly anisotropic dielectric permittivity tensor in which the optical response
is plasmonic in one spatial direction and dielectric in the other two
directions. The resulting normal modes (polaritons) in the bulk material become
hyperbolic over a broad frequency range, which is furthermore tunable by the
doping level. The propagation, reflection, and polarization properties of the
hyperbolic polaritons not only provide valuable information about the
electronic structure of these fascinating materials in the most interesting
region near the nodal rings but also pave the way to tunable hyperbolic
materials with applications ranging from anomalous refraction and waveguiding
to perfect absorption in ultrathin subwavelength films.

many-body systems and are associated to interesting phenomena such as the
generation of long-range order and spontaneous symmetry breaking. They can be
defined through the non-analytic behavior of thermodynamic potentials in the
thermodynamic limit. This limit is obtained when the number of available
configurations of the system approaches infinity, which is conventionally
associated to spatially-extended systems formed by an infinite number of
degrees of freedom (infinite number of particles or modes). Taking previous
ideas to the extreme, we argue that such a limit can be defined even in
non-extended systems, providing a specific example in the simplest form of a
single-mode bosonic Hamiltonian. In contrast to previous non-extended models,
the simplicity of our model allows us to find approximate analytical
expressions that can be confronted with precise numerical simulations in all
the parameter space, particularly as close to the thermodynamic limit as we
want. We are thus able to show that the system undergoes a change displaying
all the characteristics of a second-order phase transition as a function of a
control parameter. We derive critical exponents and scaling laws revealing the
universality class of the model, which coincide with that of more elaborate
non-extended models such as the quantum Rabi or Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models.
Analyzing our model, we are also able to offer insights into the features of
this type of phase transitions, by showing that the thermodynamic and classical
limits coincide. In other words, quantum fluctuations must be tamed in order
for the system to undergo a true phase transition.

rotation axis. This often gives rise to highly spatially anisotropic columnar
structures that in combination with complex domain boundaries pose challenges
for efficient numerical discretizations and computations. We define gyroscopic
polynomials to be three-dimensional polynomials expressed in a coordinate
system that conforms to rotational alignment. We remap the original domain with
radius-dependent boundaries onto a right cylindrical or annular domain to
create the computational domain in this coordinate system. We find the volume
element expressed in gyroscopic coordinates leads naturally to a hierarchy of
orthonormal bases. We build the bases out of Jacobi polynomials in the vertical
and generalized Jacobi polynomials in the radial. Because these coordinates
explicitly conform to flow structures found in rapidly rotating systems the
bases represent fields with a relatively small number of modes. We develop the
operator structure for one-dimensional semi-classical orthogonal polynomials as
a building block for differential operators in the full three-dimensional
cylindrical and annular domains. The differential operators of generalized
Jacobi polynomials generate a sparse linear system for discretization of
differential operators acting on the gyroscopic bases. This enables efficient

Data sparsity in GNN inference, including sparsity in the input graph and the

pruning techniques have been proposed for model compression that increase the
data sparsity of GNNs. We propose Dynasparse, a comprehensive hardware-software
codesign on FPGA to accelerate GNN inference through dynamic sparsity
exploitation. For this, we decouple the GNN computation kernels from the basic
computation primitives, and explore hardware-software codesign as follows: 1)
Hardware design: We propose a novel unified accelerator design on FPGA to
efficiently execute various computation primitives. We develop a customized
soft processor that is tightly coupled with the accelerator to execute a
runtime system. Moreover, we develop efficient hardware mechanisms to profile
the data sparsity and perform on-the-fly data format transformation to prepare
the input data for various computation primitives; 2) Software design: We
develop a runtime system that works synergistically with the accelerator to
perform dynamic kernel-to-primitive mapping based on data sparsity. We
implement Dynasparse on a state-of-the-art FPGA platform, Xilinx Alveo U250,
and evaluate the design using widely used GNN models (GCN, GraphSAGE, GIN and
SGC). For the above GNN models and various input graphs, the proposed
accelerator and dynamic kernel-to-primitive mapping reduces the inference
latency by $3.73\times$ on the average compared with the static mapping
strategies employed in the state-of-the-art GNN accelerators. Compared with

to arise from the collapse of massive stars \cite{Hjorth+03}, with a small
proportion created from the merger of compact objects. Most of these systems
are likely formed via standard stellar evolution pathways. However, it has long
been thought that a fraction of GRBs may instead be an outcome of dynamical
interactions in dense environments, channels which could also contribute
significantly to the samples of compact object mergers detected as
gravitational wave sources. Here we report the case of GRB 191019A, a long GRB
(T_90 = 64.4 +/- 4.5 s) which we pinpoint close (<100 pc projected) to the
nucleus of an ancient (>1~Gyr old) host galaxy at z=0.248. The lack of evidence
for star formation and deep limits on any supernova emission make a massive
star origin difficult to reconcile with observations, while the timescales of
the emission rule out a direct interaction with the supermassive black hole in
the nucleus of the galaxy, We suggest that the most likely route for progenitor
formation is via dynamical interactions in the dense nucleus of the host,
consistent with the centres of such galaxies exhibiting interaction rates up to
two orders of magnitude larger than typical field galaxies. The burst
properties could naturally be explained via compact object mergers involving
white dwarfs (WD), neutron stars (NS) or black holes (BH). These may form
dynamically in dense stellar clusters, or originate in a gaseous disc around
the supermassive black hole. Future electromagnetic and gravitational-wave
observations in tandem thus offer a route to probe the dynamical fraction and
the details of dynamical interactions in galactic nuclei and other high density
stellar systems.

ablation studies performed with the CholecT45 challenge data via
cross-validation, the biggest performance boost is achieved by the usage of
soft labels obtained by self-distillation. External validation of our method on

cloud geometry compression to point cloud attribute compression. To losslessly
encode the attribute while maintaining a low bitrate, accurate probability
prediction is critical. With this aim, we extensively exploit cross-scale,
cross-group, and cross-color correlations of point cloud attribute to ensure
accurate probability estimation and thus high coding efficiency. Specifically,
we first generate multiscale attribute tensors through average pooling, by
which, for any two consecutive scales, the decoded lower-scale attribute can be
used to estimate the attribute probability in the current scale in one shot.
Additionally, in each scale, we perform the probability estimation group-wisely
following a predefined grouping pattern. In this way, both cross-scale and
(same-scale) cross-group correlations are exploited jointly. Furthermore,
cross-color redundancy is removed by allowing inter-color processing for
YCoCg/RGB alike multi-channel attributes. The proposed method not only
demonstrates state-of-the-art compression efficiency with significant
performance gains over the latest G-PCC on various contents but also sustains
low complexity with affordable encoding and decoding runtime.

the relaxation of the internal energy in nano-sized particles and its impact on
the nucleation of atomic clusters. Quantum-mechanical potentials were utilized
to analyze the growth and collision relaxation of the internal energy of
Ar$_n$H$^+$ clusters in a metastable Ar gas. The results revealed that small
nano-clusters are formed in highly excited rotational-vibrational states, and
the relaxation of internal energy and growth of these nascent clusters are
concurrent processes with a strong mutual influence. Under non-equilibrium
growth conditions, the relaxation of internal energy can delay the cluster
growth process. The rates of cluster growth and internal energy relaxation were
found to be influenced by energy-transfer collisions between cluster particles
and free Ar atoms of the bath gas. Furthermore, the non-equilibrium growth and
internal energy relaxation of small nano-clusters were found to depend on the
structure of the cluster's atomic shells. An ensemble of molecular dynamics
simulations were conducted to investigate the growth, time-evolution of kinetic
and total energies of Ar$_n$H$^+$ clusters with specified $n \leq 11$, and the
results were explained by collisional relaxation processes described by the

[STOC '22] to describe randomized algorithms that are stable under the
resampling of their inputs. More precisely, a replicable algorithm gives the
same output with high probability when its randomness is fixed and it is run on
a new i.i.d. sample drawn from the same distribution. Using replicable
algorithms for data analysis can facilitate the verification of published
results by ensuring that the results of an analysis will be the same with high
probability, even when that analysis is performed on a new data set.
  In this work, we establish new connections and separations between
replicability and standard notions of algorithmic stability. In particular, we
give sample-efficient algorithmic reductions between perfect generalization,
approximate differential privacy, and replicability for a broad class of
statistical problems. Conversely, we show any such equivalence must break down
computationally: there exist statistical problems that are easy under
differential privacy, but that cannot be solved replicably without breaking
public-key cryptography. Furthermore, these results are tight: our reductions
are statistically optimal, and we show that any computational separation
between DP and replicability must imply the existence of one-way functions.
  Our statistical reductions give a new algorithmic framework for translating
between notions of stability, which we instantiate to answer several open
questions in replicability and privacy. This includes giving sample-efficient
replicable algorithms for various PAC learning, distribution estimation, and
distribution testing problems, algorithmic amplification of $\delta$ in
approximate DP, conversions from item-level to user-level privacy, and the
existence of private agnostic-to-realizable learning reductions under
structured distributions.

First, we verify influence functions using procedures from the literature under
conditions where the convexity assumptions of influence functions are met.
Then, we relax these assumptions and study the effects of non-convexity by
using deeper models and more complex datasets. Here, we analyze the key metrics

experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as well as the
significance of multi-scale cross-modal perception and dependency modeling for

Furthermore, we observe no correlation between the observed lower bound on the

DBT for quantum optics experiments. In light of previous reports of low QE

experiment results show that, on average, our system's end-to-end latency to
notify the end users in case of detecting suspicious objects is 5.3, 5.78, and

demonstrate that the system effectively detects and notifies abnormal behaviors

seconds duration, are associated with different progenitors: the collapse of a
massive star and the merger of two compact objects, respectively. GRB 191019A
was a long GRB ($T_{90}\sim64$ s). Despite the relatively small redshift
z=0.248 and HST followup observations, an accompanying supernova was not
detected. In addition, the host galaxy did not have significant star formation
activity. Here we propose that GRB 191019A was produced by a binary compact
merger, whose prompt emission was stretched in time by the interaction with a
dense external medium. This would be expected if the burst progenitor was
located in the disk of an active galactic nucleus, as supported by the burst
localization close to the center of its host galaxy. We show that the light
curve of GRB 191019A can be well modeled by a burst of intrinsic duration t=1.1
s and of energy $E_{\rm{iso}}=10^{51}$ erg seen moderately off-axis, exploding
in a medium of density $10^7-10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. The double-peaked light curve
carries the telltale features predicted for GRBs in high-density media, where
the first peak is produced by the photosphere, and the second by the overlap of
reverse shocks that take place before the internal shocks could happen. This
would make GRB 191019A the first confirmed stellar explosion from within an

to the systems that are generalizable to real-life scenarios. The models are
fine-tuned and fed into a Feed-Forward Neural Network and a Bidirectional Long

Machine are used as traditional baselines. The results show that, in binary
text classification, DistilBERT is significantly better than ELMo on
generalizing to the cross-context setting. ELMo is observed to be significantly
more robust to the cross-context test data than both baselines. On the other
hand, the baselines performed comparably well to ELMo when the training and
test data are subsets of the same corpus (no cross-context). DistilBERT is also
found to be 30% smaller and 83% faster than ELMo. The results suggest that
DistilBERT can transfer generic semantic knowledge to other domains better than
ELMo. DistilBERT is also favorable in incorporating into real-life systems for
it requires a smaller computational training budget. When generalization is not
the utmost preference and test domain is similar to the training domain, the
traditional ML algorithms can still be considered as more economic alternatives
to deep language representations.

even as countries such as the USA have made significant investments in wireless
infrastructure, rapidly deployable nodes, and an increase in commercial

response, nine drone teams flew 34 missions under the direction of the State of

Newton's intellectual choices, at how and why precisely he would occupy himself
with specific text-sources, and how this interest fits into the larger picture
of his scientific and intellectual endeavours. In what follows, we shall follow
Newton into his study and look over his shoulder while reading compendia and
original source-texts in his personal library at Cambridge, meticulously
investigating and comparing fragments and commentaries, and carefully keeping
track in private notes of how they support his own developing ideas. Indeed,
Newton was convinced that precursors to his own insights and discoveries were
present already in Antiquity, even before the Greeks, in ancient Egypt, and he
puts a lot of time and effort into making the point, especially, and not
incidentially, in the period between the first and the second edition of the
Principia. A clear understanding of his reading of the classic sources
therefore matters to our understanding of its content and gestation process. In
what follows we will confine ourselves to the classical legacy, and investigate

dimensional output is available. To bridge this gap, we present in this paper
an output-feedback STC approach for nonlinear NCS. An asymptotically stable
observer is used to reconstruct the plant state and transmission times are
determined based on the observer state. The approach employs hybrid Lyapunov
functions and a dynamic variable to encode past state information and to
maximize the time between transmissions. It is non-conservative in the sense
that the assumptions on plant and controller are the same as for dynamic STC
based on hybrid Lyapunov functions with full state measurements and any
asymptotically stabilizing observer can be used. We conclude that the proposed
STC approach guarantees asymptotic stability of the origin for the closed-loop

Extreme air quality events tend to occur without a strong signal leading up to

forecasting in the presence of extreme air quality events due to its ability to
generalize and learn nonlinear problems. However, in the presence of these

focus on a Markovian dissipative state preparation scheme where the prepared

quantum speed limit (QSL) that offers a more refined measure of the actual
evolution time compared to the commonly used initial-state-independent
relaxation time. This allows for a passive optimization of dissipative
evolution across different initial states. By minimizing the dissipated heat
during the preparation process, conditioned on the minimization of evolution
time using the QSL, we find that the preferred initial state has a specific
permutation of diagonal elements with respect to an ordered energy eigenbasis
of increasing eigenvalues. In this configuration, the population on the
prepared state is the largest, and the remaining diagonal elements are sorted
in an order resembling that of a passive state in the same ordered energy
eigenbasis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy in a dissipative
Rydberg atom system for preparing the Bell state. Our work provides new

context-awareness - a detailed knowledge of the environmental, user, social and
system conditions in which an AR experience takes place. This will facilitate
both the closer integration of the real and virtual worlds, and the provision
of context-specific content or adaptations. However, environmental awareness in
particular is challenging to achieve using AR devices alone; not only are these
mobile devices' view of an environment spatially and temporally limited, but
the data obtained by onboard sensors is frequently inaccurate and incomplete.
This, combined with the fact that many aspects of core AR functionality and
user experiences are impacted by properties of the real environment, motivates
the use of ambient IoT devices, wireless sensors and actuators placed in the
surrounding environment, for the measurement and optimization of environment
properties. In this book chapter we categorize and examine the wide variety of
ways in which these IoT sensors and actuators can support or enhance AR
experiences, including quantitative insights and proof-of-concept systems that
will inform the development of future solutions. We outline the challenges and
opportunities associated with several important research directions which must
be addressed to realize the full potential of next-generation AR.

described by nonlinear partial differential equations, is crucial in various
scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational fluid
dynamics based solvers are inadequate to handle the increasing demand for
large-scale and long-period simulations. The ever-increasing availability of
data and rapid advancement in deep learning (DL) have opened new avenues to
tackle these challenges through data-enabled modeling. The seamless integration
of DL and classic numerical techniques through the differentiable programming
framework can significantly improve data-driven modeling performance. In this
study, we propose a differentiable hybrid neural modeling framework for
efficient simulation of FSI problems, where the numerically discretized FSI
physics based on the immersed boundary method is seamlessly integrated with
sequential neural networks using differentiable programming. All modules are
programmed in JAX, where automatic differentiation enables gradient
back-propagation over the entire model rollout trajectory, allowing the hybrid
neural FSI model to be trained as a whole in an end-to-end,
sequence-to-sequence manner. Through several FSI benchmark cases, we
demonstrate the merit and capability of the proposed method in modeling FSI
dynamics for both rigid and flexible bodies. The proposed model has also
demonstrated its superiority over baseline purely data-driven neural models,
weakly-coupled hybrid neural models, and purely numerical FSI solvers in terms
of accuracy, robustness, and generalizability.

coupling starlight into a much smaller, single-mode fiber may be possible. In
general, a spectrometer designed for single-mode fiber input will be
substantially less costly than one designed for multi-mode fiber input. We
describe the results of tests coupling starlight from a 70 cm telescope at Mt.
Hopkins, Arizona into the single-mode fiber of the MINERVA-Red spectrometer at
a wavelength of ~850 nm using a low-speed tip/tilt image stabilization system
comprising all commercial, off-the-shelf components. We find that approximately
0.5% of the available starlight is coupled into the single-mode fiber under

polymer melts to investigate the formation of shear banding. Under high shear
rates, shear banding occurs, which is accompanied by the entanglement
heterogeneity intimately. Interestingly, the same linear relationship between
the end-to-end distance $R_{ee}$ and entanglement density $Z$ is observed at
homogeneous flow before the onset of shear banding and at stable shear banding
state, where $R_{ee} \sim [ln(W_i^2)- \xi_0]Z$ is proposed as the criterion to
describe the dynamic force balance of molecular chain in flow with a high rate.
We establish a scaling relation between the disentanglement rate $V_d$ and
Weissenberg number $W_i$ as $V_d \sim W_i^2$ for stable flow. Deviating from
this relation leads to force imbalance and results in the emergence of shear
banding. The formation of shear banding prevents chain from further stretching
and untangling. The transition from homogeneous shear to shear banding
partially dissipates the increased free energy from shear and reduces the free
energy of the system.

addition, we show that the optimization objective as a function of the policy
parameter and reward satisfies a stronger ""equiconnectedness"" property. To our

equations and Menter's SST turbulence model, the present study uses the newly

computations. First, computations are performed for the 3D interaction

are then extended to cases with AOA = 10-deg and 5-deg. For comparison, 2D
axisymmetric counterparts of the 3D interactions are investigated for cones
coaxial with the tube and having half-cone angles of 27.35-deg, 24.81-deg, and
20.96-deg. The shock wave structure, vortex structure, variable distributions,

that in 2D/3D interactions, a new Mach reflection-like event occurs and a Mach
stem-like structure is generated above the front of the separation bubble,
which differs from the model of Babinsky for 2D planar shock wave/boundary
layer interaction. A new interaction model is established to describe this
behavior. The relationship between the length of the circumferentially
unseparated region in the tube and the AOA of the cone indicates the existence
of a critical AOA at which the length is zero, and a prediction of this angle
is obtained using an empirical fit, which is verified by computation. The
occurrence of side overflow in the windward meridional plane is analyzed, and a
quantitative knowledge is obtained. To elucidate the characteristics of the 3D

nondifferentiable regularizer. To resolve it, an online proximal gradient
algorithm is studied for two distinct scenarios, including convex and strongly
convex objectives without the smooth condition. In both scenarios, unlike most
of works, an extended version of the conventional path variation is employed to
bound the considered performance metric, i.e., dynamic regret. In the convex
scenario, a bound $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T^{1-\beta}D_\beta(T)+T})$ is obtained
which is comparable to the best-known result, where $D_\beta(T)$ is the
extended path variation with $\beta\in[0,1)$ and $T$ being the total number of
rounds. In strongly convex case, a bound $\mathcal{O}(\log
T(1+T^{-\beta}D_\beta(T)))$ on the dynamic regret is established. In the end,
numerical examples are presented to support the theoretical findings.

Under our framework, we propose an adaptively splitting dataset-based defense
(ASD). Concretely, we apply loss-guided split and meta-learning-inspired split
to dynamically update two data pools. With the split clean data pool and
polluted data pool, ASD successfully defends against backdoor attacks during

proposed to make image features also have text-space semantic correlations by
supervising the similarity between image features and text features. On top of
the collaboration of multifarious token heads, diverse global receptive fields
with multi-modal semantic cues are captured, thereby delivering superb learning
capability. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed FER-former over the existing state-of-the-arts.

significant advantages in fast adaptation and convergence over heterogeneous

explicitly addressing how much benefit MAML brings to FL and how to maximize
such benefit over mobile edge networks. In this paper, we quantify the benefit
from two aspects: optimizing FL hyperparameters (i.e., sampled data size and
the number of communication rounds) and resource allocation (i.e., transmit

However, coordinating a swarm of intermittent computing nodes requires frequent

decomposing and reorganizing the generic KD loss into a Normalized KD (NKD)
loss and customized soft labels for both target class (image's category) and
non-target classes named Universal Self-Knowledge Distillation (USKD). We
decompose the KD loss and find the non-target loss from it forces the student's
non-target logits to match the teacher's, but the sum of the two non-target
logits is different, preventing them from being identical. NKD normalizes the
non-target logits to equalize their sum. It can be generally used for KD and
self-KD to better use the soft labels for distillation loss. USKD generates
customized soft labels for both target and non-target classes without a

and uses the rank of the intermediate feature to generate the soft non-target
labels with Zipf's law. For KD with teachers, our NKD achieves state-of-the-art

have been proposed in literature for this task, but they have serious
shortcomings such as a lack of realistic outputs, long inference times, and
strong requirements for the data set and accessibility of the face recognition

conditional diffusion model loss naturally emerges and that we can effectively

guarantee reliable or fair ML models. This is partially due to the fact that

designed test set to assess ML models' failures, fairness, or robustness, this
paper proposes Semantic Image Attack (SIA), a method based on the adversarial
attack that provides semantic adversarial images to allow model diagnosis,
interpretability, and robustness. Traditional adversarial training is a popular
methodology for robustifying ML models against attacks. However, existing
adversarial methods do not combine the two aspects that enable the
interpretation and analysis of the model's flaws: semantic traceability and
perceptual quality. SIA combines the two features via iterative gradient ascent
on a predefined semantic attribute space and the image space. We illustrate the
validity of our approach in three scenarios for keypoint detection and
classification. (1) Model diagnosis: SIA generates a histogram of attributes
that highlights the semantic vulnerability of the ML model (i.e., attributes
that make the model fail). (2) Stronger attacks: SIA generates adversarial
examples with visually interpretable attributes that lead to higher attack
success rates than baseline methods. The adversarial training on SIA improves
the transferable robustness across different gradient-based attacks. (3)
Robustness to imbalanced datasets: we use SIA to augment the underrepresented
classes, which outperforms strong augmentation and re-balancing baselines.

locations on multilane roadways because an AV cannot detect crossing
pedestrians that are fully occluded by downstream vehicles in adjacent lanes.
This paper tests the capability of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
between an AV and its downstream vehicles to share midblock pedestrian
crossings information. The researchers developed a V2V-based
collision-avoidance decision strategy and compared it to a base scenario (i.e.,
decision strategy without the utilization of V2V). Simulation results showed
that for the base scenario, the near-zero time-to-collision (TTC) indicated no
time for the AV to take appropriate action and resulted in dramatic braking
followed by collisions. But the V2V-based collision-avoidance decision strategy
allowed for a proportional braking approach to increase the TTC allowing the
pedestrian to cross safely. To conclude, the V2V-based collision-avoidance
decision strategy has higher safety benefits for an AV interacting with fully
occluded pedestrians at midblock locations on multilane roadways.

address these issues, we propose a novel federated uncertainty-aware

and produces a confidence estimation for the DR staging. In our FedUAA, an
aggregated encoder is shared by all clients for learning a global
representation of fundus images, while a novel temperature-warmed uncertainty
head (TWEU) is utilized for each client for local personalized staging
criteria. Our TWEU employs an evidential deep layer to produce the uncertainty
score with the DR staging results for client reliability evaluation.
Furthermore, we developed a novel uncertainty-aware weighting module (UAW) to
dynamically adjust the weights of model aggregation based on the uncertainty
score distribution of each client. In our experiments, we collect five publicly
available datasets from different institutions to conduct a dataset for
federated DR staging to satisfy the real non-iid condition. The experimental
results demonstrate that our FedUAA achieves better DR staging performance with
higher reliability compared to other federated learning methods. Our proposed
FedUAA paradigm effectively addresses the challenges of collaboratively

far field and near field are respectively unveiled, paving the way for
discretization of phase shift for RIS. Then, aiming at aligning phases, the
phase distribution law and its underlying degree-of-freedom (DoF) are
characterized, serving as the guideline of phase quantization strategies.
Subsequently, two phase quantization methods, dynamic threshold phase
quantization (DTPQ) and equal interval phase quantization (EIPQ), are proposed
to strengthen the beamforming effect of RIS. DTPQ is capable of calculating the
optimal discrete phase shifts with linear complexity in the number of unit
cells on RIS, whilst EIPQ is a simplified method with a constant complexity
yielding sub-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that both methods
achieve substantial improvements on power gain, stability, and robustness over
traditional quantization methods. The path loss (PL) scaling law under discrete
phase shift of RIS is unveiled for the first time, with the phase shifts
designed by DTPQ due to its optimality. Additionally, the field trials

examples of a vertical superconducting diode effect have been reported and its
mechanism, especially whether intrinsic or extrinsic, remains elusive. Here we
demonstrate a substantial supercurrent non-reciprocity in a van der Waals
vertical Josephson junction formed with a Td-WTe2 barrier and NbSe2 electrodes
that clearly reflects the intrinsic crystal structure of Td-WTe2. The Josephson
diode efficiency increases with the Td-WTe2 thickness up to critical thickness,
and all junctions, irrespective of the barrier thickness, reveal magneto-chiral
characteristics with respect to a mirror plane of Td-WTe2. Our results,
together with the twist-angle-tuned magneto-chirality of a Td-WTe2
double-barrier junction, show that two-dimensional materials promise vertical
Josephson diodes with high efficiency and tunability.

foreground object and background scene features with high-level semantics by
taking advantage of pre-trained video parsing models. Then, building upon the
autoencoder-based reconstruction framework, we introduce both scene-level and
object-level contrastive learning to enforce the encoded latent features to be
compact within the same semantic classes while being separable across different

diversity of normal patterns and also increases their discrimination ability.
Moreover, for the sake of tackling rare normal activities, we design a
skeleton-based motion augmentation to increase samples and refine the model

introduce an AIGC-as-a-Service (AaaS) architecture, which deploys AIGC models

Metaverse users. Nonetheless, a key aspect of providing personalized user
experiences requires the careful selection of AIGC service providers (ASPs)
capable of effectively executing user tasks. This selection process is
complicated by environmental uncertainty and variability, a challenge not yet
addressed well in existing literature. Therefore, we first propose a diffusion
model-based AI-generated optimal decision (AGOD) algorithm, which can generate
the optimal ASP selection decisions. We then apply AGOD to deep reinforcement
learning (DRL), resulting in the Deep Diffusion Soft Actor-Critic (D2SAC)
algorithm, which achieves efficient and effective ASP selection. Our
comprehensive experiments demonstrate that D2SAC outperforms seven leading DRL
algorithms. Furthermore, the proposed AGOD algorithm has the potential for
extension to various optimization problems in wireless networks, positioning it
a promising approach for the future research on AIGC-driven services in

is challenging because it involves searching over a vast input space of initial
conditions, along with modeling their evolution via tools such as N-body
simulations which are computationally expensive. Deep learning has emerged as
an alternate modeling tool that can learn the mapping between the linear input
of an N-body simulation and the final nonlinear displacements at redshift zero,
which can significantly accelerate the forward modeling. However, this does not
help reduce the search space for initial conditions. In this paper, we
demonstrate for the first time that a deep learning model can be trained for
the reverse mapping. We train a V-Net based convolutional neural network, which
outputs the linear displacement of an N-body system, given the current time
nonlinear displacement and the cosmological parameters of the system. We
demonstrate that this neural network accurately recovers the initial linear
displacement field over a wide range of scales ($<1$-$2\%$ error up to nearly
$k = 1\ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}\,h$), despite the ill-defined nature of the inverse
problem at smaller scales. Specifically, smaller scales are dominated by
nonlinear effects which makes the backward dynamics much more susceptible to
numerical and computational errors leading to highly divergent backward
trajectories and a one-to-many backward mapping. The results of our method
motivate that neural network based models can act as good approximators of the
initial linear states and their predictions can serve as good starting points

evolution of massive stars.
  We extend the evolution models introduced in Paper I, where the mass loss
recipe is based on the simultaneous calculation of the wind hydrodynamics and
the line-acceleration, by incorporating the effects of stellar rotation. We
introduce a grid of self-consistent line-force parameters for a set of standard
evolutionary tracks. With that, we generate a new set of evolutionary tracks
with rotation for $M_\text{ZAMS}=25,40,70,$ and $120\,M_\odot$, and
metallicities $Z=0.014$ and $0.006$.
  The self-consistent approach gives lower mass loss rates than the standard
values adopted in previous evolution models. This decrease impacts strongly on
the tracks of the most massive models. Weaker winds allow the star to retain
more mass, but also more angular momentum. As a consequence, weaker wind models
rotate faster and show a less efficient mixing in their inner stellar
structure.
  The new tracks predict an evolution of the rotational velocities through the
MS in close agreement with the range of $\varv\sin i$ values found by recent
surveys of Galactic O-type stars. As subsequent implications, the weaker winds
from self-consistent models suggest a reduction of the contribution of the
isotope $^{26}$Al to the ISM due to stellar winds of massive stars during the
MS phase. Moreover, the higher luminosities found for the self-consistent
evolutionary models suggest that some populations of massive stars might be
less massive than previously thought, as in the case of Ofpe stars at the
Galactic Centre. Therefore, this study opens a wide range of consequences for
further research based on the evolution of massive stars.

realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) models. Existing methods mostly
take a set of high-resolution (HR) images as GTs and apply various degradations
to simulate their low-resolution (LR) counterparts. Though great progress has
been achieved, such an LR-HR pair generation scheme has several limitations.
First, the perceptual quality of HR images may not be high enough, limiting the
quality of Real-ISR outputs. Second, existing schemes do not consider much
human perception in GT generation, and the trained models tend to produce
over-smoothed results or unpleasant artifacts. With the above considerations,
we propose a human guided GT generation scheme. We first elaborately train
multiple image enhancement models to improve the perceptual quality of HR
images, and enable one LR image having multiple HR counterparts. Human subjects
are then involved to annotate the high quality regions among the enhanced HR
images as GTs, and label the regions with unpleasant artifacts as negative
samples. A human guided GT image dataset with both positive and negative
samples is then constructed, and a loss function is proposed to train the
Real-ISR models. Experiments show that the Real-ISR models trained on our

exposed to the CERN SPS 400 GeV proton beam. To provide optimal conditions for

the two core obstacles that need to be tackled when incorporating these models

the difficulty of localizing objects of unseen classes. To overcome these

prompting mitigates the whole-to-region distribution gap by prompting the

domain loss and semantic loss to exploit both domain-invariant and unique

for subsequent targeted training on neuromorphic data. Specifically, domain
loss aligns the feature space and aims to capture common features between
static and event-based images, while semantic loss emphasizes that the
differences between samples from different categories should be as large as

real Hamiltonian generally appears in $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric spinless fermion
systems where $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ indicate the inversion and

lower-dimensional band topology is trivial. Thus, the corresponding 3D band

(RHI). In sharp contrast to all the other topological insulators discovered up

due to their spike sparsity. ANN-SNN conversion is an efficient way to achieve
deep SNNs by converting well-trained Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).
However, the existing methods commonly use constant threshold for conversion,
which prevents neurons from rapidly delivering spikes to deeper layers and
causes high time delay. In addition, the same response for different inputs may
result in information loss during the information transmission. Inspired by the
biological model mechanism, we propose a multi-stage adaptive threshold (MSAT).
Specifically, for each neuron, the dynamic threshold varies with firing history
and input properties and is positively correlated with the average membrane
potential and negatively correlated with the rate of depolarization. The
self-adaptation to membrane potential and input allows a timely adjustment of
the threshold to fire spike faster and transmit more information. Moreover, we
analyze the Spikes of Inactivated Neurons error which is pervasive in early
time steps and propose spike confidence accordingly as a measurement of
confidence about the neurons that correctly deliver spikes. We use such spike
confidence in early time steps to determine whether to elicit spike to
alleviate this error. Combined with the proposed method, we examine the
performance on non-trivial datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. We also
conduct sentiment classification and speech recognition experiments on the IDBM
and Google speech commands datasets respectively. Experiments show
near-lossless and lower latency ANN-SNN conversion. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time to build a biologically inspired multi-stage
adaptive threshold for converted SNN, with comparable performance to
state-of-the-art methods while improving energy efficiency.

H-function (H(t)) to study the relaxation dynamics of a gas of molecules with
orientational degrees of freedom. We evaluate the time (t) evolution of joint
probability distribution f (p, L, t) for linear (p) and angular (L) momenta
from an initial nonequilibrium state by molecular dynamics simulations for
prolate and oblate-shaped particles. Our prolate and oblate molecules interact
with each other by two-body Gay-Berne potential. We calculate the relaxation of
the generalized H(t) with orientation from two specially prepared initial (t=0)
nonequilibrium states. In the long-time limit, the H function saturates to its
exact equilibrium value, which is the sum of translational and rotational
contributions. These, in turn, are related to respective kinetic entropies. We
find that both translational and rotational components of H(t) decay nearly
exponentially with time; the rotational component is more sensitive to the
aspect ratio. A remarkable rapid decrease in relaxation time is observed as the
spherical limit is approached, in a way tantalizingly reminiscent of
hydrodynamic predictions with slip boundary conditions. The latter is also
calculated analytically by solving the appropriate Fokker-Planck equation. We
introduce a physically motivated differential term to study the magnitude of
translation-rotation coupling. This function shows interesting dynamical
behavior at intermediate times. Overall, this study provides insights into the
relaxation dynamics of a gas of molecules with different shapes and

optimization (DRO) focus on the worst-case empirical risk to ensure low
training error on the uncommon noisy distributions. However, due to the
over-parameterized model being optimized on scarce worst-case data, DRO fails
to produce a smooth loss landscape, thus struggling on generalizing well to the

we propose SharpDRO by penalizing the sharpness of the worst-case distribution,
which measures the loss changes around the neighbor of learning parameters.
Through worst-case sharpness minimization, the proposed method successfully
produces a flat loss curve on the corrupted distributions, thus achieving
robust generalization. Moreover, by considering whether the distribution
annotation is available, we apply SharpDRO to two problem settings and design a

that SharpDRO has a great convergence guarantee. Experimentally, we simulate

representative cases. For all the cases where the weak equivalence principle is
not satisfied, tests of the violation of the weak equivalence principle provide
the tightest upper limit on the coupling constants. Upper limits from the
fifth-force experiment are always stronger than the ones from LIGO, but the
difference is less than a factor of $\sim 5$ at large-mass range. Our study
demonstrates that gravitational-wave experiments are starting to bring us
meaningful information about the nature of dark matter. The formulation
provided in this paper may be applied to the data of upcoming experiments as
well and is expected to probe much wider parameter range of the model.

  Under the proposed box-level setting, we devise a novel pipeline, namely
Complementary Pseudo Active Strategy (ComPAS). It exploits both human
annotations and the model intelligence in a complementary fashion: an efficient
input-end committee queries labels for informative objects only; meantime
well-learned targets are identified by the model and compensated with
pseudo-labels. ComPAS consistently outperforms 10 competitors under 4 settings

100% supervised performance of VOC0712 with merely 19% box annotations. On the

work investigates such predictability by studying the degree of regularity from
a specific set of user behavior data. Quantifying the predictability of Top-N

understand the stability of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) close to a fixed
point. Conventional literature relies on the convergence of statistical
moments, esp., the variance, of the parameters to quantify the stability. We
revisit the definition of stability for SGD and use the \textit{convergence in
probability} condition to define the \textit{probabilistic stability} of SGD.
The proposed stability directly answers a fundamental question in deep learning
theory: how SGD selects a meaningful solution for a neural network from an
enormous number of solutions that may overfit badly. To achieve this, we show
that only under the lens of probabilistic stability does SGD exhibit rich and
practically relevant phases of learning, such as the phases of the complete
loss of stability, incorrect learning, convergence to low-rank saddles, and
correct learning. When applied to a neural network, these phase diagrams imply
that SGD prefers low-rank saddles when the underlying gradient is noisy,
thereby improving the learning performance. This result is in sharp contrast to
the conventional wisdom that SGD prefers flatter minima to sharp ones, which we
find insufficient to explain the experimental data. We also prove that the
probabilistic stability of SGD can be quantified by the Lyapunov exponents of
the SGD dynamics, which can easily be measured in practice. Our work
potentially opens a new venue for addressing the fundamental question of how
the learning algorithm affects the learning outcome in deep learning.

curate and release a new dataset for VIE, in which the document images are much

Second, we propose to preserve the relation of each data point to the keypoints
to guide the matching. The proposed KPG-RL model can be solved by Sinkhorn's

  simulations","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2211.12922",,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With wave-particle decomposition, a unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP)
method has been developed for the multiscale flow simulations. The UGKWP method
captures the transport process in all flow regimes without kinetic solver's
constraint on the numerical mesh size and time step being less than the
particle mean free path and collision time. In the current UGKWP method, the
cell's Knudsen number, defined as the ratio of collision time to numerical time
step, is used to distribute the components in the wave-particle decomposition.
However, the adaptation of particle in UGKWP is mainly for the capturing of the
non-equilibrium transport, and the cell's Knudsen number alone is not enough to
identify the non-equilibrium state. For example, in the equilibrium flow regime
with a Maxwellian distribution function, even at a large cell's Knudsen number,
the flow evolution can be still modelled by the Navier-Stokes solver.
Therefore, to further improve the efficiency, an adaptive UGKWP (AUGKWP) method
will be developed with the introduction of an additional local flow variable
gradient-dependent Knudsen number. As a result, the wave-particle decomposition
in UGKWP will be determined by both cell's and gradient's Knudsen numbers, and
the particle in UGKWP is solely used to capture the non-equilibrium flow
transport. The AUGKWP becomes much more efficient than the previous one with
the cell's Knudsen number only in the determination of wave-particle
composition. Many numerical tests, including Sod tube, shock structure, flow
around a cylinder, flow around a reentry capsule, and an unsteady nozzle plume
flow, have been conducted to validate the accuracy and efficiency of AUGKWP.
Compared with the original UGKWP, the AUGKWP achieves the same accuracy but has
advantages in memory reduction and computational efficiency in the simulation
for the flow with the co-existing of multiple regimes.

architectures, where the optimized gates are available for some qubits but not
for others. However, such gate-level improvements limit the application of
user-side pulse-level optimizations, which have proven effective for quantum
circuits with a high level of regularity, such as the ansatz circuit of the
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). In this paper, we
investigate the trade-off between hardware-level and algorithm-level
improvements on bipotent quantum architectures. Our results for various QAOA
instances on two quantum computers offered by IBM indicate that the benefits of
pulse-level optimizations currently outweigh the improvements due to vigorously
optimized monolithic gates. Furthermore, our data indicate that the fidelity of
circuit primitives is not always the best indicator for the overall algorithm
performance; also their gate type and schedule duration should be taken into
account. This effect is particularly pronounced for QAOA on dense portfolio
optimization problems, since their transpilation requires many SWAP gates, for
which efficient pulse-level optimization exists. Our findings provide practical
guidance on optimal qubit selection on bipotent quantum architectures and
suggest the need for improvements of those architectures, ultimately making
pulse-level optimization available for all gate types.

such behaviors by pathologists in the cell detection models, mainly due to the
lack of datasets containing both cell and tissue annotations with overlapping

withstand the accumulation of the radiation induced disorder. Based on the
magnitudes of such disorder levels, semiconductors are commonly grouped into
the low- or high-radiation tolerant. Nevertheless, upon exposing to
sufficiently high fluences, in all cases known by far, it ends up with either
extremely high disorder levels or amorphization. Here we show that gamma/beta
double polymorph Ga2O3 structures exhibit unprecedently high radiation
tolerance. Specifically, for room temperature experiments, they tolerate a
disorder equivalent to hundreds of displacements per atom, without severe
degradations of crystallinity; in comparison with, e.g., Si amorphizable
already with the lattice atoms displaced just once. We explain this behavior by
an interesting combination of the Ga- and O-sublattice properties in
gamma-Ga2O3. In particular, O-sublattice exhibits a strong recrystallization
trend to recover the face-centered-cubic stacking despite high mobility of O
atoms in collision cascades compared to Ga. Concurrently, the characteristic
structure of the Ga-sublattice is nearly insensitive to the accumulated
disorder. Jointly it explains macroscopically negligible structural
deformations in gamma-Ga2O3 observed in experiment. Notably, we also explained
the origin of the beta-to-gamma Ga2O3 transformation, as a function of
increased disorder in beta-Ga2O3 and studied the phenomena as a function of the
chemical nature of the implanted atoms. As a result, we conclude that
gamma-beta double polymorph Ga2O3 structures, in terms of their radiation
tolerance properties, benchmark a new class of universal radiation tolerant
semiconductors.

  Representations",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Digital human motion synthesis is a vibrant research field with applications
in movies, AR/VR, and video games. Whereas methods were proposed to generate
natural and realistic human motions, most only focus on modeling humans and
largely ignore object movements. Generating task-oriented human-object
interaction motions in simulation is challenging. For different intents of
using the objects, humans conduct various motions, which requires the human
first to approach the objects and then make them move consistently with the
human instead of staying still. Also, to deploy in downstream applications, the
synthesized motions are desired to be flexible in length, providing options to
personalize the predicted motions for various purposes. To this end, we propose
TOHO: Task-Oriented Human-Object Interactions Generation with Implicit Neural
Representations, which generates full human-object interaction motions to
conduct specific tasks, given only the task type, the object, and a starting
human status. TOHO generates human-object motions in three steps: 1) it first
estimates the keyframe poses of conducting a task given the task type and
object information; 2) then, it infills the keyframes and generates continuous
motions; 3) finally, it applies a compact closed-form object motion estimation
to generate the object motion. Our method generates continuous motions that are
parameterized only by the temporal coordinate, which allows for upsampling or
downsampling of the sequence to arbitrary frames and adjusting the motion
speeds by designing the temporal coordinate vector. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, both qualitatively and quantitatively. This work
takes a step further toward general human-scene interaction simulation.

  Probability Distribution of Face Identification Models",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, face swapping has been developing rapidly and achieved a surprising
reality, raising concerns about fake content. As a countermeasure, various
detection approaches have been proposed and achieved promising performance.
However, most existing detectors struggle to maintain performance on unseen
face swapping methods and low-quality images. Apart from the generalization
problem, current detection approaches have been shown vulnerable to evasion
attacks crafted by detection-aware manipulators. Lack of robustness under
adversary scenarios leaves threats for applying face swapping detection in real
world. In this paper, we propose a novel face swapping detection approach based
on face identification probability distributions, coined as IdP_FSD, to improve
the generalization and robustness. IdP_FSD is specially designed for detecting
swapped faces whose identities belong to a finite set, which is meaningful in
real-world applications. Compared with previous general detection methods, we
make use of the available real faces with concerned identities and require no
fake samples for training. IdP_FSD exploits face swapping's common nature that
the identity of swapped face combines that of two faces involved in swapping.
We reflect this nature with the confusion of a face identification model and
measure the confusion with the maximum value of the output probability
distribution. What's more, to defend our detector under adversary scenarios, an
attention-based finetuning scheme is proposed for the face identification
models used in IdP_FSD. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IdP_FSD
not only achieves high detection performance on different benchmark datasets
and image qualities but also raises the bar for manipulators to evade the
detection.

Reducing this noise is a critical task called image denoising. Deep learning
has become the de facto method for image denoising, especially with the
emergence of Transformer-based models that have achieved notable
state-of-the-art results on various image tasks. However, deep learning-based
methods often suffer from a lack of generalization ability. For example, deep
models trained on Gaussian noise may perform poorly when tested on other noise
distributions. To address this issue, we present a novel approach to enhance
the generalization performance of denoising networks, known as masked training.
Our method involves masking random pixels of the input image and reconstructing
the missing information during training. We also mask out the features in the
self-attention layers to avoid the impact of training-testing inconsistency.
Our approach exhibits better generalization ability than other deep learning
models and is directly applicable to real-world scenarios. Additionally, our

with segmentation confusion adversarial training (SCAT) and contrastive
learning. SCAT plays an adversarial game between an inpainting generator and a
segmentation network, which provides pixel-level local training signals and can
adapt to images with free-form holes. By combining SCAT with standard global
adversarial training, the new adversarial training framework exhibits the
following three advantages simultaneously: (1) the global consistency of the
repaired image, (2) the local fine texture details of the repaired image, and
(3) the flexibility of handling images with free-form holes. Moreover, we
propose the textural and semantic contrastive learning losses to stabilize and
improve our inpainting model's training by exploiting the feature
representation space of the discriminator, in which the inpainting images are
pulled closer to the ground truth images but pushed farther from the corrupted
images. The proposed contrastive losses better guide the repaired images to
move from the corrupted image data points to the real image data points in the
feature representation space, resulting in more realistic completed images. We
conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating our

multiple parties to train a shared model collaboratively in a

the FL server and clients hold the same model structure. However, due to system
heterogeneity and the need for personalization, enabling clients to hold models
with diverse structures has become an important direction. Existing
model-heterogeneous FL approaches often require publicly available datasets and
incur high communication and/or computational costs, which limit their
performances. To address these limitations, we propose the Federated Global
prediction Header (FedGH) approach. It is a communication and
computation-efficient model-heterogeneous FL framework which trains a shared
generalized global prediction header with representations extracted by
heterogeneous extractors for clients' models at the FL server. The trained
generalized global prediction header learns from different clients. The
acquired global knowledge is then transferred to clients to substitute each
client's local prediction header. We derive the non-convex convergence rate of
FedGH. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that FedGH
achieves significantly more advantageous performance in both model-homogeneous

FL models, beating the best-performing baseline by up to 8.87% (for

long time been used to define and measure quality characteristics. Recently,
quality models for AI systems, based on ISO25000, have been introduced. This
paper applies one such quality model to a real-life case study: a deep learning

used very low-resolution ($4.3'$) Stokes QU data cubes of this release. We
applied rotation measure (RM) synthesis to decompose the distribution of
polarised structures in Faraday depth, and cross-correlation RM synthesis to
align different observations in Faraday depth. We stacked images of about 150
hours of the ELAIS-N1 observations to produce the deepest Faraday cube at low
radio frequencies to date, tailored to studies of Galactic synchrotron emission
and the intervening magneto-ionic interstellar medium. This Faraday cube covers
$\sim36~{\rm deg^{2}}$ of the sky and has a noise of $27~{\rm \mu
Jy~PSF^{-1}~RMSF^{-1}}$ in polarised intensity. This is an improvement in noise
by a factor of approximately the square root of the number of stacked data
cubes ($\sim\sqrt{20}$), as expected, compared to the one in a single data cube
based on five-to-eight-hour observations. We detect a faint component of
diffuse polarised emission in the stacked cube, which was not detected
previously. Additionally, we verify the reliability of the ionospheric Faraday
rotation corrections estimated from the satellite-based total electron content
measurements to be of $~\sim0.05~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$. We also demonstrate that
diffuse polarised emission itself can be used to account for the relative
ionospheric Faraday rotation corrections with respect to a reference
observation.

each learning phase with new data, the replay of samples representing all of
the previously learned knowledge in order to avoid catastrophic forgetting.
Since the amount of learned knowledge grows over time in CL problems,
generative replay spends an increasing amount of time just re-learning what is
already known. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose a replay-based CL
strategy that we term adiabatic replay (AR), which derives its efficiency from
the (reasonable) assumption that each new learning phase is adiabatic, i.e.,
represents only a small addition to existing knowledge. Each new learning phase
triggers a sampling process that selectively replays, from the body of existing
knowledge, just such samples that are similar to the new data, in contrast to
replaying all of it. Complete replay is not required since AR represents the
data distribution by GMMs, which are capable of selectively updating their
internal representation only where data statistics have changed. As long as
additions are adiabatic, the amount of to-be-replayed samples need not to
depend on the amount of previously acquired knowledge at all. We verify
experimentally that AR is superior to state-of-the-art deep generative replay
using VAEs.

to be rather featureless. The magnetic nature of the diffuse corona, and in
particular, its footpoints in the lower atmosphere, are not well understood. We
study the origin of the diffuse corona above the quiet-Sun network on
supergranular scales. We identified regions of diffuse EUV emission in the
coronal images from the SDO/AIA. To investigate their connection to the lower
atmosphere, we combined these SDO/AIA data with the transition region
spectroscopic data from the IRIS and with the underlying surface magnetic field
information from the SDO/HMI. The region of the diffuse emission is of
supergranular size and persists for more than five hours, during which it shows
no obvious substructure. It is associated with plasma at about 1 MK that is
located within and above a magnetic canopy. The canopy is formed by unipolar
magnetic footpoints that show highly structured spicule-like emission in the
overlying transition region. Our results suggest that the diffuse EUV emission
patch forms at the base of long-ranging loops, and it overlies spicular
structures in the transition region. Heated material might be supplied to it by
means of spicular upflows, conduction-driven upflows from coronal heating
events, or perhaps by flows originating from the farther footpoint. Therefore,
the question remains open how the diffuse EUV patch might be sustained.
Nevertheless, our study indicates that heated plasma trapped by long-ranging
magnetic loops might substantially contribute to the featureless ambient
coronal emission.

Chromium thiophosphate (CrPS4), an antiferromagnet, has uncompensated magnetic
spins in a single layer that make it an excellent candidate for studying
exchange bias. In this study, we examined the exchange bias in CrPS4/Fe3GeTe2
van der Waals heterostructures using anomalous Hall measurements. Our results
show that the exchange bias strength is robust for clean interfaces, with a
hysteresis loop shift of about 55 mT at 5 K for few-layer Fe3GeTe2, which is
larger than that obtained in most van der Waals AFM/FM heterostructures.
However, when exposed to air, the ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 layer develops a thin
surface oxide layer that significantly modulates the exchange bias. Remarkably,
this surface oxide layer can induce exchange bias without any field-cooling,
but merely by applying a 'preset field' from 5 K up to 140K due to the presence
of ferrimagnetic magnetite. We also observed exchange bias beyond the N\'eel
temperature of CrPS4, with two local minima due to contributions from CrPS4 and
surface oxides. These results illustrate the complex behaviour of exchange bias

warmer gas and solid-state components. We present early results from the
high-mass star formation region IRAS23385+6053. Methods: The JOYS program uses
the MIRI MRS with its IFU to investigate a sample of high- and low-mass
star-forming protostellar systems. Results: The 5 to 28mum MIRI spectrum of
IRAS23385+6053 shows a plethora of features. While the general spectrum is
typical for an embedded protostar, we see many atomic and molecular gas lines
boosted by the higher spectral resolution and sensitivity compared to previous
space missions. Furthermore, ice and dust absorption features are also present.
Here, we focus on the continuum emission, outflow tracers like the H2, [FeII]
and [NeII] lines as well as the potential accretion tracer Humphreys alpha
HI(7--6). The short-wavelength MIRI data resolve two continuum sources A and B,
where mid-infrared source A is associated with the main mm continuum peak. The
combination of mid-infrared and mm data reveals a young cluster in its making.
Combining the mid-infrared outflow tracer H2, [FeII] and [NeII] with mm SiO
data shows a complex interplay of at least three molecular outflows driven by
protostars in the forming cluster. Furthermore, the Humphreys alpha line is
detected at a 3-4sigma level towards the mid-infrared sources A and B.
Following Rigliaco et al. (2015), one can roughly estimate accretion
luminosities and corresponding accretion rates between ~2.6x10^-6 and
~0.9x10^-4 M_sun/yr. This is discussed in the context of the observed outflow
rates. Conclusions: The analysis of the MIRI MRS observations for this young
high-mass star-forming region reveals connected outflow and accretion

  Engineering (CAIN) 2023",,,,"cs.SE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Systems with artificial intelligence components, so-called AI-based systems,
have gained considerable attention recently. However, many organizations have
issues with achieving production readiness with such systems. As a means to
improve certain software quality attributes and to address frequently occurring
problems, design patterns represent proven solution blueprints. While new
patterns for AI-based systems are emerging, existing patterns have also been
adapted to this new context.
  The goal of this study is to provide an overview of design patterns for
AI-based systems, both new and adapted ones. We want to collect and categorize
patterns, and make them accessible for researchers and practitioners. To this
end, we first performed a multivocal literature review (MLR) to collect design
patterns used with AI-based systems. We then integrated the created pattern
collection into a web-based pattern repository to make the patterns browsable
and easy to find.
  As a result, we selected 51 resources (35 white and 16 gray ones), from which
we extracted 70 unique patterns used for AI-based systems. Among these are 34
new patterns and 36 traditional ones that have been adapted to this context.
Popular pattern categories include ""architecture"" (25 patterns), ""deployment""
(16), ""implementation"" (9), or ""security & safety"" (9). While some patterns
with four or more mentions already seem established, the majority of patterns
have only been mentioned once or twice (51 patterns). Our results in this
emerging field can be used by researchers as a foundation for follow-up studies
and by practitioners to discover relevant patterns for informing the design of
AI-based systems.

the field of animal behavior by enabling researchers to track the poses and
locations of freely moving animals without any marker attachment. However,
large datasets of annotated images of animals for markerless pose tracking,
especially high-resolution images taken from multiple angles with accurate 3D
annotations, are still scant. Here, we propose a method that uses a motion
capture (mo-cap) system to obtain a large amount of annotated data on animal
movement and posture (2D and 3D) in a semi-automatic manner. Our method is
novel in that it extracts the 3D positions of morphological keypoints (e.g
eyes, beak, tail) in reference to the positions of markers attached to the
animals. Using this method, we obtained, and offer here, a new dataset - 3D-POP
with approximately 300k annotated frames (4 million instances) in the form of
videos having groups of one to ten freely moving birds from 4 different camera
views in a 3.6m x 4.2m area. 3D-POP is the first dataset of flocking birds with
accurate keypoint annotations in 2D and 3D along with bounding box and
individual identities and will facilitate the development of solutions for
problems of 2D to 3D markerless pose, trajectory tracking, and identification
in birds.

it has made it possible to share millions of images and videos. However,
sending and receiving a huge amount of data is considered to be a main
challenge. To address this issue, a new algorithm is required to reduce image
bits and represent the data in a compressed form. Nevertheless, image
compression is an important application for transferring large files and
images. This requires appropriate and efficient transfers in this field to
achieve the task and reach the best results. In this work, we propose a new
algorithm based on discrete Hermite wavelets transformation (DHWT) that shows
the efficiency and quality of the color images. By compressing the color image,
this method analyzes it and divides it into approximate coefficients and detail
coefficients after adding the wavelets into MATLAB. With Multi-Resolution
Analyses (MRA), the appropriate filter is derived, and the mathematical aspects
prove to be validated by testing a new filter and performing its operation.
After the decomposition of the rows and upon the process of the reconstruction,
taking the inverse of the filter and dealing with the columns of the matrix,
the original matrix is improved by measuring the parameters of the image to
achieve the best quality of the resulting image, such as the peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), compression ratio (CR), bits per pixel (BPP), and
mean square error (MSE).

time series forecasting has become a de facto tool to make informed decisions
about the future. Most spatio-temporal forecasting models typically comprise
distinct components that learn spatial and temporal dependencies. A common
methodology employs some Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture relations
between spatial locations, while another network, such as a recurrent neural
network (RNN), learns temporal correlations. By representing every recorded
sample as its own node in a graph, rather than all measurements for a
particular location as a single node, temporal and spatial information is
encoded in a similar manner. In this setting, GNNs can now directly learn both
temporal and spatial dependencies, jointly, while also alleviating the need for
additional temporal networks. Furthermore, the framework does not require
aligned measurements along the temporal dimension, meaning that it also
naturally facilitates irregular time series, different sampling frequencies or
missing data, without the need for data imputation. To evaluate the proposed
methodology, we consider wind speed forecasting as a case study, where our
proposed framework outperformed other spatio-temporal models using GNNs with
either Transformer or LSTM networks as temporal update functions.

semidefinite (PSD) real forms in $n+1$ variables of degree $2d$ contains the
subcone $\Sigma_{n+1,2d}$ of those that are representable as finite sums of
squares (SOS) of real forms of half degree $d$. In 1888, Hilbert proved that
these cones coincide exactly in the Hilbert cases $(n+1,2d)$ with $n+1=2$ or
$2d=2$ or $(n+1,2d)=(3,4)$. To establish the strict inclusion
$\Sigma_{n+1,2d}\subsetneq\mathcal{P}_{n+1,2d}$ in any non-Hilbert case, one
can show that verifying the assertion in the basic non-Hilbert cases $(4,4)$
and $(3,6)$ suffices.
  In this paper, we construct a filtration of intermediate cones between
$\Sigma_{n+1,2d}$ and $\mathcal{P}_{n+1,2d}$. This filtration is induced via
the Gram matrix approach (by Choi, Lam and Reznick) on a filtration of
irreducible projective varieties $V_{k-n}\subsetneq \ldots \subsetneq V_n
\subsetneq \ldots \subsetneq V_0$ containing the Veronese variety. Here, $k$ is
the dimension of the vector space of real forms in $n+1$ variables of degree
$d$. By showing that $V_0,\ldots,V_n$ are varieties of minimal degree, we
demonstrate that the corresponding intermediate cones coincide with
$\Sigma_{n+1,2d}$. Likewise, for the special case when $n=2$, $V_{n+1}$ is also
a variety of minimal degree and the corresponding intermediate cone also
coincides with $\Sigma_{n+1,2d}$. We moreover prove that, in the non-Hilbert
cases of $(n+1)$-ary quartics for $n\geq 3$ and $(n+1)$-ary sextics for $n\geq
2$, all the remaining cone inclusions are strict.

value, while formally a lower limit, is likely close to the true J-factor value
for Sgr. It implies a DM cross-section incompatibly large in comparison with
existing constraints would be required to attribute recently observed
$\gamma$-ray emission from Sgr (Crocker, Macias et al. 2022; arXiv:2204.12054)
to DM annihilation. We also calculate a J-factor value using an NFW profile
fitted to the simulated DM density distribution to facilitate comparison with
past studies. This NFW J-factor value supports the conclusion that most past
studies have overestimated the dark matter density of Sgr on small scales.
This, together with the fact that the Sgr has recently been shown to emit
$\gamma$-rays of astrophysical origin, complicate the use of Sgr in indirect DM
detection searches.

computing tasks against classical computers. Noisy intermediate-scale quantum
(NISQ) devices, which have tens to hundreds of noisy physical qubits, are
gradually becoming available, but it is still challenging to achieve useful
quantum advantages in meaningful tasks at this moment. On the other hand, the
full fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) based on the quantum error
correction (QEC) code remains far beyond realization due to its extremely large
requirement of high-precision physical qubits. In this study, we propose a
quantum computing architecture to close the gap between NISQ and FTQC. Our
architecture is based on erroneous arbitrary rotation gates and error-corrected
Clifford gates implemented by lattice surgery. We omit the typical distillation
protocol to achieve direct analog rotations and small qubit requirements, and
minimize the remnant errors of the rotations by a carefully-designed state
injection protocol. Our estimation based on numerical simulations shows that,
for early-FTQC devices that consist of $10^4$ physical qubits with physical
error probability $p = 10^{-4}$, we can perform roughly $1.72 \times 10^7$
Clifford operations and $3.75 \times 10^4$ arbitrary rotations on 64 logical
qubits. Such computations cannot be realized by the existing NISQ and FTQC
architectures on the same device, as well as classical computers. We hope that
our proposal and the corresponding development of quantum algorithms based on

  comments always welcome",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Rotation period measurements of low-mass stars show that the spin
distributions in young clusters do not exhibit the spin-up expected due to
contraction, during the phase when a large fraction of stars are still
surrounded by accretion discs. During this stage, the stars accrete mass and
angular momentum and may experience accretion enhanced-magnetised winds. At the
same time, the accretion of mass and energy has a significant impact on the
evolution of stellar structure and moment of inertia. We compute evolution
models of accreting very young stars and determine, in a self-consistent way,
the effect of accretion on stellar structure and the angular momentum exchanges
between the stars and their disc. We then vary the deuterium content, the
accretion history, the entropy content of the accreted material, and the
magnetic field as well as the efficiency of the accretion-enhanced winds. It
comes that the models are driven alternatively both by the evolution of the
momentum of inertia, and by the star-disc interaction torques. Of all the
parameters we tested, the magnetic field strength, the accretion history and
the Deuterium content have the largest impact. The injection of heat only plays
a major role early in the evolution. This work demonstrates the importance of
the moment of inertia's evolution under the influence of accretion to explain
the constant rotation rates distributions that are observed over the star-disc
interactions. When accounting for rotation, the models computed with an
up-to-date torque along with a consistent structural evolution of the accreting
star are able to explain the almost constant spin evolution for the whole range
of parameter we investigated, albeit only reproducing a narrow range around the
median of the observed spin rate distributions.

provide a direct comparison among similar products or services. The
price-displaying feature not only influences the consumers' decisions, but also
affects the advertisers' bidding behaviors. In this paper, we study ad auctions
with display prices from the perspective of mechanism design, in which
advertisers are asked to submit both the costs and prices of their products. We
provide a characterization for all incentive compatible auctions with display
prices, and use it to design auctions under two scenarios. In the former
scenario, the display prices are assumed to be exogenously determined. For this
setting, we derive the welfare-maximizing and revenue-maximizing auctions for
any realization of the price profile. In the latter, advertisers are allowed to
strategize display prices in their own interests. We investigate two families
of allocation policies within the scenario and identify the equilibrium prices
accordingly. Our results reveal that the display prices do affect the design of
ad auctions and the platform can leverage such information to optimize the
performance of ad delivery.

to new classes in each learning session and must be updated incrementally.
Methods approaching this problem have updated both the classification head and
the feature extractor body at each session of CIL. In this work, we develop a
baseline method, First Session Adaptation (FSA), that sheds light on the
efficacy of existing CIL approaches and allows us to assess the relative
performance contributions from head and body adaption. FSA adapts a pre-trained
neural network body only on the first learning session and fixes it thereafter;
a head based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), is then placed on top of
the adapted body, allowing exact updates through CIL. FSA is replay-free
i.e.~it does not memorize examples from previous sessions of continual
learning. To empirically motivate FSA, we first consider a diverse selection of
22 image-classification datasets, evaluating different heads and body
adaptation techniques in high/low-shot offline settings. We find that the LDA
head performs well and supports CIL out-of-the-box. We also find that
Featurewise Layer Modulation (FiLM) adapters are highly effective in the
few-shot setting, and full-body adaption in the high-shot setting. Second, we
empirically investigate various CIL settings including high-shot CIL and
few-shot CIL, including settings that have previously been used in the
literature. We show that FSA significantly improves over the state-of-the-art
in 15 of the 16 settings considered. FSA with FiLM adapters is especially
performant in the few-shot setting. These results indicate that current
approaches to continuous body adaptation are not working as expected. Finally,
we propose a measure that can be applied to a set of unlabelled inputs which is

grid system. However, the detection alone is not enough since energy thefts can
crucially affect the electricity supply leading to some blackouts. Moreover,
privacy is one of the major challenges that must be preserved when dealing with
clients' energy data. This is often overlooked in energy theft detection
research as most current detection techniques rely on raw, unencrypted data,
which may potentially expose sensitive and personal data. To solve this issue,
we present a privacy-preserving energy theft detection technique with effective
demand management that employs two layers of privacy protection. We explore a
split learning mechanism that trains a detection model in a decentralised
fashion without the need to exchange raw data. We also employ a second layer of
privacy by the use of a masking scheme to mask clients' outputs in order to
prevent inference attacks. A privacy-enhanced version of this mechanism also
employs an additional layer of privacy protection by training a randomisation
layer at the end of the client-side model. This is done to make the output as
random as possible without compromising the detection performance. For the
energy theft detection part, we design a multi-output machine learning model to
identify energy thefts, estimate their volume, and effectively predict future
demand. Finally, we use a comprehensive set of experiments to test our proposed
scheme. The experimental results show that our scheme achieves high detection
accuracy and greatly improves the privacy preservation degree.

chain of six distinct knots in a roughly S-shaped pattern, and by comparing
them with HST images we estimated proper motions in the redshifted knots of 9.5
mas yr$^{-1}$ with an inclination angle of $73^{\circ}$, though these
quantities could not be measured for the blueshifted lobe. Analysis of the
[FeII] and [NiII] lines suggests jet densities on the order of $\sim 10^5$
cm$^{-3}$. We propose that the observed S-shaped morphology originates from a
jet launched by a smaller source with $M_\star < 0.2$ M$_{\odot}$ in orbital
motion around a larger companion of $M_\star \simeq 0.5$ M$_{\odot}$ at a
separation of 30-40 au. The measured luminosities of the knots using the
[OI]$\lambda6300$ and [SII]$\lambda6731$ lines were used to estimate a lower
limit to the mass-loss rate in the jet of $1.3 \times 10^{-11}$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$ and an upper limit of $10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is
typical for low-mass driving sources. While the brightness asymmetry between
the redshifted and blueshifted lobes is consistent with external irradiation,
further analysis of the [NiII] and [FeII] lines suggests that photoionization
of the jet is not likely to be a dominant factor, and that the emission is
dominated by collisional excitation. The dynamical age of the jet compared to
the anticipated survival time of the proplyd demonstrates that photoevaporation
of the proplyd occurred prior to jet launching, and that this is still an
active source. These two points suggest that the envelope of the proplyd may
shield the jet from the majority of external radiation, and that
photoionization of the proplyd does not appear to impact the ability of a star
to launch a jet.

to perform poorly on predicting predicates that are less represented due to the
inherent biased distribution in the training data. In this paper, we take a
closer look at the predicates and identify that most visual relations (e.g.
sit_above) involve both actional pattern (sit) and spatial pattern (above),
while the distribution bias is much less severe at the pattern level. Based on
this insight, we propose a decoupled label learning (DLL) paradigm to address
the intractable visual relation prediction from the pattern-level perspective.
Specifically, DLL decouples the predicate labels and adopts separate
classifiers to learn actional and spatial patterns respectively. The patterns
are then combined and mapped back to the predicate. Moreover, we propose a
knowledge-level label decoupling method to transfer non-target knowledge from
head predicates to tail predicates within the same pattern to calibrate the
distribution of tail classes. We validate the effectiveness of DLL on the
commonly used VidSGG benchmark, i.e. VidVRD. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that the DLL offers a remarkably simple but highly effective solution to the
long-tailed problem, achieving the state-of-the-art VidSGG performance.

Networks (DNNs) when presented with clean samples versus poisoned samples. Our
analysis shows significant disparities in frequency sensitivity between these
two types of samples. Building on these findings, we propose FREAK, a
frequency-based poisoned sample detection algorithm that is simple yet
effective. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of FREAK not only
against frequency backdoor attacks but also against some spatial attacks. Our
work is just the first step in leveraging these insights. We believe that our
analysis and proposed defense mechanism will provide a foundation for future
research and development of backdoor defenses.

  Transformation","13 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge distillation is a popular technique for transferring the knowledge
from a large teacher model to a smaller student model by mimicking. However,
distillation by directly aligning the feature maps between teacher and student
may enforce overly strict constraints on the student thus degrade the
performance of the student model. To alleviate the above feature misalignment
issue, existing works mainly focus on spatially aligning the feature maps of
the teacher and the student, with pixel-wise transformation. In this paper, we
newly find that aligning the feature maps between teacher and student along the
channel-wise dimension is also effective for addressing the feature
misalignment issue. Specifically, we propose a learnable nonlinear channel-wise
transformation to align the features of the student and the teacher model.
Based on it, we further propose a simple and generic framework for feature
distillation, with only one hyper-parameter to balance the distillation loss
and the task specific loss. Extensive experimental results show that our method
achieves significant performance improvements in various computer vision tasks
including image classification (+3.28% top-1 accuracy for MobileNetV1 on
ImageNet-1K), object detection (+3.9% bbox mAP for ResNet50-based Faster-RCNN
on MS COCO), instance segmentation (+2.8% Mask mAP for ResNet50-based
Mask-RCNN), and semantic segmentation (+4.66% mIoU for ResNet18-based PSPNet in
semantic segmentation on Cityscapes), which demonstrates the effectiveness and
the versatility of the proposed method. The code will be made publicly
available.

decades, while Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) promises to satisfy
the essential need of autonomous vehicle control in a wireless connected

the relative contributions of individual agents belongs to one of the most
fundamental problems. However, the environment volatility due to vehicle
movement and wireless disturbance could significantly shape time-varying
topological relationships among agents, thus making the Value Decomposition
(VD) challenging. Therefore, in order to cope with this annoying volatility, it
becomes imperative to design a dynamic VD framework. Hence, in this paper, we
propose a novel Stochastic VMIX (SVMIX) methodology by taking account of
dynamic topological features during the VD and incorporating the corresponding
components into a multi-agent actor-critic architecture. In particular,
Stochastic Graph Neural Network (SGNN) is leveraged to effectively capture
underlying dynamics in topological features and improve the flexibility of VD
against the environment volatility. Finally, the superiority of SVMIX is
verified through extensive simulations.

engineering practices are required to ensure the quality of the resulting
system and to improve the development process. While several practices have
already been proposed for the development of AI-based systems, detailed
practical experiences of applying these practices are rare.
  In this paper, we aim to address this gap by collecting such experiences
during a case study, namely the development of an autonomous stock trading
system that uses machine learning functionality to invest in stocks. We
selected 10 AI engineering practices from the literature and systematically
applied them during development, with the goal to collect evidence about their
applicability and effectiveness. Using structured field notes, we documented
our experiences. Furthermore, we also used field notes to document challenges
that occurred during the development, and the solutions we applied to overcome
them. Afterwards, we analyzed the collected field notes, and evaluated how each
practice improved the development. Lastly, we compared our evidence with
existing literature.
  Most applied practices improved our system, albeit to varying extent, and we
were able to overcome all major challenges. The qualitative results provide
detailed accounts about 10 AI engineering practices, as well as challenges and
solutions associated with such a project. Our experiences therefore enrich the
emerging body of evidence in this field, which may be especially helpful for
practitioner teams new to AI engineering.

that prompts with higher bias always lead to unsatisfactory predictive quality.
Based on this observation, we propose a novel search strategy based on the
greedy search to identify the near-optimal prompt for improving the performance

imposed on the heterogenous quantile regression models so that the number of
nonparametric functional coefficients to be estimated can be reduced
considerably. With the preliminary local linear quantile estimates of the
subject-specific functional coefficients, a classic agglomerative clustering
algorithm is used to estimate the unknown group structure and an

The estimated group number and structure are shown to be consistent.
Furthermore, a post-grouping local linear smoothing method is introduced to
estimate the group-specific functional coefficients, and the relevant
asymptotic normal distribution theory is derived with a normalisation rate
comparable to that in the literature. The developed methodologies and theory

have shown promising results in generating high-quality images. How applicable
these synthetic images are for FSOD tasks remains under-explored. This work
extensively studies how synthetic images generated from state-of-the-art
text-to-image generators benefit FSOD tasks. We focus on two perspectives: (1)
How to use synthetic data for FSOD? (2) How to find representative samples from
the large-scale synthetic dataset? We design a copy-paste-based pipeline for
using synthetic data. Specifically, saliency object detection is applied to the
original generated image, and the minimum enclosing box is used for cropping
the main object based on the saliency map. After that, the cropped object is
randomly pasted on the image, which comes from the base dataset. We also study
the influence of the input text of text-to-image generator and the number of
synthetic images used. To construct a representative synthetic training
dataset, we maximize the diversity of the selected images via a sample-based
and cluster-based method. However, the severe problem of high false positives
(FP) ratio of novel categories in FSOD can not be solved by using synthetic
data. We propose integrating CLIP, a zero-shot recognition model, into the FSOD
pipeline, which can filter 90% of FP by defining a threshold for the similarity
score between the detected object and the text of the predicted category.
Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO validate the effectiveness of
our method, in which performance gain is up to 21.9% compared to the few-shot

workers, hence transforming them into erasures. For $s$ malicious workers, our
solution can reduce the replication to $s+1$ instead of $2s+1$ for each partial
gradient at the expense of only $s$ additional computations at the main node
and additional rounds of light communication between the main node and the
workers. We give fundamental limits of the general framework for fractional
repetition data allocation. Our scheme is optimal in terms of replication and

the size of the dataset, a multiplicative factor away from the derived bound.

  Scene Stylization","CVPR 2023, Highlight",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent advances in 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis have
witnessed the rise of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). Nevertheless, it is not
trivial to exploit NeRF for the photorealistic 3D scene stylization task, which
aims to generate visually consistent and photorealistic stylized scenes from
novel views. Simply coupling NeRF with photorealistic style transfer (PST) will
result in cross-view inconsistency and degradation of stylized view syntheses.
Through a thorough analysis, we demonstrate that this non-trivial task can be
simplified in a new light: When transforming the appearance representation of a
pre-trained NeRF with Lipschitz mapping, the consistency and photorealism
across source views will be seamlessly encoded into the syntheses. That
motivates us to build a concise and flexible learning framework namely LipRF,
which upgrades arbitrary 2D PST methods with Lipschitz mapping tailored for the
3D scene. Technically, LipRF first pre-trains a radiance field to reconstruct
the 3D scene, and then emulates the style on each view by 2D PST as the prior
to learn a Lipschitz network to stylize the pre-trained appearance. In view of
that Lipschitz condition highly impacts the expressivity of the neural network,
we devise an adaptive regularization to balance the reconstruction and
stylization. A gradual gradient aggregation strategy is further introduced to
optimize LipRF in a cost-efficient manner. We conduct extensive experiments to
show the high quality and robust performance of LipRF on both photorealistic 3D
stylization and object appearance editing.

framework, where a visually-prompted language model is learned to generate
diverse fine-grained predicates in a low-resource way. The proposed CaCao can
be applied in a plug-and-play fashion and automatically strengthen existing SGG
to tackle the long-tailed problem. Based on that, we further introduce a novel
Entangled cross-modal prompt approach for open-world predicate scene graph
generation (Epic), where models can generalize to unseen predicates in a
zero-shot manner. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show
that CaCao consistently boosts the performance of multiple scene graph

competitive performance on open-world predicate prediction.

the distance between human heat sources is varied which shapes novel patterns
of disease transmission: For sufficiently large distance, individual buoyant

models greatly improves the feature representation ability of the model. In
particular, the multi-head mechanism is employed in the attention, hoping to
learn speech features of more aspects in different attention subspaces. For
speech recognition of complex languages, on the one hand, a small head size
will lead to an obvious shortage of learnable aspects. On the other hand, we
need to reduce the dimension of each subspace to keep the size of the overall
feature space unchanged when we increase the number of heads, which will
significantly weaken the ability to represent the feature of each subspace.
Therefore, this paper explores how to use a small attention subspace to
represent complete speech features while ensuring many heads. In this work we
propose a novel neural network architecture, namely, pyramid multi-branch
fusion DCNN with multi-head self-attention. The proposed architecture is
inspired by Dilated Convolution Neural Networks (DCNN), it uses multiple
branches with DCNN to extract the feature of the input speech under different
receptive fields. To reduce the number of parameters, every two branches are
merged until all the branches are merged into one. Thus, its shape is like a
pyramid rotated 90 degrees. We demonstrate that on Aishell-1, a widely used
Mandarin speech dataset, our model achieves a character error rate (CER) of

systems. Counting them is usually straightforward, especially if we can assign
them a clear meaning. For example, a particle moving in three-dimensional space
has three degrees of freedom, one for each independent direction of motion.
However, for more complex systems like spinning particles or coupled harmonic
oscillators, things get more complicated since there is no longer a direct
correspondence between the degrees of freedom and the number of independent
directions in the physical space in which the system exists. This paper delves
into the intricacies of degrees of freedom in physical systems and their
relationship with configuration and phase spaces. We first establish the
well-known fact that the number of degrees of freedom is equal to the dimension
of the configuration space, but show that this is only a local description. A
global approach will reveal that this space can have non-trivial topology, and
in some cases, may not even be a manifold. By leveraging this topology, we gain
a deeper understanding of the physics. We can then use that topology to
understand the physics better as well as vice versa: intuition about the
configuration space of a physical system can be used to understand non-trivial
topological spaces better.

In contrast with the full rewriting setting, the strongly monotonic requirement

requirement on cost tuples allows us to prove the innermost version of the

are interested in creating hardware implementations where neurons and the

ANNs, there are many internal sources of noise with different properties. The
purpose of this paper is to study the peculiarities of internal noise
propagation in recurrent ANN on the example of echo state network (ESN), to
reveal ways to suppress such noises and to justify the stability of networks to
some types of noises.
  In this paper we analyse ESN in presence of uncorrelated additive and
multiplicative white Gaussian noise. Here we consider the case when artificial
neurons have linear activation function with different slope coefficients.
Starting from studying only one noisy neuron we complicate the problem by
considering how the input signal and the memory property affect the
accumulation of noise in ESN. In addition, we consider the influence of the
main types of coupling matrices on the accumulation of noise. So, as such
matrices, we take a uniform matrix and a diagonal-like matrices with different
coefficients called ""blurring"" coefficient.
  We have found that the general view of variance and signal-to-noise ratio of
ESN output signal is similar to only one neuron. The noise is less accumulated
in ESN with diagonal reservoir connection matrix with large ""blurring""
coefficient. Especially it concerns uncorrelated multiplicative noise.

order parameter with the universal balance law of internal energy. In place of
the standard Fourier form, the constitutive law of the heat flux is assumed in
the form given by the theory developed by Green and Naghdi, which accounts for
a possible thermal memory of the evolution. This has the consequence that the
balance law of internal energy becomes a second-order in time equation for the
thermal displacement or freezing index, that is, a primitive with respect to
time of the temperature. Another particular feature of our system is the
presence of the source term in the equation for the order parameter, which
entails further mathematical difficulties because the mass conservation of the
order parameter is no longer satisfied. We study the case that the double-well
potential driving the evolution of the phase transition is given by the
nondifferentiable double obstacle potential, thereby complementing recent
results obtained for the differentiable cases of regular and logarithmic
potentials. We derive first-order necessary optimality conditions for the
control problem. The analysis is carried out by employing the so-called deep
quench approximation in which the nondifferentiable double obstacle potential
is approximated by a family of logarithmic potentials for which meaningful
first-order necessary optimality conditions are available. Since the results
for the logarithmic potentials crucially depend on the validity of the
so-called strict separation property which is only available in the spatially

rendered 2D images, we retrieve relevant words from the CLIP vocabulary and
construct pseudo captions using templates. Our constructed captions provide
high-level semantic supervision for generated 3D shapes. Further, in order to
produce fine-grained textures and increase geometry diversity, we propose to
adopt low-level image regularization to enable fake-rendered images to align
with the real ones. During the inference phase, our proposed model can generate
3D textured shapes from the given text without any additional optimization. We
conduct extensive experiments to analyze each of our proposed components and
show the efficacy of our framework in generating high-fidelity 3D textured and

Here, we introduce a new element into cavity-QED - a free charged particle,

demonstrate that our approach enables ultrafast, deterministic and universal
discrete-variable quantum computation in a cavity-QED-based architecture, with
potentially improved scalability. Our proposal hinges on a novel excitation
blockade mechanism in a resonant interaction between a free-electron and a
cavity polariton. This nonlinear interaction is faster by several orders of
magnitude with respect to current photon-based cavity-QED gates, enjoys wide
tunability and can demonstrate fidelities close to unity. Furthermore, our
scheme is ubiquitous to any cavity nonlinearity, either due to light-matter
coupling as in the Jaynes-Cummings model or due to photon-photon interactions
as in a Kerr-type many-body system. In addition to promising advancements in
cavity-QED quantum computation, our approach paves the way towards ultrafast
and deterministic generation of highly-entangled photonic graph states and is
applicable to other quantum technologies involving cavity-QED.

  Stochastic Image Generation",,,,,"physics.med-ph physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Score-based stochastic denoising models have recently been demonstrated as
powerful machine learning tools for conditional and unconditional image
generation. The existing methods are based on a forward stochastic process
wherein the training images are scaled to zero over time and white noise is
gradually added such that the final time step is approximately zero-mean
identity-covariance Gaussian noise. A neural network is then trained to
approximate the time-dependent score function, or the gradient of the logarithm
of the probability density, for that time step. Using this score estimator, it
is possible to run an approximation of the time-reversed stochastic process to
sample new images from the training data distribution. These score-based
generative models have been shown to out-perform generative adversarial neural
networks using standard benchmarks and metrics. However, one issue with this
approach is that it requires a large number of forward passes of the neural
network. Additionally, the images at intermediate time steps are not useful,
since the signal-to-noise ratio is low. In this work we present a new method
called Fourier Diffusion Models which replaces the scalar operations of the
forward process with shift-invariant convolutions and the additive white noise
with additive stationary noise. This allows for control of MTF and NPS at
intermediate time steps. Additionally, the forward process can be crafted to
converge to the same MTF and NPS as the measured images. This way, we can model
continuous probability flow from true images to measurements. In this way, the
sample time can be used to control the tradeoffs between measurement
uncertainty and generative uncertainty of posterior estimates. We compare
Fourier diffusion models to existing scalar diffusion models and show that they
achieve a higher level of performance and allow for a smaller number of time
steps.

distribution consistency-based losses: self-consistency, cross-consistency, and
local contrastive. The self-consistency loss is formulated by encouraging GMMs
in Euclidean and feature spaces to share identical posterior distributions. The
cross-consistency loss derives from the fact that the points of two partially
overlapping point clouds belonging to the same clusters share the cluster
centroids. The cross-consistency loss allows the network to flexibly learn a
transformation-invariant posterior distribution of two aligned point clouds.
The local contrastive loss facilitates the network to extract discriminative
local features. Our UDPReg achieves competitive performance on the

values of curves therein, are generally used by researchers to evaluate the
predictive performance of such quality assessment algorithms. An EDC curve
depends on an error type such as the ""False Non Match Rate"" (FNMR), a quality
assessment algorithm, a biometric recognition system, a set of comparisons each
corresponding to a biometric sample pair, and a comparison score threshold
corresponding to a starting error. To compute an EDC curve, comparisons are
progressively discarded based on the associated samples' lowest quality scores,
and the error is computed for the remaining comparisons. Additionally, a
discard fraction limit or range must be selected to compute pAUC values, which
can then be used to quantitatively rank quality assessment algorithms.
  This paper discusses and analyses various details for this kind of quality

Reynolds number ($Re$) of 30 and for a range of Darcy number ($Da$) and flow
incidence ($\alpha$) values. For a plate normal to the stream and vanishing
$Da$, the wake shows a vortex dipole with negligible separation from the plate.
With increasing $Da$, the separation between the vortex dipole and the plate
increases; the vortex dipole shortens and is eventually annihilated at a
critical $Da$ between $8 \times 10^{-4}$ and $9 \times 10^{-4}$. The drag is
found to decrease monotonically with $Da$. For any value of $Da$ below the
critical one, the vortex dipole disappears with decreasing $\alpha$. However,
this occurs through different topological stages for low and high $Da$. At low
$Da$ such as $5 \times 10^{-5}$, as $\alpha$ decreases, first, one saddle-node
pair merges, forming a single recirculating region with negative circulation.
Thereafter, the second saddle-node pair merges, annihilating that region. For
high $Da$, such as $5 \times 10^{-4}$, the two saddle-node pairs merge at the
same critical incidence, $\alpha=44^\circ$. The magnitude of lift, drag, and
torque decrease with $Da$. However, there exists a range of $Da$ and $\alpha$,
where the magnitude of the plate-wise force component increases with $Da$,
driven by the shear on the plate's pressure side. The present findings will be
directly beneficial in understanding the role of permeability and solidity on

capability of deep neural networks by learning model with multiple source

of which is that diversifying source domains will be conducive to the
out-of-distribution generalization. However, these claims are understood
intuitively, rather than mathematically. Our explorations empirically reveal
that the correlation between model generalization and the diversity of domains
may be not strictly positive, which limits the effectiveness of domain
augmentation. This work therefore aim to guarantee and further enhance the
validity of this strand. To this end, we propose a new perspective on DG that
recasts it as a convex game between domains. We first encourage each
diversified domain to enhance model generalization by elaborately designing a
regularization term based on supermodularity. Meanwhile, a sample filter is
constructed to eliminate low-quality samples, thereby avoiding the impact of
potentially harmful information. Our framework presents a new avenue for the
formal analysis of DG, heuristic analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate

a linear chain of oscillators. The qubits undergo an effective open-system
dynamics in the presence of a non-Markovian reservoir, constituted by the
chain's vibrations. The model is amenable to an analytical solution when the
chain is initially in a thermal state. We study the dynamics of the qubits
concurrence starting from a separable state and assuming that the chain
spectrum is gapped. We identify three relevant regimes that depend on the
strength of the qubit-chain coupling in relation to the spectral gap. These are
(i) the weak coupling regime, where the qubits are entangled at the
asymptotics; (ii) the strong coupling regime, where the concurrence can exhibit
collapses followed by revivals with exponentially attenuated amplitude; and
(iii) the thermal damping regime, where the concurrence rapidly vanishes due to
the chain's thermal excitation. In all cases, if entanglement is generated,
this occurs after a finite time has elapsed. This time scale depends
exponentially on the qubits distance and is determined by the spectral
properties of the chain. Entanglement irreversible decay, on the other hand, is
due to the dissipative effect induced by the coupling with the chain and is
controlled by the coupling strength between the chain and qubits. This study
identifies the resources of an environment for realising quantum coherent

linear order in density perturbations, but can be produced by the post-Born
lens-lens coupling at second order. This rotation is somewhat enhanced for
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing due to the large source path length,
but remains small and very challenging to detect directly by CMB lensing
reconstruction alone. We show the rotation may be detectable at high
significance as a cross-correlation signal between the curl reconstructed with
Simons Observatory (SO) or CMB-S4 data, and a template constructed from
quadratic combinations of large-scale structure (LSS) tracers. Equivalently,
the lensing rotation-tracer-tracer bispectrum can also be detected, where LSS
tracers considered include the CMB lensing convergence, galaxy density, and the
Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB), or optimal combinations thereof. We forecast
that an optimal combination of these tracers can probe post-Born rotation at
the level of $5.7\sigma$-$6.1\sigma$ with SO and $13.6\sigma$-$14.7\sigma$ for
CMB-S4, depending on whether standard quadratic estimators or maximum a
posteriori iterative methods are deployed. We also show possible improvement up
to $21.3\sigma$ using a CMB-S4 deep patch observation with polarization-only
iterative lensing reconstruction. However, these cross-correlation signals have
non-zero bias because the rotation template is quadratic in the tracers, and
exists even if the lensing is rotation free. We estimate this bias
analytically, and test it using simple null-hypothesis simulations to confirm
that the bias remains subdominant to the rotation signal of interest. Detection

  Occlusion","8 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work presents a novel RGB-D-inertial dynamic SLAM method that can enable
accurate localisation when the majority of the camera view is occluded by
multiple dynamic objects over a long period of time. Most dynamic SLAM
approaches either remove dynamic objects as outliers when they account for a
minor proportion of the visual input, or detect dynamic objects using semantic
segmentation before camera tracking. Therefore, dynamic objects that cause
large occlusions are difficult to detect without prior information. The
remaining visual information from the static background is also not enough to
support localisation when large occlusion lasts for a long period. To overcome
these problems, our framework presents a robust visual-inertial bundle
adjustment that simultaneously tracks camera, estimates cluster-wise dense
segmentation of dynamic objects and maintains a static sparse map by combining
dense and sparse features. The experiment results demonstrate that our method
achieves promising localisation and object segmentation performance compared to
other state-of-the-art methods in the scenario of long-term large occlusion.

neoclassical model of the labor market, there are jobs for everybody and no
jobs to steal. (There is no unemployment, so anybody who wants to work can
work.) In standard matching models, there is some unemployment, but labor
demand is perfectly elastic so new entrants into the labor force are absorbed
without affecting jobseekers' prospects. Once again, no jobs are stolen when
immigrants arrive. This paper shows that in a matching model with job
rationing, in contrast, the entry of immigrants reduces the employment rate of
native workers. Moreover, the reduction in employment rate is sharper when the
labor market is depressed -- because jobs are more scarce then. Because
immigration reduces labor-market tightness, it makes it easier for firms to
recruit and improves firm profits. The overall effect of immigration on native
welfare depends on the state of the labor market. It is always negative when
the labor market is inefficiently slack, but some immigration improves welfare
when the labor market is inefficiently tight.

However, cloth properties such as its stiffness or density can highly impact
the performance of these primitives. Although existing solutions have tackled
the parameterisation of pick and place locations, the effect of factors such as
the velocity or trajectory of quasi-static and dynamic manipulation primitives
has been neglected. Choosing appropriate values for these parameters is crucial
to cope with the range of materials present in house-hold cloth objects. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Quasi-Dynamic Parameterisable (QDP)
method, which optimises parameters such as the motion velocity in addition to
the pick and place positions of quasi-static and dynamic manipulation
primitives. In this work, we leverage the framework of Sequential Reinforcement
Learning to decouple sequentially the parameters that compose the primitives.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the method we focus on the task of cloth
unfolding with a robotic arm in simulation and real-world experiments. Our
results in simulation show that by deciding the optimal parameters for the
primitives the performance can improve by 20% compared to sub-optimal ones.
Real-world results demonstrate the advantage of modifying the velocity and

its computational complexity, several optimization-based methods have been
proposed to lighten its problem formulation by removing redundant line flow
constraints. These approaches often ignore the spatial couplings of renewable
generation and demand, which have an inherent impact of market outcomes.
Moreover, the elimination procedures primarily focus on the feasible region and
exclude how the problem's objective function plays a role here. To address
these pitfalls, we move to rule out redundant and inactive constraints over a
tight linear programming relaxation of the original unit commitment feasibility
region by adding valid inequality constraints. We extend the optimization-based
approach called umbrella constraint discovery through the enforcement of a
consistency logic on the set of constraints by adding the proposed inequality
constraints to the formulation. Hence, we reduce the conservativeness of the
screening approach using the available historical data and thus lead to a
tighter unit commitment formulation. Numerical tests are performed on standard

a powerful modality in functional and anatomical assessment for various
cardiovascular diseases. Sufficient image quality is essential to achieve
proper diagnosis and treatment. A large number of medical images, the variety
of imaging artefacts, and the workload of imaging centres are among the things
that reveal the necessity of automatic image quality assessment (IQA). However,
automated IQA requires access to bulk annotated datasets for training deep
learning (DL) models. Labelling medical images is a tedious, costly and
time-consuming process, which creates a fundamental challenge in proposing
DL-based methods for medical applications. This study aims to present a new
method for CMR IQA when there is limited access to annotated datasets. Methods:
The proposed generalised deep meta-learning model can evaluate the quality by
learning tasks in the prior stage and then fine-tuning the resulting model on a
small labelled dataset of the desired tasks. This model was evaluated on the
data of over 6,000 subjects from the UK Biobank for five defined tasks,
including detecting respiratory motion, cardiac motion, Aliasing and Gibbs
ringing artefacts and images without artefacts. Results: The results of
extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed model. Besides,
comparing the model's accuracy with the domain adaptation model indicates a
significant difference by using only 64 annotated images related to the desired
tasks. Conclusion: The proposed model can identify unknown artefacts in images
with acceptable accuracy, which makes it suitable for medical applications and
quality assessment of large cohorts.

ability to capture the feature correlations. Specifically, we propose a simple

approach that uses point-to-point communication, albeit at a higher arithmetic
complexity. The new algorithm exploits tensor-matrix multiplications on a
volumetrically decomposed domain via three specially adapted variants of
Cannon's algorithm. It has here been implemented as a C++ library called S3DFT
and tested on the JUWELS Cluster at the J\""ulich Supercomputing Center. Our
implementation of the shared memory tensor-matrix multiplication attained 88\%
of the theoretical single node peak performance. One variant of the distributed
memory tensor-matrix multiplication shows excellent scaling, while the other
two show poorer performance, which can be attributed to their intrinsic
communication patterns. A comparison of S3DFT with the Intel MKL and FFTW3
libraries indicates that currently iMKL performs best overall, followed in
order by FFTW3 and S3DFT. This picture might change with further improvements
of the algorithm and/or when running on clusters that use network connections
with higher latency, e.g. on cloud platforms.

iron in the Universe, but their formation paths are still debated. Several
dozen supersoft X-ray sources, in which a white dwarf accretes hydrogen-rich
matter from a non-degenerate donor star, have been observed and suggested as
Type Ia supernovae progenitors. However, observational evidence for hydrogen,
which is expected to be stripped off the donor star during the supernova
explosion, is lacking. Helium-accreting white dwarfs, which would circumvent
this problem, have been predicted for more than 30 years, also including their
appearance as supersoft X-ray sources, but have so far escaped detection. Here
we report a supersoft X-ray source with an accretion disk whose optical
spectrum is completely dominated by helium, suggesting that the donor star is
hydrogen-free. We interpret the luminous and supersoft X-rays as due to helium
burning near the surface of the accreting white dwarf. The properties of our
system provides evidence for extended pathways towards Chandrasekhar mass
explosions based on helium accretion, in particular for stable burning in white
dwarfs at lower accretion rates than expected so far. This may allow to recover
the population of the sub-energetic so-called Type Iax supernovae, up to 30% of
all Type Ia supernovae, within this scenario.

objects (ETNOs) under the action of the External Field Effect (EFE), which is a
consequence of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) applied to gravity around the
Sun embedded in the gravitational field of the Galaxy. We perform N-body
integrations of known ETNOs treated as massless particles and perturbed by four
giant planets and EFE. Backward integrations show that these objects originated
in the giant planet region, from where they were scattered and then evolved to
their current orbits. A striking example of such evolution is Sedna, which may
have been temporarily in a horseshoe orbit with Jupiter and Saturn only
$30$~Myr ago. Another interesting example is the newly discovered retrograde
ETNOs, whose dynamical connection with prograde ETNOs and Centaurs is shown.
The EFE is considered as an alternative to Planet Nine in explaining the
anomalous distribution of ETNO orbits, namely the orbital plane clustering and
apsidal confinement. We also analyse the effect of MOND on the obliquity of the
solar spin with respect to the invariant plane of the solar system. Finally, we
discuss the significance of trans-Neptunian solar system in the context of the

is suppressed at small angles $\Theta\lesssim M_Q/E$ for mass $M_Q$ and high
energy $E$ according to perturbative Quantum Chromo Dynamics (QCD) (``dead cone
effect''). As particles at small angles typically have large momenta, the heavy
quark mass also causes a suppression of high momentum particles. In this paper,
we studied this effect in c- and b-quark events using data from Z boson decays
in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. The heavy quark fragmentation function for charged
particles is reconstructed in the momentum fraction variable $x$ or
$\xi=\ln(1/x)$ by removing the decays of the heavy quark hadrons. Indeed, we
find an increasing suppression of particles with rising $x$ down to a fraction
of $\lesssim 1/10$ for particles with $x\gtrsim0.2$ in b-quark and
$x\gtrsim0.4$ in c-quark jets in comparison to light quark fragmentation. The
sensitivity to the dead cone effect in the present momentum analysis is
considerably increased in comparison to the recently presented angular
analysis. This amount of suppression and the differences between c- and b-quark
fragmentation are in good quantitative agreement with the expectations based on
perturbative QCD within the Modified Leading Logarithmic Approximation (MLLA)
in the central kinematic region. The data also support a two parameter
description in the MLLA of these phenomena (``Limiting Spectrum''). The

  minimization",,,,,"math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Subspace minimization conjugate gradient (SMCG) methods have become a class
of quite efficient iterative methods for unconstrained optimization and have
attracted extensive attention recently. Usually, the search directions of SMCG
methods are generated by minimizing approximate models with the approximation
matrix $ B_k $ of the objective function at the current iterate over the
subspace spanned by the current gradient $ g_k $ and the latest search
direction. The $ g_k^TB_kg_k $ must be estimated properly in the calculation of
the search directions, which is crucial to the theoretical properties and the
numerical performance of SMCG methods. It is a great challenge to estimate it
properly. The projection technique has been used successfully to generate
conjugate gradient directions such as Dai-Kou conjugate gradient direction.
Motivated by the above two observations, in the paper we present a new subspace
minimization conjugate gradient methods by using a projection technique based
on the memoryless quasi-Newton method. More specially, we project the search
direction of the memoryless quasi-Newton method into the subspace spanned by
the current gradient and the latest search direction and drive a new search
direction, which is proved to be descent. Remarkably, the proposed method
without any line search enjoys the finite termination property for two
dimensional convex quadratic functions, which is helpful for designing
algorithm. An adaptive scaling factor in the search direction is given based on
the above finite termination property. The proposed method does not need to
determine the parameter $ \rho_k $ and can be regarded as an extension of
Dai-Kou conjugate gradient method. The global convergence of the proposed
method is analyzed. Numerical comparisons indicate the proposed method is very
promising.

these low transverse momenta enhance the sensitivity to quark$-$gluon plasma

energy loss in the QGP shows that the observed narrowing of the Pb$-$Pb
distribution relative to pp can be explained if quark-initiated jets are more
likely to emerge from the medium than gluon-initiated jets. These new
measurements discard intra-jet $p_{\rm T}$ broadening as described in a model
calculation with the BDMPS formalism as the main mechanism of energy loss in

resolve two independent splittings, favoring mechanisms that incorporate

our motivation is to allow the robot to reason over and consider non-prehensile
rearrangement actions that lead to complex robot-object and object-object
interactions where multiple objects might be moved by the robot simultaneously,
and objects might tilt, lean on each other, or topple. To support this, we
query a physics-based simulator to forward simulate these interaction dynamics

To make the planner tractable, we establish a connection between the domain of
Manipulation Among Movable Objects and Multi-Agent Pathfinding that lets us
decompose the problem into two phases our M4M algorithm iterates over. First we
solve a multi-agent planning problem that reasons about the configurations of
movable objects but does not forward simulate a physics model. Next, an arm
motion planning problem is solved that uses a physics-based simulator but does
not search over possible configurations of movable objects. We run simulated

\right | < 0.9$) and forward rapidity (2.5 $< y <$ 4) in Pb$-$Pb collisions at
$\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV with the ALICE detector at the LHC are
reported. The inclusive J/$\psi$ production yields and nuclear modification
factors, $R_{\rm AA}$, are measured as a function of the collision centrality,
J/$\psi$ transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$), and rapidity. The J/$\psi$ average
transverse momentum and squared transverse momentum ($\langle
p_{\mathrm{T}}\rangle$ and $\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{2}}\rangle$) are
evaluated as a function of the centrality at midrapidity. Compared to the
previous ALICE publications, here the entire Pb$-$Pb collisions dataset
collected during the LHC Run 2 is used, which improves the precision of the
measurements and extends the $p_{\rm T}$ coverage. The $p_{\rm T}$-integrated
$R_{\rm AA}$ shows a hint of an increasing trend towards unity from semicentral
to central collisions at midrapidity, while it is flat at forward rapidity. The
$p_{\rm T}$-differential $R_{\rm AA}$ shows a strong suppression at high
$p_{\rm T}$ with less suppression at low $p_{\rm T}$ where it reaches a larger
value at midrapidity compared to forward rapidity. The ratio of the $p_{\rm
T}$-integrated yields of J/$\psi$ to those of D$^{0}$ mesons is reported for
the first time for the central and semicentral event classes at midrapidity.
Model calculations implementing charmonium production via the coalescence of
charm quarks and antiquarks during the fireball evolution (transport models) or
in a statistical approach with thermal weights are in good agreement with the
data at low $p_{\rm T}$. At higher $p_{\rm T}$, the data are well described by
transport models and a model based on energy loss in the strongly-interacting
medium produced in nuclear collisions at the LHC.

with distributed clients while not uploading their local data, which attracts
increasing attention in both academia and industry. However, there is still a
considerable gap between the flourishing FL research and real-world scenarios,
mainly caused by the characteristics of heterogeneous devices and its scales.
Most existing works conduct evaluations with homogeneous devices, which are
mismatched with the diversity and variability of heterogeneous devices in
real-world scenarios. Moreover, it is challenging to conduct research and
development at scale with heterogeneous devices due to limited resources and
complex software stacks. These two key factors are important yet underexplored
in FL research as they directly impact the FL training dynamics and final
performance, making the effectiveness and usability of FL algorithms unclear.
To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable
prototyping system for real-world cross-device FL, FS-Real. It supports
heterogeneous device runtime, contains parallelism and robustness enhanced FL
server, and provides implementations and extensibility for advanced FL utility
features such as personalization, communication compression and asynchronous
aggregation. To demonstrate the usability and efficiency of FS-Real, we conduct
extensive experiments with various device distributions, quantify and analyze
the effect of the heterogeneous device and various scales, and further provide
insights and open discussions about real-world FL scenarios. Our system is
released to help to pave the way for further real-world FL research and broad
applications involving diverse devices and scales.

shown great potential in image-text matching. Generally, recent approaches
first employ a cross-modal attention unit to capture latent region-word

aggregation strategies with complex architectures or additional information,
while ignoring the regulation ability of network feedback. In this paper, we
develop two simple but quite effective regulators which efficiently encode the
message output to automatically contextualize and aggregate cross-modal

Regulator (RCR) which facilitates the cross-modal attention unit progressively
with adaptive attention factors to capture more flexible correspondence, and
(ii) a Recurrent Aggregation Regulator (RAR) which adjusts the aggregation
weights repeatedly to increasingly emphasize important alignments and dilute
unimportant ones. Besides, it is interesting that RCR and RAR are
plug-and-play: both of them can be incorporated into many frameworks based on
cross-modal interaction to obtain significant benefits, and their cooperation
achieves further improvements. Extensive experiments on MSCOCO and Flickr30K

  Emitting Radiation, Chemicals or Scents",,,,,"cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adversarial search of a network for an immobile Hider (or target) was
introduced and solved for rooted trees by Gal (1979). In this zero-sum game, a
Hider picks a point to hide on the tree and a Searcher picks a unit speed
trajectory starting at the root. The payoff (to the Hider) is the search time.
In Gal's model (and many subsequent investigations), the Searcher receives no
additional information after the Hider chooses his location. In reality, the
Searcher will often receive such locational information. For homeland security,
mobile sensors on vehicles have been used to locate radioactive material
stashed in an urban environment. In a military setting, mobile sensors can
detect chemical signatures from land mines. In predator-prey search, the
predator often has specially attuned senses (hearing for wolves, vision for
eagles, smell for dogs, sonar for bats, pressure sensors for sharks) that may
help it locate the prey. How can such noisy locational information be used by
the Searcher to modify her route? We model such information as signals which
indicate which of two branches of a binary tree should be searched first, where
the signal has a known accuracy p<1. Our solution calculates which branch (at
every branch node) is favored, meaning it should always be searched first when
the signal is in that direction. When the signal is in the other direction, we
calculate the probability the signal should be followed. Compared to the
optimal Hider strategy in the classic search game of Gal, the Hider's optimal
distribution for this model is more skewed towards leaf nodes that are further
from the root.

utilises a nonprehensile push planner to compute actions for how the robot

whether the actions satisfy physics constraints encoded in the problem.
However, M4M greedily commits to valid pushes found during planning, and does
not reason about orderings over pushes if multiple objects need to be

extend M4M and present Enhanced-M4M (E-M4M) -- a systematic graph search-based

by leveraging their nearest neighbours' information. The neighbours are
identified as the training proceeds using an online clustering approach
operating in an embedding space trained via a prototypical loss to encourage
well-formed clusters. The online nature of ProtoCon allows it to utilise the
label history of the entire dataset in one training cycle to refine labels in
the following cycle without the need to store image embeddings. Hence, it can
seamlessly scale to larger datasets at a low cost. Finally, ProtoCon addresses
the poor training signal in the initial phase of training (due to fewer

near-far disparity phenomenon of monocular vision and the ever-changing camera
pose, it is hard to acquire high detection accuracy, especially for far
objects. Inspired by the insight that the depth of an object can be well
determined according to the depth of the ground where it stands, in this paper,
we propose a novel Mono3D framework, called MoGDE, which constantly estimates
the corresponding ground depth of an image and then utilizes the estimated
ground depth information to guide Mono3D. To this end, we utilize a pose
detection network to estimate the pose of the camera and then construct a
feature map portraying pixel-level ground depth according to the 3D-to-2D
perspective geometry. Moreover, to improve Mono3D with the estimated ground
depth, we design an RGB-D feature fusion network based on the transformer
structure, where the long-range self-attention mechanism is utilized to
effectively identify ground-contacting points and pin the corresponding ground
depth to the image feature map. We conduct extensive experiments on the
real-world KITTI dataset. The results demonstrate that MoGDE can effectively
improve the Mono3D accuracy and robustness for both near and far objects. MoGDE
yields the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods by a

complex interactions between biological and chemical objects. Recently in the
literature, the PharmKG dataset has been proposed as one of the most

connection between $V$ and $\Lambda$ within a scenario of space-time metric, we
will use a model of spherical universe with Hubble radius $R_H$ filled by a low
vacuum energy density $\rho_{\Lambda}$ that governs the accelerated expansion
of the universe. In doing this, we will show that SSR-metric plays the role of

GMMs, the current PISL incorporates two a priori physical conditions, namely,
distance and amplitude saturation. GMMs developed using the PISL, an empirical
regression method (ERM), and an artificial neural network (ANN) are compared in
terms of residuals and extrapolation based on obtained data of peak ground
acceleration and velocity. The results show that the inter- and intra-event
standard deviations of the three methods are similar. The functional form of
the PISL is more concise than that of the ERM and ANN. The extrapolation
capability of the PISL is more accurate than that of the ANN. The PISL-GMM used
in this study provide a new paradigm of regression that considers both physical
and data-driven machine learning and can be used to identify the implied
physical relationships and prediction equations of ground motion variables in
different regions.

multi-agent systems (MASs) against Byzantine attacks. The agent affected by
Byzantine attacks sends different wrong values to all neighbors while applying
wrong input signals for itself, which is aggressive and difficult to be
defended. Inspired by the concept of Digital Twin, a new hierarchical protocol
equipped with a virtual twin layer (TL) is proposed, which decouples the above
problems into the defense scheme against Byzantine edge attacks on the TL and
the defense scheme against Byzantine node attacks on the cyber-physical layer
(CPL). On the TL, we propose a resilient topology reconfiguration strategy by
adding a minimum number of key edges to improve network resilience. It is
strictly proved that the control strategy is sufficient to achieve asymptotic
consensus in finite time with the topology on the TL satisfying strongly
$(2f+1)$-robustness. On the CPL, decentralized chattering-free controllers are
proposed to guarantee the resilient output consensus for the heterogeneous MASs
against Byzantine node attacks. Moreover, the obtained controller shows
exponential convergence. The effectiveness and practicality of the theoretical
results are verified by numerical examples.

relationships among macroeconomic variables. Moreover, we implement an ablation
study based on the output of the interpretations to improve the predictive
accuracy of the models. Our empirical results show that crude oil, as Canada's
main commodity export, is the leading factor that determines the exchange rate
dynamics with time-varying effects. The changes in the sign and magnitude of
the contributions of crude oil to the exchange rate are consistent with
significant events in the commodity and energy markets and the evolution of the
crude oil trend in Canada. Gold and the TSX stock index are found to be the
second and third most important variables that influence the exchange rate.
Accordingly, this analysis provides trustworthy and practical insights for
policymakers and economists and accurate knowledge about the predictive model's
decisions, which are supported by theoretical considerations.

limit of attack magnitude that can be tolerated by the network is calculated by
the corresponding theory, and it is proved that the above geometric programming

Yu","Web3: The Next Internet Revolution","Preprint. 5 figures, 2 tables",,,,"cs.CY cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the first appearance of the World Wide Web, people more rely on the Web
for their cyber social activities. The second phase of World Wide Web, named
Web 2.0, has been extensively attracting worldwide people that participate in
building and enjoying the virtual world. Nowadays, the next internet
revolution: Web3 is going to open new opportunities for traditional social
models. The decentralization property of Web3 is capable of breaking the
monopoly of the internet companies. Moreover, Web3 will lead a paradigm shift
from the Web as a publishing medium to a medium of interaction and
participation. This change will deeply transform the relations among users and
platforms, forces and relations of production, and the global economy.
Therefore, it is necessary that we technically, practically, and more broadly
take an overview of Web3. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of
Web3, with a focus on current technologies, challenges, opportunities, and
outlook. This article first introduces several major technologies of Web3.
Then, we illustrate the type of Web3 applications in detail. Blockchain and
smart contracts ensure that decentralized organizations will be less trusted
and more truthful than that centralized organizations. Decentralized finance
will be global, and open with financial inclusiveness for unbanked people. This
paper also discusses the relationship between the Metaverse and Web3, as well
as the differences and similarities between Web 3.0 and Web3. Inspired by the
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, we further conduct a novel hierarchy of
needs theory within Web3. Finally, several worthwhile future research
directions of Web3 are discussed.

  conducted in 2020-2021 during an ARPE

or local field potentials are obtained from multiple sensors. They can be
decoded by machine learning models in order to estimate the ongoing brain state
of a patient or healthy user. In a brain-computer interface (BCI), this decoded
brain state information can be used with minimal time delay to either control
an application, e.g., for communication or for rehabilitation after stroke, or
to passively monitor the ongoing brain state of the subject, e.g., in a
demanding work environment. A specific challenge in such decoding tasks is
posed by the small dataset sizes in BCI compared to other domains of machine
learning like computer vision or natural language processing. A possibility to
tackle classification or regression problems in BCI despite small training data
sets is through transfer learning, which utilizes data from other sessions,
subjects or even datasets to train a model. In this exploratory study, we
propose novel domain-specific embeddings for neurophysiological data. Our
approach is based on metric learning and builds upon the recently proposed
ladder loss. Using embeddings allowed us to benefit, both from the good
generalisation abilities and robustness of deep learning and from the fast
training of classical machine learning models for subject-specific calibration.
In offline analyses using EEG data of 14 subjects, we tested the embeddings'
feasibility and compared their efficiency with state-of-the-art deep learning
models and conventional machine learning pipelines. In summary, we propose the
use of metric learning to obtain pre-trained embeddings of EEG-BCI data as a
means to incorporate domain knowledge and to reach competitive performance on
novel subjects with minimal calibration requirements.

Interfaces (APIs) to help end-users access their data, resources, and services.
Generally, API has many parameters that need to be entered. However, it is
challenging for users to understand and document these parameters correctly.
This paper develops an API workbench to help users learn and debug APIs. Based
on this workbench, much exploratory work has been proposed to reduce the
overhead of learning and debugging APIs. We explore the knowledge, such as
parameter characteristics (e.g., enumerability) and constraints (e.g.,
maximum/minimum value), from the massive API call logs to narrow the range of
parameter values. Then, we propose a fine-grained approach to enrich the API
documentation by extracting dependency knowledge between APIs. Finally, we
present a learning-based prediction method to predict API execution results
before the API is called, significantly reducing user debugging cycles. The
experiments evaluated on the online system show that this work's approach
substantially improves the user experience of debugging OpenAPIs.

self-consistent equation of motion for charged particle beams. This framework
is fundamentally altered if we include the fluctuating forces that originate
from the actual charge granularity. We thereby perform the transition from a
reversible description to a statistical mechanics' description covering also
the irreversible aspects of beam dynamics. Taking into account contributions
from fluctuating forces is mandatory if we want to describe effects like
intrabeam scattering or temperature balancing within beams. Furthermore, the
appearance of ``discreteness errors'' in computer simulations of beams can be
modeled as ``exact'' beam dynamics that is being modified by fluctuating
``error forces''. It will be shown that the related emittance increase depends
on two distinct quantities: the magnitude of the fluctuating forces embodied in
a friction coefficient $\gamma$, and the correlation time dependent average
temperature anisotropy. These analytical results are verified by various
computer simulations.

  via NLP applied to YouTube Subtitles","4 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  With recent advancements in computer vision as well as machine learning (ML),
video-based at-home exercise evaluation systems have become a popular topic of
current research. However, performance depends heavily on the amount of
available training data. Since labeled datasets specific to exercising are
rare, we propose a method that makes use of the abundance of fitness videos
available online. Specifically, we utilize the advantage that videos often not
only show the exercises, but also provide language as an additional source of
information. With push-ups as an example, we show that through the analysis of
subtitle data using natural language processing (NLP), it is possible to create
a labeled (irrelevant, relevant correct, relevant incorrect) dataset containing
relevant information for pose analysis. In particular, we show that irrelevant
clips ($n=332$) have significantly different joint visibility values compared
to relevant clips ($n=298$). Inspecting cluster centroids also show different
poses for the different classes.
